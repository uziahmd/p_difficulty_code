He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n The function for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n However, the problem asks: for a given m (number of trailing zeros), how many positive integers n have the property that n! has exactly m trailing zeros?\n\n Note: The sequence of trailing zeros in factorials is non-decreasing. But note that sometimes the count increases by more than one at a time (for example, from 24! to 25! we get an extra two zeros because 25 contributes two factors of 5). So the same number of trailing zeros might appear for consecutive numbers.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n 2. However, note that the problem says: \"the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes\". Also, note that the trailing zeros only increase at multiples of 5.\n\n Observation:\n   Let f(n) = Z(n) (the trailing zeros in n!)\n\n   Then, for a fixed m, we are looking for n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   But note: the function f(n) is non-decreasing and stepwise. It stays constant for a while and then jumps.\n\n   Example: \n        n=0,1,2,3,4 -> 0 zeros\n        n=5,6,7,8,9 -> 1 zero\n        n=10,11,12,13,14 -> 2 zeros\n        n=15,16,17,18,19 -> 2 zeros (same as above, because 15 doesn't add a 5? Actually, 15 adds one 5, but wait: 5*3=15, so 15 adds one 5. But then why does 10-14 have 2 zeros? \n        Actually, let's compute:\n\n        f(10) = floor(10/5) = 2\n        f(11)=2, f(12)=2, f(13)=2, f(14)=2, f(15)=floor(15/5)+floor(15/25)=3+0=3\n\n        Correction: Actually, 15: 15//5 = 3, but wait, 15//5=3 and 15//25=0, so 3. So from 10 to 14: 2 zeros, and 15: 3 zeros.\n\n        Actually, let me check with 25: \n        f(25) = 25//5 + 25//25 + 25//125 = 5+1+0 = 6.\n\n        The key is that when we have a multiple of 5^k, we add k factors of 5.\n\n   Therefore, the function f(n) is not strictly increasing, but it is non-decreasing.\n\n   We are to find all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   How to do it?\n\n   Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then, the numbers n that satisfy f(n)=m must lie in an interval [L, R) such that f(L)=m and f(R)=m+1 (or if there is no n with f(n)=m+1, then R is infinity? But note m>=1 and up to 100000, and we are dealing with factorials that grow very fast).\n\n   However, note: the problem requires positive integers n.\n\n   Important: We cannot iterate n from 1 upwards until we hit the required m (since m can be up to 100000, and the corresponding n could be very large, e.g., for m=100000, n is about 400000 or so? Actually, we can use binary search to find the boundaries).\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   Let L be the smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n   Then, the next jump (when the trailing zeros become m+1) happens at some R. Then the numbers n for which f(n)=m are the integers from L to R-1.\n\n   But note: sometimes m might not occur at all? Actually, the trailing zeros are non-decreasing and they start at ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is dictated by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). This count is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it \\( low \\)) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) and the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it \\( high \\)) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid numbers \\( n \\) will lie in the interval \\([low, high - 1]\\).\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., when \\( m \\) is very large such that even the maximum \\( n \\) considered doesn't reach \\( m \\)), the output should indicate zero solutions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    m = int(data[0])\n    \n    def trailing_zeros(n):\n        count = 0\n        divisor = 5\n        while divisor <= n:\n            count += n // divisor\n            divisor *= 5\n        return count\n\n    lo = 0\n    hi = 10**18\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            lo = mid + 1\n        else:\n            hi = mid\n            \n    low_bound = lo\n    hi = 10**18\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) < m + 1:\n            lo = mid + 1\n        else:\n            hi = mid\n            \n    high_bound = lo\n\n    if trailing_zeros(low_bound) != m:\n        print(\"0\")\n    else:\n        k = high_bound - low_bound\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = [str(i) for i in range(low_bound, high_bound)]\n            print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single integer \\( m \\), which is read from standard input.\n2. **Trailing Zeroes Calculation**: The function `trailing_zeros(n)` computes the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n3. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: The first binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) (low_bound) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\).\n4. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: The second binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) (high_bound) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\).\n5. **Output Handling**: If no \\( n \\) satisfies \\( Z(n) = m \\), the output is \"0\". Otherwise, the numbers from `low_bound` to `high_bound - 1` are printed, which are all \\( n \\) values where \\( n! \\) has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of valid \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to avoid brute-force methods.",
