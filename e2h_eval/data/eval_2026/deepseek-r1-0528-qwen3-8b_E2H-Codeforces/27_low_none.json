On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, note: The array only contains 1s and 2s.\n\n Since there are only two distinct numbers, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in any sequence of 1s and 2s is at least the total number of 1s (because you can take all 1s) plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1? Actually, we can also consider interleaving 1s and 2s.\n\n However, note that the operation is to reverse a contiguous interval. We are allowed to choose any contiguous interval [l, r] to reverse.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Without reversal, the original sequence has some LNDS. With reversal, we can change the order of a contiguous segment.\n\n Observation:\n Since the array is made up of only 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the entire array after reversal can be:\n\n   Option 1: Take all the 1s and then all the 2s.\n\n But note: we might not have all the 1s together or all the 2s together, but by reversing an interval we can rearrange a part.\n\n However, note that the reversal operation is limited to one contiguous segment. \n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Since n is at most 2000, we can try to consider the effect of reversing each possible contiguous segment? But that would be O(n^2) and then for each we need to compute the LNDS which is O(n) so overall O(n^3) -> 2000^3 = 8e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\n We need a smarter way.\n\n Insight:\n\n The entire sequence is made of 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in the new sequence can be:\n\n   - The entire sequence if it is non-decreasing? But we are allowed only one reversal.\n\n However, note that the reversal operation might be used to fix some parts. But note: the goal is the maximum possible length of the LNDS.\n\n Since the sequence is binary, the LNDS cannot exceed the total number of elements (n). And note that in any sequence of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can often get a long subsequence.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing one contiguous segment.\n\n Another idea: Since the array is binary, the entire sequence is non-decreasing if and only if there is no '2' followed by a '1'. So we can try to remove the inversions.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to reverse a contiguous segment. This reversal will fix the inversion in that segment, but might introduce new ones elsewhere?\n\n Alternatively, note that the entire sequence might not become non-decreasing, but we want the longest non-decreasing subsequence. The entire sequence is the best-case scenario (length n). Otherwise, the LNDS is the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing, but if not, we might have to drop some elements.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"maximum possible length\", so we want the highest LNDS we can achieve by reversing one contiguous segment.\n\n How can we think about the problem?\n\n Let:\n   total_ones = total number of 1s in the entire sequence.\n   total_twos = total number of 2s.\n\n The best LNDS we can possibly achieve is at least the total_ones + total_twos (if we can arrange the entire sequence to be non-decreasing) but note: we can only reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n However, the entire sequence might not be arranged by one reversal. But note: the reversal operation is contiguous. \n\n But note: the entire sequence being non-decreasing requires that all 1s come before all 2s. So if the original sequence does not have all 1s first and then 2s, we can try to reverse a segment that moves some 2s to the left or some 1s to the right? Actually, reversing a segment may bring 1s from the right to the left and 2s from the left to the right.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to reverse any contiguous segment. So we can consider:\n\n   Case 1: Reverse a segment that is entirely within the existing 1s or entirely within the existing 2s: then the sequence remains the same.\n\n   Case 2: Reverse a segment that spans from 1s to 2s. For example, if we have ... 1, then a block of 2s, then 1s ... then reversing that mixed part might help.\n\n Actually, the best we can do is to have as many 1s as possible at the beginning and then 2s. But note: we can only reverse one contiguous segment.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Without reversal, the entire sequence might have",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any one contiguous segment. The solution leverages the observation that the optimal LNDS is either the entire sequence if it can be made non-decreasing with a single reversal, or a combination of all 1s followed by all 2s if the entire sequence cannot be made non-decreasing.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The sequence consists only of 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in such a sequence is simply the count of all 1s followed by all 2s. The challenge is to determine if we can rearrange the sequence with one reversal to achieve this configuration.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal solution is achieved if we can arrange all 1s before all 2s. This is possible if the original sequence has some 1s after 2s, and reversing the segment between the last 1 before a 2 and the first 1 after a 2 can move all 1s to the front.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Case 1**: If the entire sequence is already non-decreasing (all 1s followed by all 2s), the answer is the length of the sequence.\n   - **Case 2**: If there are 1s after 2s, we identify the leftmost 1 following a 2 and the rightmost 2 preceding a 1. Reversing the segment between these points will move all 1s to the front, making the entire sequence non-decreasing.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves a single pass through the sequence to check for the condition, making it O(n) time complexity, which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 2000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    total_ones = sum(arr)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    if total_ones >= n:\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    found_ones_after_twos = False\n    for i in range(n):\n        if arr[i] == 1:\n            if i != 0 and arr[i-1] == 2:\n                found_ones_after_twos = True\n            continue\n        if arr[i] == 2:\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                if arr[j] == 1:\n                    found_ones_after_twos = True\n                    break\n            if found_ones_after_twos:\n                break\n                \n    if not found_ones_after_twos:\n        print(n)\n    else:\n        print(total_ones + total_twos)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the sequence length and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Case Check**: If all elements are 1s, the entire sequence is non-decreasing, so the answer is `n`.\n3. **Check for Optimal Condition**: The code checks if there exists any 1 that appears after a 2 in the sequence. If not, the sequence is already optimal, and the answer is `n`.\n4. **Optimal Reversal**: If there are 1s after 2s, reversing the appropriate segment allows all 1s to come before all 2s, making the entire sequence non-decreasing. The length of this sequence is `total_ones + total_twos`, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the optimal condition and computes the solution in linear time, making it suitable for the given problem constraints.",
