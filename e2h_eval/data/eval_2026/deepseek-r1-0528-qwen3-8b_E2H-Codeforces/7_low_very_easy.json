The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are to determine if there exists an integer k>1 such that a snowflake with n vertices can be constructed.\n\nThe snowflake construction:\n1. Start with 1 vertex (step 0).\n2. Then, we do at least one step of expansion: in each step, every leaf (vertex with degree 1) is connected to k new vertices.\n\nBut note: the process must be done at least once, meaning we have at least one expansion.\n\nLet's denote by d the number of expansion steps (at least 1).\n\nAt step 0: 1 vertex.\nAt step 1: 1 + k vertices.\nAt step 2: 1 + k + k*(k-1) [because the initial k vertices each get k-1 new ones?] \n\nWait, let me reexamine the rule:\n\nRule: \n  - Initially, one vertex.\n  - Then, the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices. Now we have 1 + k vertices.\n  - Then, \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) is connected to k more new vertices.\n\nBut note: after the first step, we have k leaves (the new vertices). Then we add k * k new vertices? Actually, no.\n\nHowever, the example for k=4: the smallest snowflake is shown. The figure would have:\n  Step0: 1\n  Step1: 1 + 4 = 5\n  Step2: 1 + 4 + 4*3 = 1 + 4 + 12 = 17?\n\nBut wait, the rule says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nActually, the process is:\n\nStep0: 1 node (degree 0 initially, but then it becomes connected to k nodes, so step1: the center node has degree k and the k new nodes have degree 1).\n\nThen step1: we take the k leaves and attach k new nodes to each. But note: when attaching, we are adding k nodes per leaf, so total nodes become 1 + k + k*k? \n\nWait, but in the example k=4: \n  After step0: 1\n  After step1: 1 + 4 = 5\n  After step2: 5 + 4*4 = 5+16=21? \n\nBut the problem says the smallest possible snowflake for k=4 is shown. Let me check the figure (if I recall correctly, the example might have been described differently). Alternatively, note the example input:\n\nInput: \n9\n1\n2\n3\n6\n13\n15\n255\n10101\n1000000000000000000\n\nOutput:\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\nSo for n=13 -> YES, n=15 -> YES, n=255 -> YES, n=10101 -> YES, n=10^18 -> NO.\n\nWhat does the construction look like?\n\nLet me define:\n  Let r = number of expansion steps (at least 1).\n\n  Step0: 1 node.\n\n  Step1: We add k nodes. Total nodes = 1 + k.\n\n  Step2: Each of the k leaves from step1 gets k new nodes. But note: the center node is not a leaf anymore (it has k edges). So we only expand from the k leaves. Then we add k*k nodes. Total nodes = 1 + k + k*k.\n\n  Step3: Now, the leaves from step2 are the k*k nodes we just added. Each of these will get k new nodes. Then we add k*k*k nodes. Total nodes = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nWait, but note: in step2, when we add k*k nodes, the original k leaves are no longer leaves (they now have two edges: one to the center and one to the new node we just attached). The new leaves are the k*k nodes we just added.\n\nSimilarly, in step3, we only expand from the k*k leaves.\n\nSo the total number of vertices after r steps is:\n\n  n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n\nBut note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we must have at least one expansion (so r>=1). However, note that the initial step (step0) is the center. Then we do step1 (first expansion) and then we can do step2, step3, etc.\n\nBut also note: the expansion condition: \"",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a single central vertex and expanding outward in each subsequent layer by connecting each leaf vertex to \\( k \\) new vertices, where \\( k > 1 \\). The key observation here is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must be the sum of a geometric series.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph's vertices are arranged in layers. The central vertex (layer 0) is connected to \\( k \\) vertices in layer 1. Each vertex in layer \\( i \\) (for \\( i \\geq 1 \\)) is connected to \\( k \\) vertices in layer \\( i+1 \\). The total number of vertices after \\( r \\) layers is given by the geometric series sum \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^r \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For \\( n \\) to be a valid snowflake graph, it must be expressible as the sum of a geometric series with ratio \\( k > 1 \\) and at least two terms (since the expansion must be done at least once). This translates to solving the equation \\( n = \\frac{k^{r+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\) for integers \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( r \\geq 1 \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Given the constraints \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we need an efficient method to check for the existence of such \\( k \\) and \\( r \\). The solution involves:\n   - Recognizing that \\( n \\) must be greater than 1 (since \\( k > 1 \\) and at least one expansion step).\n   - For each test case, checking if \\( n \\) can be written as \\( \\frac{k^{r+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( r \\geq 1 \\).\n\n4. **Optimization**: Instead of iterating over all possible \\( k \\) and \\( r \\) (which is infeasible for large \\( n \\)), we note that \\( r \\) must be at least 1. We can limit our search by considering that \\( k \\) must be less than \\( n \\) and that \\( r \\) is the number of layers minus one. The solution involves checking possible values of \\( k \\) derived from the divisors of \\( n-1 \\) or other mathematical properties.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    t = int(input().strip())\n    results = []\n    \n    def is_valid(n):\n        if n <= 1:\n            return False\n        # Check for small n: n=2,3,... but note the minimal snowflake requires at least 5 vertices (k=2, r=1: 1 + 2 = 3? Actually, let's recalc: \n        # For k=2, r=1: 1 + 2 = 3 -> n=3 is valid? But example input says n=6 is NO, n=13 is YES.\n        # Let me reexamine: \n        #   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n        #   For r=1: n = 1 + k -> so k = n-1, which must be >1 -> so n>=3 is valid by r=1?\n        #   But example: n=3 -> k=2, then the graph has 1 (center) + 2 (first layer) = 3 vertices. However, the rule says \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (the leaves) must be expanded at least once. But if we expand once, we have exactly 3 vertices. Then why is n=3 output as \"NO\"?\n        #   Let me read the problem again: \"This step should be done at least once.\" meaning the expansion step must be performed at least once. However, note the construction steps:\n        #       Step0: 1 vertex.\n        #       Step1: connect the center to k new vertices -> now we have 1+k vertices. This is the first expansion.\n        #       Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (the k new vertices) is connected to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n        #   So the problem says \"at least once\", meaning we must do the expansion from the leaves at least one time. In the case of k=2 and n=3, we have only done one expansion (from the center) but not the second expansion (from the leaves). Therefore, n=3 is invalid because we did not perform the required second expansion.\n        #\n        #   Correction: The problem states: \n        #       \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n        #       \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n        #\n        #   This implies two types of expansions:\n        #       Type 1: The initial expansion (from the center) is mandatory and counts as the first expansion step.\n        #       Type 2: The expansion from leaves is mandatory at least once, meaning we must have at least one round of Type 2 expansion.\n        #\n        #   Therefore, the minimal snowflake has at least two expansion steps (Type 1 and at least one Type 2). Hence, the minimal n is for k=2, r=2: \n        #       n = 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7.\n        #   But wait, the example input includes n=13 and n=15 as YES. Let's check:\n        #       For n=13: \n        #           r=1: n = 1 + k -> k=12 -> valid (if we consider only one expansion from the center and then stop, but the problem requires at least one expansion from the leaves, so we must have r>=2?).\n        #       However, note the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n        #       This means the process has two distinct phases:\n        #           Phase 1: Expand from the center (once, always).\n        #           Phase 2: Expand from leaves (at least once).\n        #       Therefore, the total layers are at least 2 (center, first layer, second layer). The total vertices would be 1 + k + k^2.\n        #       Now, for n=13: \n        #           1 + k + k^2 = 13  => k^2 + k - 12 = 0 -> k = (-1 ± sqrt(1+48))/2 = (-1 ± 7)/2 -> k=3 or k=-4. So k=3, then n=1+3+9=13 -> valid.\n        #       Similarly, n=15: \n        #           1 + k + k^2 = 15 -> k^2 + k -14=0 -> discriminant=57, not integer. But what if more layers? \n        #           Alternatively, n could be 1 + k (only one expansion) but that does not satisfy the leaf expansion condition. Or more than two layers?\n        #           For three layers: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 = 15 -> k^3 + k^2 + k -14=0. k=2: 8+4+2-14=0 -> valid. So n=15 is valid with k=2 and three layers (r=3).\n        #\n        #   Therefore, the general formula is: n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r, where r >= 1 (first expansion) and at least one more expansion (so the total layers are at least 2, meaning r>=1 in the exponent part? Actually, the number of expansions from leaves is r-1, but the total layers is r+1 (including the center). \n        #\n        #   Let me redefine:\n        #       Let m = number of expansion steps (from leaves) after the initial expansion. Then the total layers is m+1 (initial expansion plus m expansions from leaves). The total vertices is: 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m.\n        #       The problem requires at least one expansion from leaves, so m >= 1. Thus, the minimal total layers is 2 (center and two layers: the first expansion and the second expansion). Then the minimal n is 1 + k + k^2, with k>1.\n        #\n        #   But note: the example input includes n=6 as \"NO\". Let's check:\n        #       n=6: \n        #           Two layers: 1 + k + k^2 = 6 -> k^2 + k -5=0 -> discriminant=21, not integer.\n        #           Three layers: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 = 6 -> k^3 + k^2 + k -5=0. k=1: 1+1+1-5=-2; k=2: 8+4+2-5=9 -> too big. No solution.\n        #       Also, one expansion from leaves is required, so we cannot have just the center and one layer (n=1+k) unless we also do the leaf expansion. But if we do the leaf expansion, we must add k^2 vertices, making the total 1+k+k^2, which for k=2 is 7, etc.\n        #\n        #   Therefore, the minimal n is 7 (k=2, two layers). But the example input also includes n=13 and n=15 as YES, which are larger than 7. Also, n=255 and 10101 are YES, and n=10^18 is NO.\n        #\n        #   So the algorithm must check for any number of layers (at least two) and any k>1. However, note that \\( n = \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\) for r>=1 (number of layers) and k>=2.\n        #\n        #   Since \\( n \\) can be up to \\( 10^{18} \\), we cannot iterate over all possible k and r. Instead, we can consider that for a fixed r (number of layers), k is the positive real root of the equation \\( k^{r} + k^{r-1} + \\ldots + k + 1 = n \\). We can solve for k approximately and then check nearby integers.\n        #\n        #   Alternatively, note that for a fixed r, the equation \\( n = \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\) must hold. We can try small values of r (from 2 upwards) and for each r, solve for k. But how many r do we need to check?\n        #\n        #   Note: The maximum number of layers r is such that \\( k^{r+1} \\approx n \\). Since \\( k \\geq 2 \\), the maximum r is about \\( \\log_2(n) \\). For \\( n = 10^{18} \\), \\( \\log_2(10^{18}) \\approx 60 \\). So we can iterate over r from 2 to 60 (or until \\( k < 2 \\)).\n        #\n        #   Steps for a given n:\n        #       1. If n <= 1: NO.\n        #       2. Check for two layers (r=2): n = 1 + k + k^2. Then k^2 + k + 1 - n = 0. Solve for k: k = (-1 + sqrt(1+4*(n-1)))/2. Check if this k is an integer >1.\n        #       3. For three layers (r=3): n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. Solve for k: k^3 + k^2 + k + 1 - n = 0. We can approximate k by n^(1/3) and check nearby integers.\n        #       4. Continue similarly for higher layers until the computed k falls below 2.\n        #\n        #   However, note that the same n might be represented by different k and r. But we only need one representation.\n        #\n        #   But note: The equation for r layers is \\( n = \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\). We can also consider the reverse: for a given n, what are the possible k? Since k must be an integer >=2, we can factorize n-1 or use bounds to find k.\n        #\n        #   Alternatively, note that \\( n = 1 + k \\cdot (1 + k \\cdot (1 + \\ldots )) \\) (r times). This recursive structure suggests that k must be a divisor of (n - 1) in some way, but not exactly.\n        #\n        #   Another approach: \n        #       Let m = n - 1. Then the equation becomes \\( m = k \\cdot (1 + k \\cdot (1 + \\ldots )) \\) (r times). So m must be divisible by k, and the quotient must be 1 plus a similar expression.\n        #\n        #   However, due to the high constraints on n (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)), we need an efficient method. Here's a plan:\n        #       - For each test case, if n <= 1, output \"NO\".\n        #       - Check if n is a power of 2 minus 1 divided by k-1 for some k? Not exactly.\n        #       - We know that for the minimal case (two layers) we have n = 1 + k + k^2. Rearranged, k^2 + k + 1 - n = 0. The discriminant D = 1 - 4*(1-n) = 4*n - 3. Then k = (-1 + sqrt(D))/2 must be an integer. This gives a candidate for two layers.\n        #       - For three layers: n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. We can solve for k by approximating k ≈ n^(1/3) and checking floor and ceil.\n        #       - In general, for r layers, k is roughly n^(1/r). We can iterate r from 2 up to about 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18) and for each r, set k_min = floor(n^(1/r)) and check a few integers around k_min.\n        #\n        #   Steps:\n        #       For a given n (>=2):\n        #         Let found = False\n        #         For r in range(2, 61):   # r is the number of layers (at least 2)\n        #             Let low = 1\n        #             Let high = None\n        #             We know that k^r is roughly n (actually the sum is 1 + k + ... + k^r ≈ k^r / (k-1) for large k, but we can compute k_approx = (n * (k-1))^0.25 for r=2? Not straightforward.\n        #             Alternatively, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, n] such that the geometric series sum equals n, but that is too slow for large n.\n        #\n        #   A better approach is to note that for a fixed r, the equation is \\( k^r \\leq n < (k+1)^r \\) is not directly the sum. The sum is \\( \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\). We can compute the minimal k that could yield n by taking the (r+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1, but k is unknown.\n        #\n        #   Instead, we can iterate over possible k values? But k can be very large. Another idea: factorize n-1? Not necessarily.\n        #\n        #   After reconsideration, note that the problem can be simplified by realizing that the snowflake graph is equivalent to a rooted tree where each node (except leaves) has exactly k children. The total number of vertices is then \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^r \\). We need to check if there exists an integer k>1 and an integer r≥1 such that \\( n = \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\).\n        #\n        #   We can handle small n separately and for large n, iterate over possible r (number of layers) from 2 up to 60 (since \\( 2^{60} \\) is about 1e18). For each r, we solve for k in the equation \\( n = \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\). We can approximate k as the (r+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1, but we can instead use binary search for k in the range [2, n] for each r. However, doing a binary search for each r (up to 60) and each test case (up to 10^4 test cases) is too slow because 10^4 * 60 * log2(10^18) is about 10^4 * 60 * 60 = 36e6, which might be acceptable in C++ but in Python we need to be careful.\n        #\n        #   But note: t can be up to 10^4, and for each test case we might iterate r from 2 to 60 and for each r do a binary search over k from 2 to n (which is up to 10^18). The binary search for one r would take about log2(10^18) ≈ 60 steps. So total operations per test case: 60 * 60 = 3600, and for 10^4 test cases: 36e6, which is acceptable in Pyton if implemented efficiently.\n        #\n        #   However, we can optimize by noting that for a fixed r, the function f(k) = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing for k>1. We can binary search k in the range [2, n] such that f(k) = n.\n        #\n        #   Steps for one test case:\n        #       if n <= 1: \"NO\"\n        #       elif n == 2: \"NO\" (since k>1 and at least two layers require at least 1+2+4=7 for k=2, but wait, two layers: 1+k+k^2. For k=2: 1+2+4=7. n=2: no solution)\n        #       We can handle n=2,3,...,6 as \"NO\" because they cannot be expressed as the sum of at least two layers (minimal n is 7 for k=2, two layers).\n        #       But wait, n=7: 1+2+4=7 -> valid.\n        #       However, the example input includes n=13 and 15 as YES, which are larger than 7.\n        #\n        #   But note: the example input also includes n=6 as \"NO\", which is correct because 6 cannot be expressed as the sum for any k>1 and r>=2.\n        #\n        #   Implementation of binary search for fixed r:\n        #       low_k = 2\n        #       high_k = n\n        #       while low_k <= high_k:\n        #           mid_k = (low_k + high_k) // 2\n        #           s = (mid_k**(r+1) - 1) // (mid_k - 1)\n        #           But note: mid_k**(r+1) might be too large to compute for mid_k even 2 and r=60 -> 2^61 is around 2e18, which is acceptable for Python integers, but we must be cautious of overflow? Actually, for mid_k=2 and r=60, 2^61 is about 2e18, which is within Python's integer range, but for larger mid_k, say mid_k=10 and r=60, 10^61 is too big to represent. We need to avoid computing mid_k**(r+1) when mid_k is large.\n        #\n        #   Alternative: We can use logarithms to estimate k, but then we need exact integer arithmetic.\n        #\n        #   Another approach: Rearrange the equation. We have \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^r \\). This is equivalent to \\( n = \\frac{k^{r+1} - 1}{k-1} \\). We can write \\( k^{r+1} = n(k-1) + 1 \\). For a fixed r, we can solve for k by taking the (r+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1, but k is unknown.\n        #\n        #   Given the complexity and constraints, a more efficient method is to iterate over possible k values that are factors of n-1 or something similar, but note the equation involves a sum of powers.\n        #\n        #   Let's try a different approach: \n        #       We know that for a given n, the minimal number of layers is 2. The maximal number of layers is the largest r such that 2^r + 2^(r-1) + ... + 1 <= n. Since the sum is 2^(r+1)-1, we require 2^(r+1)-1 <= n. So r <= log2(n+1)-1. For n=10^18, r_max is about 60.\n        #\n        #   We can iterate r from 2 to r_max (about 60) and for each r, solve for k in the equation \\( k^{r+1} - (k-1)*n - 1 = 0 \\). We can approximate k by k0 = round((n)**(1/(r+1))) and then check a few integers around k0.\n        #\n        #   Steps for fixed r:\n        #       Let k_low = max(2, floor((n)**(1/(r+1))) - 5)\n        #       Let k_high = ceil((n)**(1/(r+1))) + 5\n        #       Then iterate k from k_low to k_high and check if \\( \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} == n \\).\n        #\n        #   But note: k must be an integer. And we must compute \\( \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\) exactly. However, k^(r+1) might be very large for large r and k. But since we are only iterating k in a small range (from k_low to k_high, which is at most 10-20 numbers), and r is at most 60, we can compute k^(r+1) for these k values. But for k=10 and r=60, 10^61 is a number with 61 digits, which is manageable in Python with big integers, but we must be cautious of performance.\n        #\n        #   Considering the worst-case scenario: t=10^4 test cases, and for each test case we iterate r from 2 to 60 (59 iterations) and for each r we check up to 20 k values, so 59*20 = 1180 checks per test case. For 10^4 test cases, that's 11.8e6 checks, which is acceptable in Python if the exponentiation is optimized.\n        #\n        #   However, note that exponentiation for k^(r+1) with k=10 and r=60 (i.e., 10^61) is a big number but Python can handle it. But we must ensure that we don't time out. 11.8e6 exponentiations of numbers up to 10^61 might be heavy in Python.\n        #\n        #   We can optimize by breaking early if k is too large: if k^(r+1) is already greater than n*(k-1)+1 (which is the equation k^(r+1) = n*(k-1)+1), but note n = (k^(r+1)-1)/(k-1), so k^(r+1) = n*(k-1)+1. We can compute the left side and compare.\n        #\n        #   Alternatively, we can use logarithms to estimate the required k and narrow down the range, but then we need exact integer matching.\n        #\n        #   Given the constraints, we'll implement the following for each test case:\n        #       if n <= 6: \n        #           \"NO\"\n        #       else:\n        #           found = False\n        #           r_max = min(60, n.bit_length())   # since 2^r_max ~ n, so r_max ~ log2(n)\n        #           for r in range(2, r_max+1):\n        #               # Estimate k0 = round(n**(1/(r+1)))\n        #               # But n**(1/(r+1)) might be a float and lose precision for large n.\n        #               # Instead, we can use: k_low = 2, k_high = n, but that's too wide.\n        #               # Better: use the fact that k^(r+1) ≈ n*(k-1). For large k, k^(r+1) dominates, so k ≈ n**(1/(r+1)).\n        #               base = n**(1/(r+1))\n        #               k_low = max(2, int(base) - 5)\n        #               k_high = int(base) + 5\n        #               # But base might be fractional, and we want integer k.\n        #               for k in range(k_low, k_high+1):\n        #                   if k == 1:\n        #                       continue\n        #                   # Compute S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r\n        #                   # We can compute this without floating point inaccuracies by using pow(k, r+1) and then (pow(k, r+1)-1)//(k-1)\n        #                   try:\n        #                       total = (pow(k, r+1) - 1) // (k - 1)\n        #                   except ZeroDivisionError:\n        #                       continue\n        #                   if total == n:\n        #                       found = True\n        #                       break\n        #               if found:\n        #                   break\n        #           if found:\n        #               \"YES\"\n        #           else:\n        #               \"NO\"\n        #\n        #   However, note that the equation \\( n = \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\) must hold exactly. The above method uses integer arithmetic for the total, which is exact.\n        #\n        #   But wait, what if k is very large such that k^(r+1) exceeds the maximum integer? In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, but the computation might be slow. However, our k is bounded by about n**(1/(r+1)) + 5, which for r=2 is about sqrt(n) + 5, and for n=10^18, sqrt(n)=10^9, which is too many to iterate over. But note: we are only iterating over a window of 10-20 k values, not from 2 to n.\n        #\n        #   But the estimation base = n**(1/(r+1)) might be inaccurate for large n and small r. For example, for r=2, base = n**(1/3). For n=10^18, base = 10^6, which is exact. But for n=13, r=2: base = 13**(1/3) ≈ 2.35, so k_low = max(2, 2.35-5)=2, k_high=2+5=7. Then we check k from 2 to 7. For k=3: (3^3-1)//2 = (27-1)//2 = 13 -> matches.\n        #\n        #   But for n=15, r=3: base = 15**(1/4) ≈ 1.96, so k_low = max(2, 1.96-5)=2, k_high=7. Then for k=2, r=3: (2^4-1)//1 = 15 -> matches.\n        #\n        #   However, what if the estimated base is not accurate enough? We might miss the correct k if it is outside the window. To be safe, we can increase the window to, say, 100, but that might be too slow for large n and small r (like r=2, n=10^18, base=10^6, then k_low=10^6-50, k_high=10^6+50, which is 100 values, acceptable).\n        #\n        #   But note: for large n and small r, base is large (e.g., r=2, base ~ sqrt(n)), and we are iterating 100 values. For n=10^18, sqrt(n)=10^9, so we would be iterating from 10^9-50 to 10^9+50, which is 100 values, but computing (k^3-1)//(k-1) for k around 10^9 is feasible because k^3 is 10^27, which is a big number but Python can handle it. However, 10^4 test cases * 60 (max r) * 100 (window) = 60e6 computations, each requiring a cube or higher power? For r=2, we compute k^3, which is 10^27, but for r=60, k is about 10^18^(1/61) which is around 10^(18/61) ≈ 10^0.3, so k is about 2, so the window is small. Actually, the window size is fixed (say 100) regardless of k, but for large k (like 10^9) and r=2, we do 100 exponentiations of numbers around 10^9 to the power 3, which is 10^27, which is acceptable in terms of representation but might be slow in Python for 60e6 such operations.\n        #\n        #   We must optimize further. Notice that for a fixed r, the equation \\( n = \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\) can be rewritten as \\( k^{r+1} = n(k-1) + 1 \\). We can check this equation without computing the entire sum. Moreover, we can break early if k^(r+1) exceeds n*(k-1)+1.\n        #\n        #   However, given the complexity and the fact that the window is only 100 values and the exponents are not too large (because r is at most 60 and k is estimated from n), we can proceed with the current method and hope that the input n values are not pathological.\n        #\n        #   But note: the problem constraints say n can be up to 10^18, and we are iterating over 10^4 test cases. 10^4 * 60 * 100 = 60e6 checks, each involving an exponentiation to the power up to 61. The exponentiation for k=10^9 and exponent 3 (for r=2) is 10^27, which is a big number but Python can handle it. However, 60e6 such exponentiations might be slow in Python.\n        #\n        #   We need to optimize the inner loop. Instead of computing the full sum, we can use the equation \\( k^{r+1} = n(k-1) + 1 \\) to check. But note, the sum is exactly \\( \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\), so the equation \\( k^{r+1} = n(k-1) + 1 \\) must hold. We can compute k^(r+1) and compare it to n*(k-1)+1. This avoids the division and the summation, but still requires exponentiating k to the power r+1.\n        #\n        #   Steps for fixed r and k:\n        #       left = pow(k, r+1)\n        #       right = n*(k-1) + 1\n        #       if left == right:\n        #           found = True\n        #\n        #   This is an exact check and avoids potential rounding errors from the summation formula.\n        #\n        #   Now, let's code accordingly.\n        #\n        #   Special note: When k=1, the formula breaks (division by zero), but k>=2 by our iteration.\n        #\n        #   However, there is a caveat: the equation \\( k^{r+1} = n(k-1) + 1 \\) is derived from the sum formula, so they are equivalent.\n        #\n        #   Let's test with n=13, r=2, k=3:\n        #       left = 3^3 = 27\n        #       right = 13*(3-1)+1 = 13*2+1 = 27 -> matches.\n        #   n=15, r=3, k=2:\n        #       left = 2^4 = 16\n        #       right = 15*(2-1)+1 = 15+1 = 16 -> matches.\n        #\n        #   This method is faster because it avoids the summation and uses a direct comparison.\n        #\n        #   Implementation:\n        #       for each test case:\n        #         if n <= 6:\n        #             \"NO\"\n        #         else:\n        #             found = False\n        #             r_max = min(60, n.bit_length())  # because 2^r_max is about n, so r_max is roughly log2(n)\n        #             # But note: the number of layers r, so we iterate r from 2 to r_max.\n        #             for r in range(2, r_max+1):\n        #                 # Estimate k0 = round(n**(1/(r+1)))\n        #                 # But n**(1/(r+1)) might be a float and imprecise. Use logarithms or other methods? \n        #                 # Alternatively, we can use a different approach: the equation is k^(r+1) = n*(k-1)+1.\n        #                 # We can solve for k by considering that k is roughly the (r+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1. But k-1 is roughly k, so k is roughly the (r+1)-th root of n*k, which is circular.\n        #                 # We'll use the same estimation: base = n**(1/(r+1))\n        #                 base = n**(1/(r+1))\n        #                 k_low = max(2, int(base) - 100)\n        #                 k_high = int(base) + 100\n        #                 for k in range(k_low, k_high+1):\n        #                     if k == 1:\n        #                         continue\n        #                     # Compute left = k^(r+1)\n        #                     left_val = pow(k, r+1)\n        #                     right_val = n*(k-1) + 1\n        #                     if left_val == right_val:\n        #                         found = True\n        #                         break\n        #                     # We can also break early if left_val > right_val and since k is increasing, left_val will only get bigger, but note: the equation is for fixed r, and k increases, left_val increases faster than right_val? Actually, for fixed r, left_val = k^(r+1) and right_val = n*k - n + 1. The function k^(r+1) grows faster than linear, so once left_val > right_val, we can break out of the inner loop for this r and k, but note that the next k might be smaller? No, k is increasing. However, for a fixed r, as k increases, left_val increases faster than right_val, so if for a given k, left_val > right_val, then for larger k it will be even bigger. But wait, we are iterating k from low to high, and we are checking for equality. However, it is possible that for a given r, there might be two k's that satisfy the equation? Unlikely because the left_val grows much faster.\n        #                     # But to be safe, we can break out of the inner loop if left_val > right_val and since k is increasing, there won't be a solution for larger k in this r.\n        #                     # However, note: the equation might be satisfied for a larger k if n is very large? Actually, no: for fixed r, the function f(k) = k^(r+1) - n*k + (n-1) is strictly convex and has at most two roots. But we are only searching in a window around the estimated base. It's possible that the actual k is outside the window. But we increased the window to 200.\n        #                 if found:\n        #                     break\n        #             if found:\n        #                 \"YES\"\n        #             else:\n        #                 \"NO\"\n        #\n        #   But note: the equation \\( k^{r+1} = n(k-1)+1 \\) must hold. This is equivalent to the sum formula.\n        #\n        #   However, there is a possibility that the estimated base is not accurate enough and we miss the k. To mitigate this, we can also try a different approach: iterate over possible k values that are factors of n-1 or use other mathematical properties, but that might be complex.\n        #\n        #   Considering the time constraints, we'll go with the above method and hope that the window of 200 around the estimated base catches the correct k.\n        #\n        #   Edge: n=7: \n        #       r=2: base = 7**(1/3) ≈ 1.91, so k_low = max(2, 1.91-100)=2, k_high=102.

So indeed, 100^3=1000000, so k=100, r=2: \n        #           n = (100^3-1)//99 = (1000000-1)//99 = 999999//99 = 10101. Yes! So n=10101 is valid.\n        #       Why didn't our estimation catch it? \n        #           base = 10101**(1/3) ≈ 21.5, so we iterated k from 12 to 122. But 100 is within this range? 21.5-100 = negative, so k_low=12, k_high=122. 100 is between 12 and 122, so we should have checked k=100.\n        #       How did we compute base? base = 10101**(1/3) ≈ 21.5, then k_low = max(2, 21.5-100)=2, k_high=21.5+100=121.5 -> 121. So k=100 is included.\n        #       Then why didn't we find it? Because in the inner loop for r=2, k=100:\n        #           left_val = 100^3 = 1000000\n        #           right_val = 10101*(100-1)+1 = 10101*99+1 = 10101*(100-1)+1 = 1010100 - 10101 + 1 = 1010100 - 10100 = 1000000 -> matches.\n        #       So we would have found it.\n        #\n        #   The last example: n=1000000000000000000 (10^18)\n        #       We need to check if there exists r and k such that k^(r+1) = 10^18*(k-1)+1.\n        #       This is unlikely because the left side is a power and the right side is linear in k. For example, for r=2: k^3 = 10^18*k - 10^18 + 1. The cubic equation might have solutions, but k would be around 10^6 (since (10^6)^3 = 10^18). Let's check k=10^6: \n        #           left_val = (10^6)^3 = 10^18\n        #           right_val = 10^18*(10^6-1)+1 = 10^24 - 10^18 + 1 -> not equal.\n        #       For r=1: not allowed (at least two layers). For r=2, k must satisfy k^3 = 10^18*k - 10^18 + 1. Rearranged: k^3 - 10^18*k + 10^18 - 1 = 0. The solution k≈10^6 is not exact. \n        #       In fact, the example output says \"NO\", so we must not find any (r,k) for n=10^18.\n        #\n        #   Therefore, the code below implements the described method. We set a window of 100 around the estimated base for each r from 2 to min(60, n.bit_length()). If any (r,k) satisfies the equation, we output \"YES\"; otherwise, after all r and k are exhausted, we output \"NO\".\n\nHowever, after careful thought, note that the above approach might be too slow for the worst-case scenario (many test cases) because for each test case we iterate over up to 60 values of r and for each r up to 200 values of k, and each iteration requires an exponentiation which can be expensive for large exponents and bases. \n\nA more efficient approach is to recognize that the equation \\( n = \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\) can be rewritten as \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^r \\). For a fixed k, the minimal n is achieved when r=1 (n=1+k) and increases with r. But we need to check for any k>1 and r>=1 (with at least two layers, so r>=2). \n\nAlternatively, we can factorize n-1 and look for factors that fit the form, but that might be complex.\n\nGiven the time constraints, we'll implement the above method with optimizations:\n\n1. **Early termination**: If we find any valid (r,k), break out of the loops.\n2. **Use logarithms to estimate k**: For each r, estimate k0 = n**(1/(r+1)), and then check k from floor(k0) to ceil(k0) and a bit around, but not too many.\n3. **Break early in the inner loop**: If for a given k, k^(r+1) > n*(k-1)+1 and since k is increasing, we can break out of the inner loop for this r.\n\nBut note: the equation \\( k^{r+1} = n(k-1)+1 \\) is not monotonic in the usual sense for fixed r? Actually, for fixed r, both sides are increasing functions of k, but the left side grows faster. Therefore, once for a given k we have k^(r+1) > n*(k-1)+1, then for all larger k in this r, the inequality will hold, so we can break out of the inner loop.\n\nLet's implement accordingly.\n\n### Final Code\nWe'll use the following steps for each test case:\n\n1. If \\( n \\leq 6 \\), output \"NO\".\n2. Otherwise, iterate over r from 2 to min(60, n.bit_length()):\n   a. Compute base = n**(1/(r+1)) (using floating point).\n   b. Set k_low = max(2, floor(base) - 100) and k_high = ceil(base) + 100.\n   c. For each k from k_low to k_high:\n      i. Compute left_val = k**(r+1)\n      ii. Compute right_val = n*(k-1) + 1\n      iii. If left_val == right_val, set found=True and break out of both loops.\n      iv. If left_val > right_val, break out of the inner loop (since k is increasing and left_val grows faster).\n3. Output \"YES\" if found, else \"NO\".\n\nNote: We must be cautious with floating-point inaccuracies in estimating base. For very large n, n**(1/(r+1)) might not be precise. However, for r>=2 and n up to 10^18, the floating-point representation should be sufficient to guide us to the ballpark.\n\nLet's run through the examples with the code logic:\n\n- Example n=7: r=2, base=7**(1/3)≈1.91, k_low=2, k_high=102. For k=2: left_val=8, right_val=7*1+1=8 -> found.\n- Example n=13: r=2, base=13**(1/3)≈2.35, k_low=2, k_high=103. For k=3: left_val=27, right_val=13*2+1=27 -> found.\n- Example n=15: r=3, base=15**(1/4)≈1.96, k_low=2, k_high=102. For k=2: left_val=16, right_val=15*1+1=16 -> found.\n- Example n=255: r=7, base=255**(1/8)≈2. something, k_low=2, k_high=103. For k=2: left_val=2^8=256, right_val=255*1+1=256 -> found.\n- Example n=10101: r=2, base=10101**(1/3)≈21.5, k_low=2, k_high=122. For k=100: left_val=100^3=1000000, right_val=10101*99+1=1000000 -> found.\n- Example n=1000000000000000000: We need to check all r from 2 to about 60. For each r, we check k around base = (10^18)**(1/(r+1)). For r=2, base≈10^6, then k_low=10^6-100, k_high=10^6+100. Check k=10^6: left_val=(10^6)^3=10^18, right_val=10^18*(10^6-1)+1=10^24 - 10^18 + 1 -> not equal. And left_val=10^18 < right_val=10^24, so we continue. But then we break the inner loop when left_val > right_val? In this case, for k=10^6, left_val=10^18 < right_val=10^24, so we continue to k=10^6+1, etc. But note: for k=10^6+1, left_val=(10^6+1)^3 = 10^18+3*10^12+3*10^6+1, right_val=10^18*(10^6) + 1 = 10^24+1 -> still left_val < right_val. In fact, for k>=2 and r=2, left_val = k^3, right_val = n*k - n + 1 = 10^18*k - 10^18 + 1. For k=10^6, left_val=10^18, right_val=10^24-10^18+1, which is much larger. So we will never have left_val==right_val for r=2 and any k in the range. Similarly for other r. We must check all r and k in the window, but the window is fixed and the exponentiation might be heavy, but the window is only 200 per r, and r goes up to 60, so 60*200=12000 exponentiations per test case, and with 10^4 test cases, that's 120e6 exponentiations, which is too many.\n\nTherefore, we must optimize further. \n\nAlternative approach: Instead of iterating over r and k, we can iterate over possible k values that are factors of n-1 or use the fact that k must divide n-1 in some way. However, the equation is not a simple divisibility.\n\nAnother alternative: Notice that for a fixed k, the minimal n is 1+k (r=1) and then increases with r. But we require r>=2. We can solve for r in terms of k: \\( r = \\log_k(n \\cdot (k-1) + 1) \\). But then we need to check if r is an integer and r>=2.\n\nBut then how to choose k? k can be any integer >1, and n can be up to 10^18. \n\nAfter reevaluation, the intended solution might be to check for each test case if n is of the form \\( \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\) for some integer k>1 and integer r>=1 (with at least one expansion from leaves, so r>=2). \n\nThere is a known result that the only numbers that are not of the form \\( \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\) for some k>1 and r>=2 are those that are either prime or have certain properties, but I'm not sure.\n\nHowever, the sample inputs suggest that the answer is \"YES\" for n=13,15,255,10101 and \"NO\" for n=1,2,3,6,10^18.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the problem is from a programming competition, there might be a simpler mathematical insight.\n\nInsight: The snowflake graph with k branches and r layers (counting the center as layer0) has n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^r vertices. This is the same as the number of nodes in a rooted tree with branching factor k and depth r+1 (root at depth0, then depth1 has k nodes, etc.). \n\nNow, note that for r>=1 (at least two layers), n must be at least 1+k+k^2 >= 7 (for k=2). \n\nAlso, n must be expressible as a geometric series sum. \n\nBut there is a well-known sequence: the numbers that are the sum of a geometric series with integer ratio>1 and at least two terms (i.e., r>=2) are called \"repunits\" in base k, but not exactly.\n\nActually, the numbers that can be represented as \\( \\frac{k^{r+1}-1}{k-1} \\) are called \"repunits\" in base k with r+1 digits, but note that the standard repunit has all digits 1, and here the base is k and the number is 111...1 (r+1 ones) in base k. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: is n a repunit number in some base k>1 with at least 3 digits (since r>=2 means at least 3 digits: digits at positions 0,1,2)?\n\nBut note: the repunit in base k with d digits is \\( \\frac{k^d - 1}{k-1} \\). In our case, d = r+1 >=3.\n\nNow, how to check if n is a repunit in some base k>1 with at least 3 digits?\n\nWe can iterate over possible digit lengths d from 3 to about 60 (since k>=2, the smallest repunit with d digits is (2^d-1) which for d=60 is about 1e18, so d up to 60). For each d, we need to solve for k in the equation \\( \\frac{k^d - 1}{k-1} = n \\). This is a polynomial equation of degree d-1 in k.\n\nBut note: the equation is \\( k^d - 1 = n(k-1) \\). We can rearrange to \\( k^d - n*k + (n-1) = 0 \\). For fixed d, we can solve for k by trying integer values. The minimal k is 2, and the maximal k is n (since for k=n, the left side is n^d - 1, which is huge). But we can use binary search for k in [2, n] such that the equation holds.\n\nBut again, for each test case and each d from 3 to 60, we do a binary search over k from 2 to n, which is too slow.\n\nHowever, note that for fixed d, k must be roughly the d-th root of n*d or something. We can estimate k as approximately n**(1/d). Then we can check a small range of k around that estimate.\n\nSteps for a given n:\n   if n <= 6: \"NO\"\n   else:\n        found = False\n        for d in range(3, 61):   # d is the number of digits (at least 3)\n            # Estimate k0 = n**(1/d)\n            k0 = n**(1/d)\n            # k_low = floor(k0) - 100, k_high = ceil(k0) + 100, but k>=2\n            k_low = max(2, int(k0) - 100)\n            k_high = int(k0) + 100\n            for k in range(k_low, k_high+1):\n                # Compute repunit = (k**d - 1) // (k-1)\n                # But we can also compute from the equation: k^d = n*(k-1) + 1\n                left_val = pow(k, d)\n                right_val = n*(k-1) + 1\n                if left_val == right_val:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                if left_val > right_val:\n                    # Since k is increasing, we can break early for this d\n                    break\n            if found:\n                break\n        if found:\n            \"YES\"\n        else:\n            \"NO\"\n\nBut note: the equation is \\( \\frac{k^d - 1}{k-1} = n \\), which is equivalent to \\( k^d - 1 = n(k-1) \\), i.e., \\( k^d = n(k-1) + 1 \\).\n\nThis is the same as before, but now we are iterating over d (digit length) from 3 to 60 instead of r (layers) from 2 to 60. \n\nThe advantage is that d is the total number of layers+1, so d>=3. This is equivalent.\n\nLet's test with the examples:\n\n- n=7: d=3, k0=7**(1/3)≈1.91, k_low=2, k_high=102. For k=2: left_val=8, right_val=7*1+1=8 -> found.\n- n=13: d=3, k0=13**(1/3)≈2.35, k_low=2, k_high=103. For k=3: left_val=27, right_val=13*2+1=27 -> found.\n- n=15: d=4, k0=15**(1/4)≈1.96, k_low=2, k_high=102. For k=2: left_val=16, right_val=15*1+1=16 -> found.\n- n=255: d=8, k0=255**(1/8)≈2. something, k_low=2, k_high=103. For k=2: left_val=256, right_val=255*1+1=256 -> found.\n- n=10101: d=3, k0=10101**(1/3)≈21.5, k_low=2, k_high=122. For k=100: left_val=1000000, right_val=10101*99+1=1000000 -> found.\n- n=1000000000000000000: We need to check d from 3 to 60. For each d, we check k around 10^18**(1/d). For d=3, k0≈10^6, and we check k from 10^6-100 to 10^6+100. As before, no match. Similarly for other d, no match -> \"NO\".\n\nThis is the same as the previous method, but now we are iterating over d instead of r. The number of iterations is the same (58 for d from 3 to 60) and the inner loop is the same (200 iterations). \n\nBut note: d is the number of digits, which is r+1, so d=r+1. Previously, we were iterating r from 2 to 60, so d from 3 to 61. The range is the same.\n\nWe can choose either. Let's stick with the original variable r (number of layers) from 2 to 60, which is clearer.\n\nFinal implementation with optimizations for early termination and breaking out of the inner loop when left_val > right_val.\n\nHowever, note that the equation \\( k^d = n(k-1)+1 \\) might have k such that k^d is very large, but d is at most 60 and k is estimated from n**(1/d), so k is not too large. \n\nWe'll implement the following:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nt = int(input().strip())\nresults = []\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    if n <= 6:\n        results.append(\"NO\")\n        continue\n        \n    found = False\n    # The number of layers r must be at least 2 (so d = r+1 >=3)\n    # We'll iterate r from 2 to 60 (max layers)\n    for r in range(2, 61):\n        # d = r+1, the number of digits in the repunit\n        # Estimate k0 = n**(1/(r+1))\n        try:\n            k0 = n**(1/(r+1))\n        except OverflowError:\n            k0 = 0\n        k_low = max(2, int(k0) - 100)\n        k_high = int(k0) + 100\n        \n        # If k_high is greater than n, we can set an upper bound to n, but usually k0 is around n**(1/(r+1)) which is much smaller than n for large r.\n        # Iterate k from k_low to k_high\n        for k in range(k_low, k_high+1):\n            try:\n                left_val = pow(k, r+1)\n            except OverflowError:\n                # If k is too large, left_val will be astronomical. Skip if left_val is too large.\n                continue\n            right_val = n * (k-1) + 1\n            \n            if left_val == right_val:\n                found = True\n                break\n            if left_val > right_val:\n                # Since k is increasing, and left_val grows faster than right_val, we can break early.\n                break\n        if found:\n            break\n            \n    if found:\n        results.append(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        results.append(\"NO\")\n\n# Output each result on separate lines\nfor res in results:\n    print(res)\n```\n\nBut wait, the above code may not work for n=10^18 because for r=2, k0 = 10^18**(1/3) = 10^6, and then we compute pow(k, 3) for k from 10^6-100 to 10^6+100. This involves numbers like (10^6)^3 = 10^18, which is manageable, but for r=60, k0 = 10^18**(1/61) is a very small number (close to 1), so k_low = max(2, int(1)-100)=2, k_high=101.
