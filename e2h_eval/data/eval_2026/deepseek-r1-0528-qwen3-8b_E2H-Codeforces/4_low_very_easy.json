The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (i.e., losses) for each player over n rounds.\n Since n can be up to 2e9 and the sequences A and B have at most 1000 characters, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Instead, we note that the two players use cyclic sequences. Therefore, the game repeats every LCM(len(A), len(B)) rounds?\n However, note: we are not required to compute the entire cycle necessarily. We can break the problem into:\n\n Let m = len(A), k = len(B)\n In each round i (0-indexed from 0 to n-1):\n   Nikephoros uses A[i % m]\n   Polycarpus uses B[i % k]\n\n We need to count:\n   For each round, if the result is a loss for Nikephoros, then increment his red spots.\n   Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n But note: In a round, there are three possibilities:\n   Draw: no red spot.\n   Otherwise, one of the two wins. The loser gets a red spot.\n\n How to determine who loses?\n   Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n   Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n   Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\n Alternatively, we can define a mapping or function that tells who wins.\n\n However, since n is very large, we need to count without iterating through all n rounds.\n\n Idea: Precompute for one full cycle (which is LCM(m, k) rounds) the number of losses for each player.\n\n But note: the cycles of A and B are independent. The total rounds in the game is n, which might not be a multiple of the cycle.\n\n However, the state at round i is determined by (i % m, i % k). The pair (i % m, i % k) repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds? Actually, the period is the least common multiple of m and k, but note: the condition for repetition is when both i mod m and i mod k repeat, and that happens at LCM(m,k).\n\n But note: n can be up to 2e9 and m, k up to 1000. The LCM might be as large as 1e6 (since 1000*1000 = 1e6, but actually LCM(m,k) <= m*k <= 1e6). However, 2e9 / (1e6) is 2000, so we could precompute one cycle (of length L = LCM(m,k)) and then multiply by the number of full cycles, and then simulate the remainder.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Compute L = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) / GCD(m, k). But note: we are dealing with integers, so we can compute GCD first.\n\n 2. Precompute an array for one cycle (of length L) that stores:\n      - The outcome (who loses) for each round in the cycle.\n\n 3. Then, the total number of rounds is n. We can break it into:\n      full_cycles = n // L\n      remainder = n % L\n\n 4. Then, total losses for Nikephoros = full_cycles * (losses in one cycle for Nikephoros) + losses in the first 'remainder' rounds for Nikephos.\n    Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n But wait: the cycle length L is LCM(m,k). However, note that the two sequences are independent and we are using i from 0 to L-1 for the cycle. But the cycle is defined by the combined state (i mod m, i mod k). \n\n However, note: the round index i goes from 0 to n-1. In the cycle, we consider i from 0 to L-1, and then the same pattern repeats.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid computing the LCM by considering the two sequences separately and use the fact that the entire game is periodic with period L = LCM(m,k). But note: the indices for A and B are determined by i, so the round i is determined by (i mod m, i mod k). And the pair (i mod m, i mod k) will repeat every LCM(m,k) rounds.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read n, then string A and string B.\n\n 2. Let m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n 3. Compute L = LCM(m, k). We can compute GCD first.\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    L = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n 4. Now, if n >= L, then we can break the rounds into full cycles and a remainder.\n\n 5. However, note: we cannot precompute an",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge lies in efficiently handling very large `n` (up to 2 billion) without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use repeating sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). The outcome of each round depends on the current moves of both players. The goal is to count the total losses (red spots) for each player over `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `LCM(len(A), len(B))` rounds. This periodicity allows us to compute the results for one full cycle and then extrapolate for multiple cycles, plus handle any remaining rounds after complete cycles.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in one cycle, determine the winner and loser. Count the losses for each player during this cycle.\n   - **Extrapolation**: Multiply the cycle losses by the number of full cycles. Then, simulate the remaining rounds (if any) to adjust the counts.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodicity of the sequences. The simulation of one cycle is O(m*k), which is feasible since the sequence lengths are at most 1000 (resulting in a cycle length of up to 1,000,000 operations).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    L = (m * k) // g\n    \n    cycle_nike_losses = 0\n    cycle_poly_losses = 0\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        \n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'R'):\n            cycle_nike_losses += 1\n        elif (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n             (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'S'):\n            cycle_poly_losses += 1\n        elif (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R') or \\\n             (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'P'):\n            cycle_poly_losses += 1\n            \n    full_cycles = n // L\n    remainder = n % L\n    \n    nike_total = full_cycles * cycle_nike_losses\n    poly_total = full_cycles * cycle_poly_losses\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        \n        if (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'S') or \\\n           (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'R'):\n            nike_total += 1\n        elif (a_char == 'S' and b_char == 'P') or \\\n             (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'S'):\n            poly_total += 1\n        elif (a_char == 'P' and b_char == 'R') or \\\n             (a_char == 'R' and b_char == 'P'):\n            poly_total += 1\n            \n    print(f\"{nike_total} {poly_total}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths is computed to determine the cycle length.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each position in the cycle, the code checks the outcome of the round between the corresponding moves from `A` and `B`. It counts the losses for each player during this cycle.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The total losses for each player are calculated by multiplying the cycle losses by the number of full cycles (`n // L`) and then simulating the remaining rounds (`n % L`) to adjust the counts.\n5. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
