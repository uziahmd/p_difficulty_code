    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Since the string is short, we can try to check all substring lengths from the maximum possible (which is n//2) down to 1.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the longest substring that appears at least twice (and occurrences can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. If the string length is less than 2, then no substring of length>=1 can appear twice? Actually, if length=1, then we can have two same adjacent? But wait: \n    Example: \"aaa\" has substrings of length 1: 'a' appears multiple times. So the answer for \"aaa\" is 1? But wait, the problem says \"at least twice\". \n    However, note that the substring must appear at least twice. In \"aaa\", the substring 'a' appears three times, so that's valid.\n\n 3. We can consider: \n    Let n = len(s)\n    We want the maximum L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n 4. We can iterate over possible lengths from n//2 down to 1 (or even from n down to 1, but note: the maximum length of a substring that repeats at least twice cannot be more than n//2? \n    Actually, if we have a substring of length L, then we need two non-overlapping? But the problem says they can overlap. So actually, we can have a substring that appears twice and they can share some characters.\n\n    However, note: the entire string might be repeated only once. The maximum length of a substring that appears twice (allowing overlapping) is limited by the fact that we need two occurrences. \n    But the maximum length we can get is floor(n/2) in the case of a string of all same character? Actually, for \"aaa\": \n        n=3, floor(3/2)=1 -> which is correct (because the substring 'a' of length 1 appears multiple times). \n        But wait, what about a substring of length 2? For \"aaa\", the substring \"aa\" appears twice (from index0 to1 and index1 to2). So the answer for \"aaa\" should be 2.\n\n    Actually, the problem says: the substring must appear at least twice. In \"aaa\", \"aa\" appears twice (overlapping). So the answer for \"aaa\" is 2.\n\n    However, the sample input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] gives output ['0','3','2'].\n\n    Let me break down the samples:\n        'abcd': no substring appears twice -> output 0.\n        'ababa': the substring 'aba' appears twice (starting at index0 and index2) and also 'bab' appears twice? Actually, let's see:\n            'ababa'\n            substrings of length 3: \n                'aba' (0:3) and 'aba' (2:5) -> yes, so length 3 is valid.\n            What about length 4? \n                'abab' and 'baba' -> no repetition. \n            So the answer is 3.\n\n        'zzz': \n            substrings of length 1: 'z' appears multiple times -> valid, but we are looking for the longest.\n            length 2: 'zz' appears twice (at index0 and index1) -> so the answer is 2.\n\n    So we need to find the maximum L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice (allowing overlaps).\n\n 5. Approach:\n    We can iterate L from min(n, ...) but note: the maximum L we can have is n (if the whole string repeats twice, but that would require the string to appear twice, which isn't the case unless n==0) but actually, we don't need two full copies. \n    However, the condition for a substring of length L to appear twice: we need two starting indices i and j (i < j) such that s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L]. \n\n    We can do:\n        Let n = len(s)\n        We'll try L from floor(n/2) down to 1? Actually, the maximum L we can have is n//2 + something? \n        Actually, the maximum L is n-1? No, because if we take L = n, then we have one occurrence (the whole string) and we need two. So the maximum L must be <= n-1.\n\n        But wait, consider \"aaaa\": \n            n=4, then L=4: the whole string \"aaaa\" appears only once? Actually, we are allowed to have two occurrences. The whole string can't be found twice as a contiguous substring without exceeding the string. \n            However, note that the two occurrences can be overlapping. But the whole string itself cannot be found twice because the first occurrence ends at the last character and the next occurrence would require starting at index1, but then the substring of length 4 starting at index1 would be \"aaa\" (if the string is \"aaaa\")? Actually, the substring of length 4 at index1 would be \"aaa\" (if we take 4 from index1 in a string of length4, it goes from index1 to index4, which is out of bounds). \n\n        Actually, the two occurrences must be within the string. The substring of length L must start at index i and j, and both must be such that i+L <= n and j+L <= n.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum L we can have is n (but then we need two non-overlapping? Actually, we don't require non-overlapping, but the two occurrences must fit in the string. The condition is: we need two starting indices i and j (with j >= i+1) such that j+L <= n.\n\n        So the maximum L for which there are two occurrences is at most n-1. But wait, what if the string is \"abcabc\"? \n            Then we have two occurrences of \"abc\" (length 3). The entire string is 6, so two occurrences of length 3.\n\n        Actually, the maximum L we can consider is from 1 up to n-1 (because two occurrences require at least 2*L <= n + (n-1)? Not exactly. The condition is: the second occurrence must start at an index <= n-L. So we require two starting indices i and j (with i<j) and j <= n-L. Therefore, the maximum L we can have is when we have two starting indices with the last starting index being at most n-L. \n\n        But note: the two occurrences can be anywhere, so the minimal requirement is that the substring of length L appears at least twice, meaning there are two indices i and j (i<j) such that j <= n-L.\n\n        Since we are going from high to low, we can:\n\n        Option 1: iterate L from n-1 down to 1, and check if there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n        How to check for a fixed L?\n            We can use a set or a dictionary to record all substrings of length L and their starting index? Actually, we don't need the starting index, we just need to know if any substring of length L appears at least twice.\n\n        But note: we can have two different starting indices. We can store the substring and count how many times it appears.\n\n        However, we don't need the exact count, just if any substring of length L appears at least twice.\n\n        Steps for fixed L:\n            Create an empty dictionary (or set) to record the substrings we've seen.\n            For i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substring = s[i:i+L]\n                if substring is already in the dictionary, then we have found at least two occurrences -> return L as the answer.\n                Otherwise, add it to the dictionary.\n\n            If we don't find any duplicate for this L, then we decrease L and repeat.\n\n        But note: we are going from large L to small, so the first L we find will be the maximum.\n\n        However, the problem: we must output 0 if no substring appears twice. \n\n        So algorithm:\n\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string length is 0, return 0. But the problem says non-empty.\n\n        We consider L from min(n, ???) down to 1. Actually, the maximum L we can have is n-1 (because two occurrences: the first occurrence starts at 0 and the second occurrence must start at least 1, so the substring of length L must end at index L-1 and then the second occurrence must start at index j (>=1) and end at j+L-1, so j+L-1 <= n-1 -> j <= n-L. We require at least two distinct starting indices, so the condition for a fixed L is that there are at least two indices i and j (with i<j) such that the substring is the same.\n\n        However, note: the two occurrences don't have to be consecutive. But the above method (iterating and checking duplicates) is standard.\n\n        But note: the entire string is too long to have two occurrences (unless L is 0). So we start from L = min_possible_max = n-1 down to 1.\n\n        However, what if the string is \"aabb\", then the maximum L is 1? Actually, no: \n            \"aabb\": \n                L=4: entire string, only one occurrence.\n                L=3: substrings: \"aab\", \"abb\" -> no duplicates.\n                L=2: substrings: \"aa\", \"ab\", \"bb\" -> \"aa\" appears once, \"ab\" appears once, \"bb\" appears once -> no duplicates.\n                L=1: substrings: \"a\",\"a\",\"b\",\"b\" -> so \"a\" appears twice and \"b\" appears twice -> so the answer is 1.\n\n        So we must consider that the answer is 1 for \"aabb\".\n\n        Therefore, we can iterate L from n-1 down to 1, and if we find a duplicate for that L, we output L and break. \n        If we don't find any duplicate for any L from n-1 down to 1, then output 0.\n\n        But wait: what if the string is \"a\"? Then n=1, we iterate from 0 down to 1? Actually, we start from L = n-1 = 0. Then we check L=0: substring of length 0 is the empty string. But the problem says the substring must appear at least twice. The empty string appears everywhere? Actually, the problem says the string is non-empty, but we are not sure about the empty substring. The problem says \"longest substring\", and typically substring means contiguous non-empty? \n\n        Let me read the problem: It says \"substring\", and in programming problems, substring usually includes contiguous non-empty? But note: the example outputs: for 'abcd' output 0, meaning no non-empty substring appears twice? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify non-empty, but the examples: \n            Input: 'abcd' -> output 0.\n            Input: 'ababa' -> output 3.\n            Input: 'zzz' -> output 2.\n\n        And note: if we allow empty substring, then the empty substring appears infinitely many times (every gap) so the answer would be the entire length? That doesn't match.\n\n        The problem says: the string is non-empty and consists of lower-case Latin letters.\n\n        Typically, substring problems here consider contiguous non-empty substrings. But note: the problem does not explicitly say non-empty. However, the example outputs suggest that the answer is 0 for 'abcd'. If we considered the empty substring, then we would have a duplicate for every L (because the empty substring is always there) and the maximum L would be the entire string? \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice\". The empty substring is a substring, but it is met everywhere (so infinitely many times). Then the answer for any string would be the entire string? But that contradicts the example.\n\n        Therefore, we assume that the substring must be non-empty. But note: the problem does not say non-empty. However, in competitive programming, sometimes the empty substring is excluded by the problem context.\n\n        Let me check the problem statement: \"You're given a string of lower-case Latin letters.\" and \"longest substring\". Typically, substring implies contiguous, and sometimes empty substring is considered, but in this problem, since the examples do not include empty substring (they output 0 for 'abcd'), and the problem says \"at least twice\", if empty substring were allowed, then we would never output 0.\n\n        Therefore, we must assume that we are only considering non-empty substrings.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"substring\", and in many definitions, substring can include empty. But the problem's example output for 'abcd' is 0, which would not happen if we included empty substring. So we are to consider non-empty.\n\n        But wait: the problem does not specify non-empty. However, the expected outputs are given.\n\n        Let's reexamine: \n            Sample Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> Output: ['0','3','2']\n\n        We are to output the length. So if we consider non-empty, then for 'abcd' we output 0, meaning no non-empty substring appears twice.\n\n        So our algorithm:\n\n        n = len(s)\n        # If n==0: output 0 (but problem says non-empty)\n\n        Let max_dup = 0\n\n        We iterate L from min(n, ?) down to 1? Actually, we can iterate L from n-1 down to 1.\n\n        However, note: the maximum L we can have is n-1 (as explained) because two occurrences must be contained in the string. But wait: \n            Consider \"aaaa\": n=4, then L=3: \n                substrings: \n                    s[0:3] = \"aaa\"\n                    s[1:4] = \"aaa\"\n                so duplicate found, then answer is 3.\n\n            But wait, the entire string is \"aaaa\", and we found a substring of length 3 that appears twice.\n\n            Now, what if we have a string of length 5: \"abcde\", then the maximum L we can have is 4? \n                L=4: substrings: \"abcd\", \"bcde\" -> no duplicate -> then check L=3: \"abc\", \"bcd\", \"cde\" -> no duplicate -> then L=2, etc.\n\n        But note: the condition for two occurrences: the second occurrence must start at an index <= n-L. So for L=3 in \"abcde\", we have two substrings: \"abc\" and \"bcd\" and \"cde\", none repeated.\n\n        So we can iterate L from n-1 down to 1, and for each L, we check all contiguous substrings of length L.\n\n        However, we can optimize by breaking early.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n        # If n==0, then output 0, but the problem says non-empty.\n\n        # We are going to check for L from n-1 down to 1.\n        # But note: the maximum L we can have is n-1, but what if the string is \"aaa\", then n=3, and we check L=2: \n        #   substrings: s[0:2]=\"aa\", s[1:3]=\"aa\" -> duplicate -> so answer 2.\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            # We'll use a dictionary to count the substrings of length L.\n            seen = {}\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    # We have found a duplicate\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)  # or break and then output L, but we are going to break the loop and then output after the loop?\n                    # Alternatively, we can break and then return L.\n                    # But note: we are iterating from largest to smallest, so the first duplicate we find is the maximum L.\n                    # But wait, we must check all L until we find one? Actually, we are iterating from high to low, so the first duplicate we find is the maximum.\n                    # So we break and output L.\n                    # However, we can break the inner loop and then break the outer loop.\n\n                else:\n                    seen[substr] = 1\n\n        # If we didn't find any duplicate for any L, then output 0.\n        print(0)\n\n        But wait, we are using exit(0) which terminates the program. Maybe better to structure without exit.\n\n        Revised:\n\n        n = len(s)\n        # Check from L = n-1 down to 1\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = {}\n            duplicate_found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)   # or break out and then return, but we are in a script.\n\n            # If we finish the inner loop without duplicate, continue to next L (smaller)\n\n        print(0)\n\n        But wait, what if we have two different substrings of the same length that are duplicates? Actually, we are storing each substring and if we see the same substring again, we break.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"can be met in the string at least twice\". This method checks for duplicates, so if a substring appears more than twice, we still break at the second occurrence.\n\n        But is this efficient? The maximum length is 100, and the maximum L is 99, and the inner loop for L=99: only 2 substrings (if n=100, then 100-99+1=2). So worst-case, we do:\n\n        For L from 99 down to 1:\n            We do (n - L + 1) iterations, and each substring extraction of length L.\n\n        The total work: \n            Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n - L + 1) * L\n\n        But note: we are going from L=n-1 down to 1, but the inner loop runs (n-L+1) times and for each we extract a substring of length L (which is O(L)).\n\n        The total operations: \n            For each L, the inner loop does (n-L+1)*L operations (each operation being copying L characters? or using hashing which is O(L))\n\n        Since n<=100, the worst-case L is 99, and the inner loop for L=99: 2 * 99 = 198 operations (for the substring extraction). Then for L=98: 3*98=294, and so on.\n\n        The total number of operations is bounded by about O(n^3) (since the sum_{L=1}^{n} (n-L+1)*L is roughly O(n^3)). With n=100, the maximum n^3 is 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait, we are iterating from L=n-1 down to 1, and for each L we do (n-L+1) * (cost of substring and dictionary lookup). The dictionary lookup is O(L) per substring (if we use a rolling hash we could do better, but n is only 100 so it's okay).\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a set and avoid the dictionary by just storing the substring and checking membership. But the set insertion and lookup is O(L) per substring.\n\n        However, note: we are only storing distinct substrings of length L. The number of distinct substrings of length L is at most n-L+1, so the set size is at most n-L+1.\n\n        Another idea: we can break early if we find a duplicate. But worst-case we still have to check all substrings for a given L until we find a duplicate.\n\n        Since the problem size is small (n<=100), we can do this.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: 'abcd' (n=4)\n            L from 3 down to 1:\n                L=3: substrings: 'abc','bcd' -> no duplicate -> next L=2: 'ab','bc','cd' -> no duplicate -> L=1: 'a','b','c','d' -> no duplicate -> output 0.\n\n        Example 2: 'ababa' (n=5)\n            L=4: substrings: 'abab','baba' -> no duplicate.\n            L=3: substrings: 'aba','bab','aba' -> wait, we have two 'aba'? \n                Actually, the substrings of length 3 in 'ababa':\n                    index0: 'aba'\n                    index1: 'bab'\n                    index2: 'aba'\n                So we see 'aba' at index0 and index2. So we break and output 3.\n\n        Example 3: 'zzz' (n=3)\n            L=2: substrings: 'zz','zz' -> duplicate, output 2.\n\n        But wait, in 'zzz' for L=2, the two substrings are:\n            s[0:2] = 'zz'\n            s[1:3] = 'zz'\n\n        Correct.\n\n        However, what if the duplicate occurs at the same starting index? Actually, we are iterating and storing each substring. The same substring appearing consecutively is stored and then the second time we see it we break.\n\n        But note: the two occurrences must be distinct? The problem says \"at least twice\", meaning two distinct occurrences? The problem allows overlapping, so the same substring can be taken from different starting indices.\n\n        Our method uses the substring content and the starting index is irrelevant. So if the same substring appears again, we break.\n\n        One more example: \"aabb\" (n=4)\n            L=3: 'aab','abb' -> no duplicate.\n            L=2: 'aa','ab','bb' -> no duplicate (all distinct).\n            L=1: 'a','a','b','b' -> \n                We start with 'a': not seen -> add.\n                Then 'a': seen -> duplicate! -> output 1.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note: we are breaking at the first duplicate we find for a given L. But what if for a given L, there are multiple duplicates? We break at the first duplicate we encounter. But that's okay because we are only looking for one duplicate to confirm that the substring appears at least twice.\n\n        But note: we are iterating from the highest L to the lowest. We break at the first L (largest) for which we find a duplicate.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Code:\n\n        We read the input from stdin.\n\n        Example: if the input is given as a list of strings? Actually, the problem says \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n        So we do:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        Then run the above algorithm.\n\n        However, note: the example input format is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] but that's just showing examples. Actually, the input is one string per test case.\n\n        But the problem says: \n            Input: The first input line contains the string.\n\n        So we read one string.\n\n        But wait: what if there are multiple test cases? The problem statement does not specify multiple test cases. It says \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n        So we assume one string per run.\n\n        However, the example input is given as a list, but that's just for illustration.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        Edge: if the string is empty? The problem says non-empty, so skip.\n\n        Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # If the string length is 1, then the maximum L we can check is 0 (since we go from n-1=0 down to 1 -> but range(n-1,0,-1) for n=1: range(0,0,-1) -> empty. Then we output 0.\n\n        But wait, if the string is \"a\" (length 1): \n            There is no substring of length>=1 that appears twice. So output 0.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, if the string is \"aa\" (n=2): \n            L=1: substrings: 'a','a' -> duplicate, so output 1.\n\n        But wait, the entire string is \"aa\", and we can also have a substring of length 2? \n            For L=2: substring \"aa\" appears only once (the whole string). But wait, we are iterating from L=n-1=1 down to 1. So we don't check L=2.\n\n        Why did we set the range from n-1 down to 1? Because two occurrences of a substring of length L must fit in the string: the second occurrence must start at an index <= n-L. For L=2, the second occurrence would require starting at index>=1 and then the substring would be from index1 to index2 (which is beyond the string of length2). So indeed, for L=2, there is only one occurrence.\n\n        So the algorithm is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the two occurrences can overlap. But the condition for two occurrences is that the substring appears at least twice. For L=2 in \"aa\", we have two occurrences: \n            Occurrence1: [0:2] -> \"aa\"\n            Occurrence2: [1:3] -> but the string has only indices 0 to 1, so [1:3] is invalid.\n\n        Actually, the substring of length 2 must start at index0 and index1. But index1 is the second character, and the substring from index1 of length2 would require two characters: index1 and index2 -> but index2 doesn't exist. So only one occurrence.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum L for \"aa\" is 1.\n\n        But wait, what if the string is \"aaa\" (n=3): \n            For L=2: \n                substring at index0: \"aa\"\n                substring at index1: \"aa\"\n                substring at index2: \"a\" (but we don't consider because L=2, so we stop at index1 for L=2: actually, the substring of length2 in \"aaa\" are:\n                    index0: \"aa\"\n                    index1: \"aa\"\n                So we have two occurrences. So the answer is 2.\n\n        So the algorithm for \"aa\" (n=2) gives 1, and for \"aaa\" (n=3) gives 2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # We'll iterate L from n-1 down to 1.\n        # But note: the maximum L we can have is n-1, because two occurrences require that the second occurrence starts at an index <= n-L, and the first occurrence at index0, so the second occurrence must start at index>=1, then we require n-L >= 1 -> L <= n-1.\n\n        # So we iterate L from n-1 down to 1.\n\n        # Special case: if n==0, but the problem says non-empty.\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                # Extract substring from i to i+L\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                else:\n                    seen.add(substr)\n\n        print(0)\n\n        However, note: we are using set and the substring extraction. But the substring extraction for each i is O(L). The total operations for a fixed L is O(n * L). \n\n        Since n<=100, and L from 1 to 99, the worst-case is when L is around 50, then we do 100*50 = 5000 operations for that L. And we do for all L from 99 down to 1. The total operations would be the sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L.\n\n        We can compute the worst-case n=100: \n            Total operations = sum_{L=1}^{99} (100-L+1)*L = sum_{L=1}^{99} (101-L)*L\n\n        But note: we break early if we find a duplicate. So in the best-case scenario, we break at the first L (which is the largest) and we only do the inner loop for the first few L. But worst-case (no duplicate) we do all L from 99 down to 1.\n\n        The total operations without duplicate is:\n\n            For L from 99 down to 1: (100-L+1)*L = (101-L)*L\n\n            = 101*L - L^2\n\n            Then total = sum_{L=1}^{99} (101*L - L^2)\n\n            = 101 * sum_{L=1}^{99} L - sum_{L=1}^{99} L^2\n\n            = 101 * (99*100//2) - (99*100*199//6)\n\n            = 101 * 4950 - (328350)\n\n            = 499950 - 328350 = 171600\n\n        Which is acceptable for a computer.\n\n        But wait, we are doing substring extraction for each i. Each substring extraction is O(L). So the inner loop for a fixed L does (n-L+1) * (cost of substring extraction) which is (n-L+1)*L.\n\n        So the total operations (in terms of character comparisons) is about 171600 * (average L)? Actually, no: the substring extraction for a given (i,L) is O(L). So the total number of character comparisons is the sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1) * L * (each substring extraction of length L is L characters, and we do (n-L+1) times) -> which is the same as the above calculation: 171600.\n\n        Actually, no: the above calculation was the number of substrings (each substring is of length L). But in the set insertion and lookup, we are storing the entire substring, so we do L operations for each substring.\n\n        So the total operations is the sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1) * L * (some constant factor for creating the substring and hashing it).\n\n        But note: the set operations (insertion and lookup) are O(L) per substring, so the total operations is O( sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1)*L^2 ).\n\n        Wait, that's different. \n\n        Actually, for a fixed L, we are doing (n-L+1) substrings, each of length L, and for each substring we do:\n\n            - Extract the substring: O(L)\n            - Check in set: O(L) (because the hash function for a string of length L is O(L))\n            - Insertion: O(L)\n\n        So for each substring, we do O(L) work, and there are (n-L+1) substrings. So for a fixed L, the work is O((n-L+1)*L^2).\n\n        Then total work is sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1)*L^2.\n\n        For n=100, the maximum L is 99, and the term (n-L+1)*L^2 for L=99 is (100-99+1)=2 * 99^2 = 2*9801 = 19602.\n\n        Then the total work is the sum_{L=1}^{99} (101-L)*L^2.\n\n        This is a cubic polynomial and the sum is about:\n\n        We can approximate by integral from L=1 to 100 of (100-L)*L^2 dL, but we can compute:\n\n        Alternatively, note that the worst-case total operations is about O(n^4) because:\n\n            T(n) = sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L^2.\n\n        For n=100, we can compute:\n\n        Let S = sum_{L=1}^{99} (101-L)*L^2 = 101 * sum_{L=1}^{99} L^2 - sum_{L=1}^{99} L^3.\n\n        sum_{L=1}^{k} L^2 = k(k+1)(2k+1)/6, and sum_{L=1}^{k} L^3 = (k(k+1)/2)^2.\n\n        k=99:\n\n        sum_{L=1}^{99} L^2 = 99*100*199//6 = 328350\n        sum_{L=1}^{99} L^3 = (99*100//2)**2 = (4950)**2 = 24502500\n\n        Then S = 101 * 328350 - 24502500 = 33163350 - 24502500 = 8660850.\n\n        Which is about 8.66 million operations. Each operation is copying a substring of length L (which is O(L)), so the total number of characters processed is about 8.66 million * (average L) which is even worse?\n\n        Wait, no: the above formula for S is the total number of substrings we consider (each substring is of length L, and we do (n-L+1) of them). But the work per substring is O(L) for the set operations (hashing). \n\n        Actually, the total number of characters processed is the sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1) * L * (constant factor for the hash function and the extraction).\n\n        But note: the extraction of the substring is O(L) and the set operations are O(L). So the total work is the sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1) * (c1*L + c2*L) = c * sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1)*L.\n\n        And we already computed that without the square: the sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1)*L = 171600.\n\n        But wait, the set operations are not O(1) but O(L). So the total work is the sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1) * L (for the extraction) plus the same for the set operations? \n\n        Actually, we do two O(L) operations per substring: one for extraction and one for the set operation (lookup and insertion if not found). So total work per substring is O(2*L). \n\n        Then the total operations is 2 * sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1)*L = 2 * 171600 = 343200.\n\n        But wait, the set operation (lookup) is O(L) and the extraction is O(L). So we are processing 343200 characters in total? \n\n        However, note: the extraction for a substring of length L takes L steps, and we do that for each substring. Similarly, the set operation (which is a hash) for a string of length L takes L steps (to compute the hash). \n\n        So the total work is the sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1) * (2*L) = 2 * 171600 = 343200.\n\n        And 343200 is acceptable for a modern computer.\n\n        But wait, in our previous calculation for the set operations we used the formula for the sum of squares? That was incorrect because we were counting the set operations as O(L^2) per substring, but actually the set operation is O(L) per substring, so the total for set operations is the sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1)*L (for the set operations) and similarly for the extraction.\n\n        Therefore, the total number of character comparisons is 343200, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can optimize by using a rolling hash to compute the hash of the substring in O(1) time. But since n is only 100, we can stick with the simple method.\n\n        But wait, the set of substrings for a fixed L might be large? Actually, the set size is at most n-L+1, which is at most 100, so the set operations are efficient.\n\n        I think the above code is acceptable.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example: 'abcd' -> output 0.\n\n        Example: 'ababa' -> output 3.\n\n        Example: 'zzz' -> output 2.\n\n        Example: 'aaa' -> output ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, and the solution must efficiently handle all edge cases, including strings where no such substring exists.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to determine the maximum length of any substring that repeats at least once in the input string. The solution involves checking all possible substrings of decreasing lengths from the longest possible down to 1. The first duplicate found during this check will be the answer since we are checking from the largest to the smallest substring length.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1, we can efficiently find the longest substring that repeats. For each length, we examine all possible substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return the current length as the result.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves nested loops: an outer loop for substring lengths and an inner loop to generate and check substrings of the current length. Using a set allows us to efficiently detect duplicates.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3) due to the nested loops and substring operations, but given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is feasible and efficient enough for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    if n <= 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            seen.add(substr)\n            \n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string length is 1 or less, the output is 0 since no substring of length ≥1 can repeat.\n3. **Substring Length Iteration**: The outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths from the largest (n-1) down to 1.\n4. **Substring Generation and Check**: For each length, the inner loop generates all substrings of that length. Each substring is checked against a set of previously seen substrings. If a duplicate is found, the current length is printed, and the program exits.\n5. **Output Result**: If no duplicates are found for any length, the program outputs 0, indicating no repeating substring was found.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination upon finding the first valid candidate, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
