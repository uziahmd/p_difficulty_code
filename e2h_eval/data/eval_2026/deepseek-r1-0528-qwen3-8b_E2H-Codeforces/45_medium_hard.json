There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament with n players, given a constraint on the grid: two players can play only if the number of games they have played so far differs by at most one.\n\n Observation:\n In a standard knockout tournament (without the constraint), the winner must win log2(n) games (if n is a power of two). However, the constraint allows for a different structure.\n\n Let's denote by f(k) the maximum number of players that can be arranged so that the winner plays exactly k games, under the given constraint.\n\n How does the constraint work?\n - The winner must win all his/her games.\n - After each game, the player gains one more game.\n\n Condition for two players to play: their current game counts must differ by at most one.\n\n We can think of building the tournament as having rounds, but the constraint might allow non-uniform rounds.\n\n Alternatively, note that the entire tournament must form a binary tree (with the winner at the root) and the constraint is that the subtrees (or the depth of nodes) must not vary too much.\n\n Actually, we can model the tournament as a graph where the winner must have a path of wins and the constraint is about the \"generation\" or the round.\n\n However, note the example: \n   n=2 -> 1 game\n   n=3 -> 2 games\n   n=4 -> 2 games\n\n But wait, for n=3: \n   We have 3 players. We cannot have a standard single elimination because that would require 4 players (then we have two semi-finals and a final). But here we have 3 players.\n\n How can we arrange for 3 players?\n   We can have two games first? No, because then two players would be eliminated and the third wins without playing? But then the winner only played one game.\n\n Alternatively, the problem says the winner must win all their games. So the winner must play until the end.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"assuming the rule above is used\". We are allowed to arrange the grid arbitrarily as long as the condition holds.\n\n For n=3:\n   We can have an initial arrangement: \n        Game 1: Player1 vs Player2 -> winner (Player1) now has 1 game.\n        Then, we have two players left: Player1 (with 1 game) and Player3 (0 games). They can play because |1-0| <= 1.\n        Then Player1 wins again.\n\n   So the winner (Player1) plays 2 games.\n\n For n=4:\n   We have two possibilities:\n        Option 1: Standard single elimination: two semifinals and then the final. Then the winner plays 2 games.\n        Option 2: But if we try to let the winner play more than 2 games, we cannot because there are only 4 players and the total games the winner must play is at least the number of rounds, which is 2.\n\n   However, the problem says the answer for n=4 is 2.\n\n For n=10, the answer is 4.\n\n Let's try to derive a pattern:\n\n We note that the winner must play k games. Then, the tournament must have at least k rounds (each game for the winner is a round). But the constraint allows that the other branches might have different numbers of games.\n\n Actually, the tournament can be structured in a way that the winner's opponents are chosen from players that are in the same or adjacent generation.\n\n We can think of the tournament as having rounds, but the rounds are not necessarily full. The condition is that when the winner is about to play his next game, the next opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less (because the winner has one more than the opponent).\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire bracket to be balanced.\n\n Alternate approach: consider that the tournament is built as follows:\n\n Let the winner be fixed. Then, the winner must defeat k players (thus k games). Now, to have k games, we need to account for the fact that each game eliminates one player, and the entire tournament must eliminate n-1 players.\n\n But note: the winner's path has k games, and each game eliminates one player. However, the tournament might have byes and the constraint on the grid.\n\n However, there is a known structure for such tournaments: \n\n We can build the tournament by having two halves: one half that is the main path of the winner and the other half that feeds into the winner.\n\n But note the constraint: the winner must be able to play two players only if the difference in the number of games is at most one.\n\n This constraint is similar to the condition for a complete binary tournament, but also allows incomplete ones. \n\n Another idea: Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then, we can define:\n\n Round 0: 1 player (the winner)\n Round 1: the winner plays one game, so we need one more player. Now the winner has 1 game, and the two remaining players (if any) must have at most 1 game (so they can be in round 0 or round 1) but actually they haven't played any game? \n\n However, the condition is on the number of games already played. \n\n Let me try to build the tournament backwards:\n\n The winner must have k games. Then, the total number of players required is at least the sum of the sizes of the two subtrees (but the subtrees are constrained by the condition).\n\n We can think recursively:\n\n Let F(k) be the minimum number of players needed so that there exists a tournament in which the winner plays k games.\n\n How to form F(k)?\n   The first game: the winner defeats one player (so we use 2 players: the winner and one opponent). Then, the rest of the tournament must have the winner continue and the defeated opponent's branch must be arranged so that the winner can play the next game.\n\n But note: the constraint. The next opponent must have at most (current_winner_games + 1) and at least (current_winner_games - 1). However, the winner has just won one game, so the next opponent must have either 0 or 1 game? Actually, the next opponent must have played a number of games that is either 0 or 1.\n\n However, the entire tournament must have a structure. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n Consider that the tournament can be broken down into two parts: the winner's path and the rest.\n\n But note: the condition is global: every time two players are to play, their current game counts must be within one.\n\n There is a known solution for a similar problem (CodeForces): \"Tennis Championship\" (problem code: ???) but the exact problem statement is similar.\n\n Insight: the tournament can be structured as a sequence of matches, and the winner must face opponents that are available (from the same level or the level below). \n\n Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then, the tournament can be divided into k rounds. In round i (0-indexed), the winner has i games already, and the next opponent must have either i-1 or i games (for i>=1). But initially, when i=0, the opponent can have 0 games.\n\n However, we are building the minimal number of players to achieve k games.\n\n We can consider:\n\n   F(0) = 1   [only the winner, no game]\n   F(1) = 2   [one game: winner and one opponent]\n\n For k=2:\n   The winner must have two games. The second game must be against an opponent that has either 0 or 1 game.\n   But note: the first game was against an opponent that we eliminated. That opponent's entire subtree (if any) must have been played by that opponent. However, we are minimizing the total players.\n\n   To have the second game, we can have two possibilities:\n\n     Possibility 1: The opponent in the second game has 0 games. Then, we need to have that opponent not having played any game, but how did we get to the second game? We eliminated the first opponent, and then we have the original winner and this new opponent. But wait, after the first game, the winner has 1 game and the new opponent (if he hasn't played) must be from a separate branch? Actually, the entire tournament must have:\n\n        First game: winner (0) vs A (0) -> winner advances (now has 1 game), A is eliminated.\n        Then, the next opponent B must have 0 or 1 game. If B has 0, then we have two players (B and the winner) but we also need to account for the fact that the first opponent A had no further matches. So the total players so far: winner, A, B -> 3.\n\n        But then the winner has two games? Actually, we have two games: the first and the second. So with 3 players, the winner can play two games.\n\n     Possibility 2: The opponent in the second game has 1 game. Then, that opponent must have played one game already. How can that happen? The opponent must have defeated someone else. So we need:\n\n        First game: winner (0) vs A (0) -> winner wins, A eliminated. (Now the winner has 1 game)\n        Second game: winner (1) vs B (1) -> winner wins.\n\n        But who did B defeat? B must have played one game. So B must have defeated someone (say C). Therefore, the total players: winner, A, B, C -> 4.\n\n        Then, the minimal number of players for k=2 is min(3,4) = 3? But wait, the condition for the second game: the winner has 1 and B has 1 -> allowed.\n\n        However, the tournament must eliminate all but the winner. We have eliminated A and C. So that is valid.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the entire tournament to be minimal in players for a given k. We are given n, and we want the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n        We are to find the maximum k (number of games for the winner) such that the tournament can be arranged with n players.\n\n        Therefore, we need to compute F(k): the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games.\n\n        Then, we are given n, and we want the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n        Now, what is F(k)?\n\n        Let F(k) be the minimal number of players required so that the winner plays exactly k games.\n\n        How to compute F(k):\n\n        The winner must play k games. Each game requires an opponent. Additionally, each opponent may have come from a subtree that itself forms a tournament (because the opponent must have won some games to reach that point).\n\n        But note: the constraint condition applies to every match. In particular, the winner's opponents must have at most (current_winner_games) ± 1.\n\n        We can break down:\n\n          In the first game, the winner (initially 0 games) plays an opponent with 0 games. Then, the opponent we choose for the j-th game must have a record of either j-1 or j (because the winner has j-1 games before the j-th game, so the opponent must have either j-2, j-1, or j? Actually, note: just before the j-th game, the winner has j-1 games. The opponent must have a number of games g such that |g - (j-1)| <= 1, i.e., g is either j-2, j-1, or j.\n\n        However, the opponent we face in the j-th game must have been built from a subtree that started with the opponent having 0 games (at the beginning) and then the opponent won some games. The minimal way to build an opponent that has g games is to use F(g) players (including the opponent) but wait: the opponent is one of the players, and the entire subtree for that opponent is independent.\n\n        Actually, we can use a recurrence:\n\n          Let F(0) = 1 (the winner alone)\n\n          For the first game (k=1): the winner must have one game. The opponent must have 0 games (because the winner starts with 0, so the opponent must have 0 or 1? Actually, the condition for the first game: winner has 0, so opponent must have 0 or 1. But if the opponent has 1, then that opponent must have already played a game. However, we are building the minimal number of players. It is cheaper to have the opponent with 0 games.\n\n          So for k=1: we need 2 players: the winner and one opponent.\n\n          Now, for k=2: we have two options for the second game's opponent:\n            Option 1: opponent has 0 games -> then we need to have that opponent without having played any game. But then, how did we get to the second game? The first game was against an opponent (say A) that we eliminated. Then we have the winner and a new opponent (B) that hasn't played. But wait, the tournament must account for the entire set of players. The minimal way is to have two opponents: A and B. Then the total players is 3 (winner, A, B). However, note that the first opponent A must have been defeated without playing any game (so we don't need to account for anything beyond that). Then the second opponent B is a fresh one.\n\n            Option 2: opponent has 1 game -> then that opponent must have won one game. So we need the opponent to have a subtree of F(1) players (which is 2) including himself. Then the total players is: winner (1) + the first opponent (A, 1 player) + the subtree of the second opponent (F(1)=2, which includes the opponent and one more). So total = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal number of players for k=2 is min(3,4) = 3.\n\n        Similarly, for k=3:\n\n          The third game: the winner has 2 games, so the opponent must have 1, 2, or 3 games.\n\n          Option 1: opponent has 1 game -> then the opponent must have won one game. The minimal players for that opponent is F(1)=2. Then the entire tournament: \n             Winner's side: \n                 Game0: winner (0) vs ? (we don't care about the opponent's prior games, but we know the opponent has 1 game from his own path) -> but wait, we need to account for the entire structure.\n\n          Actually, we can define:\n\n            Let F(k) = 1 + F(k-1) + F(k-2)\n\n          Why?\n            In the k-th game (the k-th win for the winner), the opponent must have either k-2, k-1, or k games.\n\n          But note: we are trying to minimize the total players. The minimal way is to use the smallest possible subtree for the opponent.\n\n          The condition: the opponent must have at least (k-2) games (if we take the minimal allowed, which is k-2) or we can take k-1 or k. However, the minimal is k-2.\n\n          But wait, the opponent must have a record that is either k-2, k-1, or k. The minimal number of players needed for an opponent with m games is F(m). Then, to minimize the total, we take the smallest m (which is k-2) if allowed.\n\n          However, the constraint says the opponent must have a record that is either k-2, k-1, or k. And we are free to arrange the tournament arbitrarily. So we can choose the opponent's record to be k-2.\n\n          Then, the recurrence becomes:\n\n            F(0) = 1\n            F(1) = 2\n            For k>=2: F(k) = 1 + F(k-1) + F(k-2)\n\n          Let's check:\n\n            k=2: F(2) = 1 + F(1) + F(0) = 1+2+1 = 4. But wait, we found that k=2 can be achieved with 3 players.\n\n          What went wrong? The above recurrence is for the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games, but note that the entire tournament includes the winner and all the opponents and their supporting players.\n\n          However, in our breakdown for k=2, we had two possibilities:\n\n            Option1: 3 players (using an opponent with 0 games for the second match) -> that opponent didn't have to have a full subtree because he only played one game (the one that got him to the second match). But wait, in the second match, the opponent has 0 games. How did he get to have 0 games? He hasn't played any game. But then, how do we account for the first opponent? \n\n          Actually, we need to think of the entire set of players that are eliminated. The winner's opponents and their entire subtrees (the players that lost to the opponent) are part of the tournament.\n\n          The recurrence should account for:\n\n            In the k-th game, the winner faces an opponent that has m games (m = k-2, k-1, or k). Then, the entire subtree of that opponent requires F(m) players (the opponent plus his defeated path). But note: the opponent must have reached his m games by winning m games. Then, the total number of players is:\n\n            F(k) = 1 (the winner) + [the players in the opponent's subtree] + [the players eliminated in the previous rounds of the winner's matches?]\n\n          Actually, the winner's matches: the first k-1 matches have produced k-1 defeated opponents, each of which must have their own subtrees.\n\n          However, the condition allows the winner to have opponents from different levels. The minimal way is to use the smallest subtrees for each opponent.\n\n          But note: the condition also links the levels. The winner's matches must be scheduled such that the opponent in the j-th match has a record of j-1 or j (or even j-2? Actually, the condition is that the absolute difference is at most one. So for the j-th match, the winner has j-1 games, so the opponent must have j-2, j-1, or j.\n\n          However, we are building the minimal tournament. We want to minimize the total players. So for the j-th match, we choose the smallest record (j-2) if j>=2, but for j=1 we must choose 0 or 1 (and we choose 0 to minimize).\n\n          Therefore, we can define:\n\n            F(0) = 1   [the winner only]\n            F(1) = 2   [winner and one opponent with 0 games]\n\n            For k>=2, the j-th opponent (for j from 1 to k) must have a record of max(0, j-2) (because we choose the minimal allowed record, which is j-2, but j-2 might be negative so we use 0? Actually, the minimal record allowed is j-2, but j-2 could be negative -> so we use 0 for j=1 and j=2). \n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            Let F(k) = 1 + F(k-1) + F(k-2)\n\n          But then we get:\n\n            k=0: 1\n            k=1: 2\n            k=2: 1 + F(1) + F(0) = 1+2+1 = 4\n            k=3: 1 + F(2) + F(1) = 1+4+2 = 7\n            k=4: 1 + F(3)+F(2)=1+7+4=12\n\n          Then, we are to find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n          However, the sample: \n            n=2 -> k=1 (since F(1)=2<=2, F(2)=4>2 -> so k=1) -> correct.\n            n=3 -> k=1? but we need k=2 for n=3, but F(2)=4>3 -> then we cannot use k=2? \n\n          But wait, we found that for k=2, we can use 3 players (by using an opponent with 0 games for the second match). \n\n          Why is F(2)=4 then? Because the recurrence above assumed that the second opponent must have record 0 (which is the minimal) and then the subtree for that opponent (with 0 games) is just the opponent? But wait, the recurrence F(m) gives the minimal number of players for an opponent that has m games. \n\n          Actually, the recurrence should be defined differently.\n\n          Let me redefine:\n\n          The tournament has three parts:\n\n            Part A: the winner and his k games (each game eliminates one opponent, and each opponent has his own subtree).\n            Part B: the entire set of players that are eliminated by the winner's opponents.\n\n          However, the condition allows the opponent to have a record that is up to one less than the winner's current record. \n\n          We can use a greedy construction:\n\n          We want to minimize the total number of players for k games.\n\n          The winner's path: k games, so we need k opponents.\n\n          But the catch: the opponents themselves must have won some games (to get to the point of playing the winner) and the condition requires that the difference in the number of games is at most one.\n\n          The minimal way is to have the opponents in the winner's path as weak as possible (i.e., having as few wins as possible). \n\n          The first opponent (facing the winner at the first game) must have 0 games (minimal). Then, the second opponent must have either 0 or 1 game. But if we use an opponent with 0 games for the second game, then we are effectively giving the winner two consecutive opponents without them having any wins. However, note that the first opponent (with 0 games) is eliminated without playing any game, so we don't need to account for any subtree for the first opponent. Then the second opponent (with 0 games) is also eliminated without playing any game. Then the total players is the winner and the two opponents -> 3 for k=2.\n\n          But then, the recurrence is not linear. \n\n          Actually, we can use the following:\n\n          Let F(k) be the minimal number of players needed so that the winner plays k games.\n\n          Then, the k opponents (each being defeated by the winner) must be built from subtrees that are independent. However, the condition imposes that the j-th opponent must have a record (number of wins) that is either j-2, j-1, or j. But we want to minimize the total players, so we choose the smallest record for the j-th opponent, which is max(0, j-2).\n\n          Then, the j-th opponent requires F(max(0, j-2)) players (the entire subtree for that opponent). However, wait: the j-th opponent is a player that has max(0, j-2) wins, and the entire subtree for that opponent is F(max(0, j-2)) (which includes the opponent and all the players he eliminated). \n\n          But note: the j-th opponent is one of the players, and the subtree for that opponent is independent. \n\n          However, the winner is one player, and we have k opponents, and each opponent comes with a subtree of size F(max(0, j-2)).\n\n          But wait, the first opponent (j=1) must have 0 wins -> subtree of F(0)=1 (just the opponent).\n          The second opponent (j=2) must have 0 wins -> subtree of F(0)=1.\n          The third opponent (j=3) must have 1 win (since j-2=1) -> subtree of F(1)=2.\n\n          Then, the total players is: 1 (winner) + F(0) (for the first opponent) + F(0) (for the second) + F(1) (for the third) + ... ?\n\n          But that is not matching: for k=1: 1 + F(0) = 1+1=2 -> correct.\n          For k=2: 1 + F(0) + F(0) = 1+1+1=3 -> correct.\n          For k=3: 1 + F(0) + F(0) + F(1) = 1+1+1+2 = 5.\n\n          Then, the recurrence is:\n\n            F(0) = 1\n            F(1) = 2\n\n            For k>=2, the minimal total players for the winner to have k games is:\n\n                F(k) = 1 + F(0) + F(1) + ... + F(k-2)   ?\n\n          Wait, no: the j-th opponent (for j from 1 to k) must have record max(0, j-2). Then, the total players is:\n\n                F(k) = 1 + sum_{j=1}^{k} F(max(0, j-2))\n\n          But note: the first opponent (j=1) uses F(0)=1.\n          The second opponent (j=2) uses F(0)=1.\n          The third opponent (j=3) uses F(1)=2.\n          The fourth opponent (j=4) uses F(2)=? \n\n          But we haven't defined F(2) for the opponent's record. Actually, we need to define F(m) for m (the record) independently.\n\n          Alternatively, note that the entire tournament can be built by having:\n\n            Let T(k) be the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games.\n\n            Then, the winner must have k wins. The last win (the k-th) is against an opponent that has either k-2, k-1, or k wins. To minimize, we choose k-2 wins (if k>=2). Then, the opponent with k-2 wins must have a subtree of T(k-2) players. But wait, the entire tournament must include:\n\n              - The winner (1)\n              - The k-1 previous opponents (each with their own subtrees) and the last opponent (with T(k-2) players)\n\n            However, the previous opponents (the ones in the first k-1 games) must have been built from records that are increasing appropriately.\n\n          Actually, there is a known recurrence for the minimal number of players in such a tournament:\n\n            T(0) = 1\n            T(1) = 2\n            T(k) = T(k-1) + T(k-2)\n\n          But wait, that is the Fibonacci recurrence. Then:\n\n            T(0)=1, T(1)=2, T(2)=T(1)+T(0)=3, T(3)=T(2)+T(1)=3+2=5, T(4)=5+3=8, T(5)=8+5=13.\n\n          Then, the minimal number of players for k games is the k-th Fibonacci number (starting from T0=1, T1=2) but shifted.\n\n          Check with examples:\n\n            n=2: T(1)=2 -> k=1, and 2<=2 -> so answer=1. Correct.\n\n            n=3: T(1)=2<=3, T(2)=3<=3 -> so k=2. Then the answer is 2. Correct.\n\n            n=4: T(1)=2<=4, T(2)=3<=4, T(3)=5>4 -> so k=2. Answer=2. Correct.\n\n            n=10: T(0)=1, T(1)=2, T(2)=3, T(3)=5, T(4)=8, T(5)=13 -> so k=5? But the expected answer is 4 (meaning the winner plays 4 games). \n\n          Wait, the problem: the output is the number of games the winner plays. In our T(k) we defined T(k) as the minimal number of players for the winner to play k games. Then for n=10, we need the maximum k such that T(k) <= 10.\n\n          T(0)=1, T(1)=2, T(2)=3, T(3)=5, T(4)=8, T(5)=13 -> so k=4 because T(4)=8<=10 and T(5)=13>10. Then the answer is 4. Correct.\n\n          So the recurrence is:\n\n            T(0) = 1\n            T(1) = 2\n            T(k) = T(k-1) + T(k-2)   for k>=2.\n\n          Then, we are given n, and we want the maximum k such that T(k) <= n.\n\n          Note: k is the number of games (which is also the number of wins). The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Precompute T(0), T(1), T(2), ... until T(k) exceeds n (n up to 10^18). Then the answer is k-1? \n\n          But note: T(k) is defined for k games. We want the maximum k such that T(k) <= n.\n\n          Example: n=2 -> k=1 (because T(1)=2<=2, T(2)=3>2 -> so k=1). \n          n=3 -> k=2 (T(2)=3<=3, T(3)=5>3 -> k=2).\n          n=4 -> k=2 (T(2)=3<=4, T(3)=5>4 -> k=2).\n          n=10-> k=4 (T(4)=8<=10, T(5)=13>10 -> k=4).\n\n          However, note: the example input ['2','3','4','10'] gives output ['1','2','2','4'].\n\n          Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            Let T[0] = 1\n            T[1] = 2\n            Then, for i from 2 upwards, T[i] = T[i-1] + T[i-2]\n\n            Then, we start from k=0 and go up until T[k] <= n, then the answer is k.\n\n          But wait, the k we are storing is the number of games. So we want the maximum k such that T[k] <= n.\n\n          However, note: k=0 corresponds to 0 games, but the tournament must have at least one game if n>=2? Actually, the minimal tournament with 2 players requires 1 game.\n\n          Our T(0)=1 (for 0 games) and that is the base case. Then T(1)=2 (for 1 game) is the minimal for 2 players.\n\n          Since the problem states that there are n>=2 players, then the winner must play at least 1 game.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Read n (as integer)\n\n            Initialize:\n              a = 1   # T(0)\n              b = 2   # T(1)\n              k = 1   # because T(1)=2 is the first value we have for k=1\n\n            Then, we want the maximum k such that T(k) <= n.\n\n            We can iterate:\n\n              k0 = 0: T(0)=1\n              k1 = 1: T(1)=2\n              k2 = 2: T(2)=3\n              k3 = 3: T(3)=5\n              ...\n\n            But note: we start from k=0 and k=1, then we compute k=2, etc.\n\n            Since n can be up to 10^18, we must use an efficient loop (logarithmic steps? Actually, the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so the maximum k will be around 100, because the Fibonacci numbers grow as O(φ^k), and φ≈1.618, so k ~ 100 gives about 1e20, which is beyond 1e18).\n\n            Algorithm:\n\n              count = 0   # we'll count the number of games (k)\n              a, b = 1, 2\n              if n < 1: then ... but n>=2, so we don't worry.\n              If n==2, then answer=1.\n\n              Actually, we want the maximum k such that T(k) <= n.\n\n              We can do:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  while True:\n                      if k==0: T0=1\n                      elif k==1: T1=2\n                      else: T_k = T_{k-1} + T_{k-2}\n\n              But we don't want to store all T_k, we can iterate k from 0 until T_k > n.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              Let k = 0, and we'll keep the last two values.\n\n              We are going to iterate until the computed T_k is greater than n.\n\n              But note: we want the maximum k such that T_k <= n. Then the answer is k (if we break at k, then the previous k-1 was the last valid).\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              k = 0\n              a, b = 1, 2\n              while b <= n:\n                  a, b = b, a+b\n                  k += 1\n\n              Then, the answer is k? \n\n            Let's test with n=2:\n\n              Start: a=1, b=2, k=0.\n              Condition: 2<=2 -> true.\n              Then update: a=2, b=1+2=3, k=1.\n              Then condition: 3<=2? false -> break.\n              Then answer is k=1? But wait, we updated k to 1 and then broke. But note: we want the last k for which T(k)<=n. \n\n            Actually, we are counting the number of games (k) and we update a and b to the next term. But we start with k=0 (which corresponds to T0=1) and then we enter the loop for k=1 (T1=2). \n\n            We want to know: what is the maximum k such that T(k)<=n?\n\n            We can change the loop to:\n\n              k = 0\n              a, b = 1, 2   # T0 and T1\n              ans = 0        # the maximum k (number of games) we can have\n\n              while b <= n:\n                  ans = 1   # because we are in the state of k=1 (the last one that satisfied the condition) but wait, we are updating k?\n                  a, b = b, a+b\n                  k += 1\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              a, b = 1, 2\n              k = 1   # because we are at k=1 (T1=2) and then we check if b<=n, then we update to k=2, etc.\n\n            Let me restructure:\n\n              Let k = 0, and we have two variables: t0 = 1, t1 = 2 (for k=0 and k=1)\n\n              We want to find the maximum k such that T(k) <= n.\n\n              We can do:\n\n                  k = 0\n                  if n >= 1: then k can be at least 0, but then we check k=1, k=2, etc.\n\n              Actually, we want to iterate k from 0 upwards until T(k) > n, and then the answer is k-1.\n\n            Better:\n\n              k = 0\n              a = 1   # T0\n              b = 2    # T1\n\n              # If n >= T0, then k=0 is a candidate, but we are looking for the maximum k (games) the winner can play, so we want the largest k.\n\n              We can do:\n\n                  while b <= n:\n                      a, b = b, a+b\n                      k += 1\n\n              Then, the last valid k is the one we broke at minus one? \n\n            Actually, let's track:\n\n              Start: a=1, b=2, k=0 (we haven't entered the loop because we check b<=n, but if n>=2 then we enter)\n\n              Step1: condition: 2<=n -> then update: a=2, b=1+2=3, k=1.\n              Then condition: 3<=n -> update: a=3, b=2+3=5, k=2.\n              Then condition: 5<=n -> update: a=5, b=3+5=8, k=3.\n              ...\n\n              When we break, k is the next index (the one that exceeded) but we updated k to the next index. So the last valid k is k-1.\n\n            However, note: the variable k is counting the number of iterations (each iteration we are computing T_{k} and then incrementing k). But initially, we have T0 and T1. Then we start the loop with T1 (b=2) and then we update to T2 (k becomes 1, meaning we have computed T1 and T2). \n\n            Actually, the loop condition checks the current b (which is T_{k}) and then updates to T_{k+1} and increments k to k+1.\n\n            Then, when we break, the current b (which is T_{k}) is the first one that exceeds n, and the last valid is T_{k-1}. But wait, we updated k to the next index and then broke. \n\n            Alternatively, we can break the loop when the next T_{k} (which is stored in b) is greater than n, then the last valid is k-1.\n\n            Actually, let me",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to find the maximum number of games the winner can play under specific constraints. The key observation is that the tournament structure must adhere to the rule that opponents in each game must have a record (number of games played) that differs by at most one from the winner's current record. This resembles a Fibonacci sequence where each term represents the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. Specifically, the recurrence relation is `T(k) = T(k-1) + T(k-2)`, where `T(0) = 1` and `T(1) = 2`. This is because each subsequent game's opponent must have a record that is either one less or the same as the winner's current record, leading to a cumulative player count that grows exponentially.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use an iterative approach to compute the Fibonacci sequence terms until the term exceeds the given number of players `n`. The highest term that does not exceed `n` gives the maximum number of games the winner can play. This approach efficiently handles large values of `n` (up to 10^18) by leveraging the exponential growth property of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(log n) time because the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially. Each iteration computes the next term in the sequence, and the loop terminates once the term exceeds `n`, which happens after approximately log base φ (the golden ratio) of `n` iterations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    a, b = 1, 2\n    k = 1\n    \n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n        \n    print(k - 1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the input value `n`, which represents the number of players.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is 1, the winner plays 0 games, so the output is 0.\n3. **Fibonacci Sequence Calculation**: The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 1 and 2, representing the first two terms of the sequence (`T(0)` and `T(1)`). The loop continues to compute subsequent terms by summing the previous two terms (`a + b`) and updates `a` and `b` accordingly.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop exits when the computed term `b` exceeds `n`. The variable `k` keeps track of the number of games (terms computed), and the result is `k - 1` because the last valid term is one less than the term that exceeded `n`.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of games the winner can play under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
