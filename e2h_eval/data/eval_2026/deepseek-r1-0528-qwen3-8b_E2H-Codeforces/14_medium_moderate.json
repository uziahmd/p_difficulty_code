He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n The function for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n However, the problem asks: for a given m (number of trailing zeros), how many positive integers n have the property that n! has exactly m trailing zeros?\n\n Note: The factorial function is increasing. The number of trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases.\n\n Observation:\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n   Then, for a fixed m, we are looking for all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n But note: the function f(n) is not strictly increasing. For example, \n   f(4) = 0, f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2.\n\n Therefore, the set of n for which f(n)=m might be a contiguous range (if it exists) or empty.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then, we check if there is a range of n's with exactly m zeros.\n\n 2. However, note that the problem says: output k (the number of values) and then the k integers in increasing order.\n\n 3. Important: There might be no n such that f(n) = m. For example, m=1 occurs for n from 5 to 9, but what about m=0? \n    But note: m>=1 per input, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n 4. How does f(n) behave?\n    - It increases only at multiples of 5. Actually, it jumps by the number of factors 5 in that number.\n\n    Example: \n        n=5: f(5)=1\n        n=10: f(10)=2\n        n=25: f(25)=6 (because 25 contributes two factors of 5)\n\n 5. So, the values of n for which f(n) = m must lie in an interval [L, R] (if it exists). But note that the same m might appear for multiple consecutive n's.\n\n 6. However, sometimes there can be gaps. For example, if we want m=0, then n from 1 to 4. But m>=1.\n\n 7. Actually, the problem states that m is at least 1 and up to 100000.\n\n 8. We can do:\n\n    Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Let this be L0.\n\n    Step 2: Now, we know that the trailing zeros first reach m at L0. But we must check if at L0 the trailing zeros is exactly m? Not necessarily.\n\n    Actually, let's define:\n\n        Let L = smallest integer such that f(L) >= m.\n        Then, we can also define R = smallest integer such that f(R) >= m+1.\n\n    Then, the numbers n for which f(n)=m are the integers from L to R-1, provided that f(L) <= m and f(R-1) <= m, and we know that f(L) must be at least m and f(R)>=m+1, so the condition is that the trailing zeros become m+1 at R.\n\n    But wait: what if m=1, then we want n from 5 to 9. \n        f(5)=1 -> so L=5, and then we want the next jump: when does f(n) become 2? At n=10. So R=10.\n\n        Then the numbers are from 5 to 9 (i.e., L to R-1). And the count is 5.\n\n    However, consider m=6. \n        We know that 25! has 6 zeros (since 25//5 + 25//25 + 25//125 = 5+5+0 = 10 -> wait, actually 25! has 6? Let me compute:\n\n        Actually, the formula: \n            floor(25/5) = 5, floor(25/25)=1, total 6. So yes.\n\n        Now, what is the next n where the trailing zeros become 7?\n        We look for the smallest n such that f(n) >= 7.\n\n        n=25: 6, so we go higher.\n\n        n=26: 6 (no change)\n        n=27: 6\n        n=28: 6\n        n=29: 6\n        n=30: 6 (because 30 adds one 5, so 6+1=7? Actually, 30: floor(30/5)=6, floor(30/25)=1 -> 7. So R=30.\n\n        Then the numbers for which f(n)=6 are from 25 to 29. That's 5 numbers.\n\n    But wait, what if m=0? (though m>=1, but for understanding) \n        Then we would look for the smallest n with f(n)>=0 -> that's n=1 (f(1)=0). Then we look for the smallest n with f(n)>=1 -> that's n=5. So the numbers are from 1 to 4. \n\n    However, note: the problem requires positive integers n. And m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0.\n\n 9. Algorithm:\n\n    We need to find:\n        L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n        R = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1\n\n    Then, the numbers are from L to R-1 (if any) and the count is (R - L).\n\n    But note: it is possible that there is no n with f(n)=m? Actually, from the properties of f(n) (which is non-decreasing and jumps by at least 1 at some points, but sometimes more than 1) we can have gaps.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes\".\n\n    Since f(n) is non-decreasing, and jumps by the number of factors of 5 (which is at least 1 at multiples of 5, but sometimes more) then it is possible that m is skipped.\n\n    Example: \n        Consider m=2. \n        We know f(10)=2, so the smallest n with f(n)>=2 is 10. Then the next jump: at 15? \n            f(10)=2, f(15)= floor(15/5)+floor(15/25)=3+0=3 -> so 15 gives 3. \n        Then the numbers for m=2 would be from 10 to 14 (if 10! has 2 zeros, 11!,12!,13!,14! also have 2 zeros because they don't add a factor of 5 until 15).\n\n        But wait: 10! has 2 zeros, 11! has 2 zeros, ... until 14! has 2 zeros? \n            Let's check 14: \n                factors of 5 in 14: floor(14/5)=2, floor(14/25)=0 -> 2. So yes.\n\n        Now, what if m=3? \n            smallest n with f(n)>=3: \n                n=15: f(15)=3 -> so L=15.\n            smallest n with f(n)>=4: \n                n=20: f(20)= floor(20/5)+floor(20/25)=4+0=4 -> R=20.\n            Then the numbers are from 15 to 19 (count=5).\n\n        But wait, what about m=5?\n            smallest n with f(n)>=5: \n                We know: \n                    n=20: 4, so try 21,22,23,24,25.\n                    n=25: f(25)=6 -> so the smallest n with f(n)>=5 is 20? No, because at 20 we have 4, then 21,22,23,24 still 4, then 25 becomes 6.\n\n            So we need to find the smallest n such that f(n)>=5. \n                n=20: 4 -> no.\n                n=21: 4\n                n=22: 4\n                n=23: 4\n                n=24: 4\n                n=25: 6 -> so L=25.\n\n            Then, the smallest n such that f(n)>=6 is 25 (because f(25)=6). Then R=25.\n\n            Then the set of n for which f(n)=5 would be from 25 to 24? That doesn't make sense.\n\n        Correction: Actually, we defined R as the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. For m=5, we require f(n)>=6, so R=25.\n\n        Then the numbers would be from L=25 to R-1=24 -> which is an empty set.\n\n        So for m=5, there is no n such that f(n)=5.\n\n        Why? Because after 24, we have 25 which gives 6 zeros. So the sequence of zeros goes from 4 (at 20-24) to 6 (at 25). Therefore, 5 is skipped.\n\n        This is an important observation: not every m is achieved.\n\n 10. Therefore, the steps are:\n\n      Step 1: Write a function to compute f(n) (the trailing zeros in n!).\n\n      Step 2: Use binary search to find:\n          L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n          R = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1\n\n      Step 3: If f(L) != m, then note that we found the smallest n with at least m zeros, but if f(L) > m, then there is no n with exactly m zeros? Actually, wait: \n\n          We know that f(L) >= m. But if f(L) > m, then we must have jumped over m. Then the set of n for which f(n)=m is empty.\n\n          However, note: our definition of L is the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then we defined R as the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n          Then the numbers from L to R-1 will have f(n) >= m and < m+1, meaning f(n)=m? Not exactly: because f(n) might jump from a value less than m to a value greater than m. \n\n          Actually, the function f(n) is non-decreasing, so if at L we have f(L)=m, then all n from L to R-1 will have f(n)=m? \n\n          But wait: what if we have a jump? For example, if m=5, then L=25 and f(25)=6, so f(L)=6>=5, but then the condition for m=5 is that we require exactly 5. However, at 25 we have 6, so we cannot have any n with 5 zeros.\n\n          Actually, the jump from 24 (which has 4) to 25 (which has 6) skips 5.\n\n      Therefore, we must check: the set of n for which f(n)=m is non-empty only if the smallest n achieving at least m zeros (L) has f(L)=m. Because if f(L)>m, then there is no n with f(n)=m.\n\n      But wait, consider m=4. \n          We want n such that f(n)=4.\n          The smallest n with f(n)>=4 is 20 (since f(20)=4). Then the next jump is to 25 (with 6). So the numbers from 20 to 24 have f(n)=4. \n\n      However, if we have m=5, then L=25 (because 25 is the smallest n with f(n)>=5) and f(25)=6 which is >5, so there is no n with f(n)=5.\n\n      So the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Define a function `trailing_zeros(n)` that computes the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n        Step 2: Use binary search to find L (lower bound for m) and R (lower bound for m+1).\n\n        Step 3: Check if the value at L is exactly m. If not, then there is no n with exactly m zeros. Then we output:\n                k = 0\n\n        Step 4: If f(L)==m, then the numbers n for which f(n)=m are the integers from L to R-1 (because at R, the zeros become at least m+1). Then k = (R - L) and we output the list [L, L+1, ..., R-1].\n\n      However, wait: what if m=0? (but m>=1, so we skip) and what if m is very large?\n\n      But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n      How to compute trailing_zeros(n)? We can do:\n\n          def trailing_zeros(n):\n              count = 0\n              divisor = 5\n              while divisor <= n:\n                  count += n // divisor\n                  divisor *= 5\n\n      But note: n can be very large? We are doing binary search on n. The maximum m is 100000, so what is the maximum n we need?\n\n      We know that the trailing zeros in n! is approximately n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... <= n/4 (geometric series). So to get m=100000, we need n at most around 500000 (because 500000/4 = 125000, which is more than 100000). But actually, the exact formula is:\n\n          n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... = n * (1/5 + 1/25 + 1/125 + ...) < n/4.\n\n      So to have at least 100000 zeros, we need n > 100000 * 4? Not exactly, but we can set an upper bound for binary search.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use binary search to find L and R without knowing the exact n, but by using the trailing_zeros function.\n\n      How to binary search for L?\n\n          low = 0 (or 1) and high = a sufficiently large number.\n\n          We know that for n=0, trailing_zeros(0)=0. Then we can set:\n\n          We are searching for the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n          Similarly for m+1.\n\n      But note: the maximum m is 100000. The maximum n we might need to consider is when m=100000, then n must be at least around 400000 (because 400000/5 + 400000/25 + ... = 80000 + 16000 + 3200 + ... = 80000+16000=96000, 96000+3200=99200, then next 400000/625=640, so 99200+640=99840, then 400000/3125=128, so 99840+128=99968, then 400000/15625=25.6 -> 25, so 99968+25=99993, then 400000/78125=5.12 -> 5, so 99993+5=99998, then 400000/390625=1.02 -> 1, so 99999. So 400000 gives 99999 zeros. Then for 400001,400002,...,400004: same, then 400005: 400005//5=80001, then 400005//25=16000, etc. so we get more than 100000. \n\n      We can set high to 5*m? Or maybe 5*m*5? Actually, the standard way is to set high to 5*m (this is a common trick) because the trailing zeros grow roughly linearly with n. But note: the trailing zeros function grows as O(n/4) (asymptotically) so we can set high = 5*m (which is safe because n must be at least 5*m to get m zeros? Actually, for m=1, we need at least 5. So for m=100000, we set high = 5*100000 = 500000, but we saw that 400000 already gives about 100000 zeros. So 500000 is safe.\n\n      However, we are doing two binary searches: one for m and one for m+1. We must be cautious.\n\n      Alternatively, we can write a function that, given m, returns the minimal n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m, and then check if the minimal n gives exactly m.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          def find_lower_bound(m):\n              lo = 0\n              hi = 5 * m   # but wait, if m is 100000, then 500000, which is acceptable.\n\n              while lo < hi:\n                  mid = (lo+hi)//2\n                  if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n                      lo = mid+1\n                  else:\n                      hi = mid\n\n              return lo\n\n          Then:\n              L = find_lower_bound(m)\n              R = find_lower_bound(m+1)\n\n          Then, if trailing_zeros(L) == m:\n              k = R - L\n              Then output k and the numbers from L to R-1 (if k>0).\n          Else:\n              k = 0\n              Then output 0.\n\n      But wait: what if m is very large and the trailing_zeros function returns a very large n? The binary search should work because we set hi=5*m, which is an upper bound for n (since to get m zeros, n must be at least 5*m? Actually, no: the minimal n for m zeros is at most 5*m? \n\n      Example: m=1 -> n=5, which is 5*1. \n               m=2 -> n=10, which is 5*2.\n               m=3 -> n=15, which is 5*3.\n               m=4 -> n=20, which is 5*4.\n               m=5 -> n=25? Actually, we saw that 20 gives 4, 21,22,23,24 give 4, 25 gives 6. So the minimal n for m=5 is 25, which is 5*5. \n\n      So in fact, the minimal n for m zeros is at least 5*m (if we think of the case where zeros increase by 1 at every multiple of 5, then we would expect n=5*m). But sometimes we need more because of jumps. \n\n      However, note that the minimal n for m zeros is at most 5*m? Actually, no: consider m=6: \n          The minimal n for 6 zeros is 25, which is 5*5. So 5*m=30, and 25<30. \n\n      Actually, we can set hi to a higher value. Since the zeros grow logarithmically (base 5) in terms of the exponents, but the function is additive, we can set hi to 5*m (which is safe because we know that n must be at least 5*m? Actually, no: the minimal n for m zeros is not necessarily 5*m. \n\n      But note: the minimal n must satisfy: trailing_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n      We know that trailing_zeros(n) ~ n/4 (actually the sum of n/5^k) which is less than n/4. So we require n/4 >= m  => n >= 4*m. So we can set hi to 5*m (which is safe) or even 4*m? But wait, 4*m might be too small because trailing_zeros(n) = n/5+n/25+... < n/4, so if we set hi=4*m, then we might not cover n that gives m zeros. \n\n      Actually, the minimal n is known to be at most 5*m (from the example above: for m=5, we found n=25 which is 5*m). \n\n      But wait: for m=100000, the minimal n must be less than 5*100000? Actually, we saw that 400000 gives about 100000 zeros, so the minimal n for 100000 zeros is at most 400000, which is 4*100000. \n\n      So we can set hi = 5*m, but if we set hi=5*m, then the binary search will work. However, we can set hi = 5*m (which is 500000 for m=100000) and that is acceptable because 500000 is 5e5, and the trailing_zeros function runs in O(log_5(n)) so it's efficient.\n\n 11. Implementation:\n\n      We'll define:\n\n          def trailing_zeros(n):\n              count = 0\n              base = 5\n              while base <= n:\n                  count += n // base\n                  base *= 5\n              return count\n\n      Then:\n\n          def find_lower_bound(m):\n              # We are searching for the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n              lo = 0\n              hi = 5 * m   # We set hi to 5*m, but note: sometimes the minimal n might be larger than 5*m? Actually, no: because the minimal n for m zeros is at most 5*m (as seen in examples). But to be safe, we can set hi to 5*m+100 or use a while loop to extend hi if necessary? However, the problem states m up to 100000, so 5*m is 500000 which is acceptable.\n\n              while lo < hi:\n                  mid = (lo+hi)//2\n                  if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n                      lo = mid+1\n                  else:\n                      hi = mid\n\n              return lo\n\n      Then:\n\n          m_val = int(input().strip())\n          L = find_lower_bound(m_val)\n          R = find_lower_bound(m_val+1)\n\n          if trailing_zeros(L) == m_val:\n              count = R - L\n              print(count)\n              # Then print the numbers from L to R-1\n              if count > 0:\n                  # Format: print each number separated by space\n                  numbers = [str(i) for i in range(L, R)]\n                  print(\" \".join(numbers))\n              else:\n                  # Then there are no numbers, but we already printed 0, so nothing more?\n                  # Actually, if count==0, then we only printed 0 and that's it.\n                  pass\n          else:\n              print(0)\n\n 12. But wait: what if m_val is 0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n 13. However, let's test with the examples:\n\n      Example 1: m=1\n          trailing_zeros(5)=1 -> so L=5, then trailing_zeros(5)==1 -> True.\n          Then R = find_lower_bound(2) -> smallest n with trailing_zeros(n)>=2: n=10.\n          Then the numbers are from 5 to 9 (inclusive). Count=5, so output:\n              5\n              5 6 7 8 9\n\n      Example 2: m=5\n          L = smallest n with trailing_zeros(n)>=5 -> 25 (because trailing_zeros(24)=4, trailing_zeros(25)=6)\n          Then trailing_zeros(25)=6 !=5 -> so we output 0.\n\n      Example 3: m=6\n          L = smallest n with trailing_zeros(n)>=6 -> 25 (because trailing_zeros(25)=6>=6 -> so L=25)\n          Then trailing_zeros(25)==6 -> True.\n          Then R = smallest n with trailing_zeros(n)>=7 -> 30 (because trailing_zeros(29)=6, trailing_zeros(30)=7)\n          Then the numbers from 25 to 29 (5 numbers) -> output 5 and then \"25 26 27 28 29\"\n\n 14. Edge: m=100000, then we compute L and R. The trailing_zeros function for n=500000 (our hi) is:\n\n          trailing_zeros(500000) = 500000//5 + 500000//25 + 500000//125 + ... \n          = 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 = 124998 (approx)\n\n      So for m=100000, L will be the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n)>=100000. We can calculate that n is about 400000 as we saw earlier (400000 gives 99998, so we need 400000+?).\n\n      We don't need to know the exact n, but we must ensure that our binary search and trailing_zeros function can handle n up to 500000 (which is acceptable because the while loop in trailing_zeros runs about log5(500000) ~ 7-8 iterations).\n\n 15. Code:\n\n      Let's code accordingly.\n\n 16. One more thing: performance.\n\n      The binary search will run in O(log(5*m)) steps, and each step calls trailing_zeros which runs in O(log_5(n)) (which is about 7 for n=500000). So total operations is about 20 * 7 = 140, which is acceptable.\n\n 17. Let's write the code.\n\n  Note: We must read from stdin and output as specified.\n\n  Example input: ['1', '5'] (but note: the example input is given as a list of strings, but we are reading one integer per input line.)\n\n  Actually, the input is: The only line of input contains an integer m.\n\n  So:\n\n      m_val = int(input().strip())\n\n  Then proceed.\n\n  But note: the example output for input 1 is:\n\n        5\n        5 6 7 8 9\n\n  And for input 5 is:\n\n        0\n\n  However, the example input is given as:\n\n        Input: ['1', '5']\n\n  But that's just an example representation. Our program reads one integer.\n\n  Let's run the example m=1 and m=5.\n\n  Code:\n\n      def trailing_zeros(n):\n          if n == 0:\n              return 0\n          count = 0\n          base = 5\n          while base <= n:\n              count += n // base\n              base *= 5\n          return count\n\n      def find_lower_bound(m):\n          if m == 0:\n              return 0\n          lo = 0\n          hi = 5 * m   # We set hi to 5*m, but note: if m is large, this might be too low? Actually, we saw that for m=100000, the minimal n is about 400000, which is less than 500000, so it's safe.\n\n          # But wait: what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we ignore.\n\n          while lo < hi:\n              mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n              if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n                  lo = mid + 1\n              else:\n                  hi = mid\n          return lo\n\n      m_val = int(input().strip())\n      L = find_lower_bound(m_val)\n      R = find_lower_bound(m_val+1)\n\n      if trailing_zeros(L) == m_val:\n          count = R - L\n          print(count)\n          if count > 0:\n              numbers = [str(x) for x in range(L, R)]\n              print(\" \".join(numbers))\n      else:\n          print(0)\n\n  Let me test with m=1 and m=5.\n\n  m=1: \n      L = find_lower_bound(1): \n          lo=0, hi=5\n          mid=2 -> trailing_zeros(2)=0 <1 -> lo=3\n          then mid=(3+5)//2=4 -> trailing_zeros(4)=0<1 -> lo=5\n          then lo=5, hi=5 -> return 5.\n\n      trailing_zeros(5)=1 -> matches.\n      R = find_lower_bound(2): \n          lo=0, hi=10\n          mid=5: trailing_zeros(5)=1 <2 -> lo=6\n          then mid=(6+10)//2=8: trailing_zeros(8)=1<2 -> lo=9\n          then mid=9: trailing_zeros(9)=1<2 -> lo=10\n          returns 10.\n\n      Then output: \n          5\n          5 6 7 8 9\n\n  m=5:\n      L = find_lower_bound(5): \n          We are looking for the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n)>=5.\n          We know that at n=24: trailing_zeros(24)=4, n=25:6.\n          So we do binary search from 0 to 25 (5*5=25) but wait, our hi is 5*5=25.\n\n          lo=0, hi=25\n          mid=12: trailing_zeros(12)=2 -> <5 -> lo=13\n          mid= (13+25)//2=19: trailing_zeros(19)=3 -> <5 -> lo=20\n          mid= (20+25)//2=22: trailing_zeros(22)=4 -> <5 -> lo=23\n          mid=23: trailing_zeros(23)=4 -> lo=24\n          mid=24: trailing_zeros(24)=4 -> lo=25, hi=25 -> return 25.\n\n      Then check: trailing_zeros(25)=6 !=5 -> output 0.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  However, note: what if the minimal n for m is beyond 5*m? Then our hi=5*m would be too low and the binary search would return 5*m even if trailing_zeros(5*m) < m? \n\n  Actually, we set hi=5*m, but if the minimal n is greater than 5*m, then the binary search will set hi to that minimal n (by extending the hi) because we start from 0 to 5*m. But wait, our hi is set to 5*m initially. If the minimal n is beyond 5*m, then the binary search will not find it because we set hi=5*m and then the condition trailing_zeros(mid) < m may force lo to go beyond 5*m? \n\n  Actually, the binary search condition is:\n\n      while lo < hi:\n          mid = (lo+hi)//2\n          if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n              lo = mid+1\n          else:\n              hi = mid\n\n      This binary search finds the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m, but if we set hi too low (like 5*m) and the minimal n is larger than 5*m, then the while loop condition breaks when hi becomes 5*m and if trailing_zeros(5*m) < m, then we set lo=5*m+1 and then break, returning 5*m+1. \n\n  But wait, we set hi=5*m initially. Then if the minimal n is 5*m+1, then during the binary search, we might never check beyond 5*m.\n\n  Example: m=5, and minimal n is 25 (which is 5*5). So our hi=25 is correct.\n\n  But consider m=100000. We set hi=500000. We know that trailing_zeros(500000)=124998 (approx) which is >100000, so the minimal n for 100000 zeros is definitely <=500000. \n\n  Why is that? Because the trailing zeros function is increasing and we know that at n=5*m (500000) we have at least 124998 zeros, which is more than 100000. So the minimal n for 100000 zeros must be <=500000.\n\n  In fact, the minimal n for m zeros is at most 5*m (in the sense that 5*m is an upper bound for the minimal n). Why?\n\n      We know that the trailing zeros in n! is at least n//5 (ignoring higher powers). So to get m zeros, we need n//5 >= m? Not exactly, because we have to account for the higher powers. But note:\n\n          trailing_zeros(n) = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... >= n//5.\n\n          So if we set n = 5*m, then trailing_zeros(5*m) >= (5*m)//5 = m. Therefore, the minimal n for m zeros is at most 5*m.\n\n      This is a key observation: because 5*m is an upper bound (not necessarily tight, but an upper bound). So our initial hi=5*m is safe.\n\n  Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n  Let's run with m=6 (which we know the answer is 5 numbers: 25 to 29).\n\n      m_val=6\n      L = find_lower_bound(6): \n          We know that trailing_zeros(24)=4, trailing_zeros(25)=6 -> so L=25.\n          Then R = find_lower_bound(7): \n              trailing_zeros(29)=6, trailing_zeros(30)=7 -> so R=30.\n          Then output: \n              5\n              25 26 27 28 29\n\n  But wait, the example output for m=6 is 5 numbers, but the sample input was m=1 and m=5. \n\n  We are good.\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\"\n\n  So for m=6, we output:\n\n      5\n      25 26 27 28 29\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But note: the example input in the problem is:\n\n      Input: ['1', '5']\n\n  And the expected output is:\n\n      ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n  However, our code for m=1 produces:\n\n      First line: 5\n      Second line: 5 6 7 8 9\n\n  And for m=5: 0.\n\n  But note: the problem expects the output for m=5 to be just 0 (without any additional text). \n\n  We are printing only 0 for m=5.\n\n  But wait, the example input format is a list of two strings? Actually, the problem says:\n\n      Input: The only line of input contains an integer m.\n\n  So we read one integer.\n\n  However, the example input is given as:\n\n      ['1', '5']\n\n  This might be interpreted as two separate test cases? Actually, no.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of the primes 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is dictated by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(L) \\geq m \\) and the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that \\( \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(R) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values lie in the interval \\([L, R-1]\\) if \\( \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(L) = m \\). Otherwise, there are no such \\( n \\) values.\n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: The binary search efficiently narrows down the bounds \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) by leveraging the monotonic nature of the trailing zeroes function. The trailing zeroes calculation itself is optimized by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 until the power exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    base = 5\n    while base <= n:\n        count += n // base\n        base *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower_bound(m):\n    lo = 0\n    hi = 5 * m\n    \n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            lo = mid + 1\n        else:\n            hi = mid\n            \n    return lo\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    m_val = int(data[0].strip())\n    \n    L = find_lower_bound(m_val)\n    R = find_lower_bound(m_val + 1)\n    \n    if trailing_zeros(L) == m_val:\n        count = R - L\n        print(count)\n        if count > 0:\n            numbers = [str(x) for x in range(L, R)]\n            print(\" \".join(numbers))\n    else:\n        print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by 5, 25, 125, etc., until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **find_lower_bound(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m \\). The search space is set from 0 to \\( 5 \\times m \\) as an upper bound, which is sufficient because the trailing zeroes function grows roughly linearly with \\( n \\).\n\n3. **main()**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\), computes the bounds \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) using `find_lower_bound`, checks if \\( \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(L) \\) equals \\( m \\), and outputs the count of valid \\( n \\) values along with the values themselves if they exist. If no such \\( n \\) exists, it simply outputs 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging mathematical insights and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of \\( m \\) up to 100,000.",
