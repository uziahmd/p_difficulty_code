    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a more straightforward method.\n Since the string is short, we can try all possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (which is n//2) down to 1 and check for duplicates.\n\n However, note: The problem says occurrences can overlap. So we are looking for two (or more) occurrences of a substring that may overlap.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. Let n = len(string). The maximum length of a substring that can appear at least twice is at most floor(n/2) + something? Actually, if we have a substring of length L, then the starting indices must be at least L apart to not overlap? But wait: the problem says they can overlap. However, the problem is about two occurrences that can be overlapping. But note: the definition of substring in this context is contiguous. \n\n Example: \"aaa\" -> substrings: \n   'a' appears at positions 0,1,2 -> so we can have two overlapping occurrences.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n Important: The two occurrences must be distinct? Actually, the problem says \"at least twice\". So we need two (or more) non-overlapping? Actually, no: the problem says \"can overlap\", meaning that the two occurrences can share some characters. But the substring itself is contiguous and we are counting two different starting indices.\n\n However, note: the example input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] gives outputs [0,3,2].\n\n For \"abcd\": \n   There is no substring of length>=1 that appears at least twice? Actually, let's check:\n     length=1: 'a','b','c','d' each appear once -> no duplicate.\n     length=2: 'ab','bc','cd' -> no duplicates.\n     length=3: 'abc','bcd' -> no duplicates.\n     length=4: entire string -> no duplicate.\n   So output 0.\n\n For \"ababa\":\n   The substring \"aba\" appears twice: starting at index0 and index2 (overlapping). Also, \"bab\" appears twice? Actually, \"aba\" is the longest because:\n     length=5: entire string -> only once.\n     length=4: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> each appears once.\n     length=3: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" (again). So \"aba\" appears twice. Also, \"bab\" appears twice? \n        \"ababa\": \n          substring starting at 0: \"aba\"\n          substring starting at 1: \"bab\"\n          substring starting at 2: \"aba\"\n        So \"aba\" and \"bab\" both appear twice. But note: the longest is 3.\n\n   However, wait: the sample output for \"ababa\" is 3. So we are to output 3.\n\n For \"zzz\":\n   The substring \"z\" appears three times. The substring \"zz\" appears twice (overlapping: from index0 to index1 and index1 to index2). \n   But note: the problem asks for the longest substring that appears at least twice. \n      \"zz\" has length 2 and appears twice (as two consecutive 'z's). \n      \"z\" has length 1 and appears three times.\n\n   However, the sample output is 2.\n\n Approach:\n\n We are to find the maximum length L such that there exist two (or more) starting indices i and j (with i < j) such that s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L].\n\n Since the string is short (<=100), we can do:\n\n Option 1: iterate over possible lengths from min(n, ...) down to 1, and for each length, check all contiguous substrings of that length and record which ones we've seen. If we see a substring twice, then we return that length.\n\n However, note: we want the longest one. So we can start from the maximum possible length (which is floor(n/2) ???) but actually, the maximum length for a repeated substring is at most n-1 (if we have two same adjacent letters, then we can have a substring of length 1 repeated many times). But wait, what's the maximum length? It can be up to floor((n+1)/2) ? Actually, no: consider \"aaaaaa\": \n   The entire string is length 6. Can we have two occurrences of the entire string? No, unless we have two copies. But note: the substring must be contiguous and we can have overlapping. However, if we take the entire string, then we can only have one occurrence. \n\n Actually, the condition for having two occurrences of a substring of length L is that we can find two starting indices i and j (i < j) such that j-i >= L? Not necessarily: because they can overlap, but if they overlap then the two occurrences must be within the same string and the second occurrence must start at j, and then the first occurrence ends at i+L-1, and the second starts at j. The condition is just that the two substrings are the same. However, they must not necessarily be disjoint. \n\n But note: the entire string cannot be repeated as a substring of length n because there is only one occurrence.\n\n What is the maximum L for which a substring can appear at least twice?\n   We require that there are two starting indices i and j (with i<j) such that i+L <= n and j+L <= n? Actually, no: the substring starting at i is from i to i+L-1, and the substring starting at j is from j to j+L-1. They must be entirely contained in the string.\n\n   So the condition is: we can have two occurrences as long as we have two starting indices i and j (with i<j) and j-i >= L? Actually, no: they can overlap. For example, in \"ababa\", L=3: we have two occurrences: starting at 0 and 2. The distance between the two starting indices is 2, and L=3, so the first occurrence covers [0,2] and the second [2,4]. They overlap at index2.\n\n   However, we don't require disjointness. The condition is just that the two substrings are the same and they are contained in the string.\n\n   Therefore, we can consider any substring of length L and check for duplicates.\n\n   But note: the entire string of length n can only appear once, so we don't need to consider L=n.\n\n   The maximum L we need to consider is from 1 up to n-1 (because if we take L = n, then there is only one substring).\n\n   However, we are to find the longest. So we can start from L = n-1 down to 1, and for each L, check if there exists at least one substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n   How to check for a fixed L?\n        We can generate all contiguous substrings of length L (there are n - L + 1 of them) and use a set or dictionary to count the frequency.\n\n   Since n is at most 100, and L can be from 1 to 99, the total number of substrings we check is sum_{L=1}^{99} (n-L+1) which is about O(n^2) and n is 100, so maximum 100*100 = 10000 substrings, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we are going from the largest L (n-1) down to 1, so we can break early when we find the first L for which there's a duplicate.\n\n   But note: we want the longest, so we start with L = n-1 and go down until we find one that has a duplicate. Then that is the answer.\n\n   However, it's possible that for a larger L, we don't have a duplicate, but for a smaller L we do. But we are going from large to small, so we want the first (largest) L that satisfies the condition.\n\n   Example: \"ababa\": n=5, we check L=4: \n        substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicates -> skip.\n        L=3: substrings: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> we see \"aba\" twice -> so answer 3.\n\n   Example: \"abcd\": n=4, check L=3: \"abc\",\"bcd\" -> no duplicates; L=2: \"ab\",\"bc\",\"cd\" -> no duplicates; L=1: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicates -> then answer 0.\n\n   Example: \"zzz\": n=3, check L=2: substrings: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> two occurrences -> so answer 2.\n\n   But wait: in \"zzz\", for L=2: \n        substring starting at 0: \"zz\"\n        substring starting at 1: \"zz\"\n        so we have two occurrences. So we output 2.\n\n   However, what if we have a string like \"aabb\"? \n        n=4, check L=3: \"aab\", \"abb\" -> no duplicates.\n        L=2: \"aa\", \"ab\", \"bb\" -> \"aa\" and \"bb\" appear once, \"ab\" appears once -> no duplicates.\n        L=1: \"a\",\"a\",\"b\",\"b\" -> \"a\" and \"b\" appear twice, so we would have found a duplicate at L=1. But wait: we are going from high to low, so we break at the first duplicate we find (from high to low). However, we are checking from L=3, then 2, then 1. But we are looking for the longest. So we should check from the highest L (which is 3) and then 2, and then 1. And we break when we find the first duplicate (the highest L for which a duplicate exists). \n\n   But note: the problem does not require that the two occurrences are non-overlapping. In \"aabb\", the substring \"a\" (L=1) appears multiple times, but also \"aa\" (L=2) appears only once? Actually, \"aa\" is the substring from index0 to index1. Then \"bb\" is from index2 to index3. But \"aa\" and \"bb\" are two different substrings. The substring \"a\" (L=1) appears at index0, index1, index2? Actually, in \"aabb\": \n        index0: 'a'\n        index1: 'a'\n        index2: 'b'\n        index3: 'b'\n\n   So the substring \"a\" appears twice (at index0 and index1). Similarly, \"b\" appears twice (at index2 and index3). \n\n   However, the problem says \"longest substring that can be met at least twice\". So the longest is 1, because for L=2 there is no duplicate. But wait, what about \"aa\" and \"bb\"? They are of length 2 and each appears once. But we are checking for a substring that appears at least twice. So for L=2, we don't have any substring that appears twice. Therefore, we look at L=1 and we have \"a\" and \"b\" each appearing twice. So the answer for \"aabb\" would be 1.\n\n   However, wait: the sample input did not include \"aabb\". But according to our reasoning, the answer for \"aabb\" is 1.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\"\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n   Let s be the input string, n = len(s)\n   Let max_dup = 0\n\n   We'll check for L from n-1 down to 1:\n        seen = {}   # dictionary to count frequency of each substring of length L\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                seen[substr] += 1\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n\n            # If we already have one duplicate, we can break early for this L?\n            # Actually, we don't need to break because we are only interested in whether there is at least one substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n        Now, check if there is any substring in seen with count >=2? Actually, we can check: if we found at least one substring that appears at least twice, then we set max_dup = L and break the loop.\n\n   But wait: we are iterating L from high to low, so the first L for which we find at least one duplicate is the answer.\n\n   However, note: we might have multiple duplicates, but we only care if there's at least one.\n\n   But what if we don't find any duplicate for any L? Then we output 0.\n\n   However, there's a catch: when we check for a given L, we are generating all substrings of length L. But if we break early (when we find one duplicate) we can avoid scanning the entire list.\n\n   We can optimize the inner loop: if we ever find a substring that we've seen before, we can break out of the inner loop and record that we found a duplicate for this L.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        found = False\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                seen[substr] += 1\n                if seen[substr] == 2:   # we only need two occurrences to satisfy the condition\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n        if found:\n            print(L)\n            exit(0)\n\n   But wait: we are breaking at the first duplicate for this L. However, we are only checking for two occurrences. But note: if we see a substring for the first time, we mark it as 1. Then if we see it again, we mark it as 2 and break. This is correct because we only need two occurrences.\n\n   However, what if the substring appears more than twice? Then we break at the second occurrence.\n\n   But what if we break the inner loop, then we have found an L that works and we output L and exit.\n\n   But note: we are going from the largest L to smallest, so the first L we find is the longest.\n\n   However, there's a problem: the above inner loop breaks at the first duplicate encountered, but what if the duplicate we break on is not the only one? Actually, we don't care: we only need one duplicate.\n\n   But wait: what if the first duplicate we encounter is for a substring that we have already seen, but then we break. But we haven't checked all substrings? Actually, we break as soon as we see a substring that has appeared before. That means we have found two occurrences (one from a previous index and one at the current index). So that's sufficient.\n\n   However, consider: we are building the dictionary as we go. When we see a substring that we've seen, we break. But what if we see a substring that we haven't seen, then we store it. Then later, we might see the same substring again? But we break at the first time we see a duplicate. But that is the minimal requirement: we only need one duplicate to say that for this L, there exists a substring that appears at least twice.\n\n   But note: we are iterating from the beginning to the end. The duplicate we find is the earliest duplicate for any substring.\n\n   However, we are not required to find the longest substring that appears at least twice, but the longest length for which there exists a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n   So we break the inner loop as soon as we find the first duplicate (so we don't have to check the rest for this L).\n\n   But wait: what if we have two different substrings of the same length that both appear twice? Then we break at the first duplicate we encounter. But we don't need to know about the second one because we are only concerned with the existence of at least one duplicate for this L.\n\n   However, the above code does not account for the possibility that we might see a substring that we've seen, but then we break and output L. But what if we see a substring that we've seen, and then later we see another substring that we've seen? We break at the first duplicate, but that's okay because we only need one duplicate.\n\n   But note: we are checking from left to right. We break as soon as we have one duplicate.\n\n   However, there's an alternative: we could break the outer loop as soon as we find one duplicate for the current L.\n\n   But wait: what if the same substring appears multiple times? We break at the second occurrence. But if we break the inner loop, we don't check the rest. But that's okay because we are only interested in the existence.\n\n   However, we must note: we are using a dictionary that we are building. The key is the substring. But if we break early, we haven't built the entire dictionary, but that's okay.\n\n   But consider: we are only storing the frequency of the substrings we have seen. We break at the first duplicate. But what if the duplicate we break on is for a substring that we have seen only once so far? Actually, we update the frequency and then break. But we are updating the frequency and then breaking.\n\n   However, there's a flaw: if we break at the first duplicate, we don't know if there's a longer L that also has a duplicate. But we are iterating from large L to small, so we break the outer loop when we find a duplicate, and that is the answer.\n\n   But wait: what if a longer L doesn't have a duplicate, but a shorter L does? Then we break the outer loop at the first duplicate (which is the longest L) and output it.\n\n   Example: \"ababa\": \n        L=4: no duplicate -> move to L=3: we break at the second \"aba\" (first occurrence at i=0, then at i=2 we see \"aba\" again) -> output 3.\n\n   Example: \"aabb\": \n        L=3: no duplicate -> L=2: no duplicate -> L=1: \n            i=0: 'a' -> seen['a']=1\n            i=1: 'a' -> seen['a']=2 -> break and output 1.\n\n   Example: \"abcda\": \n        n=5, \n        Check L=4: substrings: \"abcd\", \"bcda\" -> no duplicate.\n        Check L=3: \"abc\", \"bcd\", \"cda\" -> no duplicate.\n        Check L=2: \"ab\",\"bc\",\"cd\",\"da\" -> no duplicate.\n        Check L=1: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\",\"a\" -> at i=0: 'a'=1, i=4: 'a'=2 -> break and output 1.\n\n   But wait: in \"abcda\", the substring \"a\" appears twice (at index0 and index4) and that's the only duplicate.\n\n   However, note: the substring \"bc\" and \"cd\" etc. are unique. So the answer is 1.\n\n   But wait: is there a substring of length 1 that appears twice? Yes, 'a'. So that's correct.\n\n   However, what about the substring \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"? They appear only once. But we break at the first duplicate we find (for 'a').\n\n   But note: we are iterating from the beginning. We break at the first duplicate we meet. But we are checking for every starting index. So we will break at the last occurrence of a duplicate? Actually, we break at the second occurrence of any duplicate. But we are going from left to right. We might miss a duplicate that occurs later? \n\n   Actually, no: we break as soon as we see a duplicate. But we are building the dictionary as we traverse. So if we see a substring that we've seen before, we break.\n\n   However, we must note: the same substring might appear more than twice, but we break at the second occurrence. But we don't need to know about the third.\n\n   But what if the second occurrence is not the one we break on? Actually, we break at the first time we see a duplicate. But note: the duplicate we see is the second occurrence of that substring.\n\n   However, there's an edge: what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the second occurrence, which is correct.\n\n   But wait: what if we have two different substrings that both appear twice? We break at the first duplicate we encounter. But we are scanning from left to right, so the first duplicate we encounter is the second occurrence of the first substring that repeats.\n\n   But that's okay because we are only concerned with the existence of at least one substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n   However, there is a potential issue: we are not checking all substrings for a given L. But we break at the first duplicate. But we are building the dictionary as we go, so we know that we have at least two occurrences of that substring.\n\n   But what if the duplicate we break on is not the one that we are currently looking at? Actually, we are storing the frequency. We break when we see a substring that we have seen (so we have stored it at least once) and then we update the count and break.\n\n   However, we must consider: we are iterating from left to right. We might not have seen the substring until we get to the current index. But that's okay.\n\n   But wait: we are storing the frequency of the substring. The moment we see a substring that we have seen before, we break.\n\n   However, there's one more thing: we are updating the frequency and then breaking. But what if the same substring appears again later? We break at the first duplicate, so we don't need to know about the subsequent ones.\n\n   But note: we are only interested in the existence of at least one substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n   However, the above method will break the inner loop as soon as we find the first duplicate for any substring (of length L). That is sufficient.\n\n   But wait: what if the first duplicate we find is for a substring that is not the one that we want? Actually, we are only concerned with the existence of any duplicate. So we break as soon as we find one.\n\n   However, we must consider: we are iterating from the largest L to the smallest. So we break the outer loop as soon as we find a duplicate for the current L.\n\n   But what if we don't break the outer loop? Then we continue to the next L. But we are breaking the inner loop and then checking found. Then we break the outer loop.\n\n   But note: we are breaking the inner loop (the one over i) and then we break the outer loop (the one over L) by exiting and printing the answer.\n\n   However, we must not break the outer loop until we check all L from high to low. Actually, we break the inner loop (for i) and then check if found is True. Then we break the outer loop (for L) and output the answer.\n\n   But wait, the code above uses an exit(0) or we can use a flag to break the outer loop.\n\n   Let me restructure:\n\n   n = len(s)\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        duplicate_found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                seen[substr] += 1\n                if seen[substr] == 2:\n                    duplicate_found = True\n                    break\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n        if duplicate_found:\n            print(L)\n            exit(0)   # or break out and then print, but we can break the outer loop.\n\n   But wait: what if we don't break the outer loop? Then we continue to the next L. But we break the inner loop and then check duplicate_found. Then we break the outer loop and print L.\n\n   However, we can also do:\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            seen[substr] = seen.get(substr, 0) + 1\n            if seen[substr] == 2:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n\n   But wait, this is incorrect: we break at the second occurrence of the same substring. But note: we are updating the dictionary and then checking if the count becomes 2. However, we are not storing the first occurrence separately. But that's okay.\n\n   But the above code breaks at the second occurrence. However, what if we have two different substrings? We break at the first substring that gets duplicated. But that's okay.\n\n   However, there's a problem: we are updating the dictionary for every substring. But we break at the second occurrence of a substring. But what if the same substring appears again (third time)? Then we break at the second occurrence, so we don't need to wait for the third.\n\n   But wait: the above code does not break the inner loop, it just prints and exits. But we are breaking the entire program.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            seen[substr] = seen.get(substr, 0) + 1\n            if seen[substr] == 2:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n\n   But wait, this does not work: because we break at the second occurrence of the same substring, but what if the substring we are seeing now is the second occurrence, but there might be a longer L that also has a duplicate? No, because we are going from large L to small, and we break at the first duplicate (largest L) and then exit.\n\n   But wait: what if we have two different substrings of the same length? We break at the first duplicate we encounter. But the above code breaks at the first substring that gets duplicated. However, we are iterating from the beginning. So we might break too early?\n\n   Example: \"ababa\" with L=3: \n        i=0: substr=\"aba\" -> seen: {\"aba\":1}\n        i=1: substr=\"bab\" -> seen: {\"aba\":1, \"bab\":1}\n        i=2: substr=\"aba\" -> seen: {\"aba\":2, \"bab\":1} -> then we break and output 3.\n\n   But wait, we break at the second occurrence of \"aba\", which is correct.\n\n   However, what if the duplicate happens for a substring that is not the one we are interested in? Actually, we break at the first duplicate. But that's okay because we only need one duplicate.\n\n   But note: we are iterating from the largest L to the smallest. So we break at the first duplicate we find (in terms of the largest L). \n\n   However, there's an alternative: we might have two different substrings of the same length that both appear twice. But we break at the first duplicate we meet. But that's okay because we are only concerned with the existence.\n\n   But wait: what if the duplicate we break on is for a substring of length L, but there is a longer substring (with the same length) that we haven't checked? No, because we are checking from the largest L (n-1) downward.\n\n   But wait, we are checking for a fixed L. We break the inner loop (for i) as soon as we find a duplicate for that L.\n\n   However, the above code does not break the inner loop, it just prints and exits. But we are inside the inner loop. We break the entire program.\n\n   But wait, we are breaking the entire program by exit(0). But we can also break the inner loop and then break the outer loop.\n\n   Actually, the above code is acceptable because we are breaking the entire program. But if we don't want to use exit(0), we can do:\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            seen[substr] = seen.get(substr, 0) + 1\n            if seen[substr] == 2:\n                print(L)\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n\n   But wait, the else clause in for-loop is executed if the loop didn't break. Then we break the outer loop if the inner loop broke.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a flag.\n\n   However, the problem says the string length is at most 100, so performance is not a big issue.\n\n   But note: we are using a dictionary and slicing the string. The slicing operation s[i:i+L] creates a new string. The total work is O(n^3) because for each L (which is about n) and for each i (about n) we are creating a substring of length L (which takes O(L)). So the total operations is about sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L. \n\n   Since n<=100, the worst-case is about 100*100*100 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can optimize by using a rolling hash to compare substrings without slicing, but given n=100, it's acceptable.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if there is no duplicate for any L? Then we never break and we exit the loops. Then we must output 0.\n\n   We can handle that by:\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            seen[substr] = seen.get(substr, 0) + 1\n            if seen[substr] == 2:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n\n   Then after the loops, we print 0.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   ans = 0\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            seen[substr] = seen.get(substr, 0) + 1\n            if seen[substr] == 2:\n                ans = L\n                break\n        if ans != 0:\n            break\n\n   print(ans)\n\n   But wait, we break the inner loop and then break the outer loop. Then we output ans.\n\n   However, if we don't break the outer loop, then we keep checking for smaller L. But we are going from high to low, and we break at the first duplicate (the largest L). So we can break the outer loop.\n\n   But note: we are breaking the inner loop and then breaking the outer loop. Then we output the answer.\n\n   But wait, what if we don't break the outer loop? Then we output 0.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   ans = 0\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            seen[substr] = seen.get(substr, 0) + 1\n            if seen[substr] == 2:\n                ans = L\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n\n   print(ans)\n\n   But then if we break the outer loop, we output ans. Otherwise, if we don't break the outer loop, we output 0.\n\n   However, we can also do:\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            seen[substr] = seen.get(substr, 0) + 1\n            if seen[substr] == 2:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n\n   print(0)\n\n   But the problem says: the input is a string. We must read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of strings, but actually, the problem says the first input line contains the string.\n\n   So we must read one string.\n\n   Example input: \n        Input: \"abcd\"\n\n   But the example input format is shown as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] which is an array of examples, but the actual input is one string per run.\n\n   Since it's competitive programming, we assume one test case.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty and consists of lower-case Latin letters.\n\n   Code:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n   # If the string is empty, but guaranteed non-empty, so we don't handle empty.\n\n   # We'll check for L from n-1 down to 1.\n\n   # But wait: what if n==1? Then the maximum L is 0 (because we start from n-1=0). Then we output 0.\n\n   However, if n==1, then the substring must be of length 0? Actually, the problem says the string is non-empty, but we are checking from L=n-1 to 1. For n=1, the loop runs from 0 to 1 (exclusive) so no iteration. Then we output 0.\n\n   But wait, for n=1: \n        The string is of length 1. The only substring of length>=1 is the entire string. But we don't consider L=1 because we start from n-1=0 and go down to 1, so we don't check L=1. Then we output 0.\n\n   But for n=1, there is no substring of length>=1 that appears at least twice (since the entire string is unique). So 0 is correct.\n\n   But wait: we defined L from n-1 down to 1. For n=1, that means we don't check any L (since range(0,0) is empty). Then we output 0.\n\n   But wait, we must check L from n-1 down to 1. For n=1, n-1=0, so we check L=0? \n\n   Actually, the problem: the substring of length 0 is the empty string. The empty string appears everywhere? Actually, the problem says \"substring\", and typically the empty string is considered to appear at every gap, so infinitely many times. But the problem says \"non-empty string\", but the substring can be empty? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\" \n\n   The empty substring (length 0) is met at least twice (actually many times). But the problem states that the string is non-empty, but the substring can be empty. \n\n   But note: the problem says the string is of lower-case Latin letters. And the substring must be contiguous. The empty substring is contiguous.\n\n   However, the problem examples: \"abcd\" -> output 0. But if we consider the empty substring, then we would output 0 (because we are looking for the longest, and 0 is the length of the empty substring) and then if we found a duplicate for L=0, we break and output 0. But wait: we are not checking L=0.\n\n   The problem says: the string is non-empty. The substring can be empty? The problem doesn't explicitly forbid it. But the examples output 0 for \"abcd\", which is the same as the empty substring.\n\n   However, the problem says \"at least twice\". The empty substring appears n+1 times (if the string has length n). So it appears at least twice. Then the answer for any string should be 0? \n\n   But wait: the problem says \"longest substring\". The empty substring has length 0. Is there a substring of length>=1 that appears at least twice? Then we would output that. Otherwise, 0.\n\n   But the problem examples: \n        \"abcd\": output 0 -> which is the empty substring? But wait, the problem says \"longest substring\", and 0 is the length. \n\n   However, the problem says \"at least twice\". The empty substring is allowed and appears many times. Then why is the answer 0 for \"abcd\"?\n\n   Because 0 is the length of the empty substring, and there is no non-empty substring that appears at least twice. But wait, the problem doesn't say non-empty substring. So the empty substring is always present. \n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the examples: \n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n        Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   So for \"abcd\", output is 0. \n\n   But if we consider the empty substring, then the answer for any string would be 0? Because the empty substring is always there. \n\n   However, the problem probably implies non-empty substring? Or the problem does not consider the empty substring.\n\n   Let me read the problem statement: \"You're given a string of lower-case Latin letters. Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\"\n\n   Typically, in such problems, the substring is assumed to be contiguous and non-empty? Or empty substring is allowed?\n\n   But the examples: \n        \"abcd\": no non-empty substring appears twice, so the answer is 0 (meaning no positive length substring) and the empty substring is not considered?",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution must efficiently handle all edge cases, including strings where no such substring exists.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous substring that occurs at least twice in the input string. The key observation here is that the solution must consider all possible substring lengths from the largest possible down to 1, checking for duplicates as early as possible to optimize performance.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1, we can break early once we find the first occurrence of a duplicate substring. This ensures that we return the longest valid substring without unnecessary computations.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each possible substring length L, we generate all contiguous substrings of length L and use a dictionary to track their frequencies. If any substring appears at least twice, we immediately return L as the result.\n4. **Optimization**: The algorithm leverages early terminationâ€”once a duplicate is found for a given L, it stops further checks for that L and proceeds to smaller lengths if necessary. This reduces the number of operations significantly, especially for longer strings.\n5. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3) due to nested loops (for each L and each starting index) and substring slicing. However, given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach remains efficient enough for the problem's requirements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    ans = 0\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            seen[substr] = seen.get(substr, 0) + 1\n            if seen[substr] == 2:\n                ans = L\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the longest valid substring found.\n3. **Iterating Over Substring Lengths**: The loop runs from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1. For each length L, it checks all contiguous substrings of that length.\n4. **Tracking Substring Frequencies**: A dictionary `seen` is used to count occurrences of each substring. If a substring is encountered for the second time, the current length L is recorded as the answer, and the loop breaks early.\n5. **Output Result**: After processing all relevant lengths, the result (either the found length or 0 if no duplicates were found) is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination and handles all edge cases, including strings where no duplicate substrings exist.",
