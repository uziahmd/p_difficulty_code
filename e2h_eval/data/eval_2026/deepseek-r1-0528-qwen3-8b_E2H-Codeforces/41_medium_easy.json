There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m and then m lines of restrictions [l_i, r_i, x_i]\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming or even try to use a direct assignment with constraints.\n\n However, note that the problem has multiple overlapping constraints (ranges) and the profit is the sum of squares.\n\n Idea: \n We have to assign a height a_i in [0, h] for each spot i (from 1 to n) such that for every restriction (l, r, x): \n   max{ a_i for i from l to r } <= x.\n\n But note: there might be multiple restrictions. Also, the overall maximum height per spot is h.\n\n Since n and m are small (<=50), but the state space is 51^n which is too big, we need a better idea.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the following:\n\n 1. Without any restrictions, the optimal would be to set every house to h, because the profit is a^2 and h is the maximum allowed.\n    Then profit = n * h^2.\n\n 2. But restrictions may lower the heights in some regions.\n\n Another approach: since the restrictions are given by intervals, we can consider the constraints as \"at least one house in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i\"?\n Actually, the restriction says the tallest house in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. So no house in that interval can exceed x_i.\n\n But note: it's the maximum in the interval, so if we have two restrictions, they might force different heights in overlapping areas.\n\n Since n, m, h are small (<=50) but the number of spots is only 50, we can try to use DP that iterates over the positions and keeps track of the active restrictions?\n\n Alternatively, we can use the fact that the restrictions are independent per interval. But the catch is that one house might be covered by multiple intervals.\n\n Observation: The entire set of restrictions must be satisfied. Therefore, for each spot i, the height a_i must be at most the minimum x_i over all restrictions that cover i.\n\n However, wait: that is not necessarily true. Consider two restrictions:\n   Restriction 1: [1,3] with x=2\n   Restriction 2: [2,4] with x=3\n\n Then for spot 2, we require that the maximum in [1,3] <= 2 and the maximum in [2,4] <= 3. \n But note that the restriction [1,3] forces spot2 to be <=2, and the restriction [2,4] forces spot2 to be <=3, so the tighter constraint is 2.\n\n Actually, yes: for each spot i, we must satisfy every restriction that covers i. For a given spot i, let M(i) be the minimum value among all x_j for which [l_j, r_j] covers i.\n\n Then the constraint for spot i is a_i <= M(i). However, note that M(i) might be negative? But x_i>=0, so okay.\n\n But wait: what if there is no restriction covering spot i? Then we don't have any explicit constraint from the restrictions, so we can use up to h.\n\n Therefore, for each spot i, the maximum allowed height is min(h, M(i))? Actually, we can set a_i up to min(h, M(i)).\n\n However, is that sufficient? Because the condition is on the entire interval. Even if we set each house independently to the minimum of the restrictions covering it, we must check that the maximum in each interval [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j.\n\n But note: if we set a_i = min(h, M(i)) for each i, then for a restriction j: \n   max_{i in [l_j, r_j]} a_i = max_{i in [l_j, r_j]} min(h, M(i))\n\n And we require that this maximum is <= x_j. But note: M(i) is defined as the minimum x_k for which i is in [l_k, r_k]. Therefore, for every i in [l_j, r_j], M(i) <= x_j (because the restriction j requires that i is <= x_j, and M(i) is the minimum of the x_k including j and possibly others that give even lower values). However, note that M(i) might be computed from other restrictions that are more restrictive. \n\n But actually, M(i) is the minimum x_k such that [l_k, r_k] covers i. And since j covers i, we have x_j is one of the values that goes into M(i). Therefore, M(i) <= x_j. Then a_i = min(h, M(i)) <= M(i) <= x_j. Then the maximum in the interval [l_j, r_j] is at most x_j. \n\n Therefore, the necessary condition for each spot i is that a_i <= min(h, M(i)), and if we set a_i to that value, then all restrictions are satisfied.\n\n Then the problem reduces to: for each spot i, set a_i = min(h, M(i)), and then the profit is sum_i (a_i)^2.\n\n However, wait: is that always optimal? Because maybe we can set a_i to a value lower than min(h, M(i)) and then set another house in the same interval to a higher value? \n\n Let me clarify: the condition is that in an interval [l_j, r_j] the maximum must be <= x_j. We are forced to set each house i to at most M(i) (which is the minimal x_j over the restrictions covering i). But note: we are free to set each house to any value between 0 and min(h, M(i)). \n\n However, the above reasoning about setting a_i = min(h, M(i)) is valid because if we set any house to more than M(i) then we break the restriction (since M(i) is the minimum x_j for which the house is included, so if we set a house to more than M(i) then there exists a restriction j (with x_j = M(i)) that requires the house to be <= M(i)). \n\n But wait: what if we set a house to a value lower than min(h, M(i))? Then we are still satisfying the condition, but we get less profit. Therefore, to maximize profit, we want to set each house to the maximum allowed, i.e., min(h, M(i)).\n\n However, let's test with the example:\n\n Example 1: n=3, h=3, m=3, restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n Compute M(i):\n   i=1: covered by [1,1,1] -> M(1)=1; then a1=1.\n   i=2: covered by [2,2,3] -> M(2)=3; then a2=3.\n   i=3: covered by [3,3,2] -> M(3)=2; then a3=2.\n\n Profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14. Matches.\n\n Example 2: n=4, h=10, m=2, restrictions: [2,3,8] and [3,4,7]\n\n Compute M(i):\n   i=1: no restriction -> M(1)=10 (since h=10) -> a1=10\n   i=2: covered by [2,3,8] -> M(2)=8 -> a2=8\n   i=3: covered by both [2,3,8] and [3,4,7] -> M(3)=min(8,7)=7 -> a3=7\n   i=4: covered by [3,4,7] -> M(4)=7 -> a4=7\n\n Profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262. Matches.\n\n But wait, why was the example output 262? \n\n However, let me check the second example with the provided input:\n\n Input: \n     4 10 2\n     2 3 8\n     3 4 7\n\n The example says: \n        In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights [10,8,7,7]\n\n So our method produces the same result.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n Step 1: For each spot i (from 1 to n), compute M(i) = minimum x_j for all restrictions j that cover i (if there are no restrictions covering i, then we use h, but note: the overall maximum is h, so we take min(h, ...) but actually we can set M(i) to a value at least h if there's no restriction? Actually, without any restriction, we are allowed up to h.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h.\" and the restrictions are additional. So without a restriction, the house can be up to h.\n\n So we can define:\n   M(i) = min{ h, (minimum x_j for which the restriction j covers i) }\n\n But wait: if there are no restrictions covering i, then the minimum x_j over an empty set? We should set M(i) to h in that case.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Let base = h for each spot.\n   Then for each restriction j, for each spot i in [l_j, r_j], update base[i] = min(base[i], x_j)\n\n Then set a_i = base[i] (because base[i] is the minimal allowed maximum in the restrictions that cover i, but note: we are taking the minimum x_j that covers i, and then we cannot exceed that, and also we cannot exceed h. However, we started with base[i]=h, and then we take min with x_j (which is <= h, because x_j is between 0 and h). So base[i] becomes the minimum between h and all x_j covering i? Actually, we are taking the minimum of h and the x_j's? But note: we are updating base[i] to be the minimum of the current base[i] (which is h) and x_j. Then if we have multiple restrictions, we take the minimum x_j.\n\n But wait: we start with base[i]=h, then for each restriction j that covers i, we set base[i] = min(base[i], x_j). Then base[i] will be the minimum x_j among the restrictions that cover i, but if no restriction covers i, base[i] remains h.\n\n However, we must ensure that base[i] is at most h. Since x_j <= h, the minimum x_j (if exists) is <= h, so base[i] is at most h.\n\n Then set a_i = base[i] (which is the maximum allowed for spot i) and then profit = sum(a_i^2)\n\n But wait: is that correct? \n\n Example: if we have two restrictions: one with x_j=5 and one with x_j=3, then base[i] becomes 3 (which is <=h). Then we set a_i=3, which is correct.\n\n However, note: the condition requires that the maximum in each interval is <= x_j. By setting each house to the minimum of the x_j's (and h) that cover it, we are ensuring that for each interval j, the maximum value in the interval is at most the minimum x_j that appears in that interval? Actually, no: consider an interval j that has a house i with base[i] = 3 (from a restriction k) and the interval j has x_j=5. Then the house i is set to 3, but there might be another house in the interval j that is set to 5 (if that house is only constrained by a restriction with x=5). Then the maximum in the interval j would be 5, which is allowed (since 5<=5). \n\n But wait, how did we set the other house? For the other house, we set it to the minimum x_j that covers it. So if the other house is only constrained by a restriction that allows up to 5, then we set it to 5. Then the interval j has two houses: one set to 3 and one set to 5. The maximum is 5, which is <=5. \n\n Now, what if there is a restriction j with x_j=5 and the house i is set to 3 (because of a more restrictive restriction) and the house k in the same interval j is set to 5 (because of a less restrictive one). Then the maximum is 5, which is acceptable.\n\n But note: the condition for the entire interval j is that the maximum is <=5. So we are safe.\n\n However, our method sets each house to the minimum of the restrictions that apply to it. This might lead to a house being set too low, but that doesn't break the condition. But is that the best we can do? \n\n Actually, no: we might set a house to a lower value than the minimum x_j that covers it, but then we could set another house in the same interval to a higher value (up to the minimum x_j that covers it for that other house). However, note that the condition for the entire interval is just that the maximum is <= x_j. So if we set one house to a lower value, we can set another house to a higher value (but not exceeding the restrictions that cover it). \n\n But wait: the profit function is the sum of squares. The square function is convex, so we want to set each house as high as possible to maximize the profit. \n\n Therefore, the optimal is to set each house to the maximum allowed by the restrictions that cover it, i.e., base[i] = min(h, min_{j covering i} x_j) [but note: we are already starting from h and then taking the min with the x_j's, so base[i] is exactly that].\n\n However, wait: what if two restrictions overlap and one is more restrictive than the other? Our method takes the minimum x_j, so that's correct.\n\n But let me test with an example:\n\n Example 3: \n   n=2, h=10\n   Restrictions: \n        [1,2,5]   -> the entire street must have max <=5\n        [1,1,3]   -> the first house must be <=3\n\n Then for house1: \n        base[1] = min(10, 5, 3) = 3\n   for house2:\n        base[2] = min(10,5) = 5\n\n Then profit = 3^2 + 5^2 = 9+25=34.\n\n But wait, is that the maximum? \n        House1: must be <=3, house2: must be <=5 (because of the first restriction) and also the entire street must be <=5 (so house2<=5). \n        However, note: the condition for house2 is that the entire street [1,2] must be <=5. But house1 is 3, which is <=5, so house2 can be 5. \n\n        So the assignment [3,5] is valid and yields 34.\n\n        What if we set house1 to 3 and house2 to 5: that's the maximum.\n\n Example 4: \n   n=2, h=10\n   Restrictions:\n        [1,2,5]   -> entire street <=5\n        [2,2,3]   -> house2 <=3\n\n   Then house1: base[1] = min(10,5) = 5\n        house2: base[2] = min(10,5,3) = 3\n\n   Profit = 5^2+3^2 = 25+9=34.\n\n   But wait: the entire street must be <=5, and house1 is 5, house2 is 3 -> maximum is 5, which is okay.\n\n Example 5: \n   n=2, h=10\n   Restrictions:\n        [1,2,5]   -> entire street <=5\n        [1,1,4]   -> house1 <=4\n\n   Then house1: min(10,5,4)=4\n        house2: min(10,5)=5\n\n   Profit = 16+25=41.\n\n   But wait: the entire street must be <=5, and house1=4 and house2=5 -> maximum is 5, okay.\n\n   And we cannot set house2 to more than 5, and house1 to more than 4.\n\n So the method seems to work.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read n, h, m.\n   Initialize an array base of length n (for spots 1 to n) with h.\n\n   For each of the m restrictions:\n        Read l, r, x.\n        For i from l-1 to r-1 (0-indexed) in the base array:\n            base[i] = min(base[i], x)\n\n   Then, for each spot i, set a_i = base[i] (the maximum allowed for that spot).\n\n   Then, profit = sum(a_i^2 for i in range(n))\n\n   Print profit.\n\n But wait: is it really that simple? \n\n Let me check with the sample inputs:\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        base = [3,3,3]\n        Restriction1: [1,1,1] -> update base[0] = min(3,1) -> 1\n        Restriction2: [2,2,3] -> update base[1] = min(3,3) -> 3\n        Restriction3: [3,3,2] -> update base[2] = min(3,2) -> 2\n        Profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n   Example 2:\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        base = [10,10,10,10]\n        Restriction1: [2,3,8] -> update indices 1 and 2: \n            base[1]=min(10,8)=8, base[2]=min(10,8)=8\n        Restriction2: [3,4,7] -> update indices 2 and 3:\n            base[2]=min(8,7)=7, base[3]=min(10,7)=7\n        Profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49=262.\n\n   Both examples match.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the restrictions are given and we must satisfy them. Our method ensures that for each restriction j, for every house i in [l_j, r_j], base[i] <= x_j (because we updated base[i] with x_j and then took min). Therefore, the maximum in the interval [l_j, r_j] is at most x_j (because every house in the interval is <= x_j, so the maximum is <= x_j). \n\n But wait, is that true? We set each house i to base[i] (which is the minimum of all x_j' for which i is covered). Then for a restriction j, the house i in [l_j, r_j] has base[i] <= x_j (by the update). Therefore, the maximum in the interval is <= x_j.\n\n However, note: it is possible that the minimum x_j for which i is covered is not necessarily the same as the x_j of the restriction j. But that doesn't matter: we are only concerned with the condition for j: that the maximum in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j. Since every house in [l_j, r_j] is set to a value <= x_j (because base[i] <= x_j for each i in [l_j, r_j]), the maximum is <= x_j.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   base = [h] * n\n   for _ in range(m):\n        data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        l, r, x = data\n        # Convert l, r to 0-indexed: the houses are from index l-1 to r-1.\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x < base[i]:\n                base[i] = x\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        total += base[i] * base[i]\n\n   print(total)\n\n But wait: is it correct to set base[i] to the minimum x_j that covers i? Yes, because we are updating base[i] to be the minimum of all x_j that cover i and the initial h. And then we set the house to that value.\n\n However, note: the above update does not take the minimum over all x_j, because we are doing:\n\n        base[i] = min(base[i], x)\n\n and initially base[i] is h. Then we update with each x_j that covers i. This indeed gives the minimum x_j (if any) or h if none.\n\n But wait: what if we have two restrictions: one with x=5 and one with x=3. Then after the first update: base[i] becomes 5, then the second update: base[i] becomes min(5,3)=3. That is the minimum.\n\n So the code above is correct.\n\n However, let me test with an example that has multiple restrictions:\n\n Example 6: \n        n=1, h=10, m=2\n        Restrictions: [1,1,5] and [1,1,3]\n\n        base = [10]\n        First restriction: base[0] = min(10,5) -> 5\n        Second restriction: base[0] = min(5,3) -> 3\n\n        Then profit = 3^2 = 9.\n\n Example 7: \n        n=2, h=10, m=3\n        Restrictions: [1,2,5], [1,1,3], [2,2,4]\n\n        base = [10,10]\n        Restriction1: [1,2,5] -> update [0,1]: base[0]=min(10,5)=5, base[1]=min(10,5)=5\n        Restriction2: [1,1,3] -> update [0]: base[0]=min(5,3)=3\n        Restriction3: [2,2,4] -> update [1]: base[1]=min(5,4)=4\n\n        Then profit = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9+16=25.\n\n        Check conditions:\n            Entire street (restriction1): max(3,4)=4 <=5 -> ok.\n            House1 (restriction2): 3<=3 -> ok.\n            House2 (restriction3): 4<=4 -> ok.\n\n        Is there a better assignment? \n            House1: must be <=3 (from restriction2) and <=5 (from restriction1) -> so 3 is the maximum for house1.\n            House2: must be <=4 (from restriction3) and <=5 (from restriction1) -> so 4 is the maximum for house2.\n\n        So 25 is indeed the maximum.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   base = [h] * n\n   for i in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n        for j in range(l-1, r):\n            if x < base[j]:\n                base[j] = x\n\n   total = 0\n   for num in base:\n        total += num * num\n\n   print(total)\n\nHowever, wait: the problem says the first example input is given as:\n\n   ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nBut note: the example input has two separate test cases. How do we handle multiple test cases?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the input format.\n\nActually, the problem statement says:\n\n   Input:\n      The first line contains three integers n, h, m ...\n      Each of the next m lines ...\n\nThis suggests that there is one test case.\n\nBut the example input is given as a list with two strings. This might be because the problem is providing two examples.\n\nBut the problem says: \"You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\"\n\nAnd the example input is provided as two separate examples.\n\nWait, the example input is provided as:\n\n   ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nBut note: the example output is:\n\n   ['14', '262']\n\nSo the problem expects two separate runs? Or is it a single input that includes two test cases?\n\nLooking at the problem statement: the input format is fixed. It says the first line is n, h, m and then m lines.\n\nBut the example input is two separate strings. \n\nIn competitive programming, typically one test case is provided per run.\n\nBut the example input is given as two examples. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format. It doesn't specify multiple test cases.\n\nHowever, the example input is provided as two separate strings. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Print a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\"\n\nAnd the example output is two integers.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"Determine the maximum profit possible.\" for the given input.\n\nIt seems that the example input has two test cases. But the problem does not specify that there are multiple test cases.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m ...\"\n\nSo we assume one test case per run.\n\nBut the example input is provided as two separate test cases in the same string? \n\nActually, the example input is given as:\n\n   ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nThis is just two examples. \n\nBut the problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nAnd the example input is provided as two separate test cases. \n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the problem statement. \n\nIn many competitions, problems can have multiple test cases. However, the problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\nLooking at the constraints: n, m, h are up to 50. \n\nBut the input format says: \n   First line: n, h, m\n   Then m lines.\n\nThis implies one test case.\n\nBut the example input is two separate test cases. \n\nI think the example input provided in the note is two separate examples. \n\nBut the problem does not say anything about multiple test cases. \n\nTherefore, we assume one test case.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says: \"Each of the next m lines\", meaning one test case.\n\nBut wait: the example input is given as:\n\n   Input: \n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nBut note: this is probably just two examples. \n\nBut the problem says: \"Print a single integer\"\n\nSo we output one integer per test case.\n\nBut if we are to write a program that reads from stdin, then we must read until EOF (end of file) if there are multiple test cases? \n\nBut the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be designed to have multiple test cases, but the constraints say n, m, h up to 50, and m is the number of restrictions for the test case.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m\" for one test case.\n\nBut if we are to process multiple test cases, the input would look like:\n\n   n h m\n   l1 r1 x1\n   ...\n   lm r1 x1\n   n h m\n   ...\n\nHow many test cases? The problem does not say.\n\nBut the example input only provides one test case per string.\n\nI think the problem intended to provide one test case. \n\nHowever, looking at the example input format in the problem statement, it is:\n\n   Input:\n        3 3 3\n        1 1 1\n        2 2 3\n        3 3 2\n\n   Output:\n        14\n\n   and\n\n        4 10 2\n        2 3 8\n        3 4 7\n\n   Output:\n        262\n\nBut the problem does not specify if there are multiple test cases.\n\nSince the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input format, and the constraints, we must assume that the input is one test case.\n\nBut wait, the example input is provided as two separate strings. \n\nI think the example input is just two examples. \n\nBut the problem says: \"You are planning to build housing on a street.\" and then the input. \n\nIn summary, we'll assume one test case.\n\nHowever, let me check the problem statement: \"There are $$$n$$$ spots available ... There are $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions.\" \n\nIt says \"There are\", meaning one set of restrictions.\n\nTherefore, we write the code for one test case.\n\nBut wait, the example input is two separate test cases. \n\nActually, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the problem statement, but then the example input is given as two examples.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Print a single integer\".\n\nSo we output one integer.\n\nBut the example input has two test cases. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"Determine the maximum profit possible.\" for the given input.\n\nWe must assume that the input is one test case.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\nSince the constraints are small, and the input format is fixed (first line n, h, m), then we read one test case.\n\nIf the competition provides multiple test cases, they would be separated by the above format.\n\nBut the problem says: \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m\", meaning one test case.\n\nHowever, the example input is provided as two separate strings. \n\nBut note: the example input is given in the problem as:\n\n   ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nThis is just two examples. \n\nWe'll write the code for one test case.\n\nBut wait, what if the input has multiple test cases? The problem does not specify.\n\nBut the problem constraints say n, h, m up to 50, and m is the number of restrictions for the test case.\n\nIn many problems, if there are multiple test cases, the first line is the number of test cases.\n\nBut here, the first line is n, h, m.\n\nSo we assume one test case.\n\nBut the example input has two test cases. \n\nThis suggests that the problem might be designed to have multiple test cases, but the example input is provided separately.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the problem statement, and then the example input is provided as two strings.\n\nBut note: the problem statement does not say that there are multiple test cases. \n\nAfter re‐reading the problem statement: it says \"The first line contains three integers n, h, m\" and then \"Each of the next m lines\". \n\nThis is the standard format for one test case.\n\nTherefore, we assume one test case.\n\nBut wait, the example input is two separate test cases. \n\nThis might be an error in the problem statement.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above\", meaning the problem described.\n\nIn the problem described, there is one test case.\n\nSo we output one integer.\n\nBut the example input is two test cases. \n\nI think the problem intended to show two examples, but the actual input in the competition system will have one test case per input.\n\nSo we write the code for one test case.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says: \"Print a single integer\"\n\nAnd the example output is two integers, but that is because they showed two examples.\n\nWe'll assume that the input is one test case.\n\nCode:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   base = [h] * n\n   for _ in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            continue\n        l = int(data[0])\n        r = int(data[1])\n        x_val = int(data[2])\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < base[i]:\n                base[i] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for num in base:\n        total += num * num\n\n   print(total)\n\nBut wait: the example input is given as a string with newline characters. We are reading one test case.\n\nHowever, the example input is provided as two separate strings. \n\nBut in the competition, the input will be one test case.\n\nLet me run the code with the first example:\n\n   Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n   n=3, h=3, m=3\n   base = [3,3,3]\n   Process first restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1 -> update base[0]=min(3,1)=1\n   Process second: l=2, r=2, x=3 -> update base[1]=min(3,3)=3\n   Process third: l=3, r=3, x=2 -> update base[2]=min(3,2)=2\n   Then total = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4=14.\n\n   Output: 14.\n\nSecond example:\n\n   Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n   n=4, h=10, m=2\n   base=[10,10,10,10]\n   First restriction: l=2, r=3, x=8 -> update base[1] and base[2] to 8 -> [10,8,8,10]\n   Second restriction: l=3, r=4, x=7 -> update base[2] and base[3]: \n        base[2]=min(8,7)=7, base[3]=min(10,7)=7 -> [10,8,7,7]\n   Total = 10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 100+64+49+49=262.\n\n   Output: 262.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But note: the problem says that the maximum height is h, and the restrictions are given with x_i between 0 and h.\n\n One edge: if x_i is 0, then we set the house to 0. Then profit is 0 for that house.\n\n Example: \n        n=1, h=10, m=1, restriction: [1,1,0] -> base[0]=0, profit=0.\n\n This is correct.\n\n Another edge: no restrictions. Then base remains [h] * n, and profit = n * h^2.\n\n Example: n=1, h=10, m=0 -> base=[10], profit=100.\n\n But wait, the input format: if m=0, then we don't read any restrictions.\n\n The code uses for _ in range(m): so if m=0, the loop is skipped.\n\n This is correct.\n\n Therefore, we are done.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the restrictions are given and the spots are labeled from 1 to n. Our indexing is 0-indexed, but we convert the given l, r to 0-indexed by using l-1 to r-1.\n\n But note: the input l and r are inclusive, and our loop from l-1 to r- (meaning we go from l-1 to r-1, so we do r - (l-1) iterations). \n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n\n But note: if r is 3, then we go from l-1 to 2 (inclusive). That is correct.\n\n However, note: the input says the restriction covers [l_i, r_i] inclusive, so the last index is r_i-1.\n\n But wait: our loop is:\n\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n\n This means i goes from l-1 to r-1 (because range(a, b) goes from a to b-1). \n\n Example: l=2, r=3 -> i from 1 to 2 (exclusive of 3) -> i=1 and i=2? Actually, no: in Python, range(a, b) goes from a to b-1.\n\n        l",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The key challenge is to ensure that the heights of the houses comply with all given restrictions, which specify that the tallest house in certain intervals must not exceed a specified height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves assigning heights to houses such that each house's height does not violate any zoning restrictions. Each restriction requires that the maximum height in a specified interval (from `l_i` to `r_i`) does not exceed `x_i`. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of the house heights while respecting all these constraints.\n2. **Insight**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive restriction that includes it. This means for each house at position `i`, the height should be the minimum value between the global maximum height `h` and the smallest `x_i` from all restrictions that include position `i`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We initialize an array `base` where each element is set to the global maximum height `h`. For each restriction, we update the corresponding elements in the `base` array to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's height `x_i`. After processing all restrictions, each element in `base` holds the maximum allowable height for its respective house.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction and updates the relevant positions in the `base` array. With `n` houses and `m` restrictions, each restriction can affect up to `n` houses, leading to a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n, h, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    base = [h] * n\n    \n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(m):\n        parts = data[index].split()\n        index += 1\n        l = int(parts[0])\n        r = int(parts[1])\n        x_val = int(parts[2])\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < base[i]:\n                base[i] = x_val\n                \n    total = 0\n    for num in base:\n        total += num * num\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the small constraints. The first line contains the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `base` is initialized with `n` elements, each set to the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the `base` array. Specifically, for each house within the specified interval `[l_i, r_i]`, the code sets the house's maximum allowable height to the minimum between its current value and the restriction's height `x_i`.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is computed by summing the squares of the values in the `base` array, which now contains the optimal heights for each house that maximize profit while respecting all restrictions.\n5. **Output**: The computed profit is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all constraints are met while maximizing the profit by leveraging the properties of convex functions (squares) and straightforward array operations.",
