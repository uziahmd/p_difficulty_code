Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\nWe are given:\n  - n and x (the number of found cards and the maximum absolute value on any card)\n  - a list of n integers (each between -x and x)\n\nWe can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x.\n\nGoal: We want to find the minimum number of additional cards (from the infinite set) such that the total sum of all the numbers (found and additional) is zero.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n2. We need to add some cards (each card can be any integer in [-x, x]) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n\nLet T be the sum we need to add: T = -S.\n\nNow, we have to cover T by adding as few cards as possible, where each card can contribute any integer between -x and x.\n\nNote: We are allowed to use any integer from -x to x arbitrarily many times.\n\nThis is similar to a coin change problem but with the following:\n  - The available \"coins\" are integers in [-x, x] (so we can use negative numbers too).\n  - We want to represent T (which might be positive or negative) as a sum of k integers, each in [-x, x], and we want the minimum k.\n\nHowever, note that we can also think about it symmetrically: since we can use negative and positive numbers arbitrarily, the problem reduces to:\n\n  We wish to write T as a sum of k integers, each between -x and x.\n\nBut note: We are allowed to use any integer in that range, so we can even use zeros. However, zeros don't help. So effectively, we are looking for the smallest k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each in [-x, x]) with a1+a2+...+ak = T.\n\nConstraints on k:\n\n- The maximum absolute value we can get from k cards is k*x (if we take all x's or all -x's). So we must have |T| <= k*x.\n\nBut is that sufficient? Also, note that we can mix positive and negative. Actually, the necessary and sufficient condition is that k >= ceil(|T| / x) because the maximum absolute value per card is x. However, we must consider if we can achieve T exactly?\n\nActually, we can always achieve T if k >= ceil(|T|/x) because:\n\n  Let d = T // k, but wait. Alternatively, consider:\n\n  We can use the following greedy: \n\n  But note: We are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. \n\n  However, there is a catch: we cannot exceed the range of each card.\n\n  Actually, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that:\n      k * x >= |T|\n\n  Why? Because if we take k cards, the maximum absolute value we can represent is k*x. So we need at least |T| <= k*x.\n\n  But is that sufficient? \n\n  Example: T = 5, x=2, k=3 -> 3*2=6 >=5 -> then we can form 5? \n      We can do: 2+2+1 -> but wait, 1 is allowed (since 1<=2). But wait, the card must be an integer in [-2,2]. So 1 is allowed.\n\n  However, what if T is negative? Same.\n\n  But consider: T=5, x=2, k=3: we can do 2+2+1=5. Similarly, T=-5: -2-2-1=-5.\n\n  What if T=4, x=2, k=2: 2+2=4 -> yes.\n\n  What if T=3, x=2, k=2: 2+1=3 -> yes.\n\n  What if T=1, x=2, k=1: 1 is in [-2,2] -> yes.\n\n  However, what if T=0? Then k=0, but we already have the sum S=0, so we don't need any card. But wait, our T is defined as -S, so if S=0 then T=0, then k=0.\n\nBut wait, is k=0 acceptable? Yes, because if the current sum is already zero, we don't need any card.\n\nHowever, note: we are allowed to choose any integer from [-x,x] for each card. So if we need to form T, we require:\n\n  k_min = ceil(|T| / x)   ?\n\nBut wait, is that always sufficient? \n\n  Example: T=5, x=2 -> ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3 -> which works.\n\n  Example: T=6, x=2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards becomes zero. The solution involves calculating the current sum of the found cards and then determining the smallest number of cards required to balance this sum to zero using cards with values between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum is the negative of the current sum, which when added to the current sum will result in zero.\n3. **Find Minimum Cards**: The key insight here is that each additional card can contribute any integer value between -x and x. The minimal number of cards needed is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by x. This is because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) towards balancing the sum. \n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    target = -total_sum\n    \n    if target == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_target = abs(target)\n        k = (abs_target + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum is set to the negative of this sum to balance it to zero.\n3. **Handling Zero Target**: If the target sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed, so the answer is zero.\n4. **Calculating Minimum Cards**: For a non-zero target sum, the minimal number of cards required is calculated by taking the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by `x`. This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations. The formula `(abs_target + x - 1) // x` effectively computes the ceiling of `abs_target / x`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal number of cards needed by leveraging simple arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
