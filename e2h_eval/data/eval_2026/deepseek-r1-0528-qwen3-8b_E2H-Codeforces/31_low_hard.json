Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\nWe are given:\n  - n and x (the number of found cards and the maximum absolute value on any card)\n  - a list of n integers (each between -x and x)\n\nWe can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x.\n\nGoal: We want to find the minimum number of additional cards so that the total sum is zero.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Calculate the current sum of the found cards.\n2. We need to add some cards (each with an integer in [-x, x]) such that the total sum becomes zero.\n\nLet S be the current sum. Then we need to achieve a target sum of 0, so we need to cover the deficit (or surplus) of -S.\n\nBut note: we can use any integer in the range [-x, x] for each additional card.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to use as many cards as we want (but we want the minimum number). \n\nObservation:\n\nLet T = -S (the amount we need to add to make the total zero).\n\nNow, we are allowed to add numbers from -x to x. But note: we are free to choose any integers in that range. So we can think of the problem as: what is the minimum number k such that we can represent T as the sum of k numbers, each in [-x, x]?\n\nBut note: if T is positive, then we can only use positive numbers (if we don't want negative ones) or both? Actually, we can use negative numbers too. However, using negative numbers would require even more positive numbers to compensate, so it might not be optimal. Similarly, if T is negative, we can use negative numbers.\n\nBut wait, the problem does not restrict the sign. However, to minimize the number of cards, we would like to use the largest absolute value that we can. However, note:\n\n- If we are to achieve a positive T, we can use positive numbers (from 1 to x) and avoid negative numbers because that would require even more positive ones. Similarly, for negative T, use negative numbers.\n\nBut actually, we can mix positive and negative? However, that might not help in minimizing the number of cards. For example, if we have to add 5, and x=3, then:\n  Option 1: two cards: 3 and 2 -> 5 (two cards)\n  Option 2: one card: 5? but 5>3 so not allowed.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the absolute value doesn't exceed x, so the maximum absolute value is x. Therefore, we cannot use a card larger than x.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: Represent T (which could be positive or negative) as the sum of k numbers, each in the range [-x, x], and we want the minimum k.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use zeros as well. However, zeros don't help in achieving the target T (unless T=0, then we don't need any card). \n\nLet me consider:\n\nCase 1: T = 0 -> then we don't need any card.\n\nCase 2: T != 0.\n\nWe can also note that we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. Therefore, the set of achievable sums with k cards is the set of integers between -k*x and k*x, but also constrained by the fact that we can only form certain sums.\n\nActually, with k cards, the minimum sum we can get is -k*x, and the maximum is k*x. Moreover, we can form every integer between -k*x and k*x? Not exactly: for example, with k=1, we can form every integer from -x to x. With k=2, we can form every integer from -2*x to 2*x? Actually, no: for k=2, we can form every integer from -2*x to 2*x because we can adjust by 1 if x>=1? Let me check:\n\nFor k=2, the set is {a+b | a in [-x,x], b in [-x,x]}. The minimum is -2*x, the maximum is 2*x, and the step is 1. Why? Because if we fix a, then b can vary by 1. So yes, for k>=1, we can form every integer from -k*x to k*x.\n\nWait, is that true for k=2? \n  The smallest is -2*x, then -2*x+1, -2*x+2, ... up to 2*x.\n\nBut note: we can choose any integers. So yes, because we can change by 1. So the entire interval [-k*x, k*x] is covered.\n\nTherefore, if |T| <= k*x, then we can achieve T with k cards.\n\nBut we want the minimum k.\n\nSo we are looking for the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards equals zero. The solution involves calculating the current sum of the found cards and then determining the smallest number of cards required to balance this sum to zero using cards with values between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Adjustment**: The target is to make the total sum zero, so the adjustment needed is the negative of the current sum (i.e., `-current_sum`).\n3. **Check for Zero Adjustment**: If the adjustment needed is zero, no additional cards are required.\n4. **Binary Search for Minimum Cards**: For non-zero adjustments, use binary search to find the smallest number of cards (k) such that the absolute value of the adjustment is within the range `[-k*x, k*x]`. This is because each card can contribute a value between -x and x, so the maximum absolute sum achievable with k cards is k*x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(cards)\n    target = -total\n    \n    if target == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    low = 1\n    high = abs(target) * 2 + 100  # Safe upper bound\n    \n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        max_abs = mid * x\n        if abs(target) <= max_abs:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n            \n    print(low)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers (n and x) followed by a list of n integers representing the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target adjustment needed to make this sum zero is the negative of this sum.\n3. **Zero Adjustment Check**: If the target adjustment is zero, the answer is immediately zero since no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is initialized with `low` set to 1 and `high` set to a sufficiently large value (to ensure coverage).\n5. **Binary Search Execution**: For each midpoint in the search range, the algorithm checks if the absolute value of the target adjustment can be achieved with the current number of cards (mid). The search adjusts the bounds based on whether the adjustment is feasible.\n6. **Output Result**: The smallest number of cards (k) found during the binary search is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution space using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
