Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: x + y > z.\n\n Since the sides are constrained by ranges, we can use the following approach:\n\n Let:\n   x in [A, B]\n   y in [B, C]   (Note: since B<=C, and also note that the condition is B<=y<=C)\n   z in [C, D]\n\n However, note that the problem states: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\n Therefore, we have three independent intervals.\n\n But note: the condition for a triangle is x+y>z. Since x<=B, y<=C, and z>=C, and also note that x<=y<=z (because x<=B<=y and y<=C<=z), \n the most restrictive part is that z must be less than x+y. Since x is at least A and y at least B, but also note that z must be at least C.\n\n So, we require for each (x,y): z must satisfy max(C, x+y-? ) but actually the condition is z < x+y. Since z is an integer, we require z <= x+y-1.\n\n However, note that the triangle condition is strict: x+y>z => z < x+y.\n\n Also note that z must be in [C, D]. So for fixed x and y, the valid z are from C to min(D, x+y-1). But if x+y-1 < C, then there's no valid z.\n\n But wait: we cannot iterate over all x from A to B and y from B to C because A, B, C, D can be up to 500000. The total pairs could be (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be about 2.5e10 or more, too many.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can fix z and count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and also note that we require y>=B and x<=B and y<=C and z>=C.\n\n However, note: the condition on y is that y>=B and y<=C, and x>=A and x<=B.\n\n But note: the condition x+y>z can be broken down by fixing x and then y must be > z-x. But again, iterating over x and then y is too expensive.\n\n Another idea: use two pointers or precomputation of prefix sums.\n\n Let F(x,y) = 1 if x+y > z else 0, but we want to sum over x and y for each z? Actually, we can think:\n\n Total triangles = Sum_{x=A}^{B} Sum_{y=B}^{C} max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)   [if x+y-1 >= C, otherwise 0]\n\n But wait, that counts the number of z for each (x,y). However, we cannot do two nested loops.\n\n Instead, we can swap the order: for fixed x, what are the y and z? \n\n Alternatively, let's fix x and y and then count the z. But that is too slow.\n\n We can fix the side z and count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, but then we must also ensure that x<=B, y<=C, and note that x>=A, y>=B.\n\n But note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, and we know that x<=B, y<=C, so for a fixed z, we require x+y>z.\n\n We can precompute the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y>k, for k from (A+B) to (B+C) (or beyond) but note that z goes from C to D, and k=z.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute for each k (from some lower bound to upper bound) the number of pairs (x,y) with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C] such that x+y>k.\n\n 2. Then the answer is: for each z from C to D, add the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z and then take the z range [C, D] but note that for each pair (x,y) we can only have z from max(C, x+y) to D? Actually, we have to be careful.\n\n But wait: we can also think:\n\n   For a fixed (x,y): the condition is z < x+y. So for each (x,y), the number of z is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) provided that x+y-",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we need an efficient method to count the valid triangles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Given the constraints \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\), the most restrictive condition is \\(x + y > z\\). This is because \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\) implies that \\(x + z > y\\) and \\(y + z > x\\) are automatically satisfied if \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Efficient Counting**: Instead of iterating over all possible combinations of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), we can fix \\(z\\) and count the pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). For each \\(z\\) in the range \\([C, D]\\), the valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) must satisfy \\(x \\in [A, B]\\), \\(y \\in [B, C]\\), and \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n3. **Mathematical Formulation**: For each \\(z\\), the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) is determined by how many \\(x\\) values in \\([A, B]\\) allow \\(y\\) to be in \\([B, C]\\) such that \\(y > z - x\\). This can be rephrased as \\(y > \\max(B, z - x)\\). The upper bound for \\(y\\) is \\(C\\), so the valid \\(y\\) values start from \\(\\max(B, z - x + 1)\\) to \\(C\\).\n\n4. **Prefix Sum Optimization**: To avoid nested loops, we precompute the prefix sums of the counts of \\(x\\) values. This allows us to quickly determine the number of \\(x\\) values that satisfy the condition for each \\(z\\) by using binary search or direct array access.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    n = B - A + 1\n    arr = [0] * (D + 1)\n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        arr[x] += 1\n    \n    prefix = [0] * (D + 1)\n    prefix[A] = 1\n    for i in range(A + 1, D + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + (1 if i >= A and i <= B else 0)\n    \n    total = 0\n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        low_y = B\n        high_y = C\n        if z < B + A:\n            min_y = max(B, z - B + 1)\n            if min_y <= C:\n                count_x = prefix[B] - prefix[A - 1]\n                min_y_val = max(B, z - B + 1)\n                max_y_val = C\n                if min_y_val <= max_y_val:\n                    total += (min_y_val - B + 1) * count_x\n        else:\n            min_y = max(B, z - B + 1)\n            if min_y <= C:\n                count_x = prefix[B] - prefix[z - min_y] if z - min_y >= A else (B - A + 1)\n                if count_x <= 0:\n                    continue\n                min_y_val = max(B, z - B + 1)\n                max_y_val = C\n                if min_y_val <= max_y_val:\n                    total += (min_y_val - B + 1) * count_x\n            else:\n                total += 0\n                \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n2. **Prefix Array Setup**: We create a prefix array where each entry at index \\(i\\) holds the count of numbers from \\(A\\) to \\(i\\) that fall within the range \\([A, B]\\). This helps in quickly determining how many valid \\(x\\) values exist for any given \\(z\\).\n3. **Counting Valid Triangles**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), we determine the minimum \\(y\\) value required such that \\(x + y > z\\) for some \\(x\\) in \\([A, B]\\). Using the prefix array, we efficiently count the number of valid \\(x\\) values that can pair with \\(y\\) to satisfy the triangle condition.\n4. **Output the Result**: The total count of valid triangles is printed after processing all possible \\(z\\) values.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem by leveraging mathematical insights and prefix sums to avoid brute-force counting, making it feasible even for large input sizes.",
