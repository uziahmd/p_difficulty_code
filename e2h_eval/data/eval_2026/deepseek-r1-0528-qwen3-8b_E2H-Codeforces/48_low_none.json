He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000). The number is guaranteed to be representable.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given base-a string `c` to an integer in base 10. But note: the base a might be greater than 10, and the digits can be represented by digits and letters (from 'A' onward for digits above 9). However, the input string `c` is given in base a, so each digit is from 0 to a-1.\n\n    How to convert?\n        We can traverse the string and for each character:\n          - If the character is a digit, its value is int(char)\n          - If the character is a letter, then its value is 10 + (letter - 'A') [but note: the problem says that in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.]\n\n    However, note: the base a is at most 25, so we don't have to worry about base beyond 36.\n\n    Example: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base 12, so A represents 10. Then we convert \"A\" from base 12 to base 10: 10 (in base 12) is 10*12^0 = 10.\n\n 2. Now, if b is an integer (not 'R'):\n        Convert the base-10 integer to base b (which is between 2 and 25). We have to represent the digits: for base b, the digits go from 0 to b-1. We use:\n            '0' to '9' for 0 to 9, then 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11, ... up to the required.\n\n    But note: the problem says the output must not have leading zeros. So if the number is 0, then output \"0\". Otherwise, we output the digits without leading zeros.\n\n 3. If b is 'R':\n        We have to convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral. The number is guaranteed to be at most 300010 and not 0.\n\n    Conversion to Roman numerals involves using the standard rules (additive and subtractive). We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n    Steps for converting an integer to Roman numeral:\n        We can define the mapping for the symbols:\n\n        M = 1000, CM = 900, D = 500, CD = 400, C = 100, XC = 90, L = 50, XL = 40, X = 10, IX = 9, V = 5, IV = 4, I = 1.\n\n        Then, we can iterate from the largest symbol to smallest, and for each symbol, while the current value is >= the symbol, subtract the symbol's value and append the corresponding string.\n\n        Example: 1994 -> MCMXCIV\n\n        But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010. So we need to handle up to 300010.\n\n        However, note that the standard Roman numerals don't have a symbol for 5000 or more. But the problem states that the number is at most 300010, so we can use the standard representation with M (1000) repeated up to 300 times (for 300000). But wait, 300000 is MMM followed by CC? Actually, no: 300000 is three hundred thousands, which in Roman numerals is represented as \"C\" for 100,000? Actually, no, the classical Roman numerals only go up to 3999. \n\n        According to the problem statement, they extend the system to bases greater than 10, but for the Roman numeral system, they use the standard symbols and subtractive principle. Also, the example includes numbers up to 300010.\n\n        Let me check the example: 5 -> V, 4 -> IV.\n\n        The problem does not specify an extended system for large numbers (like using a bar for thousands), but note that 300010 is 300,01",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, which could either be a standard base or a Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, then converting it to the desired output base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input String to Base 10**: The input number is provided as a string in base `a`. Each character in the string represents a digit in base `a`. For digits greater than 9, letters are used (e.g., 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11, etc.). We process each character to compute its decimal value.\n2. **Convert Base 10 to Output Base**: If the target base `b` is an integer, we convert the decimal number to base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (0-9, A-Z).\n3. **Convert Base 10 to Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', we convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a systematic approach. This involves breaking down the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, then mapping each segment to its Roman numeral equivalent using predefined values and subtractive rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    a = int(a_str)\n    try:\n        b = int(b_str)\n    except ValueError:\n        b = 'R'\n\n    def convert_to_base_10(s, base):\n        value = 0\n        length = len(s)\n        for i, char in enumerate(s):\n            digit_val = int(char) if char.isdigit() else (ord(char) - ord('A') + 10)\n            if digit_val >= base:\n                raise ValueError(\"Digit not allowed in base {}\".format(base))\n            value += digit_val * (base ** (length - i - 1))\n        return value\n\n    try:\n        num = convert_to_base_10(num_str, a)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        if num == 0:\n            print(\"\")\n            return\n            \n        roman_numerals = [\n            ('M', 1000),\n            ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400), ('C', 100),\n            ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40), ('X', 10),\n            ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n        ]\n        \n        res = []\n        for numeral, value in roman_numerals:\n            while num >= value:\n                res.append(numeral)\n                num -= value\n        print(''.join(res))\n    else:\n        if num == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        digits = []\n        n = num\n        while n:\n            r = n % b\n            n = n // b\n            digits.append(r)\n            \n        digits.reverse()\n        out_str = ''\n        for digit in digits:\n            if digit < 10:\n                out_str += str(digit)\n            else:\n                out_str += chr(ord('A') + digit - 10)\n        print(out_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two parts: the base conversion parameters (`a` and `b`) and the number string in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The function `convert_to_base_10` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its decimal value based on its position and the given base. For example, the string \"10\" in base 2 is converted to 2 in decimal.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Standard Base Conversion**: If `b` is an integer, the decimal number is converted back to base `b` by repeatedly dividing by `b` and collecting remainders. The remainders are then mapped to their respective digits (0-9, A-Z).\n   - **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If `b` is 'R', the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values (like 1000, 900, etc.) from the number until it reaches zero. The corresponding symbols are appended to the result string.\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases such as zero input and invalid digits in the input string, ensuring robustness and correctness. Leading zeros are omitted in the output.",
