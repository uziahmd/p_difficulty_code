Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n (number of vertices) and a (the target angle in degrees)\n\n In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n\n We are to choose three distinct vertices (v1, v2, v3) such that the angle at v2 (with sides from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3) is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n Note: The polygon is regular and convex, and the vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n How to think:\n\n The angle at vertex v2 can be computed by considering the arcs between the vertices. However, note that the problem does not require the central angles but the angle formed by three points (like in circle geometry). \n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the entire circle is 360 degrees. The angle at a vertex of a regular convex polygon can be related to the number of edges between the chosen points.\n\n But note: the problem is about three distinct vertices. The angle at v2 is an inscribed angle? Actually, the three points form a triangle inside the circle (circumcircle of the polygon). The measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n\n However, note: the polygon is regular and convex, so the circumcircle is well-defined.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the center be O.\n   The central angle for one edge is (360/n) degrees.\n\n The arc from v1 to v3 (without going through v2) is (k * (360/n)) degrees for k being the number of edges (in terms of central angle steps) from v1 to v3.\n\n But wait: actually, the angle at v2 is determined by the two sides: from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. The angle at v2 is the angle of the triangle v1v2v3.\n\n There are two arcs from v2: one going to v1 and one going to v3. However, the angle at v2 is half the difference of the two arcs? Actually, no. In circle geometry, the angle at the circumference (inscribed angle) is half the central angle subtended by the same arc. But here, the angle at v2 is the angle of the triangle, and note that the arc opposite to v2 is the one from v1 to v3.\n\n However, there's a simpler way:\n\n Since the polygon is regular, the angle at a vertex for a triangle formed by three vertices can be expressed in terms of the steps (edges) between them.\n\n Actually, we can fix the vertex v2. Then, we can consider two sequences: going from v2 to v1 (say, clockwise) and from v2 to v3 (counterclockwise). But note: the problem says the polygon is convex and the vertices are labeled in clockwise order.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following approach:\n\n We know that the entire circle is 360 degrees. The angle at vertex v2 for three points (v1, v2, v3) is:\n\n   angle = (arc_length(v1, v3, excluding the direct path via v2)) / 2\n\n But wait, in a circle, the inscribed angle is half the central angle of the arc that the angle subtends. However, the arc that the angle at v2 subtends is the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2.\n\n Actually, the standard formula for an inscribed angle is: \n   angle = (arc_length) / 360 * 180   [because the full circle is 360 and the inscribed angle is half the central angle]\n\n But note: the angle at v2 is the angle of the triangle, and it is the angle between the chords v2v1 and v2v3. The inscribed angle theorem tells us that the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc from v1 to v3 (the one that does not include v2).\n\n However, in our case, the three points are on the circle. The arc from v1 to v3 that does not pass through v2 is the minor arc if the angle is less than 180, or the major arc? Actually, the inscribed angle is defined for the minor arc (if the central angle is less than 180). But note: the polygon is convex, and the points are in order.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let d1 be the number of edges from v2 to v1 (along one direction, say clockwise) and d2 be the number of edges from v2 to v3 (along the other direction, counterclockwise). Then, the total edges around the circle is n, so the arc from v1 to v3 that does not go through v2 has length (d1 + d2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the vertex (v2) between the other two vertices (v1 and v3) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently checking possible angles by considering the polygon's symmetry.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that in a regular convex n-gon, the angle formed at any vertex by three distinct vertices can be derived from the central angles between these vertices. The inscribed angle theorem helps here: the angle at a vertex is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n2. **Insight**: For a given vertex `v2`, the optimal angles are symmetric around the central angle. Specifically, the closest angles to `a` will be found by considering arcs centered around `v2`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Calculate Central Angle**: The central angle between adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees.\n   - **Determine Target Arcs**: Compute the arc lengths that would correspond to an angle close to `a` using the formula `arc_length = 2 * a` (since the inscribed angle is half the arc it subtends).\n   - **Check Valid Arcs**: For each vertex `v2`, check the nearest arcs (both clockwise and counter-clockwise) that could form an angle close to `a`. Adjust for the polygon's circular nature by considering modulo operations.\n4. **Optimization**: By focusing on symmetric arcs around each vertex, we reduce the number of checks needed, ensuring efficiency even for large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    if n == 3:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n        \n    total_degrees = 360.0\n    central_angle = total_degrees / n\n    \n    target_arc = 2 * a * central_angle\n    half_arc = central_angle\n    \n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_triangle = None\n\n    for start in range(n):\n        v2 = start + 1\n        for d in [1, -1]:\n            k = int(round(target_arc / half_arc))\n            if d == -1:\n                k = -k\n                \n            pos = start + k\n            if pos < 0:\n                pos += n\n            elif pos >= n:\n                pos -= n\n                \n            if pos == start:\n                continue\n                \n            d_steps = k % n\n            if d_steps < 0:\n                d_steps += n\n                \n            if d_steps == 0:\n                continue\n                \n            if d_steps == 1 or d_steps == n-1:\n                continue\n                \n            if abs(d_steps - n/2) < 1e-7 and n % 2 == 0:\n                continue\n                \n            v1_index = (start + d_steps) % n\n            v3_index = (start - d_steps) % n\n            \n            if v1_index == v3_index:\n                continue\n                \n            v1 = v1_index + 1\n            v3 = v3_index + 1\n            \n            arc_length = d_steps * central_angle\n            angle_val = arc_length / 2.0\n            diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n            \n            if diff < best_diff:\n                best_diff = diff\n                best_triangle = (v1, v2, v3)\n                \n            if diff < 1e-5:\n                break\n                \n    if best_triangle is None:\n        v2_candidate = 1\n        for d in [1, -1]:\n            k = 1\n            while True:\n                pos = (v2_candidate - 1 + k) % n\n                if pos == (v2_candidate - 1 + 1) % n or pos == (v2_candidate - 1 - 1) % n:\n                    k += 1\n                    continue\n                    \n                v1_index = pos\n                v3_index = (v2_candidate - 1 - k) % n\n                if v3_index < 0:\n                    v3_index += n\n                    \n                if v1_index == v3_index:\n                    k += 1\n                    continue\n                    \n                arc_length = k * central_angle\n                angle_val = arc_length / 2.0\n                diff = abs(angle_val - a)\n                \n                if diff < best_diff:\n                    best_diff = diff\n                    best_triangle = (v1_index+1, v2_candidate, v3_index+1)\n                    \n                if diff < 1e-5:\n                    break\n                    \n                k += 1\n                \n    print(f\"{best_triangle[0]} {best_triangle[1]} {best_triangle[2]}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If `n` is 3 (a triangle), the only possible angle is 60 degrees, so it directly outputs the vertices (1, 2, 3).\n3. **Central Angle Calculation**: Computes the central angle between adjacent vertices.\n4. **Target Arc Calculation**: Determines the arc length corresponding to the target angle `a`.\n5. **Finding Optimal Vertices**: For each vertex, checks nearby vertices to find the combination that minimizes the difference between the computed angle and `a`.\n6. **Output**: Prints the three vertices forming the closest angle to `a`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space by leveraging geometric properties and symmetry, ensuring optimal performance even for large polygons.",
