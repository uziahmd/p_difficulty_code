Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) with integer sides such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nBut note: the condition is also that the triangle inequality must hold: \n   x + y > z, and similarly for the other two? Actually, for a triangle with sides x, y, z, the necessary and sufficient condition is:\n   x + y > z, x + z > y, y + z > x.\n\nHowever, note that we have constraints on the ranges of x, y, z. Since x <= y <= z (because A<=B<=C and x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D] so x<=y<=z), then the most restrictive triangle inequality is the one that says x+y>z. The others are automatically satisfied because:\n   Since x<=y<=z, we have:\n      x+z >= x+y > z >= y   (but wait, actually x+z >= y+z >= y+y >= y+x? Not necessarily, but note: since x<=y<=z, then x+z>=y+z>=y+y>y (if x>0) but we must be cautious.\n\nActually, the standard way to check for a triangle when sides are sorted (x<=y<=z) is only to check x+y>z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of triples (x,y,z) with:\n   A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D, and x+y>z.\n\nBut note: the ranges can be up to 500000, so we cannot iterate over all triples.\n\nWe need to use combinatorial reasoning and possibly two pointers or binary search.\n\nLet me break down:\n\nWe can fix x and y, then count the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y. But note: z must be at least C and at most D, and also at least max(C, x+y) is not the condition, actually z must be less than x+y. So for fixed x,y, the condition for z is: C <= z <= min(D, x+y-1).\n\nBut wait: the condition is x+y>z, so z < x+y. Since z is integer, then z from C to min(D, x+y-1). Then the number of z is: max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) if min(D, x+y-1) >= C, else 0.\n\nThen we would do:\n\ntotal = 0\nfor x in [A, B]:\n  for y in [B, C]:   # but note: y starts from B to C, but we also have the constraint that y>=x? Actually, no: the condition is A<=x<=B and B<=y<=C, so x can be as large as B and y as small as B, so x might be greater than y? Actually, note that B<=C, so if x=B and y=B, then x=y. But note: the condition does not require x<=y, but the input condition is A<=B<=C<=D and then we have x in [A,B] and y in [B,C]. Since A<=B<=C, we have x<=B<=y, so x<=y. Similarly, y<=z.\n\nWait, actually: the condition is A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, so we have x<=B and y>=B, so indeed x<=y.\n\nSimilarly, y<=C and z>=C, so y<=z.\n\nTherefore, we have x<=y<=z.\n\nSo we can write:\n\ntotal = 0\nfor x from A to B:\n  for y from max(B, x) to C:   # but note: we already have y>=B and x<=B, so y>=B and we also have x<=y (since x<=B<=y). So we can just let y from B to C, but note: we must have y>=x? Actually, no: because the condition is independent. However, since x<=B<=y, then y>=B>=x? Actually, no: because x can be from A to B, and y from B to C. Since x<=B and y>=B, we have x<=y is always true? Because the maximum x is B and minimum y is B, so yes, x<=y.\n\nBut wait: what if x is 5 and y is 3? That cannot happen because our ranges: A<=B<=C, so B is at least A. And x is from A to B, y from B to C. So x<=B and y>=B, so x<=B<=y -> x<=y.\n\nSimilarly, y<=C and z>=C, so y<=z.\n\nSo we have x<=y<=z.\n\nNow, the triangle condition is x+y>z, which is the strictest.\n\nBut note: the total number of triples without the triangle condition is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1). We cannot iterate over all x,y because (B-A+1) and (C-B+1) can be up to 500000, so the product could be 25e12 which is too many.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nInstead, we can fix x and y and then count z, but we need to avoid O(n^2). \n\nBut note: the ranges are independent, but the condition is x+y>z and z in [C, D]. \n\nWe can try to fix x and y and then use the fact that for each (x,y) we want to count the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix z and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, but then we have to consider the ranges for x and y.\n\nBut note: the constraints on x and y: x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and also x<=y<=z (wait, no: the condition is just the ranges, but the triangle condition is x+y>z. Also, note that we don't require x<=y<=z for the triangle condition? Actually, the triangle condition is independent of ordering, but we have the side constraints.\n\nWait, actually the side constraints are independent: x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D]. But the triangle condition requires x+y>z, and we know that the sides are positive and we have x<=y<=z (from the ranges: x<=B<=y, and y<=C<=z). So the triangle condition is x+y>z.\n\nBut note: the side constraints do not require that x<=y<=z? Actually, the input condition says: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So yes, we have x<=y<=z.\n\nSo we can use the following:\n\nTotal = sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} [number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y]\n\nBut we can swap the order: we can fix z first, and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, but then we must restrict x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and also we must have y<=z? Actually, no: the condition is only on the entire triple: x<=B<=y<=C<=z, so y<=z is given by the ranges (since y<=C<=z). Therefore, for a fixed z, we require x+y>z, and x in [A,B], y in [B, min(C, z)]? Wait, no: the condition for y is [B, C] and z>=C, so y can be up to C (and C<=z) so y<=z is automatically satisfied. But note: the condition on z is [C, D] and we are iterating z from C to D.\n\nBut wait, the original condition for y is [B, C] and z is at least C, so y<=C<=z, so for fixed z, we have y from B to C (entire range) and x from A to B, but with the condition x+y>z.\n\nBut now we can also think: for fixed z, the condition is x+y>z, and we have x in [A,B], y in [B, C]. But note: we must also have y<=C<=z, so y<=z is given.\n\nHow to count pairs (x,y) for fixed z?\n\nWe require:\n  A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y>z.\n\nWe can fix x and then y must be in [max(B, z-x+1), C] (since x+y>z => y>z-x). But note: y must be at least B and at most C.\n\nSo for fixed x and z, the condition on y is: y >= max(B, z-x+1) and y<=C.\n\nBut we cannot iterate over x and z because the ranges are large.\n\nAlternative: iterate over z from C to D, and for each z, count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, with x in [A, B] and y in [B, C].\n\nWe can precompute the pairs (x,y) without the condition, but the condition is linear.\n\nWe can change the order: fix x, then y must be > z-x. And y is in [B, C]. So for fixed x and z, the smallest y is max(B, floor(z-x)+1) and the largest y is C.\n\nBut then we have to iterate over x from A to B and for each x iterate over z from C to D? That would be O((B-A+1)*(D-C+1)) which is too slow.\n\nAnother idea: we can precompute an array for y from B to C, and then for each x, we can use two pointers to move z? Or we can use cumulative sums.\n\nBut note: the condition is x+y>z, so z < x+y.\n\nWe can also fix the total s = x+y, then z must be < s and in [C, D]. But then we are back.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the total number of triples (without the triangle condition) and subtract the ones that do not satisfy the triangle condition.\n\nTotal triples = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\nBut then we need to subtract the degenerate and non-triangle cases? Actually, the condition for a non-degenerate triangle is x+y>z (with x<=y<=z). So the condition fails (i.e., degenerate or invalid) when x+y<=z.\n\nBut note: the triple (x,y,z) must satisfy x+y>z, and we have x<=y<=z. In this ordering, the only way it can fail is if x+y<=z.\n\nSo we can compute:\n\nAnswer = (total triples) - (# of triples with x+y<=z)\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Actually, the condition for a triangle is x+y>z, so the non-triangle condition is x+y<=z. So yes.\n\nBut note: we have the constraints on the ranges, so we can compute:\n\nTotal_triples = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\nThen subtract the number of triples (x,y,z) such that x+y<=z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D].\n\nNow, how to count the triples with x+y<=z?\n\nWe can fix z, then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C].\n\nBut note: z is from C to D, and for each z, we need to count the pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\nBut note: x+y can be as low as A+B (minimum) and as high as B+C (maximum). And z is at least C (which is >=B) and at most D.\n\nBut we have to consider: for a fixed z, the condition is x+y<=z.\n\nWe can iterate z from C to D, and for each z, we need to count the pairs (x,y) in [A,B]x[B,C] such that x+y<=z.\n\nBut the total range of z is (D-C+1) and for each z we iterate over x and y? That would be too slow.\n\nWe need a better way.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix x and y and then count the z that are >= x+y and in [C, D]. Then the condition for the bad triples is z>=x+y, and z in [C, D]. So the bad triples for a fixed (x,y) are the z from max(C, x+y) to D.\n\nThen the total bad triples = sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} max(0, D - max(C, x+y) + 1)\n\nBut wait, if x+y < C, then z from C to D are all bad? Actually, no: the bad condition is x+y<=z. If x+y < C, then z from C to D are all >=C > x+y (if x+y < C) so they are all bad? Actually, no: the bad condition is x+y<=z, and if x+y < C, then for any z>=C, we have x+y < C <= z, so indeed x+y<=z. So the bad triples for (x,y) with x+y < C are the entire segment of z from C to D.\n\nBut if x+y >= C, then the bad z are from x+y to D.\n\nSo we can write:\n\nbad = 0\nfor x from A to B:\n  for y from B to C:\n      s = x+y\n      if s < C:\n          bad += (D - C + 1)\n      else:\n          bad += max(0, D - s + 1)\n\nBut then we are iterating over (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be about 500000*500000 = 25e12, which is too slow.\n\nWe need to optimize.\n\nIdea: instead, we can fix x and then for each x, consider y from B to C.\n\nThen we can split the y's:\n\nFor fixed x, let s_min = A+B (but we are fixing x, so s_min for this x is x+B, s_max is x+C.\n\nThen we need to split the y's into two parts:\n\n1. y from B to y0-1: such that x+y < C (so bad triples for these y's: (D-C+1) for each)\n2. y from y0 to C: such that x+y >= C, and then the bad triples for these y's are max(0, D - (x+y) + 1)\n\nBut note: the condition for the first part: x+y < C  => y < C - x.\n\nSo for fixed x, the threshold y0 = max(B, floor(C-x)) [but actually we are dealing with integers, so y < C-x => y <= C-x-1].\n\nBut note: if C-x-1 < B, then there is no y in the first part.\n\nSo:\n\nLet y_low = B\nLet y_high = C\n\nThen, the first part: y from B to min(C, C-x-1) [if any] and then the second part: y from max(B, C-x) to C.\n\nBut note: we must also consider that y must be at least B.\n\nAlternatively, we can set:\n\nthreshold = max(B, C - x)   # then for y < threshold, the condition is x+y < C (if threshold is defined by C-x, then for y < C-x, x+y < C). But if C-x is less than B, then all y (from B to C) will have x+y >= C? \n\nActually, if C-x <= B, then the first part is empty because y must be at least B, and if B >= C-x, then for y>=B, we have y>=C-x, so x+y>=x+(C-x)=C.\n\nSo:\n\nLet y0 = max(B, C - x)   # then for y < y0, we don't have any (if any) because y0 is at least B, so the first part is from B to y0-1, but only if y0-1 >= B.\n\nBut if y0 <= B, then the first part is empty.\n\nActually, we can define:\n\nlow_bound = max(B, C - x + 1)   # wait, no: the condition for the first part is x+y < C, i.e., y < C-x. Since y is integer, y <= C-x-1.\n\nSo:\n\nLet y_low1 = B\nLet y_high1 = min(C, C-x-1)   # if C-x-1 < B, then no y in the first part.\n\nThen the number of y in the first part is: max(0, min(C, C-x-1) - B + 1)\n\nBut note: if C-x-1 < B, then we take 0.\n\nThen for the second part: y from max(B, C-x) to C, but then the bad count for each y is max(0, D - (x+y) + 1)\n\nBut wait, in the second part, we are counting the bad triples (z from x+y to D, inclusive). So the count for a particular (x,y) is (D - (x+y) + 1) if x+y <= D, else 0.\n\nBut note: the bad condition is x+y<=z, and z is from C to D. For the second part, we have x+y>=C (by definition of the second part) and then the bad z are from x+y to D.\n\nSo the bad count for (x,y) in the second part is max(0, D - (x+y) + 1).\n\nNow, we can write:\n\nFor fixed x:\n  part1_count = max(0, min(C, C-x-1) - B + 1)   # if min(C, C-x-1) >= B, then count = min(C, C-x-1) - B + 1, else 0.\n  Then the contribution from part1 is: part1_count * (D - C + 1)\n\n  Then for part2: we need to iterate y from y_low2 = max(B, C-x) to C, and for each y, add max(0, D - (x+y) + 1)\n\nBut note: the second part has (C - max(B, C-x) + 1) terms, and each term is decreasing in y. \n\nBut we cannot iterate over each y in the second part for each x because the total work might be O(n^2).\n\nAlternative: we can precompute a function f(y) = D - (x+y) + 1 for y in [max(B, C-x), C] and then use prefix sums? But we are iterating over x, and x changes.\n\nWait, we can restructure: Instead of iterating over x and then over y, we can iterate over y first and then over x? Or use cumulative sums.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints are up to 500000, so we need an O(n log n) solution.\n\nAnother idea: we can use two pointers or binary search for the second part.\n\nBut note: the second part for fixed x is the sum_{y = L}^{R} max(0, D - x - y + 1), where L = max(B, C-x) and R = C.\n\nThis is equivalent to: for y from L to R, we have y <= D-x (because if y > D-x, then D-x-y+1 becomes negative and we take 0). But note: D-x might be less than R? \n\nActually, we can break the second part into two subparts:\n\n  Condition for the second part: y >= C-x (so that x+y>=C) and y<=C.\n\n  But also, the expression D-x-y+1 is positive only if y <= D-x.\n\n  So the second part is further split:\n\n    Let y_low2 = max(B, C-x)\n    Let y_high2 = min(C, D-x)\n\n    Then for y from y_low2 to y_high2: the bad count is D-x-y+1.\n    For y from y_high2+1 to C: the bad count is 0.\n\nThen the second part contribution is: \n    Sum_{y=y_low2}^{y_high2} (D-x-y+1)\n\nBut note: we can compute this sum quickly if we can express it as an arithmetic series.\n\nThe sum is: \n    Let n = y_high2 - y_low2 + 1\n    Then the terms are: (D-x - y_low2 + 1), (D-x - (y_low2+1) + 1), ... until (D-x - y_high2 + 1)\n\n    This is the same as: \n        = (D-x+1 - y_low2) + (D-x+1 - (y_low2+1)) + ... + (D-x+1 - y_high2)\n\n    Let T = D-x+1\n    Then the sum is: n*T - (sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (y_low2+i))\n\n    = n*T - (n*y_low2 + n*(n-1)//2)\n\nBut note: we have to check if y_low2 <= y_high2.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nFor each x from A to B:\n\n  Part1:\n    Let y_max1 = min(C, C-x-1)\n    If y_max1 >= B:\n        count1 = y_max1 - B + 1\n        bad1 = count1 * (D - C + 1)\n    Else:\n        count1 = 0\n        bad1 = 0\n\n  Part2:\n    Let L = max(B, C-x)\n    Let R = min(C, D-x)   # because if y>D-x, then the term is 0.\n\n    If L <= R:\n        n = R - L + 1\n        T = D - x + 1   # which is the base value for the first term (when y=L: term = T - L)\n        # Actually, the term for y is (T - y)\n        # Sum_{y=L}^{R} (T - y) = n*T - (L+R)*n//2   [Wait, the sum of y from L to R is n*(L+R)//2]\n        # Alternatively: \n        #   Sum_{y=L}^{R} (T-y) = n*T - (sum_{y=L}^{R} y)\n        #   Sum_{y=L}^{R} y = (L+R)*n//2\n\n        bad2 = n*T - (L+R)*n//2\n    Else:\n        bad2 = 0\n\n    bad_x = bad1 + bad2\n\nThen total_bad += bad_x\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me test with a small example.\n\nExample: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nTotal triples: (2)*(2)*(2)=8? Actually, x in [1,2], y in [2,3], z in [3,4] -> 2*2*2=8.\n\nNow, the valid triangles: \n  (1,3,3): 1+3>3 -> 4>3 -> valid.\n  (1,3,4): 1+3>4? 4>4 -> no, invalid.\n  (2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> 4>3 -> valid.\n  (2,2,4): 2+2>4? 4>4 -> no.\n  (2,3,3): 2+3>3 -> 5>3 -> valid.\n  (2,3,4): 2+3>4 -> 5>4 -> valid.\n\nSo valid = 4, invalid = 4.\n\nBut wait, the example output says 4. So the answer is 4, meaning the bad ones are 4.\n\nNow, let's compute bad using our method:\n\nFor x=1:\n  Part1: y_max1 = min(3, 3-1-1)=min(3,1)=1 -> but 1 < B=2 -> so part1: 0.\n  Part2: L = max(2, 3-1)=max(2,2)=2, R = min(3, 4-1)=min(3,3)=3.\n        n=2, T=4-1+1=4, then bad2 = 2*4 - (2+3)*2//2 = 8 - 5*2//2? Actually, (L+R)*n//2 = (2+3)*2//2 = 5.\n        So bad2 = 8 - 5 = 3.\n\nFor x=2:\n  Part1: y_max1 = min(3, 3-2-1)=min(3,0)=0 -> 0.\n  Part2: L = max(2,3-2)=max(2,1)=2, R=min(3,4-2)=min(3,2)=2.\n        n=1, T=4-2+1=3, bad2 = 1*3 - (2+2)*1//2 = 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nTotal bad = 3+1 = 4. Correct.\n\nBut wait, the example input says \"1 2 3 4\" -> output 4. Our method counts the bad ones as 4, so the answer would be total_triples - bad = 8-4=4.\n\nBut note: we are counting the bad triples (non-triangle) and then subtracting from the total.\n\nSo the answer = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1) - total_bad\n\nBut wait, in the example, we have 8-4=4.\n\nBut let me check the example provided: \n  Input: \"1 2 3 4\" -> Output: \"4\"\n\nYes, so that matches.\n\nBut wait, the example input also includes:\n  \"1 2 2 5\" -> output \"3\"\n  \"500000 500000 500000 500000\" -> output \"1\"\n\nLet me test with \"1 2 2 5\":\n\nx in [1,2], y in [2,2] (since B=2, C=2), z in [2,5] (C=2, D=5)\n\nTotal triples: (2-1+1)=2, (2-2+1)=1, (5-2+1)=4 -> 2*1*4=8.\n\nNow, the valid triangles: \n  (1,2,2): 1+2>2 -> 3>2 -> valid.\n  (1,2,3): 1+2>3 -> 3>3 -> no.\n  (1,2,4): 1+2>4 -> 3>4 -> no.\n  (1,2,5): 1+2>5 -> 3>5 -> no.\n  (2,2,2): 2+2>2 -> valid.\n  (2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> 4>3 -> valid.\n  (2,2,4): 2+2>4 -> 4>4 -> no.\n  (2,2,5): 2+2>5 -> 4>5 -> no.\n\nValid: (1,2,2), (2,2,2), (2,2,3) -> 3.\n\nSo answer=3.\n\nNow, compute bad:\n\nTotal_triples=8.\n\nWe compute bad:\n\nFor x=1:\n  Part1: y_max1 = min(2, 2-1-1)=min(2,0)=0 -> 0.\n  Part2: L = max(2, 2-1)=max(2,1)=2, R=min(2,5-1)=min(2,4)=2.\n        n=1, T=5-1+1=5, bad2 = 1*5 - (2+2)*1//2 = 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nFor x=2:\n  Part1: y_max1 = min(2, 2-2-1)=min(2,-1)= -1 -> 0.\n  Part2: L = max(2,2-2)=max(2,0)=2, R=min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2.\n        n=1, T=5-2+1=4, bad2 = 1*4 - (2+2)*1//2 = 4-2=2.\n\nTotal bad = 3+2=5.\n\nThen answer = 8-5=3. Correct.\n\nNow, the third example: \"500000 500000 500000 500000\"\n\nx in [500000,500000], y in [500000,500000], z in [500000,500000]\n\nTotal_triples=1.\n\nTriangle condition: 500000+500000>500000 -> 1000000>500000 -> valid.\n\nBad=0.\n\nBut let's compute:\n\nPart1: y_max1 = min(500000, 500000-500000-1)=min(500000, -1) -> 0.\nPart2: L = max(500000, 500000-500000)=max(500000,0)=500000, R=min(500000,500000-500000)=min(500000,0)=0 -> then L>R, so bad2=0.\n\nTotal bad=0.\n\nAnswer=1-0=1.\n\nCorrect.\n\nBut wait, the above code for part2 uses:\n\n    bad2 = n*T - (L+R)*n//2\n\nBut note: T = D-x+1, and the term for y is (T-y) = (D-x+1 - y)\n\nBut is that correct? In the example for x=1, D=5, then T=5-1+1=5, and for y=2, the term is 5-2=3, which is the count of z from x+y=3 to D=5: [3,4,5] -> 3 numbers, correct.\n\nBut wait, the condition for bad is x+y<=z, and for (x,y)=(1,2): x+y=3, then z from 3 to 5 (inclusive) -> 3,4,5 -> 3 numbers. Correct.\n\nBut note: the formula for the sum from y=L to R of (T-y) is indeed an arithmetic series.\n\nBut wait: the sum_{y=L}^{R} (T-y) = (T-L) + (T-(L+1)) + ... + (T-R)\n\nWhich is: n*T - (L + (L+1) + ... + R) = n*T - (n*R - n*(n-1)//2 + ???) \n\nActually, the sum of consecutive integers from L to R is: (L+R)*n//2, so that part is correct.\n\nBut note: the above formula is correct.\n\nBut the problem: the ranges for x and y can be very large (up to 500000) and we are iterating x from A to B (which can be 500000) and for each x we do a constant time computation.\n\nSo the overall complexity is O(B-A+1) which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, note that B-A+1 can be up to 500000, so we are doing 500000 iterations, each with a few conditions and arithmetic operations.\n\nBut wait, in the example \"1 2 3 4\", we did two iterations (x=1 and x=2) and got the result.\n\nSo we can write:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read A, B, C, D.\n\n2. total_triples = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\n3. total_bad = 0\n   for x from A to B:\n        # Part1: y from B to min(C, C-x-1)\n        y_max1 = min(C, C - x - 1)\n        if y_max1 >= B:\n            count1 = y_max1 - B + 1\n            bad1 = count1 * (D - C + 1)\n        else:\n            bad1 = 0\n\n        # Part2: y from max(B, C-x) to min(C, D-x)\n        L2 = max(B, C - x)\n        R2 = min(C, D - x)\n        if L2 <= R2:\n            n = R2 - L2 + 1\n            T_val = D - x + 1   # T\n            # Sum_{y=L2}^{R2} (T_val - y) = n*T_val - (sum of y from L2 to R2)\n            sum_y = (L2 + R2) * n // 2\n            bad2 = n * T_val - sum_y\n        else:\n            bad2 = 0\n\n        total_bad += bad1 + bad2\n\n4. Answer = total_triples - total_bad\n\nBut wait, let me test with a small case that didn't work earlier: the example \"1 2 2 5\" we computed by hand and got bad=5, so the code should return 5.\n\nBut wait, in the code above for x=1, we had:\n   bad1 = 0\n   L2 = max(2, 2-1)=max(2,1)=2\n   R2 = min(2,5-1)=min(2,4)=2\n   n=1\n   T_val=5-1+1=5\n   sum_y = (2+2)*1//2 = 2\n   bad2 = 1*5 - 2 = 3\n\nFor x=2:\n   bad1=0\n   L2 = max(2,2-2)=max(2,0)=2\n   R2 = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2\n   n=1\n   T_val=5-2+1=4\n   sum_y = (2+2)*1//2=2\n   bad2=1*4-2=2\n\nTotal_bad=3+2=5.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, there is a catch: the condition for part1 is that we consider y from B to min(C, C-x-1). In the example \"1 2 2 5\", C=2, so for x=1: C-x-1=0, so y_max1=0, which is < B=2, so part1=0. Correct.\n\nBut what if C-x-1 is negative? Then y_max1 = min(C, negative) -> negative, and then we set bad1=0. Correct.\n\nBut note: the part1 condition is for y from B to min(C, C-x-1). But if C-x-1 is negative, then min(C, negative) is negative, and then we check if negative>=B? No, so bad1=0.\n\nNow, one more edge: when C-x-1 is between B and C.\n\nExample: A=1, B=3, C=5, D=10, x=2.\n\nThen part1: y_max1 = min(5,5-2-1)=min(5,2)=2.\nBut B=3, so 2<3 -> bad1=0.\n\nBut wait, for x=2, we need to check: the condition for part1 is y < C-x, i.e., y<5-2=3, so y<=2. But y must be at least B=3, so indeed no y in part1.\n\nBut what if B=2, then for x=2, part1: y_max1=min(5,5-2-1)=2, and B=2, so y from 2 to 2 (if 2<=2) -> count1=1, bad1= (D-C+1)= (10-5+1)=6.\n\nBut wait, the condition for part1: y<=2, and y must be at least B=2, so y=2 is included. Then the condition x+y<=z for y=2: 2+2=4, so z from C=5 to D=10 are all bad (since 4<5, so indeed for y=2, all z from 5 to 10 are bad). So bad1=6, correct.\n\nBut note: in our code, we set y_max1 = min(C, C-x-1) and then if y",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The triangle must satisfy the condition \\(x + y > z\\) (the other two conditions \\(x + z > y\\) and \\(y + z > x\\) are automatically satisfied if \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\) and \\(x + y > z\\)).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) within the given ranges that form a non-degenerate triangle. The key insight is recognizing that for \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the triangle inequality simplifies to \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of directly counting valid triples, we compute the total number of possible triples and subtract those that do not satisfy the triangle condition (\\(x + y \\leq z\\)). This approach leverages the observation that invalid triples can be efficiently counted by considering each \\(x\\) and then determining the range of \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) values that make the triple invalid.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Total Triples Calculation**: The total number of triples without any constraints is \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1) \\times (D - C + 1)\\).\n   - **Invalid Triples Calculation**: For each \\(x\\) from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), count the number of \\((y, z)\\) pairs where \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), but \\(x + y \\leq z\\).
