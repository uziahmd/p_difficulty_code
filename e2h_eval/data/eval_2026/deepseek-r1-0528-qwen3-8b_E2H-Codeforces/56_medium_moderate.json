Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (number of rebels and bases) and then 2R+B points (R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases). We need to check if there exists a perfect matching (one-to-one assignment) between the R rebels and the B bases such that the straight line segments (from each base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" (from a base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect. This means that if we assign each spaceship to a base with a straight line segment, then no two segments should cross.\n\n But note: the problem also says that the assignment is a perfect matching (so we must assign every base to exactly one spaceship and vice versa). Therefore, we have a bipartite graph between R rebels and B bases, but we are not given edges. Instead, we are only concerned with the geometric condition.\n\n However, wait: the input does not specify which bases are connected to which rebels by an edge? Actually, the problem does not say that we must consider all possible edges. It says: \"if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So we are allowed to choose any matching (any assignment) as long as the straight line segments connecting the matched pairs do not intersect.\n\n But note: the example input has 3 rebels and 3 bases, and the output is 'Yes'. The second example: 2 rebels and 1 base -> 'No' because we cannot have a perfect matching (unless R=B, but here R=2, B=1, so no perfect matching).\n\n However, wait: the problem states that the assignment must be a perfect matching. So if R != B, then there is no perfect matching? But note the problem statement says: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", meaning that the number of bases must equal the number of spaceships? \n\n Let me read the constraints: 1 <= R, B <= 10.\n\n So we must have R == B for a perfect matching? Because we need to assign each of the R spaceships to one of the B bases and each base to one spaceship. So the matching is perfect only when R = B.\n\n Therefore, we can assume that the input must satisfy R == B? Otherwise, we can immediately output 'No'.\n\n But wait, the example input: \n   Input: ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n In the first example, R=3, B=3 -> perfect matching exists and condition holds -> output 'Yes'.\n In the second example, R=2, B=1 -> no perfect matching (since 2 != 1) -> output 'No'.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi\" for rebels, and then the next B lines for bases. So the total number of points is R (rebels) + B (bases). And we require R == B for a perfect matching? Actually, the problem says: \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian\", so the numbers must be equal.\n\n Therefore, we can start by checking if R != B, then output 'No'. But wait, what if R != B? Then there's no way to have a one-to-one matching. So indeed, the problem requires R == B.\n\n However, note: the problem does not explicitly state that R must equal B, but the definition of perfect matching in a bipartite graph with two parts of size R and B requires R==B. So we can assume R==B is necessary.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read R and B.\n 2. If R != B: print 'No' and exit.\n\n 3. Read the next R lines for rebels and then B lines for bases.\n\n 4. Now, we have to check if there exists a perfect matching (a bijection) from rebels to bases such that the straight line segments connecting each rebel to its base do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" (i.e., segments) do not intersect.\n\n How to check?\n\n Observation: Since we have a set of points (rebels and bases) and we wish to assign each rebel to a base with non-intersecting segments, we can think of the problem as drawing non-crossing edges from rebels to bases.\n\n There are two known approaches:\n\n Approach 1: Use the fact that for non-intersecting segments, we can use the following:\n\n   - We can fix an order for the rebels and the bases (for example, sort by x-coordinate or y-coordinate). Then, we must have a matching that is non-crossing.\n\n   - However, note that the problem does not require the entire set of points to be in convex position or anything. But the condition is about the straight line segments.\n\n   - We can use the following idea: the set of points (both rebels and bases) can be drawn without crossing if we can order the rebels and the bases in two sequences (say, by x-coordinate) and then connect the i-th rebel to the i-th base without crossing.\n\n   But wait: actually, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose the matching arbitrarily. However, the condition of non-intersection is independent of the assignment order.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following theorem: \n\n   Given two sets of points (say, A and B) and we wish to know if there exists a non-crossing matching (with |A|=|B|), we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Sort all points (both rebels and bases) by x, and for same x, by y.\n\n   Step 2: Then, we try to form a matching that goes from the leftmost point to the next, etc. But note: the two sets are distinct (rebels and bases). So we have two interleaved sets.\n\n   Actually, we can use a recursive method: \n\n   - Consider the leftmost point (smallest x, and then smallest y). Then, the matching for this point must go to one of the bases (or one of the rebels, but wait: we are matching rebels to bases). However, note: the problem doesn't specify which set is which. We have two sets: rebels and bases.\n\n   But note: the problem says the rebels are given first and then the bases.\n\n   However, we are free to assign any base to any rebel.\n\n   Standard solution for non-crossing bipartite matching:\n\n   We can use a plane sweep and use a recursive function that matches the leftmost point (either rebel or base) and then splits the plane into two half-planes and recursively solves for the left part and the right part.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the matching is from rebels to bases, so we have two distinct sets. But the condition of non-intersection applies to the entire set of segments.\n\n   Another idea: \n\n   We can use a greedy approach after sorting by x-coordinate (and breaking ties by y). Then, we can try to form a matching by connecting the rebels and bases in increasing x-order. But how?\n\n   Actually, we can use the following:\n\n   Sort all points (all rebels and bases) by x (and then by y). Then, we know that the matching must be such that if we traverse from left to right, then the segments we draw must not cross.\n\n   But note: the two sets are fixed. We cannot mix rebels and bases arbitrarily in the sorted order.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   Let L = list of rebels, M = list of bases.\n\n   Then, we can combine them and sort by x (and then by y). Then, we can use a two-pointer technique to try to match the rebels and bases in the sorted order.\n\n   However, the problem is that the matching must be between the rebels and bases, so we cannot match two rebels or two bases.\n\n   Alternate approach: \n\n   Since R and B are at most 10, we can use brute-force (exhaustive search) over all permutations (matchings) and check for non-intersection.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Check if R == B, else return 'No'.\n\n   Step 2: Read all points.\n\n   Step 3: Generate all bijections from the R rebels to the B bases (which is R! possibilities, and since R<=10, that's up to 10! = 3628800, which is acceptable in worst-case but we have 10 points, so we can do it).\n\n   However, we have two sets: rebels and bases, and we want to assign each rebel to a base. We can represent the rebels as a list and bases as another list.\n\n   Then, for each permutation of the bases (assigning the i-th base in the permutation to the i-th rebel), we check if the segments connecting the rebels to their assigned bases do not intersect.\n\n   But note: the condition is that no two segments (from different pairs) should intersect.\n\n   How to check for intersection of two line segments?\n\n   We have two segments: AB and CD, where A and B are endpoints (but note: the two segments are from a rebel to a base and from another rebel to a base). \n\n   We can use the standard algorithm for checking if two line segments intersect. \n\n   However, note: the segments are between two points, and the endpoints are distinct and no three points are collinear (given).\n\n   We can use the orientation method.\n\n   Steps for checking intersection of two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2):\n\n     We can check if the orientations are different (one clockwise and the other counterclockwise) or if the points are collinear (but the problem says no three are collinear, so we don't have to worry about collinear cases). \n\n   Actually, the standard method for checking if two segments intersect (without collinear) is:\n\n     Let A = (x1,y1), B = (x2,y2) for the first segment, and C = (x3,y3), D = (x4,y4) for the second.\n\n     We can define a function for orientation of triplet (A,B,C): \n\n        o1 = (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - B.x) - (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - B.y)\n\n     But wait, there are multiple ways. Alternatively, we can use the cross product.\n\n     However, note: we are checking for any two segments (in the entire matching) to not intersect. \n\n   But wait: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\", meaning that we must check that no two segments cross. \n\n   However, note: the matching is a set of segments that may or may not cross. \n\n   Important: the matching is a set of R segments (since R=B). We must check that none of these segments intersect.\n\n   But note: two segments in the matching are defined by two disjoint pairs. So we have to check for every pair of segments (each segment being between a rebel and a base) whether they cross.\n\n   However, note: the matching is a set of non-overlapping edges (in terms of endpoints) but the segments might still cross in the interior.\n\n   Algorithm for checking non-intersection for a given matching (permutation):\n\n     For each pair of segments (each segment is (rebel_i, base_j)) and (rebel_k, base_l) with i != k and j != l, check if they intersect.\n\n     But note: two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect if and only if the orientations are different (or one of the endpoints lies on the other segment) but the problem says no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry about endpoint lying on the segment.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"no three points are on the same line\", so no three points (including the endpoints) are collinear. Therefore, the endpoints will not lie on the other segment (unless they are the same point, but the problem says no two points coincide). So we can ignore the degenerate cases.\n\n   So we can use the following:\n\n     Two segments (A, B) and (C, D) intersect if and only if:\n\n        (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) have different orientations (one clockwise and the other counterclockwise) and similarly (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) have different orientations.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        orient(A, B, C) * orient(A, B, D) < 0\n\n        and\n\n        orient(C, D, A) * orient(C, D, B) < 0\n\n   However, there is a simpler way: \n\n        Check if the two segments intersect by the following:\n\n        def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n            # a, b, c, d are tuples (x,y)\n            def cross(o, a, b):\n                return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n            def between(a, b, c):\n                # Check if c is between a and b in the line from a to b? But we don't need that if we use the orientation method with the entire condition.\n                pass\n\n            # Check if the two segments straddle each other\n            o1 = cross(a, b, c)\n            o2 = cross(a, b, d)\n            o3 = cross(c, d, a)\n            o4 = cross(c, d, b)\n\n            if ((o1 > 0 and o2 < 0) or (o1 < 0 and o2 > 0)) and \\\n               ((o3 > 0 and o4 < 0) or (o3 < 0 and o4 > 0)):\n                return True\n            return False\n\n   However, note: the above condition is sufficient for non-collinear segments (with no three points collinear). But note: if the two segments are collinear, then we would have o1=0, etc., but the problem states no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   But wait: the condition above only checks that the two segments are in general position and crosses. However, there is an alternative: \n\n        The segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect if and only if:\n            cross(a, b, c) * cross(a, b, d) < 0 and cross(c, d, a) * cross(c, d, b) < 0\n\n   This is the standard method.\n\n   However, note: sometimes the segments might share an endpoint? But our matching uses distinct points (each base is assigned to one rebel and vice versa). So the four points are distinct.\n\n   So we can define:\n\n        def segments_intersect(p1, p2, p3, p4):\n            def cross(o, a, b):\n                return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\n            o1 = cross(p1, p2, p3)\n            o2 = cross(p1, p2, p4)\n            o3 = cross(p3, p4, p1)\n            o4 = cross(p3, p4, p2)\n\n            if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n                return True\n            return False\n\n   But note: the above condition is symmetric? Actually, we only need to check the condition for both segments. However, the condition is: the two segments intersect if they are interlocked. The above condition is correct.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the above condition might not capture the case when the segments are collinear? But the problem says no three points are collinear, so the cross products are non-zero.\n\n   Then, for a given matching (a permutation of bases for the rebels), we check for every pair of segments (i, j) (where i < j) in the matching, if they intersect. If we find one intersection, then this matching is invalid.\n\n   Then, we iterate over all permutations (there are factorial(R) permutations) and if we find at least one permutation that gives no two segments intersecting, we output 'Yes'. Otherwise, if none exists, we output 'No'.\n\n   However, note: the matching is a bijection from the set of rebels to the set of bases, so we are permuting the bases and assigning to the rebels in a fixed order? \n\n   But note: the rebels are given in an order, but the matching can be arbitrary. We can fix the order of the rebels (by index) and then assign the bases arbitrarily. However, the condition of non-intersection is independent of the order we assign.\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify an order. However, we are generating all permutations of the bases (so we are trying every assignment). \n\n   However, we must be cautious: the rebels are fixed in their positions, and the bases are fixed in their positions.\n\n   Steps for the brute-force:\n\n        Let rebels = list of R points (each as (x, y))\n        Let bases = list of B points (each as (x, y))\n\n        Then, for each permutation p of bases (which is a list of B points, and we have R=B), we form a list of segments: [ (rebels[i], p[i]) for i in range(R) ]\n\n        Then, for this matching, check for any two distinct segments (i and j) whether they intersect.\n\n        How to check for two segments (a, b) and (c, d) in the matching? Note: the matching is a set of segments. We have R segments. We must check every unordered pair of distinct segments.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            for i in range(len(segments)):\n                for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n                    if segments_intersect(segments[i][0], segments[i][1], segments[j][0], segments[j][1]):\n                        break the inner loop and try next permutation\n                else:\n                    continue\n                break\n            else:\n                # no intersections found, we found a valid matching\n                return 'Yes'\n\n        If we try all permutations and none works, then output 'No'\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the rebels are given in a particular order. But the assignment is arbitrary. We are generating all permutations of the bases, so we are covering all assignments.\n\n   But wait: is the order of the rebels important? In the matching, we are matching the i-th rebel (from the original list) to the i-th base in the permutation. But the problem does not specify an order for the rebels. However, the rebels are distinct points. The assignment is from the set of rebels to the set of bases. \n\n   But note: the problem does not require the rebels to be assigned in any particular order. Our method of fixing the rebels in the order they appear and then permuting the bases is correct because we are trying every assignment.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the condition of non-intersection depends on the actual positions. The order of the rebels in the list does not matter for the geometric condition. But we are representing the matching as an ordered list of segments. However, the segments_intersect function does not care about the order of the two segments.\n\n   Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n   But note: performance. The number of permutations is R! (which for R=10 is 3628800). Then, for each permutation, we check C(R,2) = R*(R-1)/2 pairs (which is 45 for R=10). Each intersection check is constant time (using the cross product). So the total operations would be about 3628800 * 45 = around 163 million, which is acceptable in Python? \n\n   However, worst-case 10! is 3628800, and 3628800 * 45 is about 163 million, which is acceptable in Pyton in a competitive programming setting (if we code in C++ it's fast, but in Python we might need to optimize a bit). But 163 million iterations might take a few seconds in Python. \n\n   But note: the problem constraints say that R and B are at least 1 and at most 10, so worst-case R=10, B=10.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a smarter method to avoid checking all permutations.\n\n   There is a known method for non-crossing bipartite matching in a plane: \n\n        Sort the rebels and bases by x-coordinate (or y-coordinate). Then, we can use a greedy matching or dynamic programming. But note: the condition is non-intersecting.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify that the matching must be planar, but we are allowed to choose arbitrarily. \n\n   Another idea: \n\n        Since the points are in general position, we can use the following:\n\n        Step 1: Combine the rebels and bases and sort by x (and then by y). Then, we can use a recursive function that assigns the leftmost point (if it's a rebel) to one of the bases that are to the right (that are unmatched) and then remove those points and solve recursively.\n\n        But note: the two sets are distinct. We can use the standard \"matching in a bipartite graph with geometric constraints\".\n\n   However, given the small constraints (n<=10), the brute-force over permutations is acceptable.\n\n   But wait: the worst-case is 10! which is 3628800, and for each permutation we do about 45 checks (each check is 4 cross products, so 45*4=180 operations per permutation). Then 3628800 * 180 is about 653 million operations, which might be borderline in Python.\n\n   However, we can optimize by precomputing the cross products? Or by using a more efficient representation.\n\n   Alternatively, we can break early: if we find an intersection in the matching, we break and try the next permutation.\n\n   But worst-case we still have to check all pairs for each permutation until we find a valid one or not.\n\n   Another idea: we can use the fact that the matching must be non-crossing and use a recursive backtracking with pruning. But the problem is small enough.\n\n   However, let's write the brute-force and hope that the average case is better. Or we can use the following:\n\n        We can also note: if we fix an ordering of the rebels and bases by x-coordinate, then a necessary condition for a non-crossing matching is that the matching is non-crossing in the sorted order. But wait, actually, we can use the following:\n\n        Sort the rebels by x, and the bases by x. Then, we require that the matching is non-crossing if we connect the i-th rebel (by x) to the i-th base (by x) or something similar? Not necessarily.\n\n        Actually, the standard non-crossing bipartite matching in a plane (when the two sets are interleaved) is done by the following:\n\n          Sort both sets by x, then use a greedy matching: \n\n          We can use the following: \n\n            Sort the rebels by x, and the bases by x.\n\n            Then, for the leftmost rebel, we can only connect to the bases that are to the right of the rebel and that are not blocked by other rebels and bases. \n\n        But note: the problem does not require the matching to be contiguous, but non-crossing.\n\n        There is a known result: a non-crossing matching exists if and only if the two sets can be interleaved without crossing. \n\n        We can use the following algorithm (recursive):\n\n          Sort the rebels and bases by x.\n\n          Then, take the leftmost rebel (lowest x) and the leftmost base (lowest x). Then, we have two choices: \n\n            Either the segment from the leftmost rebel to the leftmost base is drawn, then we remove both and recurse.\n\n            Or, we might draw the leftmost rebel to a base that is not the leftmost? But then we have to ensure that the segment does not cross. \n\n        Actually, the standard way to check for a non-crossing matching is to use the following:\n\n          We can use the \"two pointers\" method and then check the relative order of the bases and rebels.\n\n        However, I recall that there is a known algorithm for non-crossing matching in a bipartite graph with two sets of points (the two sets are given in sorted order) and we can use a greedy matching by connecting the leftmost of the rebels to the leftmost base that is not too far, but actually the condition is that the matching is non-crossing.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the matching to be contiguous, but non-crossing. And the standard algorithm is:\n\n          Sort the rebels and bases by x (and then by y, if needed). Then, we can use a recursive function that, given two sets of points (rebels and bases) that are sorted by x, and then we consider the leftmost rebel and the leftmost base. Then, we have two possibilities:\n\n            Option 1: Connect the leftmost rebel to the leftmost base. Then, remove both and check the rest.\n\n            Option 2: Connect the leftmost rebel to the rightmost base. Then, remove both and check the rest.\n\n          Why the rightmost? Because if we connect the leftmost rebel to a base that is not the leftmost, then the segment might cross some other segment? Actually, we have to consider the entire configuration.\n\n        Actually, the correct method is:\n\n          Sort the rebels and bases by x. Then, the matching is non-crossing if and only if the following holds:\n\n            For the leftmost rebel, we can connect it to the leftmost base or the rightmost base (because if we connect to a base in the middle, then we might create a crossing with the segment from the base to the next rebel). \n\n          However, wait: if we connect the leftmost rebel to a base that is not the leftmost nor the rightmost, then the segment from the leftmost rebel to that base might cross the segment from the leftmost base to some other rebel? \n\n          Actually, the standard method for non-crossing matching is:\n\n            Sort the rebels and bases by x. Then, for the leftmost rebel, we can connect it to any base that is to the right of the rebel (because the matching must be from left to right). Then, we remove the chosen base and the rebel, and then recursively solve the rest.\n\n          But the key is: the matching must not cross. The condition is that the two sets are interleaved arbitrarily.\n\n        However, there is a known fact: \n\n          A non-crossing matching exists if and only if the two sets (rebels and bases) can be matched without crossing, and this is independent of the order? Actually, no.\n\n        After research, the standard algorithm for non-crossing bipartite matching is to use the following:\n\n          Sort the rebels and bases by x. Then, the matching is non-crossing if we can match the rebels to bases such that the matching is a planar embedding. One way is to use the \"greedy\" method: \n\n            We can use a stack or simply check the relative orders.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n          We can check if the permutation defined by the matching (when we sort the rebels by x and the bases by x) is such that the matching is non-crossing. \n\n        But note: the problem does not require the matching to be contiguous, but the non-crossing condition is equivalent to: \n\n          If we sort the rebels by x and the bases by x, then the matching must be a non-crossing matching (like a parenthesis matching). \n\n        However, the non-crossing condition for bipartite matching is that if we consider the two sets as two rows, then the matching is non-crossing if the segments do not cross.\n\n        There is a known efficient algorithm for non-crossing bipartite matching: \n\n          We can use dynamic programming or even a greedy algorithm by sorting.\n\n        But given the small n (<=10), we can stick to the brute-force.\n\n   Considering the constraints (n<=10), we'll use the brute-force over all permutations.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Read R, B.\n        If R != B: print 'No' and exit.\n\n        Read R lines for rebels.\n        Read B lines for bases.\n\n        Precompute a helper function: segments_intersect(a, b, c, d) that returns True if the segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect.\n\n        Generate all permutations of the bases (which are B elements, and R=B).\n\n        For each permutation p (which is a list of bases, of length R):\n\n            Form a list of segments: for i in range(R): segment from rebels[i] to p[i]\n\n            Then, check for every pair of segments (i, j) (with i < j) if they intersect.\n\n            If no intersection is found, output 'Yes' and break out.\n\n        If no permutation is valid, output 'No'.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not specify an order for the rebels. In our method, we are using the original order of the rebels. But the matching is arbitrary. \n\n   But wait: the rebels are distinct points, so the assignment is independent of the index. However, we are assigning the i-th rebel (as given) to the i-th base in the permutation. \n\n   But note: the rebels are given in an arbitrary order. We must consider that the rebels are fixed in their positions. \n\n   However, the condition of non-intersection is independent of the labeling of the rebels. But our method of iterating over the original order of the rebels is okay because we are generating all assignments (we are permuting the bases). \n\n   Example: \n        Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n        Bases: [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\n        We try the permutation [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)] for the bases, then we form the segments:\n\n            (0,0) -> (-2,1)\n            (2,0) -> (0,3)\n            (3,1) -> (2,2)\n\n        Then check if these three segments intersect.\n\n        How do we check for three segments? We check every pair: (0,0)->(-2,1) and (2,0)->(0,3); (0,0)->(-2,1) and (3,1)->(2,2); (2,0)->(0,3) and (3,1)->(2,2).\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        We'll write a helper function for the cross product (or orientation) and then the segment_intersect.\n\n   Let me test the segment_intersect function with the example.\n\n   Example: \n        Segment1: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n        Segment2: (2,0) to (0,3)\n\n        We can compute:\n\n            o1 = cross((0,0), (-2,1), (2,0)) \n                 = ( (2-0)*(1-0) - (0-0)*(-2-0) ) \n                 = (2*1 - 0) = 2\n\n            o2 = cross((0,0), (-2,1), (0,3))\n                 = ( (0-0)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(-2-0) )\n                 = (0 - 3*(-2)) = 6\n\n        Then, the first condition: o1 * o2 = 2 * 6 = positive -> not negative -> condition fails.\n\n        Now, let's check the other way:\n\n            o3 = cross((2,0), (0,3), (0,0))\n                 = ( (0-2)*(3-0) - (0-0)*(2-0) ) \n                 = (-2*3 - 0) = -6\n\n            o4 = cross((2,0), (0,3), (-2,1))\n                 = ( (-2-2)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(0-2) )\n                 = (-4*3 - 1*(-2)) = -12 + 2 = -10\n\n        Then, o3 * o4 = (-6)*(-10) = positive -> condition fails.\n\n        So the function returns False (not intersecting) for these two segments.\n\n        Now, check the other two pairs.\n\n        Segment1: (0,0) to (-2,1) and Segment3: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\n        o1 = cross((0,0), (-2,1), (3,1)) \n            = (3-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(-2-0) = 3*1 - 1*(-2) = 3+2 = 5\n        o2 = cross((0,0), (-2,1), (2,2))\n            = (2-0)*(1-0) - (2-0)*(-2-0) = 2*1 - 2*(-2) = 2+4=6\n\n        Then, condition for segment1 and segment3: 5*6>0 -> fails.\n\n        Then, segment2: (2,0) to (0,3) and segment3: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\n        o1 = cross((2,0), (0,3), (3,1))\n            = (3-2)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(0-2) = (1*3) - (1*(-2)) = 3+2=5\n        o2 = cross((2,0), (0,3), (2,2))\n            = (2-2)*(3-0) - (2-0)*(0-2) = 0 - 2*(-2)=4\n\n        Then, condition: 5*4>0 -> fails.\n\n        So the entire matching is non-intersecting.\n\n        However, we must verify if the example is indeed non-intersecting.\n\n        Plot the points:\n\n          Rebel1: (0,0) -> Base1: (-2,1)\n          Rebel2: (2,0) -> Base2: (0,3)\n          Rebel3: (3,1) -> Base3: (2,2)\n\n        Draw the segments:\n\n          From (0,0) to (-2,1): goes left-up.\n          From (2,0) to (0,3): goes left-up, but starts from (2,0) and goes to (0,3).\n          From (3,1) to (2,2): goes left-up.\n\n        Do the segments cross?\n\n        Segment1: (0,0) to (-2,1): equation: from (0,0) to (-2,1): slope = (1-0)/(-2-0) = -0.5\n        Segment2: (2,0) to (0,3): equation: from (2,0) to (0,3): slope = (3-0)/(0-2) = -1.5\n\n        They are two lines with different slopes. They might intersect.\n\n        Let me calculate the intersection of segment1 and segment2:\n\n          Line1: y = -0.5*x\n          Line2: y = -1.5*(x-2)   [because from (2,0) to (0,3): y-0 = -1.5(x-2)]\n\n          Set -0.5*x = -1.5*(x-2)\n          => -0.5x = -1.5x + 3\n          => x = 3 / (1.5-0.5) = 3/1 = 3\n\n          Then y = -0.5*3 = -1.5\n\n        The intersection is at (3, -1.5). But the segments are:\n\n          Segment1: from (0,0) to (-2,1): x from -2 to 0, so x=3 is outside.\n          Segment2: from (2,0) to (0,3): x from 0 to 2, so x=3 is outside.\n\n        So they do not intersect.\n\n        Similarly, the other two segments:\n\n          Segment1: (0,0) to (-2,1) and Segment3: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\n          Segment1: equation: y = -0.5x\n          Segment3: from (3,1) to (2,2): equation: y - 1 = ( (2-1)/(2-3) )*(x-3) = (1/-1)*(x-3) = -x+3 -> y = -x+4\n\n          Intersection: -0.5x = -x+4 -> 0.5x=4 -> x=8, y=-4 -> outside both segments.\n\n          Segment2 and Segment3:\n\n          Segment2: y = -1.5x+3 (from (2,0): 0=-1.5*2+3 -> 0=-3+3 -> yes; (0,3): 3=-1.5*0+3 -> yes)\n          Segment3: y = -x+4\n\n          Intersection: -1.5x+3 = -x+4 -> -0.5x = 1 -> x=-2, y=-(-2)+4=6 -> outside.\n\n        So the example is indeed non-intersecting.\n\n        Therefore, the brute-force should work.\n\n   Code structure:\n\n        import itertools\n\n        def cross(o, a, b):\n            return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between the spaceships and bases to see if any permutation results in non-intersecting segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a perfect matching (one-to-one assignment) between R spaceships and B bases such that no two connecting segments intersect. The key observation is that if the number of spaceships (R) does not equal the number of bases (B), no perfect matching exists, and we can immediately return \"No\". Otherwise, we proceed to check all possible assignments.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible permutation of base assignments to spaceships, we need to verify that none of the segments connecting them intersect. The intersection check between two line segments is done using the cross product to determine their relative orientation, ensuring they do not cross each other.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Given the constraints (R and B up to 10), a brute-force approach is feasible. We generate all permutations of base assignments and for each permutation, check all pairs of segments for intersections. If any permutation yields no intersections, we return \"Yes\"; otherwise, after checking all permutations, we return \"No\".\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The number of permutations is R! (factorial of R), which for R=10 is 3,628,800. For each permutation, we check C(R, 2) segment pairs (approximately 45 checks for R=10). Each check involves a constant-time cross product calculation, making the overall complexity manageable for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    R = int(next(it)); B = int(next(it))\n    \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(next(it)); y = int(next(it))\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(next(it)); y = int(next(it))\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    def cross(o, a, b):\n        return (a[0] - o[0]) * (b[1] - o[1]) - (a[1] - o[1]) * (b[0] - o[0])\n        \n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        o1 = cross(a, b, c)\n        o2 = cross(a, b, d)\n        o3 = cross(c, d, a)\n        o4 = cross(c, d, b)\n        if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n            return True\n        return False\n        \n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            seg = (rebels[i], perm[i])\n            segments.append(seg)\n            \n        valid = True\n        n = len(segments)\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                p1, p2 = segments[i]\n                p3, p4 = segments[j]\n                if segments_intersect(p1, p2, p3, p4):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, parsing the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B).
