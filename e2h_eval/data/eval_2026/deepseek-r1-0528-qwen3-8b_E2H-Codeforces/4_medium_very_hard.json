The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (losses) for both players over n rounds.\n The game is played with two cyclic sequences A and B of length m and k respectively.\n\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Idea:\n We note that the outcome of a round depends on the current character from A and B.\n\n The rules:\n   Rock ('R') beats 'S'\n   Scissors ('S') beats 'P'\n   Paper ('P') beats 'R'\n\n And if they choose the same, it's a draw.\n\n We can define a function that, given two characters, returns:\n   -1 if first wins (so no red spot for first, but second gets one)\n    0 if draw\n    1 if first loses (so first gets a red spot)\n\n However, note: \n   In the problem, the red spots are given to the loser. So if Nikephoros loses, then he gets a red spot; similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n But note: the input gives two sequences: \n   Nikephoros uses sequence A (cyclically) and Polycarpus uses sequence B (cyclically).\n\n In round i (0-indexed), we use:\n   a_i = A[i % m]\n   b_i = B[i % k]\n\n Then, we can break down the problem:\n\n For a fixed round i, we have two indices: i mod m for A, and i mod k for B.\n\n We can consider the entire set of rounds as being partitioned by the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k, but note: n might not be an integer multiple of LCM(m,k). However, we can use the following:\n\n Let T = LCM(m, k). Then, the pattern of rounds repeats every T rounds (if we look at the pair (A[i % m], B[i % k])). But note: the actual outcomes are independent for each round and the sequence of pairs (a, b) is periodic with period T.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the period T = LCM(m, k). But note: m and k are at most 1000, so T <= 4000000? Actually, worst-case m=1000, k=1000, then LCM(1000,1000)=1000, but wait: 1000 and 1000 have LCM=1000. However, the LCM of two numbers a and b is (a * b) / GCD(a,b). The maximum value would be 1000*1000 / 1 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n 2. We can precompute the outcome for one period (i.e., for i from 0 to T-1) and then multiply by the number of full periods, and then handle the remaining rounds.\n\n However, note: n can be very large (up to 2e9) and T might be up to 1e6 (which is acceptable for storing the outcomes for one period). But then the total rounds is n, so we can do:\n\n   Let total_rounds = n\n   Let period_length = T = LCM(m, k)\n   full_periods = n // T\n   remainder = n % T\n\n 3. Then, we can compute the total losses for Nikephoros (let's call it loss_nike) and Polycarpus (loss_poly) in one period.\n\n 4. Then, total loss for Nikephoros = full_periods * loss_nike_period + loss_nike_in_remainder\n   Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n But wait: How to compute the outcome for a given round i?\n\n We need a function that given two characters (x from A and y from B) returns:\n   If x beats y: then no loss for Nikephoros, but one loss for Polycarpus? Actually, wait:\n\n   The rule: \n        Rock beats scissors -> so if Nikephoros shows 'R' and Polycarpus shows 'S', then Nikephoros wins -> so Polycarpus loses (gets a red spot).\n        Similarly, if Nikephoros shows 'S' and Polycarpus shows 'R', then Nikephoros loses.\n\n   So we can define:\n\n        outcome(nike_char, poly_char) -> \n            if (nike_char, poly_char) is (win, lose) then return (0, 1) meaning Nikephoros doesn't get a spot and Polycarpus does.\n            else if (nike_char, poly_char) is (lose, win) then return (1, 0)\n            else (draw): (0,0)\n\n   But note the mapping:\n\n        R vs S: R wins -> (0,1)\n        R vs P: R loses -> (1,0)\n        R vs R: (0,0)\n\n        S vs R: S loses -> (1,0)\n        S vs P: S wins -> (0,1)\n        S vs S: (0,0)\n\n        P vs R: P wins -> (0,1)\n        P vs S: P loses -> (1,0)\n        P vs P: (0,0)\n\n Alternatively, we can define a helper function:\n\n   def outcome(x, y):\n        if x == y:\n            return (0, 0)\n        # Now they are different\n        # Define the beating relations: \n        # We can say: \n        #   'R' beats 'S'\n        #   'S' beats 'P'\n        #   'P' beats 'R'\n\n        # So if x beats y, then x wins -> (0,1) [meaning: (Nikephoros doesn't lose, Polycarpus loses)]\n        # Otherwise, if y beats x, then x loses -> (1,0)\n\n        # Check: \n        #   x='R', y='S': R beats S -> (0,1) -> correct.\n        #   x='R', y='P': R loses to P -> (1,0) -> correct.\n        #   x='S', y='R': S loses to R -> (1,0) -> correct.\n        #   x='S', y='P': S beats P -> (0,1) -> correct.\n        #   x='P', y='R': P beats R -> (0,1) -> correct.\n        #   x='P', y='S': P loses to S -> (1,0) -> correct.\n\n        if (x, y) == ('R', 'S'):\n            return (0, 1)\n        elif (x, y) == ('S', 'P'):\n            return (0, 1)\n        elif (x, y) == ('P', 'R'):\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)\n\n But wait, there is a simpler way: we can map the outcomes to a cyclic order.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        mapping = {'R':0, 'S':1, 'P':2}\n\n        Then, we can define a cyclic order: \n          R (0) beats S (1) because 0 is followed by 1 and then 2, and then back to 0, and 0 beats 1 (the next one) and 1 beats 2 and 2 beats 0.\n\n        Then, the condition for x beats y is: (mapping[x] - mapping[y]) % 3 == 1? \n        Actually, if we arrange in circle: R->0, S->1, P->2, then the circle is 0->1->2->0.\n\n        Then, if we let x be the first and y the second, then x beats y if (mapping[x] - mapping[y]) % 3 == 1? \n\n        Example: \n            x='R' (0), y='S' (1): (0-1)%3 = (-1)%3 = 2 -> not 1.\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n            x beats y if (mapping[x] + 1) % 3 == mapping[y]? No.\n\n        Another way: \n            In the circle, if we move one step from x we get the one that beats x? Actually, the rule is: \n                R beats S -> so from R, moving one step forward (clockwise) is S, but then R beats the one that is next? Actually, no.\n\n        Actually, we can define the relation as: \n            x beats y if (mapping[x] + 1) % 3 == mapping[y] is not true.\n\n        Let me try: \n            We want: \n                R (0) beats S (1): 0 beats 1 -> but (0+1)%3=1, which is S -> so if we say: \n                x beats y if (mapping[x] + 1) % 3 == mapping[y] then R beats S -> yes, but then S (1) should beat P (2): (1+1)%3=2 -> yes. Then P (2) should beat R (0): (2+1)%3=0 -> yes.\n\n        However, wait: the circle is: R->S->P->R. Then the rule is: the next element in the circle (clockwise) is beaten by the previous? Actually, the rule is: \n            R beats S (the next one) -> so the next one is the one that is beaten by the current.\n\n        But then, what about the reverse? \n            We also have: S is beaten by R, and P is beaten by S, and R is beaten by P.\n\n        Actually, we can define: \n            x beats y if (mapping[x] + 1) % 3 == mapping[y] OR (mapping[x] + 1) % 3 != mapping[y] but wait, that doesn't hold.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check: \n            x beats y if (mapping[x] + 1) % 3 == mapping[y] then that means x beats y only when y is the next one? But then R beats S (which is the next one) -> correct. Then S beats P (next one) -> correct. Then P beats R (next one) -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the rule says: \n            R beats S, S beats P, P beats R.\n\n        This is exactly the next element in the cycle. \n\n        So we can define: \n            x beats y if (mapping[x] + 1) % 3 == mapping[y] -> then (x,y) is a winning pair for x.\n\n        But wait: the rule says: \n            x beats y if y is the next element? Then the next element is the one that is beaten by x. \n\n        However, in the problem, if we have (x,y) = (R, S): x wins -> so we want to know if x wins, then (mapping[x]+1)%3 == mapping[y]. \n\n        But note: in the example above, that holds.\n\n        However, we must note: the circle has three elements and the next element is defined modulo 3.\n\n        Then, we can write:\n\n            mapping = {'R':0, 'S':1, 'P':2}\n            def outcome(x, y):\n                x_map = mapping[x]\n                y_map = mapping[y]\n                if x_map == y_map:\n                    return (0,0)\n                # Check if x beats y: \n                if (x_map + 1) % 3 == y_map:\n                    # Then x wins, so Polycarpus loses -> (0,1)\n                    return (0,1)\n                else:\n                    # Then y beats x? Actually, we know they are different, so the other possibility is that y beats x? \n                    # Because the circle is cyclic: the only two possibilities are either x beats y or y beats x.\n                    # So if not (x beats y) then y beats x.\n                    return (1,0)\n\n        Let's test with (R, S): (0,1) -> (0+1)%3=1 -> matches, returns (0,1) -> correct.\n        (R, P): (0,2) -> (0+1)%3=1 !=2 -> so returns (1,0) -> correct.\n        (S, R): (1,0) -> (1+1)%3=2 !=0 -> so returns (1,0) -> correct.\n        (S, P): (1,2) -> (1+1)%3=2 -> matches, returns (0,1) -> correct.\n        (P, R): (2,0) -> (2+1)%3=0 -> matches, returns (0,1) -> correct.\n        (P, S): (2,1) -> (2+1)%3=0 !=1 -> returns (1,0) -> correct.\n\n        So this works.\n\n 5. Now, we can precompute for one period (T = LCM(m,k)) the total losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let m = len(A), k = len(B)\n   T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // GCD(m, k)\n\n   Then, for i in range(T):\n        j = i % m   # index in A\n        l = i % k   # index in B\n        a_char = A[j]\n        b_char = B[l]\n        (n_loss, p_loss) = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n\n        Then, add n_loss to total_nike_losses in the period, and p_loss to total_poly_losses in the period.\n\n   Then, the number of full periods is full = n // T\n        remainder = n % T\n\n   Then, we simulate the remaining rounds (from 0 to remainder-1) and add the losses.\n\n   But note: T can be up to about 1e6, and we are going to do two loops: one for full periods (we don't simulate, just multiply) and one for the remainder (which is < T). Since T is at most 1e6, the remainder loop is at most 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n 6. However, we must compute T = LCM(m, k). We can compute GCD using Euclidean algorithm.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   import math\n   gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n   T = (m * k) // gcd_val\n\n 7. But note: the problem constraints say m, k <= 1000, so T is at most 1000*1000//1 = 1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n 8. Then, we do:\n\n   total_nike = 0\n   total_poly = 0\n\n   # Precompute one period\n   period_nike = 0\n   period_poly = 0\n\n   # Build a list for one period? Or we can simulate without storing the whole period if we use modulus indexing.\n   # We'll iterate i from 0 to T-1.\n\n   for i in range(T):\n        idx_a = i % m\n        idx_b = i % k\n        a_char = A[idx_a]\n        b_char = B[idx_b]\n        result = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n        period_nike += result[0]\n        period_poly += result[1]\n\n   Then, full_periods = n // T\n   remainder = n % T\n\n   Then, we simulate the first 'remainder' rounds (from 0 to remainder-1) to get additional losses.\n\n   But note: we can avoid building the entire period array if we use the same outcome function and modulus indexing.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute an array for the period and then use:\n\n        total_nike = full_periods * period_nike + simulate_rounds(remainder, A, B)[0]\n        total_poly = full_periods * period_poly + simulate_rounds(remainder, A, B)[1]\n\n   But wait, the outcome function already tells us the two values. We can write a helper function for the remainder rounds.\n\n   However, to avoid duplicating code, we can write:\n\n        def simulate_round(i, A, B):\n            idx_a = i % len(A)\n            idx_b = i % len(B)\n            return outcome(A[idx_a], B[idx_b])\n\n        Then for the remainder part, we do:\n\n        remainder_nike = 0\n        remainder_poly = 0\n        for i in range(remainder):\n            res = simulate_round(i, A, B)\n            remainder_nike += res[0]\n            remainder_poly += res[1]\n\n   But note: the outcome function uses the mapping dictionary. We have defined:\n\n        mapping = {'R':0, 'S':1, 'P':2}\n\n        Then, in outcome(x,y):\n\n        However, we must define mapping outside.\n\n 9. However, note: the input is given as strings. We assume the input is uppercase.\n\n 10. Let's code accordingly.\n\n But note: There is a caveat: the LCM might be large, but we are iterating T times (which is at most 1e6) so that's acceptable.\n\n However, we can optimize by not iterating the entire period if we use frequency counts? \n\n Alternative approach: Instead of iterating over T, we can consider all pairs (i, j) where i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1] and then count the number of times each pair (a_i, b_j) appears in the period.\n\n How many times does a particular pair (a, b) appear in the period? \n\n   The period is T = LCM(m,k). The sequence of A is repeated (k) times? Actually, the sequence of A is repeated (k) times? Not exactly. The period is T, so the index i runs from 0 to T-1.\n\n   The pair (a_i, b_j) corresponds to indices i such that:\n        i % m = i0 and i % k = j0.\n\n   The number of i in [0, T-1] such that i % m = i0 and i % k = j0 is 1, because the system of congruences:\n\n        i ≡ i0 (mod m)\n        i ≡ j0 (mod k)\n\n   has a unique solution modulo T (since T is LCM(m,k)). Therefore, each pair (i0, j0) appears exactly once per period.\n\n   But wait: the pairs (a_i, b_j) are determined by the indices (i0, j0). However, the outcome function depends on the characters, not the indices. So we can group by the characters.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        Count the frequency of each pair (char1, char2) in the set of all (a_i, b_j) for i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1] (but note: the period is T, and T is the LCM, and the pairs (a_i, b_j) for i from 0 to m-1 and j from 0 to k-1 form a complete residue system? Actually, no: the entire period T is the LCM, and the set of pairs (i%m, i%k) for i from 0 to T-1 is the same as the set of pairs (i0, j0) with i0 in [0, m-1] and j0 in [0, k-1]? \n\n        Actually, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem (for two moduli), the set {i in [0, T-1]} is in bijection with pairs (i0, j0) with i0 in [0, m-1] and j0 in [0, k-1]. So each pair (i0, j0) appears exactly once.\n\n   Therefore, the entire period is equivalent to having each combination of an index from A and an index from B exactly once.\n\n   Then, we can do:\n\n        Let M = {}\n        For i in range(m):\n            for j in range(k):\n                a_char = A[i]\n                b_char = B[j]\n                count = 1   # because each (i,j) appears once in the period\n                Then update a dictionary that maps (a_char, b_char) to the count.\n\n        Then, we can compute the outcome for each distinct (a_char, b_char) and then multiply by the count.\n\n        But note: the outcome function returns two numbers (n_loss, p_loss). Then, the total losses for one period would be:\n\n            period_nike = 0\n            period_poly = 0\n            for (char1, char2), cnt in frequency_dict.items():\n                for _ in range(cnt):\n                    # But we can simply: \n                    #   add outcome(char1, char2)[0] to period_nike\n                    #   add outcome(char1, char2)[1] to period_poly\n\n            But since cnt is 1 for each (char1, char2) (because each (i,j) is distinct and there are m*k pairs, and T = LCM(m,k) is at least max(m,k) and we have m*k distinct pairs? Actually, no: the same character pair (a_char, b_char) might appear multiple times if the same letter appears in multiple positions.\n\n        Actually, the pairs (a_char, b_char) are determined by the letters, not the indices. So we must count the frequency of the letter pairs.\n\n        But wait: the period is T = LCM(m,k) and the entire set of pairs (A[i], B[j]) for i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1] is exactly the set of all pairs (a_char, b_char) that occur in the two sequences, and each pair (i,j) is distinct. However, the same letter pair (a_char, b_char) might appear multiple times if the sequences have duplicate letters.\n\n        Actually, we are iterating over each index i (from 0 to m-1) and each index j (from 0 to k-1). So the total number of pairs is m*k, and T = LCM(m,k) is the period. And note: the period T is the least common multiple, and we know that the set of residues (i mod m, j mod k) for i,j running independently from 0 to T-1 is not the same as the set of residues (i mod m, j mod k) for i from 0 to T-1 (with j being the same as i mod k? Actually, no: our period is defined by the combined cycle, so we are effectively enumerating each (i0, j0) with i0 in [0, m-1] and j0 in [0, k-1] exactly once. Therefore, the entire period T = LCM(m,k) is the least common multiple and we have exactly m*k distinct pairs (i0, j0) but wait: actually, the number of distinct (i0, j0) is m*k, and the period T is the LCM, and we have T = LCM(m,k) >= m*k? Actually, no: LCM(m,k) is at least max(m,k) and can be larger than m*k? \n\n        Example: m=2, k=3 -> LCM(2,3)=6, and m*k=6 -> same.\n        Example: m=2, k=4 -> LCM(2,4)=4, and m*k=8 -> so T=4, but we have 8 pairs. Then, how many times does a particular (i0, j0) appear? \n\n        Actually, the system: \n            i ≡ i0 (mod m)\n            i ≡ j0 (mod k)\n\n        has a solution i modulo T (where T = LCM(m,k)), and the solutions are i = i0 + t*m = j0 + s*k, and the smallest nonnegative solution is in [0, T-1]. Then, the entire period of T rounds covers exactly one complete set of residues (i0, j0) for i0 in [0, m-1] and j0 in [0, k-1]? \n\n        But note: the set of pairs (i0, j0) is the set of residues modulo m and modulo k. The total number of distinct pairs (i0, j0) is m*k, and the period T is the LCM, which is the least common multiple. The number of solutions for i in [0, T-1] is T, and we have T = LCM(m,k). The number of distinct pairs (i0, j0) is m*k, and T might be less than m*k? \n\n        Actually, the condition for the existence of a solution for the system (for a fixed (i0, j0)) is that i0 mod g = j0 mod g, where g = GCD(m,k). \n\n        But we are iterating i from 0 to T-1, and we are taking i0 = i % m and j0 = i % k. Then, the set of (i0, j0) we get is the set of pairs (x,y) such that x ≡ y (mod g). And the total number of such pairs in the complete residue system modulo T is T. \n\n        Therefore, the entire period T does not necessarily cover every possible (i0, j0) (which are m*k) if T < m*k. \n\n        So the alternative method of iterating over all (i0, j0) in [0, m-1] x [0, k-1] and then dividing by the frequency of each (x,y) in the period would be more complex.\n\n  Given that m, k <= 1000, and T = LCM(m,k) is at most 1e6, we can safely iterate T times.\n\n  However, we can do better by grouping the same (a_char, b_char) and then computing the frequency of that pair in the period.\n\n  Steps for the alternative:\n\n        Let g = gcd(m,k)\n        T = (m * k) // g\n\n        Then, the entire period has T rounds. The pairs (i0, j0) (with i0 from 0 to m-1, j0 from 0 to k-1) that satisfy i0 ≡ j0 (mod g) will appear exactly once, and the others do not appear.\n\n        But wait, we are generating the rounds by i from 0 to T-1, and the pair (i0, j0) is (i % m, i % k). The condition for the system to have a solution is that the residues are compatible modulo g. And the set of (i0, j0) that appear is the set of pairs (x,y) such that x ≡ y (mod g). The total number of such pairs is (m//g) * (k//g) * g? Actually, no. \n\n        Actually, the total number of pairs (i0, j0) in [0, m-1] x [0, k-1] with i0 ≡ j0 (mod g) is: \n            Let x run from 0 to g-1, then for each residue class r (0<=r<g), the number of i0 with i0 % g = r is floor((m+r)/g) ??? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            The set of (i0, j0) is the set of pairs (x,y) such that x % g = y % g.\n\n            For each residue r in [0, g-1]:\n                Number of i0 with i0 % g = r: ceil(m/g) or floor? \n                Actually, for residue r, the count is (m - r + g - 1) // g? \n\n        But note: we are not iterating by residue, and the problem is complex.\n\n  Considering the constraints (m,k <= 1000, T <= 1000000) and that we can iterate T times, we stick to the first method.\n\n  However, we can avoid iterating T times by using:\n\n        Let F be a dictionary for the entire period (for the letter pairs) with the condition that the letter pairs (a, b) that appear must come from the sequences A and B, and the frequency of the pair (a,b) is the number of indices i in [0, T-1] such that A[i%m] = a and B[i%k] = b.\n\n        But note: the period T is the LCM, and the sequence of indices for A is repeated (k // g) times? \n\n        Actually, we can compute the frequency of a letter pair (a,b) in the period by:\n\n            Let m1 = m // g, k1 = k // g, T = g * m1 * k1   (since LCM(m,k)=m*k//g = (m//g)*k, but actually LCM(m,k)=m*k//g, and note that m = g * m1, k = g * k1, then T = m1 * k * g // g? Actually, T = (m * k) // g = (g*m1 * g*k1) // g = g * m1 * k1.\n\n            The sequence A is repeated (k1) times? Actually, the entire period T = g * m1 * k1, and the sequence A has length m = g*m1, so the sequence A is repeated T/m = (g * m1 * k1) / (g*m1) = k1 times.\n\n            Similarly, B is repeated T/k = (g * m1 * k1) / (g*k1) = m1 times.\n\n        Then, the pair (a,b) appears:\n\n            Let countA[a] = number of times a appears in A.\n            Let countB[b] = number of times b appears in B.\n\n            Then, the total number of times (a,b) appears in the entire period is: \n\n                countA[a] * countB[b] * (number of cycles of A and B that align the residues appropriately?) \n\n        Actually, the alignment is tricky. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the idea of the Chinese Remainder Theorem: the entire period T is the LCM, and the pair (a,b) appears once for each solution i in [0, T-1] such that A[i%m]=a and B[i%k]=b.\n\n        The condition for i: \n            i % m = j, where A[j]=a, and i % k = l, where B[l]=b.\n\n        The number of solutions i in [0, T-1] for a fixed (j,l) is 1 (by the CRT, because T is the LCM). But note: j must be an index in A such that A[j]=a, and l must be an index in B such that B[l]=b. Then, the total frequency of (a,b) is the number of pairs (j,l) (with j in [0, m-1] and l in [0, k-1]) such that A[j]=a and B[l]=b, and such that j ≡ l (mod g)? \n\n        Actually, the system for i: \n            i ≡ j (mod m)\n            i ≡ l (mod k)\n\n        has a solution i modulo T if and only if j ≡ l (mod g). \n\n        Therefore, the frequency of (a,b) is:\n\n            freq = 0\n            For each j such that A[j]==a:\n                For each l such that B[l]==b:\n                    if j % g == l % g:\n                        then there is exactly one solution i in [0, T-1] for the system (since T is the LCM, and the system has a solution if and only if j ≡ l mod g).\n\n            Then, the total frequency of (a,b) is the number of pairs (j,l) satisfying A[j]=a, B[l]=b, and j ≡ l (mod g).\n\n        Then, we can precompute:\n\n            countA = {char: []}   # list of indices j where A[j]==char\n            countB = {char: []}   # list of indices l where B[l]==char\n\n        Then, for a given (a,b):\n\n            j_list = countA.get(a, [])\n            l_list = countB.get(b, [])\n\n            Then, for each j in j_list, we require that there exists an l in l_list such that j % g == l % g.\n\n            Actually, we can precompute for each residue r in [0, g-1] the list of indices j in A with residue r and similarly for B.\n\n        Then, the frequency of (a,b) is: \n\n            count = 0\n            residue = j % g   for any j in A with a, but we don't know j. Actually, we can break:\n\n            Let for a given a, we have the set of residues for indices j in A: \n                residues_A[a] = { j % g for j in countA[a] }\n\n            Similarly for B.\n\n            Then, for (a,b) to appear, we need that there exists a residue r such that r is in residues_A[a] and r is in residues_B[b]. But note, the condition is that for a particular j (with A[j]=a) and particular l (with B[l]=b), we require j % g == l % g.\n\n            Then, the frequency is: \n\n                For each residue r that is common to both a and b, then the number of j in A with A[j]=a and j % g = r is (say) cntA_r, and the number of l in B with B[l]=b and l % g = r is cntB_r, then the total for residue r is cntA_r * cntB_r.\n\n            Then, total_frequency = sum_{r in common_residues} (cntA_r * cntB_r)\n\n        Then, the losses for (a,b) in the period is: \n\n            total_nike_period += total_frequency * outcome(a,b)[0]\n            total_poly_period += total_frequency * outcome(a,b)[1]\n\n        This avoids iterating T times.\n\n  But note: the problem says m, k <= 1000, so we can also do:\n\n        g = gcd(m,k)\n        T = (m*k)//g\n\n        Build:\n            countA_by_residue = [dict() for _ in range(g)]\n            # Or: for each residue r, we want to know the count of each char in A at indices j with j % g = r.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n            countA = {}  # key: (char, residue) -> count\n\n            For j in range(m):\n                char = A[j]\n                r = j % g\n                update countA[(char, r)] += 1\n\n            Similarly for B.\n\n        Then, for each char a and char b:\n\n            total = 0\n            for r in range(g):\n                if (a, r) in countA and (b, r) in countB:\n                    total += countA[(a,r)] * countB[(b,r)]\n\n            Then, use outcome(a,b) multiplied by total.\n\n        Then, we can iterate over all distinct (a,b) pairs. The distinct (a,b) pairs: there are at most 3*3=9 types.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute g = gcd(m,k)\n            Step 2: Precompute countA: dictionary with keys (char, residue) for residue in [0, g-1] and char in ['R','S','P']\n            Step 3: Similarly for B.\n            Step 4: For each char1 in ['R','S','P'] and each char2 in ['R','S','P']:\n                    total_freq = 0\n                    for r in range(g):\n                        key1 = (char1, r)\n                        key2 = (char2, r)\n                        if key1 in countA and key2 in countB:\n                            total_freq += countA[key1] * countB[key2]\n                    Then, add total_freq * outcome(char1, char2) to the period losses.\n\n        This is efficient because g is at most 1000 (actually, g is at most 1000) but the outer loop is 9 * 1000 = 9000, which is acceptable.\n\n  But wait: the residue r is in [0, g-1], and g can be up to 1000, so 9 * 1000 = 9000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, we must consider that the outcome function is defined for any pair (char1, char2) even if they don't appear, but we are only iterating over the ones that appear? Actually, we are iterating over all 9 pairs regardless. But we can also skip pairs that don't appear in A or B? \n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate over the set of chars that appear in A and B.\n\n        Let chars_A = set(A)\n        Let chars_B = set(B)\n\n        Then, for char1 in chars_A, char2 in chars_B.\n\n        Then, the inner loop is |chars_A| * |chars_B| * g. Since |chars_A|, |chars_B| <= 1000 (but actually the set of chars is at most 3, so 3*3*g = 9*g, which is <= 9000).\n\n  Since the alphabet is only 3 letters, we can simply do:\n\n        chars = ['R','S','P']\n\n        countA = {}\n        for r in range(g):\n            for char in chars:\n                countA[(char, r)] = 0   # we can initialize, but then we can just build from the string.\n\n        Actually, we can build without initializing:\n\n        count",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) for both players in a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors played over `n` rounds, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge lies in efficiently computing the results for a large number of rounds without simulating each round individually, leveraging periodic patterns in the sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players using cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each player's sequence. The goal is to count the total losses (red spots) after `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat cyclically, so the outcomes of rounds will also repeat periodically. The period is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This allows us to compute the results for one period and then extrapolate for the entire duration.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **GCD and LCM Calculation**: Compute the GCD of the sequence lengths to determine the period (LCM).\n   - **Frequency Counting**: For each possible move pair (a, b), count how many times they appear in the period. This involves checking the residues of indices modulo the GCD to ensure alignment in the sequences.\n   - **Outcome Calculation**: For each move pair, use predefined rules to determine the loser (and thus the increment in red spots) and multiply by the frequency of the pair in the period.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` (up to 2·10^9) by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences. The algorithm processes the period in O(m*k) time, where m and k are the sequence lengths (up to 1000), making it feasible for large inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n    \n    mapping = {'R':0, 'S':1, 'P':2}\n    \n    def outcome(x, y):\n        if x == y:\n            return (0, 0)\n        x_val = mapping[x]\n        y_val = mapping[y]\n        if (x_val + 1) % 3 == y_val:\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)\n            \n    countA_dict = {}\n    for r in range(g):\n        for char in ['R', 'S', 'P']:\n            countA_dict[(char, r)] = 0\n            \n    for idx, char in enumerate(A):\n        r = idx % g\n        countA_dict[(char, r)] += 1\n        \n    countB_dict = {}\n    for r in range(g):\n        for char in ['R', 'S', 'P']:\n            countB_dict[(char, r)] = 0\n            \n    for idx, char in enumerate(B):\n        r = idx % g\n        countB_dict[(char, r)] += 1\n        \n    total_nike = 0\n    total_poly = 0\n    chars = ['R', 'S', 'P']\n    \n    for char1 in chars:\n        for char2 in chars:\n            freq = 0\n            for r in range(g):\n                key1 = (char1, r)\n                key2 = (char2, r)\n                if key1 in countA_dict and key2 in countB_dict:\n                    freq += countA_dict[key1] * countB_dict[key2]\n            res = outcome(char1, char2)\n            total_nike += freq * res[0]\n            total_poly += freq * res[1]\n            \n    full_periods = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    if remainder > 0:\n        for i in range(remainder):\n            idx_a = i % m\n            idx_b = i % k\n            a_char = A[idx_a]\n            b_char = B[idx_b]\n            res = outcome(a_char, b_char)\n            total_nike += res[0]\n            total_poly += res[1]\n            \n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The GCD of the sequence lengths `m` and `k` is computed to determine the period `T` (LCM of `m` and `k`).\n3. **Outcome Function**: This function checks the result of a round based on the two moves (rock, paper, or scissors) using predefined rules.\n4. **Frequency Counting**: For each residue class (modulo GCD), the code counts occurrences of each move in both sequences.
