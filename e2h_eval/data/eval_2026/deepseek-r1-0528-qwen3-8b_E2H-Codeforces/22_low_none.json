After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are reading the first line to get n and m.\n Then, we read the next n lines, each containing a string of m characters (without spaces).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll read the input as described.\n 2. For each subject (column), we can determine the maximum mark (from '1' to '9') for that subject.\n    However, note: if there are multiple students with the same maximum mark in a subject, then all those students are best at that subject.\n\n 3. But note: the problem says \"successful\" if there exists at least one subject where the student is the best.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    - We can precompute for each subject the maximum mark and the list of students (indices) who achieved that maximum mark (i.e., the best in that subject).\n    - Then, for each student, check if there is at least one subject in which he is among the best.\n\n 5. However, note: the input is given as a list of strings, each string is a row (student) and each character in the string is a mark for a subject.\n\n Example: \n   Input: ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'] \n   Actually, the example input is given as a string that contains the numbers. But note: the first line has two integers and then the next lines have the marks.\n\n Let's parse the input:\n\n   Example: \n      Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   Steps to parse:\n      Read the entire input. The first line: split to get n and m.\n      Then, read the next n lines, but note that the input might be given as a single string in the example? \n\n   Actually, the problem states: \n        The first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. \n        Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook.\n\n   So, we can do:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if not data: \n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        first_line = data[0].split()\n        n = int(first_line[0])\n        m = int(first_line[1])\n\n        # Then, we expect n lines after the first line\n        # But note: the example input is provided as a string that includes the newlines.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can read the rest of the lines from data[1:1+n]\n\n        grades = []\n        for i in range(1, 1+n):\n            # Each line is a string of m characters\n            s = data[i].strip()\n            if len(s) != m:\n                # It's possible that the line has extra spaces? The problem says no, but just in case we use strip.\n                # But the problem says: \"each containing m characters\", so we assume no extra spaces.\n                # If there are, we take the first m characters?\n                s = s[:m]\n            grades.append(s)\n\n 6. Now, we have a list `grades` of n strings, each of length m.\n\n 7. Let's create a list for each subject (each column) of the marks.\n\n    We can also think: for each column j, we want the maximum mark (as a character) and then the set (or list) of rows (students) that have that mark.\n\n    Alternatively, we can create an array `best_subjects` for each subject j: which students are best?\n\n    Steps:\n\n        best_in_subject = [set() for _ in range(m)]   # m subjects, each is a set of student indices\n\n        For student i (from 0 to n-1) and subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n            mark = grades[i][j]\n            max_mark_for_j = we don't know yet, but we can compute per column.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        # First, for each subject j, find the maximum mark (character) in that column.\n        max_marks = []   # for each subject j, store the max mark (as char) and then we can record which students have it.\n\n        # Or we can do in two steps: first, for each column j, get the maximum value.\n\n        max_per_subject = [0] * m   # but we'll use character comparison: since they are digits, we can compare by their integer value or by character? \n        # Actually, '9' > '1', so we can use the character directly.\n\n        # Step 1: for each subject j, find the maximum mark (as character) in that column.\n        for j in range(m):\n            col_max = grades[0][j]\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input values, which include the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook data where each student's marks for all subjects are provided as strings.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student. This involves iterating through each column (subject) of the gradebook to identify the maximum value.\n3. **Track Best Students**: For each subject, keep track of all students who achieved the highest mark. This helps in identifying which students are the best in specific subjects.\n4. **Count Successful Students**: For each student, check if they appear in the list of best students for any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grades = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        s = data[i].strip()\n        if len(s) > m:\n            s = s[:m]\n        elif len(s) < m:\n            s = s.ljust(m, '0')  # Pad with zeros if necessary, though problem states m characters\n        grades.append(s)\n    \n    best_per_subject = [set() for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    for j in range(m):\n        max_mark = grades[0][j]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grades[i][j] > max_mark:\n                max_mark = grades[i][j]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grades[i][j] == max_mark:\n                best_per_subject[j].add(i)\n                \n    successful_count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if any(student == i for subject_best in best_per_subject for student in subject_best):\n            successful_count += 1\n            \n    print(successful_count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads all input lines from standard input. The first line contains the number of students (n) and subjects (m). Subsequent lines contain the gradebook entries for each student.\n2. **Handling Input Data**: Each student's grade string is processed to ensure it matches the expected length (m characters). If a string is shorter, it is padded with zeros; if longer, it is truncated.\n3. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code scans all student entries to find the highest mark. This mark is stored, and all students achieving this mark are recorded in a set.\n4. **Checking Successful Students**: The code checks each student to see if they are part of any best student set for any subject. If they are, they are counted as successful.\n5. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input data, identifies the best students in each subject, and counts those who are successful based on the given criteria. The solution ensures optimal performance with clear and concise logic.",
