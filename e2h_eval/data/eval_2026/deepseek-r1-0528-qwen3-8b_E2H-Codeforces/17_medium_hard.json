He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, Ivan has given us a string of length n and we know all the prefixes and suffixes (each from length 1 to n-1) but we don't know which is which. We are to assign each of the 2n-2 strings to either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) such that:\n  - There are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes.\n  - The set of prefixes must form the set of all proper prefixes of some string of length n, and similarly for suffixes.\n\n However, note: It is guaranteed that there exists at least one string of length n that has the given set as its proper prefixes and suffixes.\n\n Observation:\n Since the string is of length n, the full string s must have two parts: a prefix and a suffix of length n-1? Actually, no: the proper prefixes and suffixes are of lengths from 1 to n-1.\n\n But note: the problem says \"It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\"\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the actual string be t (of length n). Then the proper prefixes are t[0:i] for i in [1, n-1] and the proper suffixes are t[i:] for i in [0, n-2] (so of length from 1 to n-1).\n\n Note: The entire set of given strings has exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n Important: The full string t can be thought of as having two overlapping parts when considering the two largest proper substrings (the two strings of length n-1). In fact, if we consider the two strings of length n-1, then one must be the prefix and the other must be the suffix of t. And note that the last n-2 characters of the prefix (which is t[0:n-1]) must match the first n-2 characters of the suffix (which is t[1:]).\n\n Therefore, the two strings of length n-1 must be such that the prefix's substring from index 0 to n-2 (i.e., the whole prefix without the last character) equals the suffix's substring from index 1 to n-1 (i.e., the whole suffix without the first character).\n\n So, let L = n-1. We have two strings of length L. Let them be A and B. Then if we assume A is the prefix and B is the suffix, then we require:\n   A[0:L-1] == B[1:L]\n\n Similarly, if we assume B is the prefix and A is the suffix, then we require:\n   B[0:L-1] == A[1:L]\n\n Now, since the problem says that there is at least one string consistent with the given set, one of these two conditions must hold for the two strings of length n-1.\n\n Moreover, the entire string t must be of the form: \n   If A is the prefix and B is the suffix: then t = A + ... and also t = ... + B. Since the prefix is A (length L) then t must start with A. The suffix is B (length L) so t must end with B. Therefore, the first L characters are A, and the last L characters are B. Then the entire string t must be of length n, and since n = L+1, we have:\n        t = A[0] + ... + A[L-1] + (then the next character, if any?) Actually, wait: n = L+1, so the string t has length L+1. Then the prefix of length L is A, and the suffix of length L is B. Then the first L+1 characters are A[0:L] and the last L+1 characters are B[0:L]. But note: the entire string t is of length L+1. Then the condition is that the entire string t is A (if we consider the prefix of length L) and then the suffix of length L must be the last L characters, which is t[1:L+1] (because t has indices 0 to L). \n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n   t = A (if we take the prefix of length L) and then the suffix of length L must be t[1:L+1]. But we know the suffix is B. So we require:\n        t[1:L+1] = B\n\n But t is A, so we require that A[1:L] = B[0:L-1] (since B has length L). This is the same condition as above.\n\n Similarly, if we take the other way: B is the prefix and A is the suffix, then t = B and the suffix is t[1:L+1] = A, so we require B[1:L] = A[0:L-1].\n\n So, the two strings of length n-1 must satisfy one of these two conditions.\n\n Now, how do we assign the rest?\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Group the given strings by their length.\n    For length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings.\n\n 2. Consider the two strings of length n-1. They must be assigned one as prefix and one as suffix. We can check the condition above to decide which is which.\n\n    Condition 1: Let the two strings of length n-1 be A and B.\n        Option 1: A is prefix, B is suffix -> A[0:n-2] == B[1:n-1] (both are strings of length n-2)\n        Option 2: B is prefix, A is suffix -> B[0:n-2] == A[1:n-1]\n\n    Since the problem guarantees at least one solution, one of these must hold.\n\n    But note: it is possible that both hold? Then we have two possibilities. However, the problem says \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\"\n\n 3. Once we assign the two strings of length n-1, we can use the following:\n\n    Suppose we assign A as the prefix (length n-1) and B as the suffix (length n-1). Then the full string must be:\n        t = A + (last character of the suffix) ? But wait: the suffix is B, and the full string is of length n. The prefix is the first n-1 characters (A) and the suffix is the last n-1 characters (B). Therefore, the full string must be:\n        t = A + (the last character of the full string, which is the last character of B, but wait: the full string is of length n, so the first part is A (n-1 chars) and then the next character is the last character of the full string. Also, the suffix is the last n-1 chars, so that would be the last n-1 chars of t. Therefore, we can also write t = (first character of B) + ... (but actually, the full string must be: the first n-1 characters is A, and the last n-1 characters is B. Then the full string is:\n            t[0] = A[0]\n            t[1] = A[1]\n            ...\n            t[n-2] = A[n-2]\n            t[n-1] = ??? \n\n        Actually, the full string has length n. The last n-1 characters (from index 1 to n-1) must be B. Therefore, the full string is:\n            t = A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[n-2] + (what?) \n\n        But we also know the last n-1 characters: from index 0 to n-2 (if we consider the full string) is not matching. Let me index from 0 to n-1.\n\n        The prefix of length n-1 is t[0:n-1] = A.\n        The suffix of length n-1 is t[1:n] = B.\n\n        Then the full string is:\n            t[0] = A[0]\n            t[1] = A[1] ... until t[n-2] = A[n-2] (from the prefix)\n            and from the suffix: t[1] = B[0], t[2]=B[1], ... , t[n-1]=B[n-2].\n\n        Therefore, we must have:\n            t[0] = A[0] (from prefix) and t[0] must be the same as the last character of B? Actually, the first character of the full string is A[0] and the second character is A[1] and also the second character is B[0]. So we require A[1] = B[0].\n\n        But wait, that's already covered by our condition: A[0:n-2] == B[1:n-1] because:\n            A[0:n-2] = A[0] to A[n-3] (length n-2)\n            B[1:n-1] = B[1] to B[n-2] (length n-2)\n\n        And we require A[0:n-2] == B[1:n-1]. But note the full string's second character is A[1] (from the prefix) and also B[0] (from the suffix). So we must have A[1] = B[0]. This is the first two characters of the condition.\n\n        Similarly, the third character: from the prefix: A[2] and from the suffix: B[1] must be equal, and so on until the second last character: A[n-2] must equal B[n-3] (if n-1 is the length). But note: the condition is A[0:n-2] == B[1:n-1] (which is from index0 to index n-3 of A equals from index1 to index n-2 of B). This ensures that from index1 to index n-2 of the full string (which is the same as from index0 to n-3 of A and from index1 to n-2 of B) is consistent.\n\n        Then the full string is determined: \n            t = A[0] + (then the rest from the suffix: but wait, we have the entire B, which is the last n-1 characters. The full string is:\n                t[0] = A[0]\n                t[1] = B[0]   (because the suffix is B and the second character is the first character of B)\n                t[2] = B[1]   (from the suffix) but also from the prefix: t[2] = A[2] (if n>=3) and we have the condition A[1]=B[0] and A[2]=B[1] etc.\n\n        Actually, the full string is built by taking the first character from A and then the rest from B (without the first character) for the remaining n-1 characters? No, because the full string has length n. Then:\n            t[0] = A[0]\n            t[1] = B[0]\n            t[2] = B[1]\n            ...\n            t[n-1] = B[n-2]\n\n        But then the prefix of length n-1 would be t[0:n-1] = A[0] + B[0] + B[1] + ... + B[n-3] (because n-1 total: the first character is A[0] and then the next n-2 characters are the first n-2 characters of B). \n\n        However, we are told that the prefix of length n-1 is A. So we require:\n            A = [A[0]] + [B[0]] + [B[1]] + ... + [B[n-3]]\n\n        But note: the length of A is n-1, so A has n-1 characters. Then we require:\n            A[0] = A[0]\n            A[1] = B[0]\n            A[2] = B[1]\n            ...\n            A[n-2] = B[n-3]\n\n        This is exactly the condition we had: A[0:n-2] = B[0:n-3] (wait, no: we have A[0] is independent, and then from A[1] to A[n-2] must equal B[0] to B[n-3]). But note: the condition we checked was A[0:n-2] == B[1:n-1] (which is of length n-2). But now we see that the correct condition is actually:\n\n            A[0] = ... (no constraint from the suffix's first character for the first character of A) but then from the second character of A (which is A[1]) we require it to be B[0]. Then from the third character of A (A[2]) we require it to be B[1], and so on until A[n-2] must be B[n-3]. \n\n        But note: the condition we checked earlier was for the entire n-2 characters of A (from index0 to n-3) to be equal to the entire n-2 characters of B (from index1 to n-2). However, in this construction, the first character of A (A[0]) is not constrained by B (except that the full string must start with A[0] and the second character is B[0] which is A[1]). \n\n        Let me reexamine the condition:\n\n            The full string t has length n.\n            The prefix of length n-1: t[0:n-1] = A.\n            The suffix of length n-1: t[1:n] = B.\n\n            Then:\n                t[0] = A[0]\n                t[1] = A[1] and also t[1] = B[0] -> so A[1] = B[0]\n                t[2] = A[2] and also t[2] = B[1] -> so A[2] = B[1]\n                ...\n                t[n-2] = A[n-2] and also t[n-2] = B[n-3] (because the suffix B starts at index1, so the character at index n-2 is the (n-2-1)th character of B? Actually, in the suffix, the character at position 1 (index1) is the first character of B, so the character at index k (k from 1 to n-1) is B[k-1]. Then the condition for the j-th character of A (for j from 1 to n-2) is that A[j] = B[j-1].\n\n            Now, what about the condition we initially thought: A[0:n-2] == B[1:n-1]? \n                A[0:n-2] is the string from index0 to index n-3 of A (length n-2)\n                B[1:n-1] is the string from index1 to index n-2 of B (length n-2)\n\n            But note: \n                A[0] is not included in the condition? Actually, we have:\n                Condition: A[0] is free? But then the full string must have the first character as A[0] and the second character as B[0] which is A[1]. However, the condition we checked was for the entire n-2 characters of A (from index0 to n-3) to be equal to the entire n-2 characters of B (from index1 to n-2). \n\n            But wait, the condition we need is actually:\n                For j from 0 to n-3: A[j+1] = B[j]   (because the j+1-th character of A is the same as the j-th character of B) for j from 0 to n-3 (so n-2 conditions). \n\n            However, the condition I wrote above (the one we checked initially) was: A[0:n-2] == B[1:n-1]. Let's break it down:\n\n                A[0:n-2] = [A[0], A[1], ..., A[n-3]]\n                B[1:n-1] = [B[1], B[2], ..., B[n-2]]\n\n            But note: from the full string, we have:\n                t[0] = A[0]\n                t[1] = A[1] = B[0]   -> so B[0] is fixed by A[1]\n                t[2] = A[2] = B[1]\n                ...\n                t[n-2] = A[n-2] = B[n-3]\n\n            Then the condition A[0:n-2] == B[1:n-1] becomes:\n                [A[0], A[1], A[2], ..., A[n-3]] == [B[1], B[2], ..., B[n-2]]\n\n            But from the full string, we know:\n                B[1] = A[2] (from t[2])\n                B[2] = A[3] (from t[3])\n                ...\n                B[n-3] = A[n-2] (from t[n-2])\n\n            However, the first element of the left side is A[0] and the first element of the right side is B[1] (which is A[2]). There is no direct relation between A[0] and B[1] from the condition. \n\n            So the condition we checked initially (A[0:n-2] == B[1:n-1]) is not sufficient? Actually, note that the condition we need is for the overlapping part: the full string's middle part (from index1 to index n-2) must be the same whether read from the prefix (as the substring starting at index1) or from the suffix (as the substring starting at index0). \n\n            Let me write the full string t: \n                t = A[0] + B[0] + B[1] + ... + B[n-3] + B[n-2]   (the last character is B[n-2])\n            But we also have the prefix: \n                t[0:n-1] = A[0] + B[0] + B[1] + ... + B[n-3]   (this is n-1 characters: from index0 to n-2)\n\n            And the prefix is given as A. So we require:\n                A[0] = A[0] (ok)\n                A[1] = B[0]\n                A[2] = B[1]\n                ...\n                A[n-2] = B[n-3]\n\n            Therefore, the condition is that the substring of A from index0 to index n-3 (i.e., the first n-2 characters of A) is not directly compared to B[1:n-1] (which is from index1 to n-2 of B). Instead, we have:\n\n                A[1] = B[0]\n                A[2] = B[1]\n                ...\n                A[n-2] = B[n-3]\n\n            This is equivalent to saying: A[1:] == B[0:n-2] (because A[1:] is the substring of A from index1 to the end, which is length n-2, and B[0:n-2] is the substring of B from index0 to n-3, which is also length n-2).\n\n            But note: the condition we initially stated (A[0:n-2] == B[1:n-1]) is different. \n\n            Let me compare:\n\n                Condition1: A[0:n-2] == B[1:n-1] \n                    -> [A[0], A[1], ..., A[n-3]] == [B[1], B[2], ..., B[n-2]]\n\n                Condition2: A[1:] == B[0:n-2] \n                    -> [A[1], A[2], ..., A[n-2]] == [B[0], B[1], ..., B[n-3]]\n\n            These are two different conditions.\n\n            But note: we have two ways to assign the two n-1 strings.\n\n            Actually, the problem statement said: the two strings of length n-1 must be the prefix and the suffix. Then the condition for the assignment (prefix A and suffix B) is that the entire prefix (A) and the entire suffix (B) must fit together to form a string of length n. The condition is that the last n-2 characters of the prefix (A without the first character) must equal the first n-2 characters of the suffix (B without the last character). That is:\n\n                A[1:] == B[:-1]\n\n            Which is the same as Condition2 above.\n\n            Therefore, the correct condition for the two strings of length n-1 is:\n                Option1: A is prefix, B is suffix -> A[1:] == B[:-1]   (i.e., A without the first character equals B without the last character)\n\n            Similarly, Option2: B is prefix, A is suffix -> B[1:] == A[:-1]\n\n            So we should check for the two strings of length n-1 (say X and Y):\n\n                Condition1: X[1:] == Y[:-1]   (then we assign X as prefix and Y as suffix)\n                Condition2: Y[1:] == X[:-1]   (then we assign Y as prefix and X as suffix)\n\n            Since the problem guarantees at least one solution, one of these holds.\n\n 4. After assigning the two n-1 length strings, how do we assign the others?\n\n    We know the entire string t (if we have the two n-1 strings correctly assigned). Then we can deduce the entire string t. Then, for each string in the input (each length from 1 to n-1) we can check:\n\n        For a string w of length l (l < n-1): \n            It must be a prefix of t of length l, or a suffix of t of length l.\n\n        But note: the set of prefixes and suffixes of t is exactly the set we are given. And the problem says that the given set is the set of proper prefixes and suffixes of t.\n\n        However, we don't know the entire t until we assign the two n-1 strings. But once we assign the two n-1 strings, we can build t as:\n\n            t = (first character of the prefix of length n-1) + (the rest from the suffix of length n-1 without the first character, but wait we have the entire suffix of length n-1, so actually we have the entire string from the two n-1 strings? \n\n            Actually, we have two ways to get the full string:\n\n            If we choose Option1: prefix = X, suffix = Y, then the full string t is:\n                t = X[0] + (then the rest of the string: we know the suffix is Y, so the full string must be such that the last n-1 characters are Y. But the first character is X[0] and the rest of the string (from index1 to the end) must be the same as the entire string without the first character, which is the prefix without the first character? \n\n            Alternatively, we can build the full string from the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1:\n\n                t = X[0] + (then we need to fill the next n-1 characters? Actually, the full string has length n. We know the first n-1 characters (X) and the last n-1 characters (Y). Then the full string is:\n\n                t = X[0] + ... + X[n-2]   (this is n-1 characters) and then we have the last character: but wait, the last n-1 characters are Y, so the last n-1 characters are from index1 to n-1. Therefore, the full string is:\n\n                t[0] = X[0]\n                t[1] = X[1] ... t[n-2] = X[n-2]\n                and from the suffix: t[1] = Y[0], t[2]=Y[1], ... , t[n-1]=Y[n-2]\n\n                Then the full string is:\n                    t[0] = X[0]\n                    t[1] = X[1] = Y[0]\n                    t[2] = X[2] = Y[1]\n                    ...\n                    t[n-1] = X[n-2] = Y[n-3]   (Wait, no: the last character is t[n-1] = Y[n-2] (from the suffix) and from the prefix, the last character of the prefix is X[n-2] which is t[n-2] (the second last of the full string). \n\n                Actually, the full string is:\n\n                    t = X[0] + (then the next n-2 characters are the entire Y without the last character? No, wait: the suffix Y is the last n-1 characters, so the full string is:\n\n                    t = X[0] + (a string of length n-1) but we don't know the entire middle part? \n\n                Let me write the full string:\n\n                    t[0] = X[0]\n                    t[1] = Y[0]   (from the suffix)\n                    t[2] = Y[1]\n                    ...\n                    t[n-1] = Y[n-2]\n\n                But then the prefix of length n-1 is t[0:n-1] = [X[0]] + [Y[0], Y[1], ..., Y[n-3]] (because the prefix is the first n-1 characters: from index0 to n-2). \n\n                We are given that the prefix of length n-1 is X. So we must have:\n\n                    X = [X[0]] + [Y[0], Y[1], ..., Y[n-3]]\n\n                This implies:\n\n                    X[0] = X[0] (ok)\n                    X[1] = Y[0]\n                    X[2] = Y[1]\n                    ...\n                    X[n-2] = Y[n-3]\n\n                And note: the last character of the full string is Y[n-2] (which we don't get from X).\n\n                Now, we can build the full string as:\n\n                    t = X + (last character of the suffix? But the full string is of length n, and we have:\n\n                    t = [X[0], X[1], ..., X[n-2], Y[n-2]]\n\n                But wait, we also have the condition that the suffix is Y, so the last n-1 characters are Y. The last n-1 characters are:\n\n                    t[1] to t[n-1] = [X[1], X[2], ..., X[n-2], Y[n-2]] \n\n                and this must equal Y. Therefore:\n\n                    Y[0] = X[1]\n                    Y[1] = X[2]\n                    ...\n                    Y[n-3] = X[n-2]\n                    Y[n-2] = ... (the last character of the full string, which we don't know from X) but we don't have a condition for that.\n\n                Actually, the full string is:\n\n                    t = [X[0], Y[0], Y[1], ..., Y[n-2]]   (with the condition that X[1] = Y[0], X[2] = Y[1], ...)\n\n                Then the entire string is determined by X and Y, and the only unknown is the first character of the full string (X[0]) and the last character (Y[n-2]) are independent? \n\n                But wait, the condition we checked was X[1:] == Y[:-1] (i.e., the substring of X from index1 to the end equals the substring of Y from index0 to the second last). Then the full string is:\n\n                    t = X[0] + Y[0] + Y[1] + ... + Y[n-2]\n\n                And the length is 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\n                Then, we can use this full string t to check the other given strings (of lengths from 1 to n-2).\n\n 5. Algorithm:\n\n    Step 1: Read n, then 2n-2 lines.\n\n    Step 2: Group the strings by length.\n\n    Step 3: Extract the two strings of length n-1. Check the two conditions:\n\n        cond1 = (len(X)==n-1 and len(Y)==n-1) and (X[1:] == Y[:-1])\n        cond2 = (len(X)==n-1 and len(Y)==n-1) and (Y[1:] == X[:-1])\n\n        Then, if cond1 holds, then we assign X as prefix and Y as suffix.\n        If cond2 holds, then we assign Y as prefix and X as suffix.\n\n        Since the problem guarantees at least one solution, one of these must hold.\n\n    Step 4: Build the full string t of length n:\n\n        If we chose cond1 (X is prefix, Y is suffix), then:\n            t = X[0] + Y   (because the full string must start with X[0] and then the entire suffix Y, because the suffix is the last n-1 characters, so the full string is X[0] followed by Y)\n\n        But wait, let me check: \n            Then the prefix of length n-1: t[0:n-1] = X[0] + Y[0:n-2] (because n-1 characters: first character is X[0], then the next n-2 characters are the first n-2 characters of Y) -> which is X[0] + Y[0:n-2]. But we were given that the prefix is X. So we require:\n\n                X = X[0] + Y[0:n-2]\n\n            And we have the condition from step 3: X[1:] == Y[:-1] -> which is the same as X[1:] = Y[0:n-2] (because Y[:-1] is Y[0:n-2] if n-1 is the length of Y). \n\n            So we have X = [X[0]] + [Y[0], Y[1], ..., Y[n-3]] (which is X[0] + Y[0:n-2]). This matches.\n\n        Then the full string is X[0] + Y, and its length is 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\n        Similarly, if we chose cond2 (Y is prefix, X is suffix), then the full string is Y[0] + X.\n\n    Step 5: Now, we have the full string t. Then, for each given string (each line) we need to determine if it is a prefix or a suffix.\n\n        But note: the input has 2n-2 strings, and we have already used two (the two of length n-1). The rest are of lengths from 1 to n-2.\n\n        For a string w of length l (l < n-1):\n\n            Check if w is a prefix of t of length l: that is, t[0:l] == w.\n            Or, check if w is a suffix of t of length l: that is, t[n-l: n] == w.\n\n        However, note: the set of prefixes and suffixes of t are exactly the given set. And the problem says that the given set is the set of proper prefixes and suffixes of t.\n\n        But wait: we built t from the two n-1 length strings. Then the set of proper prefixes and suffixes of t is fixed. And the given set is the same as the set we are given.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not guarantee that the two n-1 length strings are the only ones of their length? Actually, the input says: \"exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1\". So for each length l (from 1 to n-1) there are two strings.\n\n        But we have two strings of length n-1, and we have built t from them. Then for the other lengths, we can check:\n\n            For a string w of length l (l from 1 to n-2):\n\n                There are two possibilities: it is either a prefix (so t[0:l]==w) or a suffix (so t[n-l:n]==w). But note: the set of prefixes of t of length l is exactly {t[0:l]} and the set of suffixes of length l is {t[n-l:n]}. \n\n            However, the input gives two strings for each length l. One of them must be the prefix and the other must be the suffix? Not necessarily: it could be that both are present in the set of prefixes (if they are repeated) but the problem states that the set of proper prefixes and suffixes of t is given. And the set of proper prefixes of t is {t[0:1], t[0:2], ..., t[0:n-1]} and the set of proper suffixes is {t[1:n], t[2:n], ..., t[n-1:n]}. \n\n        But note: the two strings of length l must be the two that appear in t: one as a prefix and one as a suffix? Actually, no: the set of prefixes is fixed and the set of suffixes is fixed. And the input has two strings for each length, which are the two that appear (one from the prefix set and one from the suffix set) or maybe both from one set? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes\", meaning that the set of proper prefixes and suffixes (each of length from 1 to n-1) is given. And there are exactly two strings for each length. \n\n        But note: the set of proper prefixes of a string t of length n has exactly one string for each length from 1 to n-1 (the prefix of length l is t[0:l]). Similarly, the set of proper suffixes has one string for each length from 1 to n-1 (the suffix of length l is t[n-l:n]). \n\n        Therefore, for each length l, the two given strings must be the prefix of t of length l and the suffix of t of length l.\n\n        However, wait: what if the prefix and suffix of length l are the same? Then we would have two identical strings. But the problem says \"each of them is the string\" and they can be repeated? Actually, the input has two strings for each length, but they might be the same? \n\n        But the example: \n            Input: \n                2\n                a\n                c\n\n            Output: \n                PS\n\n        Here, n=2, so the two strings are of length 1. The two strings are \"a\" and \"c\". Then the full string must be either \"ac\" or \"ca\". \n\n        In the case of \"ac\": \n            Prefix of length1: \"a\"\n            Suffix of length1: \"c\"\n\n        In the case of \"ca\":\n            Prefix of length1: \"c\"\n            Suffix of length1: \"a\"\n\n        So the two given strings for length1 are the two letters. Then the two strings are distinct.\n\n        Therefore, for each length l, the two given strings are distinct and are exactly the two substrings: the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l.\n\n        So for a string w of length l, if w is the prefix of t of length l, then the other string of length l must be the suffix (unless the prefix and suffix happen to be the same? but the problem says they are distinct). \n\n        However, the problem does not say that the two strings for a given length are distinct. But the example input has distinct strings. And the guarantee: \"each of them is the string of length from 1 to n-1\" and \"exactly two strings of each length\", and the fact that they are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n, and the example outputs, suggest that for each length l, the two strings are distinct.\n\n        But note: it is possible that the prefix and suffix of length l are the same? Then we would have two identical strings for that length. However, the problem says: \"exactly two strings of each length\", so duplicates are allowed? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not explicitly forbid duplicates. But note the example: \n            Input: \n                3\n                a\n                aa\n                aa\n                a\n\n            Output: \n                PPSS\n\n        Here, for length1: two strings \"a\" and \"a\" (duplicate) and for length2: two strings \"aa\" and \"aa\" (duplicate). \n\n        But wait, the example input format is:\n\n            ['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n        The second example input is:\n\n            3\n            a\n            aa\n            aa\n            a\n\n        So yes, duplicates are allowed.\n\n        Therefore, for a given length l, we have two strings. They might be the same. Then how do we assign?\n\n        Actually, if the two strings of length l are the same, then the prefix and suffix of t of length l must be that same string. Then we can assign both as prefix and suffix? But wait, the problem says: the number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. And there are n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes. \n\n        However, note: the set of prefixes and suffixes are defined independently. But the condition for the full string t: \n            The prefix of length l is t[0:l] and the suffix of length l is t[n-l:n]. \n\n        If t[0:l] == t[n-l:n] and the two given strings are the same, then we have one string that is both a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the given strings, particularly focusing on the two strings of length `n-1`, to deduce the structure of the unknown string. Once the structure is determined, we can verify the assignments for all other strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem provides `2n-2` strings, each of lengths from 1 to `n-1`, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. These strings are the proper prefixes and suffixes of an unknown string of length `n`. The task is to label each string as either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) such that there are exactly `n-1` prefixes and `n-1` suffixes, and the labels are consistent with at least one possible string of length `n`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The two strings of length `n-1` must be the longest proper prefix and suffix of the unknown string. The correct assignment between these two strings can be determined by checking if one string (excluding its first character) matches the other string (excluding its last character). This ensures that the combined string formed by the first character of the prefix and the entire suffix (or vice versa) results in a valid string of length `n`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Group Strings by Length**: Organize the input strings into groups based on their lengths.\n   - **Identify Longest Strings**: Extract the two strings of length `n-1` and check which one can be the prefix and which can be the suffix by verifying the overlap condition.\n   - **Construct the Unknown String**: Once the two longest strings are correctly assigned, construct the full string by combining the first character of the prefix with the entire suffix (or vice versa).\n   - **Label Remaining Strings**: For each remaining string, check if it matches any prefix or suffix of the constructed string and label it accordingly.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each string once during grouping and once during verification, resulting in a linear time complexity relative to the number of strings, which is `O(2n-2)`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    strings = []\n    for i in range(1, 2*n - 1 + 1):\n        strings.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    groups = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        if l not in groups:\n            groups[l] = []\n        groups[l].append(s)\n    \n    L = n - 1\n    if L in groups:\n        lst_L = groups[L]\n        if len(lst_L) != 2:\n            pass\n        else:\n            X, Y = lst_L\n            cond1 = (X[1:] == Y[:-1])\n            cond2 = (Y[1:] == X[:-1])\n            if cond1:\n                prefix_str = X\n                suffix_str = Y\n                base_char = prefix_str[0]\n                full_string = base_char + suffix_str\n            elif cond2:\n                prefix_str = Y\n                suffix_str = X\n                base_char = prefix_str[0]\n                full_string = base_char + suffix_str\n            else:\n                base_char = ''\n                full_string = ''\n                for i in range(len(X)):\n                    base_char += X[i]\n                for j in range(len(Y)):\n                    full_string += Y[j]\n                base_char = base_char + full_string\n                full_string = base_char\n        del groups[L]\n    else:\n        base_char = ''\n        full_string = ''\n        for s in strings:\n            base_char += s\n        full_string = base_char\n\n    result = []\n    for length in range(1, n):\n        lst = groups.get(length, [])\n        for s in lst:\n            if len(s) == length:\n                if s == full_string[:length]:\n                    result.append('P')\n                elif s == full_string[len(full_string)-length:]:\n                    result.append('S')\n                else:\n                    result.append('P' if 'P' in ['P', 'S'] else 'S')\n    output_string = ''.join(result)\n    print(output_string)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line is the integer `n` (length of the unknown string), followed by `2n-2` strings.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where keys are lengths and values are lists of strings of that length.\n3. **Handling Longest Strings**: The two strings of length `n-1` are extracted.
