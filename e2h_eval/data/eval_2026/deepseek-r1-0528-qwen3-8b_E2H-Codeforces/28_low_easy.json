String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given three integers: n (number of zeros required), m (number of ones required), and g (the final character we must have at the end).\n\n However, note that the string is built through modifications. The modification operation replaces the last two characters with one:\n   - If the two are \"00\", then the new character is '1'\n   - Otherwise (i.e., if there's at least one '1' in the two), the new character is '0'\n\n But note: the entire string must have exactly n zeros and m ones.\n\n Also, we can perform any number (possibly zero) of modifications. Importantly, the modifications can be performed from the end backwards? Actually, note:\n\n The process described is: we start with a string (which we don't know initially) and then we can repeatedly modify the last two characters until we get a string of length 1 or something? But wait, the problem says: we can obtain the string s by some (possibly zero) modifications. \n\n However, note the example: \n   Starting with \"01010\" (length 5): \n      Step1: replace last two \"0\" and \"0\" -> '1', so becomes \"0101\" (but wait, the example says: \"01010\" becomes \"0100\", then to \"011\".)\n\n Actually, let me re-read: \n   Example: \n     Modification 1: \"01010\" -> take the last two '0' and '0', so replace by '1'. Then the string becomes \"0101\" + \"1\" is not appended, but replacing the last two so the string becomes \"010\" (without the last two, i.e., remove last two and add the new one) -> so \"01010\" becomes \"010\" (if we remove the last two zeros and put a one, then the string is \"01\" (the first three characters without the last two?) Actually, the example says: \"01010\" becomes \"0100\", which is removing the last two and putting one? Let me check:\n\n Operation: \n   Original: \"01010\"\n   We take the last two: \"10\" (if we consider the last two as the two rightmost). But wait, the example says: \n        \"one modification transforms string '01010' into '0100'\"\n\n   So they are replacing the last two, so from \"01010\", remove the last two (which are \"10\") and then what? The rule: \n        if the two are \"00\" -> output '1', otherwise output '0'. \n        Here the two are \"10\": which is not \"00\", so output '0'. Then the string becomes \"010\" + \"0\" = \"0100\".\n\n   Then two modifications: from \"0100\", take the last two \"00\", replace by '1', so becomes \"01\" + \"1\" = \"011\".\n\n So the operation is: \n        s = s[0:-2] + (replacement of s[-2] and s[-1])\n\n Now, the problem: we are to count the number of beautiful strings (with n zeros and m ones) such that after performing some (any number) of these operations, the resulting string (of length 1 or more? Actually, the process stops when the string has length 1? But note: the operation requires at least two characters. So the process can continue until the string has length 1.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\" This means that we can reduce the string until we get a string of length 1 (if we keep going until we can't) and then the last character must be g? Or does the condition on g refer to the original string? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \n        String s is beautiful if ... (has n zeros and m ones) AND we can obtain the character g from string s (via some operations).\n\n But note: the example input: \n        \"1 1 0\" -> beautiful strings are \"01\", \"10\". \n\n How does that relate to g? The problem says: \"obtain character g from string s\". \n\n Let me read again: \n        \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\"\n\n This means that if we apply the operations (as many as we want) to the string s, we can eventually get a string (maybe of length 1) and that last character must be g.\n\n However, note: the example:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that meet specific criteria. A beautiful string consists of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones. Additionally, after performing any number of modifications (replacing the last two characters with one based on certain rules), the resulting string must end with the character `g`. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the process of modifying the string (replacing the last two characters) can be reversed. Instead of starting from the original string and reducing it to a single character, we can think about building the string from a single character through reverse operations. The reverse operation involves splitting a character into two characters such that the original modification could have produced the single character from those two.\n\n2. **Insight**: The reverse operations depend on the target character `g`:\n   - If the target character is '0', the original two characters could be either \"00\", \"01\", or \"10\". \n   - If the target character is '1', the original two characters must be \"00\".\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to build strings of length up to `n + m` (since each modification reduces the string length by 1, starting from a string of length `n + m` down to 1). The DP state `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of ways to form a string with `i` zeros and `j` ones that ends with character `k` (0 or 1).\n\n4. **Base Case**: Strings of length 1 are directly considered. For example, if `g` is '0', then strings \"0\" and \"1\" (if applicable) are valid base cases.\n\n5. **Transition**: For each state, transitions are derived from the reverse operations. For instance, to form a string ending with '0', the previous state could have been formed by appending \"00\", \"01\", or \"10\" (depending on `g`).\n\n6. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo 1000000007.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    g = int(data[2])\n    \n    total_length = n + m\n    dp = [[[0]*2 for _ in range(m+1)] for __ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    if g == 0:\n        if n >= 1:\n            dp[1][0][0] = 1\n        if m >= 1:\n            dp[0][1][0] = 1\n    else:\n        if n >= 2:\n            dp[2][0][1] = 1\n        if m >= 2:\n            dp[0][2][1] = 1\n    \n    for length in range(3, total_length+1):\n        for i in range(n+1):\n            j = length - i\n            if j > m:\n                continue\n            ways0 = 0\n            ways1 = 0\n            \n            if g == 0:\n                ways0 = (dp[i][j-1][0] + dp[i-1][j][0] + dp[i-1][j-1][0]) % MOD\n                ways1 = dp[i-1][j][1]\n            else:\n                ways0 = dp[i-2][j][0]\n                ways1 = (dp[i-1][j-1][1] + dp[i][j-2][1]) % MOD\n            \n            dp[i][j][0] = ways0\n            dp[i][j][1] = ways1\n    \n    ans = 0\n    for i in range(n+1):\n        j = total_length - i\n        if j <= m:\n            if g == 0:\n                ans = (ans + dp[i][j][0]) % MOD\n            else:\n                ans = (ans + dp[i][j][1]) % MOD\n    \n    print(ans % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads input values `n`, `m`, and `g`. It initializes a 3D DP array to store the number of ways to form strings with `i` zeros and `j` ones ending with `k` (0 or 1).\n\n2. **Base Cases**: Depending on `g`, it sets up initial states for strings of length 1 or 2. For example, if `g` is 0, strings of length 1 (\"0\") and strings of length 1 (\"1\") are considered if possible.\n\n3. **DP Transitions**: For each possible string length from 3 to `n + m`, the code calculates the number of ways to form strings ending with '0' or '1' by considering valid reverse operations. \n\n4. **Result Calculation**: After filling the DP table, the result is computed by summing all valid configurations that end with `g` and have exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones.\n\n5. **Output**: The result is printed modulo 1000000007.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the beautiful strings by leveraging dynamic programming and reverse operations, ensuring correctness while handling large numbers through modulo arithmetic.",
