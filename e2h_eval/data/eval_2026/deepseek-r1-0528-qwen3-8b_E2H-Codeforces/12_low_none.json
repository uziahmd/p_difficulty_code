The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the ringroad is circular and we can only move clockwise, note that moving from house x to house y:\n   If x <= y: then the distance is (y - x) mod n? Actually, because it's circular and clockwise, but note that we can't go counterclockwise.\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So from house 1, moving to house 2,3,...,n, then back to 1.\n\n But observe: the houses are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. The movement is clockwise. Therefore, if we are at house x and want to go to house y:\n   There are two ways? Actually no, because the road is one-way. But wait, the ringroad is circular and one-way, so after house n comes house 1.\n\n However, note that the problem does not say we can wrap arbitrarily; we are constrained by the one-way direction.\n\n Let me clarify: \n   From house i, we can only move to house i+1, unless i is n then next is 1.\n\n So the distance from house i to house j (if we consider the circular clockwise path) is:\n   If j >= i: then (j - i) steps.\n   If j < i: then we have to go from i to n, then from n to 1, and then from 1 to j. That is (n - i + j) steps.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the ringroad as a linear array from 1 to n, and then we can use modulo arithmetic.\n\n However, note: the problem states that initially Xenia is at house 1, and she must complete tasks in the given order.\n\n Important: She must complete tasks in increasing index order. But the tasks are given in the order of the thing to do. So the first task is a1, the second a2, etc.\n\n But note: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" means that when doing the i-th task, she must have already done all tasks with indices < i.\n\n So we process the tasks in the given order.\n\n However, we can plan the route optimally: since we can only move clockwise, we can break the journey into segments between consecutive tasks.\n\n Steps:\n   Start at house 1.\n   Then for each task i (from 0 to m-1), we need to go from the previous task location (or start) to the current task location.\n\n   But note: the condition \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" doesn't require that we finish the last task and then start the next. \n   However, the problem says \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i\". \n\n   This means that the order of the tasks is fixed: we must do the first task, then the second, etc.\n\n   We can accumulate the total time by moving from the current location to the next task.\n\n   However, we don't necessarily have to return to the start. We just have to complete the tasks.\n\n   Let current = 1 (starting point)\n\n   For each task location a_i:\n        We calculate the distance from current to a_i (moving clockwise only)\n\n        How to calculate?\n            If a_i >= current: \n                distance = a_i - current\n            Else: \n                distance = n - current + a_i\n\n        Then update current to a_i, and add the distance.\n\n   But wait: let's test with the example: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 3 -> distance: 3-1 = 2. Now current=3. Total=2.\n        Second task: 2 -> since 2 < 3, so distance = 4-3 + 2 = 1+2=3. Now current=2. Total=5.\n        Third task: 3 -> since 3>2, distance=3-2=1. Total=6.\n\n        Output: 6 -> matches.\n\n   Another example: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n        Start at 1.\n        First task: 2 -> 2>=1 -> distance=1. Current=2. Total=1.\n        Second task: 3 -> 3>=2 -> distance=1. Current=3. Total=2.\n        Third task: 3 -> same location, distance=0. Total=2.\n\n        Output: 2 -> matches.\n\n   However, note: the example input format is given as two examples. The second example input is \"4 3\\n2 3 3\", which outputs 2.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The key observation here is that Xenia can only move clockwise, and the time taken to move between houses depends on their positions relative to each other on the ringroad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house number 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task, calculate the distance from the current position to the task's location:\n   - If the task location is greater than or equal to the current position, the distance is simply the difference between them.\n   - If the task location is less than the current position, the distance is computed by moving from the current position to the end of the ringroad (house `n`), then wrapping around to the start (house 1) and moving to the task location.\n3. **Accumulate Time**: Sum the distances calculated for each task to get the total time required.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the circular nature of the ringroad by breaking down each movement into segments that account for the one-way clockwise movement, ensuring the minimal path is always taken.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            distance = a - current\n        else:\n            distance = n - current + a\n        total_time += distance\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initial Position**: Xenia starts at house 1.\n3. **Processing Each Task**: For each task location:\n   - If the task location is ahead of or equal to the current position, the distance is straightforward (task location minus current position).\n   - If the task location is behind the current position, the distance is calculated by moving to the end of the ringroad and then to the task location (accounting for the circular wrap-around).\n4. **Updating Position and Time**: After each task, update the current position to the task's location and add the computed distance to the total time.\n5. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated total time is printed.\n\nThis method ensures that Xenia takes the shortest possible path between consecutive tasks, leveraging the circular nature of the ringroad and the constraint of clockwise movement. The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 tasks and houses, operating within linear time complexity.",
