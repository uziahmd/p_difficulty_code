The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are constructing a snowflake as follows:\n- Start with 1 vertex (step 0).\n- Then, we do at least one step. In each step, every vertex that has degree 1 (i.e., connected to only one other vertex) will be expanded by connecting it to k new vertices (k>1). \n\nHowever, note that after the first expansion, we have a central node with k edges, and then k leaves. Then in the next expansion, we would expand each of the k leaves? But wait: the rule says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) is connected to k new vertices.\n\nBut note: the smallest snowflake for k=4 has 1 + 4 = 5 vertices. Actually, the figure might show more steps? Let me clarify:\n\nThe process:\nStep 0: 1 vertex.\nStep 1: The initial vertex is connected to k new ones -> total vertices: 1 + k.\nThen, in the next step (at least once, so we must do step 1, but then we can do more), we take each leaf (which is connected only once) and attach k new ones. So from the initial vertex we had k leaves, and then each leaf becomes a node with k new children. Then the total number of vertices after two steps is: 1 + k + k*k.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we must do at least one expansion beyond the initial? Actually, the first expansion is mandatory. However, we can do more than one expansion.\n\nLet me read the rules again:\n  - Initially, the graph has only one vertex.\n  - Then, more vertices are added: the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). [This is the first expansion]\n  - Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nWait, the second bullet point says \"then\" (meaning after the first expansion) we do this step at least once. So the minimal snowflake is after two steps? Actually, no: the first expansion is the first step, and then we must do the second step (expanding the leaves) at least once. So minimum two expansions? \n\nBut the example says the smallest for k=4 has 5 vertices. That matches: 1 + 4 = 5, which is after the first expansion. However, the problem states: \"This step should be done at least once.\" — meaning the second expansion (the one that expands the leaves) must be done at least once? \n\nWait, the problem says: \n  \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n  Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the first expansion is the first part, and the second expansion (on the leaves) is the step that must be done at least once. Therefore, the minimal snowflake (with two expansions) has 1 + k + k*k vertices.\n\nBut wait, the example output says:\n  Input: 6 -> Output: NO\n  Input: 13 -> Output: YES\n\nLet me check with k=2 (minimal k):\n  Two expansions: 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7 -> so 7 is yes (if 7<=10^18, but n can be up to 10^18)\n\nBut 6: \n  We cannot have two expansions because 1 + k + k*k = 1+k+k^2. For k=2: 1+2+4=7; k=3: 1+3+9=13; k=4: 1+4+16=21; k=5: 1+5+25=31, etc.\n\nBut wait, what if we do more than two expansions? \n\nActually, the process is defined as:\n\nStep 0: 1 node.\nStep 1: add k nodes -> total = 1 + k\nStep 2: expand the k leaves (each gets k children) -> total = 1 + k + k*k\nStep 3: now the leaves from step 2 (each of the k*k nodes) must be expanded? But wait: the rule says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" — after step 2, the leaves from step 2 (the k*k nodes) are the only ones with degree 1. Then we do step 3: each of these k*k nodes is connected to k new ones -> total = 1 + k + k*k + k*k*k\n\nBut note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning that we must do at least one expansion (step 2) after the first expansion (step 1). However, we can do more than one step (step 2, step 3, ...) arbitrarily many times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of vertices after m expansions (m>=1, because step 1 is mandatory, and then we do at least one more expansion, i.e., m>=2) is:\n\n  n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\nBut note: the first expansion (step 1) gives 1+k, then step 2 gives 1+k+k^2, then step 3 gives 1+k+k^2+k^3, etc.\n\nHowever, wait: the problem says \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" — that is step 1, and then \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\" — that is step 2, and then we can do step 3, etc.\n\nBut note: the initial expansion (step 1) is mandatory, and then the second expansion (step 2) is mandatory (at least once). So the minimal expansion count is 2 (steps 1 and 2). However, the problem does not require that we stop at step 2. We can do more.\n\nSo the total number of vertices is the sum of a geometric series:\n\n  n = 1 + k * (1 - k^m) / (1 - k)   [but actually, we can write]\n\nActually, the geometric series formula for base k and m+1 terms (from exponent 0 to m) is:\n\n  n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\nBut note: our expansion steps: \n  Step 0: 1 = (k^1 - 1)/(k-1) [if we consider m=0: then n=1] but wait, we have at least two expansions (m>=2). However, note that the problem says the first expansion (step 1) is the one that adds k nodes, and then we must do the second expansion (step 2) at least once. So we must have at least two layers (so m=2, meaning two expansions after the initial? Actually, the initial node is step 0, then step 1 (first expansion) and step 2 (second expansion) — so m=2.\n\nBut the problem does not fix the number of expansions. It can be any m>=2 (because we do at least two expansions: step1 and step2).\n\nAlternatively, we can think: the process is defined by a fixed branching factor k (k>1) and a depth d (number of expansions, d>=2). Then:\n\n  n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: d is the number of expansions (so the exponents go from 0 to d, which is d+1 terms). Alternatively, we can also consider that the root is at level 0, then level 1: k nodes, level 2: k^2 nodes, ... level d: k^d nodes.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the first expansion (step 1) is the one that connects the root to k nodes. Then the second expansion (step 2) is when the k leaves (each at level 1) are expanded. Then the third expansion (step 3) expands the leaves at level 2, and so on. So the depth d is the maximum level (from root being level 0 to leaves at level d). Then the total number of nodes is:\n\n  n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: the problem requires at least two expansions (so d>=2). However, wait: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the second expansion (the one that expands the leaves) must be done at least once. The first expansion is already done, so we must have at least two expansions (d>=2). But note: the first expansion is mandatory and the second expansion is mandatory (at least once). So d>=2.\n\nHowever, note: the problem does not require that the entire snowflake is built in exactly two steps. It can be built in more. So we have:\n\n  n = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1)   for some integer k>1 and integer d>=2.\n\nBut note: the problem asks: does there exist an integer k>1 and an integer d>=2 such that n = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1)?\n\nBut note: the example input 6: \n  Is there k>1 and d>=2 such that (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1)=6?\n  d>=2, so d+1>=3.\n\n  For d+1=3: (k^3-1)/(k-1)=k^2+k+1=6 -> k^2+k-5=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(21))/2 -> not integer.\n  For d+1=4: (k^4-1)/(k-1)=k^3+k^2+k+1=6 -> k^3+k^2+k-5=0 -> k=1: 1+1+1-5=-2; k=2: 8+4+2-5=9 -> too big. No integer solution.\n\nBut note: we can also consider that the entire snowflake might be built with different numbers of expansions per branch? Actually, the problem says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\" — so it's uniform: every leaf (degree 1) is expanded by k children. And we do this until we stop. However, the process is defined as: we do the expansion at least once (on the leaves from the first expansion). Then we can stop.\n\nBut note: the expansion is applied simultaneously to all leaves? Or sequentially? Actually, the description doesn't specify order, but the symmetry suggests that we build the same number of children for each leaf. However, we can stop at any expansion level. So the entire snowflake is built by having a fixed branching factor k and a fixed depth d (>=2). \n\nBut wait, is that the case? Actually, the process: \n  Step 0: root (1 node)\n  Step 1: root has k children (total 1+k)\n  Step 2: each of the k children gets k children (total 1+k+k^2)\n  Step 3: each of the k^2 children from step 2 gets k children (total 1+k+k^2+k^3)\n\nBut note: after step 2, the root has k children and k^2 grandchildren. The root has degree k, so it is not expanded again. The leaves are only the grandchildren (and later the great-grandchildren, etc.). So the entire structure is a complete k-ary tree of depth d (with d being the number of expansions, so the root is at depth 0, then depth 1, ... up to depth d). And the total number of nodes is the sum of the nodes at each level: 1 (root) + k (level1) + k^2 (level2) + ... + k^d.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\" — meaning we must have at least two levels (root and then at least one expansion). So d>=2? Actually, the minimal is d=1 (only the root and one expansion) but wait: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\" — which is the expansion of the leaves from the first expansion. So if we do only one expansion (step 1) then we don't do the second step (which is mandatory). Therefore, we must have at least two expansions (so d>=2). \n\nBut wait: the example says the smallest snowflake for k=4 is 5 vertices. With k=4 and d=1: 1 + 4 = 5. But according to our reasoning, we must do the second expansion at least once, so we must have at least 1+4+16=21? \n\nThis is conflicting. Let me reread the problem statement:\n\n\"He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:\n  Initially, the graph has only one vertex.\n  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\n  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the second rule is the first expansion (mandatory). The third rule is the second expansion (must be done at least once). Therefore, the minimal snowflake must have at least two expansions: the first expansion (adding k nodes) and then the second expansion (adding k^2 nodes). \n\nBut then why does the example say the smallest for k=4 is 5? 5 is 1+4, which is one expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rule: the second rule is the first expansion, and the third rule is the condition that must be done at least once. But note: the second expansion is done on the leaves that are created by the first expansion. However, the problem does not explicitly say that we must do the second expansion after the first, but the rule says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the entire process (including the first expansion and then the second) must occur at least once. \n\nBut then the minimal snowflake would have 1+k+k^2 nodes. For k=4, that would be 1+4+16=21, not 5.\n\nThere is a contradiction. Let me look at the example output:\n\nInput: \n  1 -> NO\n  2 -> NO\n  3 -> NO\n  6 -> NO\n  13 -> YES\n  15 -> YES\n  255 -> YES\n  10101 -> YES\n  1000000000000000000 -> NO\n\nWait, 13 is YES. 13 = 1 + k + k^2? \n  k=3: 1+3+9=13 -> so that works.\n\nBut then 5 is not in the example input. The example input includes 6 (NO) and 13 (YES). \n\nBut wait, the example input also includes 15. 15: \n  d=2: 1+k+k^2=15 -> k^2+k-14=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(57))/2 -> not integer.\n  d=3: 1+k+k^2+k^3=15 -> k^3+k^2+k-14=0. \n      k=2: 8+4+2-14=0 -> yes. So 15 = (2^4-1)/(2-1) = 15. So d=3 (three expansions? Actually, the depth is 3: root, then two expansions (step1 and step2) and then step3? But wait, the formula: (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1) for d=3: (2^4-1)/(2-1)=15. So that is valid.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the second expansion must be done at least once. That means we must have at least two expansions (so d>=2). But note: the first expansion is the one that adds k, then the second expansion adds k^2, and then the third expansion adds k^3. So the minimal is two expansions (d=2) and then we can do more.\n\nBut then why is 5 (which is 1+4) not allowed? Because 5 is just one expansion (d=1) and the problem requires at least two expansions (d>=2). \n\nWait, the problem says: \n  \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n  Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nThis implies that the second expansion (the one that adds the k^2) must occur. So 5 is not a valid snowflake.\n\nBut then why is 13 (which is 1+3+9) valid? Because it has two expansions (step1: root->3 nodes, step2: each of the 3 nodes gets 3 children -> 9 more nodes, total 13).\n\nHowever, the example input 6: \n  We need to find integers k>1 and d>=2 such that (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1)=6.\n\nWe tried d=2: (k^3-1)/(k-1)=k^2+k+1=6 -> k^2+k-5=0 -> no integer solution.\nd=3: (k^4-1)/(k-1)=k^3+k^2+k+1=6 -> no integer solution (k=1 is not allowed, k=2: 8+4+2+1=15>6, k=1 not allowed, k=0 not allowed). \n\nSo 6 is not a valid snowflake.\n\nNow, note that the example input 15 is valid because 15 = (2^4-1)/(2-1)=15, which corresponds to d=3 (three expansions: step1, step2, step3). \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\" — meaning we must do the second expansion (which is step2) at least once. Then we can do more. So d>=2 (because the first expansion is step1 and then we must do step2, which is the second expansion). However, the formula we used for d=3 (which gives 15) uses three expansions (steps1, step2, step3). But note: the expansion step is defined as: after the first expansion (step1) we do the second expansion (step2) at least once. Then we can do step3, step4, etc.\n\nBut note: the problem does not say we must stop after the second expansion. We can do more. So the condition is: there exists an integer k>1 and an integer d>=2 (where d is the total number of expansions, meaning the depth of the tree is d) such that n = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\nBut note: the example 15: d=3 (because we have three expansions: step1, step2, step3) and k=2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the first expansion is step1 and then we must do step2 at least once. So the minimal d is 2 (two expansions: step1 and step2). Then we can have d=3,4,... \n\nSo the condition is: there exists an integer k>1 and an integer d>=2 such that n = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\nBut note: we can also consider that the entire snowflake is built with a fixed k and a fixed d (depth). \n\nHowever, note: the problem does not require that the entire snowflake is built with the same k throughout? Actually, k is fixed by the problem: the same k is used for every expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules\", and the rules use k (a fixed integer) for each expansion.\n\nTherefore, we have to check: for a given n, does there exist integers k>1 and d>=2 such that:\n\n  n = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: n can be as large as 10^18, and t up to 10000.\n\nHow to solve?\n\nWe note that d>=2, so the exponent d+1>=3. Also, k>=2.\n\nWe can try to fix d (the exponent base) and then solve for k.\n\nAlternatively, note that the formula is:\n\n  n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d.\n\nBut note: we can also consider that the snowflake might be built with multiple branches that stop earlier? Actually, the problem says: every leaf (vertex with degree 1) is expanded by k new nodes. So we must expand every leaf until we stop. Therefore, the entire snowflake is a complete k-ary tree of depth d.\n\nBut wait: the example of 15: 1+2+4+8? Actually, no: 1+2+4+8=15, but that is a binary tree (k=2) with four levels (depth 3). However, the structure is a complete binary tree? Yes, and the total nodes in a complete binary tree of depth 3 is 15.\n\nBut note: the definition says: \n  Initially, the graph has one vertex.\n  Then, the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k=2) -> so two edges from the root, then each leaf (the two children) is expanded by k=2, so each becomes two children, and then the leaves from the second expansion are expanded again (if we did three expansions) but wait, the problem says we do the expansion step (on leaves) at least once. \n\nActually, the problem does not say we do the expansion until a certain depth, but we do at least one expansion (the second one) and we can do more. \n\nBut note: the example input 1 is NO (n=1). The minimal n is for k=2, d=2: 1+2+4=7. Then k=2, d=3: 15, k=2,d=4: 31, etc. But wait, what about k=3, d=2: 1+3+9=13.\n\nBut note: there is another possibility: maybe we don't have to expand every leaf to the same depth? The problem says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\" — meaning we do it for every leaf. So we must expand every leaf. Therefore, the entire tree is complete.\n\nBut wait, the problem does not say we do the expansion until a fixed depth. It says we do the expansion (on leaves) at least once. Then we can stop. But note: the expansion is defined as: we do the expansion on every leaf. So if we stop after two expansions, then we have a complete k-ary tree of depth 2 (root, then level1, level2). If we stop after three expansions, then we have depth 3, etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is always the sum of a geometric series (complete k-ary tree of depth d, with d>=2).\n\nNow, the problem: given n (up to 10^18), check if there exists integers k>1 and d>=2 such that:\n\n  n = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: we can also consider that the snowflake might be built with a fixed k and variable d. \n\nHowever, note that d is at least 2, so the minimal n is 1+2+4=7 (for k=2, d=2) and 1+3+9=13 (for k=3, d=2) and 1+4+16=21 (for k=4, d=2). \n\nBut wait, what about k=2 and d=1? That would be 1+2=3, but d=1 is not allowed (because we must do at least two expansions). \n\nNow, how to check for a given n (which can be as large as 10^18) without iterating over all k and d?\n\nNote: the equation is:\n\n  n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d,   d>=2, k>=2.\n\nWe can fix d (the exponent) and then solve for k. Note that d+1 is at most about 60 because 2^60 is around 1e18, so d+1 can be up to about 60 (since k>=2). So we can iterate d from 2 to about 60 (or 61) and then for each d, we want to know: is there an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n  n = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nBut note: the left-hand side is a polynomial in k of degree d. We can use binary search for k for a fixed d? Or we can note that k must be the d-th root of something.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n  n*(k-1) = k^(d+1) - 1\n\nBut note: the equation is:\n\n  k^(d+1) - n*(k-1) - 1 = 0\n\nBut solving for k is difficult. However, note that for fixed d, the function f(k) = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing for k>=2. So we can use binary search for k for fixed d.\n\nBut note: n can be up to 10^18, and d is small (at most 60). So we can do:\n\n  for d from 2 to 60 (inclusive) [since 2^60 is about 1e18, so d+1=61, then k_min=2, k_max might be around 10^18^(1/61) which is around 10^(18/61) ~ 10^0.3 ~ about 2, but wait: we are solving for k in the equation n = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1). \n\nActually, we can set k_min=2 and k_max = floor(pow(n, 1/(d+1))) + 1, but wait: the equation is:\n\n  (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1) <= (k^(d+1))/(k-1) <= k^d (if k>=2) and note that k^(d+1) is about n*(k-1) (roughly). \n\nBut we can use binary search for k for fixed d.\n\nHowever, note: the equation for fixed d and k is:\n\n  n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d\n\nWe can compute the sum for a given k and d. But k might be large? Actually, for fixed d (say d=2), then we have:\n\n  n = 1 + k + k^2\n\nWe can solve for k: k^2 + k + (1-n)=0. Then k = (-1+sqrt(1+4*(n-1)))/2. Then check if that k is integer and >=2.\n\nSimilarly, for d=3:\n\n  n = 1+k+k^2+k^3\n\nWe can use binary search for k (from 2 to about pow(n,1/4) for d=3) but note that n can be up to 10^18, and d is small (from 2 to about 60). \n\nBut note: the maximal d we need to consider is the maximum exponent such that 2^(d+1) <= n*(k-1) + 1, but k>=2, so the minimal value for the sum is 1+2+4=7 (for d=2). The maximal d is when k=2: then the sum is (2^(d+1)-1). So d+1 must be <= log2(n*2) (because n>= (2^(d+1)-1)/(2-1) = 2^(d+1)-1). \n\nAlternatively, we can iterate d from 2 to about floor(log2(n))+1, but since n can be 1, but n>=1, and we skip n<7? Actually, we are given test cases from 1 to 10^18.\n\nBut note: we can also consider that k might be large and d small. For example, if d=2, then n=1+k+k^2. Then k is about sqrt(n). Similarly, for d=3, k is about n^(1/3). \n\nBut note: d is the depth (number of expansions). The equation is:\n\n  n = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nWe can fix d from 2 to about 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18, so d+1=60, then k would be at least 2, so the minimal n for d=60 and k=2 is (2^61-1) which is about 2e18, which is greater than 10^18, so we only need d from 2 to 59 (for k=2, the minimal n is (2^(d+1)-1). \n\nBut note: k can be larger than 2. For example, if k is large, then d can be 2: n=1+k+k^2. Then k is about sqrt(n). Since n can be 10^18, then k is about 1e9, which is acceptable for a binary search? Actually, we cannot iterate k from 2 to 1e9 for each test case (because t up to 10000) and for each d from 2 to 60. \n\nBut wait, we are iterating d from 2 to 60 (about 60 values) and for each d we do a binary search for k. The total operations would be 60 * (log(max_k)) per test case. \n\nBut what is the range for k for a fixed d? \n\nFor fixed d, we have:\n\n  n = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\nWe can set k_min=2, and k_max = min(floor(pow(n, 1/(d+1))) + 10, n) ? But note: the equation is not exactly k^(d+1) = n*(k-1)+1, but the left side is the geometric series. However, we can use:\n\n  k^(d+1) <= n*(k-1)+1\n\nBut we can set k_max = 2: then the minimal n is 7. Then for n=10^18, d=2: k_max ~ sqrt(10^18) = 1e9. Then for d=3: k_max ~ (10^18)^(1/4) = 1e4.5, so about 3e4. For d=4: k_max ~ (10^18)^(1/5) = 10^(18/5)=10^3.6 ~ 4000.\n\nBut if we do a binary search for k from 2 to k_max (which for d=2 is 1e9) then the binary search will take about log2(1e9) ~ 30 iterations per d. Then for each test case, we do 60 * 30 = 1800 iterations, and t up to 10000 -> 10000 * 1800 = 18e6, which is acceptable in Python? \n\nBut wait: we have to compute for each d and each candidate k the value (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1). But k^(d+1) for k=1e9 and d=2: that is (1e9)^3 = 1e27, which is too big for integers in terms of computation time? But note: n is up to 10^18, and for d=2, we have:\n\n  n = 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut if k is 1e9, then k^2 is 1e18, and k^3 is 1e27 which is beyond 10^18. But wait, we are only considering k such that (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1) <= n (which is 10^18). \n\nBut for d=2, we have:\n\n  n = 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWe can solve for k: k^2 + k + 1 - n = 0. Then k = (-1+sqrt(1+4*(n-1)))/2. \n\nBut note: we are iterating d from 2 to 60. For d=2, we can solve without binary search by computing the quadratic equation. Similarly, for d=3, we have a cubic equation. But we can use binary search for d>=4? Actually, for d=2 and d=3 we can use closed forms, but for d>=4 we use binary search.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the same method for all d: use binary search for k from 2 to k_max (which is set as the integer part of the (d+1)-th root of n*(k-1)+1, but we don't know k). \n\nBut note: we can set k_max for fixed d:\n\n  We have: n = (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1) < (k^(d+1))/(k-1) <= k^d * k/(k-1) \n\nBut we can set k_max = floor(pow(n, 1/d)) + 10   [because (k^(d+1))/(k-1) is roughly k^d, so k is roughly the d-th root of n]. Actually, for d=2, we have k_max = floor(sqrt(n)) + 10, but that's too high because n=10^18 gives k_max ~ 1e9, which is acceptable for binary search? But 1e9 is the upper bound, and we do about 30 iterations per d. For d=2, we do 30 * 60 = 1800 per test case, and then 10000 test cases would be 18000000 iterations, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline. However, note that for d=2, the equation is quadratic and we can avoid binary search by solving the quadratic equation. Similarly, for d=3, we can use the cubic equation? Actually, we can use binary search for all d.\n\nBut wait, we can also use the fact that k must be an integer and use a while loop for d=2 and d=3 separately? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a unified approach:\n\n  For a fixed d (>=2), we want to know if there exists an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n      (k^(d+1)-1)/(k-1) == n\n\nBut note: we are working with integers and n up to 10^18, and d from 2 to 60. The exponent d+1 can be up to 61, and k can be as large as about n^(1/(d+1)) (which for d=2 is about 1e9, which is acceptable for binary search? The binary search for k from 2 to 1e9 takes about 30 iterations. Then for each iteration, we compute k^(d+1). For d=2, d+1=3, so k^3. For k=1e9, k^3 is 1e27, which is a very big number, but we can use logarithms or compare without computing the full power? \n\nBut note: we are only doing 60 * 30 * (number of test cases) = 1800 * 10000 = 18e6 iterations, and each iteration computes k^(d+1) for k up to 1e9 and d+1 up to 61. \n\nBut 1e9 raised to 61 is astronomical. We cannot compute that directly.\n\nWe need a better way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can iterate d from 2 to max_d (max_d = floor(log2(n)) + 1, but n can be 1, so we need to handle n<7 separately). But note: we can break early: if d+1 is such that 2^(d+1) > n*(2-1)+1 (i.e., n) then we can break because for k=2 the sum is already bigger than n. But wait,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a single vertex (the root). Each subsequent layer expands every leaf node (nodes with only one connection) by adding \\( k \\) new nodes, where \\( k > 1 \\). This expansion must be performed at least once after the initial expansion from the root.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the total number of vertices in the snowflake graph after \\( d \\) expansions (where \\( d \\geq 2 \\)) forms a geometric series. Specifically, the total vertices \\( n \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^d = \\frac{k^{d+1} - 1}{k - 1}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( k \\) is the branching factor (an integer greater than 1), and \\( d \\) is the depth of expansion (an integer at least 2).\n\n2. **Insight**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) and an integer \\( d \\geq 2 \\) such that the above equation holds. Since \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^{18} \\), a brute-force approach is infeasible. Instead, we iterate over possible values of \\( d \\) (from 2 up to a maximum depth where \\( k = 2 \\) would exceed \\( n \\)), and for each \\( d \\), we solve for \\( k \\) using binary search.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each test case:\n   - If \\( n < 7 \\), immediately return \"NO\" because the smallest valid snowflake (with \\( k = 2 \\) and \\( d = 2 \\)) has 7 vertices.\n   - For \\( n \\geq 7 \\), iterate \\( d \\) from 2 to a maximum depth (e.g., 60, since \\( 2^{60} \\) is around \\( 10^{18} \\)).\n   - For each \\( d \\), use binary search to find an integer \\( k \\) such that the geometric series sum equals \\( n \\). The binary search range for \\( k \\) is from 2 to \\( \\lfloor \\text{nth root}(n, d+1) \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks each test case by iterating over possible depths \\( d \\) (up to 60) and performing a binary search for \\( k \\) (logarithmic in the value of \\( k \\)). Given the constraints, this approach handles up to \\( 10^4 \\) test cases efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        \n        if n < 7:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        max_d = 60\n        \n        for d in range(2, max_d + 1):\n            low_k = 2\n            high_k = n\n            candidate_k = None\n            \n            while low_k <= high_k:\n                mid_k = (low_k + high_k) // 2\n                total_nodes = 0\n                power = 1\n                valid = True\n                for i in range(d + 1):\n                    if power > n:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    total_nodes += power\n                    if i < d:\n                        power *= mid_k\n                        if power > n and mid_k > 1:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                if not valid or total_nodes > n:\n                    high_k = mid_k - 1\n                else:\n                    if total_nodes == n:\n                        found = True\n                        candidate_k = mid_k\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        low_k = mid_k + 1\n                        \n            if found:\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Handling Small \\( n \\)**: For \\( n < 7 \\), the answer is immediately \"NO\" since no valid snowflake can be formed.\n3. **Iterating Over Depths**: For each test case, the algorithm checks depths from 2 to 60.
