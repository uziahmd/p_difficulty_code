    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. The goal is to find the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by changing at most one element.\n\n Observation:\n 1. Without any change, we can have a contiguous strictly increasing segment. But we are allowed to fix one broken part.\n\n Steps:\n - We can precompute two arrays:\n   left[i]: the length of the strictly increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (with a[i] being included)\n   right[j]: the length of the strictly increasing subsegment starting exactly at j (with a[j] being included)\n\n How to compute left:\n   left[0] = 1\n   for i from 1 to n-1:\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            left[i] = 1\n\n Similarly, right:\n   right[n-1] = 1\n   for i from n-2 down to 0:\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right[i] = 1\n\n Then, we consider two types of segments:\n\n Type 1: The entire segment without any change (if it is already strictly increasing) then we can use the whole segment if we don't need a change? But note: we are allowed to change one number even if the segment is already increasing. However, we are looking for the longest. So we must consider that maybe a longer segment can be fixed by one change.\n\n Actually, we can break the problem into:\n\n Option 1: A segment that doesn't require any change (already strictly increasing). Then we can consider the whole segment as candidate.\n\n Option 2: A segment that requires one change. This change can fix an inversion. The inversion must be such that by changing one element, the entire segment becomes strictly increasing.\n\n There are two main cases for the segment where we are allowed to change one element:\n\n Case A: The segment has no inversion (so we can take the entire segment without change). But note: we are allowed to change one element even if it's not needed. However, we want the longest. We can also consider segments that are broken but can be fixed by one change.\n\n But note: we might have a segment that is broken at two places. Then one change won't fix two breaks. So we are only allowed to fix one break.\n\n How to consider the broken segments?\n\n Let's say we have a segment from L to R (inclusive). We are allowed to change one element. Then the segment must be almost strictly increasing. Specifically, there should be at most one index i in [L+1, R] such that a[i] <= a[i-1].\n\n However, note that sometimes we can fix the segment by changing an element that is not necessarily the one that breaks the condition. For example, if we have [1, 3, 2, 4], we can fix the 2 to 3 and get [1,3,3,4] which is not strictly increasing. But wait, we need strictly increasing. So we must ensure strict increase.\n\n Actually, the condition for the entire segment after changing one element must be strictly increasing. \n\n How to approach?\n\n We can consider:\n\n Candidate 1: Entire array without change if it is strictly increasing.\n\n But note: we are allowed to change one even if it's not needed. So we can also consider segments that are broken but can be fixed by one change.\n\n We can think of three possibilities:\n\n 1. The segment is already strictly increasing. Then we can take the entire segment.\n\n 2. The segment has exactly one \"break\" (i.e., one place where a[i] <= a[i-1]) and we can fix that break by changing either a[i] or a[i-1] (but note: we can change only one element, so we can fix one break).\n\n However, note that sometimes we might have two breaks that are adjacent and one change can fix both? Example: [1,5,3,4] -> breaks at index1 (5 and 3) and index2 (3 and 4) is okay. But if we change 5 to 2, then [1,2,3,4] is strictly increasing. So actually, we can fix two breaks if they are consecutive and the change we make fixes both.\n\n Actually, the problem is more complex. We can use the following idea:\n\n We want to consider a segment [l, r] and check if we can fix it with one change. But iterating over all segments is O(n^2) which is too slow for n up to 10^5.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can try to extend the segment from the center of the break. Let's define:\n\n We know the left and right arrays. Then, we can consider:\n\n Consider a candidate segment that covers from i - x to i + y, and the break is at i (or around i). But we can also consider the break between i and i+1.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute left and right arrays.\n\n 2. We know that the answer must be at least the maximum value in left (which is the longest contiguous increasing segment without any change).\n\n 3. Now, consider that we are allowed to fix one break. We can try to merge two increasing segments by one change.\n\n Conditions for merging two segments [l, i] and [i+1, r] (so the break is at i and i+1):\n\n   - The two segments must be strictly increasing.\n   - The change must fix the drop between a[i] and a[i+1]. We can change either a[i] or a[i+1] to bridge the gap.\n\n   Possibilities:\n\n   a) Change a[i]: then we require that a[i] < a[i+1] (actually we can set a[i] to something between a[i-1] and a[i+1] if a[i-1] < a[i+1]). But note, we want to keep the entire segment strictly increasing.\n\n   Condition for merging when changing a[i]:\n        We require: a[i-1] < (new a[i]) and (new a[i]) < a[i+1]. Since we can choose any integer, the condition is that we can set a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if such exists). This requires that a[i-1] < a[i+1]. Then the merged segment would have length = left[i] + right[i+1] - 1 (because the element at i is counted once).\n\n   b) Change a[i+1]: then we require that a[i] < (new a[i+1]) and (new a[i+1]) > a[i+2] (if exists). But note: we are considering the entire segment from l to r, so we must check the entire segment.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider the break at position i (between i and i+1) and then:\n\n   - If the break is such that a[i] > a[i+1], then we can consider changing a[i] or a[i+1] to fix the break.\n\n   But note: we can also have breaks that are not just one inversion. However, the problem allows only one change.\n\n   Actually, we are allowed to change one element anywhere in the segment. So the entire segment must have at most one \"break\" that can be fixed by one change.\n\n   However, note: the break might be fixed by changing an element that is not the one causing the immediate inversion. For example, [1, 10, 9, 8] - here the break is at index1 (10 and 9). But we can change the 9 to 11, then we have [1,10,11,8] -> still not increasing. Or change 10 to 0: [1,0,9,8] -> not increasing.\n\n   Actually, the entire segment must be strictly increasing except for at most one adjacent inversion. But note: if there are two separate inversions, one change cannot fix both unless the two inversions are consecutive and the change bridges both.\n\n   Therefore, the segment must have at most one adjacent pair (i, i+1) such that a[i] >= a[i+1]. And if there is one such break, then we can fix it by changing either a[i] or a[i+1] provided that:\n\n   - Changing a[i]: then we require that a[i-1] < a[i+1] (so that we can set a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1]).\n   - Changing a[i+1]: then we require that a[i] < a[i+2] (if i+2 exists) and also we can set a[i+1] to a value between a[i] and a[i+2] (if i+2 exists). But note, if i+2 doesn't exist, then we only require a[i] < a[i+1] (but wait, we are going to change a[i+1] to be greater than a[i] and there's no next constraint, so we can set it arbitrarily large? Actually, the condition for the entire segment is:\n\n        ... , a[i] < (new a[i+1]), and if there is a[i+2] then (new a[i+1]) < a[i+2] must hold.\n\n   However, note: the segment we are considering is from l to r. We are breaking the segment at the change. The change must be done in the middle. So the conditions for the entire segment are:\n\n        For all indices from l to i: strictly increasing (already ensured by left array)\n        For the changed element, we need to ensure that the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n   Actually, we can break the segment into three parts:\n\n        [l, i-1] must be strictly increasing (we know from left[i-1])\n        [i+1, r] must be strictly increasing (we know from right[i+1])\n\n   Then, if we change a[i] (at position i), we need to satisfy:\n        a[i-1] < (new a[i]) and (new a[i]) < a[i+1]   (if we are merging two parts, and the entire segment includes i-1, i, i+1)\n\n   But note: the segment we are considering might start at l and end at r, and we are allowed to have the entire segment. However, we are only considering one break.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Let candidate_length = 1 (minimum segment)\n\n        Step 1: Without any break, we can have a segment of length L (from left and right arrays). The maximum without change is max_left = max(left) (but note: the entire array might be broken, then we take the maximum increasing segment).\n\n        Step 2: With one break, we can consider:\n\n            For each index i from 0 to n-2 (the break is between i and i+1):\n\n                Option A: Change a[i] to fix the break.\n\n                    Condition: \n                        - The left part [l, i] must be strictly increasing (we know the entire left part ending at i is left[i]).\n                        - The right part [i+1, r] must be strictly increasing (we know the entire right part starting at i+1 is right[i+1]).\n                        - Additionally, we must be able to set a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if i is not the first element, then we require a[i-1] < a[i+1]; if i==0, then we don't have a left neighbor, so we only require a[i] < a[i+1] and the left part is just [a0] so no problem for left).\n\n                    However, note: the left part ends at i, so the last element is a[i] and we are going to change it. Then the condition for the left side is that the previous segment (if exists) must be strictly increasing up to a[i-1]. Then we set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1] (if i+1 exists). But what if i is the last element? Then we don't have i+1, so we can set a[i] arbitrarily large? Actually, if i is the last element, then we don't have a next element, so we don't need to worry about the right side? But wait, the break is between i and i+1, so if i is the last element then there is no break? Actually, our break is defined between i and i+1, so i must be from 0 to n-2.\n\n                Similarly, Option B: Change a[i+1] to fix the break.\n\n                    Condition:\n                        - The left part [l, i] must be strictly increasing (left[i])\n                        - The right part [i+2, r] must be strictly increasing (right[i+2] if i+2 exists, but if i+2 doesn't exist then the right part is just [a[i+1]] so no condition on the right? Actually, we can set a[i+1] arbitrarily large, but we must set it greater than a[i]. However, the entire segment must be strictly increasing, so we require a[i] < (new a[i+1]). And if there is a[i+2], then we require (new a[i+1]) < a[i+2]. But note: the original condition for the break is a[i] >= a[i+1]. After change, we require a[i] < a[i+1] (but wait, we are changing a[i+1] so the condition is a[i] < (new a[i+1]) and if there is a[i+2] then (new a[i+1]) < a[i+2]. However, the original a[i+1] might be less than a[i+2] or not. But note: the right part [i+1, r] originally is strictly increasing, so a[i+1] < a[i+2] < ...? Actually, the right part array is computed as the strictly increasing sequence starting at i+1, so the condition for the right part is independent of the left. But if we change a[i+1] to a value that is less than a[i+2] (if exists) then the entire right part must still be strictly increasing. However, the right part was computed without considering the change. So we must check the entire segment from i+1 to the end? Actually, we are breaking the segment at the change. The segment we are considering is from l to r, and we are changing a[i+1] to some value. Then the condition for the entire segment is:\n\n                            ... , a[i] < (new a[i+1]) < a[i+2] (if exists)\n\n                    But note: the original right part [i+1, r] is strictly increasing, so if we change a[i+1] to a value that is less than a[i+2] (if exists) then the condition for the rest of the right part (from i+1 to r) is maintained? Not exactly: because the condition for the entire segment requires that the new a[i+1] is greater than a[i] and less than a[i+2] (if i+2 exists). But if we change a[i+1] to a value that is less than a[i+2] but greater than a[i], then the entire segment from i+1 to r is still strictly increasing? Actually, yes, because the rest of the segment (from i+2 to r) is strictly increasing and the new a[i+1] is less than a[i+2] so the entire segment from i to r is strictly increasing.\n\n                    However, if we change a[i+1] and i+2 doesn't exist, then we don't have the condition for a[i+2]. Then the condition is just a[i] < (new a[i+1]).\n\n        But wait, we are considering the entire segment from l to r. We must ensure that the entire segment is strictly increasing. We break the segment at the change, but the change might affect the boundaries.\n\n        Actually, we can consider:\n\n            For a given break at i (between i and i+1), we can form a segment from:\n\n                l = max(0, i - left[i] + 1)   ??? Not exactly.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n            Let the segment we are considering be from i-left[i]+1 to i+right[i+1]-1? Actually, we don't know the exact boundaries. We know:\n\n                The left part: the segment must end at i and be strictly increasing, so the left part goes from (i - left[i] + 1) to i.\n\n                The right part: the segment must start at i+1 and be strictly increasing, so the right part goes from i+1 to (i+1 + right[i+1] - 1) = i+right[i+1].\n\n            Then the total length without change at the break is left[i] + right[i+1] - 1 (because the element i is included in the left and the element i+1 is included in the right, but we have two distinct elements so we subtract one for the overlap? Actually, the two parts are disjoint: [l, i] and [i+1, r]. So the total length is left[i] + right[i+1].\n\n            Now, if we are allowed to change one element, we can fix the break and then the entire segment [l, r] (where l = i - left[i] + 1, r = i + right[i+1]) is the candidate.\n\n            But wait, the entire segment [l, i] is strictly increasing, and [i+1, r] is strictly increasing, and if we fix the break then the entire segment must be strictly increasing.\n\n            Conditions:\n\n                For changing a[i]:\n\n                    We require that the left part's last element (a[i-1]) is less than the right part's first element (a[i+1])? Actually, we require that we can set a[i] to be greater than a[i-1] and less than a[i+1]. So the condition is a[i-1] < a[i+1].\n\n                    Then the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n                For changing a[i+1]:\n\n                    We require that a[i] < a[i+2] (if i+2 exists) OR if i+2 does not exist, then we don't have to worry about the right side. But wait, the entire segment must be strictly increasing, so we require a[i] < (new a[i+1]). And if there is a[i+2], then (new a[i+1]) < a[i+2]. But note: we are allowed to choose any integer, so we can set a[i+1] to any value. The condition is:\n\n                        If we change a[i+1], then we must have a[i] < (new a[i+1]) and if there is a[i+2] then (new a[i+1]) < a[i+2]. \n\n                    However, the original a[i+1] might be less than a[i+2] (so the right part is increasing) but we are changing a[i+1] to a value that must be less than a[i+2] (if we have a[i+2]) and greater than a[i]. \n\n                    But note: we don't require the original a[i+1] to be less than a[i+2] for the change to be valid? Actually, we can set a[i+1] to a value that is greater than a[i] and less than a[i+2] (if i+2 exists). But if the original a[i+1] is greater than a[i+2], then we cannot set a[i+1] to a value that is both greater than a[i] and less than a[i+2] (if a[i] >= a[i+2] then there is no solution). \n\n                    Actually, we require that a[i] < a[i+2] (if i+2 exists) for the change to be possible (because we can set a[i+1] to a value between a[i] and a[i+2]). \n\n                    However, if i+2 does not exist, then we can set a[i+1] to any value greater than a[i] (and there is no upper bound).\n\n            Therefore, the candidate length for the break at i (by changing a[i]) is: left[i] + right[i+1] (because the entire segment from (i - left[i] + 1) to (i + right[i+1]) is taken, and note that the element at i is included and the element at i+1 is included, and we are fixing the break at i, so the segment is continuous).\n\n            But wait: the left[i] gives the length of the increasing segment ending at i. So the left part starts at i - left[i] + 1. Similarly, the right[i+1] gives the length of the increasing segment starting at i+1, so the right part ends at i + right[i+1].\n\n            Then the entire segment is from i - left[i] + 1 to i + right[i+1], and the length is (i + right[i+1] - (i - left[i] + 1) + 1) = left[i] + right[i+1].\n\n            However, we must check the conditions for the change:\n\n                Condition for changing a[i]: a[i-1] < a[i+1] (if i>=1, then we have a[i-1]; if i==0, then we don't have a left neighbor, so we only require that the left part is of length 1 (so we don't check a[-1]) and we can set a[0] to a value less than a[1]? Actually, if i==0, then the left part is [a0] and we change a0, then we require that the new a0 is less than a1. But note: the entire segment from 0 to right[i+1]-1 must be strictly increasing. Since the left part is just [a0] and we change a0, then the condition for the left side is automatically satisfied (because the left part is just one element). And for the right side, we require nothing for the left side? Actually, the condition for the entire segment is that the element at 0 must be less than the element at 1 (the new one). But we can set a0 to any integer, so we set it to a value less than a1. However, we must also consider the next element: the entire segment from 0 to the end of the right part must be strictly increasing. But note: the right part is strictly increasing and the element at 0 is set to a value less than a1, so the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n                Similarly, for changing a[i+1]: \n                    If i+2 exists, we require a[i] < a[i+2] (so that we can set a[i+1] to a value between a[i] and a[i+2]).\n                    If i+2 does not exist, then we don't need the condition.\n\n            However, note: the entire segment must be strictly increasing. When we change a[i] (or a[i+1]), we are effectively merging the two parts. \n\n            But wait: what if the break is at the beginning (i=0) and we change a[0]? Then the entire segment is from 0 to right[1]-1. The condition is that the new a0 must be less than a1. We can do that.\n\n            Similarly, if the break is at the end (i = n-2) and we change a[n-1]? Actually, the break is between i and i+1, so i must be from 0 to n-2. Changing a[i] (the last element) is allowed if i = n-2, then we require a[n-3] < a[n-1] (if n>=3) or if n==2 then we don't have a[n-3] and we can set a[n-2] to any value less than a[n-1].\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n            Let ans = max(left)   # because we can have a segment without change\n\n            Then, for each break i (from 0 to n-2):\n\n                Option A: Change a[i] to fix the break.\n\n                    Condition: \n                        1. The left part must be strictly increasing (which it is, by definition of left[i]).\n                        2. The right part must be strictly increasing (by definition of right[i+1]).\n                        3. We can set a[i] to a value between a[i-1] and a[i+1] (if i>0 then we have a[i-1]; if i==0, then we don't have a left element, so we only require that a[i] (the new one) is less than a[i+1] and we can set it arbitrarily to any integer, so we can always do that if i==0).\n\n                    Actually, we can unify:\n\n                        If i == 0:\n                            Condition: none for the left (we set a[0] to any value less than a[1]), so we can always fix the break at i=0 by changing a[0].\n                            Then candidate = left[0] + right[1]   [But note: left[0] is 1, so candidate = 1 + right[1]]\n\n                        If i > 0:\n                            Condition: a[i-1] < a[i+1]   (so that there exists an integer between a[i-1] and a[i+1])\n\n                    Then candidate = left[i] + right[i+1]   (the entire segment from (i - left[i] + 1) to (i + right[i+1]) )\n\n                Option B: Change a[i+1] to fix the break.\n\n                    Condition:\n                        1. The left part is strictly increasing (given by left[i]).\n                        2. The right part (without a[i+1] being considered for the condition) is strictly increasing, but note: if we change a[i+1], we require that the new a[i+1] is greater than a[i] and less than a[i+2] (if i+2 exists). \n\n                    However, if i+2 exists, we require a[i] < a[i+2] (so that there exists an integer between a[i] and a[i+2] for the new a[i+1]). But note: the condition for the entire segment is that the new a[i+1] must be greater than a[i] and less than a[i+2] (if i+2 exists). If i+2 doesn't exist, then we don't require the upper bound.\n\n                    Also, note: the right part (starting at i+1) originally is strictly increasing, so the condition for the rest of the segment (from i+2 to the end) is maintained as long as the new a[i+1] is less than a[i+2] (if exists). But if the original a[i+1] is greater than a[i+2], then after change we set a[i+1] to a value less than a[i+2] (if exists) and greater than a[i]. But note: the condition for the break is that a[i] >= a[i+1] (before change). After change, we set a[i+1] to be greater than a[i] and (if exists) less than a[i+2]. \n\n                    However, the condition for the entire segment is:\n\n                        ... , a[i] < (new a[i+1]), and if i+2 exists, then (new a[i+1]) < a[i+2].\n\n                    But the existence of the break (a[i] >= a[i+1]) doesn't tell us about the relation between a[i] and a[i+2]. We require that a[i] < a[i+2] (if i+2 exists) for the change to be possible.\n\n                    Steps for Option B:\n\n                        If i+2 < n (i.e., exists):\n                            Condition: a[i] < a[i+2]\n                        Else (i+2 doesn't exist):\n                            Condition: none (we can set a[i+1] to any value greater than a[i])\n\n                    Then candidate = left[i] + right[i+1]   (same as Option A)\n\n            Then, we take the maximum candidate from all breaks and compare with the initial ans.\n\n        However, note: the above candidate for a break at i (both options) uses the entire left[i] and right[i+1] segments. But what if the entire segment from (i - left[i] + 1) to (i + right[i+1]) is longer than necessary? Actually, we are using the maximum possible extension for the left and right parts. But note: the problem allows any subsegment. So we are considering the maximal extension for each break.\n\n        But wait: is it possible that a break at i can be fixed and we can extend beyond the left[i] and right[i+1]? \n\n            The left[i] is the maximal increasing segment ending at i (so we cannot extend the left part further to the left). Similarly, the right[i+1] is the maximal increasing segment starting at i+1.\n\n        Therefore, the candidate for a break at i is the entire segment from (i - left[i] + 1) to (i + right[i+1]), and the length is left[i] + right[i+1].\n\n        But note: the break is at i (between i and i+1). The entire segment we are considering is the union of the left part (ending at i) and the right part (starting at i+1). We are allowed to change one element (either i or i+1) to fix the break.\n\n        However, what if there are multiple breaks? Then we cannot fix two breaks with one change. So we must ensure that the entire segment [l, r] has at most one break (the one we are fixing). But note: we are only considering one break (the one at i). The left part and the right part are strictly increasing by themselves, and the break is the only non-increasing adjacent pair in the entire segment. \n\n        But wait: what if the entire segment [l, r] (from i-left[i]+1 to i+right[i+1]) has more than one break? Then even after fixing the break at i, the segment might not be strictly increasing. \n\n        Example: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] \n            Breaks: \n                between 2 and 4: none (2<4)\n                between 4 and 3: break\n                between 3 and 5: none (3<5)\n\n            Now, if we consider the break at i=3 (between 4 and 3) and try to fix by changing 4 (then set 4 to 2.5, then we get [1,2,2.5,3,5] -> wait, but then the break between 2 and 2.5 is fixed? Actually, no: the entire segment from 0 to 4 is [1,2,2.5,3,5] which is strictly increasing. \n\n            But wait, the left part for i=3: \n                left[3] = 3 (because [1,2,4] is strictly increasing, but wait: [1,2,4] is strictly increasing, so left[3]=3 (since 2<4). Then the segment we consider is from 0 to 3+right[4]-1. What is right[4]? \n                The array: [1,2,4,3,5] -> right[4] = 2 (because from index4: [5] is increasing, but wait, let's compute right:\n\n                Compute left for [1,2,4,3,5]:\n                    left[0]=1\n                    left[1]=2 (2>1)\n                    left[2]=3 (4>2)\n                    left[3]=1 (3<=4 -> reset)\n                    left[4]=2 (5>3)\n\n                Compute right for [1,2,4,3,5]:\n                    right[4]=1\n                    right[3]= max(1, right[4]+1 if 3<5? -> 3<5 -> right[3]=right[4]+1=2) -> actually, from index3: [3,5] -> 2\n                    right[2]=1 (because 4>3 -> so reset) -> actually, from index2: [4] then next is 3 which is <4, so right[2]=1\n                    right[1]=2 (because 2<4 -> then right[1]=right[2]+1=1+1=2? But wait, the definition: \n                        right[i] = 1 if a[i] >= a[i+1] else right[i+1]+1\n                    So:\n                        right[4]=1\n                        right[3]= (3<5) -> 1+right[4]=2\n                        right[2]= (4>=3) -> 1\n                        right[1]= (2<4) -> 1+right[2]= 1+1=2\n                        right[0]= (1<2) -> 1+right[1]=3\n\n                Then, for break at i=2 (between a[2] and a[3]): \n                    Option A: change a[2] (which is 4) to something between a[1]=2 and a[3]=3. So we require 2 < x < 3. Then the entire segment from 0 to 3+right[3]-1 = 0 to 3+2-1 = 4, i.e., the entire array. Then we check: \n                        [1,2, x, 3,5] is strictly increasing? \n                        Conditions: 1<2, 2<x, x<3, 3<5. Yes.\n\n                Now, the candidate for break at i=2 (changing a[2]) is left[2] + right[3] = 3+2 = 5.\n\n                But note: the entire array is of length 5, so we can take the entire array.\n\n            However, note: the example [1,2,4,3,5] has two breaks: one at (2,4) is not a break (increasing) and one at (4,3) is a break. So only one break.\n\n        But consider: [1, 3, 2, 4]\n\n            left: [1,2,1,2]\n            right: [1,2,2,1] -> wait, let me compute:\n\n                a = [1,3,2,4]\n\n                left[0]=1\n                left[1]= (3>1) -> 2\n                left[2]= (2<=3) -> 1\n                left[3]= (4>2) -> 2\n\n                right[3]=1\n                right[2]= (2<4) -> 1+right[3]=2\n                right[1]= (3>=2) -> 1\n                right[0]= (1<3) -> 1+right[1]=2\n\n            Breaks: at i=1 (between 3 and 2) and at i=2 (between 2 and 4) is not a break because 2<4.\n\n            For break at i=1 (between 3 and 2):\n\n                Option A: change a[1] (3) to something between a[0]=1 and a[2]=2. Condition: 1 < x < 2. Then the entire segment from 0 to 1+right[2]-1 = 0 to 1+2-1 = 2 (so [1,x,2]) and then the next element 4 is not included? Actually, we are taking the entire left[1]=2 (so from 0 to 1) and the entire right[2]=2 (from 2 to 3). Then the segment is from 0 to 3, i.e., [1, x, 2, 4]. The condition for the entire segment is:\n\n                    1 < x < 2, and 2 < 4 -> so the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n                Candidate length = left[1] + right[2] = 2+2 = 4.\n\n            But wait, the entire array is of length 4, so that's the whole array.\n\n            However, note: the entire array [1, x, 2, 4] is strictly increasing. So we can fix the break at i=1 and get a segment of length 4.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            Steps:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            left = [1]*n\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n                    left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n                else:\n                    left[i] = 1\n\n            right = [1]*n\n            for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n                if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n                    right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n                else:\n                    right[i] = 1\n\n            ans = max(max(left), max(right))   # at least a contiguous increasing segment\n\n            # Now consider breaks at i (from 0 to n-2)\n            for i in range(0, n-1):\n                # Option A: change a[i]\n                if i == 0:\n                    # Only condition: we can set a0 to a value less than a1.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsegment of a given sequence where at most one number can be changed to make the entire subsegment strictly increasing. The solution involves analyzing the sequence to identify potential subsegments that can be made strictly increasing with a single modification.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - **Left Array (`left`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at each index `i`.\n   - **Right Array (`right`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at each index `i`.\n\n2. **Initial Maximum Length**: The answer is initially set to the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any modifications (the maximum value in either `left` or `right` arrays).\n\n3. **Check for Breaks**: For each possible break between two adjacent elements in the sequence, determine if changing one element can merge the left and right increasing subsegments into a longer strictly increasing subsegment. This involves:\n   - **Changing the Current Element (`a[i]`)**: Check if the left subsegment ending at `i` and the right subsegment starting at `i+1` can be merged by setting `a[i]` to a value between `a[i-1]` and `a[i+1]`.\n   - **Changing the Next Element (`a[i+1]`)**: Check if `a[i]` is less than `a[i+2]` (if it exists) to allow setting `a[i+1]` to a value between `a[i]` and `a[i+2]`.\n\n4. **Update Answer**: For each valid break, compute the potential subsegment length and update the answer if this length is greater than the current maximum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            left[i] = 1\n            \n    right = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right[i] = 1\n            \n    ans = max(max(left), max(right))\n    \n    for i in range(n-1):\n        if i == 0:\n            candidate = left[i] + right[i+1]\n            if candidate > ans:\n                ans = candidate\n        else:\n            if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                candidate = left[i] + right[i+1]\n                if candidate > ans:\n                    ans = candidate\n                    \n        if i == n-2:\n            candidate = left[i] + right[i+1]\n            if candidate > ans:\n                ans = candidate\n        else:\n            if a[i] < a[i+2]:\n                candidate = left[i] + right[i+1]\n                if candidate > ans:\n                    ans = candidate\n                    \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length `n` and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the sequence has only one element, the answer is trivially 1.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays Calculation**: The `left` array is filled by iterating from left to right, incrementing the count if the current element is greater than the previous one. The `right` array is filled by iterating from right to left for the same condition.\n4. **Initial Answer Setup**: The initial answer is the maximum value found in either `left` or `right`, representing the longest strictly increasing subsegment without modifications.\n5. **Break Checking Loop**: For each adjacent pair in the sequence, the code checks if changing one element can merge the left and right subsegments. The conditions ensure that the merged subsegment can be strictly increasing after the modification.\n6. **Output**: The maximum length found during the checks is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking specific segments around potential breaks, leveraging precomputed arrays to avoid redundant calculations and ensure optimal performance.",
