            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Radio Towers\n\nThere are $$$n + 2$$$ towns located on a coordinate line, numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n + 1$$$. The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe have n+2 towns (from 0 to n+1) and we build towers in towns 1 to n with independent probability 1/2.\n\nConstraints:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal.\n2. Each town from 1 to n must be covered by exactly one radio tower.\n\nThe signal from a tower at town i with power p reaches [i-p+1, i+p-1] (since |c-i| < p, so c in [i-p+1, i+p-1] but note that the condition is strict inequality). However, note that the problem says \"reaches every city c such that |c-i| < p\", which means the coverage is from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Actually, the integer points c satisfy |c-i| < p. So for example, if p=1, then |c-i|<1 -> c=i. If p=2, then |c-i|<2 -> c can be i-1 or i+1, but not i (if we consider integer c, then it's from i-1 to i+1, excluding i? Actually, wait: the condition is |c-i| < p, so for integer c, we have c from floor(i-p+1) to ceil(i+p-1)? But since i is an integer and c is integer, the condition becomes c in [i-p+1, i+p-1] (because |c-i| < p => -p < c-i < p => i-p < c < i+p, and since c is integer, c from floor(i-p)+1 to ceil(i+p)-1, but actually we can write as integers from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Let me check:\n\nExample: i=2, p=2: then |c-2| < 2 -> c can be 1, 2, 3? But wait, 2-2=0, and |0|=0<2 -> c=2 is included? Actually, the condition is |c-i| < p, so for c=2: |2-2|=0 < 2 -> yes. Then for c=1: |1-2|=1 <2 -> yes. For c=3: |3-2|=1 <2 -> yes. So actually, the coverage is [i-p+1, i+p-1] is not matching. Actually, the condition |c-i| < p gives: i-p < c < i+p, so for integer c, we have c from i-p+1 to i+p-1 is incorrect because when p is integer, the open interval (i-p, i+p) contains all integers from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Actually, no: the open interval (i-p, i+p) for integer i and p, the integers are from floor(i-p)+1 to ceil(i+p)-1, but since i and p are integers, that is from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Let me compute:\n\nLet i=2, p=2: then (0,4) -> integers 1,2,3. So the set {1,2,3} = [1,3] = [i-p+1, i+p-1] indeed: i-p+1 = 1, i+p-1=3.\n\nBut wait, what if p=1? Then (i-1, i+1) -> integers from i to i? Actually, for i=2, p=1: (1,3) -> integers 2. So that matches [2-1+1, 2+1-1] = [2,2].\n\nSo the coverage of a tower at i with power p is the set of cities from (i-p+1) to (i+p-1), inclusive.\n\nNow, the constraints:\n\n1. Town 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n\n   For town 0: no tower should cover it. A tower at j (from 1 to n) covers town 0 if there exists a tower at j with power p such that |0-j| < p. This is equivalent to j < p. Since p>=1, the smallest j is 1, so we require that for every j that is built, the power p_j must be <= j (so that j < p_j is false). Actually, we require that j >= p_j? Not exactly: the condition for covering 0 is |0-j| < p_j -> j < p_j. Therefore, to avoid covering 0, for every built tower at j, we must set p_j <= j (so that j is not less than p_j, meaning j>=p_j). Similarly, for town n+1:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns (from 1 to n) with independent probability 1/2, we can set signal powers for each tower such that:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n2. Each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for each town `i` (from 1 to n), the signal power `p_i` must be chosen such that:\n   - The tower at `i` covers town `i` (which is always true if `p_i >= 1`).\n   - The tower at `i` does not cover towns `i-1` or `i+1` (if they exist), unless those towns are covered by another tower. However, the constraint requires that each town is covered by exactly one tower, so the coverage must be precisely defined.\n\n2. **Insight**: For a tower at position `i`, the signal power `p_i` must be exactly 1. This ensures that the tower covers only town `i` (since `|c - i| < 1` implies `c = i`). However, this is only possible if the towers are built in such a way that there are no overlapping coverages. Specifically, if two consecutive towns both have towers, then setting both signal powers to 1 would cause their adjacent towns to overlap, violating the constraint.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**: The solution involves identifying segments of consecutive towns where towers are built. For a segment of length `k` (i.e., `k` consecutive towns with towers), the probability that all towers in this segment can be set to signal power 1 without overlapping is `(1/2)^k * (number of valid configurations)`. However, a simpler observation is that the problem reduces to ensuring that no two adjacent towers are both built, because if two adjacent towers are built, setting their signal powers to 1 would cover the same adjacent town twice.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid tower configurations. Let `dp[i]` be the number of valid ways to place towers up to town `i` such that the constraints are satisfied. The recurrence relation is:\n   - If we do not build a tower at town `i`, then `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`.\n   - If we build a tower at town `i`, then the previous town (`i-1`) must not have a tower (to avoid adjacent towers), and `dp[i] += dp[i-2]`.\n\n5. **Modulo Handling**: Since the result can be very large, we compute everything modulo 998244353. The final answer is derived by considering all valid configurations and dividing by the total number of possible configurations (which is `2^n`), but note that the problem asks for the probability modulo 998244353.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    \n    dp0 = 1\n    dp1 = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        new_dp0 = (dp0 + dp1) % MOD\n        dp0, dp1 = dp1, new_dp0\n    \n    total = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_total = pow(total, MOD-2, MOD)\n    ans = dp0 * inv_total % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The `dp0` variable represents the number of valid configurations ending at the current town without building a tower, while `dp1` represents configurations ending with a tower built.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: For each town `i`, the number of valid configurations without building a tower (`new_dp0`) is the sum of configurations from the previous town (`dp0 + dp1`). If a tower is built at `i`, the previous town cannot have a tower, so we take `dp0` from two towns back.\n3. **Modulo Handling**: The result is computed modulo 998244353. The total number of configurations is `2^n`, and its modular inverse is used to compute the probability.\n4. **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5). The space complexity is O(1) as only the previous two states are stored.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid configurations and computes the required probability using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.",
