The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the ringroad is circular and we can only move clockwise, note that moving from house x to house y:\n   If x <= y: then the distance is (y - x) mod n? Actually, because it's circular and clockwise, but note that we can't go counterclockwise.\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So from house 1, moving to house 2,3,...,n, then back to 1.\n\n But observe: the houses are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. The movement is clockwise. Therefore, if we are at house x and want to go to house y:\n   There are two possibilities? Actually no, because we can only move clockwise. But note: the ring is circular. So the direct path from x to y is:\n      If x <= y: then we move (y - x) steps.\n      If x > y: then we move (n - x + y) steps.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\", and the road is one-way.\n\n But wait: we start at house 1 and have tasks to do in various houses. We must complete tasks in the order given (i.e., the i-th task must be done when visiting house a_i, and we must do all tasks with numbers less than i first). \n\n Important: Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So we don't need to account for staying at the same house.\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> Output: 6\n   Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> Output: 2\n\n How does the second example work?\n   Start at house 1.\n   Then task 1: house 2 -> move from 1 to 2: 1 step (clockwise: 1->2)\n   Then task 2: house 3 -> move from 2 to 3: 1 step\n   Then task 3: house 3 -> already there? so 0 steps.\n\n   Total: 1+1+0 = 2.\n\n But the first example:\n   Start at 1.\n   Task1: house 3 -> from 1 to 3: clockwise: 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n   Task2: house 2 -> from 3 to 2: since we can only move clockwise, we go 3->4->1->2 (which is 3 steps? But note: from 3 to 4: 1 step, 4 to 1: 1 step, 1 to 2: 1 step -> total 3 steps for this segment)\n   Task3: house 3 -> from 2 to 3: 1 step.\n\n   Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n However, the example output says 6.\n\n But wait, is there a better way? The example states: \n     1→2→3→4→1→2→3.\n\n Let me break down the example's moves:\n\n   Start at 1.\n   Then to 2: 1 step (total 1)\n   Then to 3: 1 step (total 2)\n   Then to 4: 1 step (total 3)\n   Then to 1: 1 step (total 4)\n   Then to 2: 1 step (total 5)\n   Then to 3: 1 step (total 6)\n\n But note: the tasks are [3,2,3]. So the first task is at 3: we must be at 3 by the time we finish the first task. Then the second task is at 2, and then the third at 3.\n\n The example solution does not require that we stop at 3 after the first task and then go to 2 without passing through 4 and 1? Actually, the problem says: \"she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i\". \n\n The key is: we can pass through houses arbitrarily, but we must complete the tasks in the given order.\n\n However, note: the problem states that initially she is at house 1, and then the first task requires her to be at house 3. Then the next task requires her to be at house 2 (but note: she has already completed the first task, so the condition is satisfied). Then the third task requires her to be at house 3 again.\n\n But the catch: the movement must be clockwise. Therefore, from 3 to 2, we cannot go directly. We must go 3->4->1->2.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The key observation here is that Xenia must complete tasks in the given order, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Xenia starts at house 1 and must visit a sequence of houses specified by the task locations. \n   - Movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, so moving from house `x` to house `y` involves traversing the ring road in the shortest clockwise path.\n   - The challenge is to compute the cumulative time taken to move from one task location to the next, considering the circular nature of the ring road.\n\n2. **Insight**:\n   - For each task location, the time taken to move from the previous task location to the current one depends on their positions. If the current task location is ahead (numerically higher) in the clockwise direction, the distance is simply the difference. If it's behind, the distance is calculated as `(n - previous_location + current_location)`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Process each task in sequence, calculating the time taken to move from the last task location to the current one.\n   - Accumulate these times to get the total time required to complete all tasks.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The algorithm processes each task exactly once, making it linear in time complexity, O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints (m ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if current <= a:\n            steps = a - current\n        else:\n            steps = n - current + a\n        total_time += steps\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The input is read and parsed into integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks), followed by the list of task locations.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task location `a` in the sequence:\n  - If the current position is less than or equal to `a`, the steps needed are simply `a - current`.\n  - If the current position is greater than `a`, the steps are calculated as `(n - current + a)` to account for the circular movement.\n- **Accumulation**: The steps for each move are added to `total_time`, and the current position is updated to the current task location.\n- **Output**: The accumulated total time is printed after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ring road and processing each task in sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
