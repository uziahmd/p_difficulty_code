Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\nWe are given:\n  - n and x (the number of found cards and the maximum absolute value on any card)\n  - a list of n integers (each between -x and x)\n\nWe can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x.\n\nGoal: We want to find the minimum number of additional cards (from the infinite set) such that the total sum of all the numbers (found plus additional) is zero.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n2. We need to achieve a total sum of 0, so we need to add cards that sum to -S.\n\nBut note: We can use any integers in the range [-x, x]. So, the problem reduces to: what is the minimum number of integers (each between -x and x) that we need to pick so that their sum is exactly -S?\n\nHowever, note that we might already have some cards that are not used? Actually, no: the problem says we are looking for the minimum number of cards to add (from the infinite set) to make the total sum zero.\n\nBut wait: the example input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> output 1. The current sum is (-1+1+2)=2. We need to add a card with value -2. And -2 is within [-2,2] (since x=2). So one card.\n\nAnother example: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> current sum is -4. We need to add cards that sum to 4. Since each card can be at most 3, we cannot do it with one card (because 3<4). But two cards: two 2s? 2+2=4. However, note: the example output is 2. But wait, the example says \"He can't find a single card\", so two is the answer.\n\nBut note: we can also use negative cards? Actually, no: because we need to add 4, so positive cards. But wait, the set includes negatives and positives. However, if we use negative cards then we would have to compensate by adding even more positive ones? Actually, no: we are free to choose any integer from -x to x. So we can choose positive and negative arbitrarily. However, we are trying to get a positive sum (4). So negative cards would actually make it harder (unless we mix them to get the exact sum). \n\nBut note: the problem is asking for the minimum number of cards. We are allowed to choose any integers (positive, negative, or zero) as long as they are in [-x, x]. \n\nSo we need to represent the target T = -S (which in the second example is 4) as the sum of k integers, each between -x and x, and we want the smallest k.\n\nConstraints: \n  - k must be at least ceil(|T| / (x)) ? Not exactly, because we can use negative numbers too, but we are trying to get a positive T (if T is positive) we can use positive numbers only. Similarly, if T is negative, we use negative numbers only. However, sometimes using both might help? Actually, no: because if we have a target T, then:\n\nCase 1: T >= 0.\n  We can use only positive numbers (and zeros) to achieve T. But note: we might use negative numbers and then compensate with more positive ones? That would require more cards. So the minimal k should be achieved by using the largest positive numbers (or negative for negative T) without mixing.\n\nBut wait, consider T=4 and x=3: \n  Using two 2s (each 2 is <=3) gives 4. Alternatively, could we use one 3 and one 1? Also two cards. Or three 1s and one 1? No, that would be four 1s. But two is minimal.\n\nBut note: what if T is negative? Then we use negative numbers.\n\nHowever, what if T is positive and we use negative numbers? Then we have to compensate by having even more positive numbers. For example, T=5, x=3: \n  Without negative: 3+2=5 -> two cards.\n  With negative: say we use one negative, then we have to cover 5 and -a (a positive) so the remaining is 5+a, which must be achieved by positive numbers. Then the total sum would be (positive_sum) - a = 5. This requires positive_sum = 5+a, which is larger than 5. Then the total number of cards would be (number of positives) + 1. Since the minimal positive_sum for (5+a) is (5+a) (if we use as few as possible) then the minimal number of cards would be ceil((5+a)/3) + 1. But note a>=1, so (5+a)>=6, which requires at least 2 cards (ceil(6/3)=2) so total 3 cards. This is worse than 2.\n\nTherefore, it's always optimal to use the same sign as T (unless T=0, then we don't need any card).\n\nBut wait: what if T is zero? Then we don't need any card.\n\nSo the problem becomes: \n  Let T = -S (the target sum we need from the additional cards)\n  If T == 0: answer 0.\n\n  Otherwise, we need to represent T as the sum of k integers, each in [-x, x], and we want the minimum k.\n\nHowever, note: we are allowed to use any integers in [-x, x]. So we can use:\n\n  For T>0: use positive numbers (at least one positive) and possibly zeros, but zeros don't help. The best is to use the largest positive numbers (x) as much as possible.\n\n  Similarly, for T<0: use the largest negative numbers (which is -x) as much as possible.\n\nBut note: we can also use negative numbers for positive T? Actually, we don't want to because that would require more cards. So we stick to the same sign.\n\nHowever, there is an exception: sometimes we can use a combination of positive and negative to get a better (smaller) k? Let me think: \n\nExample: T=1, x=2. \n  Without mixing: we can use one card: 1 (if 1 is in [-2,2]) -> so k=1.\n\nBut what if T=1 and x=1? Then we must use one card: 1.\n\nWhat if T=3, x=2?\n  Without mixing: we can use one card: 3 is not allowed (max is 2). Then two cards: 2+1=3 -> but wait, 1 is allowed (since |1|<=2). So two cards.\n  Alternatively, if we use negative? Then we need to have two cards: first a negative, then a positive. But the negative must be at least -2 (so the positive must be at least 3 - (-2) ??? Wait, no: the total is negative + positive = 3. So positive = 3 - negative. But note: negative is between -2 and -1 (since we are using integers). Then positive would be 3 - (-2)=5, which is greater than 2 -> not allowed. Or 3 - (-1)=4, also not allowed. So mixing doesn't help.\n\nWait, but what if we use more than two cards? Actually, we are looking for the minimum k.\n\nBut consider: T=5, x=3.\n  Without mixing: use two cards: 3+2=5 -> k=2.\n\nNow, what if T=8, x=3? \n  Without mixing: 3+3+2=8 -> k=3.\n  With mixing: can we do better? Let's say we use two cards: maximum positive is 3+3=6, which is less than 8. So no. Three cards: 3+3+2=8, so 3.\n\nBut wait, what about T=4, x=3? \n  Without mixing: two cards: 3+1=4 -> k=2.\n\nBut note: we can also use negative numbers and then compensate with more positives? Actually, we are trying to minimize the number of cards. We are only concerned with the minimal k.\n\nHowever, note: the problem is symmetric for positive and negative. So we can assume T is non-negative by symmetry (if T is negative, multiply by -1 and solve for positive, then the same method applies).\n\nSo algorithm for T>0:\n\n  We want to represent T as the sum of k integers, each between 1 and x (we can use zeros? but zeros don't help, so we ignore zeros because they don't change the sum and we want minimal k). Actually, we can use zeros, but they don't contribute. So we can ignore zeros because they only increase k without helping.\n\n  Therefore, we are effectively representing T as the sum of k integers, each between 1 and x (if T>0) or between -x and -1 (if T<0). But wait, we are allowed to use negative numbers when T>0? But we saw that mixing makes it worse. So we can restrict to positive numbers for T>0.\n\n  Then the problem is: what is the minimal k such that k*x >= T? But wait, we can also use numbers less than x. However, we are allowed to use any integer in [1,x]. So the maximum sum we can get with k cards is k*x, and the minimum (if we use positive) is k*1. But we don't require consecutive integers, just any integers from 1 to x.\n\n  Actually, we can use the same number multiple times.\n\n  So the condition for T (positive) is: we need k such that k*x >= T, and also k must be at least ceil(T/x) if we were to use only the maximum x? But wait, we can use different numbers. The minimal k is the smallest integer k such that the maximum sum we can form with k cards (which is k*x) is at least T.\n\n  However, note: we don't necessarily have to use the maximum x every time. But the minimal k is determined by: since each card can contribute at most x, we need at least ceil(T/x) cards. But wait, is that sufficient?\n\n  Example: T=5, x=3 -> ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. And indeed, we can do 3+2=5.\n\n  But wait: what if T=7, x=3? ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3. And 3+3+1=7, so yes.\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to use any integer in [1, x] (for positive T). So the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= T? Actually, no: because we can use numbers less than x. But the necessary condition is that the total of k cards (each at most x) must be at least T. So we require k*x >= T.\n\n  But is that sufficient? Yes, because we can use the greedy algorithm: use as many x's as possible and then adjust with a smaller number. However, note: we are allowed to use any integer, so if k*x >= T, then we can form T by having:\n\n      k1 = floor(T/x)   (using x repeated k1 times) and then the remainder r = T % x. But if r==0, then we use k1 cards. If r>0, then we use k1+1 cards (because one card will be r, which is between 1 and x-1). But note: k1+1 might be more than ceil(T/x). Actually, ceil(T/x) is the same as (T+x-1)//x (integer ceiling division).\n\n  However, wait: the minimal k is the ceiling of T/x? Because:\n\n      k_min = ceil(T/x)\n\n  But note: k_min is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= T.\n\n  Example: T=5, x=3 -> ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2, and 2*3>=5 -> true.\n\n  Example: T=6, x=3 -> ceil(6/3)=2, and 2*3=6>=6.\n\n  Example: T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2, and 2*3=6>=4.\n\n  So the minimal k for positive T is ceil(T/x). Similarly, for negative T (let U=-T, then minimal k is ceil(U/x)).\n\nBut wait, what if we are allowed to use zeros? Then we can use zeros to increase the count without changing the sum. But we are trying to minimize the number of cards, so we wouldn't use zeros because they don't help. So we ignore zeros.\n\nHowever, note: we are allowed to use zeros. But zeros don't help in achieving the target. So we don't need them.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch: what if T is negative? Then we are representing T (negative) as the sum of k integers, each between -x and -1 (if we use negative) or zeros (useless) or positives (which would require even more negatives). So we use the same logic: minimal k is ceil(|T|/x).\n\nBut wait, consider the example: \n  Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, and the two cards are -2 and -2. Current sum S=-4. Then T = 4 (positive). Then k = ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. So we output 2.\n\nAnother example: \n  Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> n=3, x=2, the cards are -1,1,2. Current sum=2. Then T=-2 (wait, no: T=-S=-2). Then we need to represent T=-2. Then minimal k = ceil(|-2|/2)=ceil(2/2)=1.\n\nBut wait, the example output is 1. So that matches.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Then we are representing T (negative) as the sum of k integers, each in [-x,0]. Actually, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*(-x) <= T (which is negative). But note: we are using negative numbers, so the condition is: we need k such that the sum of k negative numbers (each >= -x) is <= T. But wait, we want the sum to be exactly T (which is negative). \n\nActually, we can use the same reasoning: the minimal k is ceil(|T|/x) because:\n\n  Each card can contribute at least -x (so the total sum from k cards is at least -k*x). We need the total sum to be at least T (which is negative, so T is less than 0). The condition is: -k*x <= T? Actually, no: we are forming T (negative) by adding negative numbers. The worst-case (largest negative) is -x per card. So we can form any negative number T (as long as T >= -k*x) by choosing appropriate negative numbers (because we can use zeros and positives too? Actually, no: we are restricted to negative numbers to minimize the count). But wait, we can use zeros and positives? However, using zeros or positives would make the total sum larger (closer to zero), which is not helpful for a negative T. So we stick to negative numbers.\n\nBut note: the problem allows any integers in [-x,x]. So we can use negative numbers and positive numbers arbitrarily. However, we argued that mixing signs increases the number of cards required. So we can use only negative numbers for negative T.\n\nThen, the condition is: we need to represent T (negative) as the sum of k negative integers (each between -x and 0). The minimal k is the smallest k such that we can form T (which is negative) with k cards. \n\nBut note: we can use the same reasoning as for positive T. The minimal k must satisfy: the maximum negative sum we can get with k cards is -k*x (by using -x each time). And we need -k*x <= T (because T is negative and we are going to make it even more negative? Actually, wait: we want the total to be T (which is negative). The negative numbers we use must add up to T. Since each card is at least -x (so the total is at least -k*x), then we require that the total is T, so we must have:\n\n  k*x >= |T|\n\nbecause |T| is the absolute value of the negative T, and we are using negative numbers (each of absolute value at most x) so the total absolute value we can get is at most k*x (if we use the maximum absolute value). But note: we can use any negative number, so we can form T if and only if k*x >= |T|.\n\nAnd then the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, is that correct for negative T? \n\nExample: T=-4, x=3 -> |T|=4, ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. Then we can form -4 by two cards: -3 and -1, or -2 and -2, etc.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use negative numbers arbitrarily, so the condition is: the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|. \n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n  Step 1: Read n and x, then the list of n integers.\n  Step 2: Compute the current sum S.\n  Step 3: Let T = -S (the target sum we need from the additional cards).\n  Step 4: If T == 0: print 0.\n  Step 5: Else, let abs_T = abs(T)\n          k = ceil(abs_T / x)\n\nBut wait: is that always sufficient? \n\nConsider: T=5, x=3 -> k=ceil(5/3)=2. Then we can form 5 with two cards (3+2). But wait, 2 is allowed (since |2|<=3). Similarly, T=4, x=3: ceil(4/3)=2, and 3+1=4.\n\nBut what if T=1, x=1000? ceil(1/1000)=1, and we can use 1.\n\nBut what if T=0? Then we don't need any card.\n\nBut wait: what if T is very large? For example, T=10000, x=1 -> ceil(10000/1)=10000. That's correct.\n\nHowever, note: the problem says the initial set has cards from -x to x. But our reasoning holds.\n\nBut wait: is there a possibility that we can use a mix of positive and negative to get a smaller k? \n\nLet me try with T=1, x=2. \n  Without mixing: ceil(1/2)=1. So we use one card: 1.\n  With mixing: can we get 1 with 0 cards? No. Or with 1 card: yes. So no improvement.\n\nWhat about T=3, x=2? \n  Without mixing: ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. We can do 2+1=3 (two cards). \n  With mixing: can we do it with one card? One card must be 3, but 3>2 -> not allowed. So two is minimal.\n\nWhat about T=5, x=3: ceil(5/3)=2, and we do 3+2=5. \n\nBut what about T=6, x=3: ceil(6/3)=2, and 3+3=6.\n\nWhat about T=7, x=3: ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3, and 3+3+1=7.\n\nBut wait, consider T=8, x=3: ceil(8/3)=ceil(2.66)=3, but 3+3+2=8 -> so 3 cards.\n\nBut is there a case where mixing positive and negative actually reduces the number of cards?\n\nWait, note: we are representing a positive T. Suppose we use one negative card, then we have to compensate by having a larger positive sum. For example, T=1, x=2. \n  If we use one negative card (say -1), then we need the rest to sum to 2. Then we can use one card of 2. Then total two cards: -1+2=1. But that is two cards, which is more than the one-card solution.\n\nSimilarly, T=2, x=2: \n  Without mixing: one card of 2 -> 1 card.\n  With mixing: two cards: for example, 3 is not allowed (x=2). So we can use 1 and 1: 1+1=2 (two cards) but wait, 1+1 is two cards. Alternatively, we can use 2 (one card). So without mixing is better.\n\nBut consider T=4, x=3: \n  Without mixing: two cards: 3+1=4 -> two cards.\n  With mixing: one card: we need 4, but 4>3 -> not allowed. Two cards: we can do 3+1=4 (without mixing) or 2+2=4 (without mixing). Or mix: 3 and 1 is without mixing. What if we use negative? Then we need the positive part to be 4 + |negative|, so the positive part must be at least 4+1=5 (if we use -1) then two cards: 3 and 2 (3+2=5) then subtract 1? But wait, the two cards are 3 and 2 and then we have a third card of -1? Then three cards: 3+2-1=4. But that's three, which is worse.\n\nSo it seems that mixing doesn't help.\n\nBut wait, what if T=0? Then we don't need any card, but what if we have to use at least one card? The problem says: we are to find the minimum number of cards to add. So if T=0, we don't need to add any.\n\nHowever, wait: what if T=0 but we are forced to add at least one card? The problem does not say that. It says \"minimum number of cards to find\", so 0 is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what if T=0? Then we don't need to add any.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero\". Initially, we have n cards. We can add zero cards and the sum remains S. So if S is already 0, then we don't need to add any.\n\nBut wait: the example input might have S=0? Then we output 0.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\n  S = sum(found_cards)\n  T = -S\n\n  if T == 0:\n      print(0)\n  else:\n      k = ceil(|T| / x)\n\nBut wait: what if T is negative? Then we use |T|, and the minimal k is ceil(|T|/x). So we can write:\n\n  import math\n  k = math.ceil(abs(T) / x)\n\nHowever, note: the division in Python for integers: if we use integer division, we have to be careful. But abs(T) and x are integers, but the division might be float.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: n and x from 1 to 1000, and the numbers are integers.\n\nBut wait: is ceil(|T|/x) always the minimal k?\n\nLet me test with T=1, x=2: ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1 -> correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T is negative? Then we use |T|, so same.\n\nBut wait: what if T is not divisible by x? Then ceil(|T|/x) is the minimal k.\n\nBut wait: consider T=5, x=3: ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.666)=2 -> correct.\n\nBut wait: consider T=6, x=3: ceil(6/3)=ceil(2)=2 -> correct.\n\nBut wait: consider T=7, x=3: ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3 -> correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=0? Then we skip and output 0.\n\nBut wait: what if T is positive and very small, say T=1, x=1000 -> 1 card.\n\nHowever, wait: there is a catch. The above reasoning assumes that we can use any integer in [-x, x] arbitrarily. But note: the problem says that the initial set had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use any integer in that range arbitrarily.\n\nBut wait, consider T=3, x=2: \n  We need to form 3. With two cards: 2+1=3 -> allowed because 1 is in [-2,2]. So k=2.\n\nBut what if we cannot form T exactly with k cards? \n\nWait, the condition is: we can form T if k*x >= T (for positive T) and we can choose integers arbitrarily (any integer from 1 to x). \n\nBut note: we are allowed to use any integer, so if k*x >= T, then we can form T. Because we can use as many x's as needed and then adjust with a smaller number. \n\nBut wait, what if T=5, x=3: 2*3=6>=5 -> we can use one 3 and one 2 (which is 3+2=5). \n\nBut what if T=5, x=2? Then ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. Then 3*2=6>=5, so we can form 5. How? We use two 2s and one 1: 2+2+1=5. But wait, x=2, so the available numbers are [-2,2]. We can use 1 and 2. \n\nBut wait, what if T=5, x=2? Then we can form 5 with three cards: 2+2+1=5. But note: 1 is allowed because |1|<=2.\n\nSo the condition k*x>=T is necessary and sufficient for positive T (with the ability to use any integer from 1 to x). Similarly for negative T (using any integer from -x to -1).\n\nBut wait, what if T is positive and T is 0? Then we skip.\n\nBut wait: what if T is negative and we use positive numbers? Then we are effectively making the sum even more positive? That would be bad. So we use negative numbers only.\n\nBut note: the problem does not restrict the sign of the added cards. But we are free to choose. However, we proved that using the same sign as T (if T is positive, use positive; if T is negative, use negative) is optimal.\n\nTherefore, the code:\n\n  import math\n\n  data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n  n = int(data[0]); x = int(data[1])\n  cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n\n  total = sum(cards)\n  T = -total\n\n  if T == 0:\n      print(0)\n  else:\n      # We need to form T (which is either positive or negative) with the minimal number of cards, each in [-x, x].\n      # Since we can use any integer in [-x, x], the minimal k is ceil(|T|/x)\n      k = math.ceil(abs(T) / x)\n      print(int(k))\n\nBut wait: what if T is positive and very large, but x=1? Then k=T, which is correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T is negative and we use the same formula? Then we use ceil(|T|/x) and that's the answer.\n\nHowever, wait: consider the example from the problem: \n  Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> total = -4, T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> output 2. Correct.\n\nBut wait, wait: the example input was \"2 3\\n-2 -2\", and the output is 2.\n\nBut wait, what if T=3, x=3? Then ceil(3/3)=ceil(1)=1. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T=4, x=4? Then ceil(4/4)=1. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T=5, x=4? Then ceil(5/4)=ceil(1.25)=2. Then we need two cards. The maximum we can get from one card is 4, so we need two cards. 4+1=5, and 1 is allowed (|1|<=4). Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=5, x=3? Then ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. Then we need two cards. 3+2=5, and 2 is allowed (|2|<=3). Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=1, x=1? Then ceil(1/1)=1. Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=0? Then we output 0.\n\nBut wait: what if the current sum is 0? Then T=0, output 0.\n\nBut wait: what if the current sum is not 0, but very close to 0? Then T is non-zero, and we compute ceil(|T|/x). \n\nThis seems to be the solution.\n\nBut wait, wait: there is a flaw.\n\nConsider T=2, x=3. Then ceil(2/3)=ceil(0.66)=1. Then we can use one card: 2. Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=3, x=2? Then ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. Then two cards: 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T=4, x=3: ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. Then two cards: 3+1=4. Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=5, x=3: ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. Then two cards: 3+2=5. Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=6, x=3: ceil(6/3)=2. Then two cards: 3+3=6. Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=7, x=3: ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3. Then three cards: 3+3+1=7. Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=8, x=3: ceil(8/3)=ceil(2.66)=3. Then three cards: 3+3+2=8. Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=9, x=3: ceil(9/3)=3. Then three cards: 3+3+3=9. Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=10, x=3: ceil(10/3)=ceil(3.33)=4. Then four cards: 3+3+3+1=10. Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=11, x=3: ceil(11/3)=ceil(3.66)=4. Then four cards: 3+3+3+2=11. Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=12, x=3: ceil(12/3)=4. Then four cards: 3+3+3+3=12. Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=13, x=3: ceil(13/3)=ceil(4.33)=5. Then five cards: 3+3+3+3+1=13. Correct.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nHowever, wait: what if T is negative? Let T=-3, x=2. Then ceil(|T|/x)=ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. Then two cards: -2 and -1 (sum=-3). Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=-4, x=3: ceil(4/3)=2. Then two cards: -3 and -1 (sum=-4). Correct.\n\nBut wait: what if T=-5, x=3: ceil(5/3)=2? Then two cards: maximum negative is -3 and -3 -> total -6, which is less than -5. But wait, we can form -5 with two cards: -3 and -2. So that's correct.\n\nBut note: the condition is that k*x >= |T| (for absolute value). For T=-5, |T|=5, and 2*3=6>=5 -> so two cards are enough.\n\nBut wait: the formula ceil(|T|/x) is the minimal k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\nYes, because if we use k cards, the maximum absolute value we can form (if we use the same sign) is k*x. So we require k*x>=|T|.\n\nTherefore, the minimal k is ceil(|T|/x).\n\nBut wait: what if T=0? Then we don't need any card.\n\nSo the code:\n\n  import math\n  import sys\n\n  data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n  n = int(data[0])\n  x = int(data[1])\n  cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n\n  s = sum(cards)\n  T = -s\n\n  if T == 0:\n      print(0)\n  else:\n      k = math.ceil(abs(T) / x)\n      print(int(k))\n\nBut wait: let me run the provided examples.\n\nExample 1: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n  n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> s = -1+1+2=2, T=-2, abs(T)=2, ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1 -> output 1. Correct.\n\nExample 2: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n  n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, T=4, ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> output 2. Correct.\n\nBut wait, wait: the example input format is two integers in the first line and then the list of n integers.\n\nHowever, note: the input example is given as two strings in an array, but in the problem statement, the input is:\n\n  First line: two integers (n and x)\n  Second line: n integers.\n\nBut our code reads the entire input and splits. Then the first two tokens are n and x, and the next n tokens are the cards.\n\nBut wait: what if n=0? Then the second line would be empty? But n>=1.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut wait: one more edge: what if T is negative and very large? \n\n  T = -1000000, x=1 -> k=ceil(1000000/1)=1000000.\n\nBut n is at most 1000, and x is at least 1 and at most 1000, and the numbers are at most 1000 in absolute value, so the total sum S is at most 1000*1000=1000000 (if all are 1000) and at least -1000000. Then T is at most 1000000 (in absolute value). Then k=ceil(1000000/1)=1000000, which is acceptable? The problem says n<=1000, but T can be up to 1000000, and x=1, so k up to 1000000. \n\nBut the problem constraints say n from 1 to 1000 and x from 1 to 1000. So the absolute value of the numbers is at most 1000, so the total sum is at most 1000*1000=1000000 (if n=1000, each 1000). So T can be up to 1000000 (if the sum is -1000000). Then k=ceil(1000000/x). Since x>=1, k can be up to 1000000 (if x=1). \n\nBut 1000000 is a big number, but the problem says n<=1000, so the total sum is at most 1000000, and we are computing ceil(1000000/x). \n\nBut note: the problem says the cards are from -x to x, and x<=1000, so the maximum absolute value of a card is 1000. Then the total sum is at most 1000*1000=1000000, so T is at most 1000000 (in absolute value). \n\nBut the problem does not specify that the total",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards equals zero. The initial set of cards consists of infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be zero after adding some number of cards from the infinite set. The solution involves calculating the current sum of the found cards and then determining how many additional cards are needed to balance this sum to zero.\n2. **Insight**: The target sum required from the additional cards is the negation of the current sum of the found cards. The minimal number of cards needed is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of this target sum divided by the maximum absolute value of the card numbers (x). This is because each card can contribute at most ±x towards the target sum.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Calculating the total sum of the found cards.\n   - If the total sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - Otherwise, compute the absolute value of the target sum (the negative of the current sum) and divide it by x, taking the ceiling of the result to get the minimal number of cards required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    T = -total_sum\n    \n    if T == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = math.ceil(abs(T) / x)\n        print(int(k))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by a list of n integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum T is the negation of this sum, which represents the sum needed from the additional cards to make the total sum zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the target sum T is zero, it means the current sum of the found cards is already zero, so no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Card Count Calculation**: If T is non-zero, the minimal number of cards required is the ceiling of the absolute value of T divided by x. This is because each card can contribute up to x (in absolute value) towards the target sum, and the ceiling ensures we cover the entire target sum with the fewest cards.\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed as the computed minimal number of cards.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and ceiling division to determine the minimal number of cards needed.",
