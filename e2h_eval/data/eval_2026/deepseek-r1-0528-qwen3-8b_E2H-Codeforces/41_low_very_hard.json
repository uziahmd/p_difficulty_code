There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m and then m lines of restrictions [l_i, r_i, x_i]\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming or try to assign heights satisfying all constraints.\n\n However, note: the profit function is a^2 for each house. The goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\n The challenge is that the restrictions impose that in some intervals the maximum height is bounded by x_i.\n\n Observation:\n Since the constraints are independent and the objective is separable (each house's profit depends only on its own height),\n we might think of assigning each house a height that satisfies all the restrictions that cover that house.\n\n But note: the restrictions are on intervals and they require that the maximum height in the interval is <= x_i.\n This means for a house i, its height must be <= the minimum x_i from all restrictions that cover house i.\n\n However, wait: is that sufficient? Consider two overlapping restrictions. Actually, if we let for each house i, \n the maximum allowed height by any restriction that includes i is the minimum x_i over all restrictions covering i, then we can set the height to that value?\n\n But note: it might not be necessary to set the house to the minimum of the restrictions because we have to satisfy all restrictions.\n\n However, for house i, if there is a restriction j that covers house i with x_j, then the house i cannot exceed x_j. Therefore, the maximum height for house i is the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover house i, but also we cannot exceed h.\n\n But wait: what if we set a house to a lower value than the minimum restriction? That might break an adjacent restriction? No, because the restrictions only require that the tallest house in the interval is <= x_i. However, if we set a house too low, then we don't get maximum profit. But note that having a house too high might break a restriction.\n\n Actually, the condition for house i is: it must be <= every x_j for which the restriction j covers i. So the maximum allowed for house i is min{ h, (min_{j: [l_j, r_j] covers i} x_j) }? \n\n However, consider: a restriction might not cover the entire street. But note: we are allowed to set the house to any value between 0 and the minimum allowed (which we just defined). And the profit function is increasing with the square, so we would want to set the house as high as possible.\n\n But wait: is that really independent? What if one restriction forces a house to be low, but then an adjacent house is forced by a different restriction to be high, and then the overall restriction (if they form a contiguous interval) might require that the entire interval has a maximum at most the minimum of the restrictions? \n\n However, note: the restrictions are independent per interval. But the catch is that the same house might be constrained by multiple restrictions. \n\n Let me restate: For each house i, we define:\n   allowed[i] = min( h, min_{for each restriction j that covers house i} x_j )\n\n Then, if we set house i to allowed[i], then we satisfy all restrictions that cover house i. \n\n But is that safe? Consider two restrictions that overlap but with different x's. Then the house i is set to the minimum x of the restrictions that cover it. Now, consider a restriction j that requires that the maximum in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j. Since every house in [l_j, r_j] is set to at most the minimum x of the restrictions covering that house, and note that x_j is one of the restrictions (so the minimum x for a house in [l_j, r_j] is at most x_j), then the maximum in [l_j, r_j] will be at most the minimum x in the entire set of restrictions that cover [l_j, r_j]? \n\n However, wait: the minimum x for a house in [l_j, r_j] might be less than x_j, but then the entire interval [l_j, r_j] has houses at most (min_x) which is <= x_j. So the restriction is satisfied.\n\n Therefore, we can set each house i to allowed[i] (the minimum of the restrictions covering i and h) and then the profit is the sum of squares.\n\n But wait: is this optimal? Because we are setting each house to the maximum allowed by the restrictions (so we get the maximum profit from each house independently). However, note: sometimes we might set a house lower than allowed to help satisfy an adjacent restriction? \n\n Actually, no: because the restrictions are only about the maximum in the interval. Setting a house lower than the allowed value doesn't break the restrictions and doesn't help the adjacent restrictions (because the maximum in an interval is determined by the tallest house). \n\n However, consider: what if we set a house to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The key challenge is ensuring that all zoning restrictions are satisfied, which impose constraints on the maximum height of houses in specific intervals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves assigning heights to houses such that each house's height does not exceed the minimum allowed height derived from all relevant zoning restrictions covering that house. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of these heights.\n2. **Insight**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive zoning restriction that includes it. This is found by taking the minimum of all `x_i` values from restrictions covering the house, but not exceeding the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Preprocessing**: For each house, compute the minimum `x_i` from all restrictions that cover it. This gives the maximum height allowed for that house.\n   - **Profit Calculation**: For each house, set its height to the computed maximum (to maximize profit since the square function is increasing) and sum the squares of these heights to get the total profit.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach involves iterating over each house and each restriction to determine the minimum `x_i`, resulting in a time complexity of O(n*m), where `n` is the number of houses and `m` is the number of restrictions. Given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50), this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    restrictions = []\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x_val = int(data[index+2])\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x_val))\n        index += 3\n        \n    allowed_heights = [h] * n\n    \n    for l, r, x_val in restrictions:\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < allowed_heights[i]:\n                allowed_heights[i] = x_val\n                \n    profit = 0\n    for height in allowed_heights:\n        profit += height * height\n        \n    print(profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of houses `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`. The restrictions are stored as tuples of `(l, r, x_val)`.\n2. **Determining Allowed Heights**: For each restriction, iterate over the affected houses (from `l` to `r`) and update the maximum allowed height for each house to the minimum value encountered across all restrictions covering it. This ensures all restrictions are satisfied.\n3. **Calculating Profit**: For each house, the profit contribution is the square of its allowed height. Summing these values gives the total maximum profit achievable under the given constraints.\n4. **Output**: The total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal heights for each house by leveraging the constraints and ensures maximum profit while adhering to all zoning restrictions.",
