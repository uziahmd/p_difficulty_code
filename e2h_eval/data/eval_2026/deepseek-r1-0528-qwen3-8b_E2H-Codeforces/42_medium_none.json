Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given n and a list of n integers (file sizes)\n We need to find all integers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) such that there exists a moment when:\n   - The first progress bar (current file) shows p% (i.e., floor(100 * x / a_i) = p for some byte x in the current file)\n   - The second progress bar (total data copied so far) shows p% (i.e., floor(100 * (sum of previous files + x) / total_sum) = p)\n\n However, note: we have multiple files. The process goes file by file.\n\n Let:\n   total_sum = sum(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)\n\n For a given file i (0-indexed) with size a_i, and during the copying of that file, we are at byte x (0 <= x <= a_i).\n\n Then:\n   Condition 1: floor(100 * x / a_i) = p\n   Condition 2: floor(100 * (S_prev + x) / total_sum) = p\n\n where S_prev = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_{i-1}\n\n But note: the condition must hold at the same moment (same x in the same file).\n\n Alternatively, we can think: For a fixed p (from 0 to 100), we need to check if there exists a file index i and an integer x (0<=x<=a_i) such that:\n\n   p <= (100 * x / a_i) < p+1   =>   x >= ceil(p * a_i / 100) and x < (p+1)*a_i/100 + 1? Actually, we use floor:\n\n   Actually: floor(100*x/a_i) = p  <=>  p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n        =>  x >= ceil((p * a_i) / 100)   [but careful: because of integer division and floor, we can express as:]\n\n   More precisely: \n        p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n        =>  (p * a_i) / 100 <= x < ((p+1)*a_i)/100\n\n   However, since x must be an integer, we can write:\n\n        x_min = ceil((p * a_i) / 100)   but wait: actually the condition is:\n\n        p * a_i <= 100*x < (p+1)*a_i\n\n        So x must satisfy: ceil((p * a_i) / 100) <= x < (p+1)*a_i/100\n\n   But note: we are working with integers and floor rounding. Actually, the condition is:\n\n        p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n\n        =>  x >= (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [if we use integer ceiling?] OR we can use:\n\n        The smallest integer x such that 100*x >= p*a_i is: x_min = ceil(p*a_i/100) if p*a_i is not divisible by 100?\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n        x_min = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [ceiling division for nonnegative numbers] but wait: \n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n          low_bound = (p * a_i) / 100.0\n          high_bound = ((p+1) * a_i) / 100.0\n\n        Then x must be an integer in [ceil(low_bound), floor(high_bound - 1e-9)]? Actually, the condition is strict inequality: 100*x < (p+1)*a_i.\n\n        But note: because of integer x, we can set:\n\n          x_min = ceil(low_bound) = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [if we are using integer arithmetic]\n\n        However, let me test:\n\n          p=0: then x_min = ceil(0) = 0 -> correct.\n\n          p=1: then x_min = ceil(a_i/100). For example, if a_i=100, then ceil(1) = 1 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: the condition for p=0: x>=0 and x < a_i/100. Since x is integer, if a_i>=1 then x can be 0, but if a_i=0 then ... but a_i>=1.\n\n        However, note: the condition for p=0: we require that 0 <= 100*x/a_i < 1 -> x < a_i/100. Since x is integer, then x=0 is always valid (unless a_i=0, but a_i>=1).\n\n        Now for the second condition:\n\n          floor(100*(S_prev+x)/total_sum) = p\n\n          => p <= 100*(S_prev+x)/total_sum < p+1\n\n          => (p * total_sum) <= 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*total_sum\n\n          => (p * total_sum - 100*S_prev) <= 100*x < (p+1)*total_sum - 100*S_prev\n\n        So for a fixed file i and fixed p, we need an integer x such that:\n\n          x_min1 = ceil( max(0, (p * a_i)) / 100 )   [but wait, we have two conditions]\n\n        Actually, we can combine:\n\n          Condition 1: x >= ceil(p * a_i / 100)   [but note: if p*a_i is integer, then ceil(p*a_i/100) = (p*a_i)//100? Not exactly: ceil(3.0)=3, but (3//1)=3?]\n\n        Let's reframe without floating point:\n\n          Condition 1: 100*x >= p*a_i and 100*x < (p+1)*a_i.\n\n          Condition 2: 100*(S_prev+x) >= p*total_sum and 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*total_sum.\n\n        So we can solve for x in:\n\n          x >= ceil(p*a_i/100)   -> x >= (p*a_i + 99)//100   [because ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b for positive integers? Actually, for positive integers: ceil(a/100) = (a+99)//100]\n\n          and x <= floor(((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100)   [because 100*x < (p+1)*a_i => x < (p+1)*a_i/100 => x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) ]\n\n        Similarly, condition 2:\n\n          x >= ceil((p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) / 100)   but note: (p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) might be negative, then x>=0 is the lower bound.\n\n          Actually, we can write:\n\n          Condition 2: 100*(S_prev+x) >= p*total_sum  => x >= ceil((p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) / 100)   but if (p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) is negative, then x>=0 (which we already have) is the condition.\n\n        However, we can also write condition 2 as:\n\n          x >= max(0, ceil((p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) / 100))   [but note: if p*total_sum < 100*S_prev, then x>=0 is the only constraint from condition2?]\n\n        Actually, condition2: \n          100*(S_prev+x) >= p*total_sum   => x >= ceil((p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) / 100)   if (p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) > 0, otherwise no lower bound from condition2 (since x>=0).\n\n        But wait: if (p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) is negative, then the inequality holds for all x (because S_prev+x is at least S_prev, and 100*S_prev >= p*total_sum? Actually, no: the condition is 100*(S_prev+x) >= p*total_sum, which is automatically satisfied if 100*S_prev >= p*total_sum, but if not, then we need x to be at least ...). Actually, we must consider the entire range.\n\n        Alternatively, we can express condition2 without ceiling:\n\n          x >= ceil( (p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) / 100 )\n\n        But note: the left side must be an integer. And if (p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) is negative, then the ceil will be negative, and then x>=ceil(negative) is automatically satisfied by x>=0 (since x is nonnegative). So we can set:\n\n          x_lower_bound_condition1 = (p * a_i + 99) // 100   [if we use integer ceiling: (n + 99)//100 is the ceiling of n/100 for nonnegative n? Actually, yes, because if n is divisible by 100, then (n+99)//100 = (k*100+99)//100 = k + (99)//100 = k. But wait: ceil(k*100/100)=k, and (k*100+99)//100 = k + (99)//100 -> no, wait: (k*100+99)//100 = k + (99)//100 -> but 99//100 is 0, so it is k. That's correct. If n is not divisible, say n=k*100+r (0<r<100), then (k*100+r+99)//100 = k + (r+99)//100. Since r+99 is between 99 and 198, then (r+99)//100 is either 0 (if r<1) or 1 (if r>=1). Actually, if r>=1, then (r+99)//100 = (r+99)//100, which is 1 if r+99>=100, i.e., if r>=1? Actually, for r=1: (1+99)=100 -> 100//100=1, so then k+1. But wait: we want ceil(n/100) = k+ceil(r/100). Since r in [1,99], ceil(r/100)=1. So then (n+99)//100 = k*100//100 + (r+99)//100 = k + (r+99)//100, and (r+99)//100 is 1 for any r>=1, so that gives k+1 which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the formula for ceiling of n/100 is: (n + 99) // 100.\n\n        Similarly, condition2:\n\n          We require 100*(S_prev+x) >= p*total_sum  => x >= ceil((p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) / 100)\n\n        But if (p*total_sum - 100*S_prev) is negative, then ceil((p*total_sum - 100*S_prev)/100) is negative, so we take x>=0 (the natural lower bound). So we can define:\n\n          x_lower_bound_condition2 = (p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev + 99) // 100   [if we use integer ceiling]?\n\n        However, note: the condition is 100*(S_prev+x) >= p*total_sum, so:\n\n          x >= (p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev) / 100\n\n        Then the smallest integer x satisfying that is:\n\n          x_min2 = ceil((p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev) / 100)   if (p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev) is positive, but if negative, then 0 is enough.\n\n        But note: we can use:\n\n          x_min2 = max(0, (p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev + 99) // 100)   [if (p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev) is negative, then (p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev + 99) // 100 will be negative, so we take 0]\n\n        However, wait: the expression (p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev + 99) // 100 is the ceiling of (p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev) / 100? \n\n        Example: let A = p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev, then we want ceil(A/100). But if A is negative, then ceil(A/100) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to A/100 (which is negative). However, our x cannot be negative, so we take max(0, ceil(A/100)).\n\n        But note: if A is negative, then ceil(A/100) is negative, so max(0, ceil(A/100)) = 0.\n\n        Similarly, for the upper bounds:\n\n          Condition1: x < (p+1)*a_i/100   => x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)   -> in integer terms, x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100) - 1 if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100? Actually, we can use:\n\n          Condition1: x <= (p+1)*a_i // 100   [if we use integer floor, but wait: 100*x < (p+1)*a_i => x < (p+1)*a_i/100, so x_max1 = floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*a_i // 100   if (p+1)*a_i is not divisible by 100? Actually, no: \n\n          Example: (p+1)*a_i = 200, then x < 200/100 -> x < 2, so x<=1. Then floor(200/100) = 2, but we need 1. So we should use: floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) is the same as (p+1)*a_i // 100 if (p+1)*a_i is not divisible by 100? Actually, no: because 200//100 is 2, but we need 1. So we must use:\n\n          x_max1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100   if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0 then we can use that, but wait: \n\n          Actually, the condition is x < (p+1)*a_i/100. The maximum integer x is floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - epsilon) which is (p+1)*a_i//100 if (p+1)*a_i is not divisible by 100? No, because:\n\n          If (p+1)*a_i = 200, then 200/100=2, then x must be <2, so x<=1. But 200//100=2, which is too high.\n\n        How to get the floor of (p+1)*a_i/100 - epsilon? \n\n          x_max1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100   would give 2 for 200, but we need 1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          x_max1 = (p+1)*a_i - 1 // 100   ? That doesn't work.\n\n        Actually, the condition is: 100*x < (p+1)*a_i, so x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*a_i // 100   if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0, but if divisible, then we subtract one? \n\n        But note: integer division in Python: for positive numbers, (p+1)*a_i // 100 is the floor of (p+1)*a_i/100.\n\n        Then if (p+1)*a_i is divisible by 100, then floor((p+1)*a_i/100) = (p+1)*a_i/100, but the condition requires strictly less, so we must have x <= (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          x_max1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100   if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0 then this is the maximum, else (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          x_max1 = (p+1)*a_i - 1 // 100   -> no, that is (p+1)*a_i-1 // 100.\n\n        Or:\n\n          x_max1 = (p+1)*a_i - 1 // 100   is not the same.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n          x_max1 = (p+1)*a_i - 1\n          Then x_max1 // 100   ?\n\n        But note: we don't need the exact integer boundaries if we are going to iterate over x in the file? \n\n        However, note: the problem constraints: n<=100, and each a_i<=1000, so the total_sum <= 100*1000 = 100000, and p from 0 to 100. We cannot iterate over all p (101 values) and for each p iterate over all files (100) and then over the x in the file (which could be up to 1000) -> worst-case 101 * 100 * 1000 = 10,100,000 which is acceptable in Python.\n\n        But wait: we are asked to output the numbers from 0 to 100 that satisfy the condition. We can try to iterate p from 0 to 100, and for each p, iterate over the files and check if there exists an x in [0, a_i] that satisfies both conditions.\n\n        However, we can avoid iterating over x by checking the intervals for x. But note: the two conditions must be satisfied simultaneously.\n\n        Steps for a fixed p and file i (with size a_i, and previous sum S_prev):\n\n          Condition1: x must be in [L1, R1] where:\n            L1 = ceil(p * a_i / 100) = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n            R1 = floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*a_i - 1 // 100   [this is not straightforward]\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the interval for condition1:\n\n          x must be in [L1, min(R1, a_i)] and also satisfy condition2.\n\n        But note: condition2 depends on S_prev and total_sum.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Condition2: x must be in [L2, R2] where:\n            L2 = ceil((p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev) / 100)   [if negative, then 0]\n            R2 = floor(((p+1)*total_sum - 100*(S_prev+a_i)) / 100) ??? Wait, no.\n\n        Actually, condition2 is: floor(100*(S_prev+x)/total_sum) = p\n\n          <=> p <= 100*(S_prev+x)/total_sum < p+1\n\n          => 100*(S_prev+x) >= p * total_sum   and 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*total_sum\n\n          => x >= ceil((p * total_sum - 100*S_prev) / 100)   [if positive, else 0] and x <= floor(((p+1)*total_sum - 100*S_prev - 1) / 100)   [because 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*total_sum => x < ((p+1)*total_sum - 100*S_prev)/100]\n\n        So for condition2, the x must be in [L2, R2] where:\n\n          L2 = max(0, (p * total_sum - 100*S_prev + 99) // 100)   [ceiling for positive, but if negative then 0]\n          R2 = ((p+1)*total_sum - 100*S_prev - 1) // 100   [because x must be integer and 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*total_sum => x <= floor(((p+1)*total_sum - 100*S_prev - 1) / 100) ]\n\n        But wait: condition2 does not have an upper bound from the file's own size? Actually, x is bounded by [0, a_i] (the current file's size). However, we are considering the current file, so x is from 0 to a_i.\n\n        Therefore, for a fixed file i and p, we need an integer x such that:\n\n          x in [max(L1, L2), min(R1, R2, a_i)]\n\n        And the interval [max(L1, L2), min(R1, R2, a_i)] must be non-empty.\n\n        However, note: condition1 already restricts x to [L1, R1] (with R1 being the maximum allowed by condition1, and condition2 restricts to [L2, R2] (and we must also have x<=a_i). So we can set:\n\n          low_bound = max(L1, L2, 0)   [but L1 and L2 are computed from nonnegative, so 0 is already considered in L2? Actually, we set L2 to be at least 0, and L1 is at least 0 (since p>=0, a_i>=1)]\n\n          high_bound = min(R1, R2, a_i)\n\n        Then if low_bound <= high_bound and there exists an integer x in [low_bound, high_bound] (which there will be if the interval is non-empty) then p is achieved.\n\n        But note: we must also ensure that the conditions are met. However, note that:\n\n          Condition1: x must be in [L1, R1] (because L1 = ceil(p*a_i/100) and R1 = floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) [but wait: condition1 says 100*x < (p+1)*a_i, so R1 = (p+1)*a_i - 1 // 100? Actually, we can compute R1 as:\n\n          R1 = (p+1)*a_i - 1 // 100   -> no, that is not correct.\n\n        Let me clarify for condition1: \n\n          Condition1: p <= 100*x/a_i < p+1\n\n          => x in [ceil(p*a_i/100), floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9)]\n\n        How to compute R1? \n\n          We know that x must be an integer and 100*x < (p+1)*a_i.\n\n          So the maximum x is: floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*a_i // 100   if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0, but if divisible, then we need to subtract one? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n          R1 = (p+1)*a_i // 100   # This gives the floor of (p+1)*a_i/100.\n\n        But then, if (p+1)*a_i % 100 == 0, then the condition 100*x < (p+1)*a_i forces x <= (p+1)*a_i//100 - 1.\n\n        However, note: if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0, then the floor of (p+1)*a_i/100 is the largest integer x0 such that 100*x0 <= (p+1)*a_i - 1? No, the floor is the largest integer x0 such that x0 <= (p+1)*a_i/100.\n\n        And the condition is 100*x < (p+1)*a_i, so x < (p+1)*a_i/100, so x <= floor((p+1)*a_i/100 - 1e-9) = (p+1)*a_i//100 if (p+1)*a_i % 100 != 0? Actually, no: \n\n          Example: (p+1)*a_i = 101, then 101//100 = 1, and 100*x < 101 -> x<=1, which is the same as 101//100=1. But if (p+1)*a_i=100, then 100*x < 100 -> x<=0.99... -> x<=0. But 100//100=1, so we must subtract one.\n\n        So we can compute:\n\n          R1 = (p+1)*a_i - 1\n          Then R1 // 100   ? \n\n        But wait, that is: (p+1)*a_i - 1 // 100, which is the same as (p+1)*a_i//100 if (p+1)*a_i is not divisible by 100? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n          R1 = (p+1)*a_i - 1\n          Then the condition is x <= R1 // 100? \n\n        No, because the condition is 100*x < (p+1)*a_i, which is equivalent to x <= floor((p+1)*a_i - 1)/100? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n          R1 = ((p+1)*a_i - 1) // 100\n\n        Why? Because we want the largest integer x such that 100*x <= (p+1)*a_i - 1.\n\n        Then the condition 100*x < (p+1)*a_i is equivalent to 100*x <= (p+1)*a_i - 1, because (p+1)*a_i is an integer.\n\n        So:\n\n          Condition1: x in [ (p*a_i+99)//100 , ((p+1)*a_i-1)//100 ]\n\n        Similarly, condition2: \n\n          Condition2: 100*(S_prev+x) >= p * total_sum and 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*total_sum\n\n          => 100*(S_prev+x) >= p * total_sum   => x >= ceil((p * total_sum - 100*S_prev) / 100)   [if positive, else 0]\n\n          => 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*total_sum   => x <= floor( ((p+1)*total_sum - 100*S_prev - 1) / 100 )   [because 100*(S_prev+x) <= (p+1)*total_sum - 1]\n\n        So:\n\n          L2 = max(0, (p * total_sum - 100*S_prev + 99) // 100)\n          R2 = ((p+1)*total_sum - 100*S_prev - 1) // 100\n\n        Then, for the current file i, we require an integer x such that:\n\n          x_low = max(L1, L2)\n          x_high = min(R1, R2, a_i)\n\n          and x_low <= x_high.\n\n        However, note: the entire x must be within [0, a_i] (so we have R1 and R2 might be larger than a_i, so we take min(R1, R2, a_i)).\n\n        But wait: condition1 already ensures that x is at most a_i (because the file has a_i bytes, and x is the number of bytes copied so far in this file). However, condition2 might require x beyond a_i? Actually, no: the total progress bar is for the entire process, and we are in the middle of file i, so the total copied is S_prev+x, and x cannot exceed a_i (since we haven't copied beyond the current file). So the condition2 must also consider that x<=a_i.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          For each p from 0 to 100:\n            For each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n              S_prev = sum of the first i files (if i==0, then S_prev=0)\n              total_sum = sum(all files)\n\n              L1 = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n              R1 = ((p+1)*a_i - 1) // 100\n\n              L2 = max(0, (p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev + 99) // 100)\n              R2 = ((p+1)*total_sum - 100 * S_prev - 1) // 100\n\n              # Also, the x must be at most a_i (for the current file)\n              low_bound = max(L1, L2)\n              high_bound = min(R1, R2, a_i)\n\n              If low_bound <= high_bound, then p is achieved in file i at some x.\n\n          Then we mark p as found.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the second progress bar uses the total_sum and the current file's progress. Also, note that the total_sum is fixed, and S_prev is the sum of the previous files.\n\n        But wait: what about the fact that we are in the middle of the file? The total data copied is S_prev+x, and the total_sum is the entire data. The condition2 is independent of the current file's size? It only depends on S_prev (the previous files) and the total_sum.\n\n        However, note: we must also consider that the current file is being copied, so the total data copied is S_prev+x, and x is from 0 to a_i.\n\n        But note: the condition2 does not care about the current file's size, only the total. However, we must ensure that the total data copied (S_prev+x) is at most total_sum, and we are only copying up to a_i in the current file, so S_prev+x <= S_prev+a_i <= total_sum (because the next files are not included yet). So it's safe.\n\n        However, we must note: the condition2 is defined for the entire process, so even if we are in the middle of the current file, the total data copied is S_prev+x, and the total is total_sum.\n\n        There is one more issue: the condition2 must be satisfied for the same x that satisfies condition1. And we are checking for the same x.\n\n        But note: the above method for condition2 uses the entire total_sum and the entire S_prev (which is the sum of the previous files). This is correct.\n\n        However, what if the same p is achieved in different files? Then we mark p as found.\n\n        But note: the problem asks for all p from 0 to 100 for which there exists at least one moment (any file, any x) that satisfies both conditions.\n\n        We can break out of the inner loop (over files) once we found one file for a given p.\n\n        But wait: we are iterating over p from 0 to 100, and for each p we iterate over all files. We can break the inner loop as soon as we find one file that satisfies the condition for p.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the condition for a given p might be satisfied in multiple files, but we only need one.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Read n\n          Read list a of n integers.\n\n          total_sum = sum(a)\n\n          found_p = [False]*101   # indices 0 to 100\n\n          For p from 0 to 100:\n            For i from 0 to n-1:\n                S_prev = sum(a[0:i])   # if i==0, then 0\n                a_i = a[i]\n\n                # Condition1: current file\n                # Compute L1 and R1 for condition1 (for the current file)\n                L1 = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n                R1 = ((p+1) * a_i - 1) // 100\n\n                # Condition2: total progress\n                # We require: 100*(S_prev+x) >= p * total_sum and 100*(S_prev+x) < (p+1)*total_sum\n                # Then, x must be at least L2 and at most R2 (as defined above)\n\n                # Compute L2 and R2 for condition2\n                # First, compute the required x for condition2: \n                #   Lower bound: ceil((p * total_sum - 100*S_prev) / 100) if positive, else 0.\n                #   Upper bound: floor(( (p+1)*total_sum - 100*S_prev - 1) / 100)\n\n                # But note: the condition2 requires that the total data (S_prev+x) is at least ... and less than ...\n\n                # However, we must also consider that x must be in [0, a_i] (the current file) but condition1 already gives [L1, R1] which is within [0, a_i] (since x is the number of bytes in the current file, and condition1 ensures x is at most ((p+1)*a_i-1)//100, which is <= a_i).\n\n                # Now, for condition2, the lower bound L2: \n                #   If (p * total_sum - 100*S_prev) <= 0, then any x>=0 is okay (so L2=0).

Yes, because ceil(-0.05)=0.\n\n                # But wait:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all integers from 0 to 100 such that there exists a moment during the copying of files where both the current file's progress bar and the overall progress bar display the same percentage. The progress bars are updated after each byte is copied, and their values are floor-rounded to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves checking for each percentage `p` (from 0 to 100) whether there exists a file and a byte position within that file such that both the current file's progress and the total progress bars show `p`. The current file's progress is calculated as `floor(100 * x / a_i)`, where `x` is the number of bytes copied in the current file `i` (of size `a_i`). The total progress is `floor(100 * (sum of previous files' sizes + x) / total_sum)`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all file sizes.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each file and each possible percentage `p`, we can compute the range of bytes `x` in the current file that would make the current file's progress bar show `p`. Similarly, we can compute the range of bytes `x` that would make the total progress bar show `p`. The intersection of these two ranges must be non-empty for `p` to be valid.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Iterate over each percentage `p` from 0 to 100.\n   - For each file, calculate the lower and upper bounds (`L1`, `R1`) for `x` such that the current file's progress is `p`.\n   - Calculate the lower and upper bounds (`L2`, `R2`) for `x` such that the total progress is `p`.\n   - Check if there exists an `x` that lies within the intersection of `[L1, R1]` and `[L2, R2]` and also within the bounds of the current file's size `[0, a_i]`.\n   - If such an `x` exists, mark `p` as valid.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves iterating over 101 possible percentages and up to 100 files, with each iteration performing constant-time arithmetic operations. Thus, the time complexity is O(101 * n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(a_list)\n    found = [False] * 101\n    \n    for p in range(101):\n        for i in range(n):\n            S_prev = sum(a_list[:i])\n            a_i = a_list[i]\n            \n            L1 = (p * a_i + 99) // 100\n            R1 = ((p + 1) * a_i - 1) // 100\n            \n            num = p * total_sum - 100 * S_prev\n            L2 = (num + 99) // 100\n            if L2 < 0:\n                L2 = 0\n            else:\n                L2 = (num + 99) // 100\n            \n            R2 = ((p + 1) * total_sum - 100 * S_prev - 1) // 100\n            \n            low_bound = max(L1, L2)\n            high_bound = min(R1, R2, a_i)\n            \n            if low_bound <= high_bound:\n                found[p] = True\n                break\n        \n    result = []\n    for p in range(101):\n        if found[p]:\n            result.append(str(p))\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files `n` and their respective sizes.\n2. **Initialization**: The total sum of all file sizes is computed, and a boolean array `found` is initialized to keep track of valid percentages.\n3. **Iterating Over Percentages**: For each percentage `p` from 0 to 100, the algorithm checks each file to see if there exists a byte position `x` that satisfies both the current file's and total progress conditions.\n4. **Bounds Calculation**: For each file, the algorithm calculates the valid ranges for `x` (denoted as `L1`, `R1` for the current file and `L2`, `R2` for the total progress).\n5. **Intersection Check**: The algorithm checks if the intersection of the ranges `[L1, R1]` and `[L2, R2]` (within the file's size limit) is non-empty. If it is, `p` is marked as valid.\n6. **Output**: Finally, all valid percentages are printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible percentages by leveraging arithmetic bounds and ensures correctness by verifying the intersection of conditions for each file and percentage.",
