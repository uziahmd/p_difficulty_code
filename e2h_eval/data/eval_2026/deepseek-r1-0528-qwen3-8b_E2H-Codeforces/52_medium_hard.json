Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of used candles needed to make a new one)\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a used candle.\n   - We can take 'b' used candles and convert them into one new candle (which can then be burned).\n\n How it works:\n   Let total_hours = 0\n   Let current_candles = a\n   Let leftover = 0   (this will be the used candles that we don't immediately convert)\n\n However, note that we burn candles and they become used. We can think:\n\n   Step 1: Burn all available candles (current_candles). Then we get current_candles used candles.\n   Then, we can form new_candles = current_candles // b\n   Then, the leftover used candles is current_candles % b.\n\n   But then we also have the new_candles that we just made, so we can burn them too, and then we'll have more used ones.\n\n   However, note: after burning the new_candles, we get additional new_candles (from the burning) and then we can combine with the leftover.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simulate:\n\n   hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   while candles > 0:\n        hours += candles   # because we burn all current candles for an hour each\n        # Now we have 'candles' used candles from burning\n        new_candles = candles // b\n        leftover = candles % b\n        candles = new_candles + leftover   # leftover from previous burning plus the new ones we made\n\n   But wait, in the example: \"4 2\"\n        Start: candles=4 -> hours=4\n        Then, 4//2 = 2, 4%2=0 -> candles becomes 2+0 = 2\n        Then, hours=4+2=6\n        Then, 2//2=1, 2%2=0 -> candles becomes 1\n        Then, hours=6+1=7\n        Then, 1//2=0, so stop.\n\n   This gives 7, which matches.\n\n   But let's try the second sample: \"6 3\"\n        Start: candles=6 -> hours=6\n        Then, 6//3=2, 6%3=0 -> candles=2\n        Then, hours=6+2=8\n        Then, 2//3=0 -> stop.\n\n   So output is 8.\n\n   However, note that the problem says: \n        Input: ['4 2', '6 3'] -> Output: ['7', '8']\n\n   So the simulation above works.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints are small (a,b between 1 and 1000). The worst-case scenario is when b=2 and a=1000, which would require about log_b(a) iterations? Actually, we are reducing the number of candles by roughly factor (b-1)/b each time, so the loop will run at most O(log_base_b(a)) which is very safe.\n\n   However, we can also solve without a loop by using a formula, but the iterative solution is straightforward.\n\n   But note: the above simulation does not account for the fact that when we burn the new_candles, we are effectively burning them and then they become used. However, the way we are doing it is correct because:\n\n        In each iteration, we use all the candles (both the original and the newly made) for burning. Then we recalculate the next set of candles from the used ones.\n\n   However, there is an alternative way: we can consider that every time we burn a candle, we get one hour and one used candle. But we can combine 'b' used candles to make one new candle, which then provides one more hour and one more used candle. Essentially, we are getting an extra candle for every b used candles.\n\n   Another way to look at it: total hours = a + floor((a-1)/(b-1))   ? Let me check with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: a=4, b=2 -> 4 + floor(3/1) = 4+3=7 -> correct.\n   Example 2: a=6, b=3 -> 6 + floor(5/2)=6+2=8 -> correct.\n\n   Why is this?\n\n   Explanation: Initially, we use a candles (so a hours). Then, we have a used candles. We can form a//b new candles, but note that each new candle is made from b used candles and gives one hour. However, the process can be repeated until we don't have enough used candles (less than b) to make a new one.\n\n   The total number of candles we can get from the used ones is essentially: we start with a used candles, and every time we use b used candles to make one new candle, which then becomes one more used candle (after burning). So effectively, for every b-1 used candles we can get one additional hour (because if you have b used candles, you can make one new candle that burns for one hour and then becomes one used candle, so net gain of one hour per b used candles? Not exactly, but note: \n\n   Think of the entire process as: \n        We have a initial candles. After burning, we have a used candles. Then we can form a//b new candles, and we are left with a % b used candles.\n\n   But then we burn the new candles and get a//b more used candles, and then we can form (a//b)//b new candles, etc.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of the entire cycle: \n\n        Total hours = a + floor((a) / (b-1))   [But wait, if we do that for example1: 4 + floor(4/1)=8, which is too big]\n\n   Actually, the known trick for such problems is: \n\n        total = a\n        while a >= b:\n            new_candles = a // b\n            remainder = a % b\n            total += new_candles\n            a = new_candles + remainder\n\n        But that is the same as the iterative simulation.\n\n   However, the formula I thought was: total = a + (a-1)//(b-1)   [for example1: (4-1)//(2-1)=3//1=3, so total=7; example2: (6-1)//(3-1)=5//2=2, total=8] is correct.\n\n   Why does the formula work?\n\n   Consider: Each candle initially gives 1 hour. Additionally, each time we have b-1 used candles, we can actually \"recycle\" to get one more candle. Because:\n\n        To make one candle, we need b used candles. But when we burn that candle, we get one used candle back. So effectively, we are spending b-1 used candles to get one additional hour.\n\n        Therefore, the total number of hours is the initial a plus the number of times we can form groups of b-1 used candles from the entire set of used candles (which are a plus all the new ones we get from burning).\n\n        However, note that we start with a used candles (from the first burning), and then we can use them to make more. The total number of used candles we can accumulate is essentially a plus the new ones we make, but we don't need to store all, we just need to know how many times we can form a new candle.\n\n        The formula is: total = a + (a-1)//(b-1)\n\n   But why subtract one? Let me see:\n\n        We can form new candles from used ones. Each new candle requires b used candles and gives one used candle (from burning). So if we start with x used candles, we can form x//b new candles, and then we have x % b + x//b (from burning the new ones) used candles. But the total number of hours is the initial a plus the new candles we made.\n\n        Alternatively, we can model the entire process as: \n\n            total_candles = a\n            total_used = a   (from burning the initial a)\n            cycles = 0\n            while total_used >= b:\n                new_candles = total_used // b\n                total_candles += new_candles\n                total_used = total_used % b + new_candles   # because the new_candles will burn and become used\n\n            Then total_hours = a + ... but wait, we are counting the initial a and then the new ones.\n\n        Actually, the iterative simulation we did earlier is the same as:\n\n            hours = 0\n            candles = a\n            while candles:\n                hours += candles\n                # Now we have 'candles' used candles\n                candles = candles // b + candles % b\n\n        And that is equivalent to:\n\n            hours = a + (a//b) + ((a//b) + (a % b))//b + ... \n\n        But the formula (a-1)//(b-1) is a known trick for these kinds of recycling problems.\n\n   Let me derive the formula:\n\n        Let T = total hours.\n\n        We know that the process stops when we have fewer than b used candles.\n\n        Each candle (whether initial or recycled) gives 1 hour and 1 used candle.\n\n        However, the entire system: the total number of used candles generated is T (because each hour produces one used candle). But we started with a, and then we made some new candles from the used ones.\n\n        The total number of candles we ever had (and hence burned) is T, but we only started with a. The rest came from recycling.\n\n        How many times did we recycle? Each recycling requires b used candles to make one candle, and then we burn that candle and get one used candle back. So effectively, each recycling cycle (from making one candle) consumes b-1 used candles (because we get one back).\n\n        Therefore, the total number of used candles we must have is T, and they are broken down into:\n            Initial used candles: a\n            Plus the used candles from burning the recycled candles.\n\n        But note: the recycled candles are made from the used candles. Let R be the number of recycled candles. Then:\n\n            R = floor((a + (burned from recycled) ) / b)   ??? \n\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n\n            Each hour gives one used candle, so total used candles = T.\n\n            We started with a, and we need to have enough used candles to make R candles, but note that the used candles we get from burning the recycled candles are part of the total.\n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            T = a + R   (because we burn a + R candles)\n\n            Also, the number of recycled candles R is limited by the total used candles we have, which is T, and we can only make floor(T / b) candles? But wait, that doesn't hold because we use the used candles as we go.\n\n        Another known approach is to consider that the entire process is:\n\n            T = a + floor((a) / (b-1))\n\n        But wait, in the example: a=4, b=2 -> T=4+floor(4/1)=8 -> which is not 7.\n\n        Actually, the correct formula is:\n\n            T = a + floor((a-1) / (b-1))\n\n        Why? Because we are going to have one candle left at the end that cannot be converted (if we have a remainder). \n\n        Explanation: \n\n            We start with a candles. We burn them and get a used candles. Then we can make floor(a/b) new candles, and then we have a % b used candles left.\n\n            Then we burn the new candles and get floor(a/b) more used candles, so now we have (a % b) + floor(a/b) used candles.\n\n            Then we can make floor( (a % b + floor(a/b)) / b ) new candles, and so on.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider that each time we burn a candle, we get one used candle. The total number of candles we can burn is the initial a plus the number of times we can form a full group of b from the used candles.\n\n            But note: the last candle we burn might not be able to form a full group. However, the entire process can be seen as:\n\n                We have a initial candles. Then, we can burn up to (a + k) candles, where k is the number of recycled candles.\n\n                The total used candles we have is (a + k). And the number of recycled candles k is the number of candles we made from the used ones, which is floor((a + k) / b) ?\n\n            Actually, the equation is: \n\n                k = floor((a + k) / b)\n\n            But that is recursive and not linear.\n\n        However, the formula T = a + floor((a-1)/(b-1)) is known from similar problems (like the \"Candle\" problem on CodeForces). \n\n        Let me test with another example: a=10, b=5\n\n            Simulation:\n                Start: 10 -> hours=10\n                Then: 10//5=2, 10%5=0 -> 2 candles\n                Then: 2//5=0 -> done. Total hours=10+2=12.\n\n            Formula: 10 + (10-1)//(5-1) = 10 + 9//4 = 10+2=12 -> correct.\n\n        Another example: a=1, b=2\n            Hours: 1 -> then we have 1 used candle, which is less than 2 -> total=1.\n            Formula: 1 + (0)//1 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        Example: a=3, b=2\n            Simulation:\n                Start: 3 -> hours=3\n                Then: 3//2=1, 3%2=1 -> candles=1+1=2\n                Then: 2//2=1, 2%2=0 -> candles=1\n                Then: 1//2=0 -> done. Total=3+1+1=5.\n\n            Formula: 3 + (3-1)//(2-1)=3+2//1=5 -> correct.\n\n        Example: a=2, b=2\n            Simulation:\n                Start: 2 -> hours=2\n                Then: 2//2=1, 2%2=0 -> candles=1\n                Then: 1//2=0 -> done. Total=2+1=3.\n            Formula: 2 + (2-1)//(2-1)=2+1//1=3 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n   So we can write:\n\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        if b == 1:\n            # Then we can make infinite candles? But the problem states b>=2, so we don't need to handle b==1.\n            # But the constraint says b>=2, so we can ignore.\n            print(a * (b-1) + 1)   # Actually, if b==1, then we can make a new candle from 1 used candle, so we never run out.\n            # However, the problem says b>=2, so we skip.\n        else:\n            print(a + (a-1)//(b-1))\n\n   However, note that the formula (a-1)//(b-1) is integer floor division.\n\n   But wait, what if a=0? Then (a-1) is negative. But the input constraint says a>=1.\n\n   Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        print(a + (a-1)//(b-1))\n\n   Let me test with a=1, b=2: (1-1)//(2-1)=0//1=0 -> 1+0=1 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, why is the formula (a-1)//(b-1) and not (a)//(b-1)? \n\n   The reason is that the entire process uses the initial a and then we can only use the used candles (which are a) to make floor(a/(b-1)) additional candles? \n\n   Actually, the derivation is:\n\n        We start with a candles. We burn them and get a used candles. Then, we can use these a used candles to make floor(a/b) new candles, and then we have a % b used candles left.\n\n        Then we burn the new candles and get floor(a/b) used candles, so now we have (a % b) + floor(a/b) used candles.\n\n        Then we can make floor((a % b + floor(a/b))/b) new candles, etc.\n\n        But note: the total number of candles we burn is the initial a plus the sum of all the new candles we make.\n\n        The key observation is that the entire process is limited by the fact that we can use b-1 used candles to produce one candle (because we get one back). \n\n        The total number of candles we can burn is the initial a plus the total number of candles we can create from the used candles. And the used candles are produced at a rate of one per candle burned, so we have T used candles (if we burn T candles). \n\n        However, we only need to have enough used candles to make the next set. The condition is that we can only make a candle if we have at least b used candles. And then we get one used candle back from burning that candle.\n\n        The total number of candles we can burn is therefore:\n\n            T = a + floor((a) / (b-1))\n\n        But wait, in the example a=4, b=2: 4 + floor(4/1)=8, which is not 7.\n\n        Alternatively, consider that the last candle we burn might not be recyclable. \n\n        Actually, the known solution for the \"New Year Candles\" problem (which is a classic) is:\n\n            hours = 0\n            candles = a\n            while candles >= b:\n                hours += candles\n                new_candles = candles // b\n                candles = candles % b + new_candles\n            hours += candles   # add the remaining candles that we couldn't convert\n\n        But wait, that is not the same as our simulation. In our simulation, we were adding the current candles (which are burned) and then updating the candles for the next round.\n\n        However, the above while loop does:\n\n            For a=4, b=2:\n                First iteration: candles=4 -> hours=4, new_candles=2, candles=0+2=2.\n                Second iteration: candles=2 -> hours=4+2=6, new_candles=1, candles=0+1=1.\n                Then break, and then add the remaining 1 -> hours=7.\n\n        So we can also do:\n\n            total = 0\n            candles = a\n            while True:\n                total += candles\n                if candles < b:\n                    break\n                new_candles = candles // b\n                remainder = candles % b\n                candles = new_candles + remainder\n\n        But wait, that breaks the process because after burning the candles, we update and then the next set of candles is the ones we can burn. However, in the above code, we add the current candles and then update. But in the example, we added 4 and then 2 and then 1, which is correct.\n\n        However, note that the above while loop does not account for the last set of candles (the ones that are less than b) because after the last burning we haven't updated the candle count for the next round (but we break). But then we don't burn the leftover? Actually, no: in the simulation we are burning all the candles we have at the beginning of the iteration, and then we update the candle count for the next round (which includes the leftovers and the new ones). Then we break when the candle count is less than b.\n\n        But wait, the above while loop doesn't burn the leftover candles (the ones that are less than b) in the next round. Actually, we do: in the while condition we check if candles < b, then we break and then we don't add them again. But in the simulation, we do:\n\n            In the last step, we have 1 candle (which is less than b=2) so we break, and we have already added the 1 in the previous iteration? \n\n        Actually, no: look at the example:\n\n            First iteration: candles=4 -> we add 4, then update to 2.\n            Second iteration: candles=2 -> we add 2, then update to 1.\n            Then we break because 1<2.\n\n        Then we don't add the 1 again.\n\n        But wait, we did add the 2 and then the 1 is left, but we don't burn the 1. However, the problem is: the 1 is a candle we have, and we can burn it (it gives one hour) and then it becomes a used candle. But we don't have enough to make a new one (since b=2). So we should burn that 1 and then we have 1 used candle (which is not enough to make a new candle). \n\n        However, the simulation we did earlier:\n\n            Step0: candles=4 -> burn 4: hours=4, then we have 4 used -> make 2 new, so candles=2.\n            Step1: burn 2: hours=6, then we have 2 used -> make 1 new, so candles=1.\n            Step2: burn 1: hours=7, then we have 1 used -> stop.\n\n        So we did burn the 1.\n\n        But in the while loop above, we break without burning the 1.\n\n        Correction: the while loop above does not account for the last set of candles (the 1) because we break at the condition. But the problem is that the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop. We burn the candles at the beginning of the loop, and then update. Then we check if the updated candles are less than b. But note: the updated candles are the ones we have for the next round. However, we want to burn the current set of candles (which we did) and then we have the updated candles (which we don't burn in the same iteration). \n\n        Actually, the above while loop is:\n\n            total = 0\n            candles = a\n            while True:\n                total += candles   # burn all current candles\n                if candles < b:\n                    break\n                # Then we update the candles for the next round: we take the used candles from the ones we just burned (which is 'candles') and form new ones.\n                new_candles = candles // b\n                remainder = candles % b\n                candles = new_candles + remainder\n\n        This misses the last set of candles that are less than b. Because we break without burning them.\n\n        Actually, we did burn them: the 'total += candles' happens, and then we break. But wait, we don't update the candles to include the used ones from the last burning? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n\n            In the simulation, we burn the candles and then we get used candles (which is the same number as the candles we burned). Then we convert as many as possible (groups of b) to new candles. \n\n        But in the above while loop, we are not converting the entire set of used candles (we are, because the used candles are the same as the candles we burned, and we update the candles for the next round). However, the last set (when we break) is the candles we burned (which we did) and then we don't convert because we break. But note: the conversion happens only if we have at least b candles to burn. \n\n        However, the last set of candles (the ones we burn) is the candles we have at the beginning of the iteration. Then we update the candles for the next round, but we don't burn them again in the same iteration. \n\n        But the problem: we burn the current candles and then we update the candles (meaning we have new candles for the next round). Then the next round we burn those new candles. \n\n        However, the above while loop does not account for the possibility that we might have leftover candles (used ones) from the last burning that we don't convert? \n\n        Actually, the update step (converting) is done after burning and before the next round. So the leftover from the last burning is included in the next round's candles. \n\n        But wait, the condition is: if the current candles (before burning) are less than b, we break. But we just burned the current candles and then we break. However, we did burn the current candles (the ones that are less than b) and then we break. Then we don't update the candles for the next round (because we break). \n\n        However, in the simulation we did above, we burned the 1 candle (the last one) and then we updated the candles to 1 (because 1//2=0, so remainder=1). But the update step is done only if we don't break? \n\n        Actually, the update step is done only if we don't break. So in the example:\n\n            First iteration: candles=4 -> burn 4, update to 2, then continue because 2>=2.\n            Second iteration: candles=2 -> burn 2, update to 1, then continue because 1<2? No, we break.\n\n        But wait, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop. However, the update step is done and then the condition is checked for the next iteration. \n\n        Actually, the code structure:\n\n            while True:\n                total += candles   # burn the current candles\n                if candles < b:\n                    break\n                # Then update the candles for the next round\n\n        This means: after burning the current candles, if the current candles (the ones we just burned) are less than b, we break. But note: the current candles we burned are the ones we had at the beginning of the iteration. Then we break without updating. \n\n        However, the update step is necessary to get the new candles for the next round. \n\n        But the condition is: we break when the current candles (the ones we are about to burn) are less than b. Then we don't update. \n\n        But the update step is done only if we are going to have a next round. \n\n        This is incorrect because we update the candles for the next round only after burning, and then we check if we can burn again. \n\n        The correct simulation is:\n\n            We burn the current candles and then we update the candles (from the used ones) for the next round. Then we check if the next round's candles are at least b? Actually, no: we check the current candles (which are the ones we just updated) for the next round? \n\n        Let me restructure the simulation:\n\n            total = 0\n            candles = a\n            while candles >= b:\n                # Burn all candles: each candle gives one hour\n                total += candles\n                # Now, we have 'candles' used candles. We can convert them into new candles.\n                new_candles = candles // b\n                remainder = candles % b\n                candles = new_candles + remainder\n            # After the loop, we still have some candles (less than b) that we can burn one last time?\n            total += candles\n\n        But wait, in the example:\n\n            a=4, b=2:\n            First iteration: candles=4>=2 -> total=4, new_candles=2, remainder=0 -> candles=2\n            Then, candles=2>=2 -> total=4+2=6, new_candles=1, remainder=0 -> candles=1\n            Then, loop ends because 1<2. Then we do total +=1 -> 7.\n\n        That is correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            total = 0\n            candles = a\n            while candles > 0:\n                total += candles\n                if candles < b:\n                    break\n                # Then update for the next round: but wait, we break if candles < b, so we don't update?\n                # Actually, we break after adding the candles if they are less than b. But we still need to update even if we break? \n\n            Actually, the update step is necessary to get the next set of candles. \n\n        But note: the update step is independent of the burning. The burning step is just adding the candles to total. The update step is: from the used candles (which is the same as the candles we burned) we make new ones.\n\n        However, the above code breaks after burning the current set (if the current set is less than b) and then we don't update. But the update step is done only if we are going to have a next round? \n\n        Actually, the update step is done only if we are going to have a next round? \n\n        The correct simulation is:\n\n            total = 0\n            candles = a\n            while candles >= b:\n                total += candles\n                # Convert the used candles (which is candles) into new ones\n                candles = candles // b + candles % b\n            # Then, we have the leftover candles (if any) that are less than b, which we can burn one last time?\n            total += candles\n\n        But wait, that would burn the leftover candles and then we don't have any to update? \n\n        Let me test with a=4, b=2:\n\n            First iteration: candles=4>=2 -> total=4, candles = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2+0=2.\n            Second iteration: candles=2>=2 -> total=4+2=6, candles=2//2+2%2=1+0=1.\n            Then, the loop condition fails (1<2) and then we add 1 -> total=7.\n\n        But wait, the update step is inside the loop and we break the loop when candles < b. Then we add the leftover. \n\n        However, note: in the update step, we are not burning the new candles again. The update step is just converting the used candles (from the current burning) into new candles. Then the next iteration we burn the new candles.\n\n        But the problem is: the update step converts the used candles from the last burning (which is the same as the candles we burned) into new candles. Then the next set of candles is the new ones. \n\n        This is the same as the iterative simulation we did initially.\n\n        However, the problem with the while condition is that we break when the current candles (at the beginning of the iteration) are less than b. Then we burn the current candles (which are less than b) and then we break. But wait, we break without updating? \n\n        Actually, we break the loop and then we burn the leftover (the current candles) and then we don't update because we break. \n\n        But the update step is done only during the loop body. \n\n        Alternatively, we can burn the leftover at the end.\n\n        But the above code does:\n\n            total = 0\n            candles = a\n            while candles >= b:\n                total += candles\n                candles = candles // b + candles % b\n            total += candles\n\n        This is simpler.\n\n        However, we can also do:\n\n            total = 0\n            candles = a\n            while candles >= b:\n                # Burn all the current candles\n                total += candles\n                # Recycle the used candles\n                candles = candles // b + candles % b\n            # Burn the leftover\n            total += candles\n\n        This is clear.\n\n        Now, which method to choose? The formula is one-liner: a + (a-1)//(b-1)\n\n        Since the problem constraints are small, both methods are acceptable.\n\n        However, the formula is more efficient (no loop) and we can use it.\n\n        But note: the formula (a-1)//(b-1) is valid because:\n\n            We are essentially counting the total number of candles we can burn, which is the initial a plus the number of times we can form a new candle (each new candle requires b-1 used candles from the entire process). \n\n        But why (a-1)? \n\n        Explanation of the formula:\n\n            We start with a candles. We burn them and get a used candles. Then we can form floor(a/b) new candles, which requires a//b * b used candles, leaving a % b.\n\n            Then we burn the new candles and get floor(a/b) used candles, so now we have (a % b) + floor(a/b) used candles.\n\n            The total candles burned so far is a + floor(a/b).\n\n            The total used candles is a + floor(a/b).\n\n            Now, we can form floor((a + floor(a/b))/b) new candles.\n\n            However, the entire process continues until we have fewer than b used candles.\n\n            The total number of candles burned is the initial a plus the sum of all the new candles we made.\n\n            The new candles we made are floor(a/b) + floor((a//b + a % b)/b) + ...\n\n            But note: the total used candles is T (the total burned). And we can only form floor(T / b) new candles? \n\n            Actually, the total new candles is floor(T / b) - 1? No.\n\n            Alternatively, the entire process is: \n\n                T = a + floor((a + floor(a/b)) / b) + floor((a + floor(a/b) + floor((a + floor(a/b))/b)) / b) + ...\n\n            But that is recursive.\n\n        Known fact: \n\n            The formula T = a + (a-1)//(b-1) is derived from the idea that the entire process can be represented as:\n\n                T = a + floor((a + floor(a/b) + floor(floor(a/b)/b) + ...) / (b-1))\n\n            Actually, there's a simpler way: \n\n            Consider that each candle we burn produces one used candle, and we need b used candles to make a new candle (which then produces one used candle). So effectively, we are spending b-1 used candles to get one extra candle. \n\n            Therefore, the total number of candles we can burn is a + floor((a-1)/(b-1)).\n\n        Why a-1? \n\n            Because we start with a candles, and we can use the used candles from the initial a to make more. But note that the last candle we burn might leave one used candle that isn't enough to make a new one. \n\n            The total number of candles we burn is the initial a plus the number of times we can form a full group of b-1 used candles from the entire used candles (which are T). But wait, that would lead to:\n\n                T = a + floor((T) / (b-1))   [but that is circular]\n\n        Actually, the known solution for the problem \"Candles\" (or similar) is:\n\n            T = a + (a-1)//(b-1)\n\n        And we've tested with several examples.\n\n        Therefore, I choose the formula.\n\n        Code:\n\n            a, b = map(int, input().split())\n            print(a + (a-1)//(b-1))\n\n   However, let me test with a=10, b=5: 10 + (10-1)//(5-1)=10+9//4=10+2=12 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, the simulation with a=10, b=5:\n\n        Start: 10 -> hours=10\n        Then: 10//5=2, 10%5=0 -> 2\n        Then: 2//5=0 -> done. Total=10+2=12.\n\n        So the formula matches.\n\n   Conclusion: we use the formula.\n\n   However, note that the formula (a-1)//(b-1) is integer floor division.\n\n   One more test: a=1, b=2 -> (0)//1=0 -> 1.\n\n   a=2, b=2 -> (1)//1=1 -> 3.\n\n   a=3, b=2 -> (2)//1=2 -> 5.\n\n   All correct.\n\n   But wait, what if b=1? The problem states b>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        print(a + (a-1)//(b-1))\n\n   However, note that the formula (a-1)//(b-1) is defined for a>=1 and b>=2.\n\n   But what if a=0? The input constraint says a>=1.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   But wait, let me check the problem statement: \"Vasily has a candles.\" and \"When Vasily lights up a new candle, ...\" and a>=1.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        result = a + (a-1)//(b-1)\n        print(result)\n\n   However, wait: the example in the problem is:\n\n        Input: \"4 2\" -> Output: \"7\"\n\n        Our formula: 4 + (4-1)//(2-1) = 4 + 3//1 = 7 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, I just realized: the formula is sometimes written as (a + b - 1) // b for ceiling division, but here we have floor division.\n\n   This is a different problem.\n\n   But our derivation and tests match.\n\n   I think we are ready.\n\n   However, note that the problem says the input is two integers in a single line.\n\n   Example input: \"4 2\", so we read two integers.\n\n   Code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            # but the problem says there is one line with two integers\n            # so we assume there are two\n            pass\n        a = int(data[0])\n        b = int(data[1])\n\n        print(a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a used candle. Vasily can then recycle `b` used candles to create a new one. The challenge is to calculate how many hours he can enjoy the light by burning as many candles as possible, including those created through recycling.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Burn**: Vasily starts with `a` candles, which he burns for `a` hours. After burning, he has `a` used candles.\n2. **Recycling**: For every `b` used candles, Vasily can create one new candle. Each new candle can be burned again, adding more hours to the total.\n3. **Mathematical Insight**: The total number of candles that can be burned is not just the initial `a` but also includes those created through recycling. The formula `a + (a - 1) // (b - 1)` efficiently calculates this by considering that each recycling process requires `b - 1` used candles (since one used candle is returned after burning the new candle). This formula accounts for all possible recycles until fewer than `b` used candles remain.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    result = a + (a - 1) // (b - 1)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of used candles needed to create a new one).\n- **Formula Application**: The formula `a + (a - 1) // (b - 1)` calculates the total hours by:\n  - Adding the initial `a` candles (each burns for one hour).\n  - Using integer division to determine how many additional candles can be created and burned through recycling. The term `(a - 1) // (b - 1)` effectively counts the number of times `b - 1` used candles can be combined to form new candles, considering that the last incomplete set of `b` candles does not contribute to an additional burn.\n- **Output**: The result is printed, which is the total hours Vasily can light his room.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging mathematical insight to avoid unnecessary loops, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
