Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S (in Morse code). Note: The entire string S is built by appending one character (either '0' or '1') at a time.\n\n Important facts:\n  - Each Morse code for a letter is a string of length 1 to 4, containing only '0' and '1'. \n  - There are 30 possible strings of length 1 to 4 (since 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30), but 4 of them are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n  - Therefore, there are 26 valid letters.\n\n However, note: We are not mapping the entire alphabet arbitrarily. The problem states that each string of length 1 to 4 (from the set of 30) corresponds to a distinct English letter except the four forbidden ones.\n\n But note: The same Morse code string might appear in multiple places? And we are to count distinct sequences of letters (so if the same letter appears multiple times, we count it once? Actually, wait: the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\". \n\n However, the example: \n   Input: 3\n           1\n           1\n           1\n   Output: 1, 3, 7\n\n After building \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", the valid substrings (that are valid Morse codes) are:\n\n   In \"1\": \n        \"1\" -> valid (T)\n\n   Then, we have two letters: T and M (because \"11\" is M) and also \"1\" again (but we already have T). But note: the example lists the sequences: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\n However, note that the example output after 3 modifications is 7.\n\n The key is: We are counting distinct sequences of letters (each sequence being a string of one or more letters). But note: The same Morse code substring (i.e., same sequence of bits) might represent the same letter, so we don't want duplicate letters? Actually, no: because the same letter is always represented by the same Morse code. So each distinct Morse code (if valid) gives a distinct letter.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"sequences of English letters\", meaning that we are counting words (composed of the alphabet of the 26 letters). However, the example counts:\n\n   T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT.\n\n This is 7 distinct words.\n\n How do we relate this to the substrings?\n\n Observation: We are allowed to take any contiguous substring of S, and then break that substring into valid Morse code representations (each of length 1 to 4) such that the entire substring is partitioned into consecutive valid Morse codes. However, note the problem says \"represented with some substring\" — meaning that the entire substring must be exactly one representation of a letter? Or multiple?\n\n Let's read the problem statement: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\"\n\n Example: In the first sample, the substring \"11\" is broken into two ways? Actually, no: the substring \"11\" can only be broken as one letter (since the first letter is \"1\" (which is T) and then the next \"1\" is another T? But wait: the example includes \"TT\" (which is two T's). \n\n However, note: the example does not say that we break the substring arbitrarily. It says \"represented with some substring\". So the substring must be the exact Morse code for a sequence of letters.\n\n But note: the Morse code representation of a sequence of letters is the concatenation of the Morse codes for each letter. And each letter's code has length between 1 and 4. Therefore, a substring of S must be decomposed into contiguous segments, each segment being a valid Morse code (and the entire substring must be decomposed without leftover).\n\n However, the problem does not require that we break the substring arbitrarily. Actually, we are allowed to take any substring (contiguous part) of S and interpret it as a sequence of letters (by splitting it into valid Morse code tokens). But note: the same substring might be split in different ways? Then we would get different sequences.\n\n But wait: the example output counts 7 for \"111\". The example lists: \n   \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n How do these correspond to substrings of \"111\"?\n\n   T: substring \"1\"\n   M: substring \"11\"\n   O: substring \"111\"\n   TT: substring \"11\" (the first two ones) OR the last two ones? Actually, the substring \"11\" appears three times: \n        positions [0:2] -> \"11\" -> M (but wait, we already counted M as one word). However, note: the example also lists \"TT\", which is two T's. So how do we get TT? \n        We cannot break \"11\" as two T's because the first T uses the first '1', and the second T uses the second '1'. But then the substring \"11\" is broken as two T's. \n\n So the same substring \"11\" can be interpreted in two ways: \n        as one letter (M) or as two letters (T followed by T).\n\n Similarly, \"111\" can be broken as:\n        One letter: O (if we take the whole thing as one letter, but note: the letter O is represented by \"111\", so that's valid)\n        Or as three T's: \"1\",\"1\",\"1\"\n        Or as a T and an M: \"1\" and \"11\" (but then the substring would be the first two and the last one, but wait: the substring must be contiguous and the entire substring must be broken without gaps. For \"111\", we can break at the first position: \"1\" and \"11\", giving \"TM\"; or at the second position: \"11\" and \"1\", giving \"MT\".\n\n Therefore, the substring \"111\" can be broken in multiple ways.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". \n\n So we are to consider every contiguous substring of S (at every starting and ending point) and for each contiguous substring, we consider all ways to break it into valid Morse code tokens (each token is one of the 26 letters, i.e., a string of length 1 to 4 that is not one of the forbidden ones). Then, we count the distinct sequences (words) of letters that appear.\n\n But wait: the same word (sequence of letters) might appear from multiple substrings? For example, the word \"TT\" can appear from the substring \"11\" (the first two characters) and from the substring \"11\" (the last two characters) in the case of \"1111\". However, in our example \"111\", the substring \"11\" only appears twice? Actually, the string \"111\" has two contiguous substrings of length 2: \n        substring from index0 to index1: \"11\"\n        substring from index1 to index2: \"11\"\n\n So two occurrences of the substring \"11\", but both break into \"TT\". However, note: the problem says \"distinct sequences\", so we count the word \"TT\" only once.\n\n Therefore, we are counting distinct words (each word is a string of one or more letters) that can be obtained from any contiguous substring of S by breaking it into valid Morse code tokens (each token being one of the 26 letters). \n\n How to approach?\n\n Since m (the total length) is up to 3000, we cannot iterate over all contiguous substrings (which would be O(n^2)) and then for each substring do a DP on the breaking (which could be O(n)) because that would be O(n^3) and 3000^3 is 27e9 which is too slow.\n\n We need a linear or near-linear solution.\n\n Alternative idea: use a trie or automaton for the valid Morse code strings (of lengths 1 to 4) and then use dynamic programming to count the distinct words that appear as a decomposition of contiguous substrings.\n\n However, note: we are not counting the decompositions per se, but the distinct words (sequences of letters) that appear. And the same word (sequence of letters) can be formed by multiple decompositions, but we only count it once.\n\n Also, note: the same word can be formed by different contiguous substrings? But the word is defined by the sequence of letters. For example, the word \"TT\" is just two T's. But note: the Morse code for T is \"1\", so the word \"TT\" is represented by the bits \"11\". So if we have the substring \"11\", we can form the word \"TT\". But if we have another substring \"11\" (say from a different part of S) then we can form the same word \"TT\". However, the problem says \"distinct sequences\", so we don't want duplicates.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid counting the same word multiple times.\n\n But note: the same word (sequence of letters) is uniquely determined by the sequence of letters. And the same sequence of letters will always be represented by the same concatenation of their Morse codes. Therefore, if the same sequence of letters appears from two different substrings, we count it only once.\n\n However, we must be cautious: two different sequences of letters (words) might result in the same concatenation of Morse codes? For example, if two different words have the same total bits? But the Morse codes for the letters are fixed, so the same concatenation of bits must correspond to the same sequence of letters (because the breaking is forced by the fact that each letter's code is of fixed length? Actually, no: the breaking is not forced because we don't know the boundaries. \n\n Actually, the problem does not specify the boundaries. So the same concatenation of bits might be broken in multiple ways (as we saw with \"11\" being broken as one letter or two). But note: we are counting the distinct sequences of letters (the words) that can be represented by some substring. So if a substring breaks into a sequence of letters, then we count that word. \n\n However, the same word (sequence of letters) might be formed by two different decompositions? For example, consider the word \"TT\": its representation is \"11\". Now, if we have a substring \"11\", we break it as two T's. But note: the word \"M\" is represented by \"11\", so if we break the same substring \"11\" as one M, then we get a different word (M) than if we break it as two T's (TT). So the same substring can yield two different words.\n\n But the problem: we are to count the distinct words (each word is a string of letters) that appear from any substring, regardless of how many ways to break.\n\n Now, the challenge: we cannot iterate over every substring (O(n^2)) and then do a DP for breaking (O(n)) because n=3000 and that would be 4.5e6 * 3000 operations which is 13.5e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\n We need to use a smarter way.\n\n Another idea: use a finite automaton that recognizes valid Morse code tokens (for lengths 1 to 4). Then, we can use a DP that goes over the string and collects all words that end at the current position. But we also must account for the fact that the same word (sequence of letters) might appear from different parts.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a state machine that, for each position, stores the set of words (or rather, the set of sequences of letters) that end at that position. But storing the entire set of words is too expensive.\n\n Insight: we are only dealing with sequences of letters that are composed of 26 letters. And the length of the word is at most 4 (since the maximum token is 4, and the substring is up to 3000, but the word can be long). However, the distinct words can be very many (exponentially many in the length of the substring). \n\n We need to count distinct words modulo 10^9+7. But note: the problem says \"print them modulo 10^9+7\", meaning we don't have to list the words, just the count.\n\n Another approach: use inclusion-exclusion or generating functions? Or maybe use the idea of \"substring\" and \"Aho-Corasick\" to count distinct words, but the words are built from a fixed alphabet (the 26 letters) and the breaking is constrained by the Morse code.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a DP that goes along the string and for each position, we consider the valid breaks (from the previous i-1, i-2, i-3, i-4 positions) and then combine the words from the previous breaks. But then we have to avoid double-counting the same word.\n\n However, note: the same word (sequence of letters) might appear from multiple starting points. We cannot store all words because there are too many.\n\n Let me think differently: we are to count the distinct words (each word is a string of one or more letters) that can be formed by any contiguous substring of S, by breaking the substring into tokens that are valid Morse codes (each token is one of the 26 letters). \n\n We can use a rolling hash to represent the entire set of words? But the words are sequences of letters, and we have 26 letters. We can map each letter to an integer (0-25) and then represent a word by a base-26 number? But the length of the word can be long and we have many words.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a trie and then use a hashing method to insert all words we form and then report the size of the set. But the total distinct words might be too many (up to exponential in n).\n\n But note: the substring is contiguous and the breaking is constrained by the valid tokens (only 26 tokens). Also, the entire string S is built incrementally.\n\n We are doing m (<=3000) steps. At each step, we add one bit (either '0' or '1') to the string S.\n\n We need to update the set of words (distinct sequences) that we can form from the new S.\n\n How can we update the set of words when adding a new bit?\n\n We can consider that any new word must end at the last bit. Then, we can use a DP that, for each ending position, stores the set of words (as a hash value) that end at that position. But then we have to avoid duplicates across the entire string.\n\n But note: the same word (sequence of letters) can appear from multiple starting positions. We are only interested in the distinct words overall.\n\n Steps:\n\n  Let dp[i] be a set of words (represented as tuples or as integers) that end at position i.\n\n  Then, we can break the substring ending at i by trying to match tokens (valid Morse codes) of length 1,2,3,4 that end at i.\n\n  However, the problem: the same word might appear from different breaks, but we want to count distinct words.\n\n  But note: the word is determined by the sequence of letters. The same word (same sequence) will always have the same representation in Morse code? Actually, yes: because the Morse code for a letter is fixed. However, the same word (same sequence of letters) must have the same total bits. But wait: the same word (sequence of letters) is represented by the concatenation of their fixed codes. Therefore, the same word will always have the same bit string. \n\n  However, consider: two different words can have the same bit string? No, because the breaking is fixed by the tokenization. But note: the same bit string can be broken in multiple ways (as we saw) to form different words. But the word is independent of the bit string? Actually, no: the word is defined by the breaking. \n\n  Example: the bit string \"11\" can be broken as one letter (M) or two letters (T,T). These are two different words.\n\n  But note: the word \"M\" is a single letter and the word \"TT\" is two letters. They are different.\n\n  Therefore, the same bit string can lead to multiple words. But two different bit strings cannot lead to the same word because the word is defined by the sequence of letters, and each letter has a unique bit representation.\n\n  However, wait: two different sequences of letters (words) must have different bit strings (because they are the concatenation of their fixed codes). So the mapping from words to bit strings is unique.\n\n  But then, why did the same bit string \"11\" yield two different words? Because the breaking changes the interpretation. \n\n  Actually, the word is defined by the breaking. So the same bit string can be broken in multiple ways, leading to different words.\n\n  But the problem: we are to count distinct words (the sequences of letters) that appear from any substring. \n\n  Therefore, we can consider: the entire set of words is the set of all sequences of letters (each letter being one of the 26) that can be formed by a contiguous substring of S, where the contiguous substring is broken into tokens (each token is one of the 26 letters) and the breaking must be such that the entire substring is covered.\n\n  Now, we can use a DP that for each position j, we store the set of words (as a tuple of letters) that end at j. But storing the entire word (as a tuple) is too heavy because the words can be long and there are many words.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a rolling hash for the entire word? But then we have to worry about collisions.\n\n  Another idea: we don't care about the actual words, only the count of distinct words. We can use a state machine that traverses the string and at each step, we consider:\n\n      Let F(i) be the set of words (as a hash) that end at position i.\n\n      Then, for each k in [1,4]:\n          Check the substring S[i-k+1:i+1] (if length k) and see if it can be broken into a sequence of tokens (each token is valid and of length 1 to 4) that together form a word. But wait, actually we can break the substring arbitrarily (from left to right) as long as each token is valid. However, note: we are only considering contiguous substrings that end at i.\n\n      But we can use a DP that for each position i, we try to extend from previous breaks. However, the breaking is arbitrary and the same word might be formed by multiple breaks.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use an automaton that, given a string, breaks it into tokens (valid Morse codes) and then we can use the automaton to generate the word (the sequence of letters) for the entire substring. Then, we use a set to record the word. But we cannot store the entire set of words because there are too many.\n\n  We need a way to count distinct words without enumerating them.\n\n  Insight: the problem is similar to counting distinct substrings (in terms of the word they represent) but the word is defined by the breaking. However, note that two different substrings (different bit strings) might yield the same word? Actually, no: because the word is defined by the breaking, and the breaking is defined by the tokenization. But two different bit strings can yield the same word only if they are the same bit string (because the word is defined by the sequence of letters, and the sequence of letters is defined by the breaking). However, wait: two different breakings of the same bit string yield different words. But two different bit strings (even if they have the same length) might yield the same word? \n\n  Example: Consider two different bit strings that are the concatenation of the same sequence of letters? But the Morse code for each letter is fixed, so the concatenation is fixed. Therefore, two different bit strings cannot yield the same word.\n\n  But wait, the word is defined by the breaking, and the breaking must be such that the entire substring is broken into valid tokens. However, the same word is represented by the same bit string (the concatenation of the tokens). Therefore, the same word must come from the same bit string.\n\n  However, note: the same word (sequence of letters) is represented by a unique bit string (the concatenation of the fixed codes). Therefore, if we have two different substrings (bit strings) that are the same, then they yield the same set of breakings (if we break the same bit string, we get the same set of words). But if we have two different substrings (bit strings) that are different, they yield different words.\n\n  Actually, the word is defined by the breaking, and the breaking produces a word (a sequence of letters) that is uniquely determined by the bit string and the breaking. But two different breakings of the same bit string yield two different words. \n\n  However, the same word (sequence of letters) must be produced by the same bit string (because the mapping from word to bit string is fixed). Therefore, if we have two different bit strings, they cannot produce the same word.\n\n  But wait: consider the word \"T\" is \"1\", and the word \"M\" is \"11\". Now, if we have the bit string \"1\", we can form the word \"T\". If we have the bit string \"11\", we can form the words \"M\" and \"TT\". \n\n  Now, the word \"TT\" is two T's, and the word \"M\" is one M. These are different.\n\n  Therefore, the distinct words are in one-to-one correspondence with the distinct bit strings that are the concatenation of valid tokens (with no leftover) and that are broken in at least one valid way? But note: the same bit string can be broken in multiple ways, yielding multiple words, but each word is unique (because the word is defined by the breaking).\n\n  However, we are to count the distinct words (sequences of letters) that appear. And the same word (sequence of letters) cannot appear from two different bit strings, because the word is defined by the breaking and the breaking produces a word that is the concatenation of the letters. And the mapping from a word (sequence of letters) to its bit representation is fixed (the concatenation of the fixed codes for each letter).\n\n  Therefore, we can say: a word is uniquely identified by its bit representation (because the bit representation is the concatenation of the fixed codes for the letters). But wait: the same word (sequence of letters) has a fixed bit representation. \n\n  However, note: the breaking of a substring produces a word and a bit string (the entire substring). And the word is the sequence of letters. The same word (sequence of letters) must have the same bit string (the concatenation of the codes). Therefore, two different breakings of the same substring (bit string) produce two different words, and these words are distinct because they are different sequences of letters.\n\n  Therefore, the distinct words are in one-to-one correspondence with the distinct bit strings that are broken into valid tokens (at least one valid breaking) and that are the concatenation of the fixed codes for the letters.\n\n  But note: the breaking must cover the entire substring.\n\n  Now, we can reframe the problem: Count the distinct sequences of letters (words) that can be formed by any contiguous substring of S, provided that the substring can be broken into valid Morse code tokens (each token is one of the 26 letters). \n\n  And since the same word (sequence of letters) corresponds to a unique bit string (the concatenation of the tokens), then we are effectively counting distinct bit strings (that are the concatenation of valid tokens) that appear as contiguous substrings of S, and then each such bit string corresponds to at least one word (the one obtained by the breaking that forms it). However, note: the same bit string can be broken in multiple ways (yielding multiple words) but each word is distinct (because the breaking produces a distinct sequence of letters). \n\n  But wait: the problem is asking for the distinct words (the sequences of letters) that appear. And each distinct word is defined by a distinct bit string (its own fixed bit representation). Therefore, we are counting distinct bit strings that are the concatenation of valid tokens (i.e., the entire bit string is broken into valid tokens) and that appear as contiguous substrings of S.\n\n  However, note: the same bit string might be broken in multiple ways, but that does not matter for the distinctness of the words: each breaking produces a distinct word. But wait, no: the breaking produces the word (the sequence of letters). The same bit string broken in different ways produces different words, and these words are distinct because they are different sequences of letters.\n\n  Therefore, the total distinct words is the union of the words produced by all contiguous substrings (each substring is broken arbitrarily, and each breaking gives a word). \n\n  But note: the same word (sequence of letters) can be produced by two different bit strings? Let me check: \n      Suppose we have two different bit strings A and B, and both A and B break into valid tokens. And the word produced by breaking A is the same as the word produced by breaking B. Is that possible?\n      The word is defined by the sequence of letters. The sequence of letters is determined by the breaking. But the breaking of A produces a sequence of letters, and the breaking of B produces the same sequence of letters. Then, the concatenation of the codes for that sequence of letters must be A and also B. But the mapping from word to bit string is fixed. Therefore, A must equal B.\n\n  Hence, the same word (sequence of letters) can only be produced by one bit string (the one that is the concatenation of the fixed codes for that word).\n\n  Therefore, the distinct words are in one-to-one correspondence with the distinct bit strings that are the concatenation of valid tokens (i.e., the entire bit string can be broken into valid Morse codes) and that appear as contiguous substrings of S.\n\n  However, note: the same bit string (that can be broken in multiple ways) produces multiple words (each breaking is a distinct word). But we are counting distinct words. So we are effectively counting the set of all words (each word is a string of one or more letters) that can be formed by breaking any contiguous substring of S, and the same word is not repeated.\n\n  But note: two different breakings of the same substring (bit string) produce two different words, and these two words are distinct. And these words are also distinct from words produced by other substrings.\n\n  Therefore, the problem reduces to: count the distinct bit strings (that are the concatenation of valid tokens) that appear as contiguous substrings of S, but wait: no, because the same bit string can be broken in multiple ways, and each way gives a distinct word. However, the distinct words are not the same as distinct bit strings. \n\n  Actually, we are not counting distinct bit strings, but distinct words. And the words are defined by the breaking. But the breaking of a bit string produces a word, and the same bit string produces multiple words (if it can be broken in multiple ways). And two different bit strings produce different words (because the words are defined by the breaking and the breaking produces a word that is the sequence of letters, and the sequence of letters is uniquely determined by the bit string and the breaking).\n\n  But wait: the word is defined by the breaking, and the breaking is defined by the bit string. The same bit string broken differently yields different words. However, the word is independent of the bit string? No, the word is determined by the breaking.\n\n  But note: the mapping from breaking to word is injective: two different breakings (on the same or different bit strings) produce different words? Actually, no: consider two different bit strings: \n      Bit string A: \"1\" -> word \"T\"\n      Bit string B: \"11\" -> word \"M\" (if broken as one token) or \"TT\" (if broken as two tokens). \n      The word \"T\" is different from \"M\" and \"TT\".\n\n  Now, consider two different bit strings that are the same: \n      Bit string A: \"1\", broken as one token -> word \"T\"\n      Bit string B: \"1\", broken as one token -> word \"T\"\n      Same word.\n\n  But the same word is produced by the same bit string. \n\n  However, the problem is that the same bit string can be broken in multiple ways, producing multiple words. And we want to count distinct words.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot simply count distinct bit strings. We must count distinct words (sequences of letters) that appear from any contiguous substring.\n\n  Now, how to do that without enumerating all words?\n\n  We can use a DP that, for each position, stores the set of words (as a hash) that end at that position. But the set of words might grow exponentially.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a state machine that, for each position, stores the set of words (as a hash) that end at that position, and then use a global set to avoid duplicates. But the global set might become too large.\n\n  However, note: the total length of S is up to 3000, and each word is a sequence of letters (each letter is one of 26). The maximum length of a word is at most 3000/1 = 3000, but note: the minimum length of a token is 1, so the maximum word length is 3000. But the distinct words might be too many to store.\n\n  We need a smarter way.\n\n  Insight: use a finite automaton that recognizes valid tokens (the 26 valid Morse codes) and then use a DP that for each position i, we store the set of states (in the automaton) that we can be in, and then the word formed is the entire sequence of tokens from the start of the substring to i. But then, we are not storing the entire word, but we can use the automaton to combine with previous states.\n\n  However, we are interested in distinct words, and the words are sequences of letters. Each letter is one of 26. We can use a trie (Aho-Corasick) for the alphabet of letters (26 letters) and then use a DP that for each position i, we store the set of nodes in the trie that are reached by the words ending at i. But the trie would have 26 letters, and the depth is the length of the word.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a DP that stores the last token (the last letter) and the entire history, but that is not feasible.\n\n  Another idea: use a linear algebra approach or generating functions? \n\n  Let's try to think simpler.\n\n  We are only asked for the count modulo 10^9+7.\n\n  We can use the following:\n\n      Let f(i) be the set of words (represented as an integer hash) that end at position i.\n\n      Then, we can update f(i) by trying to match tokens (valid Morse codes) of length 1 to 4 that end at i, and then the word ending at i is the word from the previous part (ending at i-len(token)) plus this token.\n\n      But we have to avoid duplicates.\n\n  However, the total distinct words might be huge, but note: the length of the word is limited by the length of the substring (which is increasing). But m is 3000, and the word length can be up to 3000, so the total distinct words might be exponential.\n\n  But note: the alphabet is fixed (26 letters) and the word is a sequence of letters. The total distinct words is 26^(length) which is astronomical.\n\n  We need to find a way to count without storing the words.\n\n  Let me think about the process:\n\n      We are building S one bit at a time.\n\n      After each modification, we want to know the total distinct words that appear from any contiguous substring of the current S.\n\n      We can use a rolling hash for the entire set of words? Or use a Bloom filter? Not helpful.\n\n  Another idea: use the concept of suffix automata or suffix array to keep track of distinct substrings, but we are not counting distinct substrings, we are counting distinct words (defined by breaking) and the breaking is constrained.\n\n  Wait, here is a key observation: the word is defined by the breaking. And the breaking must use valid tokens. Therefore, the set of words is the set of all sequences of letters (each letter being one of the 26) that appear as a contiguous substring of S, but only if the entire substring is broken into valid tokens. \n\n  But note: the same word (sequence of letters) is defined by its fixed bit string (the concatenation of the tokens). Therefore, the word appears if and only if its fixed bit string appears as a contiguous substring of S.\n\n  However, wait: consider the word \"TT\": its bit string is \"11\". But the substring \"11\" is present, so the word \"TT\" appears. Similarly, the word \"M\" has bit string \"11\", so the substring \"11\" appears, so the word \"M\" appears. But note: the substring \"11\" appears, and we break it in two ways: one way yields \"M\", the other yields \"TT\". So the same bit string yields two different words.\n\n  Therefore, the presence of the bit string \"11\" ensures that both words \"M\" and \"TT\" appear.\n\n  But wait, what if the bit string \"11\" is not present? Then neither \"M\" nor \"TT\" appear.\n\n  Therefore, the set of words is the set of all words (sequences of letters) whose concatenation of Morse codes is a contiguous substring of S.\n\n  However, note: the breaking is not unique for a given bit string. But the word is defined by the breaking. And the same bit string can be broken in multiple ways, but each breaking produces a distinct word. And these words are distinct because they are different sequences of letters.\n\n  But then, the total distinct words is not simply the set of bit strings that appear, but the set of all words (sequences of letters) that have their bit string appearing in S.\n\n  And since the bit string of a word is fixed, then the condition for a word to appear is that its bit string appears as a contiguous substring of S.\n\n  However, wait: consider a word that is broken in only one way. Then its bit string is unique. Consider a word that can be broken in multiple ways? Then its bit string is still unique (because the word is defined by the sequence of letters, and the sequence of letters has a fixed bit string). \n\n  But note: the same word (sequence of letters) has only one bit string. Therefore, the condition for a word to appear is that its bit string appears as a contiguous substring of S.\n\n  Then, the total distinct words is the set of all words (over the 26 letters) whose bit string is a contiguous substring of S.\n\n  But then, we can precompute the set of valid bit strings (all strings of length 1 to 4 that are not the four forbidden ones) and then for each contiguous substring of S, we can check if it is in the set of valid bit strings? But then, we would be counting the words that appear, but note: a word is a sequence of one or more letters, and its bit string is the concatenation of the tokens. However, the substring we are checking is the entire bit string of the word. \n\n  But wait: the word is defined by the breaking, and the breaking must cover the entire substring. But the entire substring is the bit string of the word. \n\n  Therefore, the word appears if and only if its bit string appears as a contiguous substring of S.\n\n  And the set of valid words is the set of all sequences of letters (over the 26 letters) whose bit string (the concatenation) has length between 1 and 4*k (for a word of length k) and is composed of valid tokens (which is automatically satisfied if the bit string is the concatenation of the fixed codes for the letters) — but note: the fixed codes for the letters are the valid ones (except the four forbidden ones). \n\n  However, wait: the valid words are exactly the 26^k for k>=1, but not all bit strings of length 1 to 4*k are valid words. Only those bit strings that are the concatenation of valid tokens (each token being one of the 26 letters) are valid words.\n\n  But note: the problem says that the valid tokens are the 30-4=26 strings of length 1 to 4 (excluding the four forbidden ones). And the word is a sequence of one or more letters, so it is the concatenation of one or more valid tokens.\n\n  Therefore, the word's bit string is the concatenation of one or more valid tokens (each token is one of the 26). \n\n  Now, the condition for a word to appear is that its bit string (which is the concatenation of its tokens) appears as a contiguous substring of S.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is the number of distinct words (sequences of letters) such that the bit string of the word is a contiguous substring of S.\n\n  But note: the same word (sequence of letters) has only one bit string, so we are counting the distinct bit strings that are the concatenation of one or more valid tokens and appear in S.\n\n  However, wait: consider the word \"TT\": its bit string is \"11\". The word \"M\": its bit string is \"11\". So the same bit string \"11\" corresponds to two different words. \n\n  This is the catch! The same bit string",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a given string S, where each letter is encoded in Morse code (using '0' for dots and '1' for dashes). The Morse code representations must be valid (i.e., not one of the four forbidden strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\") and can be up to 4 characters long.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to process a string S character by character (either '0' or '1') and after each addition, count all distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any contiguous substring of S. Each sequence must be breakable into valid Morse code tokens (each token being a valid letter representation).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The distinct sequences of letters correspond to distinct bit strings (concatenations of valid Morse code tokens) that appear as substrings in S. However, the same bit string can represent different sequences if it can be broken into tokens in multiple ways. For example, the bit string \"11\" can represent either the letter 'M' (one token) or the sequence \"TT\" (two tokens).\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the set of valid token endings at position `i`. For each position, we check all possible token lengths (1 to 4) ending at `i` to see if they form valid Morse code. If valid, we add the corresponding letter to the set of words ending at `i`.\n\n4. **Tracking Distinct Words**: To avoid counting duplicate words, we maintain a global set `valid_words` that stores all distinct words encountered so far. After processing each character, we update the answer by considering new words formed by the current DP state.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently processes each character in O(1) per character by leveraging the DP array and a global set to track distinct words. The worst-case complexity is O(m), where m is the number of characters processed, making it suitable for large inputs (up to 3000 characters).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s = []\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        s.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    valid_letters = [\n        \"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\", \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"011\", \n        \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"111\", \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \n        \"1000\", \"00000\", \"00001\", \"00010\", \"00100\", \"01000\", \"10000\"\n    ]\n    valid_letters_set = set(valid_letters)\n    forbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    valid_letters_set -= forbidden\n    \n    mapping = {}\n    for idx, letter_bits in enumerate(valid_letters):\n        if letter_bits in valid_letters_set:\n            mapping[letter_bits] = chr(65 + idx)\n    \n    dp = [set() for _ in range(len(s))]\n    valid_words = set()\n    ans = []\n    total_count = 0\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        current_char = char\n        start_index = i\n        for length in range(1, 5):\n            if start_index - length + 1 < 0:\n                break\n            substr = ''.join(s[start_index - length + 1:start_index + 1])\n            if substr in valid_letters_set:\n                if length == 1:\n                    word_here = mapping.get(substr, None)\n                    if word_here is not None:\n                        dp[i].add(word_here)\n                        valid_words.add(word_here)\n                elif length == 2:\n                    word_here = mapping.get(substr, None)\n                    if word_here is not None:\n                        dp[i].add(word_here)\n                        valid_words.add(word_here)\n                elif length == 3:\n                    word_here = mapping.get(substr, None)\n                    if word_here is not None:\n                        dp[i].add(word_here)\n                        valid_words.add(word_here)\n                elif length == 4:\n                    word_here = mapping.get(substr, None)\n                    if word_here is not None:\n                        dp[i].add(word_here)\n                        valid_words.add(word_here)\n        \n        count_here = len(valid_words)\n        ans.append(str(count_here))\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input string and initializes necessary data structures, including a set of valid Morse code strings and a mapping from these strings to their corresponding letters.\n2. **Processing Each Character**: For each character added to the string S, the code checks all possible substrings ending at the current position (of lengths 1 to 4) to see if they are valid Morse code tokens.\n3. **Tracking Valid Words**: Valid tokens are converted to their corresponding letters and added to a set `dp[i]` (tracking valid words ending at position `i`).
