Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (number of rebels and bases) and then 2R+B points (R for rebels, then B for bases).\n We need to check if there is a perfect matching (one-to-one) between the R rebels and B bases such that:\n   - Each base gets exactly one rebel and vice versa (so R must equal B? Actually, the problem says: assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases, but the condition is that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. So this implies that R = B. But wait, the input constraints say 1<=R,B<=10, and the example inputs have R=B.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" with the conditions that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one base. This is a perfect matching only if R==B. If R != B, then it's impossible.\n\n Let me read the problem again: \n   \"every base has exactly one guardian\" -> so we need to cover all B bases, so we need at least B rebels.\n   \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" -> so we use all R rebels.\n\n Therefore, we must have R == B. Otherwise, no matching.\n\n But the input example: first input has R=3, B=3; second has R=2, B=1.\n\n So the second example: R=2, B=1 -> not equal, so output 'No'.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths from a base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect\", but if R != B then we cannot have a perfect matching (because one base would be left without or one rebel would have none). So we can immediately output 'No' if R != B.\n\n But note: the problem does not explicitly state that the number of bases and rebels must be equal. However, the matching condition requires that. \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read R and B.\n 2. If R != B, output 'No' and exit.\n\n However, wait: the example input format: \n   First line: \"3 3\"\n   Then 3 lines for rebels, then 3 lines for bases.\n\n But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input is given as a string in the example.\n\n However, the problem statement says: \"For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases.\"\n\n So the total lines are 1 + R + B.\n\n But note: the example input is provided as two separate strings: \n   Example 1: \"3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2\"\n   Example 2: \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\"\n\n In example 2, R=2, B=1. Then we have 2 rebels and 1 base. Since 2 != 1, we output 'No'.\n\n However, what if R != B? Then we don't even need to check the non-intersection condition.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\" such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. This is a bipartite matching problem with |R| = |B| required.\n\n So algorithm:\n\n Step 1: Read R and B.\n Step 2: If R != B, output 'No'.\n Step 3: If R == B, then we have to check if there exists a perfect matching between the rebels and bases such that the straight line segments (from base to its assigned rebel) do not cross.\n\n How to check for non-intersecting paths?\n\n Note: The problem states that no three points are collinear and no two points coincide.\n\n We are to assign each base to one rebel. The paths are straight lines.\n\n Conditions: Two edges (base1 -> rebel1) and (base2 -> rebel2) should not intersect (except possibly at endpoints? but endpoints are distinct and no three collinear so they won't share an endpoint).\n\n However, note that the endpoints are distinct and the problem says no three points are collinear. So the only intersections we worry about are when two edges cross in the middle.\n\n How to check for crossing? \n\n We can use the concept of non-crossing matching. One way is to consider the entire set of points (rebels and bases) and then try to draw non-crossing connections.\n\n Observation: We can order the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line paths connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. The solution involves checking two main conditions: first, that the number of Rebels equals the number of bases, and second, that the points can be matched without any crossing paths.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Counts**: The first step is to verify that the number of Rebels (R) matches the number of bases (B). If they don't, it's impossible to form a perfect matching, and we immediately return \"No\".\n\n2. **Order Points by X-coordinate**: If the counts match, we proceed by ordering all points (both Rebels and bases) based on their x-coordinates. This ordering helps in systematically checking for non-intersecting paths.\n\n3. **Perfect Matching Check**: Using a recursive approach, we attempt to match each base to a Rebel such that no two paths intersect. The algorithm checks all possible permutations of matches but prunes invalid paths early by ensuring that the current partial matching does not lead to any intersecting segments.\n\n4. **Non-intersection Condition**: For each potential match, the algorithm checks if adding the segment from the base to the Rebel would intersect with any existing segments. This is done using the concept of cross products to determine the relative orientation of three points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    R = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    rebels = []\n    bases = []\n    index = 2\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = float(data[index])\n        y = float(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = float(data[index])\n        y = float(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    combined = rebels + bases\n    combined.sort(key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))\n    \n    def is_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        def cross(o, a, b):\n            return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n        return cross(a, b, c) * cross(a, b, d) < 0 and cross(c, d, a) * cross(c, d, b) < 0\n        \n    def find_match(base_index, used_rebels, current_assignment):\n        if base_index == B:\n            return True\n            \n        base_point = bases[base_index]\n        for i in range(R):\n            if not used_rebels[i]:\n                rebel_point = rebels[i]\n                used_rebels[i] = True\n                current_assignment[base_index] = i\n                \n                valid = True\n                for prev_base_idx in range(base_index):\n                    prev_base_point = bases[prev_base_idx]\n                    prev_rebel_idx = current_assignment[prev_base_idx]\n                    prev_rebel_point = rebels[prev_rebel_idx]\n                    \n                    if is_intersect(prev_base_point, prev_rebel_point, base_point, rebel_point):\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    \n                if valid:\n                    if find_match(base_index+1, used_rebels, current_assignment):\n                        return True\n                        \n                used_rebels[i] = False\n                current_assignment[base_index] = -1\n                \n        return False\n        \n    used_rebels = [False] * R\n    current_assignment = [-1] * B\n    \n    if find_match(0, used_rebels, current_assignment):\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading and Initial Checks**: The input is read and parsed into the number of Rebels and bases, followed by their coordinates. If the counts don't match, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n\n2. **Sorting Points**: All points (Rebels and bases) are combined and sorted by their x-coordinates. This helps in systematically exploring possible matches without missing any configurations.\n\n3. **Intersection Check**: The `is_intersect` function uses cross products to determine if two line segments intersect. This is crucial for validating potential matches.\n\n4. **Recursive Matching**: The `find_match` function attempts to assign each base to a Rebel in a way that no segments intersect. It uses backtracking to explore all possibilities, pruning invalid paths early to improve efficiency.\n\n5. **Output Result**: After attempting all possible matches, the result is printed as \"Yes\" if a valid matching exists, otherwise \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the existence of a non-intersecting perfect matching by leveraging geometric properties and systematic backtracking.",
