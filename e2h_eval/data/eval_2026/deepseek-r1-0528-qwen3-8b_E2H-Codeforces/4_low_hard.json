The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (losses) for both players over n rounds.\n The game is played with two cyclic sequences A and B of length m and k respectively.\n\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Idea:\n Let f(i) = (a_i, b_i) for the i-th round, where a_i is from A and b_i from B, and the indices are taken modulo the lengths of A and B.\n\n But note: the sequences are cycled independently. In round j (0-indexed), \n   A_index = j % m\n   B_index = j % k\n\n Then we have a round outcome based on (a_j, b_j) = (A[j % m], B[j % k])\n\n We need to count:\n   For each round j (from 0 to n-1):\n        if A[j % m] beats B[j % k]? Then the player who chose the losing item gets a spot.\n        Specifically, if (A[j % m], B[j % k]) is one of the losing pairs for the first player (Nikephoros, who uses A), then Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus gets a spot? Wait, no:\n\n Actually, the problem states:\n   - The loser gets pinched (i.e., gains a red spot).\n\n So if in a round:\n   If A[j % m] beats B[j % k]: then Polycarpus (who used B) loses -> so Nikephoros gains a red spot? No, wait: the problem says the loser gets a red spot.\n\n But note: \n   - When Nikephoros (using A) wins, then Polycarpus (using B) loses -> so Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n   - When Polycarpus (using B) wins, then Nikephoros (using A) loses -> so Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n   - Draw: no one gets a spot.\n\n However, the example:\n     Input: \"7\\nRPS\\nRSPP\"\n     Output: \"3 2\"\n\n Explanation from example: \n     Round0: R vs R -> draw.\n     Round1: P vs S -> P beats S? Actually, no: the rules: Rock (R) beats Scissors (S); Scissors (S) beats Paper (P); Paper (P) beats Rock (R).\n             Here, P (from A) vs S (from B): S beats P? No, actually the rule says: \n                 Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock.\n             So: P vs S: P is paper, S is scissors -> scissors beats paper? Yes, so S (from B) beats P (from A). Therefore, the winner is Polycarpus (B) and the loser is Nikephoros (A). So Nikephoros gets one red spot.\n\n     Round2: S vs P -> S (from A) vs P (from B): S beats P? Yes, because Scissors beats Paper. So here, A wins, so Polycarpus loses -> gets one red spot.\n\n     Round3: R vs P -> R (from A) vs P (from B): R beats P? No, because Paper beats Rock. So Polycarpus wins -> Nikephoros loses, gets one red spot.\n\n     Round4: P vs R -> P (from A) vs R (from B): R beats P? Yes, so Polycarpus wins again? Actually, wait: \n            Here, A's move is P (paper) and B's move is R (rock). Rock beats Paper -> so B wins, so A loses -> Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n     Round5: S vs S -> draw.\n\n     Round6: R vs P -> same as round3: Polycarpus wins -> Nikephoros loses.\n\n     Total: \n         Nikephoros: rounds 1, 2, 4, 6 -> 4? But the example says 3.\n\n Wait, let me recount the example step-by-step as given:\n\n     Example description:\n        Round0: R - R. Draw.\n        Round1: P - S. Nikephoros loses.   [So at round1: A[0]=R, then A[1]=P; B[0]=R, then B[1]=S? Actually, the second line is \"RSPP\" for B? \n                But wait the input is:\n                  7\n                  RPS\n                  RSPP\n\n        So A = \"RPS\", B = \"RSPP\"\n\n        Round0: index0 of A (R) and index0 of B (R) -> draw.\n        Round1: index1 of A (P) and index1 of B (S) -> P",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and each round's outcome depends on the current move in their respective sequences. Given the constraints where `n` can be as large as 2·10^9, a brute-force simulation is infeasible. Instead, we leverage the periodicity of the sequences to compute the result efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, each using a cyclic sequence of moves (rock, paper, scissors). For each round, the outcome is determined by comparing the current moves from both sequences. The loser receives a red spot. The challenge is to count these spots efficiently over `n` rounds without simulating each round individually.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds for Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively. The combined period of both sequences is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`, denoted as `lcm`. By analyzing one full cycle (LCM rounds), we can determine the number of losses each player incurs per cycle. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Loss Calculation**: For each position within the cycle, compare the corresponding moves from both sequences and count the losses for each player.\n   - **Efficient Counting**: Use integer division to determine how many full cycles fit into `n` rounds and then handle any remaining rounds separately.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes the sequences once to precompute losses per cycle, resulting in a time complexity of O(m + k), which is efficient given the constraints (m, k ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    if m == 0 or k == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    lcm_val = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    total_nike_losses = 0\n    total_poly_losses = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm_val):\n        a_index = i % m\n        b_index = i % k\n        a_char = A[a_index]\n        b_char = B[b_index]\n        \n        if (a_char, b_char) == ('R', 'S') or (a_char, b_char) == ('S', 'P') or (a_char, b_char) == ('P', 'R'):\n            total_poly_losses += 1\n        elif (b_char, a_char) == ('R', 'S') or (b_char, a_char) == ('S', 'P') or (b_char, a_char) == ('P', 'R'):\n            total_nike_losses += 1\n            \n    num_cycles = n // lcm_val\n    remainder = n % lcm_val\n    \n    nike_red_spots = num_cycles * total_nike_losses\n    poly_red_spots = num_cycles * total_poly_losses\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        idx_A = (i % m)\n        idx_B = (i % k)\n        a_move = A[idx_A]\n        b_move = B[idx_B]\n        \n        if (a_move, b_move) == ('R', 'S') or (a_move, b_move) == ('S', 'P') or (a_move, b_move) == ('P', 'R'):\n            poly_red_spots += 1\n        elif (b_move, a_move) == ('R', 'S') or (b_move, a_move) == ('S', 'P') or (b_move, a_move) == ('P', 'R'):\n            nike_red_spots += 1\n            \n    print(f\"{nike_red_spots} {poly_red_spots}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B` used by Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of `A` and `B` determines the cycle length, allowing efficient processing of repeated patterns.\n3. **Loss Counting**: For each position in the cycle, the code checks the outcome of the move pair (from `A` and `B`) and increments the respective player's loss count if they lose.\n4. **Efficient Simulation**: The code calculates the number of full cycles and remaining rounds. It multiplies the losses per cycle by the number of full cycles and then processes the remaining rounds individually.\n5. **Output**: The total red spots for both players are printed, providing the solution efficiently even for very large `n`.\n\nThis approach ensures optimal performance by leveraging cycle detection and avoids the need for brute-force simulation, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
