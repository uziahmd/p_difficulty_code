He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n The function for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n Now, we are asked: for a given m (number of trailing zeros), find all positive integers n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note that the trailing zeros function Z(n) is non-decreasing. But note: it does not increase by one every time. For example, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, ... Z(9)=1, then Z(10)=2.\n\n Observation: \n   We are to find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n But note: the problem says \"exactly m zeroes\". So if we have two consecutive numbers that have the same number of trailing zeros, they both are included.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input m=1, Output: 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9)\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the range of n for which Z(n) = m.\n\n 2. How to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m? Actually, we want the smallest n such that Z(n) = m, but note: we might have jumps (like from 4 to 10, Z(4)=0, Z(10)=2). \n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   Let f(n) = Z(n). Then we are looking for all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   Note: f(n) is strictly increasing when n increases by 5? Actually, it increases in steps. But note: the same value of m can occur for a consecutive block of numbers.\n\n   Example: m=1: n from 5 to 9.\n\n   How to find the lower bound? We can use binary search to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m, and the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, the numbers n for which f(n)=m are those n in the interval [L, R-1] where:\n        L = smallest n with f(n) >= m\n        R = smallest n with f(n) >= m+1\n\n   Then, the condition is that for all n in [L, R-1], f(n)=m.\n\n   But wait: what if there is no n with f(n)=m? Then the set would be empty. For example, m=0? But the input m>=1. However, note that the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n   But also note: sometimes m might not be achieved? Actually, the function f(n) takes all integer values from 0 to infinity, but not necessarily consecutively? Actually, no: the trailing zeros increase by at least one every 5 numbers, but sometimes by more. However, the problem states that m is between 1 and 100000.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that m must be achieved. But the input constraint is 1<=m<=100000, so we assume m is achievable? Actually, let me check: \n\n   The maximum m we are given is 100000. The minimal n for which f(n)>=100000 might be very large, but note that we are only concerned with the existence of the interval [L, R-1] for which f(n)=m.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"positive integers n\", so we are considering all n>=1.\n\n   However, there is a caveat: sometimes the same m might be skipped? Actually, no: the function f(n) is non-decreasing and goes to infinity as n increases. But the steps are not necessarily 1. For example, from n=24 to n=25: \n        f(24)=4, f(25)=6 -> so m=5 is skipped.\n\n   Therefore, we must be cautious: if we are searching for m=5, then there is no n such that f(n)=5.\n\n   Then our algorithm must account for that.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   - We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m (call this L).\n   - We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1 (call this R).\n\n   Then, if f(L) != m, then there is no solution (because at L the trailing zeros jumped from below m to above or equal, but if it jumped over m then there is no n with exactly m). However, note:\n\n        We defined L as the smallest n with f(n) >= m. Then by definition, f(L) >= m. But it could be that f(L) > m? Then the entire block [L, R-1] has f(n) > m? Actually, no: because we defined R as the smallest n with f(n) >= m+1, so for n < R, f(n) < m+1, i.e., f(n) <= m.\n\n        Therefore, for n in [L, R-1]: f(n) is at least m and at most m (because if it were m+1 or more, then R would be <= n). But wait, R is the first n with f(n) >= m+1, so for n < R, f(n) < m+1. And since L is the first n with f(n) >= m, then for n in [L, R-1]: m <= f(n) < m+1. But f(n) is an integer, so f(n)=m.\n\n        However, wait: what if the jump is more than 1? For example, at n=25, f(24)=4, f(25)=6. Then if we are looking for m=5, then:\n            L = 25 (because f(25)=6 >=5, and 24<5)\n            R = 25 (because f(25)=6 >=6, so smallest n with f(n)>=6 is 25)\n\n        Then the interval [L, R-1] is [25,24] -> empty.\n\n        Therefore, we must check: if the smallest n with f(n)>=m is the same as the smallest n with f(n)>=m+1, then there is no n with f(n)=m.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n            Let L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n            Let R = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then, if f(L) == m, then the numbers n from L to R-1 are the solutions.\n        But wait, what if at L, f(L) is greater than m? Then we cannot have any n with f(n)=m.\n\n        Actually, we have to note: the function f is non-decreasing, but it can jump over m. Then the set {n: f(n)=m} is empty.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: if f(L) > m, then there's no solution. But note: we defined L as the smallest n with f(n)>=m, so if f(L)>m then indeed there is no n with f(n)=m.\n\n        However, we don't actually compute f(L) until we get L. But we can compute f(L) by the formula.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Find L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m.\n            Step 2: Check if f(L) == m. If not, then output 0 and we are done.\n\n            But wait, how do we check? We can compute f(L) by the formula.\n\n            However, note: we don't want to compute f(L) by the same formula we used to find L because we might use a different method.\n\n        Actually, we can use binary search to compute L and then check f(L). But note: the formula for f(n) is:\n\n            def trailing_zeros(n):\n                count = 0\n                divisor = 5\n                while divisor <= n:\n                    count += n // divisor\n                    divisor *= 5\n                return count\n\n        But note: n can be very large (since m up to 100000). However, the minimal n for m=100000 is about 400000 (because 5^10 is 10^7, and 5^11 is about 48 million, so n must be around 400000). But 400000 is acceptable for a while loop? Actually, the while loop runs log5(n) which is about 8 iterations even for n=10^9.\n\n        However, we are going to do two binary searches (for m and m+1) and then one more check. So total about 3 * (log(n)) operations, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: we cannot use linear search for n because m can be up to 100000 and n can be very large. We must use binary search.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Define:\n            def zeros(n):\n                # returns the number of trailing zeros in n!\n                count = 0\n                i = 5\n                while i <= n:\n                    count += n // i\n                    i *= 5\n                return count\n\n        Then, we need to find the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= m.\n\n        How to do that?\n\n            low = 0, high = something large enough.\n\n        What should be the high? Note: zeros(n) is roughly n/4 (since the series is n/5 + n/25 + ... < n/4). So for m=100000, we need n such that zeros(n)>=100000. We can set high to, say, 5*m (but sometimes we need more, because the formula is less than n/4). Actually, we can set high = 5*m * 5? Or use an initial estimate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            low = 0\n            high = 5*m   # but wait, zeros(5*m) = zeros(5*m) = (5*m)//5 + (5*m)//25 + ... which is m + m//5 + m//25 + ... which is definitely >= m.\n\n        However, sometimes we might need more than 5*m? Let me check: zeros(5*m) is at least m (from the first term: (5*m)//5 = m). So we can set high = 5*m.\n\n        But note: we are going to search for two values: m and m+1. So we need to set high to a value that is definitely >= the minimal n for m+1.\n\n        However, the minimal n for m+1 might be larger than 5*(m+1). But note: zeros(n) grows roughly as n/4, so to get zeros(n) >= m, we need n to be at least about 4*m. But we set high=5*m, which is safe.\n\n        But wait, what if m=0? The problem says m>=1, so we don't need to worry.\n\n        Steps for binary search for a given target (say m):\n\n            def find_lower_bound(target):\n                low = 0\n                high = 5 * target   # because zeros(5*target) >= target (at least the first term gives target)\n\n                while low < high:\n                    mid = (low + high) // 2\n                    if zeros(mid) < target:\n                        low = mid + 1\n                    else:\n                        high = mid\n                return low\n\n        Then:\n            L = find_lower_bound(m)\n            R = find_lower_bound(m+1)\n\n        Then, we check: if zeros(L) != m, then there is no solution. But wait, by definition, zeros(L) >= m. However, if zeros(L) > m, then there is no solution. But note: we defined L as the smallest n with zeros(n)>=m, so zeros(L) is at least m. But if zeros(L) > m, then we have skipped m.\n\n        However, we can also note: the numbers n for which zeros(n)=m are the ones from L to R-1, provided that zeros(L)==m. Because zeros(L) is the first time we hit at least m, and zeros(R-1) is less than m+1 (so it is either m or less). But if zeros(L) > m, then there is no n with zeros(n)=m.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: if zeros(L) == m, then the answer is the numbers from L to R-1 (inclusive). Otherwise, there are 0 numbers.\n\n        Example: m=1\n            zeros(5)=1 -> so L = 5 (since zeros(4)=0 <1, zeros(5)=1>=1 -> so L=5)\n            Then R = find_lower_bound(2): \n                zeros(10)=2 -> so R=10? Actually, let's check:\n                zeros(5)=1, zeros(6)=1, zeros(7)=1, zeros(8)=1, zeros(9)=1, zeros(10)=2.\n                So R=10.\n\n            Then the numbers are from 5 to 9 (inclusive) -> 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n        Example: m=5\n            We know from the example that there is no n with zeros(n)=5.\n            We need to find L for m=5: smallest n with zeros(n)>=5.\n                zeros(20)=4, zeros(21)=4, zeros(22)=4, zeros(23)=4, zeros(24)=4, zeros(25)=6 -> so L=25.\n            Then zeros(25)=6, which is not 5 -> so we output 0.\n\n        Therefore, the plan:\n\n            Read m.\n\n            Define function zeros(n) as above.\n\n            Define function find_lower_bound(target) that returns the smallest n such that zeros(n) >= target.\n\n            Then:\n                L = find_lower_bound(m)\n                R = find_lower_bound(m+1)\n\n            If zeros(L) != m:\n                Print 0\n            Else:\n                Print (R - L)  [the number of integers from L to R-1]\n                Then print the numbers from L to R-1, each on a separate line? But the example output format: \n                    First print k (the count) then print the k integers in increasing order, one per line? \n\n                However, the example output: \n                    Input: 1\n                    Output: \n                        5\n                        5 6 7 8 9\n\n                But wait, the example output is: \n                    ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9']\n\n                Actually, the example output format is: \n                    First line: k (the count)\n                    Second line: the k integers separated by spaces.\n\n                However, the example output string is shown as a list: ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9'].\n\n                But note: the problem says: \n                    First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n                It doesn't specify whether to put them on separate lines or the same line. But the example output has two lines.\n\n                Actually, the example input is given as ['1', '5'] meaning two test cases? Wait, no: the problem says \"The only line of input contains an integer m\". So the example input is just one integer: 1.\n\n                And the example output is two lines.\n\n                So we output:\n\n                    Line1: the count k (as a string)\n                    Line2: the k integers separated by spaces (if k>0) or nothing (if k==0).\n\n                But wait, the example input is provided as a list of strings? Actually, the problem says: \n                    Input: The only line of input contains an integer m.\n\n                So we read one integer.\n\n                However, the sample output is given as: \n                    ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9'] \n\n                This is a list containing one string that has two lines. So we output:\n\n                    k = (number of integers) as a string, then a newline, then the list of integers (if any) as a string of space separated numbers.\n\n                But wait, the example input is 1, and the output is two lines.\n\n                However, note: the problem says \"First print k — the number of values... Then print these k integers...\"\n\n                So we must output two lines.\n\n                Example: \n                    Input: 1\n                    Output: \n                        5\n                        5 6 7 8 9\n\n                Another example: \n                    Input: 5\n                    Output: \n                        0\n\n                But wait, the example input 5 should output 0, and then nothing else? Actually, the problem says: \"Then print these k integers\", so if k=0, we don't print any integers.\n\n                However, the example output for m=5 is given as ['0']? Actually, the example output for m=5 is shown as the second element in the list: ['1','5'] -> output ['0'].\n\n                But wait, the example input was given as two examples: \n                    Input: ['1', '5'] \n                    Output: ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n                So the first example input is '1', and the second example input is '5'.\n\n                Therefore, we write:\n\n                    if zeros(L) != m:\n                        print(0)\n                    else:\n                        k = R - L   # because the numbers are from L to R-1, inclusive -> total numbers = (R-1 - L + 1) = R - L\n                        print(k)\n                        if k > 0:\n                            # Format the numbers from L to R-1 as a string of space separated numbers.\n                            # But note: k can be up to ...? The numbers from L to R-1 are consecutive. The maximum k? \n                            # Since m is up to 100000, the numbers L and R-1 can be very large (like 500000). But we cannot generate a list of up to 100000 numbers? Actually, the gap between L and R-1 can be large.\n\n                However, note: the trailing zeros function increases by more than one sometimes (like from 24 to 25: from 4 to 6). Therefore, the gap R-L might be small (like 1) or even 0 (if zeros(L) > m). But we already checked zeros(L)==m, so the gap is at least 1.\n\n                But wait: if zeros(L)==m, then R is the first n with zeros(n)>=m+1. Then the numbers from L to R-1 are the ones that have zeros(n)=m. The gap is (R-1 - L + 1) = R - L.\n\n                However, the gap can be large? Actually, the gap is the length of the plateau at m. But note: the trailing zeros function increases by the number of factors of 5 (and 2) in the next numbers. The plateau at m is the set of consecutive numbers that do not add a factor of 5 (until the next multiple of 5 that adds one or more). \n\n                But the maximum gap? It can be as large as 4? Actually, no: because after a number that is a multiple of 5, the next multiple of 5 will cause an increase. But sometimes we have multiples of 25, 125, etc.\n\n                However, the gap can be arbitrarily long? Actually, no: the gap is at most 4? \n\n                Why? Consider: \n                    We are at a number n that is a multiple of 5, say 5*k. Then the next multiple of 5 is 5*(k+1). In between, the trailing zeros remain constant. So the gap is (5*(k+1) - 5*k) - 1 = 4? Actually, no: the numbers are from 5*k to 5*(k+1)-1, which is 5 numbers: 5*k, 5*k+1, 5*k+2, 5*k+3, 5*k+4. But wait, at 5*k we add one factor of 5 (if k is not divisible by 5 then we add one; if k is divisible by 5, then we add more). \n\n                Actually, the plateau for a fixed m is broken by the next multiple of 5. But note: the plateau for m might extend beyond a multiple of 5? No, because at the next multiple of 5, we add at least one factor of 5, so the trailing zeros increase.\n\n                Therefore, the numbers for which zeros(n)=m form a contiguous block, and the length of the block is at most 5? Actually, no: consider m=0: then n from 1 to 4. That's 4 numbers. But m>=1.\n\n                Actually, the trailing zeros function increases at multiples of 5. The value of zeros(n) remains constant between multiples of 5. So the plateau is exactly the numbers from a multiple of 5 (or from a number that is not a multiple of 5) to the next multiple of 5 minus one. But the plateau might start at a number that is not a multiple of 5? \n\n                Example: m=1: starts at 5 (which is a multiple) and ends at 9 (which is the next multiple of 5 is 10). So the plateau is 5,6,7,8,9 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                Why 5 numbers? Because from 5 to 9 (inclusive) is 5 numbers.\n\n                Actually, the trailing zeros for n! increases at multiples of 5. And the increase is the number of times 5 divides (n/5) plus the number of times 5 divides (n/25) etc. But note: when n is a multiple of 5, we add at least one factor of 5, so the trailing zeros increase.\n\n                The plateau for m is from the smallest multiple of 5 (or the next integer after the last multiple that had m-1) to the next multiple of 5 (exclusive). \n\n                But wait: the plateau for m might start at a non-multiple of 5? Actually, no: because the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5. So the value of zeros(n) is constant for n in [a, b] where a and b are consecutive multiples of 5? Not exactly: consider n=5,6,7,8,9: the trailing zeros are all 1. Then n=10: zeros(10)=2.\n\n                So the plateau is from the first n (which is a multiple of 5) to the next multiple of 5 minus one. Therefore, the length of the plateau is 5? \n\n                But wait: if we have a multiple of 25, then at that multiple, we add two factors of 5 (if we consider base 10, then one 5 and one another 5 from 25). So zeros(24)=4, zeros(25)=6. Then the plateau for m=5 is empty. But the plateau for m=4 is from 20 to 24 (5 numbers). And the plateau for m=6 is from 25 to 29 (5 numbers). \n\n                However, the plateau length is always 5? \n\n                Actually, yes: because the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5. And the next multiple of 5 is 5 away. Therefore, the plateau for a given m (if it exists) is exactly 5 consecutive numbers? \n\n                But wait: what if m is achieved by a multiple of a higher power? \n\n                Example: m=2. \n                    zeros(10)=2, zeros(11)=2, zeros(12)=2, zeros(13)=2, zeros(14)=2, zeros(15)=3 (because 15 adds one factor of 5, so zeros(15)=floor(15/5)+floor(15/25)=3+0=3).\n                    So the plateau for m=2 is from 10 to 14 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                Another: m=3.\n                    zeros(15)=3, then zeros(16)=3, ... zeros(19)=3, zeros(20)=4 (because 20 adds one factor, so 3+1=4).\n                    Plateau: 15 to 19 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                Therefore, the plateau is always 5 numbers? \n\n                Then why the example m=1: 5 numbers, m=2:5, m=3:5, m=4:5, m=5: none, m=6:5.\n\n                But wait: what if the plateau is broken by a multiple of 25? \n\n                Example: m=5 is broken because we jump from 4 (at 24) to 6 (at 25). \n\n                Therefore, the plateau length is 5 unless the next multiple of 5 is a multiple of a higher power (like 25) and then we skip some m's.\n\n                But note: the plateau for m is defined by the consecutive numbers that have the same trailing zeros. The trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5. And the change is by the number of factors of 5 in that multiple. \n\n                However, the plateau for a given m is the set of numbers from the smallest n0 (which is the multiple of 5 that first achieves m) to the next multiple of 5 minus one, unless the plateau is broken by an increase that is more than one (then m is skipped). \n\n                Therefore, the plateau length is always 5, except when the next multiple of 5 is a multiple of 5^k (k>=2) then the trailing zeros jump by k, and then the plateau for m might be broken (if the jump skips m). But the plateau length itself is still 5, because the trailing zeros only change at multiples of 5.\n\n                However, the plateau for a particular m (if it exists) is 5 consecutive numbers. \n\n                Then the gap (R - L) is 5? \n\n                But wait: in the example m=1: L=5, R=10 -> R-L=5, so the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                Similarly, for m=2: L=10, R=15 -> R-L=5.\n\n                For m=3: L=15, R=20 -> 5.\n\n                For m=4: L=20, R=25 -> 5.\n\n                For m=5: no solution.\n\n                For m=6: L=25, R=30 -> 5.\n\n                Therefore, the gap is always 5 if m is present, except that sometimes m is skipped and then we get 0.\n\n                But wait: what if m=0? \n                    zeros(n)=0 for n from 1 to 4 -> so L=1, R=5 -> gap 4? But the problem says m>=1.\n\n                However, the problem says m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n                But wait: what if m=100000? Then the plateau length is 5, so we output 5 numbers? \n\n                But wait, let me check: \n                    zeros(5*k) = k + k//5 + k//25 + ... \n                    zeros(5*k+4) = same as zeros(5*k) because no new factor of 5 is added until 5*(k+1).\n\n                Therefore, the plateau for m (if it exists) is always 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n                Then why did we use R = find_lower_bound(m+1)? \n\n                Actually, the plateau is from L to L+4 (if the plateau length is 5). Then R = L+5? \n\n                Example: m=1: L=5, then zeros(5)=1, zeros(6)=1, zeros(7)=1, zeros(8)=1, zeros(9)=1, zeros(10)=2. So the next multiple of 5 (which is 10) is the start of the next plateau. Then R = 10, which is L+5.\n\n                So the gap is 5, and the numbers are from L to L+4, which is 5 numbers.\n\n                Therefore, we can also compute the answer without knowing the exact R, but by knowing that the plateau is 5 numbers long if it exists.\n\n                However, note: the plateau length is always 5? \n\n                Consider: what if n is a multiple of 25? Then at n=25, we add two factors of 5. But the plateau for m=5 is broken. The plateau for m=4 is from 20 to 24 (5 numbers) and then at 25, we jump to m=6.\n\n                Now, what if we have a multiple of 125? Then we add three factors. Then we might skip two m's.\n\n                But the plateau length is still 5? \n\n                Example: n=124: \n                    zeros(124) = 24 + 4 + 0 = 28? \n                    Let me calculate: \n                        124//5 = 24, 124//25=4, 124//125=0 -> 28.\n                    zeros(125) = 125//5 + 125//25 + 125//125 + 125//625 = 25+5+1+0=31.\n\n                Then the plateau for m=28 is from 120 to 124 (5 numbers). Then at 125, we jump to 31.\n\n                So the plateau length is still 5.\n\n                Therefore, the plateau for a given m (if it exists) is always 5 consecutive numbers.\n\n                Then, we can simplify:\n\n                    We want to know if there exists an n such that zeros(n)=m.\n\n                    The condition is that the minimal n for which zeros(n) >= m must have zeros(n)=m, and then the next multiple of 5 (which is L+5) must have zeros(L+5) >= m+1.\n\n                But note: zeros(L) is computed by our function, and we already know zeros(L)>=m. And zeros(L+5) is the next multiple of 5, so it must be >= zeros(L)+ (at least 1). But wait, the increase at L+5 (if L is a multiple of 5) is the number of factors of 5 in (L+5). \n\n                However, we don't need to rely on the plateau length being 5 for the binary search. The binary search method is correct.\n\n                But note: the gap (R-L) is the length of the plateau. And the plateau length is the number of consecutive n for which zeros(n)=m. And that length is 5, unless the plateau is broken by a jump that skips m (then the plateau doesn't exist). \n\n                However, we already found that if zeros(L) != m then the plateau doesn't exist.\n\n                But wait, we can also use the fact that the plateau length is 5 to optimize? \n\n                However, the problem constraints say m from 1 to 100000, and the binary search for n (which goes up to 5*m) is efficient (since log(n) is about 20). \n\n                But the problem is that we are required to output the numbers from L to R-1 (if they exist). And the gap can be 5, but also note: what if the plateau is broken by a jump that is more than one? Then zeros(L) might be m, but then zeros(L+1) is still m? \n\n                Actually, no: the plateau is defined by the trailing zeros being constant. The trailing zeros change only at multiples of 5. Therefore, if L is a multiple of 5, then zeros(L) = m, zeros(L+1)=m, ..., zeros(L+4)=m, and zeros(L+5) = m + (additional factors from L+5). \n\n                Therefore, the plateau is 5 numbers.\n\n                Then, the code:\n\n                    Read m.\n                    Compute L = smallest n with zeros(n)>=m.\n                    Compute R = smallest n with zeros(n)>=m+1.\n\n                    If zeros(L) != m: \n                        print(0)\n                    Else:\n                        k = R - L   # which should be 5, unless the plateau is broken by a higher multiple? But wait, our R is defined as the first n with zeros(n)>=m+1. Since zeros(L)=m, then zeros(L+1)=m (because L+1 is not a multiple of 5, so no change) until the next multiple of 5. Then zeros(L+5) = m + (additional factors). But zeros(L+5) might be >= m+1? \n\n                        Actually, zeros(L+5) might be m+1 or more. Then R would be L+5 (if zeros(L+5) >= m+1). Then k = R - L = 5.\n\n                        But what if zeros(L+5) is exactly m+1? Then R = L+5, so the numbers are from L to L+4 (5 numbers). \n\n                        What if zeros(L+5) is more than m+1? Then R is still L+5 (because we are looking for the first n with zeros(n)>=m+1, and zeros(L+5) is >=m+1). Then k=5.\n\n                        However, what if zeros(L+5) is still less than m+1? Then R would be greater than L+5. But wait, by our earlier reasoning, zeros(L) is m, and then the next multiple of 5 is L+5. At L+5, we add at least one factor of 5 (unless L+5 is not a multiple of 5? But L is a multiple of 5, so L+5 is the next multiple). \n\n                        Therefore, zeros(L+5) >= m+1. \n\n                        So the plateau is always 5 numbers if it exists.\n\n                But wait: what if the plateau starts at a non-multiple of 5? \n\n                Actually, our L is the smallest n such that zeros(n)>=m. It is possible that L is not a multiple of 5? \n\n                Example: m=1. The smallest n with zeros(n)>=1 is 5, which is a multiple.\n\n                Example: m=0. Then L=0? But m>=1.\n\n                Actually, the trailing zeros function only changes at multiples of 5, so the minimal n with zeros(n)=m must be a multiple of 5. Therefore, L is always a multiple of 5.\n\n                Therefore, the plateau is always 5 numbers.\n\n                Then we can simply output 5 numbers if zeros(L)==m, but wait: what if m is achieved by a non-multiple? \n\n                Example: m=1, the minimal n is 5 (multiple). \n\n                Another: m=2, minimal n=10 (multiple).\n\n                So the plateau is always 5 numbers.\n\n                But wait: what if m=0? Then minimal n=0? But m>=1.\n\n                Therefore, we can conclude:\n\n                    If zeros(L) == m, then there are exactly 5 numbers: L, L+1, L+2, L+3, L+4.\n\n                However, wait: the example m=1: \n                    L=5, then the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                But what if the plateau is broken by a higher power? \n\n                Example: m=6: \n                    zeros(25)=6, zeros(26)=6, zeros(27)=6, zeros(28)=6, zeros(29)=6, zeros(30)=7 (because 30 adds one factor: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 -> total 7). \n                    So the plateau is 5 numbers.\n\n                But wait: zeros(25)=6, zeros(26)=6, ... zeros(29)=6, zeros(30)=7.\n\n                So the plateau is 5 numbers.\n\n                Therefore, we can simplify the code:\n\n                    Read m.\n                    L = find_lower_bound(m)\n                    if zeros(L) != m:\n                        print(0)\n                    else:\n                        print(5)\n                        # Then print the 5 numbers: L, L+1, L+2, L+3, L+4\n\n                But wait: what if the plateau is longer than 5? \n\n                Example: what if we have a number that is a multiple of 5, but the next multiple of 5 is more than 5 away? \n\n                Actually, the next multiple of 5 is always 5 away. \n\n                However, note: the trailing zeros function changes at every multiple of 5. Therefore, the plateau is exactly the 5 numbers from L to L+4.\n\n                But wait: what if L",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of the primes 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is dictated by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). This count is calculated as \\( Z(n) = \\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\rfloor + \\ldots \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( L \\) such that \\( Z(L) \\geq m \\). Similarly, we find the smallest integer \\( R \\) such that \\( Z(R) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values lie in the interval \\([L, R-1]\\), provided \\( Z(L) = m \\). If \\( Z(L) > m \\), then no such \\( n \\) exists.\n\n3. **Efficiency Consideration**: The binary search approach efficiently narrows down the range of \\( n \\) values without checking each number individually, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of \\( Z(n) \\). The function \\( Z(n) \\) is computed using a loop that divides \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        return\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    \n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    L = low\n    \n    if zeros(L) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        R = L + 5\n        k = R - L\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            numbers = [str(i) for i in range(L, R)]\n            print(\" \".join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `zeros(n)`**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is initialized with `low` set to 0 and `high` set to \\( 5 \\times m \\), ensuring the search space covers all potential candidates for \\( L \\).\n\n3. **Finding \\( L \\)**: The binary search adjusts `low` and `high` to find the smallest \\( L \\) where \\( Z(L) \\geq m \\). \n\n4. **Validation Check**: After finding \\( L \\), the solution checks if \\( Z(L) \\) exactly equals \\( m \\). If not, it outputs 0, indicating no valid \\( n \\) exists. Otherwise, it outputs the count of valid numbers (which is always 5 if \\( Z(L) = m \\)) and lists them from \\( L \\) to \\( L+4 \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution space using binary search and leverages mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to provide the correct answer.",
