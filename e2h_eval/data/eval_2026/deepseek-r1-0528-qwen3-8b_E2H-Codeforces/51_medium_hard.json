Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile) with the combined frequency of the first two.\n 3. If the two frequencies match exactly (same letters and same counts), then output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that the pile should be exactly the letters from the two names (without extra or missing).\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines, strip the newlines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines to form a string that represents all the letters needed.\n - Count the frequency of each letter in the concatenated string and in the third string.\n - Compare the two frequency counts.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   We combine: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   Then we count the letters in \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" and compare with the count in \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\".\n\n But note: the example input has a trailing newline? We use strip to remove any extraneous whitespace.\n\n However, note the example input format: the input is given as an array of three strings for one sample, but actually the input will be three lines.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Important: The problem says the input lines do not exceed 100 characters.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   s1 = first line.strip()\n   s2 = second line.strip()\n   s3 = third line.strip()\n\n   total_letters = s1 + s2\n   freq_total = frequency map of total_letters\n   freq_pile = frequency map of s3\n\n   if freq_total == freq_pile: then YES, else NO.\n\n But wait, what if there are extra letters or missing letters? The above condition checks that the two frequency maps are identical.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"there won't be any extra letters\", meaning the pile must have exactly the letters from the two names (and no more). \n\n So this comparison is exactly what we need.\n\n Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n   s1 = \"SANTACLAUS\", s2 = \"DEDMOROZ\", so total_letters = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Now, the pile string is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Let's break down:\n\n   total_letters: \n      S:2, A:2, N:1, T:2, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:2, M:1, O:1, R:1, Z:1\n\n   pile_letters: \n      S:2, A:2, N:1, T:2, M:2, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy. Let me recount:\n\n   total_letters = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n      S: appears at index0, index5 -> 2\n      A: index1, index6 -> 2\n      N: index2 -> 1\n      T: index3 -> 1, index8 -> 2 (but wait, let me write out)\n      Actually, let's count:\n\n        SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\n        S:2, A:2, N:2 (because in \"SANTACLAUS\": N at position2, and then in \"DEDMOROZ\" there's no N? Actually, wait: \n        SANTACLAUS: S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> wait, let me count properly:\n\n        SANTACLAUS: \n          S:2 (first and last)\n          A:3 (second, fifth, eighth) -> wait, let me break:\n\n        Actually, better to use a program.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the example says it's valid.\n\n   Let me count the example manually:\n\n   Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S -> \n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   Host: DEDMOROZ -> \n        D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Combined: \n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:2, M:2, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   Wait, in the pile: \n        T:2 (from 'TA' in SANTA and then MOROZ has one T? Actually, let me break the pile string:\n\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:2 (from SANTA and then the T in MOROZ? Actually, MOROZ has one T? No, MOROZ has no T. But wait, the word is SANTAMOROZ: \n        The guest name was SANTACLAUS and host was DEDMOROZ. The pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". \n\n        Let me break the pile: \n          SANTA -> S,A,N,T,A (so two A's and one T so far)\n          MOROZ -> M,O,R,O,Z (no T)\n          DED -> D,E,D (no T)\n          CLAUS -> C,L,A,U,S (no T)\n\n        So T appears only once? Then why did I think T:2?\n\n        Actually, the example input for the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". Let me count T:\n\n        S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S\n\n        Positions: \n          S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S\n\n        There is one T.\n\n        But wait, the example says: \n          Input: ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\n        And the expected output is \"YES\".\n\n        So what's the issue? \n\n        Let me recount the combined names:\n\n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n        Host: DEDMOROZ ->\n            D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Combined: \n            S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n            Let me break down the pile string:\n\n            S: appears at the beginning and at the end -> 2\n            A: appears at index1, index4, index15 -> 3\n            N: index2 -> 1\n            T: index3 -> 1\n            M: index5 -> 1\n            O: index7 and index8 -> 2\n            R: index9 -> 1\n            Z: index10 -> 1\n            D: index11 and index12 -> 2\n            E: index13 -> 1\n            C: index14 -> 1\n            L: index16 -> 1\n            U: index17 -> 1\n\n        So indeed the counts match.\n\n        Why did I initially think the pile had two T's? I must have miscounted.\n\n        Therefore, our method is correct.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We can use collections.Counter to count the frequency.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   import collections\n\n   s1 = input().strip()\n   s2 = input().strip()\n   s3 = input().strip()\n\n   total_count = collections.Counter(s1 + s2)\n   pile_count = collections.Counter(s3)\n\n   if total_count == pile_count:\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 2: \n   Input: \n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Expected: \"NO\"\n\n   Let me check:\n\n   Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n   Count the letters in the combined string and compare with \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   We can do:\n\n   combined = \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n   Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   We'll use Counter.\n\n   Alternatively, we can see that the example says there's an extra letter 'L' and a missing 'P'. \n\n   But note: the example says \"letter 'P' is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter 'L'\".\n\n   So the pile has an extra 'L' and missing 'P'. Therefore, the counts won't match.\n\n Example 3:\n\n   Input: \n        BABBONATALE\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n   Expected: \"NO\"\n\n   The example says there's an extra letter 'L'.\n\n   So again, the counts won't match.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a list of three strings, but the actual input is three lines.\n\n   We'll assume the input is read from stdin.\n\n   Code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the example input format in the problem statement is:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This is just showing the entire input as a list for one test case. In reality, we read three lines.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n   import collections\n\n   def main():\n        lines = []\n        for _ in range(3):\n            lines.append(input().strip())\n\n        # The first two lines are the names, the third is the pile.\n        total_letters = lines[0] + lines[1]\n        pile_letters = lines[2]\n\n        count_total = collections.Counter(total_letters)\n        count_pile = collections.Counter(pile_letters)\n\n        if count_total == count_pile:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, the problem states that the input lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters.\n\n   We can use this.\n\n   But note: the example input may have been given without stripping? Actually, the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", and we use strip() to remove any potential newline or spaces.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples through this code.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   Example 3:\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, note: the example input in the problem statement is provided as a list of three strings for one sample, but the actual input might have multiple test cases? \n\n   But the problem says: the input file consists of three lines.\n\n   So we are reading three lines.\n\n   Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\n   But wait, the example input format in the problem statement is shown as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This is confusing because they are using a list of three strings, each string being the three lines? \n\n   Actually, looking at the example input, it's three separate lines. The problem says three lines.\n\n   Our code reads three lines.\n\n   Let me run the provided example 1 in the code:\n\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Then we combine Line1 and Line2: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n   Then we count:\n\n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   Then the pile: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1, D:2, E:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n\n   They are the same.\n\n   So we output \"YES\".\n\n   Example 2:\n\n        Line1: \"PAPAINOEL\"\n        Line2: \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n        Line3: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n\n        Count:\n          P:3, A:3, I:1, N:1, O:2, E:1, J:1, L:1, U:2, K:2\n\n        Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Count:\n          J:1, O:2, U:3, L:2, N:1, A:3, P:1, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n        They don't match.\n\n   Example 3:\n\n        Line1: \"BABBONATALE\"\n        Line2: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n        Line3: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Combined: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Count: (manually, but we trust the Counter)\n\n        Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Count: \n\n        We can see that the pile has two 'L's in \"ALLE\" (from \"BONATALLE\") and the original combined has one 'L' (from \"BONATALE\" and then \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" doesn't have an extra L). \n\n        So the pile has one extra L.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must use the `collections` module.\n\n   Since the constraints are small (each line <= 100) we don't worry about performance.\n\n   Code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves comparing the frequency of each letter in the combined names with the frequency of letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name, respectively. The third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string to get all the required letters.\n3. **Count Frequencies**: Use a frequency counter (like `collections.Counter`) to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Compare Frequencies**: If the frequency counts of the combined names and the pile match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of letters by leveraging the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, which simplifies the counting process and comparison.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef main():\n    s1 = input().strip()\n    s2 = input().strip()\n    s3 = input().strip()\n    \n    total_letters = s1 + s2\n    pile_letters = s3\n    \n    count_total = collections.Counter(total_letters)\n    count_pile = collections.Counter(pile_letters)\n    \n    if count_total == count_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three lines from standard input, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names**: The first two strings (guest and host names) are concatenated into one string, representing all the letters needed.\n3. **Frequency Counting**: The `collections.Counter` is used to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile of letters.\n4. **Comparison**: The code checks if the frequency counts of the combined names and the pile are identical. If they are, it prints \"YES\", indicating the pile can form the names exactly; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis method efficiently verifies the solution by leveraging Python's built-in tools for handling character frequencies, ensuring correctness and simplicity.",
