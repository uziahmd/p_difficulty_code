For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'] (12 notes)\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing the semitone index starting from C=0.\n    Note: The problem states that the notes repeat cyclically. So we have 12 notes.\n\n 2. Since the input is three notes, we might have to consider all permutations (orderings) of the three notes.\n\n 3. For each permutation, we can compute the distances (in semitones) between consecutive notes and then the total distance from first to last (which should be the sum of the two segments, but note: the circle has 12 semitones, so we need to consider modulo).\n\n However, note: the problem says that the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (meaning going up from E to C wraps around? Actually, the example says: \n    \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\"\n\n But wait: the problem defines the distance as taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. However, when ordering the chord, we are to order the notes along the musical scale (so in increasing tone). \n\n How to handle circularity?\n    We can map the notes to numbers, and then for each note, we can have two directions. However, the problem says we can order the notes so that the distances are defined.\n\n    Conditions for major: \n        There must exist an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n            distance(X, Y) = 4 semitones and distance(Y, Z) = 3 semitones.\n\n        Then the distance from X to Z (if we go via Y) would be 7, but note: there are two ways to go from X to Z: \n            One way: X->Y->Z: 7 semitones.\n            The other way: X-> ... ->Z: 12-7=5 semitones? But the problem defines the distance from the lowest to the highest. \n\n    However, note: the definition does not require that the entire chord fits in one octave without wrapping? Actually, the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically.\n\n    But the example: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" — that is because if we start at E and go up 8 semitones we get to C (since E->F->F#->G->G#->A->A#->B->C, but wait there's no A# in our list? Actually, the list is: \n        [0: 'C', 1: 'C#', 2: 'D', 3: 'D#', 4: 'E', 5: 'F', 6: 'F#', 7: 'G', 8: 'G#', 9: 'A', 10: 'B', 11: 'H'] \n\n    Wait, there's a problem: the example says the third note is H, which is the same as B? Actually, in some systems, H is used for B (but in others, B is used). The problem states: \n        \"notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H\"\n\n    Let me map:\n        C:0, C#:1, D:2, D#:3, E:4, F:5, F#:6, G:7, G#:8, A:9, B:10, H:11.\n\n    Then the example: E (4) to C (0): \n        If we go from E (4) to C (0) in the circle, we can go forward: 4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11->0: that's 8 steps (each step is one semitone). \n        Alternatively, backward: 4->3->2->1->0: that's 4 steps? But the problem says the distance is from the lowest to the highest. \n\n    However, the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". This implies that the distance is defined as the smallest non-negative number of semitones to go from one to the next in the cyclic manner? Actually, no: it says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that when we have two notes, we consider the absolute difference in the circular way, but always taking the positive direction? \n\n    But note: the example uses the ordering of the chord. The chord is considered as an unordered set, but then we order the notes so that the distances are defined.\n\n    How to compute the distance between two notes in the circle?\n\n    We can define a function to compute the distance from note a to note b (in semitones) as the smallest non-negative step from a to b in the forward direction (without wrapping backwards). However, the problem defines the distance from the lowest to the highest, so we want the minimal distance that goes upwards (i.e., without going the long way around)? \n\n    But wait: the example says the distance from E to C is 8, not 4. Why? Because the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that we are only considering the upward direction? Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\".\n\n    So, if we have two notes, say E and C, then E is higher than C in pitch if we are in the same octave? But then the distance from E to C would be negative? \n\n    Alternatively, they might mean: we arrange the two notes on the circle and take the upward distance (which is the minimal distance if we don't exceed 6 semitones? Or the other way?).\n\n    Actually, let's read the example again: \n        \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones\" — that's clear, because C is 0, E is 4, so 4-0=4.\n        \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" — because if we start at E (4) and go to C (0), we have to go 8 semitones (because 4+8 mod12 = 12 mod12=0). \n\n    So the distance from E to C is defined as (0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8.\n\n    Therefore, we can define the distance from note a to note b (in the upward direction, i.e., from lower to higher in pitch) as:\n        dist(a, b) = (b - a) % 12   [if b>=a then (b-a) else (b-a+12)]\n\n    But note: the problem does not specify whether the chord is ordered by pitch. However, the definition for the triad requires an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distances between consecutive ones are 4 and 3 (in two consecutive segments). \n\n    Steps:\n\n    1. Map the input notes to numbers.\n\n    2. Generate all permutations of the three notes (there are 6).\n\n    3. For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n        Let d1 = (Y - X) % 12\n        Let d2 = (Z - Y) % 12\n\n        But note: the entire circle: the total from X to Z must be (d1+d2) % 12, but also we can consider the direct path from X to Z is (Z-X)%12, which should equal (d1+d2) % 12? Actually, yes, because (Z-X) %12 = (Z-Y+Y-X) %12 = (d2 + d1) %12.\n\n        However, the condition for major is: d1 == 4 and d2 == 3. But wait: what if we consider the upward direction? \n\n        But note: the example \"C E G\": \n            C=0, E=4, G=7.\n            d1 = (4-0)%12 = 4 -> correct.\n            d2 = (7-4)%12 = 3 -> correct.\n\n        Example minor: \"C# B F\" -> but wait the example says: order as \"B C# F\"\n            B=10, C#=1, F=5.\n\n        Now, from B to C#: (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12 = 3 -> correct for the first segment (should be 3 for minor).\n        Then from C# to F: (5-1)%12 = 4 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input was given as \"C# B F\", but we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily.\n\n        So algorithm for a given permutation (x, y, z):\n\n            d1 = (y - x) % 12\n            d2 = (z - y) % 12\n            d3 = (z - x) % 12   # which should be (d1+d2) %12, but we don't need it.\n\n        Condition for major: d1==4 and d2==3.\n        Condition for minor: d1==3 and d2==4.\n\n        But wait: what if the entire chord spans more than one octave? \n\n        Example: consider the chord with notes E, G, A (which is a major chord). \n            E=4, G=7, A=9.\n            Ordering: E, G, A: \n                d1 = (7-4)%12 = 3 -> not 4, so not major by this ordering.\n\n        But wait, we must consider all orderings. Let's try ordering E, A, G? \n            That doesn't make sense because we want consecutive in the scale. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\".\n\n        So we must consider the natural order (lowest to highest) in terms of the circle. But note: the circle wraps.\n\n        Alternative: we can order the three notes by their numerical value (which represents the semitone) and then check the intervals.\n\n        However, the example \"C E G\": \n            Notes: [0,4,7] -> sorted: [0,4,7]\n            Then: from 0 to 4: 4, from 4 to 7: 3 -> major.\n\n        Example minor: [10,1,5] -> sort: [1,5,10]\n            Then: from 1 to 5: 4, from 5 to 10: 5 -> not matching.\n\n        So we cannot just sort by the number. We have to consider circular ordering.\n\n        How about: we can break the circle at the lowest note (in terms of the numerical value) and then check the intervals? But wait, the example \"C# B F\": \n            Numerical: [1,10,5]. The sorted by number: [1,5,10] -> then the intervals: 5-1=4, 10-5=5 -> doesn't fit.\n\n        But the example orders as B, C#, F. In the circle, the notes are arranged as: ... , 10 (B), 11 (H=C?), 0 (C), 1 (C#)... \n\n        Actually, the problem says the notes are repeated cyclically. So we can arrange the three notes in the circle and consider the gaps.\n\n        Another approach: \n            Let the three notes be a, b, c (with their numbers). We can arrange them in increasing order (without breaking the circle) by duplicating the octave? \n\n        However, note: the definition does not require the entire chord to be within one octave. It just requires that the distances (as defined in the upward direction) are as specified.\n\n        But the example \"C# B F\": \n            We have to break the circle so that we start at B (10) and then go to C# (1) and then to F (5). \n            The distance from B to C#: (1 - 10) %12 = 3 (because 1-10 is negative, so add 12: 3). \n            Then from C# to F: (5-1)%12=4.\n\n        So we must consider the circular arrangement.\n\n        Steps for a given permutation (x,y,z):\n\n            We can calculate the two consecutive distances: \n                d1 = (y - x) % 12   -> but if negative, we add 12 until positive? Actually, modulo 12 we can do: \n                d1 = (y - x) % 12   -> but wait: (y-x) might be negative. In Python, (y-x) %12 gives a nonnegative result.\n\n            Similarly, d2 = (z - y) % 12.\n\n        Then we check if (d1, d2) is either (4,3) or (3,4).\n\n        However, note: the entire chord must cover 7 semitones from the first to the last? Actually, the condition is independent of the entire chord.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the chord is unordered, so we can choose any starting point and then two consecutive steps.\n\n        However, we must consider that the chord has three distinct notes? The problem does not say they are distinct, but typically chords have distinct notes. The problem says \"set\", so probably distinct.\n\n        Also, the problem says: Vasya promises the answer will be unambiguous, so we don't have to worry about both conditions being true.\n\n        But note: we are checking all permutations. There are 6 permutations. \n\n        Example: C, E, G: \n            Permutations: \n                [0,4,7]: d1=(4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major.\n                [0,7,4]: d1=(7-0)=7, d2=(4-7)= (4-7+12)=9 -> not major/minor.\n                [4,0,7]: d1=(0-4+12)=8, d2=(7-0)=7 -> no.\n                [4,7,0]: d1=(7-4)=3, d2=(0-7+12)=5 -> no.\n                [7,0,4]: d1=(0-7+12)=5, d2=(4-0)=4 -> no.\n                [7,4,0]: d1=(4-7+12)=9, d2=(0-4+12)=8 -> no.\n\n            So only one permutation works.\n\n        Example minor: [10,1,5] (B, C#, F)\n            Permutations: \n                [10,1,5]: d1=(1-10)%12= (1-10+12)=3, d2=(5-1)%12=4 -> minor.\n                [10,5,1]: d1=(5-10+12)=7, d2=(1-5+12)=8 -> no.\n                [1,10,5]: d1=(10-1)=9, d2=(5-10+12)=7 -> no.\n                [1,5,10]: d1=(5-1)=4, d2=(10-5)=5 -> no.\n                [5,10,1]: d1=(10-5)=5, d2=(1-10+12)=3 -> no.\n                [5,1,10]: d1=(1-5+12)=8, d2=(10-1)=9 -> no.\n\n        So we found one.\n\n        But wait: what if the chord is actually a diminished chord? For example, three notes equally spaced: 3, 3, 6? \n            Example: C, Eb, Ab? \n            Let me map: C=0, Eb=D#=3, Ab=G#=8.\n            Check: \n                [0,3,8]: d1=3, d2=5 -> not major/minor.\n                [0,8,3]: d1=8, d2=(3-8+12)=7 -> no.\n                [3,0,8]: d1=(0-3+12)=9, d2=(8-0)=8 -> no.\n                [3,8,0]: d1=5, d2=(0-8+12)=4 -> no.\n                [8,0,3]: d1=(0-8+12)=4, d2=(3-0)=3 -> major? But wait: 4 and 3 -> major? \n                But wait: the chord is C, Eb, Ab. Is that a major chord? \n                Actually, no: a major chord is built by root, major third (4 semitones) and perfect fifth (7 semitones). \n                Here, from C to Eb is 3 semitones (minor third) and from Eb to Ab is 5 semitones (tritone) which is not a perfect fifth (which is 7). \n\n            However, in our calculation: [8,0,3] -> \n                d1 = (0-8+12)=4, d2=(3-0)=3 -> so it fits the condition for major? But the condition says: \n                    \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\"\n\n                Then the chord would be called major? But that doesn't match the standard definition.\n\n            Let me check: the condition does not require that the entire chord is contained in one octave? \n\n            In standard music theory, a major chord is defined by the intervals: root, major third (4 semitones above root), and perfect fifth (7 semitones above root). \n\n            However, in our condition, we are only requiring two consecutive intervals: 4 and then 3. \n\n            But note: the entire chord must have three notes. The condition does not require that the third interval (from X to Z) is 7? Actually, the two consecutive intervals (4 and 3) give a total of 7, so the three notes are 7 semitones apart from the first to the last. \n\n            In the example [8,0,3]: \n                From note at 8 (Ab) to note at 0 (C): 4 semitones (so the next note is C, which is 4 above Ab). Then from C to Eb (3) is 3 semitones. \n\n            But wait: the chord is {Ab, C, Eb}. This is a minor chord? \n\n            Standard: minor chord: root, minor third (3 semitones), and perfect fifth (7 semitones). \n\n            How do we represent {Ab, C, Eb}?\n                Let me arrange: Ab (0), then C (4) is 4 semitones above Ab? Actually, no: \n                Ab is 8, then next note C is 0 (which is 12-8=4 below? Or above? We are defining upward distance.\n\n            Our calculation: from Ab to C: (0-8+12)=4 -> so that's a major third? Then from C to Eb: (3-0)=3 -> minor third.\n\n            But the standard chord with root Ab would be:\n                Ab, A##b? No, the standard Ab major chord: Ab, C, Eb? Actually, no: the major chord on Ab is Ab, C, Eb? \n\n            Wait, the major chord is built by root, major third (4 semitones) and perfect fifth (7 semitones). \n            For Ab (root): \n                Major third: Ab + 4 semitones -> Ab, A, A#, Bb, B, C -> wait, let's count from Ab (8):\n                    8 -> 9 (A), 10 (B), 11 (C?) -> wait, our mapping: \n                        Ab is 8, then 9 is A, 10 is B, 11 is H (which is B? or C? Actually, the problem says: \n                        The notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H -> so H is the last, which is 11.\n\n            So from Ab (8) to C (0): 0 is the same as 12, so 12-8=4 -> yes, 4 semitones. Then from Ab to Eb: \n                Eb is 3. From 8 to 3: (3-8+12)=7 -> perfect fifth.\n\n            So the chord {Ab, C, Eb} is actually a major chord? But wait, the notes are: Ab, C, Eb. \n            In standard: \n                Ab major: Ab, Bb, and D? \n\n            Wait, I think I'm confusing. Let me build Ab major:\n                Root: Ab (8)\n                Major third: 4 semitones above Ab: 8+4=12 -> 0 (which is C) -> correct.\n                Perfect fifth: 7 semitones above Ab: 8+7=15 -> 15 mod12=3 (Eb) -> so yes, Ab major is {Ab, C, Eb}. \n\n            So the example [8,0,3] (which is Ab, C, Eb) is a major chord.\n\n            Now, what about the same chord in a different ordering? \n\n            But wait, the problem says the chord is an unordered set. So we can have any order.\n\n        So our method: check all 6 permutations and if we find one that satisfies (4,3) then output \"major\", if we find one that satisfies (3,4) then output \"minor\", and if none of them does, then \"strange\".\n\n        However, note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we don't have to worry about both conditions being met.\n\n        But wait: could a chord satisfy both conditions? \n            Condition for major: exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that (Y-X)%12=4 and (Z-Y)%12=3.\n            Condition for minor: exists an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that (Y-X)%12=3 and (Z-Y)%12=4.\n\n            Example: if we have a chord that is both major and minor? \n\n            Let me see: \n                Suppose we have two different orderings: one for major and one for minor.\n\n            Example: is there a chord that can be interpreted as major and minor? \n\n            Consider the chord {C, E, G} is major. Is it minor? \n                We need an ordering (X,Y,Z) such that (Y-X)%12=3 and (Z-Y)%12=4.\n\n                Let's try: \n                    [C, E, G]: 0,4,7 -> 4-0=4, 7-4=3 -> major.\n                    [E, G, C]: (0-4+12)=8, (4-0)=4 -> no.\n                    [C, G, E]: (7-0)=7, (4-7+12)=9 -> no.\n                    [G, C, E]: (0-7+12)=5, (4-0)=4 -> no.\n                    [E, C, G]: (0-4+12)=8, (7-0)=7 -> no.\n                    [G, E, C]: (4-7+12)=9, (0-4+12)=8 -> no.\n\n                So not.\n\n            Another example: the diminished chord? {C, Eb, Gb} -> but let's map: C=0, Eb=3, Gb=6 (if we use Gb as the flat fifth: F# is 6, but Gb is the same as F#). \n\n            Actually, let's use: \n                C=0, Db=1, Eb=2, E=3, F=4, Gb=5? Wait, no: the problem's note set is fixed. \n\n            The problem's note set: \n                C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n            So we don't have Gb, we have F# (which is the same as E#? no, in 12-TET, F# is 6). \n\n            Let me take the diminished chord: {C, Eb, G} -> but Eb is D# (which is 3) and G is 7. \n            Then the set: {0,3,7}. \n                Check for major: \n                    [0,3,7]: d1=3, d2=4 -> minor? \n                    [0,7,3]: d1=7, d2=(3-7+12)=8 -> no.\n                    [3,0,7]: d1=(0-3+12)=9, d2=7 -> no.\n                    [3,7,0]: d1=4, d2=(0-7+12)=5 -> no.\n                    [7,0,3]: d1= (0-7+12)=5, d2=3 -> no.\n                    [7,3,0]: d1=(3-7+12)=8, d2=(0-3+12)=9 -> no.\n\n                So not major nor minor? But wait, the condition for minor: we found [0,3,7] gives (3,4) -> so minor. \n\n            But is {0,3,7} a minor chord? \n                Standard minor chord: root, minor third (3 semitones), and perfect fifth (7 semitones). \n                Here, if we take root as C (0): \n                    minor third: 3 -> D# (Eb) -> correct.\n                    perfect fifth: 7 -> G -> correct.\n\n            So {C, Eb, G} is a minor chord.\n\n            But wait, the standard diminished chord is {C, Eb, Gb} (which is {0,3,6}). \n\n            So the chord {0,3,7} is minor, and {0,3,6} is diminished.\n\n        Therefore, our method is:\n\n            Step 1: Map the input notes to numbers (0 to 11) using the provided list.\n\n            Step 2: Generate all 6 permutations of the three numbers.\n\n            Step 3: For each permutation (x,y,z):\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n                If (d1, d2) == (4, 3): then this permutation forms a major chord -> return \"major\"\n                If (d1, d2) == (3, 4): then this permutation forms a minor chord -> return \"minor\"\n\n            Step 4: If we found one, output accordingly. Otherwise, output \"strange\".\n\n        However, note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. We are checking all orderings, so we are good.\n\n        But wait: what if the chord is given with duplicate notes? The problem says \"unordered set\", so we assume distinct. \n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Example: Input \"A B H\" (from example) -> ['A','B','H'] -> [9,10,11]\n            Permutations:\n                [9,10,11]: d1=(10-9)=1, d2=1 -> no.\n                [9,11,10]: d1=(11-9)=2, d2=(10-11+12)=11 -> no.\n                [10,9,11]: d1=(9-10+12)=11, d2=2 -> no.\n                [10,11,9]: d1=1, d2=(9-11+12)=10 -> no.\n                [11,9,10]: d1=(9-11+12)=10, d2=1 -> no.\n                [11,10,9]: d1=(10-11+12)=11, d2=(9-10+12)=11 -> no.\n\n            Output \"strange\", which matches.\n\n        Example: Input \"C E G\" -> major, Input \"C# B F\" -> minor.\n\n        But wait: the example input \"C# B F\": \n            Notes: C# (1), B (10), F (5)\n            We mapped: \n                C:0, C#:1, D:2, D#:3, E:4, F:5, F#:6, G:7, G#:8, A:9, B:10, H:11.\n\n            So the input \"C# B F\" becomes [1,10,5]\n\n            We already checked [1,10,5]: \n                d1 = (10-1)%12 = 9 -> wait, no! \n\n            Let me recalculate: \n                (10-1) = 9 -> 9 %12=9, then d2=(5-10)%12 = (-5)%12=7 -> no.\n\n            But wait, in our earlier manual calculation we did:\n                [10,1,5]: \n                    d1 = (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)=3, d2=(5-1)%12=4.\n\n            So we must consider the permutation [10,1,5] (i.e., [B, C#, F]).\n\n            Therefore, we must generate all permutations, including the one that starts with B.\n\n            How did we get [10,1,5]? \n                The original set: [1,10,5] -> one permutation is [10,1,5].\n\n            So we must generate all 6.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            We'll create a list of the three note numbers.\n\n            Then, from itertools import permutations\n\n            for perm in permutations(note_list):\n                x, y, z = perm\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    print(\"major\")\n                    exit(0)   # or break and then continue to minor if not found? Actually, we can break and output \"major\"\n\n                elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    print(\"minor\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            print(\"strange\")\n\n        But wait: the example \"C E G\" and \"C# B F\" are handled correctly.\n\n        However, note: the modulo operation: \n            (y-x) % 12: this is equivalent to (y-x) if y>=x, or (y-x+12) if y<x.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem says the distance from E to C is 8. In our calculation for [E,C,something] we would do (C-E) %12 = (0-4+12)=8, which is correct.\n\n        Let me test with the example \"C E G\" in the permutation [E, G, C]:\n            [4,7,0]: \n                d1 = (7-4)%12=3, d2=(0-7)%12=(-7)%12=5 -> not major/minor.\n\n        But wait, we are only checking consecutive segments. The condition requires two consecutive segments: 4 and then 3 (for major) or 3 and then 4 (for minor). \n\n        In the permutation [E, G, C] we are not getting 4 and 3, so it's not major. And we don't require the entire chord to be contiguous in the circle without wrapping? Actually, the condition is defined for consecutive notes in the ordering (which we are providing). \n\n        But note: the problem says \"the distance along the musical scale\" — meaning that we are moving from X to Y and then from Y to Z. The entire movement from X to Z must be the sum of the two segments, but the circle might wrap. However, the condition only requires the two consecutive segments.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            Step 1: Map the input string.\n\n            We are given one line with three space separated notes.\n\n            Example: \"C E G\"\n\n            Steps:\n\n            notes_map = {\n                'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11\n            }\n\n            Read the input, split, then map each note.\n\n            Then do the permutation check.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        Edge: if the input has less than 3 distinct notes? The problem says \"triads\", so exactly three notes. And the set is unordered. But if there are duplicates, then the set has less than three distinct notes. The problem says \"three space-separated notes\", so we assume three. But duplicates? \n\n        According to the problem: \"an unordered set\", so if duplicates, then the set has less than three. Then we cannot form a triad. \n\n        However, the problem says \"exactly three notes\", so we assume three distinct? \n\n        But the problem says \"Vasya promises the answer will always be unambiguous\", so probably the input has three distinct notes.\n\n        We'll assume the input has three distinct notes.\n\n        Code:\n\n            import itertools\n\n            data = input().split()\n            if len(data) != 3:\n                # but the problem says three, so we assume three\n                # but let's be safe: if not, then strange?\n                # Actually, the problem says three, so we proceed with three.\n                pass\n\n            mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n            try:\n                notes = [mapping[note] for note in data]\n            except KeyError:\n                # The problem says the notes are from the set, so this shouldn't happen.\n                print(\"strange\")\n                exit(0)\n\n            # Generate all permutations\n            perms = itertools.permutations(notes)\n\n            major_found = False\n            minor_found = False\n\n            for p in perms:\n                x, y, z = p\n                d1 = (y - x) % 12\n                d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    major_found = True\n                elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                    minor_found = True\n\n            if major_found:\n                print(\"major\")\n            elif minor_found:\n                print(\"minor\")\n            else:\n                print(\"strange\")\n\n        But wait: what if the same permutation satisfies both? \n            Condition for major: (4,3) and minor: (3,4). They are different, so no.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the answer is unambiguous, so we don't have to worry about both being true.\n\n        But wait: what if two different permutations yield one major and one minor? Then the chord is both major and minor? \n\n        Example: is there a chord that can be seen as both? \n\n        We saw that {C, E, G} is major and cannot be minor. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously\", so we are safe.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Vasya promises the answer will always be unambiguous\", meaning that there is no chord that is both.\n\n        But wait: our method marks both major_found and minor_found if we find a permutation for major and a permutation for minor. \n\n        Example: let me check if there exists a chord that is both:\n\n            We need two different orderings: one for major and one for minor.\n\n            Example: {X, Y, Z} such that:\n                Ordering (a,b,c): (b-a)%12=4, (c-b)%12=3 -> major.\n                Ordering (d,e,f): (e-d)%12=3, (f-e)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n            And the set {a,b,c} = {d,e,f}.\n\n            This is possible? \n\n            Example: Consider the chord {C, E, G}: \n                We found one ordering [C,E,G] for major. \n                We did not find an ordering for minor.\n\n            Example: Consider the chord {C, E, G#",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific distance criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each musical note is mapped to a unique integer from 0 to 11 based on its position in the chromatic scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: All six possible permutations of the three input notes are generated to explore every possible ordering.\n3. **Checking Chord Conditions**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated. A major chord requires the first distance to be 4 semitones and the second to be 3 semitones. A minor chord requires the first distance to be 3 semitones and the second to be 4 semitones.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation meets the major chord condition, the answer is \"major\". If any permutation meets the minor chord condition, the answer is \"minor\". If neither condition is met by any permutation, the answer is \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n    \n    try:\n        notes = [mapping[note] for note in data]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n    \n    perms = list(itertools.permutations(notes))\n    major_found = False\n    minor_found = False\n\n    for p in perms:\n        x, y, z = p\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            major_found = True\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            minor_found = True\n            \n    if major_found:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif minor_found:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of three space-separated notes. These notes are split into a list and each note is mapped to its corresponding integer value using a predefined dictionary.\n2. **Permutations Generation**: The `itertools.permutations` function generates all six possible orderings of the three input notes.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Condition Check**: The solution checks if any permutation satisfies the major chord condition (distances 4 and 3 semitones) or the minor chord condition (distances 3 and 4 semitones). If either condition is met, the corresponding result is printed. If neither condition is satisfied, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical notes.",
