There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m and then m lines of restrictions [l_i, r_i, x_i]\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming or try to assign heights satisfying all constraints.\n\n However, note: the profit function is a^2 for each house. The goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\n The challenge is that the restrictions impose that in some intervals the maximum height is bounded by x_i.\n\n Observation:\n Since the constraints are independent and the objective is separable (each house's profit depends only on its own height), \n we can think of assigning a height to each spot such that for every restriction (l, r, x): \n   the maximum height in the interval [l, r] is <= x.\n\n But note: we have multiple restrictions that might overlap.\n\n Approach:\n We can consider using DP with state as (position, current height) but then how to incorporate the restrictions?\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the restrictions and then use a constraint satisfaction. However, the problem is small (n=50) but the state space for a single house is (h+1) and h<=50, so 51 states per house, and 50 houses would be 50*51 which is 2550, but then we must check the restrictions for each state? \n\n But note: there are up to 50 restrictions. Checking all restrictions for each state might be expensive if we do it naively.\n\n Another idea: since the constraints are that in each restriction i, the entire interval [l_i, r_i] must have max <= x_i.\n\n We can also note that the profit function is quadratic and increasing (since a^2 is increasing for a>=0). Therefore, for each house we want to set the height as high as possible (but constrained by the restrictions and the global h).\n\n However, the restrictions are not independent: one house may be part of several intervals.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. For each house i, we have a base constraint: height[i] <= h.\n 2. Additionally, for each restriction j that covers house i (i.e., l_j <= i <= r_j), we have height[i] <= x_j.\n\n But note: even if a house is in multiple restrictions, the actual constraint for that house is the minimum of the base h and all the x_j from the restrictions that cover it. However, wait: that is not entirely correct because the restriction says the tallest house in the interval must be at most x_j. This means that the house itself can be at most x_j, but also the other houses in the same interval must be at most x_j. So the constraint for a house is just the minimum over all restrictions covering it? Actually, no: because if two restrictions apply, they both require the house to be <= their x_j. But note: the same house must satisfy both. So the house i must be <= min( h, x_j for every restriction j that includes i ).\n\n However, that is not the whole story: the restrictions are on intervals. Even if we set each house to the minimum of h and the restrictions that cover it, we must ensure that the entire interval [l_j, r_j] does not exceed x_j. But if we set each house independently to the minimum of h and the restrictions that cover it, then the condition for restriction j is automatically satisfied because every house in [l_j, r_j] is at most x_j (by the definition of the restriction j and the fact that we set house i to at most x_j if j covers i). But wait: what if two restrictions j and k both cover house i, and j has x_j and k has x_k, and we set house i to min(h, x_j, x_k). Then for restriction j: the house i is <= x_j, and similarly for k. However, the entire interval [l_j, r_j] must have every house <= x_j. And we set every house in [l_j, r_j] to at most x_j (because if a house is in [l_j, r_j] then j covers it, so we set it to <= x_j). Similarly for k.\n\n Therefore, we can set for each house i: \n    a_i = min( h, min_{j: l_j<=i<=r_j} { x_j } )\n\n Then the profit is the sum of a_i^2.\n\n But wait: is that always optimal? Consider: we want to maximize the profit. The profit function is a_i^2. It is increasing and strictly convex. Therefore, for each house we want to set the height as high as possible. However, the above assignment sets the house to the minimum of h and the restrictions. But note: if we set a house to a value higher than the minimum of the restrictions, then we break a restriction. So we cannot set higher than the minimum of the restrictions that cover it. Therefore, the above assignment is the maximum we can set for each house independently.\n\n However, wait: is the condition \"the tallest house in the interval must be at most x_j\" automatically satisfied by setting each house to at most x_j? Yes, because then the entire interval has all houses <= x_j, so the tallest is <= x_j.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n Step 1: Precompute for each house i (from 1 to n) the effective maximum height: \n        effective_max[i] = min( h, min_{j: the restriction j covers i} { x_j } ) \n        If there are no restrictions covering i, then effective_max[i] = h.\n\n Step 2: Then set the height of house i to effective_max[i]. Then the profit is sum(i=1 to n) (effective_max[i]^2).\n\n But wait: is that really the maximum? What if by lowering one house we could raise another? \n\n Let me reconsider: the restrictions are independent and the profit function is separable. Each house's height is constrained by the restrictions that include it. However, note: the restrictions are on intervals. The catch: when we set a house to a lower value, we don't break any restriction (as long as the value is still within the constraints). But the goal is to maximize the sum of squares. Since the square function is increasing, we want each house to be as high as possible. Therefore, we should set each house to the maximum allowed by the restrictions that cover it. \n\n However, consider an example: \n   n=2, h=10, m=1, restriction: [1,2] with x=5.\n\n Then without the restriction, we would set [10,10] -> profit 10^2+10^2=200.\n With the restriction, we set [5,5] -> profit 25+25=50.\n\n Now, what if we set house1 to 5 and house2 to 10? Then the restriction [1,2] requires that the tallest house in [1,2] is <=5, but house2=10 breaks the restriction.\n\n Similarly, if we set house1 to 10 and house2 to 5, then the restriction [1,2] requires the tallest house in [1,2] is <=5, but house1=10 breaks the restriction.\n\n So we must set both to 5.\n\n Now, what if we have two restrictions?\n Example from the sample: \n   Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n   House1: covered by restriction1 -> effective_max[1] = min(3,1)=1.\n   House2: covered by restriction2 -> effective_max[2] = min(3,3)=3.\n   House3: covered by restriction3 -> effective_max[3] = min(3,2)=2.\n\n   Then profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4=14.\n\n   The sample output is 14.\n\n But wait: what if we set house1 to 1, house2 to 3, house3 to 2. That matches.\n\n Another sample: \n   Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n   Houses: 1,2,3,4.\n\n   Restrictions:\n      Restriction1: [2,3] -> x=8\n      Restriction2: [3,4] -> x=7\n\n   For house1: no restriction -> 10.\n   For house2: restriction1 -> min(10,8)=8.\n   For house3: both restrictions -> min(10,8,7)=7.\n   For house4: restriction2 -> min(10,7)=7.\n\n   Profit: 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n   Matches the sample.\n\n However, wait: what if we have overlapping restrictions that are not aligned with the entire interval? \n\n Example: \n   n=3, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] with x=5\n   Restriction2: [2,3] with x=8\n\n   Then:\n     House1: only restriction1 -> 5\n     House2: both -> min(10,5,8)=5\n     House3: restriction2 -> 8\n\n   Profit: 25+25+64 = 114.\n\n   Is that the maximum? \n     House1: cannot exceed 5 (because of restriction1)\n     House2: must be <=5 (because of restriction1) and <=8 (restriction2) -> so 5 is maximum allowed for house2.\n     House3: must be <=8 (restriction2)\n\n   So yes.\n\n But wait: what if we have a restriction that doesn't cover the entire street? \n\n Example: \n   n=3, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,3] with x=5\n   Restriction2: [1,3] with x=8\n\n   Then for each house: effective_max[i] = min(10,5,8)=5.\n\n   Profit: 3 * 25 = 75.\n\n   This is correct because the more restrictive restriction (x=5) applies.\n\n Therefore, the method is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, h, m.\n   Step 2: For each of the m restrictions, read (l, r, x).\n   Step 3: For each house i (from 1 to n), let \n            eff[i] = h\n            For each restriction (l, r, x) such that l <= i <= r:\n                eff[i] = min(eff[i], x)\n\n   Step 4: Sum = 0\n            for i from 1 to n:\n                a = eff[i]\n                Sum += a*a\n\n   Step 5: Print Sum.\n\n However, wait: is that correct? \n\n Why is it correct? Because each house i is constrained by all restrictions that cover it. The restriction requires that the house is at most x (and the global h). Therefore, the house must be at most the minimum of h and the x's of the covering restrictions.\n\n And since the square function is increasing, we set each house to the maximum allowed value (which is eff[i]). \n\n But note: the problem says that the tallest house in a restriction's interval must be at most x_i. By setting every house in the interval to at most x_i, we satisfy the condition. And we set each house to the maximum allowed by all restrictions that cover it, so we get the maximum profit.\n\n However, let me test with a potential pitfall:\n\n Example: \n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] with x=5\n   Restriction2: [1,2] with x=8\n\n   Then for house1: min(10,5,8)=5, house2: min(10,5,8)=5 -> profit 50.\n\n   Correct.\n\n But what if we have two restrictions that are different and overlapping, but one is more restrictive only on a subset?\n\n Example: \n   n=3, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] with x=5\n   Restriction2: [2,3] with x=8\n\n   Then house1: only restriction1 -> 5\n         house2: both -> min(10,5,8)=5\n         house3: restriction2 -> 8\n\n   This is correct.\n\n But wait: what if we have two restrictions that together force a house to be lower than necessary? \n\n Example: \n   n=3, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,2] with x=5\n   Restriction2: [1,3] with x=8\n\n   Then house1: min(10,5,8)=5\n         house2: min(10,5,8)=5\n         house3: min(10,8)=8\n\n   This is correct.\n\n However, note: the restrictions are independent. The method seems to work.\n\n But wait: what if a house is not covered by any restriction? Then we set it to h, which is the maximum allowed.\n\n Example: \n   n=2, h=10, m=1\n   Restriction: [1,1] with x=5\n\n   Then house1: min(10,5)=5\n        house2: no restriction -> 10\n\n   Check restriction: [1,1] only requires house1<=5. House2 can be 10. And the entire interval [1,1] has max=5, so okay.\n\n   Profit: 25 + 100 = 125.\n\n   Without the restriction, we could set house2 to 10 and house1 to 10, but the restriction forces house1 to 5. So 5^2+10^2=125 is correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   restrictions = []\n   for _ in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        l = int(data[0]); r = int(data[1]); x_val = int(data[2])\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x_val))\n\n   # Create an array for the effective maximum for each house (index 0 to n-1 for spots 1 to n)\n   eff = [h] * n   # initially set to h\n\n   for (l, r, x_val) in restrictions:\n        # Adjust l, r to 0-indexed: l-1 to r-1\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < eff[i]:\n                eff[i] = x_val\n\n   total_profit = 0\n   for a in eff:\n        total_profit += a * a\n\n   print(total_profit)\n\n But wait: the sample input format is given as two examples. The first example input is:\n\n        '3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2'\n\n   Our code:\n\n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        restrictions: \n          (1,1,1) -> update index0 to min(3,1)=1\n          (2,2,3) -> update index1 to min(3,3)=3\n          (3,3,2) -> update index2 to min(3,2)=2\n\n        Then total_profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4=14 -> correct.\n\n   Second example:\n\n        '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7'\n\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        restrictions:\n          (2,3,8) -> update indices 1 and 2: set to min(10,8)=8 for both.\n          (3,4,7) -> update indices 2 and 3: set to min(10,7)=7 for both.\n\n        Then:\n          index0: 10\n          index1: 8\n          index2: min(8,7)=7\n          index3: 7\n\n        Total: 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n   So the code produces the sample outputs.\n\n However, wait: is there a possibility that by setting a house to a lower value we could allow adjacent houses to be higher? \n\n Example: \n   n=2, h=10, m=1\n   Restriction: [1,2] with x=5\n\n   Then by our method: both houses must be <=5. So profit 25+25=50.\n\n   But what if we set house1 to 4 and house2 to 5? Then the maximum in the interval is 5, which satisfies the restriction. The profit is 16+25=41, which is less than 50.\n\n   Or if we set house1 to 5 and house2 to 4, same thing: 25+16=41.\n\n   So why did we get 50? Because we set both to 5. But note: the square function is increasing, so for each house we want to set it as high as possible. In the interval [1,2] we set both to 5, which is the maximum allowed. Therefore, 50 is the maximum.\n\n   Now, consider:\n\n   n=2, h=10, m=2\n   Restriction1: [1,1] with x=5\n   Restriction2: [2,2] with x=5\n\n   Then house1=5, house2=5 -> profit 50.\n\n   But what if we set house1 to 4 and house2 to 5? Then the restrictions are satisfied (house1<=5 and house2<=5). The profit is 16+25=41, which is worse.\n\n   So the greedy assignment of each house independently to the maximum allowed by the covering restrictions is optimal.\n\n Why is that? Because the profit function is separable and the constraints are independent per house (each house's height is constrained by the restrictions that cover it). There is no interaction between houses that would allow one house to compensate for another in terms of breaking a restriction. Each restriction is a hard constraint on the entire interval. However, note: the restrictions are on intervals, and a house might appear in multiple intervals. But the condition for a house is that it must be <= the minimum of the x's of the restrictions that cover it. \n\n Since the square function is increasing, we want to set each house as high as possible. The highest we can set it is the minimum of h and the x's of the covering restrictions.\n\n Therefore, the above algorithm is correct.\n\n However, wait: what if the restrictions are conflicting in a way that the same house is constrained by two restrictions with different x's? Then we take the minimum, which is the stricter one. That is correct.\n\n Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n But note: the problem statement says that the maximum height of a house is h (global). So we must also cap at h.\n\n Example: n=1, h=5, m=1: [1,1,10] -> then we set house1 to min(5,10)=5.\n\n However, the restriction says the house must be at most 10, but the global maximum is 5, so we set to 5.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h.\" and the restrictions say the tallest house in an interval must be at most x_i. So the house must be <= min(h, x_i) for each covering restriction.\n\n So the algorithm is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   # Initialize an array for the effective maximum for each house (0-indexed, n elements)\n   arr = [h] * n   # start with the global maximum\n\n   for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n        # Convert to zero-indexed indices\n        left_index = l - 1\n        right_index = r - 1\n        # Traverse the houses from left_index to right_index\n        for i in range(left_index, right_index+1):\n            # The current house i must be at most x (and we already have a current value from previous restrictions)\n            if x < arr[i]:\n                arr[i] = x\n\n   total = 0\n   for val in arr:\n        total += val * val\n\n   print(total)\n\n Let's run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n     Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n        arr initially: [3,3,3]\n        First restriction: [0:0] -> set arr[0] = min(3,1)=1 -> [1,3,3]\n        Second: [1:1] -> set arr[1]=min(3,3)=3 -> [1,3,3]\n        Third: [2:2] -> set arr[2]=min(3,2)=2 -> [1,3,2]\n        Total: 1+9+4 = 14.\n\n Example 2:\n     Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n        arr: [10,10,10,10]\n        First restriction: [2,3] -> indices 1 to 2: set arr[1]=min(10,8)=8, arr[2]=min(10,8)=8 -> [10,8,8,10]\n        Second restriction: [3,4] -> indices 2 to 3: set arr[2]=min(8,7)=7, arr[3]=min(10,7)=7 -> [10,8,7,7]\n        Total: 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n However, wait: the second restriction is [3,4] which is indices 2 and 3 (0-indexed). \n        Initially: [10,8,8,10]\n        Then update index2: 8 vs 7 -> becomes 7; index3: 10 vs 7 -> becomes 7.\n\n So the code is correct.\n\n But note: the input might have multiple restrictions and the order might matter? Actually, no: we are updating the same array and the last update is the one that counts. However, we are taking the minimum, so the order doesn't matter. For a given house, we take the minimum of all x from the restrictions that cover it. And we update the house multiple times: each time with a new x. Since min(a,b,c) is the same regardless of order, we are effectively computing the minimum x among all restrictions covering the house.\n\n But note: we are updating the array element-by-element. However, if we update the same house multiple times, then the later update might use an already updated value (which is the minimum of previous ones) and then compare with a new x. \n\n Example: \n   Two restrictions: [1,1] with x=5 and [1,1] with x=3.\n\n   Initially: [10] (if n=1, h=10)\n   First restriction: set arr[0]=min(10,5)=5.\n   Second restriction: set arr[0]=min(5,3)=3.\n\n   This gives 3, which is the overall minimum.\n\n   Alternatively, if the order was reversed: \n        First: set to 3, then set to min(3,5)=3.\n\n   So the result is the same.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the maximum house height is h (global). We are already incorporating that by initializing with h.\n\n But wait: what if a restriction's x is greater than h? Then min(h, x) is h. \n\n Example: n=1, h=5, m=1: [1,1,10] -> then we set to min(5,10)=5.\n\n This is correct.\n\n Let me check the constraints: \n   n, h, m in [1,50] and x_i in [0,h] (so x_i cannot exceed h). \n\n Wait, the problem says: \"0 <= x_i <= h\", so x_i is at most h. Then the min(h, x_i) is just x_i if x_i <= h, but note: x_i is given to be at most h. So we can simplify: we don't need to compare with h because x_i is at most h. \n\n However, the problem says: \"0 <= x_i <= h\", so we can remove the h comparison? \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"in each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between 0 and h\". And the restrictions say the tallest house in the interval must be at most x_i. \n\n So the house must be <= min(x_i for all covering restrictions) and also <= h. But since x_i <= h, then min(x_i) <= h. Therefore, we can simply set:\n\n   arr[i] = min(arr[i], x)   [without comparing to h?] \n\n However, note: the initial value is h, and if we have a restriction with x that is less than h, then we update. But if we have no restriction, we leave as h. \n\n But the condition: the house must be at most h. So if we don't have any restriction, we set to h. \n\n However, the problem says that the house must be at most h. And the restriction says at most x_i (which is <= h). \n\n So the code can be simplified because we know x_i<=h, so the min(h, x_i) is x_i if x_i < h, and if x_i==h, then min(h,x_i)=h. But note: we are updating with x_i, so if x_i==h, then we set the house to h (same as initial). \n\n But wait: what if we have two restrictions: one with x_i=h and one with x_i= something else? \n\n Example: n=1, h=5, m=2: \n   Restriction1: [1,1] with x=5 -> set arr[0]=min(5,5)=5.\n   Restriction2: [1,1] with x=3 -> set arr[0]=min(5,3)=3.\n\n   But note: the first restriction sets to 5, then the second sets to 3.\n\n   Alternatively, if we do: \n        arr[i] = min(arr[i], x)   [without comparing to h] but we started with h=5.\n\n   Then we update with 3: 5->3.\n\n   But if we did: \n        arr[i] = min(arr[i], x)   [without comparing to h] but we started with h=5, and x=5 and then x=3, then we get 3.\n\n   However, the condition for the house is: must be <= h (5) and must be <= x_i (5 and 3). So the final value must be <= min(5,5,3)=3.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n But note: if we don't initialize with h, and we only use the restrictions, then if a house is not covered by any restriction, we would leave it as the initial value. But we are initializing with h. \n\n Since the problem says the house must be at most h, and we have no restriction, we set to h.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * n\n\n   for _ in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        l = int(data[0]); r = int(data[1]); x = int(data[2])\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x < arr[i]:\n                arr[i] = x\n\n   total = 0\n   for a in arr:\n        total += a*a\n\n   print(total)\n\n However, note: the problem input might have multiple lines of restrictions.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n        Output: 14\n\n Example 2: \n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n        Output: 262\n\n But wait: the sample input is given as two separate strings? \n\n Actually, the example input is:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   But in the problem, the input is from stdin. We are reading the first line, then the next m lines.\n\n   However, the sample input is provided as two separate examples. Our code reads from stdin.\n\n   We assume the input is given as:\n\n        First line: n, h, m\n        Then m lines, each containing three integers.\n\n   The problem says: \"Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers\"\n\n   So the code above is correct.\n\n But wait: the example input format in the problem statement is:\n\n        The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n        ... \n\n        Input\n        The first line contains three integers n, h, m ...\n        Each of the next m lines ...\n\n   So we are good.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the maximum height is h, and the restrictions' x_i are at most h. Therefore, we don't need to worry about x_i being greater than h.\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * n\n\n   for i in range(m):\n        l, r, x_val = map(int, input().split())\n        # Convert to zero-indexed\n        left_index = l-1\n        right_index = r-1\n        for j in range(left_index, right_index+1):\n            if x_val < arr[j]:\n                arr[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for a in arr:\n        total += a*a\n\n   print(total)\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say n, m, h up to 50, so this O(m*n) algorithm is efficient.\n\n But wait: what if a restriction is very large (covers almost the entire street)? Then we update many houses. But m is at most 50, and n is at most 50, so maximum operations is 50*50=2500, which is acceptable.\n\n Let's run the code with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n        arr = [3,3,3]\n        After first restriction: [1,3,3]\n        After second: [1,3,3] -> no change because 3<=3 (for the second house: 3>=3 -> no update)\n        After third: [1,3,2]\n\n        Then total = 1+9+4=14.\n\n Example 2: \n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        Restrictions: [2,3,8] and [3,4,7]\n\n        arr = [10,10,10,10]\n        After first: [10,8,8,10]   (because we update indices 1 and 2: from 10 to 8)\n        After second: [10,8,7,7]   (update indices 2 and 3: index2 becomes min(8,7)=7; index3 becomes min(10,7)=7)\n\n        Then total = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n Therefore, we output the code.\n\n However, wait: what if there are no restrictions? Then we set each house to h, and profit = n * (h*h).\n\n Example: n=2, h=3, m=0 -> [3,3] -> 9+9=18.\n\n This is correct.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and we have to read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\n Let's submit the code.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"There are m zoning restrictions\", and m can be 0.\n\n Our code handles m=0.\n\n One more edge: when x_val is 0. Then we set the house to 0. Then profit is 0.\n\n Example: n=1, h=10, m=1, restriction: [1,1,0] -> house1=0, profit=0.\n\n This is correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n But wait: the problem says the house can be built with height between 0 and h. So 0 is allowed.\n\n We are setting to 0 if a restriction says x=0.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = [h] * n\n\n   for i in range(m):\n        data = input().split()\n        l = int(data[0])\n        r = int(data[1])\n        x_val = int(data[2])\n        for j in range(l-1, r):\n            if x_val < arr[j]:\n                arr[j] = x_val\n\n   total = 0\n   for a in arr:\n        total += a*a\n\n   print(total)\n\n Let me run through the sample inputs again.\n\n Sample Input 1: \n        \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n   Output: 14\n\n Sample Input 2:\n        \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n   Output: 262\n\n But wait: the sample input is given as two separate strings in the example. How is the input provided? \n\n   In the first example: \n        Input: \n            3 3 3\n            1 1 1\n            2 2 3\n            3 3 2\n\n   Our code reads the first line as n=3, h=3, m=3, then the next three lines.\n\n   Similarly for the second example.\n\n   So the code should be correct.\n\n However, the problem says that the input is given in one go, so we must read until EOF. But in competitive programming, we read the entire input until there are no more lines.\n\n   We are using:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        for i in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n\n   This will work if the input is provided as specified.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Each of the next m lines\", so there are exactly m lines.\n\n   We'll assume the input format is correct.\n\n   Submit.\n\n But wait: the sample input in the example is provided as:\n\n        ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n   This is two separate examples. In the competition, the input is one set of data.\n\n   Our code will read one set of data.\n\n   Example: if the input is:\n\n        3 3 3\n        1 1 1\n        2 2 3\n        3 3 2\n\n   Then it outputs 14.\n\n   Then the next example is:\n\n        4 10 2\n        2 3 8\n        3 4 7\n\n   Then outputs 262.\n\n   But the problem expects two separate runs? Or is the input provided as a single string?\n\n   The problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n   And the input format is standard.\n\n   We'll write the code to read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\n   However, the example input is provided as two separate strings. But in the competition, the input is from a file or standard input, and there is only one test case.\n\n   But note: the problem says m is the number of restrictions, and then there are m lines.\n\n   The sample input has two examples. In the competition, we are to read one test case.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"You are planning to build housing on a street.\" and then describes the input.\n\n   There is no indication that there are multiple test cases.\n\n   So we assume one test case.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n However, the example input is provided as two separate strings. This might be because the problem statement shows two examples. In the competition, the input will be one block.\n\n   Example input block 1:\n\n        3 3 3\n        1 1 1\n        2 2 3\n        3 3 2\n\n   Example input block 2:\n\n        4 10 2\n        2 3 8\n        3 4 7\n\n   Our code reads one block.\n\n   Therefore, we are done",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The key challenge is to ensure that the height of each house complies with all relevant zoning restrictions, which impose maximum height limits on specific intervals of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the optimal heights for each house such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house within a certain interval must not exceed a given height. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the squares of the house heights.\n2. **Insight**: For each house, the maximum allowable height is constrained by the minimum value among the global maximum height (h) and all the heights specified in the restrictions that cover that house's position. This is because each restriction covering a house imposes an upper bound on its height, and the most restrictive (smallest) of these bounds must be respected.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves processing each restriction to update the maximum allowable height for each house within the specified interval. The initial maximum height for all houses is set to the global maximum (h). For each restriction, we iterate over the affected houses and adjust their maximum allowable height to the minimum of their current value and the restriction's specified height.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction once, and for each restriction, it updates the heights of all houses in its interval. Given that there are up to 50 houses and 50 restrictions, the total number of operations is manageable (O(m*n)), making the solution efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    arr = [h] * n\n    \n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        \n        left_index = l - 1\n        right_index = r - 1\n        \n        for j in range(left_index, right_index + 1):\n            if x_val < arr[j]:\n                arr[j] = x_val\n                \n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in arr:\n        total_profit += height * height\n        \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first three values are the number of houses (n), the global maximum height (h), and the number of restrictions (m).\n2. **Initialization**: An array `arr` is initialized with the global maximum height (h) for each house.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code determines the interval of houses affected and updates each house's maximum allowable height to the minimum of its current value and the restriction's specified height.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is computed by summing the squares of the final heights of all houses.\n5. **Output**: The total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all zoning restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the properties of the square function and careful constraint handling.",
