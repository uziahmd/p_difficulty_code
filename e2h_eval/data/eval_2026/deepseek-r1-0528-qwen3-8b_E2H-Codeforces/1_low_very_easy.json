The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The problem states that the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is a rectangle of w x h).\n Then, the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and so on.\n\n Each ring has a width of 1 cell. The i-th ring is defined for the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n But note: the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. However, we must be cautious because the problem says \"all bordering cells\".\n\n How many cells does the i-th ring have?\n Consider the outer rectangle for the i-th ring: \n   Let n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n   Let m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n The border (ring) of an n_i x m_i rectangle is:\n   Top row: m_i cells\n   Bottom row: m_i cells\n   Left and right columns: (n_i - 2) cells each (because the top and bottom rows already counted the two ends)\n\n So total for the ring: 2*m_i + 2*(n_i - 2) = 2*n_i + 2*m_i - 4.\n\n But note: if the inner rectangle has dimensions that are too small? Actually, the problem states that k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4), so that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring will have at least 3x3 (if k=1, then the next ring would be at least 3 away, but wait).\n\n However, note: the first ring is the outermost. For the first ring (i=1):\n   n_1 = w, m_1 = h\n   ring1 = 2*w + 2*h - 4\n\n Example: 3x3, k=1 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4 = 8 -> matches example.\n\n Second example: 7x9, k=1 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28 -> matches.\n\n Third example: 7x9, k=2 -> we need to compute two rings.\n\n First ring: 2*7+2*9-4 = 28\n Second ring: i=2 -> n_2 = 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4 = 3, m_2 = 9-4=5\n            ring2 = 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4 = 12\n            Total = 28+12 = 40 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, we can compute the total gilded cells by summing for i from 1 to k:\n\n   total = 0\n   for i in range(1, k+1):\n        n_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        m_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n        # Check if n_i and m_i are at least 3? Actually, the problem guarantees that k is such that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is valid (at least 3x3 for the smallest ring? Actually, the condition is that the inner rectangle for the i-th ring must have positive dimensions. But note: the problem says k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n        # However, note: for the i-th ring, the rectangle must have at least 3x3? Actually, the smallest rectangle we can form for the ring is 1x? Let's see: the ring requires a border. The formula for the border requires that the inner rectangle has at least 1x? Actually, the border is defined for the entire inner rectangle. If the inner rectangle has dimension 1x something, then the border would be just the top and bottom? But wait, the problem says: the ring has a width of 1 cell. And the example doesn't go below 3.\n\n        # According to the problem: the i-th ring is defined for the inner rectangle (w-4(i-1))x(h-4(i-1)). The ring is the border of that inner rectangle. But if the inner rectangle is 1x? then the border would have to include the entire side? Actually, the border of a 1x? rectangle doesn't make sense in the usual way. \n\n        # However, note the input constraints: k is at most floor((min(n,m)+1)/4). Let's check with the example: min(7,9)=7 -> floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2. So k=2 is allowed for 7x9. Then for the second",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells away from the previous one, moving inward. Each ring has a width of 1 cell, and the task is to compute the total number of cells covered by all the rings up to the k-th ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle. The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the i-th ring are reduced by 4*(i-1) cells in both dimensions (since each ring moves 2 cells inward on each side). \n2. **Formula Derivation**: For each ring, the number of cells can be derived by considering the perimeter of the inner rectangle. The formula for the cells in the i-th ring is `2 * (width + height) - 4`, where width and height are adjusted for the current ring.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We iterate from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring, apply the formula to find the cells in that ring, and sum them up to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if current_w <= 0 or current_h <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: the width (w), height (h), and the number of rings (k).\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize `total_cells` to zero to keep track of the cumulative number of cells gilded.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - **Adjust Dimensions**: Calculate the current dimensions of the inner rectangle by subtracting 4*(i-1) from both width and height (since each ring moves 2 cells inward on each side).\n   - **Check Validity**: If either dimension becomes non-positive, break out of the loop as further rings would not be valid.\n   - **Calculate Ring Cells**: Use the formula `2*(current_w + current_h) - 4` to compute the number of cells in the current ring. This formula accounts for the top, bottom, left, and right borders of the inner rectangle, adjusting for the corners counted twice.\n   - **Update Total**: Add the cells of the current ring to the total.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and iterative summation, ensuring correctness within the problem constraints.",
