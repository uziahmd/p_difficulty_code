He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, Ivan has given us a string of length n and 2n-2 strings (each from length 1 to n-1) which are the prefixes and suffixes of the string, but we don't know which is prefix and which is suffix.\n\n We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1. Also, they are the prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n.\n\n The problem: assign each string as either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) such that:\n   - There are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes (so total 2n-2).\n   - The set of prefixes must be the set of all prefixes of a string of length n (i.e., the prefix of length 1, then 2, ... up to n-1) and similarly for suffixes.\n\n However, note that the input order is arbitrary.\n\n Approach:\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let the original string be s (unknown) of length n.\n   Then the prefixes are: s[0:1], s[0:2], ... , s[0:n-1]\n   The suffixes are: s[1:], s[2:], ... , s[n-1:]\n\n We have 2n-2 strings (each of lengths 1 to n-1) and we know that for each length L (from 1 to n-1) there are two strings: one that is the prefix and one that is the suffix.\n\n But note: the two strings for a fixed length L might be the same? Actually, the example input \"3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na\" has two 'a' and two 'aa'. So duplicates are allowed.\n\n How can we assign?\n\n Observation:\n   The entire string s must have the following properties:\n     - The prefix of length 1 is the first character, and the suffix of length 1 is the last character.\n\n   Also, the prefix of length k must end with the suffix of length k? Not necessarily, but note that the string is fixed.\n\n   Alternatively, consider the following:\n\n   We know that the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must share an overlap condition? Actually, the entire string is fixed, so the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k+1 must have the first k characters equal to the first k characters of the string, and the last k+1 characters must have the last k characters equal to the last k of the string.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the set of given strings are the prefixes and suffixes. And we are guaranteed that there exists at least one string consistent.\n\n   Another idea: use the fact that the entire string is determined by its prefixes (or suffixes). But we don't know the assignment.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let's group the 2n-2 strings by their length. For each length L from 1 to n-1, we have two strings (possibly duplicate).\n\n   Now, we need to assign one of them as the prefix and the other as the suffix.\n\n   But note: the entire string must be consistent. For example, the prefix of length 1 must be the first character of the string, and the suffix of length 1 must be the last character.\n\n   Moreover, the prefix of length 2 must start with the first character (which is the prefix of length 1), and the suffix of length 2 must end with the last character (which is the suffix of length 1).\n\n   Also, the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must satisfy that the last min(len(prefix), len(suffix)) characters of the prefix (of length k) should match the first min(k, len(suffix)) of the suffix? Actually, no. They are independent except for the entire string.\n\n   However, we can reconstruct the entire string if we know all the prefixes. But we don't know which is which.\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   We know that the set of prefixes must form a chain: \n        p1 = s[0:1]\n        p2 = s[0:2] = p1 + s[1]\n        p3 = s[0:3] = p2 + s[2]\n\n   Similarly, the set of suffixes must form a chain (in reverse):\n        s_{n-1} = s[-1]   (last character)\n        s_{n-2} = s[1:]    (but wait, actually the suffix of length 2 is s[-2:], so the first part of this suffix must be the same as the prefix of length 2? Not exactly, but note: the entire string is fixed.\n\n   However, note: the prefix of length k must be the first k characters, and the suffix of length k must be the last k characters.\n\n   The entire string s can be built from the prefixes: if we assume we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string of length `n`. The solution involves analyzing the given strings and their relationships to form a consistent string that matches all provided prefixes and suffixes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: The input consists of `2n-2` strings, each of lengths from 1 to `n-1`. There are exactly two strings for each length. We group these strings by their lengths.\n2. **Identify First Character**: The first character of the unknown string is the prefix of length 1. Similarly, the last character is the suffix of length 1. Among the two strings of length 1, one must be the prefix (first character) and the other the suffix (last character). We can choose either, but note that the choice might affect subsequent assignments.\n3. **Determine Middle Characters**: For each length `L` from 2 to `n-1`, the prefix of length `L` must start with the prefix of length `L-1`. Similarly, the suffix of length `L` must end with the suffix of length `L-1`. Using these properties, we can identify the correct prefix and suffix for each length by checking which of the two strings matches the required starting or ending condition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    all_strings = data[1:1+2*n-2]\n    \n    groups = {}\n    for s in all_strings:\n        L = len(s)\n        if L not in groups:\n            groups[L] = []\n        groups[L].append(s)\n        \n    result_chars = []\n    assigned = set()\n    for L in range(1, n):\n        if L == 1:\n            candidates = groups[L]\n            p_candidate = None\n            s_candidate = None\n            for cand in candidates:\n                if cand not in assigned:\n                    p_candidate = cand\n                    break\n            if p_candidate is None:\n                p_candidate = candidates[0]\n            for cand in reversed(candidates):\n                if cand != p_candidate:\n                    s_candidate = cand\n                    break\n            if s_candidate is None:\n                s_candidate = candidates[0] if candidates[0] != p_candidate else candidates[1]\n            result_chars.append('P')\n            result_chars.append('S')\n            assigned.add(p_candidate)\n            assigned.add(s_candidate)\n        else:\n            p_list = groups[L]\n            found_p = None\n            found_s = None\n            for candidate in p_list:\n                if candidate in assigned:\n                    continue\n                prev_prefix = None\n                if L > 1:\n                    prev_p = None\n                    for c in groups[L-1]:\n                        if c in assigned and c.startswith(prev_prefix_str) if L-1 > 1 else True:\n                            prev_p = c\n                    if prev_p is not None and candidate.startswith(prev_p[-1]):\n                        found_p = candidate\n                        break\n                else:\n                    if candidate not in assigned:\n                        found_p = candidate\n                        break\n            if found_p is None:\n                for candidate in p_list:\n                    if candidate not in assigned:\n                        found_p = candidate\n                        break\n            \n            remaining = [x for x in p_list if x != found_p]\n            found_s = remaining[0] if remaining else None\n            \n            result_chars.append('P' if found_p is not None else 'S')\n            result_chars.append('S' if found_s is not None else 'P')\n            assigned.add(found_p) if found_p else None\n            assigned.add(found_s) if found_s else None\n\n    output_str = ''.join(result_chars)\n    print(output_str)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into individual lines. The first line is the length `n` of the unknown string, followed by `2n-2` strings representing possible prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Grouping Strings**: Strings are grouped by their lengths into a dictionary where keys are lengths (from 1 to `n-1`) and values are lists of strings of that length.\n3. **Assigning Prefixes and Suffixes**: \n   - For length 1, the two strings are directly assigned as 'P' (prefix) and 'S' (suffix) since they must be the first and last characters of the unknown string.\n   - For lengths greater than 1, the prefix must start with the previous prefix, and the suffix must end with the next suffix. By checking these conditions, we determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n4. **Output**: The results are compiled into a string of 'P's and 'S's indicating the assignment of each input string, which is then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of prefixes and suffixes to determine their assignments, ensuring consistency with the unknown string's structure.",
