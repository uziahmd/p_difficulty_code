And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and k.\n Then, read the next line which contains n integers.\n\n There are (n - k + 1) weeks. For each week, we take k consecutive days and compute the average for that week.\n Then we are to output the overall average of these averages? But note: the example input [3,4,7] with k=2 and n=3 gives two weeks: [3,4] and [4,7]. The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, for the second week (4+7)/2 = 5.5. Then the overall average is (3.5+5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? But wait, the example output is 9.0000000000.\n\n Let me check the example again: \n Input: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n The example says: then the result is 9.0000000000.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"calculate average sleeping time over all weeks.\" \n\n But note: there are two weeks. The total sleep over all weeks is (3+4) + (4+7) = 3+4+4+7 = 18. And there are two weeks? Then the average per week would be 18 / 2 = 9.0.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be interpreted as: \n   total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} [sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} a_j]\n   Then the average = total_sleep / (number_of_weeks * k) ? \n\n However, note the example: \n   In the third example: \n        Input: 8 2\n               1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n        Output: 28964.2857142857\n\n But wait, let's break down the third example:\n\n        n=8, k=2 -> number of weeks = 7.\n        The weeks are: [1,2], [2,4], [4,100000], [100000,123], [123,456], [456,789], [789,1]\n\n        Total sleep = 1+2 + 2+4 + 4+100000 + 100000+123 + 123+456 + 456+789 + 789+1\n                   = 3 + 6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 1245\n\n        Let me calculate step by step:\n          3 + 6 = 9\n          9 + 100004 = 100013\n          100013 + 100123 = 200136\n          200136 + 579 = 200715\n          200715 + 1245 = 201960\n          201960 + 1245 = 203205\n\n        Then if we divide by the number of weeks (7) we get 203205 / 7 = 29029.2857142857... but that does not match the sample output.\n\n        Alternatively, if we consider the entire week's sleep and then average over all weeks, but note: the average for a week is the total sleep in that week divided by k (which is 2). \n\n        Then the overall average is the average of (average1, average2, ..., average7).\n\n        But note: the problem says \"the average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks\". This could be interpreted as the average of the weekly averages.\n\n        However, observe: \n          Week1: (1+2)/2 = 1.5\n          Week2: (2+4)/2 = 3\n          Week3: (4+100000)/2 = 50002\n          Week4: (100000+123)/2 = 50061.5\n          Week5: (123+456)/2 = 289.5\n          Week6: (456+789)/2 = 622.5\n          Week7: (789+1)/2 = 395\n\n        Now, the average of these weekly averages: \n          (1.5 + 3 + 50002 + 50061.5 + 289.5 + 622.5 + 395) / 7\n\n        Let's add them up:\n          1.5 + 3 = 4.5\n          4.5 + 50002 = 50006.5\n          50006.5 + 50061.5 = 100068\n          100068 + 289.5 = 100357.5\n          100357.5 + 622.5 = 100980\n          100980 + 395 = 101375\n\n        Then 101375 / 7 ≈ 14482.142857... but the sample output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be asking for the average sleep time per day, averaged over the entire week set?\n\n        But note: the example output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n        Another interpretation: Instead of averaging the weekly averages, we can think of the entire dataset as having a total of (n-k+1)*k days? No, because each week is k days, so total days is (n-k+1)*k? That doesn't make sense because the same day is repeated.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\" for each week, and then we are to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n        However, note: the example output for the third example is 28964.2857142857.\n\n        Let me recalc the total sleep and then divide by the total number of days? \n\n        Total sleep is 203205 (from above) and the total days considered is 7*2 = 14, so average per day is 203205/14 ≈ 14514.642857... which is not 28964.\n\n        Wait, what if we do: the average per week is the total sleep for that week divided by k, then we average the weekly averages.\n\n        But wait: the average of the weekly averages is the same as the total sleep divided by (k * number_of_weeks)? \n\n        Because: \n          total_sleep = (week1_total + week2_total + ... + weekm_total)\n          Each week i has average_i = week_i_total / k.\n          Then average of the averages = (week1_total/k + week2_total/k + ...) / m\n                                 = (total_sleep) / (k * m)\n\n        Here, m = n-k+1 = 7, k=2, so total_sleep / (k*m) = 203205 / (2*7) = 203205 / 14 ≈ 14514.642857...\n\n        But the sample output is 28964.2857142857.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe they want the average of the weekly totals? \n\n        Then: total_sleep / m = 203205 / 7 ≈ 29029.285714... which is close to 28964? Not really.\n\n        Let me recalculate the total_sleep from the given array [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1] for k=2:\n\n          Week1: 1+2 = 3\n          Week2: 2+4 = 6\n          Week3: 4+100000 = 100004\n          Week4: 100000+123 = 100123\n          Week5: 123+456 = 579\n          Week6: 456+789 = 1245\n          Week7: 789+1 = 790\n\n        So total_sleep = 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = \n          3+6=9\n          9+100004=100013\n          100013+100123=200136\n          200136+579=200715\n          200715+1245=201960\n          201960+790=202750\n\n        Then if we do: total_sleep / (number_of_weeks) = 202750 / 7 ≈ 28964.2857142857, which matches the sample output.\n\n        Therefore, the problem is: \n          We have n-k+1 weeks. Each week is k consecutive days. \n          The total sleep is the sum of all the numbers in the array that appear in any week? But note: the same day may appear in multiple weeks? Actually, no: the weeks are consecutive and non-overlapping? \n\n        But wait, the example: \n          Days: [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8] for n=8, k=2.\n          Week1: [a1, a2] -> uses a1 and a2.\n          Week2: [a2, a3] -> uses a2 and a3.\n          Week3: [a3, a4] -> uses a3 and a4.\n\n        So the same day appears in multiple weeks. In fact, the first day (a1) appears only in week1, the second (a2) appears in week1 and week2, and so on.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\", and then we are to compute the average over all weeks.\n\n        But note: the example output is 28964.2857142857, which is the total_sleep (which is the sum of all the numbers in the array, but each day is counted as many times as the number of weeks it appears in) divided by the number of weeks.\n\n        How many times is each day counted?\n          Day i (0-indexed) is included in the weeks starting from i down to i-(k-1) (if we consider negative indices then we use max(0, ...))? Actually, the day i is included in the weeks that start from max(0, i-k+1) to min(i, n-k) (but easier: the day i is included in the weeks that end from i to i+k-1, but the week must be within [0, n-k] (weeks are from index0 to index n-k)).\n\n        Alternatively, note that the total_sleep is the sum of each element multiplied by the number of weeks it appears.\n\n        For an element at position i (0-indexed), how many weeks include it?\n          The week starts at j (0-indexed) and goes from j to j+k-1.\n          Condition: j <= i <= j+k-1  => j is in [max(0, i-k+1), min(i, n-k)]? \n\n        Actually, j must satisfy: j <= i and j >= i - k + 1, and also j from 0 to n-k (inclusive). So the number of weeks that include day i is:\n          count_i = min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1   ??? \n\n        But wait, let me check for i=0 (first day): \n          j must be 0, and the condition: 0<=0<=0+k-1 -> true. So count_0=1.\n\n        For i=1: j must be 0 or 1? But week0: [0, k-1] includes i=1 if k>=2. Week1: [1, 1+k-1] includes i=1. So if n-k>=1, then two weeks.\n\n        Actually, the condition for a fixed i: \n          j <= i and j>= i-k+1, and j from 0 to n-k (inclusive). So the lower bound is L = max(0, i-k+1) and the upper bound is U = min(i, n-k). Then count_i = max(0, U - L + 1).\n\n        Example for n=8, k=2, i=0: L = max(0,0-2+1)=max(0,-1)=0, U=min(0,8-2)=min(0,6)=0 -> count0=1.\n        i=1: L=max(0,1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0, U=min(1,6)=1 -> count1=2.\n        i=2: L=max(0,2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1, U=min(2,6)=2 -> count2=2.\n        i=3: L=max(0,3-2+1)=max(0,2)=2, U=min(3,6)=3 -> count3=2.\n        i=4: L=max(0,4-2+1)=3, U=min(4,6)=4 -> count4=2.\n        i=5: L=max(0,5-2+1)=4, U=min(5,6)=5 -> count5=2.\n        i=6: L=max(0,6-2+1)=5, U=min(6,6)=6 -> count6=2.\n        i=7: L=max(0,7-2+1)=6, U=min(7,6)=6 -> count7=1.\n\n        Then total_sleep = a0*1 + a1*2 + a2*2 + a3*2 + a4*2 + a5*2 + a6*2 + a7*1.\n\n        Now, using the array [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]:\n          = 1*1 + 2*2 + 4*2 + 100000*2 + 123*2 + 456*2 + 789*2 + 1*1\n          = 1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1\n          = 1+4=5; 5+8=13; 13+200000=200013; 200013+246=200259; 200259+912=201171; 201171+1578=202749; 202749+1=202750.\n\n        Then the average over the weeks is total_sleep / (n-k+1) = 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        So the problem is: \n          total_sleep = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a[i] * (number of weeks that include day i))\n          Then answer = total_sleep / (n-k+1)\n\n        How to compute the counts for each day without iterating over each week and each day (which would be O(n*k))?\n\n        We note that the count for day i is determined by:\n          L_i = max(0, i - k + 1)\n          R_i = min(i, n-k)   [since the last week starts at n-k (because the last week ends at n-1, and starts at n-k)]\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a difference array to mark the starts and ends of the intervals during which the day is included.\n\n        But note: the day i is included in weeks that start from j = max(0, i-k+1) to j = min(i, n-k). \n\n        We can also think: \n          The first week that includes day i is when j <= i and j>= i-k+1, so the smallest j is max(0, i-k+1). The largest j is min(i, n-k).\n\n        Then the count for day i is: \n          count_i = max(0, min(i, n-k) - max(0, i-k+1) + 1)\n\n        But note: if i < k-1, then max(0, i-k+1) = 0, and min(i, n-k) = i, so count_i = i - 0 + 1 = i+1.\n        If i >= k-1, then max(0, i-k+1) = i-k+1, and min(i, n-k) = min(i, n-k). Then count_i = min(i, n-k) - (i-k+1) + 1 = min(i, n-k) - i + k.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: if i >= n-k+1? Actually, the condition for the upper bound is min(i, n-k). Since i runs from 0 to n-1, and n-k is the last week start index (which is n-k, and since k<=n, n-k>=0). \n\n        But note: i can be greater than n-k. Then min(i, n-k) = n-k. Then count_i = n-k - (i-k+1) + 1 = n-k - i + k = n - i.\n\n        So we can break it into three cases? Or use:\n\n          count_i = min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k-i+1+k?) -> Actually, let's derive:\n\n          We have two constraints: \n            j <= i and j >= i-k+1, and j in [0, n-k].\n\n          The valid j are from L = max(0, i-k+1) to R = min(i, n-k). Then count_i = max(0, R - L + 1).\n\n        We can compute this for each i in O(1). Since n can be up to 200000, we can do a loop of n and compute the total_sleep in O(n).\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Read n, k and the list a of n integers.\n\n          Let m = n - k + 1   (number of weeks)\n\n          total_sleep = 0.0\n          for i in range(n):\n              L = max(0, i - k + 1)\n              R = min(i, m-1)   # Wait, note: the week starts index goes from 0 to m-1 (because there are m = n-k+1 weeks). But note: the week starting at j uses days j to j+k-1. The last week starts at j = n-k (which is m-1) because m = n-k+1.\n\n          However, note: the condition for the week j is that j must be <= i and j>= i-k+1, and j must be in [0, m-1] (because there are m weeks, indexed 0 to m-1). \n\n          But note: the condition for including day i is j <= i and j>= i-k+1, and j must be at least 0 and at most m-1.\n\n          So we should set:\n            L = max(0, i-k+1)\n            R = min(m-1, i)   # because j cannot exceed m-1 and j must be <= i.\n\n          Then count_i = max(0, R - L + 1)   [if R < L, then 0]\n\n          Then total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n\n          Then average = total_sleep / m\n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, m=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\n          i=0: L = max(0,0-2+1)=0, R = min(1,0)=0 -> count0=1 -> 3*1=3\n          i=1: L = max(0,1-2+1)=0, R = min(1,1)=1 -> count1=2 -> 4*2=8\n          i=2: L = max(0,2-2+1)=1, R = min(1,2)=1 -> count2=1 -> 7*1=7\n\n          total_sleep = 3+8+7 = 18\n          average = 18 / 2 = 9.0 -> matches.\n\n        So the code:\n\n          n, k = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          m = n - k + 1   # number of weeks\n\n          total_sleep = 0.0\n          for i in range(n):\n              # The valid week indices j must be in [L, R] where L = max(0, i-k+1) and R = min(m-1, i)\n              L = max(0, i - k + 1)\n              R = min(m-1, i)\n              if R < L:\n                  count_i = 0\n              else:\n                  count_i = R - L + 1\n              total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n\n          average = total_sleep / m\n          # Format the output to have 10 decimal places as in the example.\n\n        However, note: the example input \"1 1\\n10\" -> n=1, k=1, m=1.\n          i=0: L = max(0,0-1+1)=0, R = min(0,0)=0 -> count0=1, total_sleep=10, average=10/1=10.0.\n\n        But wait: the above calculation for the third example: \n          n=8, k=2, m=7.\n          i=0: L=0, R=min(6,0)=0 -> count0=1 -> a[0]=1 -> 1\n          i=1: L=0, R=min(6,1)=1 -> count1=2 -> 2*2=4\n          i=2: L=1, R=min(6,2)=2 -> count2=2 -> 4*2=8\n          i=3: L=2, R=min(6,3)=3 -> count3=2 -> 100000*2=200000\n          i=4: L=3, R=min(6,4)=4 -> count4=2 -> 123*2=246\n          i=5: L=4, R=min(6,5)=5 -> count5=2 -> 456*2=912\n          i=6: L=5, R=min(6,6)=6 -> count6=2 -> 789*2=1578\n          i=7: L=6, R=min(6,7)=6 -> count7=1 -> 1\n\n          total_sleep = 1+4+8+200000+246+912+1578+1 = 1+4=5; 5+8=13; 13+200000=200013; 200013+246=200259; 200259+912=201171; 201171+1578=202749; 202749+1=202750.\n\n          Then average = 202750/7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        So the code works.\n\n        However, note: the above formula for R is min(m-1, i). But wait, the condition for the week j is j<=i. But note: j must be at most m-1 (which is n-k). Also, j must be at most i (because j<=i). So R = min(m-1, i) is correct.\n\n        But note: the week j is defined by j from 0 to m-1 (inclusive). And j must be <= i, so the maximum j we can use is the minimum between i and m-1.\n\n        Let me test with n=5, k=3, then m=3. \n          Days: 0,1,2,3,4.\n          Week0: [0,1,2]\n          Week1: [1,2,3]\n          Week2: [2,3,4]\n\n          For day0: only week0 -> count0=1 -> L = max(0,0-3+1)=max(0,-2)=0, R = min(2,0)=0 -> 1.\n          For day1: week0 and week1 -> count1=2 -> L = max(0,1-3+1)=0, R=min(2,1)=1 -> 2.\n          For day2: week0, week1, week2 -> count2=3 -> L = max(0,2-3+1)=0, R=min(2,2)=2 -> 3.\n          For day3: week1, week2 -> count3=2 -> L = max(0,3-3+1)=1, R=min(2,3)=2 -> 2.\n          For day4: week2 -> count4=1 -> L = max(0,4-3+1)=2, R=min(2,4)=2 -> 1.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        But note: the above method uses a loop and computes each day's count in O(1). The total complexity is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 200000.\n\n        However, we can also use a different approach: we note that the count for day i is:\n\n          count_i = min(i+1, n-i, k, n-k-i+1+k) ? \n\n        Actually, we can also use a two-pass method with a sliding window, but the above direct computation is simple.\n\n        But wait: the above formula for R is using m-1, which is n-k. We can write:\n\n          R = min(i, n-k)   [since m-1 = n-k]\n\n        But wait: the condition for j is j<=i and j<=n-k (because j from 0 to n-k). So yes, R = min(i, n-k).\n\n        So we can write:\n\n          L = max(0, i-k+1)\n          R = min(i, n-k)   # because j cannot exceed n-k (the last week starts at n-k)\n\n        Then count_i = max(0, R - L + 1)\n\n        Let me verify with the example n=5, k=3, i=3: \n          L = max(0,3-3+1)=1, R = min(3,5-3)=min(3,2)=2 -> count3=2, correct.\n\n        So the code becomes:\n\n          n, k = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          m = n - k + 1   # number of weeks\n\n          total_sleep = 0.0\n          for i in range(n):\n              L = max(0, i - k + 1)\n              R = min(i, n - k)   # because the last week starts at index n-k (and we have m = n-k+1 weeks, so indices 0 to n-k)\n              if R < L:\n                  count_i = 0\n              else:\n                  count_i = R - L + 1\n              total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n\n          average = total_sleep / m\n\n        However, note: the condition for the week j is that j must be at least 0 and at most n-k (so j in [0, n-k]). The above R = min(i, n-k) is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if n-k is negative? But k<=n, so n-k>=0.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n          n=3, k=2, m=2\n          i0: L = max(0,0-2+1)=0, R = min(0,3-2)=min(0,1)=0 -> count0=1, add 3.\n          i1: L = max(0,1-2+1)=0, R = min(1,1)=1 -> count1=2, add 4*2=8 -> total=11\n          i2: L = max(0,2-2+1)=1, R = min(2,1)=1 -> count2=1, add 7 -> total=18, average=18/2=9.\n\n        Example2: \"1 1\\n10\"\n          n=1,k=1,m=1\n          i0: L = max(0,0-1+1)=0, R=min(0,1-1)=min(0,0)=0 -> count0=1, total=10, average=10.\n\n        Example3: \"8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\"\n          We did above and got 202750, then 202750/7=28964.2857142857...\n\n        However, note: the example input in the problem is given as:\n          ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n        And the expected outputs are:\n          ['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n        But wait, the sample output for the third example is '28964.2857142857'. Our calculation: 202750/7 = 28964.2857142857... exactly.\n\n        However, note: 202750 // 7 = 28964 with remainder 2, so 28964 + 2/7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\n        We need to output the average with 10 decimal places.\n\n        We can use formatting:\n\n          print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n        But note: the example output for 9 is \"9.0000000000\", so we must format to have 10 digits after the decimal.\n\n        However, the problem says: absolute or relative error <= 1e-6, so 10 digits is safe.\n\n        Let me test with 9.0: \n          \"{:.10f}\".format(9.0) -> '9.0000000000'\n\n        So the code:\n\n          n, k = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          m = n - k + 1\n          total_sleep = 0.0\n          for i in range(n):\n              L = max(0, i - k + 1)\n              R = min(i, n - k)\n              if R >= L:\n                  total_sleep += a[i] * (R - L + 1)\n              # else, nothing\n\n          average = total_sleep / m\n          print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n        But wait: what if m==0? The problem states k>=1 and n>=k, so m = n-k+1 >= 1.\n\n        This should be safe.\n\n        However, note: the condition for R>=L: if R < L, then we skip (count=0). But note that if i < k-1, then L=0, and R = min(i, n-k). Since i < k-1, and k>=1, then i<k-1 means i<=k-2. Then R = i (if i <= n-k) or n-k (if i>n-k). But note: if i < k-1, then we are in the first few days, so the count is i+1 (if n-k >= i) or n-k+1 - i + ...? Actually, our formula still holds.\n\n        But wait: what if n-k is less than i? Then R = n-k. Then L = max(0, i-k+1). Then count_i = n-k - (i-k+1) + 1 = n-k - i + k = n - i.\n\n        Example: n=5, k=3, i=3: \n          n-k=2, i=3, then R = min(3,2)=2, L = max(0,3-3+1)=1, then count=2-1+1=2.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        One more: n=5, k=3, i=4: \n          L = max(0,4-3+1)=2, R = min(4,2)=2, count=1.\n\n        But wait, for i=4, we are the last day. In the example n=5, k=3: \n          Week0: [0,1,2]\n          Week1: [1,2,3]\n          Week2: [2,3,4]\n          So day4 (index4) is only in week2. So count=1, correct.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the above formula for R uses n-k, which is the last week start index (since week0 starts at0, week1 at1, ... week_{n-k} starts at n-k). And we have m = n-k+1, so the last week index is n-k (which is m-1).\n\n        We can run the code and see.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints are large (n up to 200000). The above loop is O(n) and efficient.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the condition for R is actually the minimum between i and n-k. Why? Because the week j must be <= i and j must be <= n-k (since the last week is at n-k). \n\n        But wait, the week j is defined by j from 0 to n-k (inclusive). So the condition is j <= n-k and j<=i. Therefore, R = min(i, n-k).\n\n        But note: the week j must also be at least 0, and we already set L to be at least 0.\n\n        We are good.\n\n        Code:\n\n          n, k = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          m = n - k + 1\n          total_sleep = 0.0\n          for i in range(n):\n              L = max(0, i - k + 1)\n              R = min(i, n - k)   # because the week index j must be <= n-k (the last week starts at n-k) and j<=i.\n              if R >= L:\n                  total_sleep += a[i] * (R - L + 1)\n          average = total_sleep / m\n          print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\n        However, wait: the above R is defined as min(i, n-k). But note: the week",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time of Polycarp over all possible weeks in a given sequence of sleep records. Each week is defined as k consecutive days, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks in the sequence. The challenge is to efficiently compute the total sleep time across all weeks and then determine the average sleep time per week.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires processing a sequence of sleep records and calculating the average sleep time over all possible sliding windows of size k. Each window represents a week, and the average for each week is the sum of sleep times in that week divided by k. However, the final output is the average of these weekly averages, which simplifies to the total sleep time across all weeks divided by the number of weeks (n - k + 1).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Instead of processing each week individually (which would be inefficient for large n), we recognize that each day's sleep time is included in multiple weeks. Specifically, a day at position i is included in weeks that start from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(i, n - k). The count of such weeks for each day i can be computed directly, allowing us to accumulate the total sleep time by iterating through each day once.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Reading the input values for n (number of days), k (window size), and the list of sleep times.\n   - For each day i, compute the range of weeks that include it (L to R).\n   - Multiply the sleep time of day i by the number of weeks it appears in (R - L + 1) and accumulate this value.\n   - Divide the total accumulated sleep time by the number of weeks (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each day exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints (n ≤ 2·10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    m = n - k + 1\n    total_sleep = 0.0\n    for i in range(n):\n        L = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        R = min(i, n - k)\n        if R >= L:\n            count_i = R - L + 1\n        else:\n            count_i = 0\n        total_sleep += a[i] * count_i\n    average = total_sleep / m\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days (n), the window size (k), and the list of sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initialization**: The number of weeks (m) is calculated as (n - k + 1). A variable `total_sleep` is initialized to accumulate the sum of sleep times across all weeks.\n3. **Processing Each Day**: For each day i:\n   - **Determine Valid Weeks (L to R)**: The start (L) of the first week including day i is max(0, i - k + 1), and the end (R) is min(i, n - k). This ensures we only consider valid weeks within the sequence.\n   - **Count Weeks Including Day i**: If R is greater than or equal to L, the day is included in (R - L + 1) weeks; otherwise, it's not included.\n   - **Accumulate Sleep Time**: The sleep time of day i is multiplied by the number of weeks it appears in and added to `total_sleep`.\n4. **Calculate Average**: The average sleep time per week is obtained by dividing `total_sleep` by the number of weeks (m).\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired average by leveraging direct calculation of each day's contribution, avoiding the need for nested loops and ensuring optimal performance.",
