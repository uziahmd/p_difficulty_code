He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s. Since there are usually more 2s than 5s, we count the number of 5s.\n\n The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n Now, we are given an integer m (from 1 to 100000) and we want to find all positive integers n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n Observation:\n   The function Z(n) is non-decreasing. For example:\n     Z(0)=0, Z(1)=0, Z(2)=0, Z(3)=0, Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, ... until Z(9)=1, then Z(10)=2, etc.\n\n   But note: the sample input m=1 gives output 5\\n5 6 7 8 9.\n\n   We cannot have two consecutive n's with the same Z(n) value? Actually, no: we can have a run of consecutive numbers with the same Z(n). In fact, the value Z(n) increases only when n is a multiple of a power of 5.\n\n   However, note that the problem does not ask for the n's that yield at least m zeros, but exactly m zeros.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Find the range of n for which Z(n) = m.\n\n   How?\n   - First, we need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m. But note: we want exactly m.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds for n where Z(n) = m.\n\n   Let f(n) = Z(n)\n\n   We know that:\n     There exists an n_min such that f(n_min) = m and for all n < n_min, f(n) < m.\n     There exists an n_max such that f(n_max) = m and for all n > n_max, f(n) > m? Not necessarily: actually, we might have a gap.\n\n   Actually, the problem states: \"exactly m zeroes\". So we are looking for all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   However, note that f(n) is constant over intervals. For example, once we reach a value m, it will stay at m until we hit the next multiple of 5 (or higher power) that adds one or more zeros.\n\n   But wait: the trailing zeros are added only when we multiply by a number that contributes one or more factors of 5 (and enough 2s). So the function f(n) is stepwise increasing.\n\n   Example: \n      m=1: n from 5 to 9 -> because at 5 we get 1, and then until 9 we still have 1 (since 10 would add one more).\n\n   How to find the range?\n\n   We can find:\n      Let L(m) be the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n      Let R(m) be the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1.\n\n   Then, the set of n with Z(n)=m is [L(m), R(m)-1] (if L(m) < R(m)).\n\n   However, what if there is no n such that Z(n)=m? Then the set is empty.\n\n   But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000, and we know that Z(n) is defined for all n and grows without bound. However, sometimes there might be gaps. For example, is there any m that is skipped?\n\n   Example: \n      Z(0)=0, Z(1)=0, ... Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, ... Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2, Z(11)=2, ... Z(14)=2, Z(15)=3, etc.\n\n   So the values of Z(n) are non-decreasing and they increase by at least 1 at each multiple of 5, but sometimes by more (if the number is divisible by 25, then we add two, etc.). Therefore, it is possible that some m are skipped.\n\n   Example: \n      Consider m=0: then n from 0 to 4. But the problem says positive integers n, so n starts at 1. However, the problem says m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of \\( n \\) values that meet the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 5 in \\( n! \\). This count can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Finding the Range for \\( n \\)**:\n   - **Lower Bound (L)**: The smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound (R)**: The smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m + 1 \\).\n   The valid \\( n \\) values are those in the interval \\([L, R-1]\\), provided \\( L < R \\). If no such \\( n \\) exists, the answer is an empty list.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: Given the constraints (m up to 100,000), a linear search would be inefficient. Instead, we use binary search to quickly find the bounds \\( L \\) and \\( R \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        return\n    \n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (m + 1) + 1\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            \n    L = low\n    \n    high = 5 * (m + 1) * 2 + 1\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m + 1:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            \n    R = low\n    \n    if L >= R:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = R - L\n        print(k)\n        numbers = [str(i) for i in range(L, R)]\n        print(' '.join(numbers))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**:\n   - **Finding \\( L \\)**: The lower bound \\( L \\) is found using binary search where the search space is adjusted based on whether the midpoint value's trailing zeroes are less than \\( m \\).\n   - **Finding \\( R \\)**: Similarly, the upper bound \\( R \\) is found by searching for the smallest \\( n \\) where the trailing zeroes exceed \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Output**: If \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) are valid (i.e., \\( L < R \\)), the solution outputs the count of numbers from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\) and lists them. If no such numbers exist, it outputs 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search, making it suitable for large values of \\( m \\) up to 100,000.",
