Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum value.\n Since the instability is defined as (max - min), we note that if we remove an element, the new instability is:\n   max_remaining - min_remaining\n\n The key observation: \n   The original array has a global min (let's call it `min_val`) and global max (`max_val`).\n\n If we remove an element that is not the current min or max, then the min and max of the remaining array remain the same.\n\n However, if we remove the only occurrence of the global min, then the new min becomes the next smallest number (which is at least `min_val` but we don't have it anymore).\n Similarly, if we remove the only occurrence of the global max, then the new max becomes the next largest number.\n\n But note: there could be duplicates. So we cannot simply remove one occurrence and assume the min or max changes.\n\n Approach:\n\n 1. Sort the array and also keep track of the frequency? Actually, we can do:\n\n Idea: \n   Let b = sorted(a)\n\n Then, if we remove an element, we can consider two types of removals that would change the min or max:\n\n   Type 1: Removing an element that is the current global min (if we remove one occurrence of the first element in b, then the new min is the second element in b, unless there are duplicates).\n   Type 2: Removing an element that is the current global max (if we remove one occurrence of the last element in b, then the new max is the second last element in b, unless there are duplicates).\n\n However, note that sometimes we might have multiple duplicates. \n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider that after removal, the instability is determined by the new min and new max.\n\n The new min can be:\n   - If we remove an element that is the smallest, then the new min is the next smallest (which is the second smallest in the sorted array, unless there are multiple smallest)\n   - Similarly, the new max is the next largest if we remove the largest.\n\n But note: what if we remove an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest? Then the min and max remain the same.\n\n Therefore, the candidate instabilities are:\n\n   Candidate 1: Remove the smallest element -> instability = b[n-1] - b[1]\n   Candidate 2: Remove the largest element -> instability = b[n-2] - b[0]\n\n However, wait: what if the array has duplicates? For example, [1,1,3,7]:\n   Original: min=1, max=7, instability=6.\n   If we remove one of the 1's: then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6.\n   But if we remove the 3: [1,1,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6.\n   If we remove the 7: [1,1,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n So the above two candidates are not sufficient.\n\n Actually, the idea is: we can try to remove each occurrence of the minimum or maximum, but note that if there are multiple minimums, then removing one minimum doesn't change the min? \n\n Let me break down:\n\n   Case 1: Removing an element that is the minimum (but not necessarily the first occurrence) \n        - The new min will be the next distinct value? Actually, no: if there are multiple minimums, then the min remains the same until we remove all of them.\n\n   Actually, we can consider:\n\n   Let the sorted array be b.\n\n   We are allowed to remove one element. Then the new min is the smallest element in the array, which is the first element of the array that is not removed.\n\n   Similarly, the new max is the last element of the array that is not removed.\n\n   So, we can consider two pointers or sliding window? Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   We want to minimize (max_remaining - min_remaining). \n\n   Note: The entire array without one element must have at least one element from the left part (min side) and one from the right part (max side). \n\n   However, note: we are only removing one element.\n\n   Another idea: we can try to consider every removal and compute the instability, but that would be O(n) and for each removal we need to find min and max (which is O(n) each) -> too slow.\n\n   Instead, we can note:\n\n   The instability after removal is:\n\n        instability = max(b without x) - min(b without x)\n\n   But we can precompute the min and max of the entire array. However, when we remove an element, the min and max might change only if the removed element is the current min or max.\n\n   Actually, the min of the remaining array",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the potential new minima and maxima after removing an element.\n2. **Key Insight**: Removing an element from the array can only affect the current minimum or maximum if that element is the smallest or largest in the original array. If duplicates exist, removing one instance might not change the min or max.\n3. **Candidate Instabilities**: The minimal instability can be derived by considering two scenarios:\n   - **Removing the smallest element**: The new instability is the difference between the original maximum and the next smallest element.\n   - **Removing the largest element**: The new instability is the difference between the next largest element and the original minimum.\n4. **Edge Cases**: If the array has all elements the same, removing any element results in zero instability. Otherwise, the minimal instability is the smaller of the two candidate values obtained above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)\n    \n    candidate1 = sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[1]\n    candidate2 = sorted_arr[-2] - sorted_arr[0]\n    \n    answer = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n    \n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only one element (though the problem constraints ensure `n >= 2`), it directly returns 0.\n3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n4. **Candidate Calculation**: \n   - `candidate1` calculates the instability if the smallest element is removed (difference between the largest element and the next smallest).\n   - `candidate2` calculates the instability if the largest element is removed (difference between the next largest element and the smallest element).\n5. **Result Determination**: The minimal instability is the smaller of the two candidates, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking two critical scenarios, leveraging sorting for optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
