He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that the string only contains 'a','b','c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends some number of 'c' (which is either the count of 'a' OR the count of 'b' OR both, but note: the process requires that the original string from A and B has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends c's equal to the current count of 'a' or the current count of 'b' (which includes the original a's and the b's appended by B).\n\n However, note the process:\n   - A gives a string of some number of 'a's (at least one).\n   - B appends some number of 'b's (at least one) -> so the string has a part of only 'a's then only 'b's.\n   - Then C appends some number of 'c's which is equal to the total count of 'a' (from A) OR the total count of 'b' (from B) in the string at that time (which is the entire string after B's appending). But note: the entire string after B has all the 'a's and all the 'b's.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". The string here is the one after B's appending (so including the original a's and the b's). \n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"aaabccc\" -> YES because the number of 'c' (which is 3) equals the number of 'a' (which is 3). \n\n Also, the example \"aabc\": \n   Count of 'a': 2, 'b':1, 'c':1 -> condition: the number of 'c' must be either 2 or 1. Here it is 1, so it matches the count of 'b'. So YES.\n\n But what about the order? The problem states that:\n   - The string must start with one or more 'a's, then one or more 'b's, then one or more 'c's? Actually, note the process: \n        A gives a string of 'a's (so consecutive a's at the beginning)\n        Then B appends some 'b's (so after the a's, we get b's)\n        Then C appends some 'c's (so after the b's, we get c's)\n\n Therefore, the entire string should be divided into three contiguous parts: [a's] [b's] [c's]. And importantly, there should be no mixing.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if the string has the form: zero or more 'a's, then one or more 'b's, then one or more 'c's? But note: the problem says that the string given to B is the one with a's and then b's (so the a's are at the beginning and then b's, and then c's at the end). However, note that the problem does not say that the entire string must have only these characters, but it is guaranteed that the string consists of 'a','b','c'.\n\n 2. However, the example \"bbacc\": \n        This string: 'b','b','a','c','c'\n        Why is it NO?\n        Because the string must have the a's first, then b's, then c's. In \"bbacc\", we have two b's, then an a, which breaks the order.\n\n 3. So the conditions are:\n    Condition 1: The string must be non-decreasing in the sense of having all 'a's (if any) then all 'b's then all 'c's. But note: it is possible that the string doesn't have a particular letter. However, the problem states that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string (after B's appending) and then C appends c's. But wait, what if the string doesn't have a 'c'? Then the condition for C's appending would require that the number of c's is either the count of a or the count of b, but if there are no c's then the condition fails (unless the counts of a and b are zero, but they can't be because we have at least one a and one b). However, note: the problem says that C appends some number of c's. That means the final string must have at least one c? Not necessarily: the problem says \"some number\" meaning at least one? Actually, the problem says \"appends some number\", and in programming problems \"some number\" usually means at least one. But note: the condition also says \"It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both\", so if the string has no 'c', then the condition fails.\n\n    However, note the example: the input string might not have any 'c'? Then we must check.\n\n 4. But wait: the problem says \"B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" So the final string must have the same number of a and b as the one given to C, plus the appended c's. Therefore, the original string (before C) must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends at least one 'c'? Actually, the problem says \"some number\", which in competitive programming often implies at least one. However, the problem statement also says \"equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b'\", so if the number of a is 0 or the number of b is 0, then we cannot have a positive c? But the problem states that after B's appending, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the string we are given must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and the c's appended must be at least one (because the condition says \"some number\" meaning at least one, and the count is either the count of a or the count of b, which are positive). \n\n    However, let me re-read: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string\". The word \"some\" typically implies at least one. Therefore, the final string must contain at least one 'c'.\n\n 5. So the steps:\n\n    Step 1: Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. (But wait: what if the string doesn't have a 'c'? Then it's invalid.)\n\n    Step 2: Check the order: the string should be such that the letters are in non-decreasing order (i.e., all 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's). However, note that the problem does not require that all three letters are present. But the problem states that after B's appending, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends c's. So the final string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Therefore, the string must have all three.\n\n    However, wait: what if the string is \"aaa\"? Then we don't have any 'b' or 'c'. According to the problem, after B's appending we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends. So the string we are given must have the following properties:\n\n        - Must have at least one 'a'\n        - Must have at least one 'b'\n        - Must have at least one 'c'\n\n    And the order must be: first all the 'a's, then all the 'b's, then all the 'c's.\n\n    Step 3: Let n_a = count of 'a', n_b = count of 'b', n_c = count of 'c'\n\n    Then, the condition for the number of 'c' is: n_c must be either n_a or n_b (or both).\n\n    However, note: the n_a and n_b in the condition are the counts in the entire string after B's appending (which is the entire string without the appended c's). But wait: the entire string we have is the one after C's appending. The problem says: when C appends, the number of c's is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string at the time of appending (which is the string before C's appending). \n\n    How do we relate?\n\n    Let:\n        Original string from A: only a's (say a_count0)\n        Then B appends: only b's (say b_count0) -> so the string before C has n_a0 = a_count0, n_b0 = b_count0, and n_c0 = 0.\n        Then C appends n_c = either a_count0 or b_count0.\n\n    Therefore, the entire string we have is:\n        a_count0 = a_count (the entire string's 'a' count, because no 'a' is added later)\n        b_count0 = b_count (same reason)\n        c_count = either a_count0 or b_count0, i.e., c_count must be either a_count or b_count.\n\n    So the condition is: the total number of 'c' in the string must be equal to either the total number of 'a' or the total number of 'b' (which are the counts from the part before C's appending).\n\n    But note: the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b' are the same as the ones before C's appending, because C only appends 'c's.\n\n    Therefore, the condition is: \n        n_c == n_a OR n_c == n_b\n\n    Step 4: However, we must also ensure the order. The string must be split into three contiguous parts: [a's][b's][c's].\n\n    How to check the order?\n\n        We can traverse the string and make sure that once we leave the 'a' part (i.e., we see a 'b') then we cannot see an 'a' again, and similarly for the 'b' part: once we leave the 'b' part (i.e., we see a 'c') then we cannot see a 'b' again.\n\n    Algorithm for checking the order:\n\n        Let s be the string.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        state = 0  # meaning we haven't started the 'b' part or 'c' part\n        For each char in s:\n            if state == 0: \n                if char == 'a': continue\n                elif char == 'b': state = 1 (meaning we are now in the 'b' part)\n                elif char == 'c': then this is invalid because we should not see 'c' until we have seen at least one 'b'\n\n        Then for state 1:\n            if char == 'b' or 'a': \n                if char == 'a': then that's not allowed (because we already left the 'a' part) -> invalid.\n                if char == 'b': continue\n                if char == 'c': then state becomes 2.\n\n        Then for state 2:\n            if char is 'a' or 'b': invalid.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        found_b = False\n        found_c = False\n        for char in s:\n            if char == 'a':\n                if found_b or found_c:  # meaning we already saw a non-'a' and now we see an 'a' after that -> invalid\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n            elif char == 'b':\n                found_b = True\n                if found_c: # meaning we already saw a 'c' and then we see a 'b' -> invalid\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n            elif char == 'c':\n                found_c = True\n\n        But note: the above will catch the order violation. However, we must also ensure that we have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. \n\n        Actually, the above loop will break if we see an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'c', or a 'b' after a 'c'. \n\n        However, we must also check that the string has at least one of each. But if the string doesn't have one of them, we can check at the end.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Condition 1: The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n        Condition 2: The order must be correct (as above).\n\n        Condition 3: The count of 'c' must be either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'.\n\n    Example: \"aabc\"\n\n        Condition 1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n        Condition 2: \n            Start: \n                'a': ok, then 'a' again: ok, then 'b': mark found_b=True, then 'c': mark found_c=True.\n            Now, the rest is none.\n\n        Condition 3: \n            count('a')=2, count('b')=1, count('c')=1 -> 1 is either 2 or 1 -> yes.\n\n        So \"aabc\" is YES.\n\n    Example: \"aaabccc\"\n\n        Condition 1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n        Condition 2:\n            'a','a','a','b' -> found_b=True, then 'c','c','c' -> valid order.\n        Condition 3: \n            count('a')=3, count('b')=1, count('c')=3 -> 3==3 (for 'a') -> yes.\n\n    Example: \"bbacc\" (given example NO)\n\n        Condition 1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n        Condition 2: \n            First char 'b': then we mark found_b=True. Then next char is 'b' -> ok. Then 'a': but we already found_b (so we have seen a non-'a') and now we see an 'a' -> invalid.\n\n        So we break and output NO.\n\n    Example: \"abc\" (minimal example)\n        Condition 1: has one 'a', one 'b', one 'c' -> yes.\n        Condition 2: \n            'a' -> ok, then 'b' -> set found_b=True, then 'c' -> set found_c=True. No violation.\n        Condition 3: \n            count('a')=1, count('b')=1, count('c')=1 -> 1 is either 1 (for 'a') or 1 (for 'b') -> yes.\n\n    Example: \"aaccc\" (this would be from A: \"aa\", then B: 0 b's? But wait, the problem says B appends some number of 'b's (at least one). So this example is invalid because there must be at least one 'b'. \n\n    However, note: the problem says \"B appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string\". The word \"some\" implies at least one. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'b'. Similarly, C appends at least one 'c'. So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n    But wait, what if the string is \"abbccc\"? \n        Condition 1: has a, b, c -> yes.\n        Condition 2: \n            'a' -> ok, then 'b' -> mark found_b, then 'b' -> ok, then 'c' -> mark found_c, then two more 'c's -> ok.\n        Condition 3: \n            count('a')=1, count('b')=2, count('c')=3 -> 3 is either 1 or 2? No -> so NO.\n\n    Example: \"abbccc\" is NO.\n\n    However, wait: the problem says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string at the time of C's appending. The string at the time of C's appending is \"abb\" (so a=1, b=2). Then C appends 1 or 2 c's. In the example \"abbccc\", the appended c's are 3, which is not 1 nor 2. So condition fails.\n\n    But note: the entire string's 'a' and 'b' counts are the same as at the time of C's appending, because C only appends 'c's.\n\n    Therefore, the condition is: n_c must be either n_a or n_b.\n\n    However, note: the example \"aabc\" has n_a=2, n_b=1, and n_c=1 -> which is equal to n_b.\n\n    One more example: \"aabbc\" (with one c) -> \n        Condition 1: has a, b, c -> yes.\n        Condition 2: order is correct.\n        Condition 3: n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=1 -> 1 is not 2 -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aabbcc\" (two c's) -> \n        Condition 3: n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=2 -> 2 is equal to both -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"aaabbbccc\" (three of each) -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"aaabbbcccccc\" (a=3, b=3, c=6) -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aaabbbcc\" (a=3, b=3, c=2) -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aaabbbccccc\" (a=3, b=3, c=5) -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aaabbbccc\" (a=3, b=3, c=3) -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"aaaabbbbcccc\" (a=4, b=4, c=4) -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"aaaabbbbccccd\" -> invalid because the string is guaranteed to consist of only 'a','b','c'. \n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If not, print \"NO\".\n\n        Step 2: Check the order (using the method above: no 'a' after a 'b', no 'b' after a 'c').\n\n        Step 3: Check that the count of 'c' is either the count of 'a' or the count of 'b'.\n\n        If all three conditions hold, print \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n    However, note: the problem says that the string is given and we are to check if it is possible to obtain the string.\n\n    But wait: what if the string has multiple segments of 'a'? For example, \"aabb\" (without c) is invalid because we require at least one 'c'. But the problem says C appends some number of 'c's (at least one). So the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        # Condition 1: check presence of at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c'\n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Condition 2: check order\n        found_b = False\n        found_c = False\n        for char in s:\n            if char == 'a':\n                if found_b or found_c:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n            elif char == 'b':\n                found_b = True\n                if found_c:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n            elif char == 'c':\n                found_c = True\n\n        # Condition 3: check the count of 'c'\n        n_a = s.count('a')\n        n_b = s.count('b')\n        n_c = s.count('c')\n\n        if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    However, note: the above order check might be too strict? What if the string starts with a 'c'? Then the first character is 'c', then we set found_c=True, and then if we see a 'b' or 'a' we break. But the process requires that the string is built by first giving a's, then b's, then c's. Therefore, the string must start with 'a's and then 'b's and then 'c's. So if we see a 'c' at the beginning, that breaks the condition.\n\n    The above code for the order check does exactly that: if we see a 'c' first, then we mark found_c=True. Then if we see a 'b' (which is allowed only if we haven't seen a 'c'? Actually, the rule is: \n        - We cannot have an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'c'\n        - We cannot have a 'b' after a 'c'\n\n    But note: the condition for 'b' is: if we see a 'b' and we have already seen a 'c', then we break.\n\n    However, the problem says the entire string is built by first a's, then b's, then c's. So the order is fixed.\n\n    But note: what if the string has no 'a'? Then condition 1 fails. Similarly for no 'b' or no 'c'.\n\n    Let me test with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> \n            Condition 1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n            Condition 2: \n                'a' -> nothing happens, then 'a','a','b' -> found_b=True, then 'c','c','c' -> found_c=True. No violation.\n            Condition 3: n_c=3, n_a=3, n_b=1 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n        Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> \n            Condition 1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n            Condition 2: \n                first char 'b': set found_b=True, then next char 'b': ok, then 'a': but we have found_b=True -> triggers the condition for 'a' after non-'a' -> prints \"NO\" and exits.\n\n        Example 3: \"aabc\" -> \n            Condition 1: yes.\n            Condition 2:\n                'a' -> ok, then 'a' -> ok, then 'b' -> found_b=True, then 'c' -> found_c=True. Then done. No violation.\n            Condition 3: n_c=1, n_a=2, n_b=1 -> 1==1 (n_b) -> YES.\n\n    But wait: what if the string is \"abac\"?\n        Condition 1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n        Condition 2: \n            'a' -> ok, then 'b' -> found_b=True, then 'a' -> but we have found_b=True -> invalid.

Output \"NO\".\n\n    Example: \"ba\" -> \n        Condition 1: missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aa\" -> missing 'b' and 'c' -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"a\" -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"abc\" -> \n        Condition 1: has all -> yes.\n        Condition 2: \n            'a' -> ok, 'b' -> set found_b, then 'c' -> set found_c -> no violation.\n        Condition 3: n_c=1, n_a=1, n_b=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"abb\" -> missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aab\" -> missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aabb\" -> missing 'c' -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aabbcc\" -> \n        Condition 1: yes.\n        Condition 2: \n            'a','a' -> ok, then 'b','b' -> ok, then 'c','c' -> ok.\n        Condition 3: n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=2 -> 2==2 -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"aaabbbccc\" -> \n        Condition 1: yes.\n        Condition 2: \n            'a'*3 -> ok, then 'b'*3 -> ok, then 'c'*3 -> ok.\n        Condition 3: n_a=3, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"aaabbbcccccc\" (a=3, b=3, c=6) -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aaabbbcc\" (a=3, b=3, c=2) -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aaabbbccccc\" (a=3, b=3, c=5) -> NO.\n\n    Example: \"aaaabbbbcccc\" (a=4, b=4, c=4) -> YES.\n\n    Example: \"aaaabbbbccccd\" -> invalid input because the string must only contain 'a','b','c'. But our input guarantee says the string consists of 'a','b','c', so we don't need to worry.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the string is guaranteed to consist of 'a','b','c'. So we don't need to check for other letters.\n\n    But wait: what if the string is empty? The problem says |S|>=1.\n\n    This solution seems to cover the requirements.\n\n    However, note: the above order checking code has a potential issue: we break on the first violation. But what if there is a violation later? Our code breaks at the first violation. That is correct because we want to know if the entire string is in the correct order.\n\n    But note: the condition for 'a' is: if we have already seen a 'b' or 'c' and then we see an 'a', that is invalid. Similarly for 'b' after a 'c'.\n\n    Therefore, the code is as below.\n\n    However, note: the problem states that the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (after B's appending) and then C appends at least one 'c'. Therefore, the entire string must have at least one of each. But the condition 1 we check is that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. This is correct.\n\n    Let me test with an example that fails the order condition at the last character: \"aabcb\"\n        Condition 1: has 'a','b','c' -> yes.\n        Condition 2: \n            'a','a' -> ok, then 'b' -> found_b=True, then 'c' -> found_c=True, then 'b' -> but we have found_c=True -> invalid. So we break and output \"NO\".\n\n    But note: the string \"aabcb\" is not built by the process because the 'b' after 'c' is not allowed.\n\n    So the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        found_b = False\n        found_c = False\n        for char in s:\n            if char == 'a':\n                if found_b or found_c:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n            elif char == 'b':\n                found_b = True\n                if found_c:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n            elif char == 'c':\n                found_c = True\n\n        n_a = s.count('a')\n        n_b = s.count('b')\n        n_c = s.count('c')\n\n        if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n    But wait: what if the string has no 'a'? Then condition 1 fails. Similarly for others.\n\n    However, consider an example that meets the condition 1 but fails the order: like \"cba\" (but condition 1: has a,b,c -> yes; then condition 2: first char 'c' -> found_c=True, then 'b' -> violates because found_c is True -> NO). Correct.\n\n    Another example: \"a\" -> condition 1 fails (no 'b' and no 'c') -> NO.\n\n    One more corner: the string \"abc\" is YES, as above.\n\n    But wait: the problem says that the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (after B's appending). In our string, the counts for 'a' and 'b' are the entire string's counts. However, note that the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b' are the same as the counts at the time of C's appending (because C only adds 'c'). So condition 3 uses the entire string's counts for 'a' and 'b', which is correct.\n\n    However, note: the problem says that the string given to C is the one with the a's and b's. Then C appends c's equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in that string. So the condition is: the number of c's (which is the entire string's c's) must equal the number of a's OR the number of b's (from the string given to C). But the string given to C is the entire string without the c's? Actually, no: the string given to C is the one that was built by A and B, and then C appends. Therefore, the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the entire string are the same as in the string given to C.\n\n    Therefore, the condition is correct.\n\n    But wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\" (n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=2) -> YES, because 2==2.\n\n    However, note: the process: \n        A gives \"aa\" (n_a0=2)\n        B appends \"bb\" (n_b0=2) -> string \"aabb\" (n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=0)\n        Then C appends 2 'c's (because 2 is either n_a or n_b) -> total string \"aabbcc\"\n\n    So the condition holds.\n\n    Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"B appends some number of letters 'b'\", meaning at least one. Similarly, C appends at least one. Our condition 1 already ensures that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. But note: the string might have more than one of each.\n\n    But wait: what if the string has multiple 'a's and 'b's but the order is broken? Then we output NO because of the order condition.\n\n    Example: \"aabba\" -> \n        Condition 1: has 'a','b','c'? -> no, wait, no 'c'? Actually, the condition 1 checks for the presence of 'c'. Since there's no 'c', we output NO. But note: the problem says C appends at least one 'c'. So the string must have at least one 'c'. \n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    Let me run through the provided examples:\n\n        Example: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n        aaabccc: YES -> as above.\n        bbacc: NO -> as above.\n        aabc: YES -> as above.\n\n    Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"YES\"\n        \"NO\"\n        \"YES\"\n\n    for the examples.\n\n    Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        found_b = False\n        found_c = False\n        for char in s:\n            if char == 'a':\n                if found_b or found_c:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n            elif char == 'b':\n                found_b = True\n                if found_c:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n            elif char == 'c':\n                found_c = True\n\n        n_a = s.count('a')\n        n_b = s.count('b')\n        n_c = s.count('c')\n\n        if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nHowever, note: the above condition 1 is inefficient because it scans the string three times (once for each `in`). But the string length is at most 5000, so it's acceptable.\n\nBut we can also combine the conditions: we are already scanning the string for order. We could also count the characters during the order check. However, the problem size is small, so it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can remove the initial condition and rely on the order check and the count condition to enforce the presence of at least one of each. But note: the order check does not require the presence of each, but the problem requires at least one of each.\n\nBut the problem requires at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. The order check alone does not guarantee that. For example, the string \"aa\" has no 'b' and no 'c', and the order condition passes (because no violation) but then the count condition would fail because n_c=0 (so condition 3: 0 != n_a and 0 != n_b -> NO). However, we don't even get to the count condition because the initial condition fails.\n\nBut if we remove the initial condition, then the order check and the count condition might be sufficient? \n\nActually, the count condition requires that n_c is either n_a or n_b. But if the string has no 'c', then n_c=0, and we require 0 to be equal to n_a or n_b. But if the string has no 'c', then the condition 1 (initial) would have failed, but if we remove the initial condition, we must rely on the order check and the count condition.\n\nBut note: the order check does not require the presence of 'c'. It just checks the order. So if the string is \"aa\", the order check passes (no violation) and then we check counts: n_a=2, n_b=0, n_c=0 -> 0 is not 2 and 0 is not 0 (since n_b=0) -> condition 3 fails. But wait, the problem says the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. \n\nWe can remove the initial condition and rely on the fact that the count condition and the order condition together imply the presence of each? \n\nActually, the count condition requires that the number of 'c' is either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. But if the string has no 'c', then n_c=0, and we require 0==n_a or 0==n_b. \n\nBut note: the problem states that the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the process). So n_a>=1 and n_b>=1. Therefore, if n_c==0, then 0 is not equal to n_a (which is >=1) and not equal to n_b (which is >=1). So the condition 3 fails.\n\nTherefore, we can remove the initial condition and let the count condition enforce the presence of at least one 'c' (because if n_c is either n_a or n_b, and n_a>=1, n_b>=1, then n_c must be at least 1). \n\nBut wait: the problem says that the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. How do we enforce that? \n\nThe problem says the string is built by A, B, and C. A gives at least one 'a', B appends at least one 'b', and C appends at least one 'c'. \n\nIn the count condition, we require n_c is either n_a or n_b. Since n_a>=1 and n_b>=1, then n_c must be at least 1. \n\nBut what about n_a and n_b? The problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b'. The string must have at least one 'a' (from A) and at least one 'b' (from B). \n\nHow do we enforce that n_a>=1 and n_b>=1? \n\nIf the string has no 'a', then n_a=0, and then the condition 3: n_c must be 0 (because 0 is the only possibility from n_a) but wait, the problem says the string must have at least one 'a'. \n\nBut note: the problem says the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the process). So if we don't have an 'a', then the condition 3 might still hold if n_c is 0 (if n_b is 0) but that's not the case. Actually, if the string has no 'a', then n_a=0, and condition 3: n_c must be 0 (if n_b is 0) or n_c must be 0 (if n_b is not 0, then condition 3 requires n_c==n_b, but n_b>=1, so n_c must be >=1). \n\nBut wait: if the string has no 'a', then n_a=0, and the condition 3 requires n_c==0 or n_c==n_b. However, the problem states that the string must have at least one 'a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' under certain conditions. The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and end with one or more 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the entire string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Presence of All Characters**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any of these characters are missing, the string is invalid.\n2. **Validate Character Order**: The string must follow the sequence where all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n3. **Check Count Condition**: The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This ensures that the 'c's were appended according to the specified conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nif 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\nfound_b = False\nfound_c = False\nfor char in s:\n    if char == 'a':\n        if found_b or found_c:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n    elif char == 'b':\n        found_b = True\n        if found_c:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n    elif char == 'c':\n        found_c = True\n\nn_a = s.count('a')\nn_b = s.count('b')\nn_c = s.count('c')\n\nif n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. If any character is missing, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n2. **Order Validation**: The code then iterates through each character in the string to ensure the correct order. It tracks whether 'b's or 'c's have been encountered. If an 'a' appears after a 'b' or 'c', or if a 'b' appears after a 'c', the string is invalid, and the code outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Count Condition Check**: Finally, the code counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string. If the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's, the string is valid, and the code outputs \"YES\"; otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies all the necessary conditions to determine if the string can be constructed according to the specified rules.",
