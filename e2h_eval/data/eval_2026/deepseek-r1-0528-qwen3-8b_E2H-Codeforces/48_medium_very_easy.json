He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000). The number is guaranteed to be representable.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given string c (which is in base a) to an integer in base 10.\n    Since the base a can be up to 25, and the string can have digits and letters (from 'A' onward for digits above 9), note:\n        - For base <= 10: digits are '0' to 'base-1'\n        - For base > 10: digits are '0' to '9' and then 'A' to 'base-10-1' (so base 11 would use 'A' for 10)\n\n    However, note that the input string may contain leading zeros.\n\n 2. Then, if b is not 'R', convert the base-10 integer to base b (again, same rules: base from 2 to 25, so we can use standard conversion with digits up to 24).\n\n    But note: the input number c might be very large (up to 10^1510 in base 10? Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", meaning when b is not R, the number in base 10 could be huge. However, note the input representation: the string c has at most 1000 digits. So we have to be careful with the conversion from base a to base 10, and then from base 10 to base b.\n\n    However, note: the base a is at most 25, and the string has at most 1000 digits. The maximum value in base 10 would be (a^1000 - 1). For a=25, that is 25^1000 which is astronomically huge (way beyond what Python integers can handle directly without arbitrary precision, but Python does have arbitrary precision, so we can use it, but the conversion algorithm must be efficient).\n\n    But wait: the problem says for the non-Roman case, the number won't be greater than 10^1510. However, 10^1510 is a 1 followed by 1510 zeros, which is about 10^1510. The maximum number we might get from base a (<=25) with 1000 digits is 25^1000. Let's compare:\n\n        log10(25^1000) = 1000 * log10(25) ≈ 1000 * 1.39794 ≈ 1397.94 -> so 25^1000 has about 1400 digits in base 10.\n\n        But 10^1510 has 1511 digits. So the problem says the number (when not Roman) won't be greater than 10^1510. However, if we read a string of 1000 digits in base 25, we might get numbers up to 25^1000 which is less than 10^1510. So we are safe.\n\n    But note: the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" is base2 to base2, and the number is 1111001 in base2. That is 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 121.\n\n 3. If b is 'R', then we convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n    Important: The Roman numeral conversion is only used when the number is <= 300010 and not zero.\n\n    How to convert an integer to Roman numerals?\n\n    We know the standard mapping:\n\n        I = 1\n        V = 5\n        X = 10\n        L = 50\n        C = 100\n        D = 500\n        M = 1000\n\n    And the subtractive notation: IV (4), IX (9), XL (40), XC (90), CD (400), CM (900).\n\n    We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n    Steps for Roman conversion (for numbers up to 300010, but note: the problem says the number is at most 300010 and not zero):\n\n        We can use a list of tuples for the symbols and their values, from highest to lowest.\n\n        Example: \n          roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, 'M'),\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'),\n            (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n          ]\n\n        Then, for a given number n, we can iterate over these tuples and for each tuple, we subtract the value as many times as needed and append the corresponding symbol.\n\n        But note: our number can be up to 300010, so we can do:\n\n        However, 300010 is 300,010. We can break it down:\n\n        But note: the standard Roman numerals don't have a symbol for 5000 or higher, so we have to represent 300010 as \"CCCM\" ... but wait, actually:\n\n        The problem says the number is at most 300010. So we can use the standard system.\n\n        But note: 300010 is 300,010. We can represent 300000 as \"CCCM\" ? Actually, no: \n          100000 is not a standard symbol. However, the problem states that the number is at most 300010. \n\n        According to the problem, the Roman numeral representation is defined as in the example: \n          Example: Input \"5 R\\n4\" -> Output \"IV\"\n\n        Since 300010 is within the range that we can represent with the standard symbols? Actually, no: the standard symbols go up to 1000 (M). \n\n        Let me check the problem statement: \"the number would be less than or equal to 300010\". \n\n        But 300010 is 300,010, which is 300 thousands and 10. We can represent 300000 as three hundred thousands? Actually, the standard system doesn't extend beyond 3999. However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we must represent numbers up to 300010.\n\n        There are extended Roman numerals for larger numbers, but the problem doesn't specify. However, note the example: the input constraint says the number is at most 300010, and we are guaranteed that when Roman is chosen the number is not zero and <= 300010.\n\n        We can use the standard method for numbers up to 3999, and for numbers above 3999 we need a different approach? \n\n        But note: 300010 is greater than 3999. \n\n        Actually, the problem says \"the fourth and ninth iteration\" meaning that the subtractive principle is applied for multiples. However, the standard system does not have symbols for 5000 or 10000. \n\n        But wait: the problem says \"bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" but that was for the input representation. For Roman, we have to stick to the standard system? Or does the problem allow extended systems?\n\n        Let me read the problem again: It says \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n        And then: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\"\n\n        This part is for the input representation (the c string) and the output representation (base b). But for Roman, we are using the standard system.\n\n        However, the problem says the number is at most 300010. \n\n        Standard Roman numerals did not have a standard way to represent numbers beyond 3999. But since the problem says up to 300010, we must represent 300010.\n\n        How? One common way is to use a bar over a numeral to multiply it by 1000, but that is not standard. Alternatively, we can break it down:\n\n        But note: the problem examples: \n          Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> Output: \"V\"\n          Input: \"5 R\\n4\" -> Output: \"IV\"\n\n        So we must handle numbers from 1 to 300010.\n\n        After checking the problem statement: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\"\n\n        Since the standard system goes only to 3999, and 300010 is larger, we need to extend.\n\n        However, looking at the example: 300010 is 300,010. \n\n        We can think of representing 300000 as three hundred thousand. In extended Roman numerals, one way is to write MMM (3000) and then add a bar (or use parentheses) to denote multiplication by 1000? But the problem does not specify.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might expect that we break the number into parts. But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we can represent 300010 as:\n\n        We can use the following: \n          300000 -> \"C\" repeated 3000 times? No, that's not practical.\n\n        Actually, the problem says the number is at most 300010. This is a specific value. \n\n        Let me re-read the problem statement: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n        It doesn't mention anything beyond 3999.\n\n        But wait, the problem also says: \"Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\" and the example inputs are small.\n\n        After reading the problem again, note: the guarantee is that the number (when Roman) is <= 300010. So we have to handle up to 300010.\n\n        Standard Roman numerals do not have a standard representation for numbers beyond 3999. However, there are historical notations, but we are not told which to use.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to say that the number is at most 3000? But it says 300010.\n\n        Let me check the example: the example input \"5 R\\n4\" is 4, which is small. The example \"16 R\\n5\" is 5, small.\n\n        And the next example: \"2 2\\n1111001\" is base2 to base2, so not Roman.\n\n        The last example: \"12 13\\nA\" -> base12 to base13, so not Roman.\n\n        There is no example for a large Roman number.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"the number would be less than or equal to 300010\", so we must handle up to 300010.\n\n        How to handle?\n\n        Let me consider: 300010 = 300000 + 10.\n\n        We can break it down:\n\n        We can use the standard method for numbers below 4000, and then for numbers above 4000, we can use a different approach.\n\n        However, note: 300010 is 300000+10. \n\n        Standard representation for 300000 is not defined. But one common extended method is to use a bar over a numeral to mean multiplied by 1000. For example, V with a bar is 5000. So:\n\n        But the problem does not specify such extended symbols.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        Since 300010 is 300010, we can break it into:\n\n          300000 = 3 * 100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n        Another idea: use parentheses? For example, (C) for 100000? But that is non-standard.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, I think we should rely on the fact that the problem says the number is at most 300010, and the standard system only goes up to 3999. \n\n        But 300010 is greater than 3999. So we must extend.\n\n        Let me check the problem statement: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" - this is for the input representation, not for Roman.\n\n        Wait, the problem says: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\"\n\n        So the input string c is in base a, and if b is R then the base-10 integer represented by c is at most 300010.\n\n        Therefore, we are guaranteed that the base-10 integer we get from converting c (in base a) is between 1 and 300010.\n\n        Now, how to convert an integer in the range [1, 300010] to Roman numerals?\n\n        Since 300010 is 300010, we can use the standard method for numbers up to 3999 and then for 4000 to 300010 we use an extended method.\n\n        However, the standard system doesn't extend. \n\n        But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010, which is 300010. We can use a system that uses:\n\n        Let me look at historical extended Roman numerals:\n\n        One way is to use the apostrophophore system: adding up I's for thousands. For example, 8000 would be IVM (which is 8 x 1000) but that's not standard.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n        We know that 300010 = 300000 + 10.\n\n        We can represent 300000 as \"C\" repeated 300000 times? That would be too long.\n\n        Actually, the problem expects a concise representation.\n\n        After thinking, I recall that sometimes large numbers are represented by multiple M's. But M is 1000, so 300000 would require 300 M's, which is 300 characters. The problem does not specify a limit on the length of the Roman numeral string, but the input string c is at most 1000 digits in base a (which is 25), so the base10 number is at most 25^1000, but we are guaranteed that when b is R, the number is <= 300010. So the base10 number is at most 300010, so the Roman numeral string won't be too long.\n\n        However, 300000 is 300000, which is 300 thousands. We can break it down:\n\n        We can use the standard method for the thousands part:\n\n        For example, 300000 = 3 * 100000. But we don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n        But wait, in extended Roman numerals, sometimes numbers greater than 3999 are written by putting a bar over the basic symbols, but that is not in the standard set.\n\n        Another common method is to use parentheses for thousands: \n\n          (I) = 1000, (II) = 2000, (III) = 3000, (IV) = 4000, etc.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify such.\n\n        Let me check the example outputs: they are small.\n\n        Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, and 300010 is 300000+10, we can try to represent 300000 as \"MMMD\"? No, because M is 1000, so 300000 would be MMM... (300 M's). That is 300 characters.\n\n        But note: the problem says the input string c has at most 1000 digits (in base a, which is up to 25). The base-10 integer we get from that string might be very large (like 25^1000) but the problem guarantees that when we have Roman, the base10 integer is <= 300010. So the base10 integer is small (at most 300010) and we can represent it with a string of at most a few hundred characters (if we use the M's) but 300000 would be 300 M's, which is acceptable because the problem doesn't say anything about the length of the output, but we must omit leading zeros.\n\n        However, 300000 is 300000, and we can break it down:\n\n        But wait, the problem says the base10 integer is at most 300010, so the maximum is 300010. The minimum is 1.\n\n        We can use the standard method for numbers from 1 to 3999, and for numbers from 4000 to 300010, we can break the number into:\n\n          n = (n // 1000) * 1000 + (n % 1000)\n\n        Then, represent the thousands part with the letter 'M' repeated (n//1000) times, and then the last three digits with the standard method.\n\n        But is that correct? \n\n        Example: 4000 -> MMMM? But standard subtractive notation for 4000 is usually written as MMMMM? Actually, no, standard subtractive for 4000 is not defined, but we can use MMMM (4000) or sometimes IV with a bar (which is 4000). \n\n        However, the problem says the subtractive principle is used for the fourth and ninth iteration. The fourth iteration is for multiples of 1000? Actually, the subtractive principle is defined for the same base unit and the next higher base unit (like I and V, X and L, etc.). \n\n        But for thousands, we don't have a symbol for 5000 (V with a bar) or 10000 (X with a bar). \n\n        Given the confusion, let me stick to the standard representation for numbers up to 3999, and for numbers above 3999, we use the following:\n\n        We break the number into groups of thousands. Each group of three digits (hundreds, tens, ones) is converted by the standard method, and the thousands part is represented by repeating 'M' for each thousand (without any subtractive because we don't have a symbol for 5000 or 10000). \n\n        But wait, the standard method for 4000 is MMMM (four M's) and 5000 is V (but we don't have V for 5000, we use a bar). \n\n        However, the problem does not specify extended symbols. Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, and 300010 is 300000+10, we can do:\n\n        Let n = 300010.\n\n        We can write it as: \"C\" for 100000? But wait, the standard system doesn't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify any extended symbols, so we must use the standard ones. \n\n        But then, how do we represent 4000? The standard system doesn't have a symbol for 4000. \n\n        After checking the problem statement: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n        It doesn't say anything about thousands beyond 3999.\n\n        Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, and the example inputs are small, and the problem is from an old time, maybe the intended solution is to use the standard method only for numbers up to 3999, and for numbers above 3999, we use a different representation? Or perhaps the input base a and the number c are such that the base10 integer is always <= 3999? \n\n        Let me check the guarantee: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\"\n\n        But 300010 is greater than 3999. \n\n        However, note: the input c is in base a (which is at least 2). The maximum base10 value for a string of 1000 digits in base 25 is 25^1000, but the problem also says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", but when b is R, we are guaranteed the number is <=300010. \n\n        So we are safe: the base10 integer is at most 300010.\n\n        But how to represent 300010? \n\n        I found online that there are extended Roman numeral systems. One common one is:\n\n          For thousands: \n            - 5000 is represented as ⋓ (V with a bar) but that is not ASCII.\n            - 10000 is represented as ⊩ (X with a bar) or ✿ (Jupiter symbol) or just more M's.\n\n        Since we are writing a text output, we can use multiple M's.\n\n        However, the problem expects an output without any extra libraries, and the example outputs are small.\n\n        Considering the constraints (number <= 300010), we can break the number into:\n\n          Let n = 300010.\n\n          We can write n = 300*1000 + 10.\n\n          Then, represent 300 as \"C\" repeated 300 times? No, because in Roman numerals, 100 is C, so 300 is CCC.\n\n          But wait, we are talking about thousands: 300000 is 300 * 1000. In standard Roman numerals, we don't have a symbol for 100000, so 1000 is M, 2000 is MM, 3000 is MMM, 4000 is MMMM, 5000 is V (but with a bar, so not available), so we use MMMM for 4000.\n\n          Then, 300000 would be MMM... (300 times) M? That's 300 M's.\n\n        But 300 M's is a string of 300 characters. The problem does not specify a limit, but we must output the numeral.\n\n        However, the problem says the input string c has at most 1000 digits, but after conversion to base10, it's at most 300010. The output for base b (if R) must be a string of Roman numerals.\n\n        But 300000 is 300000, and we can use the standard method for the entire number if we use the subtractive principle for the thousands? Actually, no, because the subtractive principle is defined for the given set of symbols.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a system that breaks the number into:\n\n          n = d0 + d1*10 + d2*100 + d3*1000 + ... \n\n        But the standard Roman numerals only go to 1000 (M). \n\n        After research, the standard way to represent large numbers in Roman numerals is to use the horizontal bar to mean \"times 1000\", but that requires non-standard characters.\n\n        Since the problem is from 260 AD and the example inputs are small, and the problem says the number is at most 300010, I think the intended solution is to use the standard method for numbers up to 3999, and for numbers above 3999, we use the same method but with the thousands part represented by multiple M's (without any special subtractive for thousands).\n\n        Steps for Roman conversion (for n from 1 to 300010):\n\n          Let n be the integer.\n\n          Break n into: n = k * 1000 + r, where r = n % 1000, and k = n // 1000.\n\n          Then, represent k as a series of M's (each M is 1000). But wait, the standard subtractive principle for thousands? Actually, the standard system doesn't use subtractive for thousands. For example, 4000 is written as MMMM (four M's) and 8000 as MMMMMMMM (eight M's).\n\n          Then, represent r (which is from 0 to 999) by the standard method (using the provided subtractive rules).\n\n          However, note: the standard method for r (0 to 999) is defined as:\n\n            M = 1000 (but we already separated thousands, so r is <1000)\n            Then, we break r into hundreds, tens, ones.\n\n          But wait, we broke n into k*1000 + r, so r is the part below 1000.\n\n          However, what if we want to use the subtractive principle for thousands? Actually, the subtractive principle is defined for the given symbols (I, V, X, L, C, D, M). For example, 4000 is often written as MMMM, but sometimes as IV with a bar (meaning 4000) but we don't have a bar.\n\n          Since the problem does not specify, and the example numbers are small, we'll assume that for numbers above 3999, we simply use as many M's as needed (without subtractive) and then the rest with the standard method.\n\n          But wait, that would be non-standard. For example, 4000 should be MMMM, but standard subtractive for the thousands place is not defined. However, the subtractive principle is defined for the same base unit and the next higher base unit, but for thousands, the next higher base unit would be 10000 (which we don't have).\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the standard method for the entire number without breaking it into thousands? \n\n          Actually, the standard method for Roman numerals works for any positive integer by decomposing the number from the highest value to the lowest.\n\n          We can define the list of value-symbol pairs in descending order, including the extended values for thousands? \n\n          But the standard list is:\n\n            [(1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'), (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'), (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')]\n\n          This list works for numbers up to 3999.\n\n          For numbers above 3999, we need to extend the list. One way is to include:\n\n            (5000, 'V̅'), (10000, 'X̅'), etc.\n\n          But we cannot use these because we are limited to standard characters.\n\n          Another way is to break the number into thousands and use the standard list for the thousands part, but then the thousands part (which is k) is represented by k/1000 M's? No, because k can be any integer from 0 to 300 (since n<=300010, then k = n//1000 is at most 300).\n\n          We can do:\n\n            while k > 3999:\n                # but k is at most 300, so we don't need to worry.\n\n          Actually, since k = n//1000, and n<=300010, then k is at most 300.\n\n          So we can simply use the standard method for the entire number by extending the list to include:\n\n            (1000, 'M') repeated up to 300 times? But that would be inefficient.\n\n          Alternatively, we can handle the thousands separately.\n\n          Let me design the Roman conversion function:\n\n          def to_roman(n):\n            # We break n into thousands part and the rest.\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"\"\n            # Extend the list for numbers above 3999? Actually, we can use the standard list for the entire number if we consider that the standard list includes 1000 as the highest, but then 4000 would be represented as 'MMMM' and that is not in the list.\n\n          How about we do:\n\n            roman_numerals = [\n                (1000, 'M'),\n                (900, 'CM'),\n                (500, 'D'),\n                (400, 'CD'),\n                (100, 'C'),\n                (90, 'XC'),\n                (50, 'L'),\n                (40, 'XL'),\n                (10, 'X'),\n                (9, 'IX'),\n                (5, 'V'),\n                (4, 'IV'),\n                (1, 'I')\n            ]\n\n          But this list only goes up to 1000. So for 2000, we get 'MM'. \n\n          However, 3000 is 'MMM', which is correct. 4000 would be 'MMMM', which is not in the list, so we do:\n\n            while n >= 1000:\n                roman_numerals.append((1000, 'M'))   # This is not good because we can't modify the list during iteration.\n\n          Better: we can use the standard algorithm that repeatedly subtracts the largest possible value.\n\n          But the standard algorithm:\n\n            def to_roman(n):\n                roman_map = {\n                    1000: 'M',\n                    900: 'CM',\n                    500: 'D',\n                    400: 'CD',\n                    100: 'C',\n                    90: 'XC',\n                    50: 'L',\n                    40: 'XL',\n                    10: 'X',\n                    9: 'IX',\n                    5: 'V',\n                    4: 'IV',\n                    1: 'I'\n                }\n                roman = ''\n                for value, symbol in roman_map.items():\n                    while n >= value:\n                        roman += symbol\n                        n -= value\n                return roman\n\n          This works for n <= 3999.\n\n          For n=4000, we would use the while loop for 1000: \n            n=4000, subtract 1000 -> becomes 3000, then 3000 times 'M'? Actually, no: the while loop condition is n>=value, so it will subtract 1000 until n<1000.\n\n          But 4000 // 1000 = 4, so we would add 'M' four times -> \"MMMM\".\n\n          Similarly, 5000: \n            First, subtract 1000 four times: 5000-4000=1000, then subtract 1000 again -> 0, so we get \"MMMMM\", but that is 5000, but standard is to use V (with bar) for 5000. However, the problem doesn't specify, so we can use multiple M's.\n\n          But wait, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we don't need to worry about 4000 or more? \n\n          Actually, 300010 is 300010, which is 300 * 1000 + 10. \n\n          Using the above algorithm:\n\n            n = 300010\n            It will subtract 1000 repeatedly 300 times, leaving 10.\n            Then, for 10: add 'X'.\n\n            Result: \"M\"*300 + \"X\"\n\n          But 300010 is 300000 + 10, so we should write \"C\" for 100000? No, we don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n          However, note: the standard Roman numerals do not have a symbol for 100000. So we are forced to use multiple M's.\n\n          But 300000 is 300 thousands, so we use 300 M's.\n\n          Is that acceptable? The problem does not specify, but the example inputs are small.\n\n          However, the problem says the input string c has at most 1000 digits, and the base10 integer is at most 300010, so the output Roman numeral string might be up to 3000 characters (if the number is 300000, then 300000 is 300 M's, so 300 characters). 300 is acceptable.\n\n          But wait, 300000 is 300 * 1000, so 300 M's is the representation.\n\n          However, there is a more compact way: using the bar notation for 5000 and above, but we don't have bar.\n\n          Given the problem constraints, we can use the above simple algorithm for all numbers from 1 to 300010.\n\n          But wait, what about numbers that require subtractive notation in the thousands part? For example, 4000 is represented as MMMM, but sometimes people use IV (with bar) for 4000. However, the problem says the subtractive principle is used for the fourth and ninth iteration, meaning the standard subtractive for I-V, X-L, C-D, M? Actually, the standard subtractive principle is defined for the given units, and the thousands unit is M, so the next unit would be 10*M = 10000, which is not defined. So we don't have a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of the target base being the Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, then converting it to the desired target base (either a standard base or Roman numerals).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input number is provided as a string in base `a`. We first convert this string to a base 10 integer. Each character in the string is processed to determine its value in base `a`, considering that bases greater than 10 use letters (A-Z) to represent values beyond 9.\n\n2. **Standard Base Conversion**: If the target base `b` is a standard integer base (2-25), we convert the base 10 number to base `b`. This involves repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders, which are then mapped to corresponding digits (0-9 and A-Y for values 10-24).\n\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', we convert the base 10 number to a Roman numeral. This requires breaking down the number into components that can be represented using Roman numeral symbols (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) and their subtractive forms (IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM). The conversion is done by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols to the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except:\n        a = a_str\n\n    b = int(b_str) if b_str != 'R' else 'R'\n\n    if a == 1:\n        num_val = 0\n    else:\n        num_str_clean = num_str.lstrip('0')\n        if num_str_clean == '':\n            num_val = 0\n        else:\n            num_val = 0\n            for char in num_str_clean:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    digit = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    digit = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n                if digit >= a:\n                    print(\"Invalid digit for base\", a)\n                    return\n                num_val = num_val * a + digit\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        if num_val == 0:\n            print(\"\")\n            return\n            \n        roman_map = [\n            (1000, 'M'),\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (100, 'C'),\n            (90, 'XC'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n        \n        roman_numerals = []\n        for value, symbol in roman_map:\n            while num_val >= value:\n                roman_numerals.append(symbol)\n                num_val -= value\n                \n        result = ''.join(roman_numerals)\n        print(result)\n        \n    else:\n        b_int = int(b_str)\n        if num_val == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n            \n        digits = []\n        n = num_val\n        while n:\n            n, r = divmod(n, b_int)\n            digits.append(r)\n            \n        digits.reverse()\n        res_str = ''\n        for digit in digits:\n            if digit < 10:\n                res_str += str(digit)\n            else:\n                res_str += chr(ord('A') + digit - 10)\n                \n        print(res_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains the source base `a` and the target base `b` (which can be 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number to be converted as a string in base `a`.\n\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input string is processed to compute its decimal equivalent. Each character is converted to its numerical value, and these values are used to build the decimal number by iterating through each digit.\n\n3. **Standard Base Conversion**: If the target base is a standard integer, the decimal number is converted by repeatedly dividing by the target base and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (0-9 or letters A-Y for values 10-24).\n\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: For the Roman numeral conversion, the decimal number is decomposed into the largest possible Roman numeral values. The corresponding symbols are appended to the result string until the number is reduced to zero. This ensures the Roman numeral representation uses the fewest symbols while adhering to the subtractive principle (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
