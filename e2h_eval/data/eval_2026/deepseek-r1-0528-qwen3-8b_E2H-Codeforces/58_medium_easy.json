You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\nWe are to find:\n1. The minimum number of edges `t` that must be added to form a simple cycle of odd length (at least 3 vertices) in an undirected graph without parallel edges and loops.\n2. The number of ways `w` (as sets of edges) to add `t` edges to achieve this.\n\nNote: We cannot add loops or parallel edges.\n\nObservations:\n\n1. A simple cycle of odd length must have at least 3 edges (triangle). The smallest odd cycle is a triangle (length 3).\n\n2. There are two main cases to consider:\n   a) The given graph already contains an odd-length cycle (of length>=3). Then we don't need to add any edge? But wait, note the problem says \"minimum number of edges to be added\" to form such a cycle. So if there is already an odd cycle, then t=0 and w=1 (if the graph has one odd cycle, but actually if there is at least one odd cycle then we don't need to add any edge). However, note: the problem says \"to form a simple cycle of an odd length\", so if there is already one, then we don't need to add.\n\n   But wait: what if the graph has no odd cycle? Then we need to add some edges.\n\nHowever, note that the graph might not be connected. Also, we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (but without creating parallel edges or loops) and the goal is to form at least one odd cycle.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the entire graph becomes having an odd cycle, but that after adding `t` edges, there exists at least one odd cycle.\n\nLet's consider:\n\nCase 1: The graph already has an odd cycle -> then t=0, w=1.\n\nBut wait: what if the graph has multiple odd cycles? Then we still don't need to add any edge, so t=0, but w would be 1 because we are not adding any edge (so only one way: add nothing). However, note that the problem says \"the minimum number of edges\", so if we can form an odd cycle without adding any edge, then we use t=0.\n\nCase 2: The graph has no odd cycle. Then we must add edges until we form an odd cycle.\n\nWhat are the possibilities?\n\nNote: In an undirected graph, a cycle is odd if the number of edges (which equals the number of vertices in the cycle) is odd and at least 3.\n\nHow can we form an odd cycle by adding edges?\n\nOption 1: Form a triangle (a 3-cycle) by adding one edge. But note: if there is already a path of two edges between two vertices, then adding the third edge will complete the triangle. However, if the graph is bipartite (i.e., no odd cycles) then we can use the bipartition to our advantage.\n\nIn fact, we can think of the graph as being composed of connected components. Each connected component is bipartite? Because if a component is not bipartite, then it contains an odd cycle and we are in Case 1.\n\nSo if the graph is bipartite (each connected component is bipartite), then there is no odd cycle. Now, how do we form an odd cycle?\n\nWe can consider:\n\n- Adding one edge: This will create an odd cycle if and only if the two vertices of the edge belong to the same part in their bipartite component. Why?\n  Suppose we have a connected bipartite graph with parts A and B. If we add an edge within A (or within B), then consider a path from a vertex u in A to v in A (using existing edges). The path must have even length (since u and v are in the same part). Then the total cycle is the path (even) plus the new edge (one edge) -> total edges = even + 1 = odd. So the cycle is odd.\n\nBut note: the problem requires the cycle to be simple (each vertex at most once). The edge we add and the existing path must form a cycle that doesn't repeat vertices. However, if the two vertices are in the same connected component and we add an edge between two nodes in the same part, then we get an odd cycle.\n\nBut wait: what if the two vertices are in different connected components? Then adding an edge between them does not necessarily form a cycle. We need a cycle. So the edge must connect two vertices in the same connected component? Or if we connect two different components, then we don't get a cycle immediately. Therefore, to form a cycle we must connect two vertices that are already connected by a path (so same component) and then the edge must be within the same part.\n\nTherefore, for t=1: we can only form an odd cycle by adding one edge if there exists at least one pair of vertices (u, v) in the same connected component (so that they are in the same bipartite parts) such that the edge (u, v) is not present and u and v are in the same part.\n\nBut note: what if the graph is disconnected? Then we can also consider connecting two different components. However, connecting two components doesn't immediately form a cycle. To form a cycle we must have a connection that closes a loop. So we must have two distinct vertices in the same component (so that the edge forms a cycle). Therefore, edges added between two different components cannot form a cycle by themselves.\n\nThus, for t=1, we must have an edge added within a connected component (which is bipartite) and the two endpoints must be in the same part.\n\nBut what if we don't have any such edge? Then we cannot form an odd cycle by adding one edge. Then we must consider adding more edges.\n\nWhat about adding two edges? \n\nPossibility: \n  - Add two edges that together form a triangle (with three vertices). But note: if we have three vertices, we need all three edges. However, we are only allowed to add two. Then we cannot form a triangle by adding two edges if the underlying edges are missing. Alternatively, we might form an odd cycle by adding two edges that connect two different components? Actually, forming a cycle requires at least three edges. But note: we can form a cycle of length 5 or more.\n\nBut note: we are looking for the minimum number of edges. So we try t=0, then t=1, then t=2, etc.\n\nHowever, note that sometimes t=0 is possible (if there's an odd cycle already). Then we don't consider higher t.\n\nBut if there's no odd cycle (graph is bipartite), then:\n\n  - t=1: if there exists at least one pair of vertices in the same connected component and same part (and the edge is missing) then we can form an odd cycle by adding one edge.\n\n  - If there is no such pair in the entire graph (for t=1), then we must consider t=2.\n\nBut wait: is there a way to form an odd cycle with two edges? \n\nConsider: We add two edges. One possibility is to form a triangle by adding two edges if the underlying graph already has one edge of the triangle. However, if the graph is bipartite, then we cannot have an edge that is part of an odd cycle? Actually, the graph being bipartite means that in each connected component we can color the graph with two colors. Then, if we want to form a cycle of odd length, we must have an odd cycle somewhere.\n\nAnother idea: we can form a cycle of length 5 by adding two edges? \n\nExample: Let the graph be two disjoint edges (a matching). Then we can form a 5-cycle? Actually, we need 5 vertices. But we are only adding two edges. However, we are free to choose which edges to add.\n\nBut note: we are counting the minimum number of edges to be added. So if we can form an odd cycle by adding two edges, then t=2.\n\nHow?\n\nConsider a connected bipartite graph (with two parts, say A and B). We can add two edges: one edge from A to A (same part) and then one edge from A to A again? But wait, that might not form a cycle. Alternatively, we can form a triangle by connecting two vertices in the same part and then connecting one of them to a vertex in the opposite part that was already connected? \n\nWait: Actually, we can form a triangle by adding two edges if the base (the third edge) is already present. But the base edge must be present. However, in a bipartite graph, the base edge would be between two parts, so that's allowed. But then the two edges we add must be two edges of the triangle. But then the triangle is formed by two edges we add and one existing edge. However, the triangle is an odd cycle (3 edges). \n\nBut note: the two edges we add must be the two edges that complete the triangle. However, we are only allowed to add two edges, so we are missing the third edge. But wait, the third edge is already present. So the condition is: we have an existing edge (u, v) (which is between A and B). Then we add edges (u, w) and (v, w) for some w. Then the cycle u->v->w->u is a triangle (odd). But note: the graph is bipartite, so the color of w must be the opposite of u and opposite of v? \n\nActually, if u is in A, then v is in B, and then w must be in A for the edge (u,w) to be between A and A? Wait, no: in bipartite graph we can only have edges between A and B. But we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (as long as not present and not a loop). However, when we add edges, we break the bipartite property. But note: we are not required to keep the graph bipartite.\n\nBut wait, the graph is bipartite initially, but when we add edges, we can add edges within the same part. So the two edges we add are both within the same part? Actually, we are adding two edges: (u, w) and (v, w). Now, what are the colors of u, v, w?\n\nInitially, u is in A, v is in B. Then for the edge (u, w) to exist in the bipartite graph, w must be in B (because u is in A). Similarly, for (v, w): v is in B and w is in B -> that would be an edge within B (same part). But wait, we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (non-bipartite). So we can add (u, w) and (v, w) even if they are not crossing.\n\nBut then the cycle is u-v-w-u: \n  u (A) - v (B) - w (B) - u (A). The edges: \n    u-v: exists (crossing)\n    v-w: added (same part for v and w -> both B, so same part)\n    w-u: added (crossing? because u is A and w is B -> that would be crossing, but wait: if we set w to be in B, then u (A) and w (B) is crossing, which is allowed in bipartite? But we are breaking the bipartite structure by adding two edges: (u,w) [crossing] and (v,w) [non-crossing]. However, the non-crossing edge breaks the bipartiteness.\n\nBut note: we are not restricted to keep the graph bipartite. We are just starting from a bipartite graph and adding edges arbitrarily.\n\nBut wait: the problem does not require the graph to remain bipartite. So we can add edges arbitrarily.\n\nSo to form a triangle (three edges) we need three edges. But we are adding two edges. How can we form a triangle with two edges? Actually, the triangle must have three edges. If two edges are added and one edge is already present, then the triangle is formed. But then the two edges we add must connect two vertices to a common vertex, and the existing edge must be between two of them.\n\nBut note: the existing edge must be between two vertices that are in the same connected component (so that they are connected). However, we are allowed to pick any two edges to add. \n\nBut note: we are looking for the minimum number of edges to add. So if we can form an odd cycle by adding two edges, then t=2, unless we can form an odd cycle by adding one edge (then t=1).\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Check if the graph already has an odd cycle (i.e., is the graph non-bipartite in at least one connected component? Actually, if the graph is non-bipartite, then there is an odd cycle. But note: a non-bipartite graph may have multiple cycles, but we are only concerned with the existence of at least one odd cycle.\n\n   How to check: we can do a bipartite check (BFS/DFS coloring) on each connected component. If any component is not bipartite, then we have an odd cycle and t=0, w=1.\n\n   But wait: what if the graph is non-bipartite, but we have multiple connected components? Then we only need one odd cycle in the entire graph.\n\n2. If the graph is bipartite (all components are bipartite), then we look for the minimal t.\n\n   For t=1: \n        We need to count the number of pairs (u, v) (with u < v) such that:\n          - u and v are in the same connected component (so that the edge (u,v) creates a cycle) and \n          - u and v are in the same part (so that the cycle created by the edge and the existing path is odd) and \n          - the edge (u, v) is not present in the graph.\n\n        Let the component have two parts: A and B. Then the pairs (u, v) in the same part are the pairs in A and the pairs in B.\n\n        However, note: the same component might have multiple edges. We must avoid counting edges that are already present.\n\n        So for a component, the total pairs in part A: C(|A|, 2), similarly for B: C(|B|, 2). Then subtract the existing edges within A and within B? But wait, the graph is bipartite, so by definition, there are no edges within A or within B. Therefore, the number of missing edges within the same part in this component is exactly C(|A|,2) + C(|B|,2).\n\n        But note: the graph is bipartite, so no edge exists between two vertices in the same part. Therefore, all these pairs are missing.\n\n        Then, for the entire graph, the total ways for t=1 is the sum over all connected components of [C(|A_i|,2) + C(|B_i|,2)].\n\n        However, we must note: the edge we add must be between two vertices in the same connected component. And we are counting every such pair (u,v) in the same component and same part.\n\n        But wait: what if two vertices from the same component are in the same part, but the edge is already present? Then we shouldn't count it. But since the graph is bipartite, there are no edges within the same part. Therefore, we don't have to subtract anything.\n\n        So w1 = sum_{each component i} [ (|A_i|*(|A_i|-1)//2 + (|B_i|*(|B_i|-1)//2 ]\n\n        Then, if w1 > 0, then t=1 and w = w1.\n\n   For t=2: \n        We must form an odd cycle by adding two edges. \n\n        There are two ways to form an odd cycle with two edges:\n\n        Possibility 1: Form a triangle by adding two edges, where one edge is already present.\n\n        Conditions: \n          - We have three vertices (say u, v, w) such that the graph already has one edge (say between u and v) and we add edges (u,w) and (v,w). Then the cycle u->v->w->u is odd.\n\n          Note: the edge u-v must be present (so in the graph). And the edges u-w and v-w must not be present.\n\n          Also, note: the graph is bipartite, so the edge u-v is between two parts (so u and v are in different parts). Then, to form the triangle, w must be in the same part as u (so that the edge u-w is same part and v-w is between parts? Actually, no: the edge u-w: if u is in A, then w must be in B for the edge u-w to be crossing? But wait, we are adding edges arbitrarily. However, the cycle condition: \n            u (A) --v (B) [exists]\n            v (B) --w (must be in A for the edge v-w to be crossing? because v is B) -> then w is A, then edge w-u is from A to A? That would be an edge within A, which is allowed because we are adding it.\n\n          Actually, the edges we add can be arbitrary. The condition for forming the triangle is:\n            - The existing edge (u,v) is present (between two parts).\n            - The two edges (u,w) and (v,w) are not present.\n\n          But note: the graph is bipartite, so the edge (u,w) would be between two parts if w is in the opposite part of u? But then the cycle: \n            u (A) - v (B) - w (A) - u (A): \n            The edges: \n                u-v: A-B (present)\n                v-w: B-A (present? no, because we are adding it. But wait, if w is A, then v-w is B-A, which is allowed in bipartite? However, we are going to break the bipartite property by adding two edges: (u,w) and (v,w). \n                u-w: A-A (same part) -> this is the second edge we add.\n\n          The cycle has three edges: two of which are added and one present. The cycle is odd (length 3). \n\n          But note: we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily, so the above is valid.\n\n          However, we must ensure that the two edges we add are not already present. \n\n          How many ways to choose such a triangle? \n\n          We can choose an existing edge (u, v) (which is between two parts). Then choose a vertex w that is not adjacent to both u and v (because if w is adjacent to u or v, then we cannot add that edge). But note: the graph is bipartite, so w must be chosen from the entire graph (any vertex) except u and v.\n\n          However, note: the edge (u,w) and (v,w) must not be present. \n\n          But wait, we are forming a triangle with three vertices: u, v, w. The existing edge is (u,v). The other two edges (u,w) and (v,w) must be absent.\n\n          So for a fixed existing edge (u,v), the number of choices for w is: all vertices (except u and v) that are not adjacent to u and not adjacent to v.\n\n          But note: the graph is bipartite, so the edges from u go only to the other part (B) and from v to the other part (A). So w must be in the same part as u? or the other part? \n\n          Actually, the condition for the cycle: \n            The cycle u->v->w->u is odd (3 edges). The edges: \n              u-v: present\n              v-w: added (from B to ...? if u is in A, then v is in B, and w must be in A for the edge v-w to be from B to A (which is allowed) and then the edge u-w: from A to A (which is not allowed in the original bipartite but we are adding it, so that's okay). \n\n          But wait, the edge u-w: if w is in A, then we are adding an edge within A. The edge v-w: from B to A is an edge between parts (so originally allowed, but we are adding it so we break the bipartite). \n\n          Actually, the cycle is independent of the original bipartite structure. We are just forming a cycle.\n\n          However, the condition for the cycle to be simple is that the three vertices are distinct.\n\n          But note: the problem does not require the entire graph to be bipartite. So we can add edges arbitrarily.\n\n          So for each existing edge (u,v) (which is between two parts) and for each vertex w (w != u and w != v) such that (u,w) and (v,w) are not present, we can form a triangle by adding (u,w) and (v,w).\n\n          However, note: we are counting sets of edges. The set { (u,w), (v,w) } is one set.\n\n          But note: we must avoid double-counting? Actually, the same set of two edges can be obtained from different existing edges? \n\n          Example: Consider a triangle with edges (u,v), (v,w), (w,u). Then the set { (u,v), (v,w), (w,u) } is the triangle. But we are adding two edges. Actually, we are fixing the existing edge (u,v) and then adding (u,w) and (v,w). This set { (u,w), (v,w) } is the same regardless of the existing edge.\n\n          However, note: the triangle has three edges. We are only adding two. The third edge must be present. But the problem does not require the entire triangle to be the minimal cycle? Actually, the cycle we form is the triangle, and we are only adding two edges because the third edge is already present.\n\n          Now, the same set of two edges { (u,w), (v,w) } is uniquely determined by the existing edge (u,v) and the vertex w. But also, if we fix the two edges { (u,w), (v,w) }, then the existing edge must be (u,v). So each set of two edges that forms a triangle (with one edge already present) is uniquely associated with the existing edge (u,v) and the vertex w.\n\n          Therefore, we can count:\n\n            For each existing edge (u,v) (in the entire graph) and for each vertex w (not u or v) such that (u,w) and (v,w) are not in the graph, then we have one way.\n\n          But note: the two edges (u,w) and (v,w) must not be present. Since the graph is bipartite, the edge (u,w) is present only if w is in the opposite part of u (which is the part of v). Similarly, (v,w) is present only if w is in the opposite part of v (which is the part of u). \n\n          However, we are adding the edges arbitrarily, so we don't care about the original bipartite. But we must check the presence.\n\n          But wait: the graph is bipartite, so edges are only between the two parts. Therefore, the edge (u,w) is present if and only if u and w are in different parts. Similarly, (v,w) is present if and only if v and w are in different parts.\n\n          Therefore, the condition that (u,w) is absent is equivalent to w being in the same part as u. Similarly, (v,w) is absent if and only if w is in the same part as v. But wait, that's impossible because u and v are in different parts, so the same part for u is the opposite part of v, and same part for v is the opposite part of u. Therefore, we require w to be in the same part as u and the same part as v. But u and v are in different parts, so no w can satisfy both conditions.\n\n          Let me clarify:\n\n          Condition for (u,w) to be absent: since the graph is bipartite, the edge (u,w) is absent if w is not in the opposite part of u. But note: the graph is bipartite and initially has no edges within the same part, so (u,w) is absent if w is not the neighbor of u. However, the absence condition for (u,w) is independent of the part: actually, the graph being bipartite does not guarantee that all edges between the two parts are present. So we must check the adjacency.\n\n          Actually, we are given the graph. We know the edges. So we can simply check if the edge (u,w) is present.\n\n          But note: the problem says the graph doesn't have parallel edges and loops, and we are not to add them.\n\n          So for each existing edge (u,v) and each w (w != u, v), we check if (u,w) is present and (v,w) is present. If either is present, then we cannot use that w.\n\n          Therefore, the count for a fixed (u,v) is: \n            total_w = n - 2   (excluding u and v)\n            minus the number of w such that (u,w) is present OR (v,w) is present.\n\n          But note: if (u,w) is present, then w is adjacent to u. Similarly, if (v,w) is present, then w is adjacent to v.\n\n          However, the graph is simple, so we can compute:\n\n            adj[u] = set of neighbors of u\n            adj[v] = set of neighbors of v\n\n          Then the number of w (w != u, v) for which (u,w) is present is |adj[u]| (but excluding u and v? Actually, adj[u] does not include u, but it might include v. Since (u,v) is present, then v is in adj[u]. So the neighbors of u excluding v: |adj[u]| - 1 (if (u,v) is present, then we remove v).\n\n          Similarly, the neighbors of v excluding u: |adj[v]| - 1.\n\n          But note: there might be a common w that is adjacent to both u and v. Then we have to subtract the intersection.\n\n          So by inclusion-exclusion:\n\n            bad_w = (number of w adjacent to u excluding v) + (number of w adjacent to v excluding u) - (number of w adjacent to both u and v)\n\n          Then, the number of good w for (u,v) is: (n-2) - bad_w.\n\n          Then, the total ways for t=2 (via triangles) is the sum over all edges (u,v) (each edge considered once) of [ (n-2) - ( (|adj[u]|-1) + (|adj[v]|-1) - |adj[u] ∩ adj[v]| ) ]\n\n          However, wait: the above counts each set { (u,w), (v,w) } for each existing edge (u,v) and each w. But note: a set of two edges { (u,w), (v,w) } is uniquely defined by (u,v) and w. And we are iterating over all edges (u,v) and all w. \n\n          But note: we are allowed to add two edges arbitrarily. There might be other ways to form an odd cycle with two edges? \n\n          Possibility 2: Form a cycle of length 5 (pentagon) by adding two edges. \n\n          Example: Consider a square (a cycle of length 4) which is even. Then we can add two chords to form a pentagon? Actually, we can break the even cycle by adding two edges to form an odd cycle. However, let's see:\n\n          Suppose we have four vertices: a,b,c,d arranged in a cycle: a-b-c-d-a (even cycle). Then if we add edges a-c and b-d, we get two additional edges (the diagonals) and the graph becomes K4 (complete graph on 4 vertices). But then we have triangles (a,b,d,a) and (a,c,d,a) and (a,b,c,a)? Actually, we have triangles. \n\n          But note: we are adding two edges. The graph originally is a cycle of 4 (bipartite). Then we add two edges (the two diagonals). Then we form triangles. \n\n          However, we can also form a 5-cycle by adding two edges to a different base? \n\n          Actually, the minimal odd cycle is 3. So if we can form a triangle by adding two edges (as above) then that is the minimal t=2. But note: we are looking for the minimum t. \n\n          However, we must first check if t=1 is possible. If not, then we check t=2. \n\n          But note: the problem asks for the minimum number of edges. So if t=1 is not available, then we use t=2. \n\n          Now, is there a way to form an odd cycle by adding two edges that is not a triangle? \n\n          Example: a cycle of length 5: we need 5 edges. The graph initially has some edges. We are allowed to add two. So we need to have at least 3 edges already present (the other three edges of the pentagon). But if we don't have those, then we cannot form the pentagon by adding two edges (because we are missing three edges). \n\n          Alternatively, we can form a cycle of length 5 by adding two edges to a path of four edges? But then we need to have a path of four edges (which is a cycle of length 4, but then we break it to form a pentagon). Actually, it's complicated.\n\n          However, note: the problem requires the minimal number of edges. We have already considered t=1 (if available) and then t=0. Now, if t=1 is not available, then the next minimal is t=2. But is it always true that t=2 is sufficient?\n\n          Actually, note: we can always form a triangle by adding two edges if we have at least one existing edge (and the two edges we add are to a common vertex). However, if the graph has no edges at all, then we cannot form a triangle by adding two edges (we need three edges). Then we must consider t=3.\n\n          Therefore, we must consider:\n\n          Case 1: t=0 -> if the graph has an odd cycle.\n\n          Case 2: t=1 -> if the graph is bipartite and there exists at least one pair of vertices in the same connected component and same part (and the edge is missing).\n\n          Case 3: t=2 -> if the graph is bipartite and there is no way to add one edge, but there exists at least one way to add two edges (which forms a triangle with one existing edge). \n\n          But wait: what if the graph has no edges at all? Then we cannot form a triangle by two edges (we need three). Then we must consider t=3.\n\n          Example: n=3, m=0. Then we have three isolated vertices. We can form a triangle by adding three edges. But wait, the problem requires the minimum number of edges. \n\n          However, note: we can form an odd cycle (a triangle) by adding three edges. But is there a smaller odd cycle? No, because the smallest odd cycle is 3.\n\n          But wait: we can form a cycle of length 5 with three edges? Actually, no: a cycle of length 5 requires five edges. \n\n          Actually, we can form a cycle of length 3 (triangle) by adding three edges. \n\n          But wait, we can also form a cycle of length 5 by adding two edges? \n\n          Example: Start with three isolated vertices: A, B, C, D, E (n=5). We need to form a cycle of length 5. We can add two edges to form a path of length 3 (three edges) and then the other two edges are already present? No, we start with zero edges.\n\n          Actually, to form a cycle of length 5, we need 5 edges. Initially, we have 0, so we must add 5 edges. But that is worse than the triangle (which requires 3).\n\n          Therefore, the minimal odd cycle we can form is the triangle (if we can form one by adding three edges). \n\n          But wait: what if we form a cycle of length 5 by adding two edges? \n\n          Example: Suppose we have a path of three edges (four vertices) and we add two edges to complete a cycle of length 5? Actually, no, because a cycle of length 5 requires five edges. \n\n          However, consider: if we have a base of three edges that form a path of four vertices (a-b, b-c, c-d) and we add two edges (a-c and a-d) then we get a cycle: a-b-c-a (triangle) and also a-d-c-b-a? Actually, no: the edges we added are a-c and a-d. Then the cycle a-b-c-a is a triangle. \n\n          So the minimal odd cycle we can form is a triangle. \n\n          But note: if we have no edges, then we must add three edges to form a triangle.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal number of edges to add is:\n\n            t=0: if there is an odd cycle.\n\n            t=1: if the graph is bipartite and there exists an edge that we can add (within a connected component and same part) that forms an odd cycle.\n\n            t=2: if the graph is bipartite and there exists an existing edge (u,v) and a vertex w such that the edges (u,w) and (v,w) are not present, then we can form a triangle by adding two edges.\n\n            t=3: otherwise (if the graph has no edges and no odd cycle, but wait, if the graph is bipartite and has no edges, then we can form an odd cycle by adding three edges (a triangle) because we can choose any three vertices and add the three edges.\n\n          But note: the graph being bipartite and having no edges is a special case. \n\n          However, wait: if the graph has no edges, then it is bipartite (each component is an independent set, so two parts: the entire set). Then we can form a triangle by adding three edges (any three vertices). \n\n          But is there a way to form an odd cycle with fewer than three edges? No, because the smallest odd cycle is 3.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal number of edges is 3.\n\n          But wait: what if the graph is disconnected and has two connected components, and we can form an odd cycle by connecting two components? \n\n          Example: two separate edges (a matching). Then we have four vertices: a-b, c-d. Then we can form a cycle of length 4 (even) by connecting a-c and b-d, but that doesn't help. To form an odd cycle, we can form a triangle? We don't have three vertices connected. \n\n          Actually, we can form a triangle by choosing three vertices from one component? But each component is just two vertices (an edge). Then we have two vertices per component. We can choose two vertices from one component and one from another? \n\n          Example: take a, b from one component and c from another. Then we add edges a-c and b-c. Then the cycle: a-b (already exists) and then b-c and c-a (added) -> cycle a-b-c-a (triangle). \n\n          But note: the edge a-b is present (in the same component). Then the two edges we add are a-c and b-c. \n\n          However, the vertices a and b are in the same part (because the component is bipartite: two vertices connected by an edge, so parts: {a} and {b}). Then the edge a-c: if we don't know the part of c (which is in a different component), we can assign arbitrarily. But the cycle condition: \n            The edges: a-b (present, between parts) and then a-c and b-c (both added). The cycle has three edges, so odd.\n\n          Therefore, the above example shows that even if the graph is disconnected, we can form a triangle by adding two edges (if we choose two vertices from one component and one from another, and the two vertices from the same component are connected by an edge). \n\n          But wait: the two vertices from the same component must be connected by an edge? Actually, no: the two vertices from the same component might not be connected by an edge. \n\n          However, in the above example, they are connected. But what if the component is a single edge? Then the two vertices are connected.\n\n          Now, what if the component is a single vertex? Then we cannot form a triangle by taking two vertices from that component (there is only one). \n\n          So the general rule for t=2: \n            We need an existing edge (u,v) (which is present) and a vertex w (w not u or v) such that the edges (u,w) and (v,w) are not present.\n\n          And note: u and v are connected by an edge (so they are in the same connected component). \n\n          Therefore, if the graph has at least one edge, then we can potentially use that edge and then choose w from the rest of the graph (excluding u and v) that is not adjacent to u and not adjacent to v.\n\n          But if the graph has no edges (m=0), then we cannot use t=2 because there is no existing edge. Then we must use t=3.\n\n          So the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Check for existing odd cycle (non-bipartite component). If found, output (0, 1).\n\n          Step 2: If the graph is bipartite (all components are bipartite):\n\n            Let comp_list = list of connected components, and for each component, record the two parts (A, B).\n\n            t=0: no.\n\n            Check for t=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges required to add to an undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and the number of ways to achieve this. The solution involves checking the graph's bipartite nature and then considering different scenarios based on the graph's structure.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Odd Cycle**: The graph may already contain an odd-length cycle. If it does, no edges need to be added (t=0), and there's exactly one way to achieve this (w=1).\n\n2. **Bipartite Check**: If the graph is bipartite (no odd cycles), we proceed to find the minimal edges to add:\n   - **Case t=1**: If there exists at least one pair of vertices in the same connected component and same part (bipartite partition), adding an edge between them forms an odd cycle. The number of such pairs is calculated.\n   - **Case t=2**: If no t=1 solution exists, check if adding two edges can form a triangle (odd cycle) with an existing edge. This involves verifying for each existing edge (u, v) and each vertex w, whether edges (u, w) and (v, w) are missing.\n   - **Case t=3**: If no t=1 or t=2 solutions exist, the minimal solution is to add three edges to form a triangle from any three vertices.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    edges = []\n    index = 2\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        u = int(data[index]);

If it is not bipartite, it immediately outputs (0, 1) since an odd cycle already exists.\n2. **t=1 Calculation**: If the graph is bipartite, it calculates the number of ways to add one edge within the same part of any connected component to form an odd cycle.\n3. **t=2 Calculation**: If no t=1 solution exists, it checks for pairs of edges that, when added along with an existing edge, form a triangle (odd cycle). The calculation involves ensuring the new edges do not already exist and connect vertices appropriately.\n4. **t=3 Calculation**: If no solutions for t=1 or t=2 are found, the algorithm defaults to adding three edges to form a triangle, which is always possible in a bipartite graph with no existing edges.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all possible scenarios to determine the minimal edges required and the corresponding ways to form an odd cycle in the graph.",
