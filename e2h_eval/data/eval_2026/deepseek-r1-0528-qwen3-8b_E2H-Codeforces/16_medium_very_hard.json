Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero common border (i.e., they are adjacent across a segment of a road). Note: moving from one block to another is only allowed if the common border is nonzero, meaning we cross exactly one road? Actually, note that the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero\". But also note that the movement is defined by crossing a road. However, the key observation is:\n\n Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The entire city is divided by multiple roads. The home and the university are located in some blocks. We are to find the minimum number of steps (each step crosses one or more roads? Actually, wait: the problem says you can move from one block to another if they have a nonzero common border. That border is a segment of one or more roads? \n\n But note: two blocks are separated by one or more roads? Actually, the problem says that the roads are infinite lines and they divide the plane. The common border between two adjacent blocks must be part of one road (because two different roads would produce a crossing point, and the regions adjacent to two different roads might not share a continuous border?).\n\n However, note: the definition of an intersection is the point where at least two roads meet. The problem states that two blocks can be moved from one to the other if they have a nonzero common border. This common border is a segment of a single road (because two roads would intersect and then the region would be bounded by two roads at the intersection, so the common border would be broken? Actually, no: two adjacent blocks are separated by exactly one road. Because if two blocks are adjacent, they are separated by a portion of one road.\n\n Therefore, to go from one block to an adjacent one, you cross one road. But note: sometimes, you might need to cross multiple roads to get from one block to another? The problem says: one step is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent one (crossing one road). So the entire journey from home to university is a sequence of crossings of roads.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require us to count the number of roads crossed but the minimum number of steps. And each step crosses exactly one road (since the common border is one road segment). But wait: what if we have to cross two roads? Then we would take two steps.\n\n Observation: The entire plane is divided by the n roads. The home and university are in two blocks. The problem reduces to: what is the minimum number of roads that we must cross to go from home to university? However, note that we are allowed to cross one road per step, and we want the minimum number of steps. But is the answer simply the minimum number of roads that separate the two points?\n\n However, consider: the roads are linear and the plane is divided by multiple lines. The minimal path from home to university (in terms of crossings) is the same as the minimal number of roads that must be crossed. But note: when we cross a road, we enter a new block. So if we cross k roads, we take k steps.\n\n But wait: what if the two points are separated by an even number of roads? Then we cross an even number and take that many steps. However, the problem does not necessarily require crossing each road only once. Also, note that the roads are fixed and the two points are fixed.\n\n However, there is a catch: the problem does not require crossing each road individually. We can cross multiple roads at the same time? Actually, no: because the movement is defined by having a common border (so one contiguous segment of one road). Therefore, to go from one block to another, we only cross one road.\n\n But note: the problem does not say that we can only cross one road at a time. It says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This implies that we are crossing one road (the one forming the common border) and nothing else. However, it is possible that two roads meet at a point, and the two blocks on either side of the meeting point might be separated by two roads? Actually, no: two blocks are adjacent if they share a common border (a segment of a road). Therefore, two blocks are adjacent only if they are separated by exactly one road.\n\n So the entire journey from home to university is a path that starts in the home block and ends in the university block, and we can only move to adjacent blocks (crossing one road at a time). Therefore, the problem is equivalent to: how many roads must be crossed to get from home to university?\n\n However, note: we might have multiple ways to cross the roads. We are not restricted to crossing the roads in any particular order. But note: the roads are fixed and the two points are fixed. The minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads that must be crossed.\n\n But wait: is that correct? Consider two points and three roads. What if the two points are separated by two roads? Then we must cross two roads. However, if the two points are separated by an odd number of roads, then we must cross an odd number, and by even, then even.\n\n However, there is a known fact: the minimum number of roads to cross is the number of roads for which the two points lie on opposite sides. Why? Because if two points are on the same side of a road, then that road does not need to be crossed. If they are on opposite sides, then we must cross that road.\n\n But note: we are allowed to cross roads in any order. So the minimal number of steps is the number of roads for which the two points lie on opposite sides.\n\n However, let me test with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n        Roads: 2\n            Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0   -> y=0\n            Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0   -> x=0\n\n   How many roads separate the two points?\n        For Road1 (y=0): \n            Home: y=1 -> positive side (if we consider the equation y=0, then the side is determined by the sign of y)\n            University: y=-1 -> negative side. Opposite -> must cross.\n\n        For Road2 (x=0):\n            Home: x=1 -> positive side\n            University: x=-1 -> negative side. Opposite -> must cross.\n\n        So two roads must be crossed. Then the answer is 2.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n        Roads: 3\n            Road1: 1 0 0 -> x=0\n            Road2: 0 1 0 -> y=0\n            Road3: 1 1 -3 -> x+y-3=0\n\n        Check Road3: x+y-3=0\n            Home: 1+1-3 = -1 < 0\n            University: -1-1-3 = -5 < 0 -> same side, so no need to cross.\n\n        So only two roads must be crossed, and the answer is 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is: count the number of roads for which the two points (home and university) are on opposite sides.\n\n How to check for a road (a, b, c) and a point (x, y)? \n   The equation: ax + by + c = 0.\n   We can define a function f(x, y) = a*x + b*y + c.\n   Then, for two points p1 and p2, we check the signs of f(p1) and f(p2). If they are opposite (one positive and the other negative) then the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n However, note: the equation defines a line. The side of the line is determined by the sign. But note: the equation can be multiplied by -1 and the sides swap. So we must be cautious.\n\n Actually, we don't care about the absolute side, only whether the two points are on the same side or not. So we can do:\n\n   Let d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   Let d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n   Then, if d1 * d2 < 0, then the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n But note: what if d1 or d2 is zero? The problem states: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so d1 and d2 are nonzero.\n\n However, there is a caveat: the equation is defined up to a scalar multiple. But note: if we multiply the entire equation by a positive scalar, the signs remain the same. If we multiply by a negative scalar, the signs flip. But since we are comparing the product, we can still use the product.\n\n But wait: if we have two equations that represent the same line (but normalized differently) then our method would still work because the product condition is invariant under scaling (if we multiply both d1 and d2 by the same negative scalar, then the product d1*d2 becomes positive if originally positive, and negative if originally negative). However, the input guarantees that no two roads are the same, so we don't have to worry about duplicate lines.\n\n But note: the input gives the roads in the form a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0, and we are told that the coefficients can be negative. So we must rely on the product being negative.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n   Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n   Read n\n   For each of the next n lines:\n        Read a, b, c\n        Compute d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        Compute d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        If d1 * d2 < 0, then this road separates the two points.\n\n   Count the number of such roads.\n\n   Then output that count.\n\n However, wait: the example outputs are 2 and 2. In the first example, we found 2 separating roads. In the second example, we found 2 separating roads.\n\n But note: is that always the minimal number of steps? Because each step crosses one road, and we must cross every separating road at least once. However, we cannot avoid crossing a separating road. And we are allowed to cross non-separating roads arbitrarily? Actually, we don't need to cross non-separating roads because they don't block the direct path. However, the problem says we can only move from one block to an adjacent one (which requires crossing one road). \n\n The key is: the minimal path from home to university must cross every separating road. Moreover, we cannot cross a separating road twice (because that would be inefficient). Therefore, the minimal number of steps is exactly the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, let me consider a counterexample: \n\n   Suppose we have two roads that are not separating the two points, but together with other roads they form a barrier that requires crossing two roads even though individually they don't separate? Actually, no: the condition for a road to be separating is independent. \n\n Another way to think: the entire plane is divided by the n roads. The two points lie in two distinct regions. The minimal number of roads to cross is the number of roads that lie between the two points. And that is exactly the count of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n But wait: what if the two points are separated by two roads that are very close and we can cross them in any order? The minimal steps is still the total number of separating roads.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count of roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n However, let me test with a simple example: two points and one road. Then the minimal steps is 1.\n\n Example: \n   Home: (0,0), University: (1,1)\n   Road: x+y=1 (so equation: 1*x + 1*y -1 =0)\n\n   Then, for home: 0+0-1 = -1\n         university: 1+1-1 = 1 -> opposite -> count=1, output 1.\n\n But wait, the problem statement says that the home and university are in blocks. With one road, the plane is divided into two blocks. The home (0,0) and university (1,1) are in opposite blocks. So we must cross one road.\n\n Another example: two roads that are parallel, and the two points are separated by both.\n\n   Home: (-10,0), University: (10,0)\n   Roads: \n        Road1: x = 0 (equation: 1*x + 0*y =0)\n        Road2: x = 5 (equation: 1*x + 0*y -5 =0)\n\n   Now, check Road1: \n        Home: 1*(-10) + 0 + 0 = -10, University: 1*10+0+0=10 -> opposite -> count 1.\n   Road2: \n        Home: 1*(-10)+0-5 = -15, University: 10-5=5 -> opposite -> count 2.\n\n   So the answer is 2.\n\n But is that correct? The two roads are parallel. The home is on the left of both, the university is on the right of both. To go from home to university, we must cross both roads. Each crossing is a step. So two steps.\n\n However, note: we can cross the roads in any order. But the two roads are distinct and the path from home to university must cross both. So two steps.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: the input format has the home and university as the first two lines, then n, then n lines.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the example input is given as a list of strings in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n Example input 1:\n\n     1 1\n    -1 -1\n     2\n     0 1 0\n     1 0 0\n\n Example input 2:\n\n     1 1\n    -1 -1\n     3\n     1 0 0\n     0 1 0\n     1 1 -3\n\n But note: the first example input string is: \n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0']\n\n However, in the example, the first integer is the number of roads (n). Then the next two integers are the coefficients for each road.\n\n Let me run the example 1:\n\n   Home: (1,1)\n   University: (-1,-1)\n   n=2\n\n   Road1: 0 1 0 -> equation: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0.\n        d1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1\n        d2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1\n        product = 1 * (-1) = -1 -> opposite, so count becomes 1.\n\n   Road2: 1 0 0 -> equation: 1*x + 0*y + 0 =0 -> x=0.\n        d1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1\n        d2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1\n        product = 1*(-1) = -1 -> opposite, so count becomes 2.\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n Example 2:\n\n   Home: (1,1)\n   University: (-1,-1)\n   n=3\n\n   Road1: 1 0 0 -> x=0 -> same as above: opposite -> count=1\n   Road2: 0 1 0 -> y=0 -> same as above: opposite -> count=2\n   Road3: 1 1 -3 -> equation: x+y-3=0\n        d1 = 1+1-3 = -1\n        d2 = -1-1-3 = -5\n        product = (-1)*(-5)=5 -> positive -> same side, so no.\n\n   Output: 2.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            # Skip empty lines if any, but the problem guarantees n lines, so probably not needed.\n            continue\n        a, b, c = map(int, data)\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: what if the product d1*d2 is zero? The problem says neither home nor university is on the road, so d1 and d2 are nonzero. Therefore, the product cannot be zero. So we don't have to worry.\n\n However, note: the product d1*d2 might be very large and cause overflow? But the constraints: \n        x1,y1,x2,y2: -10^6 to 10^6\n        a,b,c: -10^6 to 10^6\n\n   So d1 and d2 can be as large as |a*x1| + |b*y1| + |c|, which is at most 10^6*(10^6) + 10^6*(10^6) + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6, which is about 2e12. The product would be up to 4e24, which is within the range of Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but we are not concerned with overflow in the mathematical sense, but we must consider performance and memory? However, n is at most 300, so we do 300 multiplications of numbers up to 4e24, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n But wait: what if the two points are on the same side, then we skip. The product is positive, and we skip.\n\n However, note: the product being negative is the condition for opposite sides.\n\n One more edge: the equation might be defined with a negative leading coefficient. But our condition (d1*d2 < 0) is independent of the sign of the entire equation.\n\n Let me test with a negative equation:\n\n   Equation: -x - y + 3 = 0 (same as x+y-3=0)\n\n   For home (1,1): -1-1+3 = 1\n   For university (-1,-1): -(-1)-(-1)+3 = 1+1+3=5\n   Product: 1*5=5 -> positive -> same side.\n\n   But wait, the equation -x-y+3=0 is the same as the original equation x+y-3=0. So the two points are on the same side as before.\n\n   Alternatively, if we use the equation: -x-y+3=0, then the home (1,1) is positive? Actually, the side depends on the sign. But note: the condition for being on the same side is that the sign of the expression is the same. The equation is just a linear form. The product being negative means that one is positive and the other negative, regardless of the overall sign.\n\n   So the condition is correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says \"It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so we don't have to worry about zeros.\n\n Let me submit the code.\n\n But wait: what if the product is negative zero? But in Python, negative zero is the same as zero? Actually, no: but d1 and d2 are computed from integer operations, so they are either positive or negative (nonzero). So no issue.\n\n I think we are done.\n\n However, wait: is there any possibility that the product might be zero even if the points are not on the road? No, because the points are not on the road, so d1 and d2 are nonzero. Therefore, the product is either positive or negative.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n But wait: the example input is provided as a list of strings in the example, but we are reading from stdin. The code above reads from stdin.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\n So we are good.\n\n Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:\n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        3\n        1 0 0\n        0 1 0\n        1 1 -3\n\n   Output: 2\n\n But wait, the example 2 in the problem statement is given as:\n\n        Input: \n            ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        Output: \n            ['2']\n\n So the code should output 2.\n\n However, note: the example input in the problem statement is given as a list of strings. But when we run the program, we read from stdin. So we just provide the input as described.\n\n But wait: the example input in the problem statement is actually two different examples. The first one is:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'] -> output '2'\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'] -> output '2'\n\n However, the example input in the problem statement is written as:\n\n        Input\n          ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        Output\n          ['2', '2']\n\n So the problem expects two answers.\n\n But note: the example input is two separate examples? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Example\n          Input\n            ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0']\n            ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n          Output\n            ['2', '2']\n\n However, in the problem statement, the example input is provided as two separate strings. But in the actual competition, we are given one input.\n\n Actually, the problem statement example is showing two different inputs and their outputs. Our code reads one set of input.\n\n Since the problem says:\n\n        The first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.\n\n        The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.\n\n        The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.\n\n        The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.\n\n So we must read until the end of the input.\n\n Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\n But note: the example input is provided as two separate examples. How will we know how many examples to process? The problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input format is as described.\n\n In competitive programming, we are usually given one input. So we assume one instance.\n\n However, the example input in the problem statement is shown as two examples. But the problem says \"Output the answer to the problem\", meaning for one instance.\n\n Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n Final code:\n\n   Read x1, y1\n   Read x2, y2\n   Read n\n   For i in range(n): read a, b, c and count the separating roads.\n\n   Print count.\n\n Let me run through the provided examples again to be sure.\n\n Example 1: \n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n        n=2\n        Road1: [0,1,0] -> d1 = 0+1+0=1, d2=0-1+0=-1 -> product=-1 -> count=1\n        Road2: [1,0,0] -> d1=1+0+0=1, d2=-1+0+0=-1 -> product=-1 -> count=2\n\n Example 2:\n        Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1)\n        n=3\n        Road1: [1,0,0] -> same as above: count becomes 1\n        Road2: [0,1,0] -> same as above: count becomes 2\n        Road3: [1,1,-3] -> d1=1+1-3=-1, d2=-1-1-3=-5 -> product=5 -> skip.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says \"Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.\" and we concluded that the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n But wait: is it possible that we can cross a separating road more than once and get a shorter path? No, because the minimal path must cross each separating road at least once, and we are allowed to cross non-separating roads arbitrarily (but why would we cross a non-separating road? It doesn't help). However, note: we are allowed to move arbitrarily in the plane. We are not constrained to a grid. The minimal steps is the minimal number of road crossings, and we must cross each separating road. And we can do that without crossing any non-separating road.\n\n Therefore, the answer is indeed the count of separating roads.\n\n I will submit the code.\n\n However, wait: what if the two points are in the same block? Then we don't need to cross any road. The count would be 0, and the steps would be 0.\n\n Example: \n        Home: (0,0), University: (0,0) -> but wait, same point? Then n roads, but the two points are the same. The problem does not guarantee that home and university are distinct. But note: the problem says \"your home is located in one of the blocks\" and \"university ... in some block\". They could be the same.\n\n        Then, for all roads: d1 = d2 (same point) -> same side for every road, so count=0.\n\n        So if the two points are the same, then we output 0.\n\n But the problem says: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", but they could be the same point and not on the road.\n\n Example: \n        Home: (0,0), University: (0,0)\n        n=1\n        Road: 1 0 0 -> equation x=0.\n        Then d1 = 0, but wait, the problem says they are not on the road. So if (0,0) is on the road, then the input guarantees that the points are not on the road. Therefore, if the two points are the same, then they are not on the road (otherwise, the input would have been invalid). But the problem states: \"It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road\".\n\n        So if the two points are the same, then they are not on the road. Then we compute d1 = a*x1+b*y1+c and d2 = a*x1+b*y1+c (same value) and d1*d2 is positive (unless d1 is zero, but then the point is on the road, which is not allowed). Therefore, if the two points are the same and not on the road, then the product is positive (and nonzero) for each road, so count=0.\n\n Therefore, the code handles that.\n\n We are ready.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that the home and university are distinct. So we must consider the possibility.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        # Since the points are not on the road, d1 and d2 are nonzero.\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road that separates the two blocks. The key observation here is that each road divides the plane into two half-planes, and the minimal path between two points (home and university) must cross every road that separates them. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads (infinite lines) separate two given points (home and university) on a plane. Each road is defined by a linear equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\). The solution hinges on checking for each road whether the two points lie on opposite sides of it. If they do, crossing that road is necessary to reach the university from home.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both points. If the product of these values is negative, the points are on opposite sides of the road, and thus the road must be crossed at least once. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves iterating through each road, evaluating the linear equation at both points, and counting the roads where the points lie on opposite sides. This count directly gives the minimal steps needed since each step corresponds to crossing one such road.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. With \\(n\\) roads (up to 300), the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    d1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    d2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if d1 * d2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first two lines read the coordinates of the home and university. The third line reads the number of roads \\(n\\).\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) of the linear equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\) are read.\n3. **Checking Sides**: The value of the equation is computed for both points. If the product of these values is negative, the points are on opposite sides of the road, and the road count is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads is printed, representing the minimal steps needed to move from home to university, as each step involves crossing one separating road.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic operations to determine the necessary crossings, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
