Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. All the letters on both diagonals must be the same (but note: the center is part of both diagonals, so we can consider the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on either diagonal) must contain the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n However, note that the problem says:\n   - On both diagonals: all letters are the same.\n   - Other squares (non-diagonal) have the same letter (but that same letter must be different from the diagonal letter).\n\n Steps:\n Let's define:\n   - The main diagonal: i == j for all i, j from 0 to n-1.\n   - The anti-diagonal: i + j == n-1.\n\n But note: the example input:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox'] -> Output: 'NO'\n\n Why? Because in the third row (index 2) the center element is 's'. The diagonals should be the same, but also the non-diagonals must be the same and different.\n\n In the provided example:\n   n=5, the grid is:\n\n   x o o o x\n   o x o x o\n   s o x o s   -> wait, the example input string has 'soxoo', so let me break it down:\n\n   Actually, the example input is given as a list of strings. The example input is:\n\n   ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n   So the grid is:\n\n   row0: 'xooox'\n   row1: 'oxoxo'\n   row2: 'soxoo'\n   row3: 'oxoxo'\n   row4: 'xooox'\n\n Now, check the diagonals:\n\n   Main diagonal: [ (0,0):'x', (1,1):'x', (2,2):'x', (3,3):'x', (4,4):'x'] -> wait, no: \n        Actually, row0: index0 -> 'x'\n        row1: index1 -> 'x' (from 'oxoxo' at index1)\n        row2: index2 -> 'x' (from 'soxoo' at index2) -> so the main diagonal is all 'x'\n\n   Anti-diagonal: [ (0,4):'x', (1,3):'x', (2,2):'x', (3,1):'x', (4,0):'x'] -> also all 'x'\n\n   Then the non-diagonal positions must be the same and different from 'x'.\n\n   Check non-diagonal positions:\n\n   For example, row0: \n        index0: diagonal -> skip\n        index1: not diagonal -> must be same letter (say 'a') and not 'x'\n        index2: not diagonal -> same letter 'a'\n        index3: same as above\n        index4: diagonal -> skip\n\n   But in row0: \n        index1: 'o'\n        index2: 'o'\n        index3: 'o'\n\n   Similarly, row1: \n        indices: 0 (diagonal? 1+0 != 4 -> no, actually wait: row1 index0: 1+0 = 1 != 4 -> not anti-diagonal, but is it main? 1==0? no, so not main either. But wait: the main diagonal requires i==j, so row1: index0: i=1, j=0 -> not main. anti-diagonal: i+j=4 -> 1+0=1 !=4 -> not anti. So row1 index0: 'o' -> okay if non-diagonal.\n\n   However, in the example input, the second row (index1) is 'oxoxo'. \n        j=0: 'o' -> non-diagonal -> must be the same letter (say 'o') and not 'x'. That matches.\n        j=1: 'x' -> main diagonal (because i=j=1) -> must be 'x'. That's correct.\n        j=2: 'o' -> non-diagonal -> must be 'o'\n        j=3: 'x' -> anti-diagonal (i+j=1+3=4) -> must be 'x'. Correct.\n        j=4: 'o' -> non-diagonal -> must be 'o'\n\n   Now, look at row2 (index2): \n        The string is 'soxoo'\n\n        Check each cell in row2 (index2):\n          j=0: i=2, j=0 -> not main (2!=0), not anti (2+0=2 !=4) -> non-diagonal -> must be 'o' (if we assume the non-diagonal letter is 'o') but we have 's' -> which is different.\n\n   Therefore, the condition fails because the non-diagonal position (2,0) is 's', while the rest non-diagonals are 'o'.\n\n   Hence, output 'NO'.\n\n   Example 2: \n        Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> Output: 'YES'\n\n   Let's check:\n\n   Grid:\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n   Diagonals:\n        Main: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> all 'w'\n        Anti: [0][2]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][0]='w' -> all 'w'\n\n   Non-diagonals: \n        [0][1] = 's'\n        [1][0] = 's', [1][2] = 's'\n        [2][1] = 's'\n\n   So non-diagonals are all 's', and 's' != 'w'. -> YES.\n\n   Example 3:\n        Input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe -> Output: 'NO'\n\n   Grid:\n        x p x\n        p x p\n        x p e\n\n   Diagonals:\n        Main: [0][0]='x', [1][1]='x', [2][2]='e' -> not all same! So already fails the diagonal condition.\n\n   However, note: the example input says:\n\n        ['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n   But wait, the third row is 'xpe', so the main diagonal would be:\n        [0][0] = 'x'\n        [1][1] = 'x'\n        [2][2] = 'e'\n\n   Since they are not the same, we don't even need to check the anti-diagonal.\n\n   However, let's check the anti-diagonal too for completeness?\n        [0][2] = 'x'\n        [1][1] = 'x'\n        [2][0] = 'x'\n\n   But the main diagonal is not all the same, so we output 'NO'.\n\n Approach:\n\n 1. Read n and then n lines.\n 2. Check that the two diagonals have the same letter. But note: the center is shared. So we can do:\n\n    Let diag1 = set of letters on main diagonal (i==j)\n    Let diag2 = set of letters on anti-diagonal (i+j == n-1)\n\n    If the sets diag1 and diag2 are not equal, then NO.\n\n    Alternatively, we can check that every letter on the main diagonal is the same, and every letter on the anti-diagonal is the same, and then these two same letters must be the same? \n\n    Actually, the condition says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". This doesn't require that the two diagonals have the same letter? \n\n    Wait, read the problem again: \n        \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n    It doesn't say the two diagonals must have the same letter? \n\n    But then look at the example: \n\n        Example 2: both diagonals are 'w'. \n\n        Example 3: main diagonal has ['x','x','e'] -> not the same, so fails.\n\n    However, what if the two diagonals have different letters? \n\n    Example: \n        n=3\n        a b c\n        d e f\n        g h i\n\n        Condition: \n          Main diagonal: a, e, i must be the same (say 'x')\n          Anti-diagonal: c, e, g must be the same (say 'y')\n\n        Then the center is e, which must be both 'x' and 'y'. So unless x==y, the center would conflict.\n\n    Therefore, the two diagonals must share the center and the entire diagonal must be the same letter. So the entire main diagonal must be one letter, and the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter, and since the center is common, the two letters must be the same.\n\n    So we can do:\n\n        Let center_letter = grid[n//2][n//2]\n\n        Then, for the main diagonal: every cell (i,i) must be center_letter.\n        For the anti-diagonal: every cell (i, n-1-i) must be center_letter.\n\n    Then, for the rest of the cells (non-diagonal): they must all be the same letter, say 'x', and that letter must not be center_letter.\n\n    Steps:\n\n    Step 1: Read the grid.\n\n    Step 2: Let center = grid[n//2][n//2]\n\n    Step 3: Check the main diagonal (i from 0 to n-1): for each i, grid[i][i] must be center.\n\n    Step 4: Check the anti-diagonal (i from 0 to n-1): for each i, grid[i][n-1-i] must be center.\n\n    Step 5: Now, check all the other cells (non-diagonal). We need to know the letter that is supposed to be in the non-diagonals. But note: the problem says \"all other squares ... contain the same letter\", so we can pick any non-diagonal cell and then check that all non-diagonal cells are that letter and that letter is not center.\n\n    However, there might be no non-diagonal cell (if n==1, but n>=3). \n\n    How to do step 5?\n\n        Let candidate = None\n        For i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue   # skip diagonal\n                else:\n                    if candidate is None:\n                        candidate = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != candidate:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            exit(0)\n\n        But wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Then we don't set candidate and that's okay? But n>=3, so there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n        However, we must also check that candidate != center.\n\n    But note: what if the grid has non-diagonal cells with two different letters? Then we catch that in the above.\n\n    However, there's a catch: what if the grid has non-diagonal cells that are not all the same? Then we break.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Step 2: Check diagonals with center.\n\n        Step 3: Collect the set of letters from non-diagonal cells.\n\n        If the set has more than one letter, then NO.\n\n        And if the set has one letter, then check that letter != center.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"all other squares ... contain the same letter\", so the set must have exactly one distinct letter.\n\n    However, we can do:\n\n        non_diag_letters = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                non_diag_letters.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        Then, if len(non_diag_letters) != 1 or (len(non_diag_letters)==1 and next(iter(non_diag_letters)) == center_letter):\n            then NO.\n\n        But wait: the condition is that the non-diagonal letter must be the same and different from center.\n\n        So if non_diag_letters has one element, say 'a', then we require 'a' != center_letter.\n\n    However, there is an edge: what if the grid is 3x3 and the non-diagonals are all 'a' and center is 'a'? Then the condition fails because non-diagonal letter must be different from the diagonal letter.\n\n    Therefore, the conditions are:\n\n        Condition 1: All main diagonal elements are center_letter.\n        Condition 2: All anti-diagonal elements are center_letter.\n        Condition 3: All non-diagonal elements are the same letter (call it 'a') and 'a' != center_letter.\n\n    But note: Condition 1 and 2 imply that the entire two diagonals are center_letter.\n\n    However, what if the grid is:\n\n        a a a\n        a a a\n        a a a\n\n    Then Condition 1: yes, because main diagonal: [0][0]='a', [1][1]='a', [2][2]='a' -> same. Anti-diagonal: [0][2]='a', [1][1]='a', [2][0]='a' -> same. Then Condition 3: non-diagonals are all 'a', but then Condition 3 requires that the non-diagonal letter is the same and different from center_letter (which is 'a'). -> fails.\n\n    So that grid would be \"NO\", which is correct because the entire grid is the same letter, but the problem requires the non-diagonals to be a different letter.\n\n    Another example:\n\n        a a a\n        a b a\n        a a a\n\n    Here, Condition 1: main diagonal: [0][0]='a', [1][1]='b', [2][2]='a' -> not the same. So Condition 1 fails.\n\n    Therefore, we must check Condition 1 and Condition 2 first.\n\n    Algorithm:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            line = input().strip()\n            grid.append(line)\n\n        center = grid[n//2][n//2]\n\n        # Check main diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != center:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != center:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Now, check non-diagonals\n        # We'll traverse and collect the non-diagonal letters, but we don't need to store all, we can check that all non-diagonals are the same and not center.\n\n        # But note: what if the grid has a mix of two different non-diagonal letters? Then we break.\n\n        # We can do:\n\n        # Let candidate = None\n        # for i in range(n):\n        #   for j in range(n):\n        #       if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n        #           continue\n        #       if candidate is None:\n        #           candidate = grid[i][j]\n        #       elif grid[i][j] != candidate:\n        #           print(\"NO\")\n        #           exit(0)\n\n        # Then check candidate != center.\n\n        # However, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Then we never set candidate and we get an error. But n>=3, so there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        # Create a set for non-diagonal letters, but we only care if they are the same.\n\n        # But the above loop will break as soon as we find two different non-diagonal letters.\n\n        # After the loop, if we found at least one non-diagonal cell, then we must check candidate != center.\n\n        # However, what if there is at least one non-diagonal cell? Then candidate is set. But what if the grid is 3x3 and the non-diagonal cells are all the same? Then we pass.\n\n        # But note: the above loop does not check the entire grid for consistency of non-diagonals? Actually, the loop breaks on the first inconsistency.\n\n        # However, we must ensure that the non-diagonals are all the same. The above loop does that by setting candidate and then checking against it.\n\n        # But wait: what if we have:\n\n        #   a a a\n        #   a b a\n        #   a a a\n\n        # This grid fails the diagonal condition (main diagonal: [0][0]='a', [1][1]='b', [2][2]='a' -> not all 'a') so we never get to the non-diagonal part.\n\n        # So we are safe.\n\n        # However, we must consider that the grid might be large (n<300, so maximum 299x299, which is about 90000 cells). The above double loop for non-diagonals is O(n^2) which is acceptable for n<300 (max 300*300=90000).\n\n        # But note: we already did two loops of n (each of length n) for the diagonals. So total operations: 2*n + (n*n - 2*n + 1) [the center is counted once in the diagonals] but actually we don't count the center twice in the diagonals? \n\n        # Actually, the two diagonal checks are two separate loops, each of size n. Then the non-diagonal loop is (n*n - 2*n + 1) because the two diagonals together have 2*n-1 cells (since the center is shared). \n\n        # So overall, we are doing 2*n + (n*n - 2*n + 1) = n^2 + 1 operations? Actually, the two diagonal loops are 2*n, and the non-diagonal loop is n*n - (2*n - 1). \n\n        # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        #   non_diag_set = set()\n        #   for i in range(n):\n        #       for j in range(n):\n        #           if i != j and i+j != n-1:\n        #               non_diag_set.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        #   Then check len(non_diag_set) == 1 and (the one element != center)\n\n        # But this is also acceptable.\n\n        # However, the problem says that the non-diagonals must be the same, so we can break early if we find two different ones.\n\n        # Let's do the early break version.\n\n        # But note: what if the non-diagonals are all the same but the set has one element? Then the set method is better because we don't have to remember the candidate.\n\n        # Actually, the two methods are similar in worst-case performance. The set method may add many elements and then check the size, but worst-case we have to go through all non-diagonal cells.\n\n        # Since n can be up to 299, the maximum number of non-diagonal cells is about 299*299 - 2*299 + 1 = around 89000 - 598 + 1 ~ 88400, which is acceptable in Python for a single run.\n\n        # However, the problem says n is odd and at least 3 and less than 300.\n\n        # But we can do:\n\n        # Option 1: Two loops for diagonals (each n steps) and then one big loop for non-diagonals (n*n steps). Total steps: 2*n + n*n, which is acceptable for n<300.\n\n        # Option 2: We can also check the non-diagonals by doing:\n\n        #   non_diag_char = None\n        #   for i in range(n):\n        #       for j in range(n):\n        #           if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n        #               continue\n        #           if non_diag_char is None:\n        #               non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n        #           else:\n        #               if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n        #                   print(\"NO\")\n        #                   exit(0)\n\n        #   Then check non_diag_char != center.\n\n        # But wait: what if the grid has no non-diagonal cell? Then non_diag_char remains None. For n>=3, there are non-diagonal cells. However, if n=1, then no non-diagonal, but n>=3.\n\n        # So we can do:\n\n        #   if non_diag_char is None:\n        #       # then there are no non-diagonal cells -> then the grid must be 1x1? but n>=3, so this won't happen.\n        #       print(\"NO\")   # Actually, the condition fails because the non-diagonals must be present and same? But the problem says \"all other squares\", meaning if there are no other squares then the condition holds? But the problem states n>=3, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        # However, the problem says n>=3, so we can assume non_diag_char is set.\n\n        # But note: the problem says the non-diagonals must be the same and different from the diagonal. If there are no non-diagonals, then the condition is vacuously true for the same? But the problem says \"all other squares ... contain the same letter\", and if there are no other squares, then the condition holds. But then the letter must be different from the diagonal? There is no letter to compare. \n\n        # However, the problem states: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\".\n\n        # If there are no other squares, then the condition about the same letter is trivially true (there are no other squares to have different letters). But the condition also says \"that is different from the letters on the diagonals\". There is no letter specified for the non-diagonals. \n\n        # Let me re-read: \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n        # If there are no other squares, then the statement is: \"all other squares (which don't exist) contain the same letter (which we can call X) and X is different from the diagonal letter\". \n\n        # This is a logical implication: the set of non-diagonal squares is empty, so the statement \"for all non-diagonal squares, they contain the same letter\" is true. Then the additional condition is that that letter (if we were to assign one) must be different from the diagonal letter. But note: the problem says \"contain the same letter that is different\", meaning the same letter (which is fixed) and that letter is different from the diagonal.\n\n        # However, if there are no non-diagonal squares, then we don't have a letter to assign. The problem does not specify what to do in that case. But note: n>=3, so we don't have to consider n=1.\n\n        # But wait, what if n=3? Then the non-diagonals are the corners and the middle of the sides? Actually, for n=3, the non-diagonals are the 4 corners and the center is shared. Actually, for n=3:\n\n        #   Positions: \n        #       (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n        #       (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n        #       (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n        #   Diagonals: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) and (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So four cells.\n\n        # Therefore, we must have at least one non-diagonal cell for n>=3.\n\n        # So we can safely assume non_diag_char is set.\n\n        # However, the above candidate setting loop does not check the entire grid for consistency? Actually, it does: we set candidate to the first non-diagonal and then every subsequent non-diagonal must match.\n\n        # But there's a catch: what if the grid has two different non-diagonal letters, but the first one we see is one letter, then we see the other? Then we break and output \"NO\".\n\n        # Now, the last condition: candidate != center.\n\n        # But note: what if the non-diagonal cells are the same but that same letter is center? Then we output \"NO\".\n\n        # Example: \n        #   n=3\n        #   a b a\n        #   b c b\n        #   a b a\n\n        #   Condition 1: main diagonal: [a, c, a] -> must be same. So unless a==c, fails.\n        #   Condition 2: anti-diagonal: [a, c, a] -> same as main, so unless a==c, fails.\n\n        #   Then Condition 3: non-diagonals: the corners and the middle of the sides: \n        #       (0,1): 'b', (1,0):'b', (1,2):'b', (2,1):'b'. So candidate='b'. \n        #       Then we check candidate != center? center is c. So if a==c, then center is a (or c, same) and candidate is b. Then we require b != a -> which is true if a != b.\n\n        #   But wait, if a==c, then the grid is:\n\n        #       a b a\n        #       b a b\n        #       a b a\n\n        #   Then Condition 1: main diagonal: [a, a, a] -> ok. Condition 2: anti-diagonal: [a, a, a] -> ok. Condition 3: non-diagonals are all 'b' and 'b' != 'a' -> YES.\n\n        #   Example: \n        #       n=3\n        #       a b a\n        #       b a b\n        #       a b a\n\n        #   Output: YES.\n\n        #   However, if we set a='x', b='y', then:\n\n        #       x y x\n        #       y x y\n        #       x y x\n\n        #   Then output YES.\n\n        #   But what if we set a='x', b='x'? Then:\n\n        #       x x x\n        #       x x x\n        #       x x x\n\n        #   Then Condition 1: main diagonal: [x,x,x] -> ok. Condition 2: anti-diagonal: [x,x,x] -> ok. Condition 3: non-diagonals are all 'x', but then we require non-diagonal letter != center_letter (which is x) -> fails.\n\n        #   So output NO.\n\n        # So the code:\n\n        #   n = int(input().strip())\n        #   grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n        #   center = grid[n//2][n//2]\n\n        #   # Check main diagonal\n        #   for i in range(n):\n        #       if grid[i][i] != center:\n        #           print(\"NO\")\n        #           exit(0)\n\n        #   # Check anti-diagonal\n        #   for i in range(n):\n        #       if grid[i][n-1-i] != center:\n        #           print(\"NO\")\n        #           exit(0)\n\n        #   # Check non-diagonals\n        #   candidate = None\n        #   for i in range(n):\n        #       for j in range(n):\n        #           if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n        #               continue\n        #           if candidate is None:\n        #               candidate = grid[i][j]\n        #           else:\n        #               if grid[i][j] != candidate:\n        #                   print(\"NO\")\n        #                   exit(0)\n\n        #   # Now candidate is set (unless n==1, but n>=3) and we require candidate != center.\n        #   if candidate == center:\n        #       print(\"NO\")\n        #   else:\n        #       print(\"YES\")\n\n    However, wait: what if the grid has non-diagonal cells that are all the same but we didn't set candidate because we broke early? Actually, we set candidate only when we find a non-diagonal cell. And we break if we find a different one.\n\n    But note: the above code sets candidate only for the first non-diagonal cell. Then we break if we find a different one. Then we check candidate != center.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    But wait: what if the grid is:\n\n        a a a\n        a a a\n        a a a\n\n    Then the diagonals: \n        main: [a,a,a] -> ok\n        anti: [a,a,a] -> ok\n\n        Then non-diagonals: \n            We start at (0,0): diagonal -> skip\n            (0,1): non-diagonal -> candidate = grid[0][1] = 'a'\n            Then (0,2): diagonal -> skip\n            (1,0): non-diagonal -> check: grid[1][0] = 'a' -> same as candidate, so continue.\n            (1,1): diagonal -> skip\n            (1,2): non-diagonal -> same 'a'\n            (2,0): diagonal -> skip\n            (2,1): non-diagonal -> same 'a'\n            (2,2): diagonal -> skip\n\n        Then candidate is 'a'. Then we check candidate == center -> center is 'a' -> then print \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n    Another test: the example 2:\n\n        n=3\n        grid = ['wsw','sws','wsw']\n\n        center = grid[1][1] = 'w'\n\n        Check main diagonal: \n            [0][0] = 'w' -> ok\n            [1][1] = 'w' -> ok\n            [2][2] = 'w' -> ok\n\n        Check anti-diagonal:\n            [0][2] = 'w' -> ok\n            [1][1] = 'w' -> ok\n            [2][0] = 'w' -> ok\n\n        Then non-diagonals:\n            (0,1): 's' -> candidate='s'\n            (1,0): 's' -> same\n            (1,2): 's' -> same\n            (2,1): 's' -> same\n\n        Then candidate='s' and center='w', so 's' != 'w' -> YES.\n\n    Example 3:\n\n        n=3\n        grid = ['xpx','pxp','xpe']\n\n        center = grid[1][1] = 'x'\n\n        Check main diagonal:\n            [0][0] = 'x' -> ok\n            [1][1] = 'x' -> ok\n            [2][2] = 'e' -> not 'x' -> print \"NO\"\n\n    Example 4: the provided example 1:\n\n        n=5, grid as given.\n\n        center = grid[2][2] = 's'\n\n        Check main diagonal: \n            [0][0] = 'x' -> but center is 's' -> fails.\n\n        But wait, in the example input, the main diagonal was all 'x'? \n\n        Let me recheck the example input:\n\n            Input: ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n            So the grid:\n\n            row0: 'xooox' -> [0][0] = 'x'\n            row1: 'oxoxo' -> [1][1] = 'x'\n            row2: 'soxoo' -> [2][2] = 'x' -> wait, the example input says row2 is 'soxoo', so the third character (index2) is 'x'. \n\n            Correction: \n                row0: index0: 'x'\n                row1: index1: the second character (index1) is 'x' (because the string is 'oxoxo': index0='o', index1='x', index2='o', index3='x', index4='o')\n                row2: index2: the third character is 'x' (because the string is 'soxoo': index0='s', index1='o', index2='x', index3='o', index4='o') -> wait, no, the example input row2 is 'soxoo'. \n\n            Actually, the example input is:\n\n                ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n            So:\n\n                row0: 'xooox' -> ['x','o','o','o','x']\n                row1: 'oxoxo' -> ['o','x','o','x','o']\n                row2: 'soxoo' -> ['s','o','x','o','o']\n                row3: 'oxoxo' -> ['o','x','o','x','o']\n                row4: 'xooox' -> ['x','o','o','o','x']\n\n            Therefore, the main diagonal:\n\n                [0][0] = 'x'\n                [1][1] = 'x'\n                [2][2] = 'x'\n                [3][3] = 'x'\n                [4][4] = 'x'\n\n            So the main diagonal is all 'x'.

The non-diagonal cell (2,0) is 's'. \n\n        However, the example input string was written as 'soxoo', so the first character is 's'. \n\n        But note: the example input example 1 is:\n\n            Input: ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n        So the code correctly identifies the 's' and outputs \"NO\".\n\n    However, wait: the example input says:\n\n        Example 1: ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox'] -> Output: 'NO'\n\n        Example 2: ['3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'] -> Output: 'YES'\n\n        Example 3: ['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe'] -> Output: 'NO'\n\n    But in our code, for example 1 we break because the non-diagonal cell (2,0) is 's' (which is different from candidate 'o'). \n\n    However, the example input example 1 is expected to output \"NO\", which we do.\n\n    But wait, the example input example 1 was provided as:\n\n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n    and our code outputs \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n    However, note: the example input example 1 was initially described as:\n\n        \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\"\n\n        and then the example input is given as:\n\n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n        and the expected output is:\n\n        ['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\n    Therefore, the code is as below.\n\n    One more corner: what if the grid has two different non-diagonal letters, but the first non-diagonal letter we encounter is the same as the center? \n\n    Example:\n\n        n=3\n        grid = [\n            'abc',\n            'def',\n            'ghi'\n        ]\n\n        But wait, we are reading the grid from stdin. Let me take:\n\n        a b c\n        d e f\n        g h i\n\n        center = e\n\n        Check diagonals: \n            a, e, i must be same -> so if e is set, then a, e, i must be e.\n            Similarly, c, e, g must be",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** First, we read the integer `n` which represents the size of the grid (an odd number). Then, we read `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Check Diagonals:** The main diagonal consists of cells where the row index equals the column index (i.e., `grid[i][i]`). The anti-diagonal consists of cells where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1` (i.e., `grid[i][n-1-i]`). All letters on both diagonals must be the same as the center letter (located at `[n//2][n//2]`).\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells:** All cells not on either diagonal must contain the same letter, which must differ from the diagonal letter. We traverse the grid, skipping diagonal cells, and verify that all non-diagonal cells have the same letter and that this letter is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        grid.append(input().strip())\n    \n    center = grid[n//2][n//2]\n    \n    # Check main diagonal\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != center:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != center:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    candidate = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if candidate is None:\n                candidate = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != candidate:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if candidate == center:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading:** The code starts by reading the grid size `n` and then reads `n` lines to construct the grid.\n2. **Center Letter:** The center letter is identified as `grid[n//2][n//2]` since `n` is odd.\n3. **Diagonal Checks:** The code checks all elements on the main diagonal (where `i == j`) and the anti-diagonal (where `i + j == n - 1`). If any element on these diagonals does not match the center letter, it immediately prints \"NO\" and exits.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Check:** The code then checks all other cells (non-diagonal) to ensure they contain the same letter. The first non-diagonal cell sets the candidate letter, and subsequent non-diagonal cells must match this candidate. If any non-diagonal cell differs, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n5. **Final Check:** After verifying all non-diagonal cells are the same, the code checks if this candidate letter is different from the center letter. If they are the same, it prints \"NO\"; otherwise, it prints \"YES\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies all conditions required to determine if the grid forms an \"X\", ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
