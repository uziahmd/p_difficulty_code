    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given an integer p (0 <= p <= 200000). We need to find:\n  1. The minimum number of nodes n such that there exists a directed graph with n nodes that is p-reachable.\n     - A graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v are mutually reachable.\n\n  2. Among all such graphs with n nodes, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs (u, v) (with u != v, path from u to v but not from v to u).\n\n Observation:\n\n In a directed graph, mutual reachability (i.e., strongly connected components) is key.\n\n Let the graph have k strongly connected components (SCCs). Then, the entire graph can be represented as a DAG of these SCCs.\n\n Condition for mutual reachability: \n   - Within an SCC, every node is mutually reachable with every other node. So, if an SCC has size s, then it contributes C(s,2) = s*(s-1)//2 unordered pairs (but note: the problem counts ordered pairs? Actually, note the definition: \"exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other\".\n\n However, note: the problem says \"ordered pairs\" but then specifies \"u < v\". But wait, the condition for being mutually reachable is symmetric. For two distinct nodes u and v in the same SCC, we have both (u,v) and (v,u) are paths? But the problem counts only the ordered pair (u, v) with u < v. So for one SCC of size s, the number of pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutually reachable is C(s,2) = s*(s-1)//2.\n\n But note: the graph might have multiple SCCs. The entire graph must have exactly p such pairs.\n\n Also, note that if two nodes are in different SCCs, they are not mutually reachable (unless there's a cycle connecting them, but by definition of SCC, the graph of SCCs is a DAG so no cycles between components). Therefore, the total number of mutual pairs (for u < v) is the sum over each SCC of C(size_i, 2).\n\n Now, we want the minimum number of nodes n (which is the sum of the sizes of the SCCs) such that the sum of C(size_i, 2) over the SCCs is exactly p.\n\n Moreover, we are allowed to choose the partition of n into positive integers (each component has at least one node) such that the sum of C(size_i, 2) is at least p? Actually, we require exactly p. But note: we are free to arrange the graph arbitrarily (as long as the SCC structure is as chosen). However, we are also going to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n However, the problem says: \"minimum number of nodes required\" and then \"among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, maximize the number of unidirectional pairs\".\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the smallest n (number of nodes) such that there exists a way to partition n into positive integers (the sizes of the SCCs) so that the sum of C(size_i,2) is at least p? Actually, we require exactly p. But note: we can also consider that we don't necessarily have to use all n nodes in the mutual pairs? Actually, the entire graph must have exactly p mutual pairs (with u < v). \n\n However, note: the mutual pairs are only within the same SCC. And the graph can have multiple SCCs. The total mutual pairs is the sum over the SCCs of C(size_i,2). We must have this sum equal to p.\n\n But wait: we are allowed to have more than one way to assign the edges? Actually, we can design the graph arbitrarily (with the constraint of having exactly p mutual pairs). However, the minimal n must be such that there exists a partition of n (into k parts) such that the sum of C(size_i,2) is p.\n\n However, note: we are not forced to use all the n nodes in forming the mutual pairs? Actually, we must form exactly p mutual pairs (for u < v). The rest of the nodes (if any) can be arranged arbitrarily? But note: the graph must be p-reachable, meaning the entire set of mutual pairs (for u < v) is exactly p.\n\n But observe: the mutual pairs are defined by the SCCs. The entire graph is partitioned into SCCs, and the mutual pairs are the pairs (u,v) with u < v that lie in the same SCC. Therefore, the total mutual pairs is fixed by the sizes of the SCCs.\n\n Therefore, we need to represent p as the sum of",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required in a directed graph such that there are exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` where `u < v` and both `u` and `v` are mutually reachable. Additionally, among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, we need to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs (pairs where there is a path from `u` to `v` but not vice versa).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Mutual Reachability**: In a directed graph, mutual reachability between two nodes `u` and `v` implies they belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC). The number of mutual pairs for an SCC of size `s` is given by the combination formula `C(s, 2) = s*(s-1)/2`.\n\n2. **Partitioning Nodes into SCCs**: The problem reduces to partitioning `n` nodes into `k` SCCs such that the sum of `C(size_i, 2)` for all SCCs equals `p`. The goal is to find the smallest `n` for which such a partition exists.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: For graphs with the minimum `n`, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs. This involves structuring the graph such that as many edges as possible exist in one direction between different SCCs while maintaining the required mutual reachability within SCCs.\n\n4. **Mathematical Formulation**: The solution involves:\n   - Finding the smallest `n` such that the sum of `C(size_i, 2)` for some partition of `n` equals `p`.\n   - Calculating the maximum number of unidirectional pairs by considering the edges between SCCs in a way that maximizes one-directional paths.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n        \n    n = 1\n    total_pairs = 0\n    while True:\n        needed = p - total_pairs\n        if needed <= 0:\n            break\n        if needed == 1:\n            n += 1\n            break\n        n += 1\n        total_pairs += n * (n - 1) // 2\n    else:\n        n -= 1\n        total_pairs -= n * (n - 1) // 2\n        needed = p - total_pairs\n        n += 1\n        total_pairs += n * (n - 1) // 2\n        if total_pairs != p:\n            n -= 1\n            total_pairs -= n * (n - 1) // 2\n            \n    k = 0\n    m = n\n    s = [1] * m\n    \n    total_mutual = 0\n    for i in range(m):\n        total_mutual += s[i] * (s[i] - 1) // 2\n        \n    while total_mutual < p:\n        if k >= m:\n            break\n        s[k] += 1\n        total_mutual += k\n        k += 1\n        \n    if total_mutual != p:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n        return\n        \n    components = []\n    current = 0\n    for i in range(m):\n        current += s[i]\n        components.append(current)\n        \n    num_edges = 0\n    for i in range(len(components)):\n        for j in range(len(components)):\n            if i != j:\n                num_edges += components[i] * components[j]\n                \n    max_unidirectional = num_edges - p\n    print(f\"{n} {max_unidirectional}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Finding Minimum Nodes (`n`)**:\n   - The loop increments `n` starting from 1 and calculates the cumulative sum of `C(n, 2)` until the sum meets or exceeds `p`. The exact `n` is adjusted if the sum exceeds `p`.\n\n2. **Partitioning into SCCs**:\n   - The nodes are partitioned into `m` SCCs, each initially of size 1. The algorithm then adjusts the sizes of these SCCs to ensure the sum of their mutual pairs equals `p`.\n\n3. **Calculating Unidirectional Pairs**:\n   - The total possible edges between all pairs of nodes is computed. The unidirectional pairs are derived by subtracting the mutual pairs (`p`) from the total possible edges between different SCCs.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal graph structure that meets the problem's requirements and maximizes the desired unidirectional pairs.",
