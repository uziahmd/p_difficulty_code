A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. They have k bottles -> total drink = k * l milliliters.\n For a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. But note: the toasts are for the entire group? Actually, the problem says:\n \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. But they want to make toasts such that each friend gets the same amount.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total available drink in milliliters: total_drink = k * l\n 2. Calculate the total available lime slices: from c limes, each cut into d slices -> total_slices = c * d\n\n 3. Now, for one toast, we need:\n    - drink: nl milliliters (per friend per toast) but note: the entire group is making the same number of toasts per friend?\n    Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n\n    But wait: if we are making T toasts per friend, then the total drink required is n * T * nl.\n    Similarly, for salt: total salt required is n * T * np.\n    And for lime: total slices required is n * T (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can think: \n    - The drink limits the total number of toasts (per friend) as: floor(total_drink / (n * nl))\n    - The lime limits: floor(total_slices / n)   [because each toast per friend requires one slice, and there are n friends so total slices needed is n * T]\n    - The salt limits: floor(p / (n * np))\n\n 5. However, note: the drink requirement is per friend per toast. So for T toasts per friend, we need:\n    - Drink: T * n * nl <= k * l  => T <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n    - Lime: T * n <= c * d        => T <= (c * d) / n\n    - Salt: T * n * np <= p       => T <= p / (n * np)\n\n 6. Therefore, the maximum T (toasts per friend) is the minimum of these three values, but we must take integer part (floor) because we can't have fractions of a toast.\n\n But note: the example input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n   n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n   Total drink: 4*5 = 20\n   Drink constraint: T <= 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> floor is 2.\n\n   Lime slices: 10*8 = 80\n   Lime constraint: T <= 80 / 3 ≈ 26.66 -> floor 26? But wait, the example says: min(6,80,100)/3 = 2.\n\n   Let me reexamine the example:\n\n   The example says:\n      drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (for the entire group? Actually, no: the example says 6 toasts for the entire group? But wait, the example says:\n\n      \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n   But note: 3 friends, each toast requires 3 ml for each friend? Then for one toast, the entire group would require 3 * 3 = 9 ml? \n\n   However, the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n\n   So for one toast, the entire group requires n * nl ml.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of toasts (for the entire group) is limited by the drink: floor(total_drink / (nl * n))?\n\n   But wait, the example says: drink is 20 ml, and each toast (for the entire group) requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Then 20 / 9 = 2.22 -> 2 toasts for the entire group.\n\n   Then each friend gets 2 toasts (because the entire group makes 2 toasts, and each friend drinks at each toast).\n\n   However, the example calculation says: \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n   Here, 6 comes from: 20 / 3 (which is the drink per toast per friend). But note: 3 ml per friend per toast, so for the entire group 3*3=9 ml per toast. Then why did they say 20/3=6?\n\n   Let me read the example again: \n      \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n   This suggests they are considering that one toast for the entire group uses 3 ml (not 3 ml per friend)? \n\n   But the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. So one toast (for the entire group) requires n * nl ml.\n\n   In the example, nl=3, so one toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml. Then 20 / 9 = 2.22 -> 2 toasts.\n\n   However, the example calculation does 20/3 (without multiplying by n). That seems inconsistent.\n\n   Let me check the example output: the answer is 2. \n\n   There are two interpretations:\n\n   Interpretation 1 (as per the example calculation): \n      - The drink: 20 ml. Each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml. But wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", meaning for one toast per friend, so for one toast (for the entire group) we need n * nl.\n\n   Interpretation 2 (from the example calculation): \n      - They are calculating the total number of toasts (across all friends) that can be made from the drink: 20 / 3 (because each toast requires 3 ml for one friend). But then the entire group is making the same number of toasts. \n\n   How does that work?\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. \n\n   If we have T toasts per friend, then the total drink consumed is T * n * nl.\n\n   Alternatively, if we consider the entire group's toasting: one toast for the entire group is when every friend drinks one toast. So one toast event (for the entire group) requires n * nl ml.\n\n   Now, the example calculation does:\n\n      drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (if we think of 3 ml per toast for the entire group, that doesn't match because the entire group toast requires 9 ml).\n\n   But wait, the example input specifies nl=3, so per friend per toast 3 ml. Then one entire-group toast (all friends having one toast) requires 3 ml * 3 friends = 9 ml.\n\n   Then the drink can support 20 / 9 = 2 entire-group toasts.\n\n   Then each friend gets 2 toasts.\n\n   However, the example calculation says: min(6,80,100) / 3 = 2.\n\n   How did they get 6 from the drink? They did 20 / 3 = 6. This 3 is nl (the per-friend requirement). But then they divide by the number of friends (3) to get the per-friend toasts.\n\n   Alternatively, let me break down the example:\n\n   Total drink = 20 ml.\n   Each friend requires 3 ml per toast. But the entire group is going to have the same number of toasts.\n\n   Let T be the number of toasts per friend.\n\n   Then the total drink required is T * n * nl = T * 3 * 3 = 9T.\n\n   We require 9T <= 20 -> T <= 20/9 -> T=2.\n\n   Similarly, lime: each friend requires one slice per toast, so total slices = T * n = 3T. We have 10*8=80 slices -> 3T<=80 -> T<=80/3 ~26.66 -> T=26 (but wait, 3*26=78 which is <=80) but then we have to consider the drink and salt.\n\n   Salt: each friend requires np=1 gram per toast, so total salt = T * n * np = 3T * 1 = 3T. We have 100 grams -> 3T<=100 -> T<=100/3 ~33.33 -> T=33.\n\n   Then the limiting factor is the drink: T=2.\n\n   Now, the example says: \n        drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (here 3 is nl, the per-friend requirement) but then divided by the number of friends (3) gives 2.\n\n   What they did is: \n        From drink: total_drink / (nl) = 20 / 3 = 6. This 6 is the total number of toasts that can be served if we were only serving one friend? But then we have multiple friends.\n\n   Actually, the example says: \n        \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n   Then they say: \"However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\n   This implies that the 6 is the total number of toasts (across all friends) that the drink can support? But wait, if one toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml, then 20 ml can make 20/3 ~6 toasts (each toast being for one friend). But then we have 3 friends, and they want to drink the same number. \n\n   How many toasts can we have in total? 6. Then we divide by the number of friends (3) to get 2 toasts per friend.\n\n   But wait, that would mean that the entire group's total toasts is 6. Since each friend must have the same number, the maximum T per friend is floor(6 / 3) = 2.\n\n   However, this interpretation is inconsistent with the requirement: because for T toasts per friend, we require T * n * nl ml. \n\n   But note: if we consider the drink, we have 20 ml. Each toast (one friend having one toast) requires 3 ml. So total toasts (counting each friend's toast individually) is 20/3 = 6. Then we must distribute these 6 toasts equally among 3 friends: each gets 6/3 = 2.\n\n   However, is this consistent with the lime and salt?\n\n   For lime: total_slices = 80. Each toast (one friend) requires 1 slice. So total toasts (individual) is limited by 80. Then we have 80/3 ~26.66 -> so maximum total toasts is 26 (if we use integer division) but wait, we are distributing equally. \n\n   Actually, we cannot exceed the total available resources. The total toasts (across friends) cannot exceed:\n\n        total_toasts = min( (total_drink // nl), (total_slices), (p // np) )\n\n   Then the per-friend toasts is total_toasts // n.\n\n   But wait, the drink: each toast (one friend) uses nl ml, so the total toasts (by any friend) is limited by total_drink // nl.\n\n   Similarly, lime: each toast (one friend) uses 1 slice, so total toasts is limited by total_slices.\n\n   Salt: each toast (one friend) uses np grams, so total toasts is limited by p // np.\n\n   Then the maximum total toasts (across all friends) is T_total = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np)\n\n   Then each friend can make T_total // n toasts.\n\n   Let's test with the example:\n\n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n        total_drink = 4*5 = 20\n        total_slices = 10*8 = 80\n\n        T_total = min(20//3, 80, 100//1) \n                 = min(6, 80, 100) = 6\n\n        Then per friend: 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Why is the drink constraint 20//3? Because 20//3 is 6 (using integer floor division). But note: 20/3 is 6.66..., so floor is 6.\n\n   Now, second example: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n        Input: n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n        total_drink = 100*10 = 1000\n        total_slices = 1*19 = 19\n        total_salt = 90\n\n        Constraints for total toasts (across friends) by drink: 1000 // 4 = 250\n        by lime: 19\n        by salt: 90 // 3 = 30\n\n        T_total = min(250, 19, 30) = 19\n\n        Then per friend: 19 // 5 = 3 (since 19//5 is 3 in integer division)\n\n        Output: 3.\n\n   Third example: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n\n        n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1.\n\n        total_drink = 1000*1000 = 1000000\n        total_slices = 25*23 = 575\n        total_salt = 1\n\n        Constraints:\n            drink: 1000000 // 50 = 20000\n            lime: 575\n            salt: 1 // 1 = 1\n\n        T_total = min(20000, 575, 1) = 1\n\n        Per friend: 1 // 10 = 0\n\n        Output: 0.\n\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        Read the 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\n        total_drink = k * l\n        total_slices = c * d\n\n        # For drink: each toast (for one friend) uses nl ml -> total toasts (across friends) is total_drink // nl\n        # For lime: each toast (for one friend) uses 1 slice -> total toasts is total_slices\n        # For salt: each toast (for one friend) uses np grams -> total toasts is p // np\n\n        total_toasts = min(total_drink // nl, total_slices, p // np)\n\n        # But note: the total_toasts must be an integer and we are using floor division. However, the problem requires that the toasts are whole.\n\n        # Then each friend can make total_toasts // n toasts.\n\n        However, wait: the constraints for drink and salt are not just the total_slices but also the other resources. \n\n        But note: the drink constraint is defined as total_drink // nl (because each toast uses nl ml, so we can have at most total_drink//nl toasts for one friend? Actually, no: we are counting the total toasts (across all friends). \n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            total_toasts (across all friends) must satisfy:\n                total_toasts <= total_drink // nl   [because each toast uses nl ml and we have total_drink ml, and we are counting each toast individually (regardless of which friend)]\n\n            Similarly, total_toasts <= total_slices   [each toast requires one slice]\n\n            And total_toasts <= p // np\n\n        Then we divide by n to get the number per friend.\n\n        But note: the drink constraint: total_drink // nl gives the maximum number of toasts (each toast being one friend having one) that the drink can support.\n\n        However, we must ensure that we are not exceeding the drink for the entire set of toasts. Since each toast (any friend) uses nl ml, the total toasts is indeed limited by total_drink // nl.\n\n        But wait, the drink is used by all toasts (each toast, regardless of which friend, uses nl ml). Similarly for salt.\n\n        So the method is:\n\n            total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )\n\n            ans = total_toasts // n   ??? \n\n        But wait, is that correct? \n\n        Example: n=3, k=4, l=5, ... -> total_toasts=6, then 6//3=2.\n\n        However, consider: what if we have 6 toasts in total (across 3 friends) and we want to distribute them equally. Then each friend gets 2 toasts. \n\n        But note: the condition for drink: total_drink = 20, and we have 6 toasts * 3 ml/toast = 18 ml, which is <=20. \n\n        However, the calculation for the drink constraint was 20//3=6 (floor division). But 6*3=18 <=20, so that's okay.\n\n        But what if we have 7 toasts? Then drink would require 21 ml, which is more than 20, so 7 is not allowed. So the constraint is correctly given by floor division.\n\n        However, note: the drink constraint is actually: the total toasts (each toast being one friend) cannot exceed total_drink // nl. \n\n        Similarly, the lime constraint: each toast requires one slice, so we can have at most c*d toasts.\n\n        And the salt constraint: total toasts cannot exceed p // np.\n\n        Then the total toasts is the minimum of these three.\n\n        Then we divide by n to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\n        But wait: is that always correct? \n\n        Example: n=3, total_toasts=6, then 6//3=2.\n\n        However, consider: what if the total_toasts is not divisible by n? Then we take the floor. \n\n        Example: n=3, total_toasts=7 -> then 7//3=2. But wait, we have 7 toasts in total. We want to distribute equally. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\n        So we cannot have different numbers. We must have the same number for each. \n\n        Therefore, we can have at most floor(total_toasts / n) toasts per friend, because:\n\n            If each friend makes t toasts, then the total toasts is t * n.\n\n            We require t * n <= total_toasts (from the resource constraints).\n\n            Therefore, the maximum t is floor(total_toasts / n) ?\n\n        But wait, our total_toasts already is the maximum total toasts (across friends) we can have (from the resources). \n\n        Then the condition for the distribution is: t * n <= total_toasts.\n\n        So t_max = total_toasts // n   (using integer floor division) is the maximum t such that t*n <= total_toasts.\n\n        However, note: we calculated total_toasts as the minimum of the three constraints. Then we are distributing the total_toasts as equally as possible? \n\n        But the problem is: we are limited by the total_toasts (the overall total) and then we require that the total toasts is exactly n * t. \n\n        However, we don't require that the total_toasts is exactly n*t, we require that we don't exceed the resources. \n\n        Actually, we can only use up to total_toasts toasts (across friends). And we must assign t toasts to each friend, so the total toasts we use is n*t. \n\n        Therefore, we must have n*t <= total_toasts.\n\n        The maximum t is then floor(total_toasts / n) because:\n\n            t = total_toasts // n   (since we cannot use fractional toasts, and we cannot exceed the total_toasts).\n\n        But note: the example calculation did: min(6,80,100) / 3 = 2, and then took the integer part? Actually, they wrote: 6/3=2, which is integer. \n\n        However, the problem says: print a single integer.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )\n            ans = total_toasts // n\n\n        But wait: is that the same as:\n\n            drink_limit = (k*l) // nl\n            lime_limit = c*d\n            salt_limit = p // np\n\n            total_toasts = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n\n            ans = total_toasts // n\n\n        However, note: the drink constraint is (k*l) // nl, which is the maximum total toasts (across friends) from the drink.\n\n        But wait, the drink constraint should be: the total toasts (each toast being one friend) is limited by (k*l) // nl? \n\n        Yes, because each toast uses nl ml. \n\n        Similarly, lime: each toast uses one slice -> total toasts is limited by c*d.\n\n        Salt: each toast uses np grams -> total toasts is limited by p // np.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            n = int(data[0]); k = int(data[1]); l = int(data[2]); c = int(data[3]); d = int(data[4]); p = int(data[5]); nl = int(data[6]); np = int(data[7])\n\n            total_drink_ml = k * l\n            total_slices = c * d\n\n            # Constraints for total toasts (across all friends) in terms of individual toasts (each friend's toast counts separately)\n            drink_limit = total_drink_ml // nl\n            lime_limit = total_slices\n            salt_limit = p // np\n\n            total_toasts = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n\n            # Now, we can only use total_toasts toasts in total (across friends). To distribute equally, each friend gets total_toasts // n toasts.\n            ans = total_toasts // n\n\n        But wait: is the drink constraint correctly computed as total_drink_ml // nl?\n\n        Example: n=3, k=4, l=5, nl=3 -> drink_limit = 20//3 = 6. That's correct.\n\n        However, note: the drink constraint is defined per toast (each toast uses nl ml) and the total toasts is the sum over friends. \n\n        But note: the drink is used by each toast (each friend's toast) independently. So yes, the drink constraint is total_drink_ml // nl.\n\n        However, there is a nuance: the drink is shared by all. But since each toast (whether by any friend) uses nl ml, the total amount of drink used is (number of toasts) * nl. And we have total_drink_ml ml. \n\n        So the maximum number of toasts (across friends) is indeed total_drink_ml // nl.\n\n        Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n        Let me test with the examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n            n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n\n            total_drink_ml = 20\n            drink_limit = 20 // 3 = 6\n            lime_limit = 80\n            salt_limit = 100 // 1 = 100\n            total_toasts = 6\n            ans = 6 // 3 = 2\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\n            n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n            total_drink_ml = 1000\n            drink_limit = 1000 // 4 = 250\n            lime_limit = 1*19 = 19\n            salt_limit = 90 // 3 = 30\n            total_toasts = 19\n            ans = 19 // 5 = 3\n\n        Example 3:\n            Input: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n            total_drink_ml = 1000000\n            drink_limit = 1000000 // 50 = 20000\n            lime_limit = 25*23 = 575\n            salt_limit = 1 // 1 = 1\n            total_toasts = 1\n            ans = 1 // 10 = 0\n\n        However, wait: the example input third example is: \n            Input: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n\n        And expected output: 0.\n\n        But wait: the salt constraint: p=1, np=1 -> salt_limit = 1 // 1 = 1, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the drink and lime are not the limiting factors. But the salt is: only 1 toast can be made in total (across all friends). Then each friend gets 1//10 = 0.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But wait, is the drink constraint correctly computed? \n\n        In the third example, the drink is 1000000 ml, and nl=50, so drink_limit = 20000. Lime is 575. So the limiting factor is salt (1). \n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the input integers are positive and between 1 and 1000.\n\n        We assume integer division (floor) is the way to go.\n\n        One more edge: what if the drink_limit, lime_limit, or salt_limit is zero? \n\n        Example: if nl is very large so that (k*l) // nl == 0, then total_toasts = 0, and then 0//n = 0.\n\n        Example: n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=2, np=1.\n\n            total_drink_ml = 1\n            drink_limit = 1 // 2 = 0\n            lime_limit = 1\n            salt_limit = 1\n            total_toasts = 0\n            ans = 0 // 1 = 0.\n\n        This is correct: because we need 2 ml for one toast (for one friend) but we only have 1 ml.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            k = int(data[1])\n            l = int(data[2])\n            c = int(data[3])\n            d = int(data[4])\n            p = int(data[5])\n            nl = int(data[6])\n            np = int(data[7])\n\n            total_drink = k * l\n            drink_limit = total_drink // nl   # total toasts (across friends) from drink\n\n            total_slices = c * d\n            # lime_limit = total_slices   (each toast requires one slice)\n\n            salt_limit = p // np\n\n            total_toasts = min(drink_limit, total_slices, salt_limit)\n\n            ans = total_toasts // n\n\n        Print ans.\n\n        But wait, there's a catch: the lime constraint is total_slices, but note that the problem says each toast requires one slice. So yes, we can have at most total_slices toasts (each toast being one friend). \n\n        However, what if the drink and salt are not the issue, but the lime is? \n\n        Example: n=3, k=10, l=5, c=1, d=1, p=100, nl=1, np=1.\n\n            total_drink = 50, drink_limit = 50 // 1 = 50\n            total_slices = 1\n            salt_limit = 100 // 1 = 100\n            total_toasts = 1\n            ans = 1 // 3 = 0.\n\n        But wait, we have 3 friends. Each toast requires one slice. We have only 1 slice. So we can have at most 1 toast. But then how to distribute 1 toast among 3 friends? \n\n        The problem says: \"each friend needs ... for one toast\". So if a friend is to make a toast, they need a slice. But we only have 1 slice. \n\n        We can only serve one friend one toast, but the others cannot have a toast (because they don't have a slice). \n\n        The problem requires that they all drink the same amount. So we cannot have one friend having 1 toast and the others 0.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum number of toasts per friend is 0.\n\n        Our code returns 0, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the total_toasts is 1, and then we do 1//3=0.\n\n        This is consistent.\n\n        But wait, what if we have 3 slices? Then:\n\n            total_slices = 3, drink_limit=50, salt_limit=100, total_toasts=3, ans=3//3=1.\n\n        Then each friend gets 1 toast. The total toasts is 3, which is 1 per friend. \n\n        So the code works.\n\n        However, note: the drink and salt constraints are also considered per toast (each toast uses nl and np). \n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, l=3, c=3, d=1, p=3, nl=2, np=1.\n\n            total_drink = 6\n            drink_limit = 6//2 = 3\n            total_slices = 3\n            salt_limit = 3//1 = 3\n            total_toasts = 3\n            ans = 3//3 = 1.\n\n        Check: each friend needs 2 ml and 1 gram of salt per toast. \n            For 1 toast per friend: total ml = 3*2=6, total slices=3, total salt=3*1=3. -> fits.\n\n        Example: n=3, k=2, l=3, c=3, d=1, p=2, nl=2, np=1.\n\n            total_drink = 6, drink_limit=3\n            total_slices=3\n            salt_limit=2//1=2\n            total_toasts=2\n            ans=2//3=0.\n\n        Why 0? Because we cannot give each friend the same number of toasts: \n            If we try to give 0 toasts, then we use 0 resources.\n            If we try to give 1 toast per friend, we need 3 ml (from drink) and 3 slices and 3 grams of salt. \n            But we have only 2 grams of salt. So we cannot even make one toast for the entire group? \n\n        Actually, wait: one toast for the entire group (each friend one toast) requires 3*2=6 ml (which we have), 3 slices (which we have), and 3*1=3 grams of salt (but we only have 2). \n\n        But note: the problem does not require that the entire group toasts simultaneously. However, the condition is that each friend drinks the same number of toasts. \n\n        We cannot break a toast: we either give a friend a toast or not. \n\n        The total toasts we can have is 2 (from salt). Then we must distribute 2 toasts among 3 friends equally. \n\n        How? We can give 0 to some and 1 to others, but that breaks the condition. \n\n        Therefore, the maximum t such that t*n <= total_toasts (which is 2) is t=0.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the total_toasts is the maximum total toasts (across friends) we can have (from the resources). Then we can only use up to total_toasts toasts. \n\n        And we must assign t toasts to each friend, so the total toasts we use is t * n. \n\n        Therefore, the condition is: t * n <= total_toasts.\n\n        The maximum t is floor(total_toasts / n) ? \n\n        Actually, no: we are not forced to use the entire total_toasts. We can use fewer. But we want to maximize t. \n\n        The maximum t is the maximum integer such that t * n <= total_toasts.\n\n        Which is: t = total_toasts // n   (because if total_toasts is 2 and n=3, then 2//3=0).\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        Write the code accordingly.\n\n        Note: The problem says the integers are positive and not less than 1, so we don't have to worry about division by zero.\n\n        Code:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            n = int(data[0])\n            k = int(data[1])\n            l = int(data[2])\n            c = int(data[3])\n            d = int(data[4])\n            p = int(data[5])\n            nl = int(data[6])\n            np = int(data[7])\n\n            total_drink = k * l\n            drink_limit = total_drink // nl\n\n            total_slices = c * d\n            # lime_limit is total_slices (because each toast requires one slice)\n\n            salt_limit = p // np\n\n            total_toasts = min(drink_limit, total_slices, salt_limit)\n\n            ans = total_toasts // n\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'] -> 2\n        Example 2: ['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'] -> 3\n        Example 3: ['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'] -> 0\n\n        It matches.\n\n        However, wait: the example input is given as a list of strings? Actually, the problem says the input is one line with 8 integers.\n\n        We are reading one line and splitting.\n\n        But the example input is provided as:\n\n            ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n        This is just for illustration. In the actual competition, we read from stdin.\n\n        We'll write the code as above.\n\n        One more note: the problem says the numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n        We are using split(), which handles that.\n\n        Let me submit the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the constraints imposed by the drink, lime slices, and salt, then find the limiting factor that allows all friends to have the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The solution involves:\n   - Calculating the total available drink, lime slices, and salt.\n   - Determining the maximum number of toasts possible across all friends using each resource.\n   - The limiting factor is the smallest of these three values.\n   - Dividing the total toasts by the number of friends to ensure each friend gets an equal number of toasts.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution hinges on understanding that each toast consumes a fixed amount of resources per friend. The total resources must be sufficient to support the same number of toasts for each friend. The limiting resource dictates the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves straightforward arithmetic operations:\n   - Multiply the number of bottles by the volume per bottle to get the total drink.\n   - Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime to get the total lime slices.\n   - Use integer division to determine the maximum toasts possible from each resource.\n   - The smallest of these three values is the total toasts possible.\n   - Divide this total by the number of friends (using integer division) to get the number of toasts per friend.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves basic arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n\n    total_drink = k * l\n    drink_limit = total_drink // nl\n\n    total_slices = c * d\n\n    salt_limit = p // np\n\n    total_toasts = min(drink_limit, total_slices, salt_limit)\n\n    ans = total_toasts // n\n\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, volume per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, drink per toast per friend, and salt per toast per friend, respectively.\n2. **Calculating Total Resources**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Multiplied the number of bottles by the volume per bottle.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Multiplied the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n3. **Determining Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: Total drink divided by the drink required per toast per friend.\n   - **Salt Limit**: Total salt divided by the salt required per toast per friend.\n4. **Finding the Limiting Factor**: The smallest value among the drink limit, lime slices, and salt limit determines the maximum number of toasts possible across all friends.\n5. **Calculating Toasts Per Friend**: The total toasts are divided by the number of friends (using integer division) to ensure each friend gets an equal number of toasts.\n6. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the number of toasts each friend can make. \n\nThis approach efficiently leverages basic arithmetic and comparison operations to solve the problem within the given constraints.",
