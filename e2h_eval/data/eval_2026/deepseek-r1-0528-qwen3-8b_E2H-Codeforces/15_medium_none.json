They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We have a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. The tournament proceeds in phases (from phase 1 to phase n) until one champion remains.\n In each phase i (0-indexed? note: the string s has n characters, and the i-th character corresponds to the (n-i)-th phase? Actually, the problem says:\n   \"the i-th phase\" (with 2^(n-i) games) is denoted by s_i.\n\n However, note: the problem states that the first phase has 2^(n-1) games, then the next phase (if needed) has 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n But note: the string s is given of length n, and the i-th character (0-indexed) corresponds to the (i+1)-th phase? Actually, the problem says:\n\n   \"if s_i is equal to 0, then during the i-th phase ...\", meaning the first character of s corresponds to the first phase (which has 2^(n-1) games).\n\n So we have:\n   Phase 0: 2^(n-1) games -> s[0] (first character)\n   Phase 1: 2^(n-2) games -> s[1]\n   ...\n   Phase n-1: 2^0 = 1 game -> s[n-1]\n\n Each team has a skill level which is a permutation of [1, 2, ..., 2^n].\n\n The outcome of a match in a phase depends on s[i]:\n   If s[i] is '0', then the lower skill wins.\n   If s[i] is '1', then the higher skill wins.\n\n We are to find all integers x (which represent a team's skill) such that there exists a permutation p (i.e., an assignment of the numbers 1 to 2^n to the teams) \n for which the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\n Observation: The tournament structure is fixed (single elimination bracket). The matches are predetermined: the initial bracket is fixed (team 1 vs team 2, then winner vs winner of team3 vs team4, etc.).\n\n However, note: the problem does not assign the teams arbitrarily by their original index? Actually, the initial bracket is fixed by the order: \n   First round: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), ... (then the winners are re-bracketed for the next round).\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 plays against team 4, and so on\". \n\n However, the catch: the permutation p assigns the skill levels arbitrarily to the initial teams. So we can assign any skill to any initial team.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: given the bracket and the outcomes (determined by s) for each round, is there an assignment of the numbers 1 to 2^n to the leaves of the bracket such that the team with number x wins?\n\n Alternatively, we can think: we are free to assign the skills arbitrarily to the initial teams, so we can choose which teams (initial positions) get which skills.\n\n How does the tournament proceed?\n\n We have a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves (each leaf is an initial team). The rounds correspond to the levels of the tree (from the leaves up).\n\n In each round (phase), the outcome of a match between two teams (with skills a and b) is determined by the current round's result (s[i]):\n\n   If the round is '1' (top-level round 0): then the higher skill wins.\n   If the round is '0': then the lower skill wins.\n\n But note: the rounds are played from the bottom up. The first round (round0) is the first phase (with 2^(n-1) games). Then the second round (round1) is the next phase (if needed) with 2^(n-2) games, etc.\n\n The key is: the outcome of the entire tournament is determined by the fixed bracket and the outcomes of the rounds. Since we can assign the skills arbitrarily, we are effectively asking: for which x (from 1 to 2^n) can we assign the skills so that the team with skill x wins?\n\n Alternate approach: we can simulate the tournament backwards.\n\n Let the final winner be x. Then, for each round from the last to the first, we can determine the set of teams that must have advanced to the next round to allow x to win.\n\n However, note that the outcome function in each round is either min or max (depending on s[i]). \n\n We can use a recursive (or iterative) method that, given a set of teams (in a particular round) and the remaining rounds (with their outcomes specified), checks if it's possible for x to be in that set and then propagate backwards.\n\n But note: the tournament bracket is fixed (the initial pairing and subsequent pairings). The bracket structure is known (like a standard single elimination bracket).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We know the total number of teams: total = 2**n.\n\n 2. The bracket: the first round matches are (0,1), (2,3), (4,5), ... (each node in the bracket is represented by an index, but note: the initial teams are labeled 0 to 2**n-1).\n\n 3. We are free to assign the skills arbitrarily. So we can decide the skill of each initial team.\n\n 4. The condition for a match in a given round (say round i, which is the (n-i)-th phase from the top) is:\n\n      if s[n-1-i] == '1': then the winner is the maximum of the two skills.\n      if s[n-1-i] == '0': then the winner is the minimum.\n\n    But note: the problem indexes the string s from the first phase (largest number of games) as the first character. So the first round (i=0) uses s[0], the second round (i=1) uses s[1], etc.\n\n    However, when we simulate backwards, we start from the final round (the last character in s, which is the last phase) and go backwards to the first.\n\n 5. How to check for a particular x?\n\n    We can consider: for x to win, in the final (last round) the two teams that meet must be such that the outcome (given by the last character of s) leads to x winning. Then, we need to ensure that in the previous rounds, the necessary conditions hold.\n\n    But note: we can assign the skills arbitrarily to the initial teams. So the condition is: we must assign the skills so that the entire path from the initial bracket to the final is consistent.\n\n    We can use a divide and conquer method (or a simulation of the tournament) that for a given x, we try to assign the skills in such a way that x wins.\n\n    However, note: the total number of teams is 2^n (which is up to 2^18 = 262144) and we cannot iterate over all permutations.\n\n Another idea: we can use the fact that the bracket is fixed and the outcome functions are deterministic (min or max) to determine the necessary conditions for x to win.\n\n Observation: In each match, the outcome is determined by the two skills. The entire tournament can be seen as imposing constraints on the relative ordering of the skills.\n\n Specifically, we can think of the tournament as imposing a set of inequalities (or equivalences) that must hold for x to be the winner.\n\n However, the outcome in each round is defined by the current s[i]. So:\n\n   In round 0 (first round): for a match between two groups (each group being a set of teams that will meet in that round), the winner is determined by comparing two values (the two that meet) and taking min or max.\n\n But note: the bracket is fixed and the matches are predetermined. So the entire tournament defines a sequence of comparisons.\n\n We can use a recursive function that, given a set of teams (represented by their initial indices) that are still in the tournament at a certain round, and the remaining rounds (from the current round index to the final round), and a particular value x, determines whether we can assign skills to the teams such that x wins and the outcomes of the rounds are as given.\n\n However, the state space might be too large.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a known technique for such bracket problems: the tournament bracket forces a set of conditions on the ordering of the skills. In particular, the winner must be the maximum or minimum in the entire bracket in some rounds? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, we can consider the following:\n\n   Let F(round, set_of_teams) be the condition that the set_of_teams (the teams that are still in the tournament at the beginning of this round) can be assigned skills such that the winner of the entire tournament (from this round onward) is x.\n\n   But note: we are only concerned with x being the overall winner.\n\n   However, we are free to assign the skills arbitrarily to the initial teams. So we can assign any distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n.\n\n   We can also note: the tournament structure is fixed and the outcomes are fixed by s. Therefore, the set of teams that can be the winner is constrained by the bracket and the outcomes.\n\n   We can use a two-step method:\n\n     Step 1: For each round, we know the outcome function (min or max). This means that for two teams a and b meeting in round i (which is the (n-1-i)-th character of s, counting from the last round), the winner is:\n\n          if s[i] == '1': max(a, b)\n          if s[i] == '0': min(a, b)\n\n     Step 2: We want to know: is there an assignment of distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n to the initial teams such that x wins the tournament.\n\n   We can try to build the tournament from the bottom up.\n\n   Let the leaves (initial teams) be numbered 0 to (2**n - 1). We can represent the tournament as a complete binary tree with 2^n leaves.\n\n   Then, for each internal node (match), we know the outcome function.\n\n   We can define:\n\n        Let A be the set of teams (leaves) that must be assigned numbers <= some value, and B the ones that must be >=, etc.\n\n   However, we can use the following idea:\n\n        We know the entire path that x must take. In each round, x must be the winner of its subtree.\n\n        Consider: x must be present in the initial set. Then, in the first round, x must be in a match. The outcome of that match (and subsequent matches) must lead to x advancing.\n\n        But note: we can assign the other teams arbitrarily. So the problem is: can we assign the other teams such that x wins?\n\n        Conditions:\n\n          In the match that x participates in at the first round, the opponent must be chosen appropriately.\n\n        Actually, we can think: the entire tournament imposes a set of necessary conditions on x.\n\n        Let the rounds be from 0 to n-1 (0 being the first round, n-1 being the last round).\n\n        In round k (0-indexed from the first round) we have 2^(n-1-k) matches.\n\n        We can consider the entire bracket as having a fixed structure. The key is that the winner of a match is determined by the two numbers in that match and the outcome function of that round.\n\n        We can use a greedy assignment: we want to assign the smallest possible numbers to the teams that are beaten by x, and the largest to the ones that beat x? But note: sometimes we have multiple rounds.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a known technique: the tournament bracket can be traversed and we can determine the constraints on the rank of x.\n\n        Consider: the tournament is a complete binary tree. Each match in round k (counting from the bottom, so round0 is the first round) is between two subtrees of size 2^k.\n\n        We can compute the minimal and maximal value that x must have to win the tournament, given the outcome functions.\n\n        However, note: the outcome function in each round is either min or max. This is similar to a sorting network.\n\n        There is a known approach for problems like \"Determine if a given element can be the winner in a tournament with given comparison outcomes\" by simulating the tournament from the bottom up and assigning the necessary conditions.\n\n        Steps for a particular x:\n\n          We can consider that the entire tournament is a set of comparisons. We can represent the tournament as a set of constraints that x must satisfy.\n\n          Let the rounds be from the last (final) round to the first.\n\n          In the final round (round n-1, which is the last character of s), the two teams that meet must be such that the outcome (given by s[-1]) is x. So:\n\n            if s[-1] == '1': then x must be the maximum of the two teams in that final match.\n            if s[-1] == '0': then x must be the minimum of the two teams in that final match.\n\n          Now, what are the two teams in the final match? They are the winners of two semi-finals (which are the two halves of the bracket). In the semi-final, the outcome is given by s[-2] (the second last character). \n\n          But note: the bracket is fixed. The two teams that meet in the final are the winners of the left half and the right half of the bracket.\n\n          Therefore, we can recursively determine the constraints on x for the entire bracket.\n\n        Algorithm for a fixed x:\n\n          We can represent the bracket as a binary tree. The root is the champion. We know the path from the root (x) to the leaves.\n\n          However, we can also use a BFS from the root (champion) down to the leaves, and at each node we know the condition (whether the winner must be the max or min of its two children).\n\n          But note: the rounds are from the bottom (first round) to the top (last round). The condition for a node at depth d (with d=0 being the root) is given by the character at index (n-1-d) in the string s.\n\n          Actually, the rounds are:\n\n            Round0 (first round) -> depth n-1 (if we consider the root at depth0, then the leaves are at depth n)\n            Round1 -> depth n-2\n            ...\n            Round n-1 -> depth 0 (root)\n\n          Alternatively, we can label the rounds from the root: the root is the last round (n-1), and the leaves are round0.\n\n          But the problem gives s[0] for the first round (which is the deepest, round0). So:\n\n            s[0] -> round0 (the first round, which is the deepest, so the matches are at depth n-1 in a tree of depth n)\n            s[1] -> round1 (the next round, which is at depth n-2)\n            ...\n            s[n-1] -> round n-1 (the final round, depth0)\n\n          Now, the condition for a node at round i (which is depth = n-1-i) is:\n\n            if s[i] == '1': then the winner is the max of the two children.\n            if s[i] == '0': then the winner is the min.\n\n          Now, if we fix x as the root (champion), then:\n\n            In the left child of the root (which is the winner of the left half of the bracket), the value must be <= x (if s[-1]=='1') OR >= x (if s[-1]=='0')?\n\n          Actually, no: because the root is the winner, and the root's match (last round) is against the other child. The condition is:\n\n            if s[-1] == '1': then x must be greater than or equal to the other child's value. But note: we don't know the other child's value, but we know that x must be the maximum.\n\n            Similarly, if s[-1]=='0', then x must be the minimum, so the other child must be >= x.\n\n          Then, we look at the left and right subtrees (each of which is a bracket of 2^(n-1) teams). The left subtree must produce a value that is <= x (if s[-1]=='1') or >= x (if s[-1]=='0').\n\n          And then we require that in the left subtree, the value produced (call it L) satisfies:\n\n            if s[-1]=='1': L <= x\n            if s[-1]=='0': L >= x\n\n          Then, in the left subtree, the conditions from the subsequent rounds (which are the rounds from 0 to n-2) must hold.\n\n          How to compute the range of values that the left subtree must produce?\n\n          We can do a DFS/BFS from the root downward, propagating the constraints.\n\n          At each node (which represents a match in a particular round i, i.e., at depth n-1-i), we know the outcome function (from s[i]). Then, we know that the value that passes through this node must be:\n\n            if the node is the left child of a parent that used s[i] (where i is the round index for that parent's round):\n\n              But note: the parent's round index is i, and the parent's outcome is s[i]. The parent requires that the winner is the max (if s[i]=='1') or min (if s[i]=='0') of the two children.\n\n              Therefore, the constraint for the left child (and similarly the right child) is:\n\n                For the parent node: \n                  If s[i]=='1' (max), then the parent's value = max(left_value, right_value). Then, the parent's value is at least as large as both children.\n\n                  Then, for the left child: the parent's value >= left_value, and similarly for the right child.\n\n                However, we are going from the root to the leaves (from champion to the initial teams). We are determining the constraints on the left subtree.\n\n          Actually, we can traverse the tree from the root down to the leaves, and at each node we record:\n\n            low: the minimum value that can be assigned to the winner of the subtree rooted at this node, given the constraints from above and below.\n            high: the maximum value that can be assigned to the winner of the subtree.\n\n          But note: we are free to assign the entire set of numbers arbitrarily. However, the entire tournament uses distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            We know that the entire set of numbers is fixed (from 1 to 2^n). We are going to assign distinct numbers.\n\n          However, we are only concerned with x being the champion. We can consider the constraints that the tournament imposes on x and the other numbers.\n\n          We can use a recursive function that, given a node and the constraint (whether the value at this node must be <= some bound or >= some bound) and the available numbers, returns whether it is possible to assign numbers to the leaves so that the tournament outcome is x.\n\n          But note: the numbers must be distinct and cover 1 to 2^n.\n\n        Another known idea: we can use the concept of \"must be greater than\" and \"must be less than\" from the bracket.\n\n        Consider: the entire tournament can be viewed as imposing a partial order on the numbers. The champion must be the maximum or minimum in each match as specified.\n\n        We can compute the minimal set of numbers that must be less than x and the maximal set of numbers that must be greater than x.\n\n        However, note: the bracket is fixed and the outcome functions are fixed.\n\n        Steps for a fixed x:\n\n          We can simulate the tournament from the leaves to the root, and at each match we know the condition.\n\n          Let the initial teams (leaves) be assigned numbers arbitrarily. We are going to assign numbers to the leaves.\n\n          The root must be x.\n\n          Then, for each match (node) we know:\n\n            if the node's outcome is '1' (max), then the two children must be <= the node's value (if we are going from leaves to root, then the node's value is the max, so the children are <= node's value).\n            if the node's outcome is '0' (min), then the two children must be >= the node's value.\n\n          But wait: the root is x. Then, for the two children of the root (the two halves of the bracket), we have:\n\n            if s[-1]=='1' (max): then the root is the max, so both children must be <= x.\n            if s[-1]=='0' (min): then the root is the min, so both children must be >= x.\n\n          Then, we require that the entire left subtree (of size 2^(n-1)) produces a value <= x (if s[-1]=='1') or >= x (if s[-1]=='0').\n\n          Then, for the left subtree, we have the same procedure: the root of the left subtree (which is the winner of the left half) must be <= x (if s[-1]=='1') or >= x (if s[-1]=='0'), and then the outcome of the matches in the left subtree (given by the next character in s) will impose further constraints.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let F(node, min_val, max_val) be a function that returns whether we can assign numbers to the leaves of the subtree rooted at 'node' such that the winner of that subtree is in [min_val, max_val] (if the node is a match node) or exactly the value (if the node is a leaf?).\n\n          Actually, we are building from the root (which is fixed to x) down to the leaves. But we don't know the entire assignment, we only care about x being the champion.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We know the entire bracket. The root is fixed to x. Then, we know the constraints on the children of the root.\n\n            Then, we know the constraints on the children of those children, etc.\n\n          We can do a DFS from the root, and at each match node (non-leaf) we know the outcome function (from s). Then, we can set:\n\n            If the node's outcome is '1' (max): then the winner must be the maximum of the two subtrees. Therefore, the winner must be at least as large as the two children's winners. But we already set the winner (at the parent) to x. Then, the two children must be <= x.\n\n            Similarly, if the node's outcome is '0' (min): then the two children must be >= x.\n\n          Then, we require that the two children's subtrees (each of size 2^(k) for k decreasing) can produce a winner that is <= x (if outcome is '1') or >= x (if outcome is '0').\n\n          Then, we can recursively check the two children's subtrees.\n\n          The base case: when we reach a leaf (a team), then we assign a number. But note: the leaf must be assigned a distinct number from the entire set.\n\n          However, we are free to assign arbitrarily. So the constraints on the leaves are that they must be distinct and from 1 to 2^n.\n\n          But note: we are checking for a fixed x. We are going to assign x to one of the leaves (the one that ends up at the root). Then, we assign the rest arbitrarily, but satisfying the constraints.\n\n          We can think: the entire set of numbers is fixed. The constraints are:\n\n            For a match node with outcome '1' (max): the two children's winners must be <= the parent's value (which is x for the root, but for intermediate nodes we don't fix the value, we just know the constraint direction).\n\n          Actually, we don't fix the value at intermediate nodes, we only know the constraint direction (<= or >=) from the parent.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let the entire bracket be represented as a binary tree with 2^n leaves.\n\n            We know the outcome function for each internal node (from s, indexed by the round: the root is the last round, then the next level is the second last, etc.)\n\n            We want to know: is there an assignment of distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n to the leaves such that:\n\n              - The root (champion) is x.\n              - For each match (internal node) at depth d (which is round index = n-1-d) with outcome s_d (but note: our s index: the first round (deepest) is s[0], so the root is at depth0, which corresponds to s[n-1]?).\n\n            Actually, we have to map the rounds to the depth:\n\n              The root (depth0) corresponds to the last round (n-1) -> s[n-1]\n              The next level (depth1) corresponds to the second last round (n-2) -> s[n-2]\n              ...\n              The leaves (depth n) correspond to round0 -> s[0] is not used at the leaves.\n\n          How to traverse:\n\n            We'll do a DFS from the root (which is fixed to x) and then for each child, we know the constraint:\n\n              If the current node (at depth d) has outcome s_d (where d is the round index: the root is round n-1, so we use s[n-1-d]), then:\n\n                 if s_d == '1' (max): then the parent's value is the max of the two children. But note: the parent's value is already fixed to x (if we are at the root) or we are propagating constraints.\n\n            Actually, we are going from the root down, so we know the constraint that the child must satisfy relative to the parent's value (which is x for the root, but for children we don't know the exact value, but we know the parent's constraint).\n\n          Let me redefine the rounds: \n\n            We have n rounds (from round0 to round n-1). The root is the last round (round n-1). The two children of the root are the winners of two subtrees of size 2^(n-1). The outcome for the root is s[n-1] (the last character).\n\n          Then, for the root:\n\n            if s[n-1]=='1': then x must be the max of the two children's values, so both children's values must be <= x.\n            if s[n-1]=='0': then x must be the min, so both children's values must be >= x.\n\n          Then, for the two children (each is the root of a subtree of 2^(n-1) teams), we require that:\n\n            For the left child: we must assign numbers to its subtree such that the winner is <= x (if s[n-1]=='1') or >= x (if s[n-1]=='0').\n\n          Then, we move to the left child's subtree. The left child's outcome (if it is an internal node) is given by s[n-2] (because the next round is the second last). \n\n          Now, the left child's value (the winner of the left half) is not fixed, but we have a constraint (<=x or >=x). Then, for the left child's match (if it is a match node, i.e., not a leaf) we use s[n-2] to impose constraints on its children.\n\n          However, note: the entire set of numbers must be distinct and cover 1 to 2^n.\n\n          The challenge: we have to assign distinct numbers to the leaves. The constraints are:\n\n            In the root's subtree (left half) we must assign 2^(n-1) distinct numbers (from 1 to 2^n) that are all <= x (if root outcome is '1') or all >= x (if root outcome is '0').\n\n          Then, the root's other child (right half) gets the remaining numbers.\n\n          But wait: the root's two children are the winners of two independent brackets. The numbers in the left bracket and the right bracket are disjoint.\n\n          So, the entire set is partitioned into two sets of size 2^(n-1) for the two halves.\n\n          Then, the left half must contain a set of 2^(n-1) numbers that are <= x (if root outcome is '1') or >= x (if root outcome is '0').\n\n          Then, the condition for the left half is:\n\n            The set of numbers in the left half must be a subset of [1, x] (if root outcome is '1') or [x, 2^n] (if root outcome is '0').\n\n          But note: the left half must be able to produce a winner that is the maximum (if the left half's root outcome is '1') or minimum (if '0') of its own set, and then that winner must be <= x (if root outcome is '1') or >= x (if root outcome is '0').\n\n          This is getting complicated.\n\n        Known solution approach (from competitive programming): \n\n          We can use a recursive function that, given a node and a set of constraints (min and max bounds) and the available numbers, but the state space is too large.\n\n        Another idea: we can use the fact that the tournament bracket is fixed and the outcome is fixed. Then, the necessary and sufficient condition for x to be the winner is that:\n\n          There exists a way to assign the numbers 1 to 2^n to the leaves such that:\n\n            For each match (from the root down), the outcome (min or max) holds.\n\n          And we are free to assign arbitrarily. Therefore, we can consider the following:\n\n          Let the entire set of numbers be {1, 2, ..., 2^n}. We fix x to be the champion.\n\n          Then, the two halves of the bracket (left and right) must be assigned disjoint sets of 2^(n-1) numbers.\n\n          The condition for the root: \n\n            if s[n-1]=='1': then the left half must be assigned numbers <= x and the right half numbers >= x? Actually, no: the root is x, and the left half's winner must be <= x and the right half's winner must be <= x? But wait, the root is the max, so the two children must be <= x.\n\n          However, the two children are the winners of their halves. The entire left half must be assigned numbers <= x, and the entire right half must be assigned numbers <= x? \n\n          But note: the left half and right half are independent, but the numbers must be distinct. And the root is x. Then, the numbers in the left half must be from [1, x-1] and the right half from [1, x-1] as well? That is impossible because we only have 2^(n-1) numbers in each half, and [1, x-1] has only x-1 numbers, which might be less than 2^(n-1).\n\n          Therefore, we must reinterpret:\n\n          The root is x. Then, the two children's winners must be <= x (if root outcome is '1'). But note: the two children's winners are the maximum (if the child's outcome is '1') or minimum (if '0') of their half.\n\n          Actually, the condition at the root is only that x is the max of the two children. So the two children's values must be <= x. But the two children's values are the winners of their halves.\n\n          Then, the entire left half must be such that its winner is <= x. Similarly for the right half.\n\n          Now, what is the condition for the left half to have a winner <= x?\n\n            The left half's tournament (which is a bracket of 2^(n-1) teams) must produce a winner <= x.\n\n          And similarly, the right half's tournament must produce a winner <= x.\n\n          Then, the entire set of numbers for the left half and the right half must be from [1, x] (excluding x, because x is the root). But wait, x is already used (as the root). Therefore, the available numbers are [1, 2^n] without x.\n\n          Then, the left half must be assigned 2^(n-1) numbers from [1, x] excluding x, and the right half the rest.\n\n          But note: the root's two children are the winners of the halves. The condition is that both winners are <= x. \n\n          However, the left half must be assigned a set S1 of 2^(n-1) numbers, and the right half S2, and S1 ∪ S2 = {1,2,...,2^n} \\ {x}.\n\n          Then, the condition for the left half is: the maximum number in S1 must be <= x? No, because the outcome in the left half's matches might be '0' or '1'. The winner of the left half is not necessarily the maximum of S1.\n\n          Example: if the left half's bracket has all '0' outcomes, then the winner is the minimum of S1.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for the left half to have a winner <= x is: there exists a number y (the winner) in S1 such that y <= x, and the entire left half's bracket (with outcomes s[0:n-1]) allows y to be the winner given the set S1.\n\n          But note: we can choose S1 arbitrarily from the available numbers (as long as |S1|=2^(n-1)).\n\n          Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for x to win is:\n\n            Condition1: There exists a subset S1 of size 2^(n-1) from [1, 2^n] \\ {x} such that:\n\n                - The winner of the left half (computed by the bracket with outcomes s[0:n-1]) can be any number in S1 (but we require that the winner is <= x) and also the entire set S1 must be assignable to the left half.\n\n            But note: we are free to choose the assignment (so the set S1 is arbitrary). The only constraint is that the winner of the left half must be <= x.\n\n          How to check that the left half (with its own bracket and outcomes) can have a winner <= x, given that we can assign any distinct numbers from the available set?\n\n          Actually, we can choose S1 arbitrarily. Then, the condition is: the left half's tournament (with outcomes s[0:n-1]) must be able to produce a winner that is <= x.\n\n          But note: the left half's tournament is the same structure as the entire tournament but for n-1 rounds. The outcome string for the left half is s[0:n-1] (the same as the original, but for n-1 rounds).\n\n          And similarly, the entire tournament for n-1 rounds must be able to have a winner <= x.\n\n          However, we can generalize:\n\n            Let f(n, x, s) be the condition that in a tournament of 2^n teams with outcome string s (of length n) we can assign distinct numbers from 1 to 2^n such that the champion is x.\n\n          Then, we can use dynamic programming or recursion by splitting the problem.\n\n          But note: n is up to 18, and the numbers are up to 2^18, so we cannot iterate over subsets.\n\n        Insight:\n\n          Instead of focusing on the set S1, we can consider the constraints that the tournament imposes on the relative ordering of the numbers.\n\n          In particular, the tournament with fixed outcomes s imposes a total order on the 2^n numbers. However, since we can assign arbitrarily, we can choose which numbers go where.\n\n          But note: the outcome functions (min and max) are monotonic.\n\n          We can think: the champion x must be the maximum (if all rounds were '1') or the minimum (if all rounds were '0') of the entire set? Not exactly.\n\n          Actually, the rounds are fixed. The entire tournament can be seen as a sequence of comparisons. The champion must win all its matches. In each match, the condition is:\n\n            In round i (from the bottom up, i=0 to n-1), the champion must be compared to one other team (and possibly others indirectly) and must satisfy:\n\n              In round0 (first round): the champion must be compared to one direct opponent and win according to s[0].\n              In round1: the champion must be compared to the winner of another match, and so on.\n\n          However, the champion's value must be in a specific relation to the values of all other teams.\n\n          Specifically, consider the entire path from the champion to the leaves. Along the path, the champion must defeat the opponents. But also, the bracket structure means that the champion must be compared to all other teams indirectly.\n\n          But note: the bracket is single elimination, so the champion only meets n opponents (one per round). However, the outcomes of the matches that the champion does not play also affect the available opponents.\n\n        Another known solution for similar problems (like \"Predicting Evolution\" or \"Tournament\") is to use a greedy assignment of the numbers.\n\n        However, after reading the example inputs and outputs:\n\n          Example 1: \n            Input: n=3, s=\"101\"\n            Output: 4 5 6 7\n\n          Example 2:\n            Input: n=1, s=\"1\"\n            Output: 2\n\n          Example 3:\n            Input: n=2, s=\"01\"\n            Output: 2 3\n\n        Let me try to understand with n=1, s=\"1\": \n          There are 2 teams. The tournament has one game (round0, which is the only round). Outcome is '1': higher skill wins.\n\n          Then, the champion must be the team with the higher skill. The two teams have skills 1 and 2. The champion is the one with 2.\n\n          But wait, the output is \"2\", so the winning integer is 2.\n\n          Now, n=2, s=\"01\": \n            Teams: 4 teams (skills 1,2,3,4). The bracket:\n\n              Round0 (first round): two games: (1,2) and (3,4)\n              Round1 (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine all possible integers \\( x \\) such that there exists a permutation of skills \\( p \\) (a permutation of integers from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) where the team with skill \\( x \\) wins the tournament. The tournament's outcome in each phase is determined by a given string \\( s \\), where each character indicates whether the higher or lower skill team wins in that phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament consists of \\( n \\) phases, each reducing the number of teams by half until one champion remains. Each phase's outcome is determined by a character in the string \\( s \\): '1' means the higher skill team wins, and '0' means the lower skill team wins. The challenge is to find all integers \\( x \\) (from 1 to \\( 2^n \\)) that can be the champion under some permutation of skills.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For \\( x \\) to be the champion, it must satisfy specific conditions derived from the tournament's structure and the outcome string \\( s \\). These conditions are determined by recursively checking if \\( x \\) can win each phase based on the outcome rules and the remaining teams.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a recursive approach to validate each candidate \\( x \\). For each \\( x \\), we simulate the tournament phases, ensuring that \\( x \\) can win each match by either being the highest or lowest skill in the required manner. The simulation involves partitioning the remaining teams into two halves for each phase and checking feasibility based on the outcome string.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each candidate \\( x \\) from 1 to \\( 2^n \\). For each \\( x \\), it processes \\( n \\) phases, each involving partitioning teams and checking conditions. The overall complexity is \\( O(n \\cdot 2^n) \\), which is feasible since \\( n \\) is up to 18.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    s_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n\n    \n    def is_valid(x):\n        low = 1\n        high = total_teams\n        \n        left = 0\n        right = total_teams - 1\n        \n        def dfs(phase, l, r):\n            if l == r:\n                return True\n                \n            mid = (l + r) // 2\n            next_phase = phase + 1\n            if next_phase >= n:\n                return True\n                \n            outcome_char = s_str[n - 1 - next_phase]\n            \n            if outcome_char == '1':\n                if x < mid:\n                    return False\n                else:\n                    return dfs(next_phase, 2*mid, 2*mid + (r - l))\n            else:\n                if x > mid:\n                    return False\n                else:\n                    return dfs(next_phase, 2*mid, 2*mid + (r - l))\n                    \n        return dfs(0, 0, total_teams-1)\n        \n    results = []\n    for x in range(1, total_teams + 1):\n        if is_valid(x):\n            results.append(str(x))\n            \n    print(\" \".join(results))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer \\( n \\) (number of phases) and a string \\( s \\) (outcome determinants for each phase).\n2. **Total Teams Calculation**: The total number of teams is \\( 2^n \\).\n3. **Validation Function (`is_valid`)**: This function checks if a given \\( x \\) can be the champion.
