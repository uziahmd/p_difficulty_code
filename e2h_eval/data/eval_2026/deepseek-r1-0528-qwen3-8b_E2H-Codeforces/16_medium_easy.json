Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and a set of n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a common border of nonzero length. This is equivalent to crossing one road at a time (because the borders between two blocks are segments of one or more roads? Actually, note: the problem says \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". The key is that adjacent blocks share a part of a road (so we cross one road in one step).\n\n However, note that the movement condition: we can only move if the common border has nonzero length. This implies that we cannot cross multiple roads at an intersection (unless we have to go through an intersection that is the crossing point of several roads, but note: the problem says that the blocks are separated by the roads. \n\n But wait: the problem says that the roads are infinite lines. So two different roads intersect at most at one point. The blocks are the connected regions. Two blocks are adjacent (have a common border) if and only if they are separated by exactly one road? Actually, no: the common border might be the union of parts of several roads? \n\n Let me clarify: the plane is divided by multiple lines. The arrangement of lines: two adjacent regions (blocks) share a segment of one of the lines. However, at an intersection, multiple lines meet, and the regions around the intersection are adjacent via the segments of the lines.\n\n But note: the movement condition says \"if the length of their common border is nonzero\", meaning that we can only step across one contiguous segment of a road (which is part of one line). Therefore, crossing a single road (line) counts as one step.\n\n However, consider: if home and university are separated by k distinct roads, then we must cross each of these roads at least once. But can we cross them in any order? And note: sometimes we might cross a road twice (if we go back and forth) but we want the minimum steps.\n\n But observe: we start in a block and end in a block. Each step crosses one road. The minimum number of steps is the minimum number of roads we must cross to get from the home block to the university block.\n\n However, note: two blocks might be separated by more than one road, but we can cross one road at a time. But the problem is: how many roads separate the two blocks?\n\n Actually, the entire plane is divided by the roads. Each road is a line. We can assign a sign to each side of the road for every line. For a given line equation a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0, we can define a half-plane. Then, the home and the university are in some blocks. We can represent the block by a vector of signs for each road.\n\n Specifically, for each road i, we can check the sign of (a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i) at the home and at the university.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require us to use the points on the road. Since the home and university are not on any road, we can do:\n\n   For each road i:\n        s1_i = sign(a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i)\n        s2_i = sign(a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i)\n\n Then, the home and the university are in the same block if and only if for every road i, s1_i == s2_i.\n\n But note: the problem does not ask for the number of roads separating the two blocks. It asks for the minimum number of steps (each step crossing one road) to get from the home block to the university block.\n\n However, observe: if the two blocks are separated by k roads, then we must cross at least k roads. But note: when we cross a road, we change the side for that road. To get from the home block to the university block, we need to change the side for all the roads for which s1_i != s2_i.\n\n But wait: is it possible to cross the same road twice? Then we would return to the original side. However, the goal is to minimize the steps. The minimal way is to cross each road that separates the two blocks exactly once.\n\n However, consider: what if two blocks are separated by two roads? Then we must cross both. But note: the roads are linear and the arrangement is such that we can cross one road and then the other, and each crossing is a step. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two blocks.\n\n But wait: is there a possibility that we can cross two roads at the same time? No, because two different roads intersect at a single point, and at that point we are allowed to change two sides only if we are at the intersection. However, the problem says we move from block to block and the step requires a nonzero common border. The common border is a segment of one road. Therefore, we cannot cross two roads in one step.\n\n So the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two blocks.\n\n However, let me verify with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n     Input: \n         Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), Roads: [ (0,1,0), (1,0,0) ]\n\n     Road1: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0. \n        At home (1,1): 0*1+1*1+0 = 1 > 0.\n        At university (-1,-1): 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 < 0.\n\n     Road2: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0.\n        At home: 1*1+0+0 = 1 > 0.\n        At university: 1*(-1)+0+0 = -1 < 0.\n\n     So both roads separate the two points. Then according to the above, the answer would be 2.\n\n     Example output: 2.\n\n Example 2:\n     Input: \n         Home: (1,1), University: (-1,-1), Roads: [ (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,-3) ]\n\n     Road1: x=0 -> home: 1>0, university: -1<0 -> separates.\n     Road2: y=0 -> home: 1>0, university: -1<0 -> separates.\n     Road3: x+y-3=0 -> home: 1+1-3 = -1 <0; university: -1-1-3=-5<0 -> same side.\n\n     So two roads separate the two points. Output: 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Count the number of roads for which the sign of (a_i*x1+b_i*y1+c_i) is different from the sign of (a_i*x2+b_i*y2+c_i).\n\n However, we must be cautious: how to compute the sign? We cannot use floating point because the numbers can be large (up to 10^6). But we can use integer comparison.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read x1, y1\n   Read x2, y2\n   Read n\n   For i in range(n):\n        Read a, b, c\n\n        f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n        If (f1 < 0 and f2 >= 0) or (f1 >=0 and f2 <0): then this road separates the two points.\n\n   But wait: we have to consider the sign. However, note: the sign can be negative or positive. But the equation defines two half-planes. The sign of the expression (without being zero) tells which side we are on.\n\n   However, the problem states that the points are not on the road, so f1 and f2 are not zero.\n\n   But we must compare the signs. We can do:\n\n        if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0):\n            then count++\n\n   However, note: the sign function is defined by the value, and the road equation can be multiplied by -1 without changing the line. So the sign convention matters? Actually, the half-plane is defined by the equation. But note: if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then the sign flips. However, when we compare two points, we are consistent: we use the same equation for both.\n\n   But here's the catch: the equation is given as a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0. We don't know the direction of the normal. However, the separation condition is symmetric: if the two points are on opposite sides, then regardless of the sign of the equation, we will get opposite signs.\n\n   Example: consider the road x=0. Equation: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0. For (1,0): 1>0, for (-1,0): -1<0 -> opposite.\n\n   Now, if we write the same road as -1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0, then for (1,0): -1<0, for (-1,0): 1>0 -> still opposite.\n\n   So the condition is: if the two points are on opposite sides, then (a_i*x1+b_i*y1+c_i) and (a_i*x2+b_i*y2+c_i) have opposite signs.\n\n   Therefore, we can simply check:\n\n        if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0):\n            count++\n\n   But note: what about the case where one is positive and the other is negative? We have to avoid zeros (but the problem says the points are not on the road).\n\n   However, we must also consider the possibility of integer overflow? The values can be up to 10^6, and a, b, c up to 10^6, and x,y up to 10^6. Then:\n\n        a*x1 can be up to 10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12, and similarly for b*y1. Then adding c (which is up to 10^6) might not cause overflow in Python integers (since Python integers are arbitrary precision, but the numbers are within 10^12+10^6, which is acceptable). However, we are comparing two such numbers.\n\n   But note: the problem says the input numbers are integers, so we are safe.\n\n   However, there is a caveat: the sign comparison. What if the computed value is very large and we are concerned about the sign? But since we are only comparing the sign, we can use the above.\n\n   But wait: what if the expression equals zero? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   Therefore, code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a, b, c = data[0], data[1], data[2]\n\n            # Compute the value for home and university\n            f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            # Check if they are on opposite sides\n            if (f1 < 0 and f2 > 0) or (f1 > 0 and f2 < 0):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   Let me test with the examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Home (1,1), University (-1,-1), roads: [ (0,1,0), (1,0,0) ]\n\n        Road1: (0,1,0): \n            f1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1\n            f2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1\n            Condition: (1>0 and -1<0) -> true, so count becomes 1.\n\n        Road2: (1,0,0):\n            f1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1\n            f2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1\n            Condition: true, count becomes 2.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n   Example 2:\n        Home (1,1), University (-1,-1), roads: [ (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,-3) ]\n\n        Road1: (1,0,0): same as above -> separates, count=1.\n        Road2: (0,1,0): same as above -> separates, count=2.\n        Road3: (1,1,-3):\n            f1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 1+1-3 = -1\n            f2 = 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5\n            Condition: (-1<0 and -5<0) -> same sign, so no.\n\n        Output: 2.\n\n   This matches the example.\n\n   However, note: the problem statement says that the roads divide the plane and we are to move from one block to another. But is the minimal steps always equal to the number of roads separating the two blocks?\n\n   Consider: the arrangement of lines. Each road is a line. The blocks are defined by the arrangement. The home and university are in two different blocks. The minimal path must cross each separating road exactly once. Why?\n\n   Because if we cross a road, we flip the side for that road. To get from the starting block to the target block, we must have flipped the side for every road that separates the two. And we can do it in any order, but we must flip each one. Each flip is a step (crossing one road). So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two.\n\n   However, note: sometimes we might have to cross a road more than once if the arrangement is complex? But actually, the minimal path is a straight path from home to university that crosses the roads in order. The minimal number of crossings is the number of roads that separate the two.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is the count we just computed.\n\n   But wait: what if the two points are already in the same block? Then the count is 0, and we output 0.\n\n   Example: same block.\n\n        Home (1,1), University (2,2) and one road: x+y=0 (which does not pass through either).\n\n        Road: (1,1,0): \n            f1 = 1+1 = 2\n            f2 = 2+2 = 4\n            same sign -> not separated.\n\n        Then we output 0.\n\n   Another example: two roads, both separating the two points.\n\n        Home (1,1), University (2,2) and two roads: \n            Road1: x=0 -> separates (1,1) and (2,2)? \n                Actually, (1,1) is on the positive side (x>0) and (2,2) is also positive -> same side.\n\n        So no, that doesn't separate.\n\n        How about: \n            Road1: x+y=0 -> same side for (1,1) and (2,2) (both positive)\n            Road2: x-y=0 -> (1,1): 0 -> wait, but the point (1,1) is on the road? Actually, no: the problem says the points are not on the road. So we have to choose a road that separates (1,1) and (2,2). \n\n        Example: Road: x+y=3 -> (1,1): 1+1=2 <3 -> negative? Let me set the equation as x+y-3=0. Then:\n            (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0\n            (2,2): 2+2-3 = 1 >0 -> separates.\n\n        Now, if we have two roads: \n            Road1: x+y-3=0 -> separates\n            Road2: x-y-1=0 -> (1,1): 1-1-1=-1 <0, (2,2): 2-2-1=-1 <0 -> same side.\n\n        Then the count is 1.\n\n        Now, if we have two roads that both separate (1,1) and (2,2):\n\n            Road1: x+y-3=0 -> separates (as above)\n            Road2: x+y-4=0 -> (1,1): 1+1-4=-2 <0, (2,2): 2+2-4=0 -> wait, (2,2) is on the road? But the problem says the university is not on the road. So we cannot have that.\n\n        Alternatively, Road2: x+y-5=0 -> (1,1): -3, (2,2): -1 -> same side.\n\n        So we need two different roads that separate (1,1) and (2,2). For example:\n\n            Road1: x+y-3=0 -> separates (1,1) and (2,2)\n            Road2: x-y-1=0 -> (1,1): 1-1-1=-1, (2,2): 2-2-1=-1 -> same side.\n\n        How about Road2: x+y-4=0? Then (2,2) is on the road? So we cannot.\n\n        Another Road2: x-2y+1=0 -> (1,1): 1-2+1=0 -> invalid (point on road) so skip.\n\n        Let me try: Road2: x-2y+2=0 -> (1,1): 1-2+2=1>0, (2,2): 2-4+2=0 -> again on the road.\n\n        Actually, we can choose:\n\n            Road1: x+y-3=0 -> separates\n            Road2: x-2y+1=0 -> (1,1): 1-2+1=0 -> invalid.\n\n        Instead, let me choose:\n\n            Road1: x+y-3=0 -> separates\n            Road2: x+y-2=0 -> (1,1): 1+1-2=0 -> invalid.\n\n        We need to avoid the points. Let me choose:\n\n            Road1: x+y-3=0\n            Road2: 2x+y-5=0 -> (1,1): 2+1-5=-2, (2,2): 4+2-5=1 -> separates.\n\n        Then both roads separate (1,1) and (2,2). Then count=2.\n\n        Then the answer is 2.\n\n   Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the roads are given and the points are not on any road. We don't have to worry about zeros.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   But wait: what if the computed value is zero? The problem says the points are not on the road, so we assume f1 and f2 are non-zero. However, due to integer arithmetic, we are safe.\n\n   One more edge: the sign function for negative and positive. We are using strict inequalities. This is correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n            # Calculate the value for home and university\n            val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n            val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n            # If they have opposite signs, then this road separates the two points.\n            if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   However, wait: what if the road equation is defined with a negative leading coefficient? The sign comparison is still valid because we are comparing the two values.\n\n   Example: same road equation but multiplied by -1.\n\n        Original: a*x+b*y+c=0 -> separates if (a*x1+b*y1+c) and (a*x2+b*y2+c) have opposite signs.\n\n        If we use -a*x -b*y -c =0, then the values become -val1 and -val2.\n\n        Then (val1<0 and val2>0) becomes (-val1>0 and -val2<0) which is the same condition as (val1<0 and val2>0) because if val1 is negative then -val1 is positive, and if val2 is positive then -val2 is negative.\n\n        Similarly, (val1>0 and val2<0) becomes (-val1<0 and -val2>0) which is the same condition.\n\n   Therefore, the code is robust.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'] -> output 2.\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input: ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'] -> output 2.\n\n   But the problem example input is given as two separate strings? Actually, the problem example input is given as two separate examples. The first example input is:\n\n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\n   and the second is:\n\n        \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n   Our code reads from stdin. We can run it with:\n\n        Example1: \n            $ echo \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\" | python3 solution.py\n\n        Example2:\n            $ echo \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\" | python3 solution.py\n\n   We expect 2 and 2.\n\n   However, note: the example input format in the problem is:\n\n        The first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1\n        The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2\n        The third line contains an integer n\n        Then n lines, each with three integers.\n\n   Our code reads exactly that.\n\n   Therefore, we are done.\n\n   But wait: I just saw the example input representation in the problem statement:\n\n        Input: \n          ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        Output:\n          ['2', '2']\n\n   The problem expects two answers. But note: the example input is two separate test cases? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n        ... (problem statement)\n\n        Example\n        Input\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n        Output\n        ['2', '2']\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the input format for multiple test cases. The initial description says:\n\n        The first line contains two integers (home coordinates)\n        The second line contains two integers (university coordinates)\n        The third line contains an integer n\n        Then n lines.\n\n   So each test case is independent. But the example input is given as a list of two strings. In competitive programming problems, the input is usually one test case. \n\n   But looking at the problem statement, it says:\n\n        Input\n        The first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.\n        The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.\n        The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.\n\n   So the example input is two separate test cases? Or is the example showing two different inputs and outputs?\n\n   Actually, the example input is shown as two strings. But in the problem, there is only one test case per run. \n\n   However, the problem statement says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives an example input and output. \n\n   Since the problem says \"Output the answer to the problem\", and the example input has two test cases, but the output has two answers, it suggests that the problem might have multiple test cases.\n\n   But wait: the constraints say n>=1 and up to 300, and the points are integers. There is no mention of multiple test cases.\n\n   Let me read the problem statement again: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the input and output.\n\n   However, the example input is given as two strings. This might be just two examples.\n\n   Clarification: in competitive programming problems, the input format is fixed. The example input format is:\n\n        Example input 1:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n\n        Example input 2:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n   And the expected output for each is 2.\n\n   But the problem does not say how many test cases there are. The initial description does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   However, the example input is given as two separate strings, but the problem statement does not indicate that there are multiple test cases.\n\n   Looking at the constraints: n from 1 to 300, and the coordinates from -10^6 to 10^6.\n\n   The problem says \"The first line ...\" etc. So we assume one test case per run.\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input is two separate test cases. However, the problem statement does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n   Let me check: the problem says \"Input\" and then describes the format. It does not say \"There are t test cases\". \n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   However, the example input in the problem statement is two separate examples. \n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input and output format. It does not specify the number of test cases. So we must assume that the input is for one test case.\n\n   But the example input is provided as two examples. This might be a formatting issue.\n\n   Conclusion: the problem expects one test case per input.\n\n   Therefore, our code is complete.\n\n   Let me submit the code as below.\n\n   Note: There is a possibility that the problem intended multiple test cases, but the example input is two separate runs. However, the problem statement does not specify.\n\n   Since the constraints are small (n<=300) and the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the typical structure is one test case, we proceed.\n\n   Code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n            if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n   However, wait: what if the value is zero? The problem says the points are not on the road, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   But note: the equation might be defined such that the expression is zero at one of the points? The problem states: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so we are safe.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples.\n\n   Example1: \n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   Example2:\n        Input:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, wait: the example input string representation was:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n   But when we run the program, we must provide the input as:\n\n        Example1: \n            First line: \"1 1\"\n            Second line: \"-1 -1\"\n            Third line: \"2\"\n            Then two lines: \"0 1 0\", \"1 0 0\"\n\n        Example2: \n            First line: \"1 1\"\n            Second line: \"-1 -1\"\n            Third line: \"3\"\n            Then three lines: \"1 0 0\", \"0 1 0\", \"1 1 -3\"\n\n   The code reads from stdin. We can test with the provided example strings by:\n\n        Example1: \n            $ echo -e \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\" | python3 solution.py\n\n        Example2:\n            $ echo -e \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\" | python3 solution.py\n\n   But note: the echo command with -e might not work in all shells. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        Example1: \n            $ cat input.txt | python3 solution.py\n\n   Where input.txt contains:\n\n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   This should be fine.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n        n = int(input())\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n            val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n            val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n            if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n                count += 1\n        print(count)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates the two blocks. The key observation is that each road that separates the home and university points must be crossed exactly once, and the minimal number of steps is simply the count of such roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads (infinite lines) separate two given points (home and university) in a plane. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university are located in different blocks if they lie on opposite sides of one or more roads.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, we check whether the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, crossing this road is necessary to move from one block to the other. The total number of such roads gives the minimal steps required.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both points. If the signs of these values differ, the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus the road separates them.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the `n` roads exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. Hence, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraint `n ≤ 300`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n    n = int(input())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, defined by the equation `a*x + b*y + c = 0`, the code calculates the value of this equation at both the home and university points.\n3. **Checking Separation**: If the signs of these values differ, the points lie on opposite sides of the road, indicating that the road separates them. The count of such roads is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of roads separating the two points is printed, which represents the minimal steps needed to move from the home block to the university block, as each step involves crossing one such road.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, leveraging simple arithmetic and comparison operations to determine the necessary crossings, ensuring optimal performance.",
