The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to change at most one number. The goal is to find the longest subsegment that can be made strictly increasing by changing at most one element.\n\n Observation:\n 1. Without any change, we can have a contiguous strictly increasing segment. But we are allowed to fix one broken part.\n\n Steps:\n - We can precompute:\n   * `left[i]`: the length of the strictly increasing sequence ending exactly at index i (with a[i] being the last element).\n   * `right[i]`: the length of the strictly increasing sequence starting exactly at index i (with a[i] being the first element).\n\n How to compute `left`:\n   left[0] = 1\n   for i from 1 to n-1:\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            left[i] = 1\n\n Similarly, `right`:\n   right[n-1] = 1\n   for i from n-2 down to 0:\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right[i] = 1\n\n However, note: we are allowed to fix one element. So we can consider:\n\n Option 1: The entire segment might be fixed by changing one element in the middle. Then the candidate would be a combination of an increasing segment ending at i-1 and an increasing segment starting at i+1, with the condition that a[i-1] < a[i+1] (if we are going to change a[i]), or also consider adjacent elements.\n\n But note: the problem allows changing one number to any integer. So we can fix a break by setting the broken element to a value between its neighbors.\n\n Let's denote:\n   candidate1: without changing any element, the maximum increasing segment is the answer if we are allowed to change one? Actually, we can also use the possibility of not changing any element.\n\n However, note: we are allowed at most one change. So we can have segments that are already strictly increasing (with no change) and then those that need one change.\n\n We can consider two types of segments:\n   Type A: Entirely strictly increasing (then we don't need a change) -> but we might be able to extend it by including a broken part that we fix.\n\n Actually, we can think of:\n\n 1. The candidate might be a contiguous strictly increasing segment (with no change). So we can take the max of all such segments.\n\n 2. Or, we can consider segments that have exactly one \"break\" (i.e., one place where the strictly increasing condition fails). Then we can fix that break.\n\n How to check for a break?\n\n Consider a segment [l, r]. We require that if we change at most one element, then the entire segment becomes strictly increasing.\n\n We can try to consider each index i as the one that might be changed. Then we look at the segment from l to r, and the only violation is at i.\n\n Conditions for a segment [l, r] with one change at i:\n\n   - The entire segment must be almost strictly increasing, meaning that if we remove the element at i (or change it appropriately), the rest must be strictly increasing and the changes at the boundaries (if i is not at the ends) must allow the value we set for a[i] to fit.\n\n But note: we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily. So the conditions are:\n\n   - The subarray excluding the changed element must be strictly increasing? Not exactly: because the change can be done arbitrarily, we only require that the entire segment (after changing one element) is strictly increasing.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the entire segment is originally strictly increasing except for one break. It requires that after changing one element (to any integer) the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n So, the idea:\n\n   We can consider two cases:\n\n   Case 1: The entire segment is already strictly increasing. Then we can use the standard `left` and `right` arrays.\n\n   Case 2: There is exactly one violation (at some position i) and we fix that element.\n\n   How do we combine?\n\n   We can consider merging two increasing parts when the two parts can be connected by changing the element at the break.\n\n   Specifically, consider two consecutive increasing sequences: one ending at i-1 and one starting at i+1. Then the segment from the start of the second part to the end of the first part, but with the middle element (at i) removed, must be strictly increasing. But actually, we are going to keep the element at i and change it? Or remove it? \n\n   Actually, we are going to change the element at i. Then the condition for the entire segment [l, r] is that:\n\n        For j from l to i-1: strictly increasing, and",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsegment of a sequence where we can change at most one number to make the entire subsegment strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently checking all possible subsegments that meet the criteria by leveraging precomputed arrays and handling edge cases carefully.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - `left[i]` stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at index `i`.\n   - `right[i]` stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at index `i`.\n\n2. **Initial Maximum Length**:\n   - The initial maximum length is derived from the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any modifications.\n\n3. **Handling Single Modification**:\n   - For each element in the array, consider it as the only modified element. Check if the left and right parts of this element can form a strictly increasing sequence when combined with the modified element.\n   - Specifically, check if `a[i-1] < a[i+1]` (if modifying `a[i]`). If true, the candidate length is `left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1` (accounting for the modified element).\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Handle cases where the array has fewer than three elements, as these cannot have a middle element to modify.\n\n5. **Result Calculation**:\n   - The result is the maximum value between the initial maximum length and the best candidate found during the single modification check.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n <= 2:\n        print(n)\n        return\n        \n    left = [1] * n\n    right = [1] * n\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left[i] = left[i-1] + 1\n            \n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right[i] = right[i+1] + 1\n            \n    max_len = max(left) if n > 0 else 0\n    max_len = max(max_len, right[0], left[-1])\n    \n    ans = max_len\n    \n    for i in range(1, n-1):\n        if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n            total = left[i-1] + right[i+1] + 1\n            if total > ans:\n                ans = total\n                \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length and the sequence itself.\n2. **Edge Handling**: If the sequence has two or fewer elements, the answer is simply the length of the sequence since no modifications are needed or possible.\n3. **Precomputing Arrays**: The `left` array is filled by iterating from the start to the end, incrementing the count if the current element is greater than the previous. The `right` array is filled by iterating from the end to the start, incrementing the count if the current element is less than the next.\n4. **Initial Maximum**: The initial maximum length is determined by the longest strictly increasing subsegment found in either direction (left or right).\n5. **Single Modification Check**: For each element (except edges), check if modifying it allows merging adjacent increasing subsegments. The condition `a[i-1] < a[i+1]` ensures the merged segment can be strictly increasing with a suitable modification.\n6. **Output Result**: The maximum length found, considering both unmodified and single-modified segments, is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all potential candidates for the longest valid subsegment by leveraging precomputed arrays and handling edge cases separately, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
