Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of (li, ri, costi)\n Conditions: \n   - We need two distinct vouchers i and j such that:\n        (ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1) = x   [total duration is x]\n   - The two vouchers do not intersect: meaning either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\n Steps:\n\n Observation: The total duration condition is (duration_i + duration_j = x). So if we let d_i = ri - li + 1, then we require d_i + d_j = x.\n\n Also, the two vouchers must be disjoint. That means one ends before the other starts.\n\n Since the problem constraints are up to 200,000 for n and the days (from 1 to 200,000), we can try to use an array-based method.\n\n Approach:\n\n 1. Precompute the duration for each voucher. Then, we note that we are only interested in pairs (i, j) with duration_i + duration_j = x.\n\n 2. We can group the vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we store all the vouchers (or at least some information) that have that duration.\n\n    However, note: we also need to check non-overlapping condition.\n\n 3. For a fixed duration d, we might look for the complementary duration x-d. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we want to find a voucher with duration x-d that does not overlap.\n\n    But how to check non-overlapping? Two vouchers (l1, r1) and (l2, r2) do not overlap if r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1.\n\n    Without loss of generality, we can assume we are pairing a voucher from duration d (say [l1, r1]) with a voucher from duration (x-d) [l2, r2]. Then we require either:\n        r1 < l2   OR   r2 < l1\n\n    However, note: we don't know which one comes first. But we can fix an order. Let's say we consider the first voucher as (l1, r1) and the second as (l2, r2). Then the condition is that they don't overlap.\n\n    We can break the condition into two cases:\n\n        Case 1: The first voucher ends before the second starts: r1 < l2.\n        Case 2: The second voucher ends before the first starts: r2 < l1.\n\n    But note: the two vouchers are symmetric, so we can choose one and then the other arbitrarily.\n\n    However, we are storing by duration. We can try to fix the order by the time intervals.\n\n 4. Alternate approach: We can preprocess the vouchers and then use two pointers or binary search to find non-overlapping pairs.\n\n    But note: the total number of pairs is large, so we must use grouping by duration.\n\n 5. Steps:\n\n    a. Group the vouchers by duration. Let's create a dictionary `groups` where key = duration, value = list of tuples (l, r, cost) for that duration.\n\n    b. We are going to iterate over durations d from 1 to maybe max_duration (which is at most 200000). For each d, if (x-d) exists in the dictionary, then we consider pairs.\n\n    c. But we cannot iterate over all pairs because there could be many vouchers per duration.\n\n    d. Instead, for each duration d, we can store the vouchers in two ways:\n\n        - One way is to sort the list of vouchers by their start (or end) and then use binary search to find non-overlapping ones.\n\n    However, note: we are matching two different groups: group d and group (x-d). We need to consider:\n\n        For a voucher in group d (with interval [l1, r1]), we want to find a voucher in group (x-d) (with interval [l2, r2]) such that either r1 < l2 or r2 < l1.\n\n    e. But note: if d == x-d, then the two vouchers are from the same duration. Then we must ensure they are disjoint.\n\n    f. We can break the problem into two parts:\n\n        Part 1: For a given duration d and its complement s = x-d, we want to consider two cases:\n\n            Case 1: The voucher from d ends before the voucher from s starts (r1 < l2).\n            Case 2: The voucher from s ends before the voucher from d starts (r2 < l1).\n\n        But note: these two cases are symmetric. Actually, the condition for non-overlap is independent of which voucher is which. However, we can fix the order: \n\n            Condition: The two intervals [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] do not overlap if max(r1, r2) < min(l1, l2) is false? Actually, no: the standard non-overlap condition is that one ends before the other starts.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the two intervals are disjoint if the entire interval of the first is contained in the second? No, that would be overlapping. Actually, disjoint if the intervals do not share any common point.\n\n        The condition is: \n            [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] are disjoint if r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1.\n\n        This condition does not assume which one is first.\n\n    g. How to efficiently combine?\n\n        We can preprocess the two groups (for duration d and x-d) separately.\n\n        For group d: We want to quickly, for a given voucher [l1, r1] (from d), find a voucher in group (x-d) such that either:\n            Option A: r1 < l2   (then the voucher from x-d must start after r1)\n            Option B: r2 < l1   (then the voucher from x-d must end before l1)\n\n        And we want the minimal cost for the pair.\n\n        However, note: the two conditions are independent.\n\n    h. We can precompute for group (x-d):\n\n        - A sorted list by start (l) and by end (r) might be useful.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            For group (x-d), we can create two structures:\n\n                Structure 1: All the vouchers (l, r, cost) sorted by l (start). Then for condition A (r1 < l2), we require a voucher in group (x-d) that starts at l2 > r1. Then we can take the minimum cost for any voucher in group (x-d) that starts above r1.\n\n                Structure 2: All the vouchers (l, r, cost) sorted by r (end). Then for condition B (r2 < l1), we require a voucher in group (x-d) that ends at r2 < l1. Then we can take the minimum cost for any voucher in group (x-d) that ends below l1.\n\n        But note: we are considering two different groups. We can precompute for each group (if we are going to use multiple d) then we can build for each duration the best cost for a given start or end condition.\n\n    i. However, note that we are iterating over d from 1 to max_duration (but we only consider d and x-d). We must avoid processing the same pair twice (if d < x-d, then we process once; if d == x-d, then we process once and then we have to consider pairs within the same group).\n\n    j. Plan:\n\n        Step 1: Read input and group by duration.\n\n        Step 2: Precompute for each duration d (that appears) a data structure for the group:\n\n            - For the group, we have a list of (l, r, cost). We can create:\n\n                Option A: A sorted list by l (start) and then for each l, we keep the minimal cost for a voucher with start <= some value? Actually, we want to quickly query: what is the minimal cost for a voucher in this group with l >= some value (for condition A) or l <= some value (for condition B)? \n\n            Actually, we need two things:\n\n                For condition A (when matching with group d): we want to find in the other group (x-d) a voucher with l2 > r1. So we can:\n\n                    - Precompute for each group (by duration) a sorted list by start and then a suffix minimum array (min cost from index i to the end for increasing start). Similarly, for condition B, we want to find a voucher with r2 < l1, so we can precompute a sorted list by end and then a prefix minimum array.\n\n        Step 3: Iterate over durations d that are <= x//2 (to avoid duplicates) and also consider when d == x-d.\n\n        k. Implementation:\n\n            Let's define two dictionaries:\n\n                groups: maps duration -> list of (l, r, cost)\n\n            Then, for each duration d (from 1 to max_duration) such that d <= x-d and (d, x-d) exists in the groups, we process.\n\n            However, note: if d > x-d, then we skip because we will process when d becomes x-d? Actually, we should process every pair (d, x-d) only once. But we can do:\n\n                Let d_min = 1, d_max = max_duration (which is 200000). We iterate d from 1 to (x//2) (if x is even, then d=x/2 is included; if odd, then d from 1 to floor(x/2)).\n\n            But wait: what if x is even? Then we have d = x/2 and x-d = x/2. Then we are processing the same group. So we must handle that separately.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate d from 1 to x-1, but then we process (d, x-d) and (x-d, d) twice if d != x-d. So we can do:\n\n                For d in range(1, (x//2)+1):\n                    if d == x-d:\n                        # then we consider pairs within the same group (d)\n                    else:\n                        consider pairs between group d and group x-d.\n\n            But note: it is possible that x is even and d = x/2, then we must consider the same group.\n\n        l. Steps for processing:\n\n            Case 1: d != x-d\n\n                For each voucher in group d (with duration d) represented by (l1, r1, cost1):\n\n                    Condition A: We need a voucher in group (x-d) with l2 > r1. Then the cost candidate is cost1 + min_cost_in_group_xd_with_l2_greater_than_r1.\n\n                    Condition B: We need a voucher in group (x-d) with r2 < l1. Then the cost candidate is cost1 + min_cost_in_group_xd_with_r2_less_than_l1.\n\n                Then we take the minimum candidate over all vouchers in group d and group x-d.\n\n            Case 2: d == x-d\n\n                Then we are looking for two distinct vouchers (they can be the same voucher? no, i≠j) in the same group. But note: the two vouchers must not intersect.\n\n                For a voucher (l1, r1, cost1) in group d, we need another voucher (l2, r2, cost2) in group d such that either r1 < l2 or r2 < l1.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    For each voucher, we look for:\n\n                        - In the set of vouchers (excluding itself?) we can precompute two arrays for the same group:\n\n                            Array1: sorted by l (start) and then we can find the minimal cost for a voucher that starts > r1 (condition A: the current voucher ends before the other starts).\n\n                            Array2: sorted by r (end) and then we can find the minimal cost for a voucher that ends < l1 (condition B: the other voucher ends before the current starts).\n\n                But note: we cannot use the same voucher twice, so we have to exclude the current one? Actually, the problem says two distinct vouchers.\n\n            However, building the data structures for each group might be heavy. We have up to 200000 different durations? Actually, the duration d is from 1 to 200000, but the input has n up to 200000, so the distinct durations might be up to 200000, but we only consider those that appear and also d and x-d must exist.\n\n            We can precompute for each duration that appears, two arrays:\n\n                - One sorted by l (start) and then a suffix minimum array (so that for a given start value, we know the minimal cost for any voucher with start >= that value? Actually, for condition A (voucher from x-d must have l2>r1) we need to find the minimal cost in group (x-d) for vouchers with l2>r1. So we can:\n\n                    Sort the group (x-d) by l, and then create an array of (l, cost) and then compute the suffix minimum (from high l to low l, the minimal cost from that point to the end). But actually, we want the minimal cost for any voucher with l2 >= some value. Then we can do:\n\n                        Sort by l (ascending) and then create an array `min_cost_from_index` from the end backwards: \n                            min_suffix[i] = min(cost_i, min_suffix[i+1])\n\n                    Then, for a given r1, we need the smallest l2 that is > r1. Then we can use binary search to find the first index in the sorted-by-l list of group (x-d) such that l2 > r1, and then take min_suffix at that index.\n\n                Similarly, for condition B (voucher from x-d must have r2 < l1):\n\n                    Sort the group (x-d) by r (descending? or ascending) and then we want the minimal cost for any voucher with r2 < l1.\n\n                    Actually, we can sort by r (ascending) and then create a prefix minimum array.\n\n                    Then, we can find the largest r2 that is < l1, and then take the minimal cost for all vouchers with r2 <= that value.\n\n            But wait, for condition B: we want the minimal cost for any voucher with r2 < l1. We can:\n\n                Sort the group (x-d) by r (the end) in increasing order, and then create a prefix minimum array (min_cost_prefix[i] = min(cost_0, cost_1, ..., cost_i)).\n\n                Then, we can find the last index where r <= l1-1 (since r2 < l1, then r2 <= l1-1). Then the minimal cost in that prefix is min_cost_prefix[index].\n\n            However, note: the condition for condition A is: we need a voucher with l2 > r1. We can also do:\n\n                Sort the group (x-d) by l (the start) in increasing order, and then we want to find the minimal cost for any voucher with l2 > r1.\n\n                This is equivalent to: consider the part of the sorted-by-l list from the first index where l >= r1+1 to the end, and take the minimal cost in that part.\n\n            But note: we can use the suffix minimum array for the sorted-by-l list.\n\n            Steps for a group (say group G) for condition A (query: minimal cost for a voucher with l >= L):\n\n                Sort G by l (start) -> list of (l, cost). Then, remove duplicates? No, we keep all.\n\n                Then, create an array `arr_l` = list of l's (sorted) and `arr_cost` = list of costs.\n\n                Then, we want to find the minimal cost for vouchers with l >= L.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    Use bisect_left to find the first index i such that arr_l[i] >= L.\n\n                    Then, the minimal cost from index i to the end is stored in a suffix_min array.\n\n            Similarly, for condition B (query: minimal cost for a voucher with r <= R):\n\n                Sort G by r (end) -> list of (r, cost). Then, create a prefix_min array for the sorted-by-r list.\n\n                Then, find the last index j such that arr_r[j] <= R, then the minimal cost from index 0 to j is the prefix_min[j].\n\n            But note: condition B requires r2 < l1, so R = l1-1.\n\n        m. However, we are going to process each pair of groups (d and x-d) and then for each voucher in group d, we do two queries on group (x-d). The total number of vouchers might be large (n up to 200000) and the distinct durations might be many, but note: the sum of the sizes of all groups is n. But if we do two queries per voucher in group d (and then similarly when d and x-d are swapped, but we are only processing d <= x-d) then the total work is O(n log n) because each query is O(log n) and we do at most 2 * (size of group d) for each d. But the total over all d is the sum_{d} (size(d)) which is n. So overall O(n log n).\n\n        n. But note: we are processing each distinct pair (d, x-d) only once (for d<=x-d). However, if we do:\n\n            For d in [1, x//2]:\n                if d == x-d:\n                    process group d with itself\n                else:\n                    process group d and group x-d\n\n            Then the total number of queries is the sum_{d} (size(d) + size(x-d)) for d from 1 to floor(x/2). But note that the same group may be accessed multiple times (if x-d is also in the range [1, x//2] then we process it again? Actually, we are processing d from 1 to floor(x/2) and then x-d might be greater than x//2. But we are only processing the pair (d, x-d) when d <= x-d. So we are covering each unordered pair once.\n\n            Example: n=4, x=5: \n                d=1, x-d=4 -> process (1,4)\n                d=2, x-d=3 -> process (2,3)\n                d=3, x-d=2 -> but 3>2, so we skip (because we only go up to floor(5/2)=2)\n\n            So we process (1,4) and (2,3) and then if x is even, we process d=x/2.\n\n        o. Implementation details:\n\n            We need to precompute for each duration that appears:\n\n                - A sorted list by l (start) and a suffix minimum array for that list.\n                - A sorted list by r (end) and a prefix minimum array for that list.\n\n            However, we don't need to precompute for every duration from 1 to 200000, only for the ones that appear.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Step 1: Read input and group by duration.\n\n                Step 2: For each duration d that appears, we create two structures:\n\n                    struct1[d] = (list_l, list_cost_sorted_by_l, suffix_min) \n                    struct2[d] = (list_r, list_cost_sorted_by_r, prefix_min)\n\n                But note: we are going to use these structures for two purposes:\n\n                    - When d != x-d: we use struct1 for the group (x-d) for condition A (query by l) and struct2 for the group (x-d) for condition B (query by r).\n\n                    - When d == x-d: we use both structures for the same group.\n\n            Step 3: Initialize answer to a very large number (or infinity).\n\n            Step 4: For d from 1 to x//2 (inclusive) (if x is even, then d goes up to x//2; if odd, then (x//2) is floor, so we do d from 1 to (x//2)):\n\n                Let s = x - d.\n\n                If d == s:\n                    Then we are processing the same group. We need to consider pairs of two distinct vouchers in group d that are non-overlapping.\n\n                    For each voucher in group d (each voucher i: (l_i, r_i, cost_i)):\n                        Condition A: Find the minimal cost in group d for a voucher with l_j >= r_i+1 (so that r_i < l_j). But note: we cannot use the same voucher. So we need to consider distinct indices.\n\n                    How to do without using the same voucher? We can precompute:\n\n                        Sort the entire group d by l (start) and then build a suffix_min array (ignoring the same voucher). But we cannot simply ignore the same voucher because the same voucher might be the minimal one. So we need to consider two separate lists: one that excludes the current voucher? \n\n                    Alternatively, we can precompute two arrays for the same group:\n\n                        Array1 (by start): (l, cost) and then suffix_min array (from the whole group). Then for a given voucher (l_i, r_i, cost_i), we query the suffix_min for l >= r_i+1. However, if the minimal cost found is from the same voucher? \n\n                    But note: the same voucher has l_i, and we are querying for l >= r_i+1. Since r_i+1 > l_i (unless the voucher has duration 0, but duration d>=1 so r_i>=l_i, then r_i+1>=l_i+1) so the same voucher's l_i is less than r_i+1. Therefore, the same voucher is not included in the query. So we are safe.\n\n                    However, we must ensure that the voucher we pick is distinct. The condition by l>=r_i+1 automatically excludes the current voucher because the current voucher's l_i <= r_i (so l_i < r_i+1) and we are requiring l_j>=r_i+1.\n\n                    Similarly, condition B: we require r_j < l_i. The current voucher's r_i >= l_i (so it doesn't satisfy r_j < l_i). Therefore, we don't have to worry about self-pairing.\n\n                    So for each voucher in group d:\n\n                        candidate1 = query_A(struct1[d], r_i)   [minimal cost in group d for a voucher with l >= r_i+1]\n\n                        candidate2 = query_B(struct2[d], l_i-1) [minimal cost in group d for a voucher with r <= l_i-1]\n\n                        total_cost = cost_i + candidate   (if candidate is not infinity)\n\n                    Then update the global answer.\n\n                Else (d != s and both d and s exist in the groups):\n\n                    We process:\n\n                    For each voucher in group d (with (l_i, r_i, cost_i)):\n\n                        candidate1 = query_A(struct1[s], r_i)   [in group s, minimal cost for voucher with l >= r_i+1]\n\n                        candidate2 = query_B(struct2[s], l_i-1) [in group s, minimal cost for voucher with r <= l_i-1]\n\n                        total_cost = cost_i + candidate   (if candidate is not infinity)\n\n                    Then update the global answer.\n\n            Step 5: After processing, if the global answer is still the initial large value, output -1, else output the answer.\n\n        p. But wait: what if the same pair of vouchers is considered twice? We are processing by d and then s=x-d. Each unordered pair (d, s) is processed once. However, note: the two vouchers are from two different groups. And we are iterating by d from 1 to x//2, so each pair (d, s) is processed once.\n\n        q. However, there is an issue: the two conditions (A and B) are independent. We must consider both conditions for each voucher. But note: the two conditions are mutually exclusive? Actually, no: a voucher in group s might satisfy both? But we are querying separately and then taking the minimal cost from the two queries.\n\n        r. But wait: the two conditions are:\n\n            Condition A: The voucher from s must start after the current voucher ends (r_i < l2) -> so the two intervals are [l_i, r_i] and [l2, r2] and r_i < l2.\n\n            Condition B: The voucher from s must end before the current voucher starts (r2 < l_i) -> so the two intervals are [l_i, r_i] and [l2, r2] and r2 < l_i.\n\n        These are two different ways of being disjoint.\n\n        s. Implementation of query_A and query_B:\n\n            Query_A(group, boundary): \n                Input: group (a dictionary key) has been precomputed for condition A (sorted by l) and has a suffix_min array.\n\n                Steps for query_A:\n                    Let arr_l, arr_suffix_min = struct1[group]   # arr_l is sorted list of starts, arr_suffix_min[i] = minimal cost from i to the end.\n\n                    We want the minimal cost for any voucher in the group with l >= boundary (boundary = r_i+1).\n\n                    Use bisect_left to find the first index pos in arr_l such that arr_l[pos] >= boundary.\n\n                    If pos is beyond the last index, then no voucher satisfies condition A.\n\n                    Otherwise, the candidate cost is arr_suffix_min[pos].\n\n            Query_B(group, boundary):\n                Input: group has been precomputed for condition B (sorted by r) and has a prefix_min array.\n\n                Steps for query_B:\n                    Let arr_r, arr_prefix_min = struct2[group]   # arr_r is sorted list of ends, arr_prefix_min[i] = minimal cost from 0 to i.\n\n                    We want the minimal cost for any voucher in the group with r <= boundary (boundary = l_i-1).\n\n                    Use bisect_right to find the last index pos in arr_r such that arr_r[pos] <= boundary.\n\n                    If pos is -1 (meaning no element <= boundary), then no voucher.\n\n                    Otherwise, the candidate cost is arr_prefix_min[pos].\n\n            Note: We must precompute for each group d that appears in the input:\n\n                For condition A (by start l):\n\n                    list_l = sorted(l for (l, r, cost) in group[d])\n                    But we need to keep the costs as well. Actually, we should store: (l, cost) and then sort by l.\n\n                    Then, we create an array of the same length as list_l for the minimal cost from that index to the end.\n\n                    Similarly for condition B (by end r): list_r = sorted(r for (l, r, cost) in group[d]), and then an array of the same length for the minimal cost from the beginning to that index.\n\n            However, note: the same group d might have multiple vouchers with the same start (or end). We need to store the minimal cost for the suffix and prefix. But we are storing the entire list of costs.\n\n            How to build suffix_min for condition A:\n\n                We have a list of (l, cost) for the group, sorted by l.\n\n                Then, we can create an array `suffix_min` of the same length, where:\n\n                    suffix_min[i] = minimum of the costs from index i to the end.\n\n                Similarly, for condition B:\n\n                    We have a list of (r, cost) for the group, sorted by r.\n\n                    Then, prefix_min[i] = minimum of the costs from index 0 to i.\n\n            t. But note: the two structures for the same group d are built independently: one sorted by l and one by r.\n\n            u. Code structure:\n\n                Precomputation for a group (list of (l, r, cost)):\n\n                    def build_A_struct(vouchers):\n                        # Sort by l\n                        sorted_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])   # x[0] is l\n                        arr_l = [v[0] for v in sorted_vouchers]\n                        arr_cost = [v[2] for v in sorted_vouchers]   # we need the cost for suffix_min\n\n                        # Build suffix_min: from last to first, the minimal cost from current to end.\n                        n = len(arr_cost)\n                        suffix_min = [0]*n\n                        if n==0:\n                            return None\n                        suffix_min[-1] = arr_cost[-1]\n                        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n                            suffix_min[i] = min(arr_cost[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n\n                        return (arr_l, suffix_min)\n\n                    Similarly for condition B:\n\n                    def build_B_struct(vouchers):\n                        sorted_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])   # x[1] is r\n                        arr_r = [v[0] for v in sorted_vouchers]   # Wait, no: we want to sort by r, so we should extract the r and then the cost.\n\n                        Actually, let me correct:\n\n                            We have a list of (l, r, cost). We want to sort by r, and then we want an array of the r's and an array of the costs.\n\n                        So:\n\n                            sorted_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n                            arr_r = [v[1] for v in sorted_vouchers]\n                            arr_cost = [v[2] for v in sorted_vouchers]\n\n                        Then build prefix_min:\n\n                            prefix_min = [0]*len(arr_cost)\n                            prefix_min[0] = arr_cost[0]\n                            for i in range(1, len(arr_cost)):\n                                prefix_min[i] = min(arr_cost[i], prefix_min[i-1])\n\n                        Return (arr_r, prefix_min)\n\n            v. However, note: in condition A, we only care about the start (l) and the cost, and we use the start for the condition and the cost for the suffix_min. Similarly, condition B uses the end (r) for the condition and the cost for the prefix_min.\n\n        w. But wait: the condition A for a voucher in group d (with duration d) is matched against group s (with duration x-d). The condition is: the voucher from group s must have start >= (current voucher's end + 1). The current voucher's end is r_i (which is computed as r_i = l_i + d - 1). But wait: the duration is d, so r_i = l_i + d - 1.\n\n            Actually, the input gives (l_i, r_i, cost_i) and we know that the duration is d = r_i - l_i + 1.\n\n            So yes, we have the duration d and the voucher has duration d.\n\n        x. Now, we must consider: what if d is not in the groups? Then we skip.\n\n        y. Steps:\n\n            groups = defaultdict(list)\n            for i in range(n):\n                read l, r, cost\n                d = r - l + 1\n                groups[d].append((l, r, cost))\n\n            Then, for each d in groups, if d <= x-d (and x-d is positive) then we build the two structures for d.\n\n            But note: we need to build the structures for all d that appear, because we might need to use them as the complementary group (x-d). However, we don't know if x-d exists until we process.\n\n            Alternatively, we can build the structures for every d that appears, and then when processing d from 1 to x//2, we check if the complementary group exists.\n\n            However, we must avoid building structures for d that are greater than x? Actually, d = r-l+1, and r and l are at most 200000, so d is at most 200000. But x is at most 200000, so we only consider d from 1 to 200000.\n\n            But note: the condition for processing is d <= x-d and d <= x (since x-d must be positive, so d < x). Actually, if d > x, then x-d is negative, so we skip. But our d is from 1 to 200000, and x is from 2 to 200000, so if d > x, then x-d is negative and we don't have negative durations. So we only consider d <= x//2.\n\n            Actually, we are iterating d from 1 to floor(x/2). So we only consider d in [1, floor(x/2)].\n\n            But note: it is possible that d is greater than x? Then we skip. But since d = r-l+1 and r<=200000, d<=200000, and x<=200000, so d might be greater than x. Then we don't process that d.\n\n            However, we must build the structures for every d that appears (even if d > x//2) because it might be used as the complementary group (if d <= x, then x-d might be positive). But wait: if d > x, then x-d is negative, so we don't process. But if d <= x, then we might process d (if d <= x-d) or d might be the complementary of some other group (if d <= x-d) and then we process the pair (d, x-d) when d <= x-d.\n\n            Actually, the condition for processing the pair (d, x-d) is d <= x-d, which is equivalent to 2*d <= x. So d <= x//2.\n\n            Therefore, we only need to build the structures for d that are <= x//2? Not exactly: we need to build the structures for d that are <= x//2 because we are going to use them as the first part (d) and then the complementary group (x-d) might be larger. But also, we need to build the structures for d that are in the range [1, x//2] and also for d that are greater than x//2? \n\n            Actually, no: because when d is greater than x//2, then x-d < d, and then we would have processed the pair (x-d, d) when d' = x-d (which is <= x//2). So we don't need to build the structure for d if d > x//2? \n\n            But wait: if d is greater than x//2, then we don't process the pair (d, x-d) because d > x-d. And if we don't build the structure for d, then when processing d'=x-d (which is <= x//2) we would need the structure for d (which is x-d'=d). \n\n            Therefore, we must build the structures for every d that appears (even if d > x//2) because it might be the complementary of a smaller d.\n\n            However, note: we are iterating d from 1 to x//2. Then for each d, we check if x-d exists. But the complementary group x-d might be a duration that is not in the groups, then we skip.\n\n            But we need the structure for group (x-d) even if x-d is not in the groups? Then we skip the pair.\n\n            So we must build the structures for every duration that appears, regardless of being <= x//2 or not.\n\n            However, we can do:\n\n                For d in groups (all durations that appear), we build the two structures.\n\n            Then, when iterating d from 1 to x//2 (only for d that are keys in groups and d <= x-d and x-d is also a key in groups) we process.\n\n            But wait: we don't know the complementary group until we check. So we must have built the structure for x-d.\n\n            Therefore, we build the structures for every duration that appears.\n\n        z. Steps summary:\n\n            Step 1: Read n, x and the n lines.\n\n            Step 2: Group the vouchers by duration d = r-l+1.\n\n            Step 3: For each duration d that appears in the groups (regardless of d's value relative to x), build:\n\n                struct_A[d] = build_A_struct(vouchers)   # (arr_l, suffix_min)\n                struct_B[d] = build_B_struct(vouchers)   # (arr_r, prefix_min)\n\n            Step 4: Initialize ans = a big number (like 10**18)\n\n            Step 5: For d in range(1, (x//2)+1):   # d from 1 to floor(x/2)\n\n                s = x - d\n\n                # Check if d and s are in the groups (and d<=s, so we process only once)\n\n                if d == s:\n                    if d in groups:\n                        # Process the same group d\n                        process_same_group(d, groups[d], struct_A[d], struct_B[d], ans)\n                else:\n                    if d in groups and s in groups:\n                        # Process the pair (d, s)\n                        process_pair(d, groups[d], struct_A[d], s, groups[s], struct_B[s], ans)\n\n            Step 6: Also, we must consider: what if x is even and d = x//2 is present? Then we process in the same group case.\n\n            However, note: our loop goes from 1 to x//2 (inclusive). So if x is even, then d = x//2 is included.\n\n            Step 7: Print ans if ans is not the big number, else print -1.\n\n            But wait: what if there are multiple pairs (d, s) and d>s? We are only processing d from 1 to x//2, so we cover all pairs (d, s) with d<=s.\n\n            However, note: the condition for non-overlap is symmetric. But our processing for the same group d==s is independent.\n\n        aa. Now, write the helper functions:\n\n            def process_same_group(d, vouchers, struct_A, struct_B, ans):\n                # struct_A and struct",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires selecting two non-overlapping vouchers where the sum of their durations is exactly `x`. Each voucher is characterized by its start day, end day, and cost. The key insight is to efficiently check pairs of vouchers without resorting to a brute-force approach, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By grouping vouchers by their duration, we can quickly access all vouchers that contribute to a specific part of the required total duration `x`. For each duration `d`, the complementary duration is `x - d`. We then need to find pairs of vouchers (one from duration `d` and one from duration `x - d`) that do not overlap.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Grouping by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to efficiently access all vouchers of a particular duration.\n   - **Preprocessing Structures**: For each duration, we preprocess two structures:\n     - **Structure A**: Sorted by start day (`l`) and a suffix minimum array to quickly find the minimal cost voucher with a start day greater than a given value.\n     - **Structure B**: Sorted by end day (`r`) and a prefix minimum array to quickly find the minimal cost voucher with an end day less than a given value.\n   - **Query Processing**: For each duration `d` (up to `x/2`), we check if its complement `x - d` exists. If it does, we query the structures for both conditions (non-overlap) and update the minimal cost accordingly.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: The solution involves sorting and preprocessing steps for each duration, which is O(n log n) in total. Each query operation is O(log n), and we perform up to O(n) queries, leading to an overall complexity of O(n log n).\n   - **Space Complexity**: We store additional structures for each duration, which in the worst case could be O(n) per duration, but overall remains manageable given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef build_A_struct(vouchers):\n    if not vouchers:\n        return None, None\n    sorted_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    arr_l = [v[0] for v in sorted_vouchers]\n    arr_cost = [v[2] for v in sorted_vouchers]\n    n = len(arr_cost)\n    suffix_min = [0] * n\n    suffix_min[-1] = arr_cost[-1]\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_min[i] = min(arr_cost[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n    return arr_l, suffix_min\n\ndef build_B_struct(vouchers):\n    if not vouchers:\n        return None, None\n    sorted_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    arr_r = [v[1] for v in sorted_vouchers]\n    arr_cost = [v[2] for v in sorted_vouchers]\n    n = len(arr_cost)\n    prefix_min = [0] * n\n    prefix_min[0] = arr_cost[0]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_min[i] = min(arr_cost[i], prefix_min[i-1])\n    return arr_r, prefix_min\n\ndef query_A(arr_l, suffix_min, boundary):\n    if arr_l is None or suffix_min is None:\n        return None\n    pos = bisect.bisect_left(arr_l, boundary)\n    if pos >= len(arr_l):\n        return None\n    return suffix_min[pos]\n\ndef query_B(arr_r, prefix_min, boundary):\n    if arr_r is None or prefix_min is None:\n        return None\n    pos = bisect.bisect_right(arr_r, boundary) - 1\n    if pos < 0:\n        return None\n    return prefix_min[pos]\n\ndef process_same_group(d, vouchers, struct_A, struct_B, ans):\n    if struct_A is None or struct_B is None:\n        return\n    arr_l, suffix_min = struct_A\n    arr_r, prefix_min = struct_B\n    for voucher in vouchers:\n        l_i, r_i, cost_i = voucher\n        candidate1 = query_A(arr_l, suffix_min, r_i + 1)\n        candidate2 = query_B(arr_r, prefix_min, l_i - 1)\n        if candidate1 is not None:\n            total_cost = cost_i + candidate1\n            if total_cost < ans:\n                ans = total_cost\n        if candidate2 is not None:\n            total_cost = cost_i + candidate2\n            if total_cost < ans:\n                ans = total_cost\n\ndef process_pair(d, vouchers_d, struct_A_d, s, vouchers_s, struct_B_s, ans):\n    if struct_A_d is None or struct_B_s is None:\n        return\n    arr_l_s, suffix_min_s = struct_A_d\n    arr_r_s, prefix_min_s = struct_B_s\n    for voucher in vouchers_d:\n        l_i, r_i, cost_i = voucher\n        candidate1 = query_A(arr_l_s, suffix_min_s, r_i + 1)\n        candidate2 = query_B(arr_r_s, prefix_min_s, l_i - 1)\n        if candidate1 is not None:\n            total_cost = cost_i + candidate1\n            if total_cost < ans:\n                ans = total_cost\n        if candidate2 is not None:\n            total_cost = cost_i + candidate2\n            if total_cost < ans:\n                ans = total_cost\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it)); x_val = int(next(it))\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(next(it)); r = int(next(it)); cost = int(next(it))\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost))\n        \n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for (l, r, cost) in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        groups[d].append((l, r, cost))\n        \n    struct_A = {}\n    struct_B = {}\n    \n    for d, vouchers_list in groups.items():\n        struct_A[d] = build_A_struct(vouchers_list)\n        struct_B[d] = build_B_struct(vouchers_list)\n        \n    ans = 10**18\n    \n    for d in range(1, (x_val//2)+1):\n        s = x_val - d\n        if d == s:\n            if d in groups:\n                process_same_group(d, groups[d], struct_A[d], struct_B[d], ans)\n        else:\n            if d in groups and s in groups:\n                process_pair(d, groups[d], struct_A[d], s, groups[s], struct_B[s], ans)\n                \n    if ans == 10**18:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import bisect\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each characterized by start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration (end day - start day + 1). This allows efficient access to vouchers contributing to specific parts of the total duration `x`.\n3. **Preprocessing Structures**: For each duration, two structures are built:\n   - **Structure A**: Sorted by start day with a suffix minimum array to find the cheapest voucher starting after a given day.\n   - **Structure B**: Sorted by end day with a prefix minimum array to find the cheapest voucher ending before a given day.\n4. **Query Processing**: For each duration `d` (up to `x/2`), if its complement `x - d` exists, the solution checks for non-overlapping pairs using the preprocessed structures. The minimal cost is updated whenever a valid pair is found.\n5. **Output**: The minimal cost is printed if valid pairs exist; otherwise, `-1` is printed indicating no solution.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and preprocessing, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
