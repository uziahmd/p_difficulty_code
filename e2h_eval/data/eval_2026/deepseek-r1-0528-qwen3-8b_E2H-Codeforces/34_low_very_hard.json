And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and k.\n Then, read the next line which has n integers.\n\n There are (n - k + 1) weeks. Each week is k consecutive days.\n\n We need to compute the average sleep time over all weeks.\n\n However, note that the total sum of sleep times for all weeks is the sum of:\n   For week starting at i (from 0 to n-k): \n        S_i = a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[i+k-1]\n\n Then, we have (n-k+1) weeks, so the total sum of all weeks is the sum of all S_i.\n\n The average is: (sum_{i=0}^{n-k} S_i) / (n-k+1)\n\n But note: we cannot simply do two nested loops because n and k can be up to 200,000.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n Let T = total sum of the entire array? Not exactly, because each week is k consecutive days.\n\n We can precompute a prefix sum array P such that:\n   P[0] = 0\n   P[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a{i-1}\n\n Then, the sum for the week starting at i is: P[i+k] - P[i]\n\n Then, the total sum of all weeks is: \n   total_sum = sum_{i=0}^{n-k} (P[i+k] - P[i])\n\n And the number of weeks is: m = n - k + 1\n\n So, average = total_sum / m\n\n However, note: we can also express total_sum as:\n   = (P[k] - P[0]) + (P[k+1]-P[1]) + ... + (P[n] - P[k-1])\n   But wait, let's check with indices:\n\n   Actually, the week starting at i uses from index i to i+k-1, so the prefix sum from 0 to n is built on indices 0..n-1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a different way:\n\n   total_sum = (P[k] - P[0]) + (P[k+1]-P[1]) + ... + (P[n] - P[k-1])\n\n   This can be written as:\n        = [P[k] + P[k+1] + ... + P[n]] - [P[0] + P[1] + ... + P[k-1]]\n\n   So if we have the prefix sum array P, then we can compute two parts:\n\n        part1 = sum_{i=k}^{n} P[i]\n        part2 = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} P[i]\n\n   Then total_sum = part1 - part2.\n\n But wait, let's test with example: \"3 2\\n3 4 7\"\n\n   n=3, k=2\n   Array: [3,4,7]\n\n   Build prefix P of length n+1: \n        P[0] = 0\n        P[1] = 3\n        P[2] = 3+4 = 7\n        P[3] = 3+4+7 = 14\n\n   Then, weeks: \n        Week0: from day0 to day1 -> 3+4 = 7 -> P[2]-P[0] = 7-0=7\n        Week1: from day1 to day2 -> 4+7=11 -> P[3]-P[1]=14-3=11\n\n   Total_sum = 7+11 = 18.\n\n   Using the other method:\n        part1 = P[2] + P[3] = 7 + 14 = 21\n        part2 = P[0] + P[1] = 0 + 3 = 3\n        total_sum = 21 - 3 = 18 -> correct.\n\n   Number of weeks = n-k+1 = 3-2+1 = 2\n   Average = 18/2 = 9.0\n\n However, note: the above formula for total_sum is correct.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, k and the list of n integers.\n\n   Step 2: Build a prefix sum array P of length n+1.\n\n        P[0] = 0\n        For i from 1 to n: P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n   Step 3: \n        Let m = n - k + 1   (number of weeks)\n\n        total_sum = (sum of P[i] for i from k to n) - (sum of P[i] for i from 0 to k-1)\n\n        We can compute:\n            part1 = sum(P",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks in a given sequence of days. A week is defined as k consecutive days, and there are (n - k + 1) such weeks in the sequence. The challenge is to compute this efficiently without resorting to a brute-force approach, which would be too slow for large inputs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires calculating the average sleep time over all overlapping windows of size k in an array of length n. Each window's sum must be computed, and then these sums are averaged over all possible windows.\n2. **Intuition**: The key insight is to use a prefix sum array to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. This allows us to efficiently calculate the sum of each window of size k by leveraging the prefix sums.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the original array. This enables quick calculation of the sum of any subarray.\n   - **Sliding Window**: For each window starting at position i, the sum can be derived from the prefix sums as P[i+k] - P[i]. Summing these values for all valid windows gives the total sleep time across all weeks.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Building the prefix sum array: O(n)\n   - Calculating the total sum of all windows: O(n) using the prefix array\n   - Computing the average: O(1)\n   Thus, the overall complexity is O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n        \n    P = [0] * (n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        \n    part1 = sum(P[k:])\n    part2 = sum(P[:k])\n    total_sum = part1 - part2\n    m = n - k + 1\n    \n    if m == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n    else:\n        avg = total_sum / m\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days (n), the length of a week (k), and the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: If k is 0, the result is trivially 0. If there are no valid weeks (m = 0), the result is also 0.\n3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array `P` is constructed such that `P[i]` holds the sum of the first `i` elements of the original array. This allows efficient computation of subarray sums.\n4. **Total Sum Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is computed by subtracting the sum of the first `k` prefix sums from the sum of the remaining prefix sums (from index `k` to `n`).\n5. **Average Calculation**: The average is obtained by dividing the total sum by the number of windows (m). The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages prefix sums to avoid recalculating window sums repeatedly, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
