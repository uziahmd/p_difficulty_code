Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile) with the combined frequency of the first two.\n 3. If the two frequencies match exactly, then we output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that there should be no extra letters and no missing letters.\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n - Concatenate the first two strings to form the target string.\n - Count the frequency of each character in the target string and in the third string.\n - If the counts for every letter in the target string are the same as in the pile (and no other letters in the pile), then it's \"YES\". But note: the pile must not have any letter not present in the target? Actually, if the pile has an extra letter (even if it's one that is in the target but more than needed) then it's NO.\n\n So, we can do:\n   target = s1 + s2\n   pile = s3\n\n Then, we can create two dictionaries or use collections.Counter for both.\n\n Alternatively, we can check:\n   For each char in the target, the count in the pile must be at least the count in the target? But wait, we require exact match.\n\n Actually, we need the multiset of the pile to be exactly the multiset of the target.\n\n So, we can do:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   c_target = Counter(target)\n   c_pile = Counter(pile)\n\n   Then, if c_target == c_pile, then YES, else NO.\n\n But note: what if the pile has a letter not in the target? Then c_pile will have a key that isn't in c_target, and the Counter comparison will fail.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        guest = \"A\"\n        host = \"A\"\n        pile = \"AA\" -> matches\n        pile = \"AB\" -> does not match because 'B' is extra.\n\n This approach will work because the Counter for the target doesn't have 'B', so when comparing, the pile's counter has an extra key.\n\n However, let's test with the example provided:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   Target = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   Pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But wait, let me check the lengths: \n        len(SANTACLAUS) = 10, len(DEDMOROZ)=8 -> total 18.\n        len(SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS) = 18.\n\n   Now, are the letters the same? \n\n   Actually, note: the example input is given as a string with spaces and \\n? The problem says the input file consists of three lines.\n\n   The example input format is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   But actually, the sample input has three lines. Let me break down:\n\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   So, target = \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" (without space) -> 10+8=18 characters.\n\n   Pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" -> 18 characters.\n\n   Let's count the frequency of one letter: \n        'S': target: 2 (from SANTA and CLAUS) + 1 (from DEDMOROZ? no) -> Actually, let's count:\n\n        SANTACLAUS: S appears 2 times (SANTA has two S? Actually, SANTA: S, A, N, T, A -> wait, SANTA: S, A, N, T, A -> so two A's but only one S.\n\n        Actually, let me write:\n\n        Guest: SANTACLAUS -> S:1, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1\n        Host: DEDMOROZ -> D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Combined: \n            S:1, A:2, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. This involves checking if the frequency of each letter in the pile matches exactly with the frequency of each letter in the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to verify if the letters in the pile (third input line) can be rearranged to form the concatenation of the first two input lines (guest's name and host's name). The solution hinges on comparing the frequency of each character in the combined names with the frequency of each character in the pile.\n2. **Intuition**: By using a frequency counter (or dictionary), we can efficiently compare the counts of each character in both strings. If the counts match exactly for all characters, then the pile can be rearranged to form the required names; otherwise, it cannot.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves reading the three input lines, combining the first two into a single string, and then using a counter to tally the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile string. The counters are then compared for equality.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves processing each character in the input strings once, leading to a linear time complexity relative to the total length of the input strings. This is efficient given the constraints (each line length does not exceed 100 characters).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest_name = input().strip()\n    host_name = input().strip()\n    pile_letters = input().strip()\n    \n    target = guest_name + host_name\n    count_target = Counter(target)\n    count_pile = Counter(pile_letters)\n    \n    print(\"YES\" if count_target == count_pile else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines from standard input, stripping any extraneous whitespace or newline characters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The first two lines (guest's name and host's name) are concatenated into a single string called `target`.\n3. **Frequency Counting**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, the code counts the occurrences of each character in both the `target` string and the pile string (`pile_letters`).\n4. **Comparison**: The code checks if the frequency counts of the `target` and `pile_letters` are identical. If they are, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies whether the pile contains exactly the necessary letters to reconstruct the original names, ensuring no extra or missing letters are present.",
