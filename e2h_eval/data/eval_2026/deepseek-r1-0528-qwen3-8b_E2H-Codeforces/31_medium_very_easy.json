Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer from -x to x (excluding 0? Actually including 0? But note: the problem says \"each card\" doesn't exceed x in absolute value, so from -x to x inclusive.\n\n However, note that the set of available cards is infinite for each integer in [-x, x].\n\n Our goal: find the minimum number of cards to add so that the total sum becomes zero.\n\n Steps:\n Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n\n We can choose a set of k cards (each card's value between -x and x) such that the sum of these k cards is -S.\n\n Since we can choose any integer in [-x, x] for each card, we are effectively allowed to choose any integer in that range.\n\n The problem now reduces to: what is the minimum nonnegative integer k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak (each in [-x, x]) satisfying a1+a2+...+ak = -S?\n\n Note: We are allowed to use zeros? Yes, but zeros don't help unless we need to adjust the sign. However, note that we can also use negative and positive numbers arbitrarily.\n\n Observation:\n We want to minimize k, the number of cards.\n\n Since each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or at least -x (if negative), the maximum absolute value we can achieve with k cards is k*x.\n\n However, note that we don't require the entire set to have the same sign. But we can think in terms of:\n\n Let T = -S (the target)\n\n We wish to know: is it possible to represent T as a sum of k numbers, each in [-x, x]?\n\n Conditions for feasibility for a fixed k:\n 1. The absolute value of T must be <= k*x. (Because the maximum positive sum is k*x, and maximum negative is -k*x)\n 2. Additionally, note that if we break down T into k parts, we can adjust by one unit per card? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. This means that we can adjust the total by any amount between -k*x and k*x, but not necessarily every integer in between? Actually, we can achieve every integer in that range because:\n\n Consider: we can use one card to adjust by 1 if x>=1. But wait, if x=1, then we can only use -1,0,1. Then the step is 1. Similarly, if x>=1, then by having multiple cards we can adjust by 1 each time. Actually, we can represent any integer T in the range [-k*x, k*x] if k>=ceil(|T|/x) and we can adjust the total by 1 per card? \n\n But note: we have the freedom to choose any integer in [-x, x] for each card. Therefore, the set of achievable totals is all integers between -k*x and k*x. Why?\n   - Start with 0 (by using k zeros). Then we can change one card by 1 to get ±1, then by another card by 1 again, etc. So we can change the total by any integer in the range.\n\n However, wait: what if x=2? Then we can change by steps of 1, but also by 2. But note: we can also use a combination. Actually, the key is that the set of achievable sums is contiguous from -k*x to k*x. Why?\n   - We can use the fact that the greatest common divisor of the set {1,2,...,x} is 1 (if x>=1) but actually we are allowed to use negative and positive. However, we can use one card to adjust by 1 (if x>=1) then the entire set of achievable sums is all integers between -k*x and k*x.\n\n But wait: what if x=0? Then the only card we can use is 0. Then we can only achieve 0. However, the problem states x>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n Therefore, the condition for T is that |T| <= k*x, and then we can represent T.\n\n However, there is a catch: the problem does not require that we use distinct cards, and we can use zeros. But note: zeros don't change the total. So if we have a target T, we can use zeros to fill up the remaining cards.\n\n But we are minimizing k. We must find the smallest k such that |T| <= k*x.\n\n However, consider: sometimes even if k*x >= |T|, we might be able to use fewer cards by cleverly choosing negative and positive? Actually, the minimal k is at least ceil(|T| / x). Because with k-1 cards, the maximum absolute sum we can get is (k-1)*x, so if |T| > (k-1)*x, then k-1 is not enough.\n\n But wait: we can also mix positive and negative? Actually, the condition is that we can represent T if and only if |T| <= k*x and k*x >= |T|, and note that the step is 1, so we can represent every integer in the interval. Therefore, the minimal k is the smallest integer k such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n However, let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n   Current sum: -1 + 1 + 2 = 2 -> T = -2.\n   We need k such that k*2 >= 2 -> k>=1. So k=1.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n   Current sum: -4 -> T = 4.\n   We need k such that k*3 >= 4 -> k>= ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.33) = 2.\n\n But wait, what if T=0? Then k=0. But note: we already have n cards. If the sum is 0, then we don't need to add any card.\n\n However, there's a twist: the problem says \"minimum number of cards to find\". If the sum is already zero, then we don't need to add any. So k=0.\n\n But note: the example inputs: \n   Example 1: n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> sum=2, so we need k=1.\n   Example 2: n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> sum=-4, so we need k=2.\n\n Therefore, algorithm:\n\n Step 1: Read n and x, then the list of n integers.\n\n Step 2: Compute the current sum S.\n\n Step 3: Let T = -S. If T==0, then answer 0.\n\n Step 4: Otherwise, we need the smallest k (nonnegative integer) such that k*x >= abs(T).\n\n But wait: is that always sufficient? We argued that the set of achievable sums is contiguous from -k*x to k*x. Therefore, if |T| <= k*x, then we can form T.\n\n Therefore, k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n However, note: if |T| is 0, then k_min=0, which is correct.\n\n But let's check with an example where T is negative: T=-5, x=2 -> |T|=5, then k_min = ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. And indeed: with 3 cards, maximum absolute sum is 6, so we can represent -5 (for example, -2-2-1). \n\n However, wait: the example 2: T=4, x=3 -> ceil(4/3)=2, which is correct.\n\n But consider T=3, x=2: ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. With two cards, the maximum absolute sum is 4, and 3 is within [-4,4] and we can represent 3 (for example, 2+1). \n\n However, wait: can we represent 3 with two cards if each card is at most 2? \n   We can use 2 and 1: 2+1=3. But note: the card 1 is allowed because x=2, so 1 is in [-2,2]. \n\n But wait, what if T=1, x=1? Then ceil(1/1)=1, and we can use one card: 1.\n\n What if T=1, x=2? Then ceil(1/2)=1, and we can use one card: 1.\n\n What if T=1, x=3? Then ceil(1/3)=1, same.\n\n However, what if T=2, x=1? Then ceil(2/1)=2, and we can use two cards: 1+1=2.\n\n But what if T=2, x=2? Then ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1, but wait: can we represent 2 with one card? Yes, because 2 is in [-2,2]. So k=1.\n\n So the formula k_min = ceil(|T| / x) is correct.\n\n However, note: the above reasoning assumed that we can represent any integer in the range [-k*x, k*x]. This is true because the set of integers we can choose per card includes consecutive integers (from -x to x) and we can combine them arbitrarily. In particular, we can use the following:\n\n With one card, we can get any integer from -x to x.\n With two cards, we can get any integer from -2x to 2x, because the two cards can be chosen independently. For example, to get 2x, we choose two x's. To get 2x-1, we can choose one card as x and the other as x-1, and so on.\n\n Therefore, the minimal k is indeed ceil(|T| / x).\n\n However, wait: what if T is negative? We use the absolute value, so it doesn't matter.\n\n But note: there is one more constraint: the problem allows only integers from -x to x. The above reasoning holds because we can form any integer between -k*x and k*x.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the entire set to be nonnegative or anything else. We are just adding k cards.\n\n Therefore, code:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   total = sum(arr)\n   T = -total\n\n   if T == 0:\n       print(0)\n   else:\n       # We need the smallest k such that k*x >= abs(T)\n       # k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n       k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x   # This is equivalent to ceiling division for positive numbers.\n\n       # But note: if abs(T) is divisible by x, then ceil(|T|/x) = |T|//x, otherwise |T|//x + 1.\n\n       # Alternatively, we can do: \n       #   k_min = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x\n\n       # However, let's test: \n       #   |T|=4, x=3: (4+3-1)//3 = 6//3 = 2 -> correct.\n       #   |T|=3, x=2: (3+2-1)//2 = 4//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n       print(k_min)\n\n But wait, consider the example: T=5, x=2: \n   (5+2-1)//2 = 6//2 = 3 -> correct.\n\n However, there's a catch: what if T is negative? We took absolute value, so that's okay.\n\n But wait, what if the current sum is negative? Then T is positive. And vice versa. But we are taking absolute value, so it's symmetric.\n\n However, let me check the example: \n   Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\": current sum = -4, T=4 -> |T|=4, then k_min=ceil(4/3)=2.\n\n But wait, the sample output is 2.\n\n Another example: \n   Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\": current sum=2, T=-2, |T|=2, ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1.\n\n It matches.\n\n However, wait: what if we have a fractional part? The ceiling division is correctly computed by (abs(T)+x-1)//x.\n\n But note: integer arithmetic. Since x and abs(T) are integers, we can do:\n\n   k_min = (abs(T) - 1) // x + 1   # This is another way to compute ceiling.\n\n But both methods work.\n\n However, there is one more possibility: what if the current sum is zero? Then T=0, and we already handled that.\n\n But wait: what if the current sum is not zero, but very small? Our formula still holds.\n\n However, let me test with T=1, x=1000: k_min = ceil(1/1000)=1, which is correct.\n\n But wait: is there a case where we can use fewer cards by not using the maximum absolute value? \n\n The condition is necessary and sufficient: we must have k*x >= |T|. And since we can represent every integer in the interval, the minimal k is indeed the ceiling of |T|/x.\n\n However, note: the problem does not restrict the use of zeros. But zeros don't help in increasing the absolute value. So we must use at least ceil(|T|/x) cards.\n\n But wait: consider T=0, then we use 0 cards. Correct.\n\n However, wait: what if we have to use at least one card? The problem says \"minimum number\", so 0 is acceptable.\n\n But note: the problem says \"help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find\", so if the current sum is zero, then 0.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   total = sum(arr)\n   T = -total\n\n   if T == 0:\n       print(0)\n   else:\n       # Compute the absolute value of T\n       absT = abs(T)\n       # Ceiling division: (absT + x - 1) // x\n       k_min = (absT + x - 1) // x\n       print(k_min)\n\n But wait, let me test with T=3, x=2: \n   absT=3, (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n However, wait: what if T=0? We handled that separately.\n\n But wait: what if T is negative? We use absolute value, so that's okay.\n\n However, wait: what if the current sum is negative? Then T is positive. Example: current sum = -10, then T=10. Then k_min = ceil(10/x). Correct.\n\n But wait, there is an alternative scenario: sometimes we might be able to use negative cards to reduce the absolute value? Actually, the problem is symmetric: we can use any integer in [-x,x]. The minimal k is determined by the absolute value.\n\n However, wait: what if we have T=1, x=1? Then k_min=ceil(1/1)=1. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if T=1, x=2? Then ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if T=2, x=1? Then ceil(2/1)=2. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if T=2, x=2? Then ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1. Correct.\n\n However, wait: what if T=3, x=2? Then ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if T=4, x=2? Then ceil(4/2)=2. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if T=5, x=2? Then ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if T=5, x=3? Then ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2. Correct? With two cards, maximum absolute sum is 6, and we can represent 5: for example, 3+2=5. But wait, 3 is allowed because x=3, and 2 is in [-3,3]. So yes.\n\n However, wait: what if T=6, x=3? Then ceil(6/3)=2. But we can also use two cards: 3+3=6. Correct.\n\n But wait: what if T=7, x=3? Then ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3. Correct because 3+3+1=7, and 1 is allowed.\n\n But wait: what if T=7, x=2? Then ceil(7/2)=ceil(3.5)=4. With 4 cards: maximum absolute sum is 8, and 7 is in [ -8,8 ]. How? We can use three 2's and one 1: 2+2+2+1=7. Or two 2's and three 3's? Wait, no: x=2, so the maximum per card is 2. Then we can use: 2+2+2+1 -> but wait, 1 is allowed because x=2 (so from -2 to 2). So 1 is allowed. Then 2+2+2+1=7. So 4 cards.\n\n Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n However, wait: what if T=7, x=2? Then 7/2=3.5 -> ceil to 4. Correct.\n\n But note: the above reasoning relies on the fact that we can use any integer in [-x, x]. This includes negative numbers as well. So we can also use negative numbers to adjust the total? \n\n Actually, we are free to mix positive and negative. But note: our goal is to achieve T (which is positive in this example). Why would we use negative numbers? \n\n Example: T=7, x=2, and we have to use 4 cards. We could use four 2's: 8, which is too big. Then we need to subtract 1. But we cannot use a negative card to subtract 1? Actually, we can use three 2's and one 1: that gives 7. Alternatively, we can use two 2's, one 2, and one 1? That doesn't matter. The point is: we can use positive numbers to get the desired positive total, and negative numbers would only be used if we overshoot and then correct by negative? But wait, in the example T=7, we are going for positive. \n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the cards we add are of the same sign. But the minimal k is determined by the absolute value. \n\n But wait: is it possible that by using negative cards we can achieve T with fewer than ceil(|T|/x) cards? \n\n Consider: T=5, x=3. \n   Without negative cards: we can use two cards: 3+2=5 (if we allow 2, which we do). But wait, 2 is less than 3, so that's allowed. But if we try to use negative cards, why would we? The goal is to get 5, so negatives would make it harder.\n\n However, consider T=3, x=3. \n   Without negative: one card: 3. With negative: we might use two cards: 4 and -1, but wait: 4 is not allowed because x=3. So no.\n\n Now, consider T=3, x=2: \n   Without negative: two cards: 2+1=3. \n   With negative: we could use three cards: 2+2-1=3. But that requires 3 cards, which is worse.\n\n Therefore, we don't need to consider negative cards for achieving a positive T, because we can use positive cards to build up to T.\n\n But wait: what if T is negative? Then we can use negative cards. The absolute value makes it symmetric.\n\n Therefore, the minimal k is ceil(|T|/x).\n\n However, wait: what if T is negative? Example: T=-5, x=2. Then |T|=5, k_min=ceil(5/2)=3. We can use three cards: -2, -2, -1. Or -2, -1, -2. Or even two cards: -2 and -3? But wait, x=2, so -3 is not allowed. So we must use three cards.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   total = sum(arr)\n   T = -total\n\n   if T == 0:\n       print(0)\n   else:\n       absT = abs(T)\n       # Ceiling division: (absT + x - 1) // x\n       k_min = (absT + x - 1) // x\n       print(k_min)\n\n But wait, wait, wait! There is a catch: the above reasoning assumes that we can achieve the target T with k_min cards. However, note that the problem does not require that the additional cards are distinct or that we cannot use zeros. \n\n However, what if T is 0? We already handled.\n\n But wait, consider the following: what if the current sum is not zero, but we can use a combination of positive and negative to adjust the total by T? \n\n Actually, the above reasoning is about the absolute value. But note: the problem allows both positive and negative. However, the minimal k is determined by the absolute value requirement.\n\n But wait: is there a possibility that we can use fewer cards by mixing positive and negative? \n\n Example: T=1, x=2. \n   We need to form 1. With one card: we can use 1. So k_min=1.\n\n Example: T=3, x=2. \n   With two cards: 2+1=3. k_min=2.\n\n Example: T=4, x=2. \n   With two cards: 2+2=4. k_min=2.\n\n Example: T=5, x=2. \n   With two cards: maximum is 4 (2+2). So we need three cards: 2+2+1=5. k_min=3.\n\n Example: T=7, x=2: 2+2+2+1=7 -> 4 cards.\n\n But wait, what if we use negative cards for T=5, x=2? \n   We can use two cards: 3 and 2, but 3 is not allowed (x=2). \n   Or 4 and 1: 4 is not allowed. \n   Or 3 and 2: not allowed. \n\n   Alternatively, with two cards: maximum is 4, so we cannot get 5 with two cards. \n\n   With three cards: maximum is 6, so we can get 5. \n\n   But note: we can also use negative cards: \n        3+1+1 -> but 3 not allowed.\n        2+2+1 -> allowed.\n\n   So no benefit from negatives in this case.\n\n However, consider T=0, but we are not in that case.\n\n Another example: T=2, x=3. \n   Without negatives: one card: 2 -> allowed. So k_min=1.\n\n   But wait: what if we use two cards: 3 and -1? Then 3-1=2. But that uses two cards, which is more than one. So no benefit.\n\n Therefore, the minimal k is the ceiling of |T|/x.\n\n But wait, wait: consider T=4, x=3. \n   Without negatives: two cards: 3+1=4 -> k_min=2.\n   With negatives: two cards: 3+1=4, same.\n\n   But what if T=2, x=3? \n      Without negatives: one card: 2 -> k_min=1.\n      With negatives: two cards: 3-1=2, but that's two cards, so worse.\n\n Therefore, the minimal k is independent of the sign and the ability to mix positive and negative, because we are only concerned with the absolute value and the maximum absolute value we can achieve per card.\n\n However, wait: there is a known issue with the above reasoning: the problem does not require that the cards we add are nonnegative. But the minimal k is determined by the absolute value. \n\n But wait: what if we have a target T=1, and x=1000. Then we can use one card: 1. Correct.\n\n But what if T=0? We handled.\n\n However, wait: what if T=1, and x=0? The problem states x>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says that the initial set had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So the available numbers are from -x to x, inclusive.\n\n One more test: \n   Example: n=1, x=1, card=[1] -> total=1, T=-1. Then k_min = ceil(1/1)=1. Correct.\n\n   Example: n=1, x=1, card=[0] -> total=0, T=0 -> 0. Correct.\n\n   Example: n=1, x=1, card=[-1] -> total=-1, T=1 -> ceil(1/1)=1. Correct.\n\n   Example: n=2, x=1, cards=[1,1] -> total=2, T=-2 -> ceil(2/1)=2. Correct.\n\n   Example: n=2, x=1, cards=[1,-1] -> total=0 -> 0. Correct.\n\n   Example: n=3, x=1, cards=[1,1,1] -> total=3, T=-3 -> ceil(3/1)=3. Correct.\n\n   Example: n=3, x=1, cards=[1,0,-1] -> total=0 -> 0. Correct.\n\n   Example: n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> total=2, T=-2 -> ceil(2/2)=1. Correct.\n\n   Example: n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> total=-4, T=4 -> ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2. Correct.\n\n Therefore, we output the code accordingly.\n\n However, wait: the example input format: \n      Input: ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n We read the first line: two integers, then the second line: n integers.\n\n But note: the example input has two lines: the first line is \"3 2\", the second line is \"-1 1 2\".\n\n So we read:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n But wait: the first line has two integers: n and x. The second line has n integers.\n\n However, the problem says: \n      The first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card.\n      The second line contains n space-separated integers.\n\n So our reading is correct.\n\n Let me run the provided examples:\n\n Example 1: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n      n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2]\n      total = -1+1+2 = 2, T=-2 -> absT=2, k_min=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (in integer floor division, 3//2=1) -> prints 1.\n\n Example 2:\n      Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n      n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2]\n      total=-4, T=4, absT=4, k_min=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> prints 2.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   t = -s\n   if t == 0:\n       print(0)\n   else:\n       abs_t = abs(t)\n       # Ceiling division: (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n       k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n       print(k)\n\n However, wait: what if the absolute value of t is 0? Then t=0, and we handled.\n\n But wait: what if x is 0? The problem states x>=1, so no.\n\n We are done.\n\n But wait: I just saw the note in the problem: \n      \"You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x.\"\n\n And we are only constrained by the absolute value.\n\n However, there is one more thing: the problem says the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value. But the additional cards we choose can be any integer from -x to x.\n\n So the above solution is correct.\n\n Let me submit the code.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"minimum number of cards does he need to find\". We are computing the minimal k.\n\n However, wait: is it possible that we can use fewer than ceil(|T|/x) cards by using a combination that doesn't require the total to be built solely by positive numbers? \n\n Example: T=3, x=2. \n   Without negatives: two cards: 2+1=3 -> 2 cards.\n   With negatives: one card: 3 is not allowed (since x=2, so maximum is 2). Two cards: 3 is the same as above. Three cards: 2+2-1=3 -> three cards. So no.\n\n Example: T=4, x=3. \n   Without negatives: two cards: 3+1=4 -> two cards.\n   With negatives: two cards: 3+1=4, same.\n\n Example: T=5, x=3. \n   Without negatives: two cards: 3+2=5 -> two cards.\n   With negatives: two cards: 3+2=5, same.\n\n Example: T=6, x=3. \n   Without negatives: two cards: 3+3=6 -> two cards.\n\n Example: T=7, x=3. \n   Without negatives: three cards: 3+3+1=7 -> three cards.\n   With negatives: three cards: 3+3+1=7, same.\n\n Example: T=7, x=2. \n   Without negatives: four cards: 2+2+2+1=7 -> four cards.\n   With negatives: four cards: 2+2+2+1=7, same.\n\n So it seems that negatives don't help to reduce the number of cards. In fact, they might even increase the required number of cards.\n\n Therefore, the minimal k is indeed ceil(|T|/x).\n\n Final code:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   t = -s\n   if t == 0:\n       print(0)\n   else:\n       abs_t = abs(t)\n       k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n       print(k)\n\n However, wait: what if the absolute value is negative? No, we take absolute value.\n\n But wait: the variable t is negative when the sum is positive, and positive when the sum is negative. But we take absolute value.\n\n But wait: the ceiling division: (abs_t + x - 1) // x is correct for positive integers.\n\n However, note: integer division in Python for positive numbers is floor division. And (a + b - 1) // b is the standard way to compute the ceiling of a/b for positive integers.\n\n But note: if abs_t is 0, then (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x, which is 0 (if x>=1). But we have an if for t==0, so we avoid that.\n\n But wait: what if t is negative? Then abs_t is positive.\n\n Therefore, we are safe.\n\n However, note: the problem says the numbers on the found cards do not exceed x in absolute value, but we are summing them. The absolute value of the sum can be larger than x, but that's okay.\n\n We'll run the code with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n      Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> output 1.\n\n Example 2:\n      Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> output 2.\n\n But wait: the example input string is given as: \n      ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n So we are reading from stdin.\n\n We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"The second line contains n space-separated integers\". We are reading the second line and splitting. This will work.\n\n But wait: what if the input has extra spaces? The problem says \"space-separated\", so we assume no extra spaces.\n\n Therefore, the code is as follows.\n\n But wait, wait: the example input format is exactly as described.\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n However, note: the problem says the first line has two integers, and the second line has n integers. So we are reading correctly.\n\n We'll submit.\n\n But wait: there is an alternative solution that considers that we might be able to use the existing cards to cancel out some of the needed adjustment? \n\n Actually, no: the problem says we can only use the additional cards (with numbers from -x to x). The existing cards are fixed and we cannot change them. We are only adding cards.\n\n Therefore, the above solution is correct.\n\n However, wait: I just thought of something. What if the current sum is not zero, but we can use one or more of the existing cards to help cancel out the need for some of the added cards? \n\n Let me re-read the problem: \n      \"Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?\"\n\n The problem does not say that we can remove cards. We are only adding cards. The existing n cards are fixed and we cannot change them. We are allowed to choose any set of additional cards (each from -x to x) to add to the existing set so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Therefore, we are only concerned with the total sum of the existing cards, and we need to add a set of cards that sum to -total.\n\n So the above solution is correct.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"minimum number of cards to find\", meaning the additional ones.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, x = map(int, input().split())\n   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(arr)\n   t = -s\n   if t == 0:\n       print(0)\n   else:\n       abs_t = abs(t)\n       k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n       print(k)\n\n Let me test with an example that the ceiling division works for edge cases.\n\n   abs_t=0: handled by the if.\n   abs_t=1, x=1 -> (1+1-1)//1 = 1//1=1 -> correct.\n   abs_t=1, x=2 -> (1+2-1)//2 = 2//2=1 -> correct.\n   abs_t=2, x=1 -> (2+1-1)//1=2//1=2 -> correct.\n   abs_t=2, x=2 -> (2+2-1)//2=3//2=1 (in integer floor division, 3//2=1) -> correct.\n\n   abs_t=3, x=2 -> (3+2-1)//2=4//2=2 -> correct.\n\n   abs_t=4, x=3 -> (4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 -> correct.\n\n   abs_t=5, x=3 -> (5+3-1)//3=7//3=2 (because 7//3 in integer floor is 2) -> but wait, ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2, so correct.\n\n   abs_t=6, x=3 -> (6+3-1)//3=8//3=2 (but 8//3 is 2 in floor, but ceil(6/3)=2, so correct.\n\n   abs_t=7, x=3 -> (7+3-1)//3=9//3=3 -> correct.\n\n   abs_t=8, x=3 -> (8+3-1)//3=10//3=3 (because 10//3=3) -> ceil(8/3)=ceil(2.66)=3, correct.\n\n   abs_t=9, x=3 -> (9+3-1)//3=11//3=3 (because 11//3=3) -> but ceil(9/",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards equals zero. Each additional card can have any integer value between -x and x (inclusive), where x is given as part of the input.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the existing cards must be balanced by the sum of the additional cards. If the current sum of the found cards is `S`, then the sum of the additional cards must be `-S` to make the total sum zero.\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards required to achieve a sum of `-S` is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of `S` divided by `x`. This is because each card can contribute at most `x` (in absolute value) towards balancing the sum. For example, if `S` is 5 and `x` is 3, we need at least two cards (since `3*2 = 6` which is greater than or equal to 5).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the current sum `S` of the found cards. If `S` is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, compute the absolute value of `S` and use ceiling division to find the minimal number of cards required. Ceiling division is performed by `(abs(S) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal = sum(arr)\nt = -total\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card). The second line reads the list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum for the additional cards is the negative of this sum (`-total`).\n3. **Check for Zero Sum**: If the target sum is zero, it means no additional cards are needed, so the answer is `0`.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: For non-zero target sums, the absolute value of the target is used to determine the minimal number of cards via ceiling division. This ensures that the sum of the additional cards can exactly (or exceed) the required value, leveraging the maximum contribution per card (`x`).\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the computed minimal number of additional cards.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the solution by focusing on the necessary mathematical operations and ensuring optimal performance with a constant-time complexity for the calculations after reading the input.",
