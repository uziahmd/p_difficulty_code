The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (losses) for both players.\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Instead, we note:\n   - Each player uses a cyclic sequence.\n   - The game has n rounds, and in each round i, we compare A[i] and B[i].\n\n How to index the sequences?\n   Let m = len(A), k = len(B)\n   For round j (0-indexed), \n        Nikephoros uses A[(j * m) // n]? Actually, wait: we have n rounds, but we only need to consider the first LCM(m,k)*? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, we can break the n rounds into complete cycles of the two sequences. But note: the two sequences cycle independently.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the entire game is determined by the relative cycles. However, note that the two sequences have different lengths.\n\n We can think of it as having a state (i, j) for the current positions in A and B. But n is too large.\n\n Another idea: \n   We can precompute the outcomes for one full cycle of both sequences. But note: the two sequences cycle independently and we have n rounds.\n\n Observation:\n   In the first min(m, k) rounds, we can simulate the outcomes? But wait, the sequences are independent and the rounds go from 0 to n-1.\n\n However, we can use the following:\n\n   For a given round t (0-indexed from 0 to n-1):\n        a_index = (t * m) % m   [Wait: no, actually we are taking the t-th element of A, which is at position (t mod m) in A?]\n        Similarly, for B: b_index = (t * k) % k\n\n But wait, let me clarify: \n        In the problem, the sequences are shown in order and then cycle. So the t-th round (0-indexed) uses the element at position (t mod m) in A and (t mod k) in B.\n\n Then, we have n rounds. We want to count:\n   For each round t, if the outcome is a win for Nikephoros (then Polycarpus loses, so we add one to Polycarpus's red spots) or vice versa.\n\n But note: the problem says:\n        If the round finished in a draw, nothing happens.\n        Otherwise, the loser gets a red spot.\n\n So, we are to count the total losses (each loss gives one red spot).\n\n Steps:\n\n   We cannot iterate over n rounds (n up to 2e9). We need to count without iterating.\n\n   Let F(t) be the outcome of round t. We can define a function that returns:\n        'draw' if A[t mod m] == B[t mod k]\n        Otherwise, determine who wins.\n\n   The rules:\n        Rock beats Scissors -> R vs S: R wins, so S loses.\n        Scissors beats Paper -> S vs P: S wins, so P loses.\n        Paper beats Rock -> P vs R: P wins, so R loses.\n\n   Therefore, for a given round t:\n        Let x = A[t % m], y = B[t % k]\n\n        if x == y: draw -> no red spot.\n        else:\n            if (x, y) is (R,S) or (S,P) or (P,R): then x wins, so y loses -> Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n            else: (y wins) -> Nikephoros gets a red spot.\n\n   We need to count for t from 0 to n-1:\n        Let L1 = number of rounds where Polycarpus gets a red spot (i.e., when the outcome is a win for Nikephoros)\n        Let L2 = number of rounds where Nikephoros gets a red spot (i.e., when the outcome is a win for Polycarpus)\n\n   Then output: L2 (for Nikephoros) and L1 (for Polycarpus) ?\n\n   Wait, note: \n        When (x,y) is (R,S): then x=R (Nikephoros) wins, so Polycarpus (y=S) loses -> so that's one for Polycarpus's red spot.\n        When (x,y) is (S,P): then x=S wins, so Polycarpus loses again.\n        When (x,y) is (P,R): then x=P wins, so Polycarpus loses.\n\n        Conversely, when (x,y) is (S,R), (P,S), (R,P): then Nikephoros loses.\n\n   So indeed:\n        If (x,y) is one of: [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> Polycarpus loses (so we count for Polycarpus: +1)\n        Else if (x,y) is one of: [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')] -> wait, let's list all non-draws:\n\n        All possibilities (excluding draw):\n\n        (R,S): Nikephoros wins -> Polycarpus loses.\n        (R,P): Nikephoros loses (because P beats R) -> so (R,P) is a loss for Nikephoros.\n        (S,R): Nikephoros loses (because R beats S).\n        (S,P): Nikephoros wins.\n        (P,R): Nikephoros wins.\n        (P,S): Nikephoros loses (because S beats P).\n\n        Actually, the winning conditions for Nikephoros (x) are:\n            (R,S), (S,P), (P,R)\n\n        The winning conditions for Polycarpus (y) are:\n            (S,R), (P,S), (R,P)\n\n   So, we can define:\n\n        def outcome(x, y):\n            if x == y:\n                return 0   # draw\n            elif (x, y) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                return 1   # Polycarpus loses (so one red spot for Polycarpus)\n            else:\n                return -1  # Nikephoros loses (so one red spot for Nikephoros)\n\n   But wait, we don't need to return 0,1,-1, we just need to count.\n\n   Alternatively, we can count:\n\n        Let f(t) = \n           1 if (A[t%m], B[t%k]) is one of the three winning combinations for Nikephoros? No, wait: in the above, the winning condition for Nikephoros gives a red spot for Polycarpus.\n\n        Actually, we defined:\n            outcome=1 means Polycarpus loses (so we add 1 to Polycarpus's count)\n            outcome=-1 means Nikephoros loses (so we add 1 to Nikephoros's count)\n\n        But wait, in the problem, the red spot goes to the loser. So:\n\n            If outcome is 1 (Nikephoros wins) -> loser is Polycarpus -> add 1 to Polycarpus.\n            If outcome is -1 (Polycarpus wins) -> loser is Nikephoros -> add 1 to Nikephoros.\n\n   However, the problem asks: \"Print two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\"\n\n   Therefore, we want:\n        Nikephoros_red_spots = count of rounds where outcome=-1 (i.e., Polycarpus wins)\n        Polycarpus_red_spots = count of rounds where outcome=1 (i.e., Nikephoros wins)\n\n   But note: there are also draws (outcome=0) which do nothing.\n\n   Now, how to count for n rounds without iterating?\n\n   We note that the pattern of (A[t%m], B[t%k]) repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds? Actually, the pair (t mod m, t mod k) repeats with period LCM(m,k). \n\n   Why? Because the combined cycle is the least common multiple of m and k.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Let T = LCM(m, k)   [the period]\n\n        Then, we can precompute the outcomes for the first T rounds (from t=0 to T-1) and then the entire n rounds can be broken into:\n\n            full_cycles = n // T\n            remainder = n % T\n\n        Then, total counts for the entire n rounds would be:\n\n            total_Nikephoros_red = full_cycles * (count of -1 in one period) + (count of -1 in the first remainder rounds)\n            total_Polycarpus_red = full_cycles * (count of 1 in one period) + (count of 1 in the first remainder rounds)\n\n        However, wait: in one period T, we have T rounds. And we can compute:\n\n            count_win_polycarpus = number of rounds in [0, T-1] where outcome(t) = 1\n            count_win_nikephoros = number of rounds in [0, T-1] where outcome(t) = -1\n\n        Then, for the remainder, we just simulate the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\n   But note: the period T might be very large? Actually, m, k <= 1000, so T = LCM(m,k) <= 1000*1000 = 1e6, which is acceptable because we can precompute the period.\n\n   However, worst-case m and k are 1000, then T could be 1000*1000 / gcd(1000,1000) = 1000, so actually worst-case LCM is 1000*1000 / gcd(1000,1000) = 1000. But wait, if m=1000 and k=1000, then LCM=1000. However, if m=500 and k=1000, then LCM=1000. Actually, the maximum LCM of two numbers <=1000 is about 1000*1000/gcd(1000,1000)=1000, but wait: no, the LCM of 997 and 998 (two primes) is 997*998, which is around 10^6, which is acceptable because 10^6 is acceptable to iterate.\n\n   However, worst-case m=1000, k=1000, then T=1000 (if they are the same, then LCM=1000). Actually, worst-case for two numbers in [1,1000] is when they are coprime: then LCM = m*k. The maximum m*k is 1000*1000 = 1000000, which is 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n   So plan:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, then string A, then string B.\n        Step 2: Compute T = LCM(len(A), len(B)) = (len(A)*len(B)) // gcd(len(A), len(B))\n\n        Step 3: Precompute an array `outcomes` for t from 0 to T-1 (each t we compute the outcome as described) and then count:\n                count1 = count of 1 in outcomes   [for Polycarpus]\n                count_minus1 = count of -1 in outcomes [for Nikephoros]\n\n        Step 4: Compute full_cycles = n // T\n                remainder = n % T\n\n        Step 5: Count the outcomes for the first 'remainder' rounds (t from 0 to remainder-1) separately.\n\n        Step 6: Then:\n                nike_red = full_cycles * count_minus1 + (count_minus1_in_remainder)\n                poly_red = full_cycles * count1 + (count1_in_remainder)\n\n        But note: we already computed the entire period, so we can simply:\n\n                total_nike_red = full_cycles * count_minus1 + (count_minus1_remainder)\n                total_poly_red = full_cycles * count1 + (count1_remainder)\n\n        However, we can avoid storing the entire period by computing the counts in the period and then in the remainder, but we have to simulate the remainder anyway.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Precomputation for the period: we simulate t=0 to T-1 and store the outcome for each t (but we don't need to store the entire array, just the counts).\n\n        Actually, we don't need the entire array, we can compute:\n\n                period_count1 = 0\n                period_count_minus1 = 0\n                for t in range(T):\n                    # get the current elements: \n                    a_char = A[t % len(A)]\n                    b_char = B[t % len(B)]\n                    if a_char == b_char:\n                        continue\n                    elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                        period_count1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        period_count_minus1 += 1\n\n        Then, for the remainder part, we do:\n\n                rem_count1 = 0\n                rem_count_minus1 = 0\n                for t in range(remainder):\n                    a_char = A[t % len(A)]\n                    b_char = B[t % len(B)]\n                    if a_char == b_char:\n                        continue\n                    elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                        rem_count1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        rem_count_minus1 += 1\n\n        Then:\n                nike_red = full_cycles * period_count_minus1 + rem_count_minus1\n                poly_red = full_cycles * period_count1 + rem_count1\n\n        However, note: the remainder part must be simulated separately because the period T is the LCM, and the remainder is less than T.\n\n        But wait: the remainder part is just the first 'remainder' rounds. We can compute it by iterating from t=0 to remainder-1.\n\n        Since remainder < T, and T can be up to 1e6, and n can be up to 2e9, but the remainder is at most T-1 (which is <= 1e6) so it's acceptable.\n\n        However, note: T is the LCM, which is at most 1e6, so the remainder is at most 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: what if n is 2e9 and T is 1e6, then full_cycles is 2000, and we are doing a loop for T (1e6) and then a loop for remainder (which is <1e6). This is acceptable.\n\n   However, there is a catch: the LCM calculation. We need to compute the GCD of m and k.\n\n   Let m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n   We can compute:\n\n        T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n   But note: m and k are at most 1000, so we can compute gcd easily.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            if b == 0:\n                return a\n            return gcd(b, a % b)\n\n        Then T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n   However, we must be cautious: if m or k is zero? The problem states m,k>=1.\n\n   Steps in code:\n\n        import math   (but note: we can write our own gcd if we don't want to import, but the problem says to include necessary imports. Alternatively, we can use math.gcd)\n\n        But the problem says: \"You can consider that the boys had no red spots on them.\" and the input constraints.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            T = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n\n   However, note: the modulus operations for the remainder part: we are using t % len(A) and t % len(B). But in the remainder part, t goes from 0 to remainder-1, and remainder < T. Since T is the LCM, then t < T, so t % m and t % k are just t mod m and t mod k. But wait, is that true? Yes, because T is the LCM, so the pairs (t mod m, t mod k) for t in [0, T-1] cover all residues modulo (m,k) exactly once.\n\n   But note: the period T is the least common multiple, so the sequence of pairs (t mod m, t mod k) has period T.\n\n   However, we don't need to worry because we are iterating t from 0 to T-1 and then from 0 to remainder-1, and remainder < T.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Example from the sample:\n\n        Input: \n            n = 7\n            A = \"RPS\"\n            B = \"RSPP\"\n\n        m = 3, k = 4 -> T = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n        Then, we break 7 rounds: full_cycles = 0, remainder = 7.\n\n        Then we simulate t=0 to 6:\n\n        t=0: A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw.\n        t=1: A[1]='P', B[1]='S' -> (P,S): this is one of the losing conditions for Polycarpus? \n            Check: (P,S): P vs S -> S beats P? Actually, the rule: scissors beats paper. So (P,S) is a win for S (Polycarpus) and loss for P (Nikephoros). \n            According to our condition: \n                Condition for Polycarpus win: (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n                Here, a_char='P', b_char='S' -> not in the list. Then it's the else: which is the other three: \n                The else covers: (S,R), (P,S), (R,P) -> yes, (P,S) is in the else. So we mark as -1 (Nikephoros loses).\n\n        But wait, the example says: \n            Round 1: R-R -> draw.\n            Round 2: P-S -> Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus wins). \n\n        However, our condition for Polycarpus win is [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. \n        In round2: (P,S) is not in that list, so we said it's a loss for Nikephoros. That matches.\n\n        But wait: in our condition, we said:\n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then Polycarpus loses (so we count 1 for Polycarpus's red spots).\n\n        However, in round2, the outcome should be: Polycarpus wins (so we should count 1 for Polycarpus) and that is the opposite.\n\n        There is a confusion in the condition: \n\n            We defined:\n                if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    then outcome = 1   (meaning Polycarpus loses, i.e., we count 1 for Polycarpus's red spot)\n\n            But in round2: (P,S) is NOT in that list, so we went to the else and set outcome=-1 (meaning Nikephoros loses, i.e., we count 1 for Nikephoros's red spot). \n\n            However, the example says: \"P - S. Nikephoros loses\" -> so that is correct: we count 1 for Nikephoros.\n\n        Now, round3: t=2: A[2]='S', B[2]='P' -> (S,P): check condition: \n            [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> ('S','P') is in the list, so outcome=1 (Polycarpus loses) -> meaning we count 1 for Polycarpus.\n\n        Example says: \"S - P. Polycarpus loses\" -> so that is correct.\n\n        So our condition is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the example:\n\n            n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n            We simulate t=0 to 6:\n\n            t0: R,R -> draw -> (0,0)\n            t1: P,S -> else: outcome=-1 -> count_minus1 +=1\n            t2: S,P -> in the list: outcome=1 -> count1 +=1\n            t3: R,P -> (R,P) in the list: outcome=1 -> count1 +=1\n            t4: P,R -> (P,R) in the list: outcome=1 -> count1 +=1\n            t5: S,S -> draw\n            t6: R,P -> (R,P) in the list: outcome=1 -> count1 +=1\n\n            So for the first 7 rounds, we have:\n                count1 = 4\n                count_minus1 = 1\n\n            Then, the example says: \n                Nikephoros has 3 losses (so 3 red spots) and Polycarpus has 2.\n\n            But according to our counts:\n                Nikephoros_red_spots = count_minus1 (which is 1) -> but the example says 3.\n\n            Wait, wait! What's happening?\n\n            Let me recount the example:\n\n                Round 1: R-R -> draw.\n                Round 2: P-S -> Nikephoros loses (so 1 for Nikephoros)\n                Round 3: S-P -> Polycarpus loses (so 1 for Polycarpus)\n                Round 4: R-P -> Nikephoros loses (so 2 for Nikephoros)\n                Round 5: P-R -> Polycarpus loses (so 2 for Polycarpus)\n                Round 6: S-S -> draw.\n                Round 7: R-P -> Nikephoros loses (so 3 for Nikephoros)\n\n            Therefore, the counts should be:\n                Nikephoros: 3\n                Polycarpus: 2\n\n            But our condition:\n\n                We defined:\n                    outcome=1 (Polycarpus loses) -> so that's a red spot for Polycarpus? NO! \n\n            Wait, no: \n\n                Our condition: \n                    if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                        outcome = 1   -> meaning: Polycarpus loses (so we add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots)\n\n                But in round2: (P,S) -> not in the list -> outcome=-1 (meaning Nikephoros loses -> add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots)\n\n                In round3: (S,P) -> in the list -> outcome=1 (meaning Polycarpus loses -> add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots)\n\n                In round4: (R,P) -> in the list -> outcome=1 (add 1 to Polycarpus) -> but wait, round4: \n                    Round4: A[3] = R (since A=\"RPS\": index3: 3%3=0 -> 'R'), B[3]=B[3%4]=B[3]='P'\n                    (R,P): R vs P -> P beats R, so Nikephoros (R) loses, so Polycarpus wins -> so we should add 1 to Polycarpus? \n\n                But wait: our condition says (R,P) is in the list [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> no, wait: \n                    The list: \n                        ('R','S') -> R beats S: yes, then (R,S) is a win for R (Nikephoros) -> so Polycarpus loses (correct).\n                        ('S','P') -> S beats P: correct.\n                        ('P','R') -> P beats R: correct.\n\n                But (R,P) is not in the list! \n\n                Our list does not contain (R,P). \n\n                Correction: the condition for Polycarpus win (i.e., when Nikephoros loses) is when the outcome is one of the three that are not draws and not the three we listed? \n\n                Actually, the three we listed are the ones that make Nikephoros win. \n\n                The three cases for Polycarpus win (i.e., when Polycarpus's move beats Nikephoros's move) are:\n\n                    (S,R): S beats R -> Polycarpus wins (because his move S beats Nikephoros's R)\n                    (P,S): P beats S -> Polycarpus wins\n                    (R,P): R beats P -> Polycarpus wins? No, wait: R vs P: the rule says Paper beats Rock -> so if Polycarpus has P and Nikephoros has R, then Polycarpus wins.\n\n                But wait, the rule: \n                    Rock beats Scissors.\n                    Scissors beats Paper.\n                    Paper beats Rock.\n\n                So for Polycarpus to win, his move must beat Nikephoros's move.\n\n                Therefore, the condition for Polycarpus win is:\n\n                    (B's move) beats (A's move)\n\n                Which is the opposite of the condition we used.\n\n                We used: \n                    if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then Nikephoros wins.\n\n                This is correct because in those cases, A's move (a_char) beats B's move (b_char).\n\n                Therefore, the condition for Polycarpus win is the complement (excluding draws and the above).\n\n                The three conditions for Polycarpus win are:\n\n                    (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n\n                Or equivalently, the condition for Polycarpus win is:\n\n                    (a_char, b_char) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]\n\n                So we made a mistake: we defined the condition for Nikephoros win as (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n\n                But note: in the example round4: (R,P) is (a_char='R', b_char='P') -> this is not in the list [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. \n\n                However, the rule says: Paper beats Rock -> so when A shows 'R' and B shows 'P', then B wins. \n\n                So we need to change the condition.\n\n                Alternatively, we can think: \n\n                    We want to know who wins.\n\n                Let me redefine the outcome:\n\n                    if a_char == b_char: draw.\n\n                    else if (a_char, b_char) == ('R','S') or ('S','P') or ('P','R'): then a_char wins -> so the loser is b_char's owner (Polycarpus) -> so we count for Polycarpus.\n\n                    else: then b_char wins -> so the loser is a_char's owner (Nikephoros) -> we count for Nikephoros.\n\n                But wait, the example round4: (R,P) is not in the first condition, so we go to else -> that would be correct (because P beats R). \n\n                However, the condition for the first if (a_char wins) is:\n\n                    (R,S): R beats S -> correct.\n                    (S,P): S beats P -> correct.\n                    (P,R): P beats R -> correct.\n\n                Then (R,P) is not in that list, so we go to else. \n\n                But wait, (R,P) is a win for P (which is B, Polycarpus) so we should count for Polycarpus. \n\n                However, in our condition, we are saying:\n\n                    if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]: then Polycarpus loses (so we count 1 for Polycarpus) -> no, wait: \n\n                We defined:\n\n                    if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                        outcome = 1   (meaning Polycarpus loses) -> so we add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots? \n\n                But that is backwards: \n\n                    In round4, we have (R,P) -> which is a win for Polycarpus, so we should add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots? \n\n                Actually, no: the loser gets the red spot. \n\n                When Polycarpus wins (i.e., B wins), then Nikephoros (who showed R) loses -> so we add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots.\n\n                Therefore, we must reverse the outcome meaning:\n\n                    We defined outcome=1 for the case (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] meaning that a_char wins (so Polycarpus loses) -> so we add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots.\n\n                    But then, in round4, (R,P) is not in that list, so we go to the else and set outcome=-1 (meaning b_char wins) and then we add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots.\n\n                This is consistent.\n\n                However, let me check the example round4 again:\n\n                    Round4: (R,P): outcome=-1 -> so we add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots. \n\n                But according to the example, in round4: \"R - P\" -> Polycarpus wins (because P beats R), so Nikephoros loses -> so we should add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots. \n\n                This matches.\n\n                Now, round3: (S,P): \n                    (S,P) is in the list [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so outcome=1 -> add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots.\n\n                Round3: \"S - P\": Polycarpus wins? No, wait: S vs P: the rule says scissors beats paper, so if Nikephoros (A) shows S and Polycarpus (B) shows P, then S beats P -> so Nikephoros wins. Then Polycarpus loses.\n\n                But wait, the example says: \"S - P. Polycarpus loses\". \n\n                So that is correct.\n\n                But wait: in round3, (S,P) is in the list, so we add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots? \n\n                The rule: \n                    If (a_char, b_char) is ('S','P'): then a_char (S) beats b_char (P). So the winner is a_char (Nikephoros) and the loser is b_char (Polycarpus). \n\n                Therefore, we should add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots.\n\n                This is correct.\n\n                Then, why did I get confused earlier? \n\n                The issue was in the example round4: (R,P) is not in the list, so we go to the else and that means the winner is B (Polycarpus) and so we add 1 to Nikephoros's red spots.\n\n                Now, let me recompute the example with the corrected understanding:\n\n                Round1: (R,R) -> draw -> no one.\n                Round2: (P,S) -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> else: so winner is B (Polycarpus) -> add 1 to Nikephoros.\n                Round3: (S,P) -> in the list: add 1 to Polycarpus.\n                Round4: (R,P) -> not in the list: add 1 to Nikephoros.\n                Round5: (P,R) -> (P,R) is in the list: add 1 to Polycarpus.\n                Round6: (S,S) -> draw.\n                Round7: (R,P) -> not in the list: add 1 to Nikephoros.\n\n                So total:\n                    Nikephoros: 3 (rounds2,4,7)\n                    Polycarpus: 2 (rounds3,5)\n\n                This matches the example.\n\n                Therefore, the condition is correct.\n\n   Code summary:\n\n        Step1: Read n, A, B.\n        Step2: m = len(A), k = len(B)\n        Step3: T = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n        Step4: Precompute the counts for one period (T rounds) for the entire period (0 to T-1) for outcomes 1 and -1.\n\n        But wait: we have two separate counts: \n            count1: number of rounds in the period where (a_char, b_char) is one of [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] (then outcome=1, meaning Polycarpus loses)\n            count_minus1: number of rounds in the period where (a_char, b_char) is not in the above list and not equal (then outcome=-1, meaning Nikephoros loses)\n\n        However, note: the condition for outcome=1 is the three winning conditions for Nikephoros, and outcome=-1 is the three winning conditions for Polycarpus.\n\n        Step5: full_cycles = n // T\n               remainder = n % T\n\n        Step6: For the period: \n                period_win_nike = count1   (number of times outcome=1, i.e., Nikephoros wins)\n                period_win_poly = count_minus1 (number of times outcome=-1, i.e., Polycarpus wins)\n\n        Step7: Then, for the remainder part (0 to remainder-1), we do the same.\n\n        Then, total wins for Nikephoros (red spots) = full_cycles * period_win_poly (because each time outcome=-1, Nikephoros loses) + (count_minus1 in remainder)\n\n        And total wins for Polycarpus (red spots) = full_cycles * period_win_nike (each time outcome=1, Polycarpus loses) + (count1 in remainder)\n\n        Wait, no: \n\n            In the period, we have:\n                outcome=1: Polycarpus loses -> so that round adds 1 to Polycarpus's red spots.\n                outcome=-1: Nikephoros loses -> so that round adds 1 to Nikephoros's red spots.\n\n            Therefore, in the period, the number of red spots for Nikephoros is the count of outcome=-1 (period_win_poly) and for Polycarpus is the count of outcome=1 (period_win_nike).\n\n            Then, for the entire n rounds:\n\n                nike_red = full_cycles * period_win_poly + (count of -1 in remainder)\n                poly_red = full_cycles * period_win_nike + (count of 1 in remainder)\n\n        However, wait: in the period, we counted:\n\n                period_win_nike = count of outcome=1 (which is the number of rounds where Polycarpus loses, i.e., Polycarpus gets a red spot)\n                period_win_poly = count of outcome=-1 (which is the number of rounds where Nikephoros loses, i.e., Nikephoros gets a red spot)\n\n        Then, for the remainder, we must count:\n\n                rem_win_nike = count of outcome=1 in the remainder rounds (which will add to Polycarpus's red spots)\n                rem_win_poly = count of outcome=-1 in the remainder rounds (which will add to Nikephoros's red spots)\n\n        So:\n\n            nike_red = full_cycles * period_win_poly + rem_win_poly\n            poly_red = full_cycles * period_win_nike + rem_win_nike\n\n        This is correct.\n\n   Let me test with the example:\n\n        Period T=12, but we only did 7 rounds (which is less than 12). \n\n        We computed for 7 rounds:\n\n            period_win_nike (outcome=1) = 4   [rounds3,4,5,7?] -> wait, let me recount for the 7 rounds:\n\n                t0: (R,R) -> 0\n                t1: (P,S) -> -1 -> so period_win_poly (outcome=-1) +=1\n                t2: (S,P) -> 1 -> period_win_nike +=1\n                t3: (R,P) -> -1 -> period_win_poly +=1\n                t4: (P,R) -> 1 -> period_win_nike +=1\n                t5: (S,S) -> 0\n                t6: (R,P) -> -1 -> period_win_poly +=1\n\n            So for the 7 rounds (which is the remainder part, since full_cycles=0):\n\n                period_win_nike (for remainder) = 2 (from t2 and t4)\n                period_win_poly (for remainder) = 3 (from t1, t3, t6)\n\n            Then, \n                nike_red = 0 * period_win_poly (which is 3) + 3 = 3\n                poly_red = 0 * period_win_nike (which is 2) + 2 = 2\n\n            But wait, in the example, the period_win_nike for the entire period (T=12) would be the count",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and each round's outcome depends on the current move in their respective sequences. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results without simulating each round individually, especially since `n` can be as large as 2·10^9.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players taking turns to show rock, paper, or scissors based on their cyclic sequences. The outcome of each round determines if a player gets a red spot (a loss). Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible for large `n`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The outcomes repeat every `T` rounds, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This periodicity allows us to compute the results for one period and extrapolate to cover all `n` rounds.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Compute LCM**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period `T`.\n   - **Period Simulation**: For each round in one period `T`, determine if it's a win for Nikephoros (outcome -1) or Polycarpus (outcome 1). Count these occurrences.\n   - **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Break down `n` rounds into full cycles of `T` and a remaining partial cycle. Use precomputed counts for full cycles and simulate the remaining rounds separately.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences. The main operations involve computing the LCM and simulating up to `T` rounds, where `T` is at most 1,000,000 (since sequence lengths are ≤ 1000), making the solution feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A = data[1].strip()\n    B = data[2].strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n    \n    count1_period = 0\n    count_minus1_period = 0\n    for t in range(T):\n        a_char = A[t % m]\n        b_char = B[t % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            count1_period += 1\n        else:\n            count_minus1_period += 1\n            \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    nike_red_from_full = full_cycles * count_minus1_period\n    poly_red_from_full = full_cycles * count1_period\n    \n    count1_remainder = 0\n    count_minus1_remainder = 0\n    for t in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A[t % m]\n        b_char = B[t % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            count1_remainder += 1\n        else:\n            count_minus1_remainder += 1\n            \n    nike_red = nike_red_from_full + count_minus1_remainder\n    poly_red = poly_red_from_full + count1_remainder\n    \n    print(f\"{nike_red} {poly_red}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the two sequences `A` and `B` representing the moves of Nikephoros and Polycarpus, respectively.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The period `T` is computed as the LCM of the lengths of `A` and `B` to determine the repeating cycle of outcomes.\n3. **Period Simulation**: For each round in one period `T`, the code checks if the current moves result in a win for Nikephoros (counted as -1) or Polycarpus (counted as 1). Draws are ignored.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder Handling**: The total rounds `n` are split into full cycles (`full_cycles`) and a remainder (`remainder`). The results from full cycles are derived from precomputed counts, while the remainder is simulated directly.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The total red spots for each player are computed by summing the results from full cycles and the remainder. The final counts are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large input size by leveraging periodicity and avoids the need for brute-force simulation of each round.",
