Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (number of rebels and bases) and then 2R+B points (R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases). We need to check if there exists a perfect matching (one-to-one assignment) between the R rebels and the B bases such that the straight line segments (from each base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" (from a base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect. This means that if we assign each spaceship to a base with a straight line, then no two such lines should cross.\n\n But note: the problem also says that the assignment is a perfect matching (so we must assign every base to exactly one spaceship and vice versa). Therefore, we have a bipartite graph between R rebels and B bases, but we are not given edges. Instead, we are only concerned with the geometric condition.\n\n However, wait: the input does not specify which bases are connected to which rebels by an edge? Actually, the problem does not say that we must consider all possible edges. It says: \"if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So we are allowed to choose any matching (any assignment) as long as the straight lines drawn from each base to its spaceship do not intersect.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the bases are connected only to some rebels. We are to consider all points and then see if there is a perfect matching (if R==B) or if R != B then we cannot have a perfect matching? Wait, the problem states: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so we require |R| = |B|? Actually, the input says R and B (both at least 1, up to 10). Then we have R rebels and B bases. The problem requires a perfect matching, meaning we need to assign all R rebels to B bases such that each base gets exactly one. But if R != B, then it's impossible. However, note the example: the first example has R=3, B=3. The second example has R=2, B=1.\n\n So, if R != B, then we cannot have a perfect matching (each base has one and each rebel has one). Therefore, we must output \"No\" in the second example.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"output Yes, otherwise output No\". And the second example input is \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\". Here R=2, B=1 -> not equal, so no perfect matching. Therefore, we output \"No\".\n\n However, the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the input format is as described.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If R != B, then output 'No' because we cannot have a perfect matching (unless we are allowed to use more than one base for a rebel? But the problem says \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", meaning one-to-one).\n\n 2. If R == B, then we must find a perfect matching (a bijection) between the R rebels and the B bases such that the straight line segments connecting each base to its assigned rebel do not intersect.\n\n But note: the problem does not say that we can choose which rebels go to which bases arbitrarily. We must consider all possible assignments? However, since R and B are at most 10, we could in principle try all permutations (which would be factorial in R, so 10! = 3628800, which is acceptable in worst-case). But wait: we have to check for non-intersecting segments for a given matching.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the entire set of R rebels and B bases form a set of points that are in general position (they are, given that no three are collinear and no two coincide). \n\n How to check for non-intersecting segments in a matching?\n\n In a matching, we have R segments (each connecting one rebel to one base). Two segments AB and CD (where A and C are rebels, B and D are bases) do not intersect if they don't cross. However, note that the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" do not intersect. So we must check that no two segments cross.\n\n But note: the segments are drawn from bases to rebels, so the endpoints are fixed. However, the matching assigns each base to one rebel. The problem does not specify that the rebels and bases are labeled arbitrarily. But we are free to assign.\n\n However, the problem does not specify that the rebels and bases are labeled. We are given the list of rebels and bases. But note: the input order: first R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible perfect matchings if the number of spaceships equals the number of bases, and directly returning \"No\" if they are unequal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a perfect matching (one-to-one assignment) between R spaceships and B bases. If R ≠ B, it's impossible to have such a matching, so the answer is immediately \"No\". If R = B, we need to check all possible permutations of assigning each spaceship to a base and verify if any permutation results in non-intersecting line segments.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each permutation of base assignments, we can check for segment intersections by leveraging the fact that two segments (A-B and C-D) intersect if the points C and D lie on opposite sides of the line defined by A-B, and vice versa (using the cross product method).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Since R and B are small (up to 10), we can generate all possible permutations of base assignments (R! possibilities) and check each permutation for non-intersecting segments. This brute-force approach is feasible due to the small input size.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case scenario involves generating all permutations of R bases, which is R! operations. For R=10, this is 3,628,800 operations, which is manageable for modern computers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    r = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    points = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(r):\n        x = int(data[index])\n        y = int(data[index+1])\n        index += 2\n        points.append((x, y))\n        \n    rebels = points[:r]\n    bases = points[r:r+b]\n    \n    if r != b:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    n = r\n    \n    def cross(o, a, b):\n        return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n    \n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        o1 = cross(a, b, c)\n        o2 = cross(a, b, d)\n        o3 = cross(c, d, a)\n        o4 = cross(c, d, b)\n        \n        if ((o1 > 0 and o2 < 0) or (o1 < 0 and o2 > 0)) and ((o3 > 0 and o4 < 0) or (o3 < 0 and o4 > 0)):\n            return True\n            \n        if o1 == 0 or o2 == 0 or o3 == 0 or o4 == 0:\n            return False\n            \n        return False\n        \n    def is_valid_assignment(perm):\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                seg1 = (rebels[i], bases[perm[i]])\n                seg2 = (rebels[j], bases[perm[j]])\n                if segments_intersect(seg1[0], seg1[1], seg2[0], seg2[1]):\n                    return False\n        return True\n        \n    permutations_list = list(itertools.permutations(range(b)))\n    found = False\n    for perm in permutations_list:\n        if is_valid_assignment(perm):\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), followed by their coordinates.\n2. **Immediate Check**: If R ≠ B, output \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Cross Product Calculation**: The `cross` function computes the cross product to determine the orientation of three points, which helps in checking segment intersections.\n4. **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the cross product to verify if two segments intersect by checking if the endpoints of one segment lie on opposite sides of the other segment's line.\n5. **Permutation Check**: For each permutation of base assignments, the `is_valid_assignment` function checks if all segments formed by the assignment are non-intersecting.\n6. **Result Determination**: If any valid permutation is found, print \"Yes\"; otherwise, print \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments by leveraging permutations and geometric intersection checks, ensuring correctness within feasible computational limits for the given constraints.",
