Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n We have two players: Homer (H) and Marge (M). Each makes exactly n moves.\n On each move, the leftmost digit is taken and appended to the respective player's number.\n\n The goal is to choose a sequence of moves (a string of length 2n containing n 'H's and n 'M's) such that the total prize (which is the value of S1 plus the value of S2) is maximized.\n\n Note: The total prize is just the numerical value of S1 plus the numerical value of S2. However, note that the numbers are built by taking the digits in order from A, but the assignment to H or M is determined by the sequence.\n\n Since the entire string A is fixed and we are only deciding the order of taking digits (each digit is taken from the left until the string is exhausted), we can think of it as partitioning the 2n digits into two sequences (for H and M) of length n each.\n\n However, note: the moves are sequential and the digits are taken from the left in order. But the catch is that we decide at each step which player takes the current leftmost digit.\n\n So the problem is: assign each digit to either H or M (with exactly n for each) such that the sum of the numbers formed by the digits assigned to H and the ones assigned to M is maximized.\n\n But note: the numbers are built from the digits in the order they appear. However, the catch is that the digits are taken from the left, so the first digit assigned to H will be the first digit of A, then if the next is assigned to M, then that second digit becomes the first digit of M's number, etc.\n\n Example: \n   Input: n=2, A = \"1234\"\n\n   Possibilities:\n     If we do HHMM: \n        H takes the first digit: 1 -> S1 = 1, then second digit: 2 -> S1 becomes 12.\n        Then M takes the third digit: 3 -> S2 = 3, then fourth: 4 -> S2 becomes 34.\n        Total prize = 12 + 34 = 46.\n\n     If we do HMHM:\n        H: first digit (1) -> S1=1, then third digit (3) -> S1=13.\n        M: second digit (2) -> S2=2, then fourth digit (4) -> S2=24.\n        Total prize = 13+24 = 37.\n\n     If we do HM MH: (actually same as above? wait, the example output says two possibilities: 'HHMM' and 'HMHM')\n\n   But note: the example input also includes ['2\\n9911'] and outputs ['HMHM'].\n\n   Let me check with A=\"9911\", n=2:\n\n   Possibility: HHMM\n        H: 99, M: 11 -> total = 99+11 = 110.\n\n   Possibility: HMHM\n        H: 9 and then 1 -> 91, M: 9 and then 1 -> 91 -> total = 91+91 = 182.\n\n   So in this case, HMHM is better.\n\n Therefore, the problem is to assign the digits to two players (each n digits) such that the two numbers (formed by the digits in the order of their appearance) add up to the maximum.\n\n However, note: the digits are taken from the left, so the assignment must be in contiguous blocks? Not necessarily. Actually, the assignment is arbitrary as long as the order of the digits in each player's number is the same as their occurrence in A.\n\n But note: the process is sequential. The first move takes the first digit, the second move takes the next, etc. So the assignment is by position: the i-th digit (from left) is assigned to one of the players, and the order of the digits in each player's number is the order of their positions.\n\n However, the problem is that the digits are being removed from the left, so we cannot change the order.\n\n Now, how to maximize the sum? \n\n Let the two numbers be X and Y. Each digit's contribution depends on its position and the assignment.\n\n But note: the first digit of A must be assigned to one of the players. Then the next to the other or the same, etc.\n\n However, the entire string is fixed. The value of the number for a player is the concatenation of the digits assigned to that player in the order they were taken.\n\n Since the digits are taken from left to right, the first digit assigned to a player becomes the most significant digit.\n\n We can consider dynamic programming. We have 2n digits, and we need to assign each digit to either H or M, with n for each.\n\n But note: the assignment must be done in the order of the digits (we cannot assign a later digit to a player before assigning an earlier one).\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the entire process as building two numbers: one for H and one for M. The first digit (index0) goes to one of them, the second to one of them, etc.\n\n The value of the number for H is the base-10 number formed by the digits assigned to H, and similarly for M.\n\n However, note: the same digit cannot be used twice, and the order of the digits in the number is fixed by the order they appear.\n\n We wish to maximize (value of H's number) + (value of M's number).\n\n How to break down?\n\n Let the digits be d0, d1, d2, ..., d_{2n-1}.\n\n Then, the total value can be written as:\n\n   Sum_{i=0}^{2n-1} d_i * 10^{k_i}\n\n where k_i is the exponent for the digit d_i in the number to which it was assigned.\n\n For H, if the digit d_i is assigned to H and is the j-th digit (from left) in H's number, then its exponent is (total length of H's number - j) [if we consider the entire number as having n digits]. Similarly for M.\n\n But note: we don't know the positions in the final number until we know the entire assignment.\n\n Alternatively, we can use DP that tracks:\n\n   state: (pos, count_H, count_M, num_H_so_far, num_M_so_far)\n\n But the numbers can be up to 2n digits, and n<=18, so the numbers have up to 18 digits, which is too big to store as integers (but actually 18 digits is about 10^18, which is acceptable for Python integers? However, the state space is 2n * (n+1) * (n+1) * (10^n) * (10^n) -> too huge.\n\n Another idea: the assignment is fixed by the sequence. The total sum is independent of the order of assignment? No, because the same digit in different positions has different place values.\n\n However, note: the entire string is fixed, and the assignment is to two numbers of n digits each. The total sum is:\n\n   Let the assignment be a binary string of length 2n (0 for H, 1 for M). Then the value is:\n\n      H_value = sum_{i: assignment[i]==0} d_i * 10^{(position_in_H)}\n\n   But the position in H depends on the order in which the digits are assigned to H. Specifically, the first time we assign a digit to H, that digit becomes the most significant (exponent n-1), the next becomes n-2, etc.\n\n Similarly for M.\n\n So the exponent for a digit d_i is determined by the number of digits that are assigned to the same player that appear after it (in the original string) and the total number of digits assigned to that player.\n\n Alternatively, we can note:\n\n   The total contribution of a digit d_i is d_i * 10^{e_i}, where e_i is (n - 1 - r_i) for H, and (n - 1 - s_i) for M, where r_i is the rank (starting from 0) of the digit d_i in the sequence of digits assigned to that player.\n\n But note: the rank in the player's number is determined by the order of assignment: the first digit assigned to a player is the most significant (exponent n-1), the next n-2, etc.\n\n However, we can also think: the entire game proceeds sequentially. At each step, we have two numbers (for H and M) that are being built, and we choose which one to add the next digit to.\n\n The next digit is the current leftmost of the remaining string.\n\n The value of adding a digit d to a number that currently has k digits (so it will become k+1) is: d * (10^k) [because the existing digits shift left by one, and the new digit becomes the least significant].\n\n But note: the entire number will have n digits. So when we add the first digit to H, we are setting the most significant digit (exponent n-1). Then if we add a second digit to H, we are adding d * (10^(n-2)), and so on.\n\n So the total value for H is:\n\n   Let the digits assigned to H be d_{i1}, d_{i2}, ... d_{in} (in the order of assignment). Then the value is:\n\n        d_{i1} * 10^(n-1) + d_{i2} * 10^(n-2) + ... + d_{in} * 10^0\n\n Similarly for M.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: we have 2n digits, and we wish to split them into two subsequences (each of length n) that preserve the relative order (the original order) and maximize:\n\n        [d_{i1} * 10^(n-1) + ... + d_{in} * 10^0] + [d_{j1} * 10^(n-1) + ... + d_{jn} * 10^0]\n\n How to solve?\n\n We can use dynamic programming that considers:\n\n   dp[i][j][k] = maximum total value (for both H and M) we can achieve after processing the first i+j digits, having assigned j digits to H and i digits to M (or vice versa, but let's say we assign H and M arbitrarily). But we also need to know the exponents that will be applied to future digits.\n\n Alternatively, we can think greedily: we want to assign the largest digits to the highest exponents. But note: the exponents are fixed by the order of assignment to a particular player.\n\n However, the catch is that the assignment must be in the order of the digits (we cannot assign a digit to H if there's an unassigned digit to the left that is assigned to M, because the moves are sequential and the digits are taken from the left).\n\n Actually, the assignment is forced: we must assign the first digit to someone, then the next, etc.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the entire assignment to be done in a particular way beyond the constraint that each player gets exactly n moves.\n\n We can use DP that goes over the 2n digits and decides at each step which player takes the digit. But we also need to track:\n\n   - How many digits have been assigned to H and M (so far)\n   - The current total value for H and M? But the value depends on the entire assignment, and the exponents are known only at the time of assignment (and depend on the remaining digits).\n\n Actually, we can compute the exponent for a digit at the moment we assign it: if we assign a digit to H, then we know that this will be the (current_count_H)-th digit for H (counting from 0 to n-1). Then the exponent for that digit is (n - 1 - current_count_H).\n\n Similarly for M.\n\n Then the value added by assigning the current digit (say d) to H is: d * (10 ** (n-1 - current_count_H))\n\n And similarly for M.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   dp[i][h] = maximum total value (for both players) we can get from the first i digits, having assigned h digits to H (then M has i-h digits). Then the next digit (the (i+1)-th) will be assigned to either H (if h < n) or M (if i-h < n).\n\n But wait: we must assign exactly n to each, so we can only assign to H if h < n and to M if (i-h) < n.\n\n Then:\n\n   dp[i][h] = max {\n        if we assign the next digit (i-th, 0-indexed, so we are at the i-th digit, having processed i digits) to H: dp[i+1][h+1] + (digit_i * (10**(n-1-h)))\n        if we assign to M: dp[i+1][h] + (digit_i * (10**(n-1-(i-h))))   [because for M, the current count is i-h, so exponent is n-1 - (i-h)]\n\n   }\n\n However, note: the digits are taken in order, so the i-th digit is the next one.\n\n But wait: the exponent for M is determined by the number of digits already assigned to M? Actually, no: the exponent for a digit assigned to M is (n-1 - (rank in M)). The rank in M is the count of M's digits so far (including the one we are assigning). So if we have assigned m digits to M so far, then the next digit for M will be the (m)-th (0-indexed) so exponent n-1-m.\n\n But note: in the state, we have h for H and then the number of M's digits is i - h.\n\n So the exponent for H is n-1 - h (if we assign the next digit to H, then the exponent for that digit is n-1 - h, because h is the current count for H and we are about to assign the (h+1)-th digit, which is the (n-1 - h)-th power).\n\n Similarly, for M, the exponent is n-1 - (i-h) [because we have i-h digits already for M, and we are going to assign the (i-h+1)-th, so the exponent is n-1 - (i-h)].\n\n But note: the state i and h: i is the total digits processed, and h is the count for H. Then the state must go from 0 to 2n, and h from 0 to n.\n\n However, the exponent calculation for M: the exponent is n-1 - (number of M's digits including this one) = n-1 - (i-h+1) ??? \n\n Wait, no: the exponent for a digit assigned to M is (n-1 - the rank of that digit in M's number). The rank is the order in which the digit appears in M's number. The first digit assigned to M (in the entire game) will be the most significant (exponent n-1), the second n-2, etc.\n\n In our DP, when we are at state (i, h) and we assign the next digit (the i-th digit, which is the (i+1)-th digit overall) to M, then the number of M's digits so far (before this assignment) is (i-h). Then this assignment is the (i-h+1)-th M's digit. Therefore, the exponent is (n-1 - (i-h)) [because the first M's digit gets exponent n-1, the second n-2, ... and the (i-h+1)-th gets exponent n-1 - (i-h)].\n\n However, note: the state i is the index of the last processed digit (so we have processed i digits, and the next is the i-th digit, 0-indexed). Then the next digit is the i-th (if we start at 0). Then we update i to i+1.\n\n But we must be cautious: the exponent for H is n-1 - h (because h is the current count of H, and we are about to assign the (h+1)-th, so the exponent is n-1 - h). Similarly for M, the current count of M is (i-h) (before this assignment) and after assignment it becomes i-h+1, so the exponent is n-1 - (i-h) [but wait, we haven't updated i to i+1 yet, so at the moment of assignment, the count of M is i-h, and the next digit for M will be the (i-h+1)-th, so the exponent is n-1 - (i-h) (because the first M digit gets exponent n-1, the second n-2, so the (k+1)-th gets exponent n-1-k). Here k = i-h (the current count of M).\n\n However, note: the state i is the number of digits processed. The next digit is the i-th (0-indexed, so the first digit is at index0). Then:\n\n   dp[0][0] = 0\n\n   Then for state (i, h): \n        Let m = i - h   (number of M's digits so far)\n        Option 1: assign the next digit (A[i]) to H (if h < n)\n            value_H = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h))\n            then next state: (i+1, h+1)\n            dp[i+1][h+1] = max(dp[i+1][h+1], dp[i][h] + value_H)\n\n        Option 2: assign the next digit (A[i]) to M (if m < n)\n            value_M = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-m))\n            then next state: (i+1, h)\n            dp[i+1][h] = max(dp[i+1][h], dp[i][h] + value_M)\n\n   Then the answer is the maximum of dp[2n][n] (since we must have n for H and n for M, so i=2n and h=n, then m=2n-n=n).\n\n However, we also need to recover the sequence of moves.\n\n We can store the DP state and then backtrack. But note: the exponents are computed with powers of 10, and we are using integers. The numbers can be very large (n up to 18, so 10**17 is the maximum exponent, and the numbers can be up to 10**(2n) which is 10^36, but Python integers can handle that, but the DP table would be 2n * (n+1) states, which is 36 * 19 ~ 684 states, so it's small.\n\n But wait: the exponent for the digit at state (i, h) when assigning to H is 10**(n-1-h). We must compute these powers. However, note that h is from 0 to n, so we can precompute the exponents for H for each h.\n\n Similarly, for M, the exponent is 10**(n-1-m) and m = i-h (at the moment of assignment, the current M count is m = i-h). But note: i goes from 0 to 2n-1, and h from 0 to n, so m = i-h can be negative? No, because i>=h (since m = i-h, and we are at state (i, h) and i>=h because we have processed i digits and h is the count of H, and the rest are M, so i-h is the count of M, which must be nonnegative and <= i). Also, we require that m < n for assigning to M.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Precompute a list for H: exp_H[k] = 10**(n-1-k) for k in range(0, n+1) (for k from 0 to n, but if k>n, we don't use, but we only use k from 0 to n-1)\n\n   Similarly, for M: for a given state (i, h), the exponent for M is 10**(n-1 - (i-h)) but note: we must ensure that (i-h) < n (otherwise we cannot assign to M). And we are only assigning when (i-h) < n.\n\n However, note: we might have i-h >= n? Then we cannot assign to M. But in our DP, we check the condition: if m < n, then we can assign to M.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Let n_digits = 2*n\n   dp[i][h] = maximum total value after processing i digits (from 0 to n_digits) and having assigned h digits to H (so M has i-h digits).\n\n   We'll create a 2D DP array of size (n_digits+1) x (n+1), initialized to -infinity or a very small number, except dp[0][0]=0.\n\n   Precompute:\n        exp_H[k] = 10**(n-1-k) for k in range(0, n)   # for k from 0 to n-1; for k>=n, we don't use (but we only assign if h < n, so k from 0 to n-1)\n\n   But note: when we assign a digit to H, the exponent is based on the current count h (which will be incremented by one). Similarly for M.\n\n   However, the exponent for M is determined by the current count of M (which is i-h) and is 10**(n-1 - (i-h))? \n\n   Let me check with example: n=2, A=\"1234\", and we assign the first digit to H.\n\n        state: i=0, h=0, m=0.\n        Assign first digit '1' to H: exponent for H is n-1-h = 2-1-0 = 1 -> 10^1 = 10, so value_H = 1*10 = 10.\n        Then state: i=1, h=1.\n\n        Then next digit is '2'. Now if we assign to H again: exponent = n-1-h = 2-1-1 = 0 -> 10^0=1, so value_H=2*1=2, total=12.\n        Then state: i=2, h=2.\n\n        Then we must assign the next two digits to M.\n\n        For the third digit '3': assign to M, then exponent for M is n-1 - (i-h) = 2-1 - (2-2)= 1 - 0 = 1 -> 10^1=10, so value_M=3*10=30, total=12+30=42.\n        Then state: i=3, h=2, m=1.\n        Then fourth digit: assign to M, exponent= n-1 - (i-h) = 2-1 - (3-2)= 1-1=0 -> 1, value_M=4*1=4, total=46.\n\n   That matches the example.\n\n   Now, for the alternative assignment: \n        First digit to M: exponent for M: n-1 - (i-h) = 2-1 - (0-0)=1 -> 10, so value_M=1*10=10, state: i=1, h=0, m=1.\n        Second digit: assign to H: exponent for H: n-1-0=1, value_H=2*10=20, total=10+20=30, state: i=2, h=1, m=1.\n        Third digit: assign to H: exponent for H: n-1-1=0, value_H=3*1=3, total=33, state: i=3, h=2, m=1.\n        Fourth digit: assign to M: exponent for M: n-1 - (3-2)=1, value_M=4*10=40, total=73? \n\n   But wait, that doesn't match the example. Let me recalc:\n\n        Sequence: M, H, H, M -> the two numbers are:\n            M: first digit (from A[0]) is 1, and then fourth digit is 4 -> number M = 14? (But wait, the moves: \n                Move1: M takes the first digit -> M's number is \"1\"\n                Move2: H takes the second digit -> H's number is \"2\"\n                Move3: H takes the third digit -> H's number is \"23\"\n                Move4: M takes the fourth digit -> M's number is \"14\"\n\n            Then total = 23 + 14 = 37.\n\n        In the DP above, we did:\n\n            First: M: 1 * 10^(1) = 10.\n            Second: H: 2 * 10^(1) [because n-1-0=1] -> 20.\n            Third: H: 3 * 10^(0) = 3.\n            Fourth: M: 4 * 10^(n-1 - (3-2)) = 4 * 10^(2-1-1)=4*10^0=4.\n\n            Total=10+20+3+4=37.\n\n        Why did I get 73 above? Because I mistakenly thought the exponent for the fourth digit for M is 10^1, but actually the exponent for M is determined by the current count of M (which is 1, because we've already assigned one M). The exponent for the second M (fourth digit) is 10^(n-1 - (current M count)) = 10^(2-1-1)=10^0.\n\n        So the DP calculation is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        dp[i][h] = maximum total value after processing i digits and having assigned h digits to H.\n\n        For each state (i, h):\n            Let m = i - h   (number of M's digits so far)\n            If h < n: \n                value_assign_to_H = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h))\n                dp[i+1][h+1] = max(dp[i+1][h+1], dp[i][h] + value_assign_to_H)\n\n            If m < n:   (i.e., if i-h < n)\n                value_assign_to_M = int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-m))\n                dp[i+1][h] = max(dp[i+1][h], dp[i][h] + value_assign_to_M)\n\n   Then we need to reconstruct the sequence.\n\n   We can store a parent pointer: from state (i, h) we know from which state (i-1, h_prev) we came and what was the move.\n\n   We'll maintain:\n\n        dp[i][h] = (best_value, prev_state, move)\n\n   Alternatively, we can store a 2D array parent[i][h] = (prev_i, prev_h, last_move) but we don't need the whole path, just the last move.\n\n   Actually, we can store two arrays: one for the best value and then backtrack by checking which option led to the current state.\n\n   Steps for backtracking:\n\n        Start from (i=2n, h=n) (which is the goal state)\n        Then we want to know: the last digit (the 2n-1 index) was assigned to whom? \n\n        But note: the state (2n, n) means we have processed all 2n digits, and H has n digits.\n\n        How did we get here?\n          We must have come from (2n-1, n-1) by assigning the last digit to H, OR from (2n-1, n) by assigning the last digit to M? \n\n        Actually, the last digit (at index 2n-1) is the one that we assign at state i=2n-1.\n\n        In state (2n-1, h) we assign the last digit (A[2n-1]) to either:\n\n          Option 1: H -> then we require h < n (so h must be n-1) and then we update to (2n, n) and the value added is int(A[2n-1]) * (10**(n-1-n)) -> but wait, n-1-n is negative? \n\n        Correction: the exponent for H when assigning the last digit (if we assign to H) is n-1 - h, and h is the current count of H (before assignment) which is n-1, so exponent = n-1 - (n-1) = 0.\n\n        Similarly, if we assign to M, then the exponent is n-1 - (i-h) = n-1 - (2n-1 - h). And we require that i-h < n, i.e., 2n-1-h < n -> h > n-1, but h is at most n (but in state (2n-1, h) we have h<=n, but the condition for M is 2n-1-h < n -> h > n-1, so h must be n. Then exponent = n-1 - (2n-1-n) = n-1 - (n-1) = 0.\n\n        So the last digit always has exponent 0? Yes, because it's the last digit for the respective player.\n\n        But wait, the state (2n-1, n) is invalid for assigning to H (because h=n, we cannot assign more to H). And for M: we require that the current M count (which is 2n-1-n) is less than n, i.e., 2n-1-n < n -> n-1 < n, which is true. But then the exponent is n-1 - (2n-1-n) = n-1 - (n-1) = 0.\n\n        So we can backtrack by:\n\n            Let i = 2n, h = n.\n            We don't know the last move. We look at the two possibilities:\n\n            Possibility 1: the last move was H. Then we must have come from (2n-1, n-1) and the last digit was assigned to H.\n\n            Possibility 2: the last move was M. Then we must have come from (2n-1, n) and the last digit was assigned to M.\n\n            But note: the state (2n-1, n) is valid? Then we could have come from (2n-1, n) by assigning to M, but then the state (2n-1, n) requires that we had processed 2n-1 digits and assigned n digits to H, so the M count is (2n-1-n). Then we assign the last digit to M, and then the M count becomes (2n-1-n)+1 = 2n-n = n, which is allowed.\n\n            However, we must know the value of dp[2n-1][n-1] and dp[2n-1][n] and see which one led to the maximum.\n\n            But wait, we stored the maximum value for each state. Then we can backtrack by:\n\n                Let current = (i=2n, h=n)\n\n                Then we look at the two transitions that lead to (2n, n):\n\n                    Transition 1: from (2n-1, n-1) by assigning the last digit (A[2n-1]) to H.\n                    Transition 2: from (2n-1, n) by assigning the last digit (A[2n-1]) to M.\n\n                Then we check which transition was taken (the one that has the same value as dp[2n][n] minus the value added by the last digit, and matches the previous state).\n\n            Alternatively, we can store the choice at each state.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let dp[i][h] be the maximum total value, and let choice[i][h] be:\n                0 if the last move (at the i-th digit) was not defined (base state) or we don't know.\n                Actually, we can store from which direction we came and the move.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                dp[i][h] = (value, from_state, move_char)\n\n            But to save memory, we can store two arrays: dp_val[i][h] and move[i][h] which is either None, 'H', or 'M'.\n\n            Alternatively, we can store the entire path? But we only need the sequence.\n\n            We'll do:\n\n                parent[i][h] = (prev_i, prev_h, move_char)   # but then we need to store the entire path backwards.\n\n            But note: we only need the sequence of moves. We can build the sequence from the end.\n\n            Steps for backtracking:\n\n                i = 2n, h = n\n                sequence = []   # we'll build from the last move to the first.\n\n                while i > 0:\n                    if we came from (i-1, h-1) by assigning the digit at i-1 (which is A[i-1]) to H, then we mark that move as 'H'\n                    else if we came from (i-1, h) by assigning the digit at i-1 to M, then we mark that move as 'M'\n\n                Then reverse the sequence.\n\n            But how to know from which state we came? \n\n            We can store:\n\n                dp[i][h] = (value, prev_i, prev_h, move_char)\n\n            Then:\n\n                i = 2n, h = n\n                seq = []\n                while i > 0:\n                    if we came from (prev_i, prev_h) and the move was 'H', then append 'H'\n                    else if from 'M', append 'M'\n\n                Then reverse.\n\n            How to store the parent information? We can do:\n\n                Let parent[i][h] = (p_i, p_h, move_char)\n\n            Then we update:\n\n                if we assign the i-th digit (0-indexed, but our dp index is from 0 to 2n) to H, then we come from (i-1, h-1) and the move is 'H'\n\n                if we assign to M, then we come from (i-1, h) and the move is 'M'\n\n            Then we can set:\n\n                parent[i][h] = (i-1, h-1, 'H')   for the H branch\n                parent[i][h] = (i-1, h, 'M')       for the M branch\n\n            But note: we are updating dp[i][h] from two directions. We need to know which one we actually took.\n\n            Alternatively, we can store the entire dp table and then for the final state, we know that the last move must be either H or M, and then we can check which one is valid and which one leads to the maximum.\n\n            However, we are doing a DP that stores the maximum value. Then we can reconstruct by:\n\n                Start from (2n, n) and then:\n\n                Let last_digit_index = 2n-1 (the last digit is at index 2n-1)\n\n                If dp[2n][n] was achieved by an assignment to H at the last digit, then the last move is 'H', and the previous state is (2n-1, n-1). Otherwise, it's 'M' and previous state (2n-1, n).\n\n                Then we continue.\n\n            How to know if the last move was H or M? \n\n            We can store an additional table: choice[i][h] = which move was taken at state (i, h) to get to (i+1, ...)?\n\n            Actually, we can store:\n\n                dp[i][h] = maximum value at state (i, h)\n\n                Then we can store:\n\n                from_H[i][h] = True/False   (if the last move was H, then we came from (i-1, h-1) and the value is dp[i][h] = dp[i-1][h-1] + value_H)\n\n                Similarly, from_M[i][h] = True/False.\n\n            But then we can backtrack by:\n\n                i = 2n, h = n\n                seq = []\n                while i > 0:\n                    if from_H[i][h] is True:\n                        then the move at digit i-1 was 'H'\n                        i, h = i-1, h-1\n                    elif from_M[i][h] is True:\n                        then the move at digit i-1 was 'M'\n                        i, h = i-1, h\n\n            However, we must know the condition for H: we can only assign to H if h>0 (i.e., we are at state (i, h) and h>=1). Similarly for M: we can only assign to M if the current M count (i-h) < n, i.e., i-h < n.\n\n            But wait, the state (i, h) is the result of processing i digits. The last move was at digit i-1.\n\n            Actually, we can store:\n\n                Let dp[i][h] = maximum total value for the first i digits, with h digits assigned to H.\n\n                Then the last move (the i-th digit, 0-indexed the i-th digit is the one at index i-1) was:\n\n                    If we got dp[i][h] from H: then we must have h>=1 and dp[i][h] = dp[i-1][h-",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, in a game where they alternately take digits from a given number A. The goal is to assign exactly n digits to each player such that the sum of the numbers formed by their respective digits is maximized. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves partitioning the digits of a 2n-digit number into two subsequences (each of length n) while preserving their original order. The challenge is to assign digits to each player in such a way that the sum of the numbers formed by these digits is maximized. Each digit's contribution to the total sum depends on its position in the respective player's number, which is determined by the sequence of assignments.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where `dp[i][h]` represents the maximum total value achievable after processing the first `i` digits, with `h` digits assigned to Homer. The remaining `i - h` digits are assigned to Marge. The DP state transitions consider assigning the next digit to either Homer or Marge, updating the count and the total value accordingly.\n\n3. **Exponent Calculation**: For each digit assignment, the value added depends on the digit's position in the respective player's number. The exponent for a digit assigned to Homer is `10^(n-1-h)`, and for Marge, it is `10^(n-1-(i-h))`, where `h` is the current count of digits assigned to Homer and `i-h` is the count for Marge.\n\n4. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the state `(2n, n)` to determine the sequence of moves (Homer or Marge) that led to the maximum total prize. This involves checking whether each digit was assigned to Homer or Marge based on the DP transitions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    total_digits = 2 * n\n\n    dp = [[-1] * (n + 1) for _ in range(total_digits + 1)]\n    parent = [[''] * (n + 1) for _ in range(total_digits + 1)]\n    \n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(total_digits):\n        for h in range(n + 1):\n            if dp[i][h] == -1:\n                continue\n            m = i - h\n            if h < n:\n                exp_val = 10**(n - 1 - h)\n                digit_val = int(A_str[i]) * exp_val\n                new_val = dp[i][h] + digit_val\n                if dp[i + 1][h + 1] < new_val or dp[i + 1][h + 1] == -1:\n                    dp[i + 1][h + 1] = new_val\n                    parent[i + 1][h + 1] = 'H'\n            if m < n:\n                exp_val = 10**(n - 1 - m)\n                digit_val = int(A_str[i]) * exp_val\n                new_val = dp[i][h] + digit_val\n                if dp[i + 1][h] < new_val or dp[i + 1][h] == -1:\n                    dp[i + 1][h] = new_val\n                    parent[i + 1][h] = 'M'\n                    \n    seq = []\n    i, h = total_digits, n\n    while i > 0:\n        move_char = parent[i][h]\n        seq.append(move_char)\n        if move_char == 'H':\n            i -= 1\n            h -= 1\n        else:\n            i -= 1\n            h = h\n            \n    seq.reverse()\n    print(''.join(seq))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for `n` and the number `A`. It initializes a DP table `dp` to store the maximum total value achievable at each state `(i, h)` and a `parent` table to record the last move (Homer or Marge) that led to each state.\n\n2. **DP Table Filling**: The nested loops iterate over each digit position and each possible count of digits assigned to Homer. For each state, it checks if assigning the current digit to Homer or Marge yields a higher total value, updating the DP table and parent table accordingly.\n\n3. **Backtracking**: Starting from the state `(2n, n)`, the code backtracks through the parent table to reconstruct the sequence of moves (H or M) that maximizes the total prize. The sequence is built in reverse order and then reversed to produce the final answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible ways to split the digits between the two players using dynamic programming and backtracking, ensuring the optimal solution is found without resorting to brute-force methods.",
