Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to process the queries in reverse order because the later replacements might affect the earlier ones (e.g., if a digit is replaced by a string that contains digits to be replaced again). However, note that the problem says: \"the queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed\". \n\n But note: if we do the replacements from left to right, then replacing '2' with '00' and then '3' with '' in the example, we get the correct result. However, consider if a replacement produces a digit that is then replaced by a subsequent query? Actually, the problem says: \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\", meaning that each query replaces every occurrence of the digit.\n\n However, the challenge is that if we do the replacements in the given order, then the next query might see the modified string. But note: the problem states that the queries are applied one after the other. So the first query transforms the entire string, then the second query is applied on the transformed string.\n\n But what if a replacement in an earlier query produces a digit that appears in a later query? Then the later query will replace that digit. Therefore, we cannot simply apply the queries in the given order without modifying the string at each step, which could be inefficient because the string might become very long.\n\n However, note the constraint: the total length of all ti's is up to 10^5, and the initial string s has length up to 10^5. But the problem says: \"The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5\", meaning that even though we have up to 10^5 queries, the total amount of replacement strings is bounded.\n\n But the catch: if we do the replacements naively (by scanning the entire string for each query), and the string becomes long, then the complexity would be too high.\n\n Alternative approach: dynamic programming or processing the queries backwards.\n\n Observation: Each query is about replacing a single digit (from '0' to '9') with a string. The key is that the same digit might be replaced multiple times, but note that the replacement is done for the current state of the string.\n\n We can think of the process as: starting with the original string, then for each query (from first to last) we replace every occurrence of the digit (say d) with the string t. However, if we try to simulate this by building the entire string, the string length might blow up (exponentially?).\n\n But note: the total length of all ti's is 10^5, but the initial string is 10^5 and each query might replace a digit that appears many times. However, the total length of the final string might be huge (like 10^5 * (average expansion factor) and the average expansion factor could be large if we have many replacements.\n\n However, note the constraints: the total length of the replacement strings (ti) for all queries is 10^5. But the problem does not restrict the total length of the resulting string. We cannot build the entire string if it becomes too long.\n\n We must compute the number modulo 1000000007. We don't need the actual string.\n\n Let's consider representing the transformation for each digit. We can use a DP-like state for each digit: what is the value (mod 1000000007) and the length (for shifting) contributed by each digit?\n\n Alternatively, we can process the queries in reverse order and use memoization to avoid redundant replacements.\n\n Insight: Instead of doing the replacements in the given order, we can do them in reverse. Then, we start from the final set of queries and go backwards to the initial string.\n\n However, the problem is that the queries are applied sequentially. We can define:\n\n Let F(s) be the resulting string after processing all queries.\n\n We want to compute the number mod 1000000007.\n\n We can use a transformation for each digit. Let's define for each digit d, a function that maps a substring (or rather, the contribution of the digit) to the substring after all replacements.\n\n But note: the replacement for a digit d is given by a string ti, and then the subsequent queries will replace the digits in ti. So the effect of a query is to replace d by ti, and then let the subsequent queries act on ti.\n\n How about processing the queries from last to first, and for each digit, we store the transformation (a tuple (value, length)) for that digit, where:\n   - value: the numeric value (mod 1000000007) that the digit contributes.\n   - length: the length of the string that the digit is expanded to.\n\n Then, when processing a query \"d -> t\", we break t into its digits, and for each",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing each occurrence of a specific digit with a specified substring. The final transformed string is then interpreted as a decimal number, and we need to compute its remainder when divided by 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the transformations without explicitly constructing the potentially very large intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing each query in the given order, we process them in reverse. This allows us to handle each digit's transformation once, considering all subsequent queries that might modify the replacement strings.\n2. **Digit Transformation Tracking**: For each digit (0-9), maintain two values:\n   - **Value (val)**: The numeric value contributed by the digit after all transformations, modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length (len)**: The total length of the string the digit expands to after all transformations.\n3. **Efficient Updates**: For each query, update the digit's transformation by replacing it with the specified substring, but using the already processed transformations for any digits present in the substring. This ensures that each digit's final contribution is computed only once, leveraging the reverse processing order.\n4. **Modulo Handling**: Since the numbers can be very large, all operations are performed modulo 1000000007 to prevent overflow and ensure correctness.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries.append(input().strip())\n    \n    val = [0] * 10\n    length = [0] * 10\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        if i == 0:\n            val[i] = 0\n            length[i] = 1\n        else:\n            val[i] = i\n            length[i] = 1\n\n    for q in reversed(queries):\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        d_char = parts[0]\n        t_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        d_digit = int(d_char)\n        new_val = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        \n        for char in t_str:\n            digit = int(char)\n            new_val = (new_val * length[digit] + val[digit]) % MOD\n            new_len = (new_len + length[digit]) % (MOD-1)\n        \n        val[d_digit] = new_val\n        length[d_digit] = new_len\n\n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        digit = int(char)\n        result = (result * length[digit] + val[digit]) % MOD\n        \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial values for each digit (0-9) are set. Digits initially contribute their own value (e.g., digit '5' contributes 5) and a length of 1 (since they represent a single character).\n2. **Reverse Query Processing**: Each query is processed in reverse order. For a query that replaces digit `d` with string `t`, the code calculates the combined value and length contributions of `t` after all subsequent transformations. This involves breaking down `t` into individual digits, and for each digit, using its precomputed value and length (from later queries) to determine the overall effect of the replacement.\n3. **Result Calculation**: After processing all queries, the initial string `s` is transformed by replacing each digit with its final value and length. The result is computed by iterating over each character in `s`, multiplying the current result by the length contribution of the digit, and adding the digit's value, all modulo 1000000007.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the transformations without explicitly constructing large intermediate strings, leveraging reverse processing and modular arithmetic to ensure correctness and performance.",
