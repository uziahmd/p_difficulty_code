Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We can swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2'. This means that:\n - '0' can move leftwards past '1's (but not past '2's, because we cannot swap '0' and '2')\n - '2' can move leftwards past '1's (but not past '0's)\n\n However, note that we can also have swaps between two different pairs: \n   Operation 1: Swap \"01\" <-> \"10\"\n   Operation 2: Swap \"12\" <-> \"21\"\n\n Therefore, we can think of the following:\n\n Since we can swap adjacent '0' and '1', and adjacent '1' and '2', then:\n   - A '0' can pass through a sequence of '1's (because each time we swap '0' and '1', the '0' moves left until it hits a non-'1').\n   - Similarly, a '2' can pass through a sequence of '1's (swapping with each '1').\n\n But note: a '0' cannot pass through a '2' because we cannot swap '0' and '2'. Similarly, a '2' cannot pass through a '0'.\n\n Therefore, the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed? Actually, no. Consider:\n\n Example: \"02\" -> cannot be swapped to \"20\", so the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain the same as in the original string.\n\n However, wait: what if we have multiple characters? Let's break down the allowed swaps:\n\n We can swap:\n   \"01\" -> \"10\"\n   \"10\" -> \"01\"\n   \"12\" -> \"21\"\n   \"21\" -> \"12\"\n\n So the only restrictions are:\n   - '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly.\n   - But note: if there is a '1' between them, can they cross?\n\n Actually, consider: \"012\". \n   We can do: \n        \"012\" -> swap first two: \"102\", then swap last two: \"120\" -> but wait, from \"102\" we can swap the last two to get \"120\", but then we have \"0\" and \"2\" adjacent? However, we cannot swap \"02\" or \"20\". \n\n In fact, the key observation is that the relative order of the '0's and the '2's must remain the same as in the original string because they cannot cross each other (unless separated by ones). But note: \n\n Example: \"0\" and \"2\" with a '1' in between: \"012\"\n   We can transform \"012\" to \"102\" (swap the first two) and then \"102\" to \"120\" (swap the last two). Now we have \"120\", which is lexicographically less than the original.\n\n However, in \"120\": the '0' is after the '2'. But originally the '0' was before the '2'. So the relative order of '0' and '2' changed.\n\n What happened? The '0' moved past the '2' by using the '1' in the middle. \n\n Actually, let's break down the moves for \"012\":\n   Step1: swap the first two (0 and 1): becomes \"102\"\n   Step2: swap the last two (1 and 2): becomes \"120\"\n\n Now, in the final string, the '0' is at the end and the '2' is in the middle. So the relative order of the '0' and the '2' has changed.\n\n But wait: how did the '0' move past the '2'? It went from being at index0 to index2, and the '2' went from index2 to index1. They crossed.\n\n However, note: the operation is only allowed on adjacent elements. And we did two swaps. But the problem is: we are allowed to swap any two adjacent characters that are either \"01\" or \"12\". \n\n The catch: the '0' and '2' are separated by a '1'. The '0' first swapped with the '1', and then the '1' swapped with the '2'. So the '0' effectively moved two steps to the right, and the '2' one step to the left.\n\n But note: the relative order of the entire set of zeros and twos is not preserved. \n\n Let me try to think of an invariant. Actually, the operations allow swapping of:\n   - Between '0' and '1': so the zeros and ones can be rearranged arbitrarily as long as the zeros and ones form a contiguous",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing a series of adjacent swaps on the given ternary string. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The key observation here is that the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain the same as in the original string because they cannot be swapped directly. However, '1's can move freely between '0's and '2's, allowing them to separate or reorder '0's and '2's indirectly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires transforming the input string into its lexicographically smallest form using specific adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. This means '0's can move left past '1's, and '2's can move left past '1's, but '0's and '2's cannot swap places directly.\n2. **Insight**: The relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string must be preserved in any transformation. However, '1's can be used to facilitate the movement of '0's and '2's past each other. This means we can separate all '0's to the left, followed by '1's, and then '2's, but with the constraint that the sequence of '0's and '2's must match their original order.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves:\n   - Separating the original string into three lists: one for each character ('0', '1', '2').\n   - The positions of '0's and '2's are fixed relative to each other, so we need to interleave them while maintaining their original order. The '1's can be placed wherever they fit lexicographically smallest, but they must not disrupt the order of '0's and '2's.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes the string in linear time, making two passes (one to separate characters and another to merge them), resulting in an O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string. This is efficient for large inputs up to 10^5 characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append(char)\n        elif char == '1':\n            ones.append(char)\n        else:\n            twos.append(char)\n            \n    merged = []\n    i, j, k = 0, 0, 0\n    n = len(zeros) + len(ones) + len(twos)\n    \n    while i < len(zeros) and j < len(twos):\n        if zeros[i] < twos[j]:\n            merged.append(zeros[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(twos[j])\n            j += 1\n            \n    while i < len(zeros):\n        merged.append(zeros[i])\n        i += 1\n        \n    while j < len(twos):\n        merged.append(twos[j])\n        j +=  minimum_possible_ternary_string.py\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input string is read and split into three separate lists based on the characters '0', '1', and '2'.\n- **Merging Process**: The algorithm merges the '0's and '2's lists by comparing elements and appending the smaller one first. This ensures that all '0's come before '2's in the result, maintaining their original relative order.
