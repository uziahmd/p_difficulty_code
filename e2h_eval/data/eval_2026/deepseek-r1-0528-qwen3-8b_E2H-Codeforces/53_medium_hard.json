    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a more straightforward method.\n Since the string is short, we can try all possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (which is n//2) down to 1 and check for duplicates.\n\n However, note: The problem says occurrences can overlap. So we are looking for two (or more) occurrences of a substring that may overlap.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. Let n = len(string). The maximum length of a substring that can appear at least twice is at most floor(n/2) + something? Actually, if we have overlapping, then we can have two occurrences of a substring of length L, and the two occurrences must start at positions i and j (with i < j) such that j - i < L (for overlapping). But note: the problem does not require non-overlapping.\n\n However, note: the longest repeated substring in a string (allowing overlaps) is a classic problem. One way is to consider all substrings and check for duplicates.\n\n But since n is at most 100, we can do:\n\n Approach:\n We can iterate over all possible substring lengths from the maximum (which is n-1) down to 1, and for each length, check every substring of that length and record the frequency.\n\n However, we want the longest substring that appears at least twice. So we can do:\n\n For length L from min(n, 50) down to 1? Actually, the maximum L for which there can be two occurrences is floor((n+1)/2) ? Not exactly.\n\n But note: even with overlapping, the two occurrences must start at different indices and the entire substring must match. The maximum length L for which two occurrences can exist is when we have two occurrences that are adjacent (like \"aaa\" has two occurrences of \"aa\": at index0 and index1). In fact, the maximum length L is such that there exists two starting indices i and j (with i < j) such that j-i >= L (but wait, actually for overlapping, the condition is j-i < L? Actually, no: if we have two occurrences that overlap, then the second occurrence starts before the first one ends. But note: we don't require non-overlapping. The condition is just that the substring appears at least twice.\n\n Actually, the maximum length L for which a substring can appear twice is floor(n/2) + ... but consider: \n Example: \"aaaa\" -> the substring \"aaa\" appears at index0 and index1. So maximum L for which we can have two occurrences is 3 (in a string of length 4). \n\n However, we are iterating from large L to small, so we can break early when we find a duplicate.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let s = input string, n = len(s)\n\n We'll consider substring length from min(n, 50) down to 1? Actually, the maximum L is n-1 (if the string is \"aaa\", then \"aa\" is length 2, which is n-1). But wait, we need two occurrences. The maximum L for which two occurrences are possible is floor((n+1)/2) * ? \n\n Actually, we can have two occurrences of a substring of length L if the string has at least two consecutive blocks of that substring. The minimal condition is that the string length must be at least L + L - (overlap). But we don't know the overlap. However, we can simply check for all L from min(n, ...) down to 1.\n\n But note: the problem says the string length is at most 100, so we can check for L from n down to 1, but wait: if we check from n down to 1, then we are checking the whole string first. The whole string can only appear once (unless the string is periodic and the whole string is repeated, but then we would have a substring of length n appearing twice only if the string is of the form \"abcabc\", but then the whole string \"abcabc\" appears only once. Actually, the whole string cannot appear twice because we don't have two copies of the entire string (unless the string is empty). \n\n So we should start from the maximum possible L that can have two occurrences. The maximum L is floor(n/2) + something? Actually, the maximum L is n//2 + (if n is odd, then floor(n/2))? \n\n Actually, consider: the two occurrences must not necessarily be contiguous. But they must be two separate occurrences. The condition for having two occurrences of a substring of length L is that the entire string must have at least two segments of length L. The minimal requirement is that the string has length at least 2*L (if they don't overlap) or even less (if they overlap). But note: the two occurrences can overlap arbitrarily. The minimal total length required for two occurrences of a substring of length L is L + (L - (maximal allowed overlap)). But the maximal allowed overlap is L-1 (so the two occurrences can share L-1 characters). Then the total length needed is L + (L - (L-1)) = L+1. \n\n However, we are given the entire string. We can simply check for each L from 1 up to n, but we want the maximum L that has at least two occurrences.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate L from n down to 1, but if we find a substring of length L that appears at least twice, we output L and return.\n\n But note: the same substring might appear more than twice, but we only need two.\n\n However, we must consider: what is the maximum L? It can be as large as n-1? Actually, no: because if we have a substring of length n-1, then we have two possibilities: \n   s[0:n-1] and s[1:n] \n If these two are equal, then we have a duplicate. Example: \"abcde\": no duplicate for n-1=4. But \"aabba\": \n   substring of length 4: \"aabb\" and \"abba\" -> not the same. \n   substring of length 3: \"aab\", \"abb\", \"bba\" -> no duplicate.\n\n But consider \"aaa\": \n   n=3, substring of length 2: \"aa\" (at index0 and index1) -> duplicate, so answer is 2.\n\n So the maximum L we need to check is from n down to 1. But note: the maximum L for which two occurrences can exist is at most n-1 (because the substring must fit in the string at least twice, and the two occurrences would require two distinct starting indices, and the last starting index must be at least L apart? Actually, no: the two occurrences can be overlapping, so the starting indices can be consecutive. \n\n But note: if we have a substring of length L, then the starting index i must be from 0 to n-L. So we need at least two different starting indices i and j (with i < j) such that j <= n-L. Therefore, we require j - i >= 0 and j <= n-L. The maximum L is such that n-L >= 1 (so that there's at least two starting indices: 0 and 1). Actually, we can have two starting indices as long as n-L >= 1 (so L <= n-1). \n\n Therefore, we can iterate L from min(n, 50) down to 1? Actually, n is at most 100, so we can iterate from n-1 down to 1.\n\n Algorithm:\n\n Let s be the input string, n = len(s)\n\n for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):   # from n-1 down to 1\n   Create a set of all substrings of length L.\n   If the size of the set is less than the total number of substrings (which is n - L + 1), then we have at least one duplicate.\n\n   But wait, we don't need the entire set to be less, we just need to know if there is at least one substring that appears at least twice.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do: for each substring of length L, record if we've seen it. If we see a duplicate, then we break and output L.\n\n   However, we can break as soon as we find one duplicate.\n\n   Steps for fixed L:\n     seen = set()\n     for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n         substr = s[i:i+L]\n         if substr in seen:\n             print(L)\n             exit the program (or break out and then output L)\n         else:\n             seen.add(substr)\n\n   If we finish the loop for L without finding a duplicate, we continue to the next smaller L.\n\n If we don't find any duplicate for any L, then output 0.\n\n However, note: the problem states that the string is non-empty, but it might be that no substring appears twice. Then we output 0.\n\n Example: \"abcd\" -> no duplicate for any L>=1? \n   L=3: substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate.\n   L=2: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> no duplicate.\n   L=1: 'a','b','c','d' -> no duplicate -> output 0.\n\n Example: \"ababa\"\n   We expect output 3.\n\n   Check for L=4: \n        substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n   L=3:\n        \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> we have \"aba\" twice. So output 3.\n\n Example: \"zzz\"\n   L=2: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> duplicate, so output 2.\n\n However, note: the example input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] gives output [0, 3, 2].\n\n But wait, the example input is given as three separate strings? Actually, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" So we are reading one string per run.\n\n Correction: the problem says the first input line contains the string. So we are reading one string.\n\n However, the example is given as:\n   Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n   Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n This means the sample tests are three separate test cases. But the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" meaning one string per execution.\n\n But wait, the problem is competitive programming and sometimes they give multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" and the example is given in a list. \n\n Looking again: the problem says \"Input\" and then the example is provided as a list of strings. But the problem does not specify multiple test cases. \n\n Clarification from the problem: \n   \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n So we assume one string per run.\n\n However, the example output is given as a list. \n\n Since the problem says \"Output one number\", we output one number per test case.\n\n But wait, the example input is given as three strings. How are we going to handle that?\n\n Actually, the problem says \"You're given a string\", so we read one string.\n\n But the example input is shown as:\n\n   Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n This might be a representation of multiple test cases. However, the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n After re-reading: \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular). So we are to read one string.\n\n But then the example input is three strings. \n\n I think the example input is just showing three examples. In the actual competition, the input would be one string per test case.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output.\"\n\n And note: the example input is given in a list, but the problem says the first input line. \n\n Since the problem does not specify the number of test cases, we assume one test case per run.\n\n But wait, the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the problem. \n\n In many problems, they provide multiple test cases. However, the input format here says \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n So let me read the problem statement again: it says \"Input\" and then the first line contains the string.\n\n Therefore, we read one string.\n\n However, the example output is given as a list of answers. \n\n How should we handle this? \n\n There are two possibilities:\n\n 1. The problem expects multiple test cases, and the input is a file containing multiple strings (each on its own line) and we must output the answer for each.\n\n 2. Or the example was just illustrative and the problem is for one string.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, and the sample input is given as a list of strings, but the input format says \"The first input line\", we can assume that the input is one string per execution.\n\n But wait, the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and then the input description. \n\n In competitive programming, sometimes they have multiple test cases. The problem says \"The first input line\", which implies that the first line is the string. But then what about the rest? \n\n Actually, the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" and then nothing else. So we assume one string.\n\n However, the example input is given as a list of three strings. \n\n Let me check the constraints: the string length is at most 100, and non-empty.\n\n I think the example is just showing three different examples. \n\n But the problem says: \"Output one number\".\n\n So if we are to write a program that reads one string and outputs one number, then we do:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n\n Then process s.\n\n But the example input is three strings. \n\n This discrepancy suggests that the problem might be intended for multiple test cases, but the description is ambiguous.\n\n Since the problem says \"The first input line\", we can assume one test case.\n\n However, the example input is provided in a list, and the expected output is also a list.\n\n Clarification from the problem author: not available.\n\n Given the ambiguity, let's look at the sample tests:\n\n   Input: \"abcd\" -> Output: 0\n   Input: \"ababa\" -> Output: 3\n   Input: \"zzz\" -> Output: 2\n\n So if we are to write a program that reads multiple test cases, we would read until EOF. But the problem says the first input line.\n\n Another possibility: the input is one string, but the example shows multiple test cases for clarity.\n\n Since the problem is stated for one string, we'll assume one test case.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2)\".\n\n Sample test 2 is \"ababa\", which returns 3.\n\n Therefore, we code for one test case.\n\n Steps:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n\n   n = len(s)\n\n   # If the string is empty, output 0. But guaranteed non-empty.\n\n   # We are going to check for L from n-1 down to 1.\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)   # or break and then we can break out of two loops.\n            else:\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n   # If we didn't find any duplicate, output 0.\n\n   print(0)\n\n However, we can optimize: if we find a duplicate, we output the current L and break. Otherwise, we continue to the next L.\n\n But note: we are iterating from the largest L (n-1) downward. The first duplicate we find is the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n Example: \"zzz\": \n   n=3, so we check L=2: \n        substrings: s[0:2]=\"zz\", s[1:3]=\"zz\". When we see \"zz\" the second time, we output 2.\n\n Example: \"ababa\":\n   n=5, check L=4: substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n   L=3: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> duplicate at the third substring (the first two are \"aba\" and \"bab\", then the third is \"aba\" which is already seen). So output 3.\n\n Example: \"abcd\": \n   L=3: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate.\n   L=2: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> no duplicate.\n   L=1: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicate -> output 0.\n\n But wait, what about the substring \"aa\" in \"aaa\"? \n   s = \"aaa\", n=3, check L=2: \n        \"aa\" (from index0) and then \"aa\" (from index1) -> duplicate, output 2.\n\n However, what about the substring \"a\" in \"aaa\"? It appears three times, but we are looking for the longest, so 2 is longer than 1.\n\n This matches.\n\n But note: the problem says the occurrences can overlap, and our method considers all occurrences (including overlapping ones) because we are taking every substring.\n\n However, we are storing every substring of length L and checking for duplicates. This includes overlapping ones.\n\n But what if the string is \"abcabc\"? \n   We are looking for the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n   Entire string: \"abcabc\" (length6) -> only one occurrence (from index0 to index5) and then the next occurrence would start at index3? But then the substring from index3 is \"abc\", but we are checking for length6: only one substring of length6: \"abcabc\". So no duplicate for L=6.\n\n   Then check L=5: \n        \"abcab\", \"bcabc\" -> no duplicate.\n\n   L=4: \n        \"abca\", \"bcab\", \"cabc\" -> no duplicate.\n\n   L=3:\n        \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", \"abc\" -> duplicate: \"abc\" appears twice.\n\n   So output 3.\n\n But wait, the string \"abcabc\" has the substring \"abc\" appearing twice (at index0 and index3). \n\n However, note: the substring \"abc\" at index0 and index3: they are not overlapping? Actually, they are separated by one character. But the problem allows overlapping, so we don't care. \n\n But note: our method checks all substrings, including those that are separated. \n\n However, we must note: the problem does not require the two occurrences to be consecutive. \n\n Therefore, the above algorithm works.\n\n But note: the worst-case string is one that has no repeated substring until very small L. Then we do:\n\n   For L from n-1 down to 1, we generate n - L + 1 substrings, and each substring has length L.\n\n   The total work is sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n - L + 1)*L.\n\n   Since n <= 100, the maximum n is 100, so the worst-case is:\n\n      L from 99 down to 1: \n        For L=99: 100-99+1 = 2 substrings, each of length 99 -> 2*99 = 198 comparisons (each comparison is a string of length 99, so O(99) for each comparison, and we do 2 comparisons: 2*99 = 198 operations for L=99).\n        Then L=98: 3 substrings, each 98 -> 3*98 = 294 operations (each operation is comparing two strings of length 98, but we are building a set and doing lookups. The set will have at most 3 elements, so we do 3 insertions and 3 lookups (each insertion is building a string of length 98, and comparing with existing ones). \n\n   Actually, the inner loop for fixed L is O(n) in terms of the number of substrings, and each substring is of length L, and the set operations (insertion and lookup) are O(L) per operation (because string comparison is O(L)).\n\n   So the total operations for a fixed L is O((n-L+1)*L) and the total over all L is about O(n^3) in the worst-case (since n is 100, the worst-case is about 100^3 = 1e6, which is acceptable).\n\n   But wait, the total operations for one test case is:\n\n      Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1) * (cost of building and checking each substring)\n\n   The cost for one substring is O(L) for building and then O(L) for each comparison in the set (but set uses hashing, so average O(L) for building and then O(L) for the hash computation and comparison). \n\n   However, we are building the set by inserting each substring (which is O(L)) and then checking membership (which is O(L) for the hash and then O(L) for the comparison if there's a collision). \n\n   But note: the total number of substrings for a fixed L is (n-L+1). The total work for fixed L is (n-L+1) * (L + L) = (n-L+1)*L*2? Actually, building a substring of length L is O(L), and then the set lookup is O(L) (because the set uses a hash table and the hash of a string of length L is computed in O(L), and then if there's a collision we do a comparison of two strings of length L, which is O(L)).\n\n   So for fixed L, the work is O((n-L+1) * L). \n\n   Then the overall work is O(n^3) because:\n\n        Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L = Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n*L - L^2 + L) \n\n        = n * Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} L - Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} L^2 + Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} L\n\n        = n * (n-1)*n/2 - (n-1)*n*(2*n-1)/6 + (n-1)*n/2\n\n   But n is 100, so we can compute:\n\n        n=100: \n          Sum_{L=1}^{99} L = 99*100/2 = 4950\n          Sum_{L=1}^{99} L^2 = 99*100*199/6 = 328350\n\n        Then the total operations (without considering the constant factors) is about 100*4950 - 328350 + 4950 = 495000 - 328350 + 4950 = 495000 - 328350 = 166650 + 4950 = 171600.\n\n   Since each operation (building a substring and comparing) is O(L), and L goes from 1 to 99, the total operations is the sum over L of (n-L+1)*L^2 (if we consider that each substring operation is O(L) and we do two operations per substring: building and then set lookup). \n\n   Actually, the building is O(L) and the set lookup is O(L) (because the set uses hashing and then worst-case comparison). \n\n   So the total operations is O( (n-L+1) * L^2 ) for each L.\n\n   Then the overall complexity is O(n^4) because:\n\n        Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1) * L^2 \n\n        = Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n*L^2 - L^3 + L^2)\n\n        = n * Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} L^2 - Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} L^3 + Sum_{L=1}^{n-1} L^2\n\n        = (n+1) * (n-1)*n*(2*n-1)/6 - ( (n-1)^2 * n^2 )/4 + (n-1)*n*(2*n-1)/6\n\n   For n=100, this is acceptable because 100^4 is 100000000, but wait, we are summing over L from 1 to 99, and the term (n-L+1)*L^2 is about 100 * L^2, and then we sum L^2 from 1 to 99 (which is about 328350) and then multiplied by 100? Actually, no: the expression is:\n\n        n * (sum of squares) + (sum of squares) - (sum of cubes)\n\n        = 100 * 328350 + 328350 - (sum_{L=1}^{99} L^3)\n\n        The sum of cubes for L=1 to 99 is (99*100/2)^2 = (4950)^2 = 24502500.\n\n        Then total operations = 100 * 328350 + 328350 - 24502500 = 32835000 + 328350 - 24502500 = 33163350 - 24502500 = 8660850.\n\n   That is about 8.6 million operations (each operation being a character comparison of length L). \n\n   But note: the actual operation for building a substring of length L is L (copy characters) and then the set lookup is O(L) (hashing and then possibly comparing two strings of length L). \n\n   However, 8.6 million operations is acceptable for n=100 because 8.6e6 is acceptable in Python for a single test case.\n\n   But note: the worst-case n is 100, and the inner loop for a fixed L runs (n-L+1) times, and for each we do:\n\n        substring = s[i:i+L]   -> this creates a new string of length L, which is O(L) time and space.\n\n        then check if that substring is in the set -> which involves hashing the string (O(L)) and then if there's a hash collision, comparing two strings (each of length L) which is O(L).\n\n   So the total time is O( (n-L+1) * L^2 ) for fixed L, and then summed over L.\n\n   But 8.6 million operations (each operation being a character copy and then a character-by-character comparison) is acceptable for n=100.\n\n   However, we can optimize by using a dictionary (set) that stores the substrings and their frequency? Actually, we don't need frequency, just presence. \n\n   But we are breaking as soon as we find a duplicate. So we might not have to build the entire set for a given L if we find a duplicate earlier.\n\n   The worst-case is when there's no duplicate until L=1, so we do the full set for each L until we get to L=1.\n\n   But worst-case (like a string with all distinct substrings) is rare. For example, a random string of 100 characters from 26 letters is very likely to have repeated substrings? Actually, for L=2, there are 26^2=676 possible substrings, and we have 99 substrings (if n=100) of length2, so by the pigeonhole principle, there must be duplicates for L=2.\n\n   Actually, the problem says the string consists of lower-case Latin letters (26 letters). Then for L=2, the number of distinct substrings is at most 26^2=676, but we have 99 substrings (if n=100) so no guarantee. Actually, 99 < 676, so it is possible to have no duplicate for L=2.\n\n   Example: a string of 100 distinct bigrams? Actually, the bigrams must be consecutive. But the alphabet is 26, so we can have at most 26^2 distinct bigrams. \n\n   However, the string is of length 100, so we have 99 bigrams. Since 99 < 676, it is possible to have no duplicate for L=2.\n\n   But then for L=1, we have 100 unigrams, and there are only 26, so by the pigeonhole principle, there must be duplicates for L=1.\n\n   Therefore, the worst-case is that we have to check until L=1, but then we break at L=1 because we'll find a duplicate.\n\n   Actually, the minimal L we check is 1, and we break at L=1.\n\n   However, we are iterating from the largest L (n-1) downward. We break at the first duplicate we find.\n\n   But worst-case (no duplicate until L=1) we do:\n\n        L from n-1 down to 2: no duplicate, then at L=1 we find a duplicate.\n\n        The total work is the sum_{L=n-1}^{2} (n-L+1)*L^2 + (number of substrings for L=1)*1^2\n\n        The number of substrings for L=1 is n (100) and each is 1 character, so 100*1 = 100 operations.\n\n        The sum_{L=2}^{99} (n-L+1)*L^2 is the same as above but from 2 to 99, which is about 8.6 million minus the part for L=1 (which is 100) and the part for L=0 (none) and the part for L=n (none). Actually, we didn't include L=n, but we start at n-1.\n\n   Actually, the worst-case (no duplicate until L=1) is still acceptable because the total operations is about 8.6 million (for n=100) which is acceptable in Python.\n\n   But wait, the worst-case (n=100) requires about 8.6 million operations (each operation is copying a substring and then hashing and comparing). \n\n   We can try to optimize by not building the entire substring if we can avoid it. However, the problem says the string is at most 100, so we can use this method.\n\n   However, we can also use a different approach: \n\n   We are only interested in the longest substring that appears at least twice. \n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   Use a dictionary to store all substrings and their starting indices (or just the set of starting indices) for each substring. But then we have to consider all lengths.\n\n   But the above method is straightforward.\n\n   Let me code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem says the string length is at most 100, so we can do the above.\n\n   However, we can break early in the inner loop if we find a duplicate. \n\n   Revised for fixed L:\n\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)   # or break and then break the outer loop too.\n            else:\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n   But we can also break the inner loop early if we found a duplicate.\n\n   However, we break the entire program after printing the answer.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Edge: if the string is empty, but the problem says non-empty.\n\n   Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # We'll iterate L from n-1 down to 1\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                else:\n                    seen.add(substr)\n        print(0)\n\n   However, we can use a flag to break the outer loop.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if ans != 0:\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n   But wait, if we break the inner loop, we then break the outer loop.\n\n   However, we can use:\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    return   # but we are not in a function.\n\n   So we can use:\n\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        else:\n            print(0)\n\n   But wait, the else clause of the for loop is executed if we didn't break. Then we print 0.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                seen.add(substr)\n        print(0)\n\n   This is simpler.\n\n   But note: we are exiting the program as soon as we find one. The problem says output one number.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Output one number\", and then we are done.\n\n   But the problem does not say that there is only one test case. \n\n   Wait, the problem says the first input line contains the string. So we are reading one string.\n\n   But the example input is three strings. \n\n   I think the example input is provided as three separate inputs (three runs). \n\n   Therefore, we output the answer for the given string.\n\n   However, the problem statement says \"The first input line\", so we assume one test case.\n\n   But what if the input has multiple lines? The problem says \"The first input line\", so the rest of the lines are not provided.\n\n   So we read one line.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string is of length 1, then the maximum L is 0 (because n-1=0, so we skip the loop and output 0). \n        # But the problem says non-empty, so minimum length is 1.\n\n        # We'll iterate L from n-1 down to 1.\n\n        # However, if n==1, then the loop runs from 0 to 0 (since range(n-1,0,-1) is range(0,0,-1) which is empty). Then we output 0.\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                seen.add(substr)\n        print(0)\n\n   Let's test with n=1: \n        s = \"a\", then n=1, loop L from 0 down to 1 (step -1) -> doesn't run, then print 0.\n\n   Test with n=2: \n        s = \"aa\", then L from 1 down to 1.\n        i from 0 to 1 (two substrings: \"a\", \"a\")\n        When i=0: substr=\"a\", not in seen -> add to seen.\n        i=1: substr=\"a\", in seen -> print 1.\n\n   But wait, the longest substring that appears at least twice in \"aa\" is \"a\", which has length 1.\n\n   However, is there a longer one? The entire string is \"aa\", which appears only once. So 1 is correct.\n\n   But wait, the substring \"a\" appears twice. \n\n   But note: the substring \"aa\" (length2) appears only once. \n\n   So the above code is correct.\n\n   However, the problem says the string is non-empty, so n>=1.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   But wait, what if the string is \"aabbcc\"? \n        We are looking for the longest repeated substring.\n\n        The longest repeated substring in \"aabbcc\" is \"aa\", \"bb\", \"cc\", each of length2. So the answer is 2.\n\n        Let's run:\n\n            n=6, so we check L=5: \n                substrings: \"aabbcc\", \"abbcc\" -> no duplicate.\n           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, and the string consists of lowercase Latin letters. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters that repeats at least once in the string. The solution involves checking all possible substrings of decreasing lengths from the largest possible down to the smallest until a duplicate is found.\n2. **Intuition**: By starting with the largest possible substring length and decrementing, we can efficiently find the longest repeating substring without having to check all possible combinations. For each length, we generate all substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, its length is the answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it checks all substrings of that length. If any substring is found more than once, the current length is returned immediately as the result. If no duplicates are found for any length, the result is 0.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3), where n is the length of the string. This is because for each possible substring length (up to n-1), we generate and compare up to O(n) substrings, each of length O(L). However, given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit(0)\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initialization**: The length of the string is stored in variable `n`.\n3. **Iterating Over Substring Lengths**: The loop starts from the largest possible substring length (n-1) down to 1. For each length `L`, it initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of encountered substrings.\n4. **Checking Substrings**: For each starting index `i` from 0 to `n - L`, the substring of length `L` starting at `i` is generated. If this substring is already in the set `seen`, its length `L` is printed, and the program exits. Otherwise, the substring is added to the set.\n5. **Output Result**: If no duplicate substrings are found after checking all lengths, the program prints 0, indicating no repeating substrings were found.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination upon finding the longest valid substring, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
