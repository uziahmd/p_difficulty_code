He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by dynamic programming.\n\n Observation:\n Since the problems must be solved in order, we can only break the list of problems into contiguous segments (each day being a contiguous segment from the start).\n\n The total profit is the sum of the maximums of each contiguous segment.\n\n We wish to maximize the total profit. Note that if we break the list into k days, then we have k-1 breaks.\n\n However, note that the problem constraints are n, k <= 2000, so we can use O(n^2) or better.\n\n Idea:\n Let dp[i][j] be the maximum total profit we can get by solving the first i problems in j days.\n Then, for the last day (the j-th day) we consider breaking at some point: \n   dp[i][j] = max_{p from 0 to i-1} { dp[p][j-1] + max(a[p+1..i]) }\n\n But note: the entire segment from p+1 to i must be contiguous and we cannot skip any problem.\n\n However, the challenge is that the max of the segment [p+1, i] is needed. We can precompute the maximums for all segments? \n But note: the array is fixed and we are moving i and p. Alternatively, we can compute the maximum for the segment [l, r] as we extend the segment.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   dp[0][0] = 0\n   For i from 1 to n: \n        dp[i][1] = max(a[0:i])   # because the whole segment is from 0 to i-1\n\n   Then for j from 2 to k:\n        for i from j to n:   # because we need at least j problems to form j days\n            dp[i][j] = max_{x from j-1 to i-1} { dp[x][j-1] + max_segment(x, i-1) }\n\n But the inner max_segment function for a segment [x, i-1] can be computed with a segment tree or with a DP that remembers the maximums?\n\n However, note that we can also use a two-pointer method to update the maximum for the current segment.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the maximums for all contiguous segments ending at i? Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let M(i, j) = max(a[i], a[i+1], ... , a[j])\n\n We can precompute a 2D table for maximums, but that would be O(n^2) and n=2000 -> 4e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we have to be careful.\n\n But note: we are iterating over i and j, and then we iterate x from j-1 to i-1. So the state is i (0..n) and j (1..k). The inner loop for x from j-1 to i-1 is about i - (j-1) iterations, and then for each we compute the maximum for [x, i-1]. \n\n How to compute the maximum for [x, i-1] quickly? We can precompute a 2D table 'max_val' such that:\n   max_val[l][r] = maximum between l and r.\n\n But building a 2D table of size n x n (2000x2000) is 4e6 integers, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we might want to avoid if we do nested loops. Alternatively, we can use a smarter way.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a different approach: let's fix the segment [x, i-1] and then use a precomputed next greater element to know the maximums? \n\n However, note: we are already iterating i and j. We can precompute for each starting index the next greater element to the left? Actually, we can precompute the maximums for all segments ending at i-1 and starting from x (with x from 0 to i-1) using a DP that goes from left to right.\n\n Actually, we can use:\n\n   Let b[i] = the maximum value from the beginning of the segment until i, but wait, we are considering segments that start at x and end at i-1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Let seg_max[x][i] = maximum from x to i. We can compute this with a simple DP:\n\n        seg_max[i][i] = a[i]\n        for length from 2 to n:\n            for i from 0 to n-length:\n                seg_max[i][i+length] = max(seg_max[i][i+length-1], a[i+length])\n\n   But that would be O(n^2) and we have n=2000, so the total operations would be about 2000*(2000",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp gets from solving problems over exactly `k` days, where each day he solves a contiguous sequence of problems from the start of his list. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the optimal solution involves breaking the list of problems into `k` contiguous segments such that the sum of the maximum difficulties in each segment is maximized. This resembles a dynamic programming problem where we need to partition the array into `k` parts, each part contributing its maximum element to the total profit.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We use a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the number of problems solved so far (from the start of the list), and `j` represents the number of days completed. The value `dp[i][j]` stores the maximum total profit achievable by solving the first `i` problems in `j` days.\n\n3. **Base Case**: For the first day (`j = 1`), the profit is simply the maximum difficulty in the first `i` problems.\n\n4. **DP Transition**: For each subsequent day, we consider all possible ways to split the first `i` problems into `j` days. Specifically, for each possible split point `x`, we calculate the profit as `dp[x][j-1] + max(a[x...i-1])`, where `max(a[x...i-1])` is the maximum difficulty in the segment from problem `x` to problem `i-1`.\n\n5. **Efficiency Consideration**: To efficiently compute the maximum values for segments, we precompute a 2D array `max_val` where `max_val[l][r]` holds the maximum value between indices `l` and `r`. This allows us to quickly access the maximum difficulty in any segment during the DP transitions.\n\n6. **Result Extraction**: After filling the DP table, the answer is found in `dp[n][k]`, which gives the maximum total profit. To reconstruct the solution, we backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact segments (number of problems per day) that achieve this profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    max_val = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_val[i][i] = a[i]\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            max_val[i][j] = max(max_val[i][j-1], a[j])\n    \n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][1] = max_val[0][i-1]\n    \n    for days in range(2, k+1):\n        for total_problems in range(days, n+1):\n            best = -1\n            for last_start in range(days-1, total_problems):\n                current_max = max_val[last_start][total_problems-1]\n                candidate = dp[last_start][days-1] + current_max\n                if candidate > best:\n                    best = candidate\n            dp[total_problems][days] = best\n    \n    total_profit = dp[n][k]\n    print(total_profit)\n    \n    res = [0] * k\n    idx = n\n    day_count = k\n    while day_count > 0:\n        temp = -1\n        last_index = idx\n        for i in range(day_count-1, idx):\n            current_max = max_val[i][idx-1]\n            candidate = dp[i][day_count-1] + current_max\n            if candidate == dp[idx][day_count]:\n                temp = i\n                break\n        idx = temp\n        day_count -= 1\n        res[day_count] = idx - (temp) + 1\n    \n    print(\" \".join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of problems `n`, the number of days `k`, and the list of problem difficulties.\n2. **Precomputing Maximums**: The `max_val` array is filled such that `max_val[i][j]` contains the maximum difficulty from problem `i` to problem `j`.\n3. **DP Initialization**: The DP array `dp` is initialized where `dp[i][1]` is the maximum difficulty of the first `i` problems.\n4. **DP Filling**: For each day from 2 to `k`, and for each possible number of problems from that day to `n`, the DP value is updated by considering all possible splits into the previous day's problems plus the maximum difficulty of the current segment.\n5. **Result Extraction**: The maximum profit is found in `dp[n][k]`. Backtracking from this value determines the exact segments (number of problems per day) that achieve this profit, which are then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal solution using dynamic programming and careful precomputation to handle the constraints effectively.",
