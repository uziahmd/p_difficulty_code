Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum value.\n Since the instability is defined as max - min, we can consider:\n  Option 1: Remove the minimum element. Then the new array's min would be the next smallest and max remains the same (unless there are duplicates, but note: if we remove one min and there are multiple mins, then the next min is still the same as the original min? Actually, no: if we remove one occurrence of the min, then the new min is the smallest value that is not removed.\n\n However, note: the array might have duplicates.\n\n Alternate approach:\n  Let's sort the array. Then the entire range is from a[0] to a[-1].\n  Removing an element at index i (in sorted order) will result in two possibilities for the new array's min and max:\n\n  If we remove an element that is not the minimum, then the new min is still a[0].\n  Similarly, if we remove an element that is not the maximum, then the new max is still a[-1].\n\n  But if we remove the minimum, then the new min becomes a[1] (if n>=2). Similarly, if we remove the maximum, the new max becomes a[-2].\n\n  However, we are allowed to remove exactly one element. Therefore, we can consider:\n\n  For each removal, the instability is: \n      (max of the remaining elements) - (min of the remaining elements)\n\n  But note: the remaining array's min and max can be computed from the sorted array.\n\n  We can try to remove each element and compute the instability, but that would be O(n^2) which is too slow for n up to 10^5.\n\n  Insight: The only removals that matter are those that remove either the current global minimum or the global maximum (or perhaps near them). Actually, we can observe:\n\n  After sorting, the entire array is [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}].\n\n  If we remove an element at index i, then:\n      new_min = a0 if i != 0, but if i==0 then new_min = a1 (if n>1)\n      new_max = a_{n-1} if i != n-1, else a_{n-2}\n\n  However, wait: what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? Then the min and max remain the same? Actually, yes. Because the first element is the min and the last is the max. So:\n\n      If we remove an element that is not the first, then the min remains a0.\n      If we remove an element that is not the last, then the max remains a_{n-1}.\n\n  Therefore, the instability after removal of an element at index i is:\n\n      If i == 0: then instability = a_{n-1} - a[1]\n      If i == n-1: then instability = a_{n-2} - a0\n      Otherwise: instability = a_{n-1} - a0   [because both min and max are unchanged]\n\n  But wait, is that correct? Consider an array [1, 2, 3, 4]. Removing the middle element (say 2 or 3) leaves the min and max as 1 and 4, so instability is 3. But if we remove the first element (1) then instability is 4-2=2, and if we remove the last (4) then 3-1=2. So indeed, the removals that are not at the ends don't change the overall min and max.\n\n  However, what about duplicates? Consider [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Removing one of the 1's: \n      Original min=1, max=4.\n      Removing a 1: the new min is still 1 (because there's another 1) and max is 4 -> instability=3.\n      But wait, if we remove the other 1, same thing. However, what if we remove the first element (which is 1) and then the array starts with 1 again? Actually, in sorted array, the two 1's are adjacent.\n\n  Let me reframe: We have sorted the array. Then:\n\n      Removing an element at index i:\n          new_min = a0 if i > 0, but actually if i==0 then we use a1, if i==1 then we use a0 (if we remove a duplicate of the min, then the min remains a0 until we remove all occurrences of the min).\n\n  Correction: The min of the remaining array is the smallest element present. In sorted array, if we remove an element, then the new min is:\n        If we remove the first occurrence (i.e.,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the new min and max after removing any element.\n2. **Consider Edge Cases**: \n   - If the array has only two elements, removing either will result in an array with a single element, making the instability zero.\n   - For larger arrays, the key observation is that removing an element that is not the current minimum or maximum does not change the overall min and max of the array. Thus, the instability remains the same as the original array.\n3. **Evaluate Critical Removals**: \n   - Removing the first element (current minimum) results in a new min being the second element, and the max remains the last element.\n   - Removing the last element (current maximum) results in a new max being the second last element, and the min remains the first element.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Instability**: Compare the instability values obtained from removing the first element, the last element, or any other element (if applicable) and choose the smallest value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    arr.sort()\n    original_instability = arr[-1] - arr[0]\n    \n    candidate1 = arr[-1] - arr[1]\n    candidate2 = arr[-2] - arr[0]\n    \n    if original_instability == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        answer = min(original_instability, candidate1, candidate2)\n        print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has exactly two elements, removing any one will leave a single-element array with zero instability.\n3. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum elements.\n4. **Instability Calculation**: \n   - The original instability is calculated as the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.\n   - Two candidate instabilities are considered: one where the first element is removed (new instability is last element minus second element) and another where the last element is removed (new instability is second last element minus first element).\n5. **Result Determination**: The minimum among the original instability and the two candidate instabilities is printed as the result. This ensures the optimal solution is found efficiently.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking a few critical cases, leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic to determine the minimal instability achievable by removing one element.",
