In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles as input. The input is one line containing three strings, but note the example input format: \n Example: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] -> Actually, wait, the example input is given as three separate examples.\n\n However, the problem says: \"The only line contains three strings\" — meaning one line with three space-separated strings? Or one string that has three representations?\n\n Looking at the example: \n   Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the example input is shown as three separate examples.\n\n Actually, the example input is provided as:\n\n Input:\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n But in the problem statement, the input format is: \"The only line contains three strings\"\n\n So we must read one line, and then split that line to get three strings.\n\n However, the example input above is given as a list of three strings. But in the actual input, it would be one line.\n\n Let's clarify: the input will be one string that has three tiles, each represented by two characters (like \"1s\", \"2s\", etc.), and they are separated by spaces.\n\n But wait, the example input is shown as three separate examples. The problem actually has three test cases, but we are to write a program that reads one set of three tiles.\n\n Actually, looking again: the example input is given as:\n\n   ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n This is just an illustration of three different inputs. In reality, we will read one line with three tiles.\n\n So, for example, if the input is:\n\n   1s 2s 3s\n\n Then we have three tiles: \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\".\n\n Steps:\n\n We have three tiles. We can consider two possibilities: \n   - Already having a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu). Then answer 0.\n   - Otherwise, we can try to see how many extra tiles we need to form a mentsu.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win\", and the goal is to have at least one mentsu.\n\n But note: the hand has three tiles. After drawing, the hand size increases. However, we don't necessarily need to use all the tiles. We just need at least one mentsu (a set of three) to be present.\n\n However, wait: the problem says \"she must have at least one mentsu\". The entire hand doesn't necessarily have to be used. But note: the hand after drawing may have more than three tiles, but we only require that there exists a mentsu (three identical or three consecutive in the same suit) anywhere.\n\n But note: the problem says \"after drawing a tile\", and she can draw any tile arbitrarily. And the goal is the minimum number of draws.\n\n Important: Since we start with three tiles, and we can draw any number, we are allowed to have more than three tiles.\n\n However, we are only required to form at least one mentsu. So we might not need to use all the drawn tiles.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n 1. If we already have a mentsu, then we don't need to draw any.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we can consider:\n\n   Option A: Draw 1 tile. Can we form a mentsu?\n        - For koutsu: we can check if there is a tile that appears at least twice. Then drawing one more of that tile would complete a triplet.\n        - For shuntsu: we can check for sequences.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to draw any tile. So:\n\n   For koutsu: if we have two identical tiles (same digit and same suit), then drawing one more of that tile gives a triplet.\n\n   For shuntsu: if we have two tiles that are consecutive and belong to the same suit, then we can complete a sequence by drawing the missing tile.\n\n   However, what if we have three tiles that are not forming a mentsu? Then we might need to draw 2 or even 3? But note: we can also form a mentsu by drawing two tiles to complete a triplet from a single tile? \n\n   Let me think: \n\n   Case 1: All three tiles are distinct (no duplicates, and no two forming a sequence).\n\n     Example: ['1m', '2p', '3s'] -> no mentsu.\n\n     Now, can we form a mentsu by drawing one tile? \n        - Koutsu: if we have two of the same, but we don't. So no.\n        - Shuntsu: we have two that are consecutive? No, because they are different suits. So no.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot form a mentsu with one draw.\n\n        Now, with two draws: \n          - We can form a triplet by drawing two copies of one tile (if we have one tile, then two draws: but wait, we have three distinct tiles. We can choose to duplicate one of them. Then we have four tiles, and we can form a triplet from the duplicated one. However, note: we only need one mentsu. So if we have [A, B, C] and we draw two copies of A, then we have [A, A, A, B, C]. Then we have a triplet [A,A,A]. So two draws.\n\n        Alternatively, we might form a sequence by drawing two tiles. But note: we can also form a triplet from one tile by drawing two of the same. So minimum two.\n\n        However, wait: maybe we can form a sequence with two draws? For example, if we have [1m, 2m, 4m] (but wait, initially we have three distinct, but maybe two are in the same suit). Let's take an example: ['1m', '2m', '4m'] (all same suit). Then we have two consecutive (1,2) and then 4. We can complete the sequence by drawing 3m. So one draw.\n\n        So let's break down:\n\n        We have three tiles. We can categorize by suit and digit.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Check if there is already a mentsu.\n\n            Koutsu: if any tile appears three times? But we have three tiles, so if there are three same, then yes. Also, if two same and then another same? Actually, if we have three same: [x,x,x] -> koutsu.\n\n            Shuntsu: three consecutive digits in the same suit.\n\n        Step 2: If not, then check if we can form a mentsu with one draw.\n\n            Possibility 1: Koutsu: if we have two of the same tile, then drawing one more of that tile gives a triplet.\n\n            Possibility 2: Shuntsu: if we have two tiles that are consecutive (same suit and their numbers are consecutive) and the third tile is irrelevant? Actually, we need three consecutive. \n\n            How to check for shuntsu with one draw?\n\n            We have three tiles. We can group by suit.\n\n            For a given suit, we have some numbers. We can sort the numbers. Then, for each consecutive triplet that can be formed (with the existing two and one missing) then we can complete with one draw.\n\n            However, note: we have three tiles, but they might be of different suits. We need to check per suit.\n\n            Example: ['1m', '2m', '4m'] -> same suit. We have [1,2,4]. The consecutive triplets that include these are [1,2,3] and [2,3,4]. We have two and one, so we can complete either [1,2,3] by drawing 3m, or [2,3,4] by drawing 3m. So one draw.\n\n            Another example: ['1m', '2m', '3p'] -> same suit for two, the third is different. Then we can complete the shuntsu in the same suit (1m,2m,3m) by drawing 3m. But wait, we have 3p, so we are drawing 3m. But note: the third tile is 3p, which is a different suit. We don't care about the third tile for the sequence. We are allowed to have extra tiles.\n\n            However, the problem: we must have at least one mentsu. So having [1m,2m,3m] (by drawing 3m) is enough, even if we have 3p as well.\n\n            So to check for one-draw shuntsu:\n\n                Group the tiles by suit.\n\n                For each suit, consider the set of numbers. We need to see if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers that are almost complete (i.e., we have two out of three, and the third can be drawn).\n\n                But note: we might have more than two in the same suit? Actually, the hand has three tiles. So maximum two per suit (unless two suits have one each and one suit has one, but wait, three tiles: could be two in one suit and one in another, or three in one suit, or one in each of three suits).\n\n                Let's consider:\n\n                Case: three in one suit: [a, b, c] (sorted). Then we can check for consecutive triplets. We can look for gaps.\n\n                Actually, we can do: for each suit, if we have at least two tiles, then let the sorted unique numbers be [x, y] (if two) or [x,y,z] (if three). \n\n                For two tiles in a suit: \n                    numbers = [a, b] (sorted). Then the missing number for a sequence could be a-1, a+1, b-1, b+1? Actually, the sequence must be three consecutive. The two tiles must be adjacent in the sequence? Not necessarily. But we can have:\n\n                    Example: [1,3] -> then we can complete the sequence [1,2,3] by drawing 2, or [0,1,2] (invalid because 0) or [3,4,5] (we don't have 4 and 5) — wait, we are only drawing one tile. So we can only complete one gap.\n\n                    Actually, the two tiles must be consecutive (like [n, n+1]) then we can complete by drawing n+2. Or they must be two apart (like [n, n+2]) then we can complete by drawing n+1.\n\n                    So for two tiles [a, b] (a < b):\n\n                        If b == a+1: then we can complete the sequence by drawing a-1 (if a-1>=1) or b+1 (if b+1<=9) to form [a-1, a, b] or [a, b, b+1] (but note: the sequence must be three consecutive, so [a-1, a, a+1] requires a-1, and [a, a+1, a+2] requires a+2). Actually, we have [a, a+1] so we can form [a, a+1, a+2] by drawing a+2, or [a-1, a, a+1] by drawing a-1.\n\n                        If b == a+2: then we can form [a, a+1, a+2] by drawing a+1.\n\n                    What if the two tiles are not consecutive and not two apart? Then we cannot form a shuntsu with one draw for this suit.\n\n                Case: three tiles in one suit: [a, b, c] (sorted). Then we can check if they form a consecutive triplet? i.e., b == a+1 and c == b+1. Then we already have a shuntsu.\n\n                But wait, we are checking for one-draw possibility. Actually, we are considering the case when we don't have a mentsu initially, so we don't have three consecutive. So we have three in one suit that are not consecutive. Then we can complete a shuntsu by drawing one tile? \n\n                Example: [1,2,4] (same suit). Then we can form [1,2,3] by drawing 3, or [2,3,4] by drawing 3. So one draw.\n\n                How to check for three tiles in one suit? We can check if the set of numbers is a subset of a consecutive triplet (i.e., the maximum minus minimum <= 2). Then we can complete the consecutive triplet by drawing the missing number.\n\n                Actually, we can generalize:\n\n                For a given suit, let the set of numbers be S (size 1, 2, or 3). \n\n                - If |S| == 3: then we have three distinct numbers. Then we can check if they form a consecutive triplet? Actually, no: [1,2,4] does not form a consecutive triplet, but we can complete one by adding one. However, we are not required to use exactly three tiles for the mentsu? Wait, no: the mentsu is defined as three tiles. So we need three consecutive. In the hand, we have three tiles (and we are going to draw one, so we have four). But we can ignore two of them? \n\n                Actually, the problem does not require to use all the tiles. We only need to have at least one mentsu (three tiles that form a koutsu or shuntsu). So we can use a subset of the tiles (plus the drawn ones) to form the mentsu.\n\n                Therefore, in the case of three tiles in one suit, we can use two of them and the drawn one to form a shuntsu.\n\n                So for one-draw shuntsu: \n\n                    For each suit, we have a multiset of numbers.\n\n                    We can consider every pair of numbers in the same suit, and check if they can be part of a consecutive triplet (with one missing). Then we can complete with one draw.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can consider the entire set of numbers for that suit and check if there is a consecutive triplet that contains at least two of the numbers.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                    Let the set of numbers (for a suit) be S (without duplicates). Then, for each number x in S, we can consider the triplet [x-1, x, x+1] (if x-1 and x+1 are in the range [1,9]). Then, if we have at least two numbers from {x-1, x, x+1} (excluding x itself if we don't have x, but wait, we have x, so we have one) then we are missing one. But wait, we have x, so we have one. Then we need two more? No, we are drawing one tile. \n\n                Actually, we are allowed to draw one tile. So for a given suit, we can form a shuntsu if there exists a consecutive triplet (three consecutive numbers) such that at least two of the three numbers are in the hand (for that suit). Then we can draw the missing one.\n\n                But note: we have three tiles in total, and they are distributed arbitrarily. So we can have multiple suits.\n\n                Algorithm for one-draw shuntsu:\n\n                    For each suit (m, p, s):\n                        Let the set of numbers in that suit be S.\n                        For each number x in the range 1 to 9 (or consider the possible triplets that might be completed by one draw) we can check:\n\n                            Consider the triplet starting at x: [x, x+1, x+2] (if x+2<=9)\n                            Then, the hand has some of these. We can count how many of [x, x+1, x+2] are in S.\n\n                            Similarly, we can consider triplet starting at x-1: [x-1, x, x+1] (if x-1>=1 and x+1<=9)\n                            And triplet starting at x-2: [x-2, x-1, x] (if x-2>=1 and x-1<=9)\n\n                        But actually, we can iterate over all consecutive triplets that are in the range [1,9] and check if the hand has at least two of the three numbers in that triplet for that suit.\n\n                    However, we can do:\n\n                        For a given suit, we have a set S (the distinct numbers). Then, for each consecutive triplet (i, i+1, i+2) where i from 1 to 7:\n\n                            Count how many numbers in {i, i+1, i+2} are in S.\n\n                            If the count >= 2, then we can complete this triplet by drawing the missing one (if any) in one draw.\n\n                    But note: we are drawing one tile. So if we have two of the three, then we can complete the triplet by drawing the third.\n\n                So if we find at least one such triplet in any suit, then one draw is sufficient.\n\n        Step 3: If not one draw, then we check for two draws.\n\n            We can complete a triplet: if we have one tile, then we need two more of the same. So if we have at least one tile (any tile) then we can draw two copies of that tile to form a triplet.\n\n            But wait, we have three tiles. We can choose any one to duplicate. So if we have at least one tile (which we do) then two draws can form a triplet.\n\n            Alternatively, we can form a shuntsu: we need to complete two gaps. But that might be more than two draws? Actually, we can complete a shuntsu with two draws if we have two tiles that are one apart (so we can complete two different sequences? Or we can complete one sequence by drawing two tiles? \n\n            Actually, for shuntsu, we need three consecutive. We can have two tiles that are not consecutive and not forming a two-gap. For example, [1m, 4m]. Then we need to draw two tiles: say 2m and 3m. Then we have [1m,4m,2m,3m] and we can form [1,2,3] or [2,3,4]. So two draws.\n\n            But wait, is two draws the minimum if one draw doesn't work?\n\n            However, note: we might also form a triplet with two draws (if we have one tile, then two draws of the same). So two draws is always possible.\n\n            But is there a case where one draw is not sufficient and two draws is the minimum?\n\n            Example: ['1m', '2p', '3s'] (all distinct suits and consecutive but not same suit). Then:\n\n                One draw: \n                  - Cannot form koutsu because no duplicate.\n                  - Cannot form shuntsu because the tiles are in different suits.\n\n                Two draws: \n                  - We can form a triplet by drawing two of one tile (say two 1m) -> then we have [1m,1m,1m] and the other two tiles. So two draws.\n\n                Another example: ['1m', '1m', '2p'] (two same, one different). Then one draw: we can complete the triplet (so 0 draws for koutsu? Actually, we have two 1m, so one draw of 1m completes a triplet. So one draw is sufficient.\n\n                Another example: ['1m','2m','4m'] (one draw is sufficient for shuntsu). \n\n                Another example: ['1m','4m','7m'] (same suit, distinct). Then one draw: \n                    We can form a triplet? No, because we have one of each.\n                    We can form a shuntsu? We need three consecutive. We have [1,4,7]. We can complete a consecutive triplet by drawing two tiles? Actually, we can complete one of the gaps: \n                        For example, to form [1,2,3] we need 2,3; to form [2,3,4] we need 2,3; to form [3,4,5] we need 3,5; etc. But we can only draw one tile. So no.\n\n                    Then two draws: we can form a triplet by drawing two of one tile (e.g., two 1m) -> then we have [1m,1m,1m] and the rest. So two draws.\n\n                But wait, is two draws the minimum? Actually, we can also form two different sequences? Actually, we are only required to form one mentsu.\n\n                However, note: we might form a shuntsu with two draws by completing one of the gaps? For example, to form [1,2,3] we need two draws (2 and 3). Then we have [1,2,3] and the rest. So two draws.\n\n                So the minimum number of draws is either 0, 1, or 2 (since three draws is always possible by drawing three same, but two is already minimal if one isn't).\n\n            But wait, is there a case that requires three draws? \n\n                Example: ['1m','2p','3s'] -> we said two draws.\n\n                Actually, we can always form a triplet by drawing two copies of any tile. So two draws is always sufficient.\n\n            Therefore, the answer can only be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have three tiles that are all the same? Then we have a koutsu (triplet) so 0.\n\n        Summary:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Parse the input: one line with three strings.\n\n        2. Represent each tile as (digit, suit). We have three tiles.\n\n        3. Check for existing mentsu:\n\n            a) Koutsu: any tile repeated three times? \n                Since we have three tiles, if we have three identical, then yes.\n\n                But we can also have three identical by having two pairs? Actually, no: three identical means three same. But we can have two pairs of different tiles? Then we don't have a triplet. \n\n                Actually, triplet is three identical. So we can check: \n                    Count frequency of each tile (each (digit, suit) combination). If any count is 3, then koutsu.\n\n            b) Shuntsu: three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n                We can check: group by suit. For a suit, if there are at least three tiles (but we have only three in total, so maximum three), then we can check if the sorted numbers form a consecutive sequence of length three.\n\n                However, we might have more than three tiles? No, we have exactly three.\n\n                But note: the three tiles might be of the same suit and form a consecutive triplet.\n\n                Example: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> consecutive.\n\n                Example: ['2m','3m','4m'] -> consecutive.\n\n                Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> not consecutive.\n\n                Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> not consecutive (because two 1m and one 2m: the three tiles are [1,1,2] -> not consecutive).\n\n                So for shuntsu: \n                    Group by suit. For a suit, let the set of numbers be S (without duplicates). Then the distinct numbers must be three and consecutive? Actually, no: we can have duplicates. \n\n                But note: the definition of shuntsu is three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit. It doesn't say distinct. However, the example [5p,4p,6p] (which is [4,5,6]) is valid. But note: the example says [5p,4p,6p] is valid. However, the representation might be in any order.\n\n                But wait, the example [5p,4p,6p] is the same as [4p,5p,6p]. \n\n                However, the problem says: \"A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s]\"\n\n                Note: [5s, 7s, 6s] is [5,6,7] (sorted). So the sequence must be three consecutive distinct numbers.\n\n                Therefore, duplicates don't help. We need three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n                So for a given suit, we need three distinct numbers that form a consecutive triplet.\n\n                But wait, the hand has three tiles. They must be three distinct tiles (so three distinct representations). However, we can have duplicates. \n\n                Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> we don't have three distinct numbers. So no.\n\n                Therefore, we must have three distinct tiles (three distinct representations) and they must be of the same suit and form a consecutive triplet.\n\n                However, wait: the example [5p,4p,6p] is given as valid. That is three distinct tiles (5p,4p,6p) and they form [4,5,6] (consecutive). \n\n                But note: the example input: ['3p 9m 2p'] -> one of the examples.\n\n                So the algorithm for shuntsu:\n\n                    Group the three tiles by suit.\n\n                    For a suit, if there are at least three tiles (so three tiles of the same suit) then we can extract the numbers. But we have only three tiles, so we can have three tiles of the same suit.\n\n                    Then, we have three numbers (they might not be distinct? Actually, the tile representation is by (digit, suit). So if we have two same tiles, then the digit is the same. \n\n                    But the shuntsu requires distinct numbers (because consecutive numbers are distinct). So we need three distinct digits in the same suit, and they form a consecutive sequence.\n\n                    However, wait: what if we have two same tiles? Then we cannot form a consecutive sequence because we need three distinct numbers.\n\n                    Therefore, the condition for shuntsu is: there exists a suit with at least three distinct digits that form a consecutive sequence (when sorted, the difference between max and min is 2, and the set has exactly three elements).\n\n                    But wait: we have three tiles, so if we have three distinct digits (same suit) then the set has three elements.\n\n                    Example: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> set = {1,2,3}, sorted: [1,2,3] -> consecutive.\n\n                    Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> set = {1,2,4}, sorted: [1,2,4] -> not consecutive.\n\n                    Example: ['2m','3m','4m'] -> consecutive.\n\n                    Example: ['1m','3m','4m'] -> set = {1,3,4} -> not consecutive (because 3 and 4 are consecutive, but 1 is not adjacent to 3).\n\n                    So the consecutive triplet must be three consecutive numbers.\n\n        4. Therefore, we can check:\n\n            Condition 0 (already a mentsu):\n\n            if (there is a tile that appears three times) OR (there is a suit with three distinct numbers that form a consecutive triplet)\n\n            Then answer 0.\n\n        5. Else, check for one draw:\n\n            a) Koutsu: if there is a tile that appears at least two times (so we can draw one more to complete the triplet). Then one draw.\n\n            b) Shuntsu: for each suit, if there are two or three tiles (but we have only three in total, so maximum three) then we can check if there exists a consecutive triplet (three consecutive numbers) such that we have at least two of the three numbers (in that suit). Then we can complete the triplet by drawing the missing one.\n\n            How to check for one-draw shuntsu:\n\n                For each suit, let the set of numbers be S (the distinct numbers in that suit).\n\n                Then, for each consecutive triplet (i, i+1, i+2) for i from 1 to 7:\n\n                    Let T = {i, i+1, i+2}\n                    Count how many numbers in T are in S.\n\n                    If the count >= 2, then we can complete this triplet by drawing the missing one.\n\n                If we find at least one such triplet in any suit, then one draw is sufficient.\n\n            Note: We are allowed to draw any tile, so we can choose the missing tile.\n\n        6. If neither condition for one draw holds, then the answer is 2.\n\n        However, wait: is two draws always sufficient? Yes, because we can always complete a triplet by drawing two of the same tile (any tile we have, we can duplicate it twice). \n\n        But note: what if we have three tiles that are all distinct and from different suits? Then we have no duplicates and no consecutive. Then two draws: we can take one tile (say '1m') and draw two more '1m' to form a triplet.\n\n        Therefore, the answer can only be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: Input: \"1s 2s 3s\"\n            Tiles: [('1','s'), ('2','s'), ('3','s')]\n            Check for koutsu: no duplicates (each tile once).\n            Check for shuntsu: same suit, distinct numbers {1,2,3} -> consecutive? yes, because 1,2,3 are consecutive. So 0.\n\n        Example 2: Input: \"9m 9m 9m\"\n            Tiles: [('9','m'), ('9','m'), ('9','m')]\n            Check for koutsu: three '9m' -> yes. So 0.\n\n        Example 3: Input: \"3p 9m 2p\"\n            Tiles: [('3','p'), ('9','m'), ('2','p')]\n            Check for koutsu: \n                '3p': count=2, '9m': count=1 -> so we have two '3p'. So koutsu condition: we can complete a triplet by drawing one '3p'. So one draw.\n\n            But wait, the example output is 1.\n\n            However, note: the example input is given as \"3p 9m 2p\", and the example output is 1.\n\n            But wait, the example in the problem says: \n                Input: ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] \n                Output: ['0','0','1']\n\n            So our program should output 1 for \"3p 9m 2p\".\n\n            However, we found that koutsu condition holds (two '3p') so one draw is sufficient.\n\n            But wait, the example output is 1, so that matches.\n\n        But wait, what if we have two of one tile and one of another, but the two are not the same as the one we want to complete? \n\n        Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> koutsu condition: two '1m', so one draw of '1m' forms a triplet.\n\n        Example: ['1m','1m','3m'] -> koutsu: two '1m', so one draw of '1m' forms a triplet.\n\n        Example: ['1m','2m','2m'] -> koutsu: two '2m', so one draw of '2m' forms a triplet.\n\n        Now, what about shuntsu? \n\n        Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> one draw: shuntsu condition: \n            For suit 'm': S = {1,2,4}\n            Check consecutive triplets:\n                i=1: {1,2,3} -> count: 1 and 2 are present -> count=2 -> we can complete by drawing 3 -> valid.\n                i=2: {2,3,4} -> count: 2 and 4 -> count=2 -> we can complete by drawing 3 -> valid.\n\n            So one draw.\n\n        Example: ['1m','3m','4m'] -> \n            For suit 'm': S = {1,3,4}\n            Check consecutive triplets:\n                i=1: {1,2,3} -> count: 1 and 3 -> count=2 -> valid (draw 2)\n                i=2: {2,3,4} -> count: 3 and 4 -> count=2 -> valid (draw 2)\n\n            So one draw.\n\n        Example: ['1m','4m','5m'] -> \n            For suit 'm': S = {1,4,5}\n            Check consecutive triplets:\n                i=1: {1,2,3} -> count=1 (only 1)\n                i=2: {2,3,4} -> count=0 (none)\n                i=3: {3,4,5} -> count=2 (4 and 5) -> valid (draw 3)\n\n            So one draw.\n\n        Example: ['1m','5m','9m'] -> \n            For suit 'm': S = {1,5,9}\n            Check consecutive triplets: none of them has two numbers. \n                i=1: {1,2,3} -> count=1\n                i=2: {2,3,4} -> count=0\n                i=3: {3,4,5} -> count=1 (5)\n                i=4: {4,5,6} -> count=1 (5)\n                i=5: {5,6,7} -> count=1 (5)\n                i=6: {6,7,8} -> count=0\n                i=7: {7,8,9} -> count=1 (9)\n\n            So no one-draw shuntsu.\n\n            Now, koutsu: no duplicate (each tile distinct). So not by koutsu.\n\n            Then we need two draws.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            Read the three tiles.\n\n            Let tiles = [tile1, tile2, tile3]\n\n            Step 0: Preprocess: \n                We can represent a tile as (suit, number). But note: the input string is two characters: first digit, second letter.\n\n            Step 1: Check for existing mentsu (0 draws)\n\n                koutsu: \n                    from collections import Counter\n                    count_tiles = Counter(tiles)   # but wait, we have to define a key: (suit, number) ?\n\n                Actually, we have three tiles. We can do:\n\n                    Let tiles_list = []\n                    for each string in the input (split by space, but the input is one line with three space separated two-character strings)\n\n                    Example: \"1s 2s 3s\" -> split into ['1s','2s','3s']\n\n                    Then for each string, we can split into [digit, suit] -> but actually, the string is two characters.\n\n                    We can do: \n                        tile1 = input_line.split()[0]\n                        tile2 = input_line.split()[1]\n                        tile3 = input_line.split()[2]\n\n                    Then, for each tile, we have (suit = last char, number = first char) OR (number = first char, suit = last char) ?\n\n                    The problem: \"For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\"\n\n                    So the tile string is like \"1s\": number is '1', suit is 's'.\n\n                So we can create a tuple (suit, number) OR (number, suit)? \n\n                Actually, for koutsu: we need the same tile (same number and same suit). So we should use (suit, number) OR (number, suit)? \n\n                The problem says: [1m,1m,1m] is koutsu, but [1m,1p,1s] is not. So we must consider both number and suit.\n\n                So we can represent a tile as (suit, int(number))? But wait, for shuntsu we care about the number and the suit.\n\n                Actually, we can represent a tile as (suit, number) and then:\n\n                For koutsu: if we have three identical (suit, number) then koutsu.\n\n                But wait: what if we have two tiles that are same (same number and same suit) and then a third tile that is different? Then koutsu is not satisfied.\n\n                So:\n\n                koutsu = False\n                count = {}\n                for tile in tiles:\n                    s = tile[1]   # suit\n                    num = tile[0] # number (as string, but we can compare as string or int? but numbers are digits, so same)\n                    key = (s, num)\n                    count[key] = count.get(key, 0) + 1\n                    if count[key] == 3:\n                        koutsu = True\n\n                But wait, we have three tiles. Alternatively, we can use a Counter and then check if any value is 3.\n\n                However, note: we have three tiles, so if any tile appears three times, then koutsu.\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                from collections import Counter\n                c = Counter()\n                for i in range(3):\n                    tile_str = input_line.split()[i]\n                    s = tile_str[1]\n                    num = tile_str[0]\n                    c[(s, num)] += 1\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking if the given three tiles already form a mentsu. If not, we need to find out if drawing one additional tile can form a mentsu. If still not possible, then drawing two tiles will suffice to form a mentsu by either completing a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu).\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit). If any tile appears three times in the initial hand, no draws are needed.\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit. If the three tiles in the same suit form a consecutive sequence, no draws are needed.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the three tiles form a koutsu or shuntsu. If yes, the answer is 0.\n   - **Check for One Draw**: If no existing mentsu, check if drawing one tile can form a koutsu (two identical tiles exist) or a shuntsu (two tiles in the same suit form part of a consecutive sequence).\n   - **Default to Two Draws**: If neither condition is met, two draws are sufficient to form a mentsu (either by completing a triplet or a sequence).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple checks with constant time complexity O(1) since the input size is fixed (three tiles).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = []\n    for tile_str in data:\n        num = tile_str[0]\n        suit = tile_str[1]\n        tiles.append((suit, num))\n        \n    count_dict = {}\n    for t in tiles:\n        key = t\n        count_dict[key] = count_dict.get(key, 0) + 1\n        \n    has_koutsu = False\n    for count in count_dict.values():\n        if count >= 3:\n            has_koutsu = True\n            break\n            \n    has_shuntsu = False\n    suits = {}\n    for t in tiles:\n        s = t[0]\n        num = t[1]\n        if s not in suits:\n            suits[s] = set()\n        suits[s].add(num)\n        \n    for s, nums in suits.items():\n        nums_list = sorted(nums)\n        if len(nums_list) < 3:\n            continue\n        if nums_list[2] - nums_list[0] == 2 and len(set(nums_list)) == 3:\n            has_shuntsu = True\n            break\n            \n    if has_koutsu or has_shuntsu:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    has_one_draw_koutsu = False\n    for t in tiles:\n        key = t\n        if count_dict[key] >= 2:\n            has_one_draw_koutsu = True\n            break\n            \n    has_one_draw_shuntsu = False\n    for s, nums in suits.items():\n        nums_list = sorted(list(nums))\n        for i in range(1, 8):\n            triplet = {i-1, i, i+1}\n            if i-1 < 1 or i+1 > 9:\n                continue\n            count_in_triplet = 0\n            for num in nums_list:\n                if num in triplet:\n                    count_in_triplet += 1\n            if count_in_triplet >= 2:\n                has_one_draw_shuntsu = True\n                break\n        if has_one_draw_shuntsu:\n            break\n            \n    if has_one_draw_koutsu or has_one_draw_shuntsu:\n        print(1)\n    else:\n        print(2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read as three strings, each representing a tile. Each tile is split into its number and suit components.\n2. **Koutsu Check**: The code checks if any tile appears three times. If found, it prints 0 as no draws are needed.\n3. **Shuntsu Check**: The code checks if any suit has three distinct consecutive numbers. If found, it prints 0.\n4. **One Draw Check**: If no existing mentsu, the code checks if drawing one tile can form a koutsu (two identical tiles exist) or a shuntsu (two tiles in the same suit form part of a consecutive sequence). If either condition is met, it prints 1.\n5. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 2, indicating that two draws are needed to form a mentsu (either by completing a triplet or a sequence). \n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible scenarios to determine the minimum number of draws required, leveraging simple dictionary and set operations for clarity and performance.",
