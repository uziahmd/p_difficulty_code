    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is the outer border). \n Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and has a width of 1 cell.\n\n The i-th ring (with i starting at 1) is drawn on the inner rectangle of size:\n   (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))\n\n However, note that the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. The number of cells in the border of an a x b rectangle is:\n   If a >= 3 and b >= 3: then the border (the outer ring) has 2*a + 2*b - 4 (because the four corners are counted twice).\n\n But note: the problem states that the first ring is the entire outer edge of the original plate, so for the first ring we have an outer rectangle of w x h.\n\n However, there's a catch: the rings are drawn inwards. The second ring is drawn on a rectangle that is 2 cells in from each edge, so the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4). But note: the second ring is the border of that (w-4) x (h-4) rectangle.\n\n Important: The condition for k is that k must be at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This means that we won't have a negative dimension.\n\n How to compute the number of cells for the i-th ring?\n   Let the current rectangle for the i-th ring be: \n        a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   Then the number of cells in the ring is: 2 * a_i + 2 * b_i - 4, but wait: this formula counts the entire border of a rectangle of size a_i x b_i.\n\n However, note that the example:\n\n Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> output 8.\n   For i=1: a1 = 3, b1=3 -> 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8. Correct.\n\n Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> output 28.\n   i=1: a1=7, b1=9 -> 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 32? That doesn't match.\n\n Wait, let me recalc: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32, but expected is 28.\n\n Alternatively, consider the example drawing: \n   The first ring for a 7x9 plate: \n     It should be the border of a 7x9, which is 7*2 + 9*2 - 4 = 14+18-4=32? \n     But wait, the example output is 28.\n\n Let me check the example again: the input \"7 9 1\" gives output 28.\n\n There seems to be a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"each ring has a width of 1 cell\". The first ring is the edge of the plate. \n\n But note: the plate is 7x9. The outer ring would normally be the perimeter of the 7x9 grid. However, if you think about it, the grid has 7 rows and 9 columns.\n\n The outer ring: \n   Top and bottom: 9 cells each -> 18\n   Left and right: 7-2 = 5 cells each (because the top and bottom rows are already counted) -> 5*2 = 10\n   Total: 18+10 = 28.\n\n So the correct formula for the outer ring is: \n   top and bottom: each has h (if the rectangle is a x b, then top and bottom are b long) but wait: for the entire outer ring of the original plate (a=w, b=h):\n        top: h, bottom: h, left: w-2 (excluding the two corners already in top and bottom), right: w-2.\n        So total: h + h + (w-2) + (w-2) = 2*h + 2*(w-2) = 2*w + 2*h - 4.\n\n But wait, that is the same as 2*w + 2*h - 4.\n\n Now for the example \"7 9\": 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 32? \n\n Why did I get 28 by counting differently?\n\n Let me break down the 7x9 grid:\n\n   Row 0: 9 cells (top border)\n   Row 6: 9 cells (bottom border)\n   For the middle rows (row 1 to 5): only the first and last column (so 2 cells per row)\n\n   So total: 9 (top) + 9 (bottom) + (7-2)*2 = 9+9+10 = 28.\n\n So the formula for the i-th ring is not just 2*a_i + 2*b_i - 4, because the a_i and b_i are the dimensions of the inner rectangle, and the ring is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n Actually, the border of a rectangle of size a_i x b_i is: \n   top: b_i, bottom: b_i, left: a_i-2, right: a_i-2 -> total: 2*b_i + 2*(a_i-2) = 2*a_i + 2*b_i - 4.\n\n But wait, for the first ring: a_i = w, b_i = h -> 2*w + 2*h - 4.\n\n However, the example \"3 3 1\": 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4=8 -> correct.\n\n But the example \"7 9\": 2*7+2*9-4=14+18-4=32, but we calculated 28 by hand.\n\n There is a discrepancy. Let me recalc the hand calculation for 7x9:\n\n   Using the formula: 2*a_i + 2*b_i - 4 = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 32.\n\n   But the hand calculation: 9 (top) + 9 (bottom) + (7-2)*2 (left and right without top and bottom) = 9+9+10 = 28.\n\n Why the difference? \n\n Let me draw the 7x9 grid:\n\n   The outer ring should include:\n      Row0: all 9 cells.\n      Row6: all 9 cells.\n      For rows 1 to 5: only the first and last columns (so 2 cells per row) -> 5 rows * 2 = 10.\n\n   Total: 9 + 9 + 10 = 28.\n\n The formula 2*a_i + 2*b_i - 4 = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 32.\n\n What is the issue? \n\n The formula 2*a_i + 2*b_i - 4 is the standard formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, but note: in a grid representation, the perimeter in terms of cells is not exactly the same as the geometric perimeter.\n\n Actually, the standard formula for the number of cells in the border of an a x b grid is: \n   top row: b\n   bottom row: b\n   left column: a-2 (excluding the two corners already counted in top and bottom)\n   right column: a-2\n\n   Total: b + b + (a-2) + (a-2) = 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n But wait, in our hand calculation we did: 9 (top) + 9 (bottom) + (7-2)*2 (for the sides) -> that's the same as 2*9 + 2*(7-2) = 18 + 10 = 28.\n\n And the formula above gives 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4=32.\n\n There is an inconsistency: which one is correct?\n\n Let me break down the grid with the standard formula:\n\n   The standard formula: 2*a + 2*b - 4 = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 32.\n\n   But the actual count by rows and columns:\n\n   We can think of the border as:\n\n   - The top row: 9 cells.\n   - The bottom row: 9 cells.\n   - The left side: from row1 to row5, so 5 cells (but wait, the corners are already included in the top and bottom rows, so we don't count the corners again). So the left side should be 5 cells (from row1 to row5) and similarly the right side 5 cells.\n\n   So the total is: 9 (top) + 9 (bottom) + 5 (left) + 5 (right) = 9+9+5+5 = 28.\n\n Why does the standard formula give 32? \n\n The standard formula for the border is also: \n   Total = a + b + (a-2) + (b-2) ??? \n\n Let me re-derive:\n\n   The top row: b cells.\n   The bottom row: b cells.\n   The left column: a-2 (because we remove the top and bottom cells which are already in the top and bottom rows)\n   The right column: a-2.\n\n   So: 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*b + 2*a - 4.\n\n   Now, for a=7, b=9: 2*9 + 2*7 - 4 = 18 + 14 - 4 = 32.\n\n   But wait, that does not match our manual count.\n\n   In our manual count, the left column was counted as 5, but according to the formula we use (a-2) we get 7-2=5, so that part is 5*2=10. Then the two rows: 9*2=18, so 18+10=28.\n\n   The issue is that the formula 2*a + 2*b - 4 is actually:\n\n        = 2*(a+b) - 4\n\n   But wait, let's break down the grid:\n\n        We have:\n          Top: b\n          Bottom: b\n          Left: a-2\n          Right: a-2\n\n        So: b + b + (a-2) + (a-2) = 2*b + 2*a - 4.\n\n   And that equals 2*(a+b)-4.\n\n   Now, why is our manual count 9+9+5+5=28, but 2*7+2*9-4=32?\n\n   The mistake is in the manual count: the left and right columns are a-2, but a is the number of rows. \n\n   Actually, the grid has 7 rows and 9 columns.\n\n   The top row: 9 cells (row0, columns0 to 8)\n   The bottom row: 9 cells (row6, columns0 to 8)\n\n   For the left column (column0): we have rows1 to row5 (because row0 and row6 are already counted in top and bottom). That's 5 cells (rows1 to 5).\n   Similarly, the right column (column8): 5 cells.\n\n   So the total is 9 (top) + 9 (bottom) + 5 (left) + 5 (right) = 28.\n\n   Now, what is the value of a and b in the formula? \n        a = 7 (rows) = height in terms of rows? \n        b = 9 (columns) = width in terms of columns?\n\n   The formula 2*a + 2*b - 4 uses a as the number of rows and b as the number of columns.\n\n   But note: the left and right columns have a-2 cells, and a is the number of rows.\n\n   So the formula is correct: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 32.\n\n   Why do we get 28 then?\n\n   Let me try to count with the formula's breakdown:\n\n        Top: b = 9\n        Bottom: b = 9\n        Left: a-2 = 5\n        Right: a-2 = 5\n\n   Then total = 9 + 9 + 5 + 5 = 28.\n\n   Wait, that matches! \n\n   But wait, the formula I wrote above was: 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*9 + 2*(7-2) = 18 + 10 = 28.\n\n   And the expression 2*a + 2*b - 4 is the same as 2*(a+b)-4, which is 2*(7+9)-4=2*16-4=32-4=28? No, 2*(7+9)=32, then subtract 4: 28.\n\n   Actually, 2*a + 2*b - 4 = 2*(a+b) - 4, which is the same as (2*a + 2*b - 4). \n\n   So why did I write two different expressions? \n\n   Let me clarify:\n\n        Expression1: 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*b + 2*a - 4 = 2*(a+b) - 4.\n\n        Expression2: 2*a + 2*b - 4 = 2*(a+b) - 4.\n\n   So they are the same.\n\n   Therefore, the correct formula for the i-th ring is:\n\n        a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n        Then the number of cells for the ring is: 2*(a_i + b_i) - 4.\n\n   But wait, when i=1, w=7, h=9: 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4 = 32-4=28. Correct.\n\n   And for the example \"3 3 1\": 2*(3+3)-4 = 2*6-4=12-4=8. Correct.\n\n   Now, what if we have more than one ring? \n\n   Example: \"7 9 2\"\n\n   k=2, so we have two rings.\n\n   First ring: i=1 -> a1=7, b1=9 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 28.\n   Second ring: i=2 -> a2 = 7 - 4*(2-1)=7-4=3, b2=9-4=5 -> 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4=16-4=12.\n\n   Total gilded cells: 28+12=40.\n\n   The example input \"7 9 2\" outputs 40.\n\n   Therefore, the approach is:\n\n        total_cells = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            # If the current rectangle has non-positive dimensions, we break, but the problem ensures k is within bounds so we don't have negative.\n            if a_i <= 0 or b_i <= 0:\n                break\n            ring_cells = 2 * (a_i + b_i) - 4\n            total_cells += ring_cells\n\n        print(total_cells)\n\n However, note the condition: k is at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This ensures that we don't get negative dimensions until after k rings.\n\n But wait, what if the dimensions become too small? The problem says the i-th ring is defined for the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1)) x (h-4*(i-1)). \n\n Since k is bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4), then the smallest rectangle we consider will have at least 3x3? Not necessarily, because:\n\n   Condition: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)\n\n   Let m = min(w, h). Then the last ring (k-th) will have:\n\n        a_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= w - 4*(floor((m+1)/4)-1) \n\n   But note: the condition ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has positive dimensions.\n\n   However, the problem does not require that the ring has at least 3x3, but note the formula for the ring requires that the rectangle has at least 3x3? \n\n   Actually, the formula 2*(a_i+b_i)-4 works for any a_i>=1 and b_i>=1? \n\n   Consider a_i=1, b_i=1: then 2*(1+1)-4 = 0. But that is acceptable because a 1x1 rectangle has no border (the border would be the entire cell, but the formula for a border of a 1x1 is 1, but wait: the border of a 1x1 is 1 cell? \n\n   Let me check: \n        We have a 1x1 grid. The border is the entire grid, so 1 cell.\n\n   But our formula: 2*(1+1)-4 = 4-4=0. That is wrong.\n\n   Similarly, for a_i=2, b_i=2: \n        The grid has 2x2. The border: \n           top: 2, bottom: 2, left: 0 (because 2-2=0), right:0 -> total 4.\n        Formula: 2*(2+2)-4=8-4=4 -> correct.\n\n   For a_i=1, b_i=2: \n        Grid: \n          [ [cell1], [cell2] ]\n          [ [cell3], [cell4] ] -> but wait, 1x2 grid: actually 1 row and 2 columns.\n\n        The border: \n          top: 2, bottom: 2, left: 0 (because 1-2=-1? wait, we don't use negative) -> but in our formula we use a_i-2, so for a_i=1, left=1-2=-1 -> which is not valid.\n\n   Therefore, we must ensure that the rectangle has at least 3 in both dimensions to have a border (so that a_i>=3 and b_i>=3) because otherwise the border is simply the entire grid.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: the i-th ring is drawn on the inner rectangle of size (w-4*(i-1))x(h-4*(i-1)). \n\n   The ring is defined as the border of that rectangle. The border of a rectangle of size a_i x b_i is:\n\n        If a_i >= 1 and b_i >= 1: the border is the set of cells that are either in the first row, last row, first column, or last column.\n\n        The number of cells is: \n            top: b_i\n            bottom: b_i\n            left: a_i - 2 (if a_i>=2, else 0)   [because if a_i==1, then the left and right are the same as the top and bottom, so we don't want to double count]\n            right: a_i - 2\n\n        But wait, we cannot have negative. So:\n\n            left = max(0, a_i - 2)\n            right = max(0, a_i - 2)\n\n        Then the total is: 2*b_i + 2*max(0, a_i-2)\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            total = 0\n            if a_i == 1 and b_i == 1:\n                total = 1\n            elif a_i == 1 or b_i == 1:\n                total = a_i * b_i   # because the entire grid is the border (it's a degenerate rectangle)\n            else:\n                total = 2*a_i + 2*b_i - 4\n\n   But note: the problem states that the rings are drawn until the k-th, and k is bounded so that the inner rectangle has positive dimensions, but we might still have a_i < 3 or b_i < 3.\n\n   However, the condition for k: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n   Let m = min(w, h). Then the smallest dimension of the k-th ring is m - 4*(k-1). \n\n   Since k <= floor((m+1)/4), then:\n\n        m - 4*(k-1) >= m - 4*((m+1)//4 - 1)\n\n   But note: (m+1)//4 is the floor division. \n\n   Example: m=3 -> k<= (3+1)//4 = 4//4=1 -> then the second ring would require 3-4*(1)= -1, which is invalid, so k=1 is the maximum.\n\n   Another example: m=4 -> k<= (4+1)//4 = 5//4=1 -> then the first ring: a_i=4, b_i=... but wait, the condition is for the minimum, so if w=4, h=5, then k<= (4+1)//4=1.\n\n   But what if the rectangle is 4x5, then the first ring: \n        a1=4, b1=5 -> 2*(4+5)-4=18-4=14.\n\n   However, the border of a 4x5 grid: \n        top:5, bottom:5, left:2, right:2 -> 5+5+2+2=14.\n\n   Now, if we try to draw a second ring: \n        a2=4-4=0, which is invalid. But the problem condition says k is at most 1.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   But what if we have a_i=2, b_i= something?\n\n   Example: w=2, h=100, but wait w>=3 by input constraint.\n\n   Input constraint: w, h from 3 to 100.\n\n   Then the smallest w is 3. \n\n   For k=1: \n        a1=3, b1=h (which is at least 3). Then the formula 2*(3+h)-4 = 2*h+2, which is positive.\n\n   For k=2: \n        a2=3-4=-1 -> invalid, but the condition: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) -> for w=3, h=100, min=3, floor((3+1)/4)=1, so k<=1.\n\n   Therefore, we will never have a_i or b_i less than 3? \n\n   Actually, the condition ensures that after k rings, the dimensions are still positive. However, note that the condition is:\n\n        k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n   Then the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has dimensions:\n\n        a_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= w - 4*(floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)-1)\n\n   But note: the minimal w and h are 3, and the condition is designed so that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 3 in the smallest dimension? \n\n   Let me check: \n\n        Condition: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n        Then the smallest dimension of the k-th ring is: min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - 4*(floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)-1)\n\n        But note: 4*(floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)) <= min(w, h)+1\n\n        So: min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - (min(w, h)+1 - 1) = min(w, h) - min(w, h) = 0.\n\n        So it is non-negative. But we need to check if it is at least 3? \n\n        Actually, the condition is only that the dimensions are positive. \n\n   However, the problem says the i-th ring is defined on the inner rectangle of size (w-4(i-1))x(h-4(i-1)), so even if the rectangle has size 1x1, we can still define it, but then the border is 1 cell.\n\n   But our formula for the border of a rectangle of size a_i x b_i is:\n\n        if a_i < 3 and b_i < 3: \n            then the entire rectangle is the border (because the border is the whole thing) -> a_i * b_i\n        else if a_i < 3 and b_i >=3:\n            then the border is the entire rectangle? Actually, no: if one dimension is 1 and the other is large, then the entire rectangle is the border.\n\n   Actually, the border of a rectangle is the set of cells that are on the edge. \n\n   For a rectangle of a_i x b_i:\n\n        The border consists of:\n            all cells in the first row, last row, first column, last column.\n\n        The total number of border cells is:\n\n            = (number of cells in the first row) + (last row) + (first column excluding the two ends) + (last column excluding the two ends)\n\n        But if a_i == 1, then the first and last row are the same, and the first and last column are the same. So we don't want to double count.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            border_cells = 0\n            if a_i == 1 and b_i == 1:\n                border_cells = 1\n            else:\n                # General case: \n                border_cells = 2*(a_i + b_i) - 4   if a_i>=2 and b_i>=2, but wait if one is 1 and the other>=2, then:\n\n                Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                border_cells = 2*a_i + 2*b_i - 4   if a_i>=2 and b_i>=2.\n\n                But if a_i==1 and b_i>=2:\n                    Then the border is the entire rectangle: b_i (since there's only one row) -> but wait, the entire rectangle is the border, so the number is a_i * b_i? \n                    Actually, the entire rectangle is the border because the grid has only one row, so every cell is on the border.\n\n                Similarly, if a_i>=2 and b_i==1: border_cells = a_i.\n\n                Actually, the standard way is:\n\n                    border_cells = 2*(a_i + b_i) - 4   if a_i>=2 and b_i>=2.\n\n                    Otherwise, the entire rectangle is the border: a_i * b_i.\n\n        However, note: the problem defines the ring as the border of the inner rectangle. And the problem says the first ring is the edge of the plate (which is the outer border). \n\n        But the example input constraints say w, h>=3, and k is bounded so that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has positive dimensions. \n\n        However, we might have a_i or b_i being 1 or 2 in intermediate rings? \n\n        Let me see: the condition for k: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n        Example: w=3, h=3, k=1 -> a1=3, b1=3 -> valid.\n\n        Example: w=3, h=100, k=1 -> a1=3, b1=100 -> valid.\n\n        Example: w=3, h=3, k= floor((3+1)/4)=1 -> so k=1.\n\n        Example: w=4, h=4, k= floor((4+1)/4)=1 -> so k=1.\n\n        Example: w=5, h=5, k= floor((5+1)/4)=1 -> k=1.\n\n        Example: w=6, h=6, k= floor((6+1)/4)=1 -> k=1.\n\n        Example: w=7, h=7, k= floor((7+1)/4)=2 -> k=2.\n\n        Then for the second ring: a2=7-4=3, b2=3 -> valid.\n\n        Example: w=8, h=8, k= floor((8+1)/4)=2 -> k=2.\n\n        Then second ring: a2=8-4=4, b2=4 -> valid.\n\n        Example: w=9, h=9, k= floor((9+1)/4)=2 -> k=2.\n\n        Then second ring: a2=9-4=5, b2=5 -> valid.\n\n        Example: w=10, h=10, k= floor((10+1)/4)=2 -> k=2.\n\n        Then second ring: a2=10-4=6, b2=6 -> valid.\n\n        Example: w=11, h=11, k= floor((11+1)/4)=3 -> k=3.\n\n        Then third ring: a3=11-8=3, b3=3 -> valid.\n\n        Example: w=12, h=12, k= floor((12+1)/4)=3 -> k=3.\n\n        Then third ring: a3=12-8=4, b3=4 -> valid.\n\n        So the minimal dimension we get is 3, then 4, etc. \n\n        Therefore, we will always have a_i>=3 and b_i>=3 for all rings from 1 to k, because:\n\n            The minimal dimension for the first ring is 3 (since w>=3, h>=3) and then each ring subtracts 4, but the condition on k ensures that the dimension after subtracting 4*(k-1) is still at least 3? \n\n            Actually, the condition is k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n            Let m = min(w, h). Then the k-th ring: \n                a_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= w - 4*(floor((m+1)/4)-1)\n\n            But note: the minimal dimension is m, so the k-th ring's dimension is m - 4*(k-1) >= ?\n\n            Since k <= floor((m+1)/4), then:\n\n                4*k <= m+1   [because floor((m+1)/4) is the largest integer <= (m+1)/4, so k <= (m+1)/4 => 4*k <= m+1]\n\n            Then:\n\n                a_k = w - 4*(k-1) >= m - 4*(k-1)   [because m is the minimum, so w>=m]\n\n                and 4*(k-1) <= 4*k - 4 <= (m+1) - 4 = m - 3.\n\n            So a_k >= m - (m-3) = 3.\n\n            Similarly for b_k.\n\n        Therefore, we are guaranteed that for every ring, a_i>=3 and b_i>=3.\n\n        So we can safely use the formula: 2*(a_i+b_i)-4.\n\n   Conclusion: \n\n        Read w, h, k.\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, k+1):\n            a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n            b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n            # Since we know a_i>=3 and b_i>=3, we can use:\n            total += 2*(a_i + b_i) - 4\n\n        Print total.\n\n   Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example1: \"3 3 1\" -> 2*(3+3)-4 = 8 -> correct.\n\n        Example2: \"7 9 1\" -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 28 -> correct.\n\n        Example3: \"7 9 2\" -> \n            i=1: 28, i=2: 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4=12 -> total=40 -> correct.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            exit(0)\n        w = int(data[0])\n        h = int(data[1])\n        k = int(data[2])\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            # i from 0 to k-1: then the ring index is i+1, so we subtract 4*i\n            a_i = w - 4*i\n            b_i = h - 4*i\n            # Since we know a_i>=3 and b_i>=3 for all i in [0, k-1] (by the problem condition), we can use the formula.\n            total += 2 * (a_i + b_i) - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the first ring is the edge (so i=0: subtract 0) and the second ring subtracts 4*(1) for i=1.\n\n   But note: the problem says the i-th ring (starting at i=1) is defined with (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\n   In our loop, we are using i from 0 to k-1, so for the first ring we use i=0: w-0, which is correct.\n\n   But the example \"7 9 2\" uses two rings: \n        i=0: a_i=7, b_i=9 -> 2*(7+9)-4=28\n        i=1: a_i=3, b_i=5 -> 2*(3+5)-4=12\n\n   So yes.\n\n   However, note: the condition for k is given as floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). Our loop runs k times, and we are guaranteed that for i from 0 to k-1, the dimensions are positive and at least 3.\n\n   Therefore, we can output the total.\n\n   But wait, what if the plate is not square? \n\n        Example: w=10, h=5, k= floor((5+1)/4)=1.\n\n        Then we have one ring: a_i=10, b_i=5 -> 2*(10+5)-4=2*15-4=30-4=26.\n\n        Check: a 10x5 grid: \n            top:5, bottom:5, left:8, right:8 -> total=5+5+8+8=26. Correct.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a_i = w - 4*i\n            b_i = h - 4*i\n            total += 2 * (a_i + b_i) - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\n   However, note: the problem condition says the first ring is the edge of the plate, and the second ring is 2 cells away, etc.\n\n   This matches our calculation.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Input: \"3 3 1\" -> 8 -> correct.\n        Input: \"7 9 1\" -> 28 -> correct.\n        Input: \"7 9 2\" -> 40 -> correct.\n\n   But wait, the example input was given as ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2'].\n\n   However, the problem says the input is one line with three integers.\n\n   So we read one line.\n\n   Code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a_i = w - 4*i\n            b_i = h - 4*i\n            total += 2 * (a_i + b_i) - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\n   But wait, the problem condition says k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). We are guaranteed that the inner rectangles are at least 3x3, so no negative and no zero.\n\n   This should be correct.\n\n   However, let me test with the example from the problem: \"7 9 2\" -> 40.\n\n   But wait, the example output is 40.\n\n   One more example: w=3, h=3, k=1 -> 8.\n\n   Another: w=4, h=4, k=1 -> 2*(4+4)-4=8*2-4=16-4=12.\n\n   Check: 4x4 grid: \n        top:4, bottom:4, left:2, right:2 -> 4+4+2+2=12. Correct.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the plate is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is positioned 2 cells away from the previous one, with each ring having a width of 1 cell. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the total number of cells covered by `k` concentric rings. Each ring is defined by the border of an inner rectangle that shrinks by 4 cells in both dimensions (2 cells from each side) for each subsequent ring. \n2. **Key Insight**: For each ring, the dimensions of the inner rectangle are `(w - 4*(i-1))` by `(h - 4*(i-1))`, where `i` is the ring number (starting from 1). The number of cells in each ring is given by the formula `2*(a_i + b_i) - 4`, where `a_i` and `b_i` are the dimensions of the current inner rectangle.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle for that ring, apply the formula to find the number of cells in the ring, and sum these values across all rings.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(k) time, where `k` is the number of rings. Since `k` is bounded by the problem constraints (up to floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)), this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        a_i = w - 4 * i\n        b_i = h - 4 * i\n        total += 2 * (a_i + b_i) - 4\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 0 to `k-1` (using zero-based indexing for simplicity), compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle (`a_i` and `b_i`) by subtracting `4*i` from the original dimensions.\n4. **Calculate Cells per Ring**: Using the formula `2*(a_i + b_i) - 4`, compute the number of cells in the current ring and add it to `total`.\n5. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the geometric properties of concentric rectangles and ensures correctness by adhering to the problem constraints and mathematical formulations.",
