The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to find the longest subsegment such that by changing at most one number (any integer) we can make it strictly increasing.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the entire sequence might already be strictly increasing, then we don't need to change anything and the answer is n.\n 2. Otherwise, we are allowed to change one element. So, we can think of having one \"break\" in the strictly increasing property and fix it by changing one element.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire segment to be strictly increasing without any break, but allows one change anywhere in the segment.\n\n Approach:\n We can use dynamic programming or two pointers? But note: n up to 10^5.\n\n Idea: Let's precompute arrays for strictly increasing sequences from left and right.\n\n Define:\n   left[i]: length of strictly increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (without any change) \n        left[i] = 1 if i==0\n        left[i] = left[i-1] + 1 if a[i] > a[i-1] else 1\n\n Similarly, define right[i]: length of strictly increasing subsegment starting at i going to the right.\n\n Then, consider a segment [l, r] (0-indexed). The condition is that with at most one change, we can fix the entire segment to be strictly increasing.\n\n How can we have a segment with one change? There are a few cases:\n\n Case 1: The entire segment is already strictly increasing. Then we don't need a change.\n\n Case 2: The segment has exactly one violation. Then we can fix by changing one element.\n\n But note: sometimes changing an element might fix two consecutive violations? Actually, we are allowed only one change.\n\n Example: [7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n\n Consider the example: \n   Original array: [7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n   We can take [2,3,1,5,6] (from index1 to index5) and change the 3rd element (index3: which is 1) to 4, making [2,3,4,5,6] which is strictly increasing.\n\n How did we get that? The segment from index1 to index5 has:\n   [2,3] -> increasing, then [3,1] -> decreasing, then [1,5] -> increasing, [5,6] -> increasing.\n\n We fixed the drop at index3 (the '1').\n\n Conditions for a segment to be fixed with one change:\n\n Let the segment be from l to r (inclusive). We can break the segment into two parts: the part before the change and the part after the change.\n\n Conditions for the change to fix the entire segment:\n\n Option 1: Change an element that is not at the boundary (so the segment is split into two strictly increasing parts, and the change must bridge the two).\n\n Specifically, we can consider the following:\n\n   - The segment is [l, r]. We are allowed to change one element at position k (l<=k<=r). Then the entire segment must be strictly increasing.\n\n   How can we check for a candidate segment [l, r]? We can try to see if there is at most one index k in [l, r] such that the condition fails, and that failure can be fixed by changing a[k] to a value that lies between its neighbors.\n\n However, we want the maximum length.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We know that the entire segment must be strictly increasing except for at most one drop. But note: we are allowed to change one element arbitrarily.\n\n Conditions for a segment [l, r] to be fixed with at most one change:\n\n   - If the segment is already strictly increasing, then we are done.\n\n   - Otherwise, we must have exactly one index i in [l, r] such that a[i] <= a[i-1] (if we are considering the entire segment as almost strictly increasing). But wait, note that we can also change the element that is too high to a lower value, so actually the problem is more about having one \"break\" that can be fixed by adjusting one element.\n\n Actually, let's consider:\n\n   Without loss of generality, we can fix the segment by changing one element. Then the entire segment must satisfy:\n\n     For all j from l to r-1: a[j] < a[j+1]   (if no change is needed)\n\n   But when we change one element, say at position k, then we require:\n\n     Condition 1: From l to k-1: strictly increasing.\n     Condition 2: From k+1 to r: strictly increasing.\n     Condition 3: The change at k must bridge the gap: a[k-1] < (new value) < a[k+1] (if k is in the middle). But note, we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsegment of a given sequence where, by changing at most one number, the entire subsegment can be made strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently checking possible subsegments and determining if they meet the criteria with minimal computational overhead.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - **Left Array (`left_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment ending at each index `i`.\n   - **Right Array (`right_arr`)**: This array stores the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment starting at each index `i`.\n\n2. **Check Valid Segments**:\n   - For each element in the sequence, consider it as the potential point where we might change one number. The segment around this element is checked to see if it can be part of a strictly increasing sequence.\n   - The segment is split into three parts: left part (before the changed element), the changed element itself, and the right part (after the changed element). The key is to ensure that the left part ends with a value less than the right part starts with, allowing the changed element to bridge any gap.\n\n3. **Maximize Segment Length**:\n   - For each element, calculate the maximum possible segment length that includes it as the changed element. This involves combining the lengths from the left and right arrays while ensuring the segments can be merged into a strictly increasing sequence with one change.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left_arr[i] = left_arr[i-1] + 1\n            \n    right_arr = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right_arr[i] = right_arr[i+1] + 1\n            \n    ans = max(n, max(left_arr))\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if left_arr[i] == 1:\n            continue\n        prev_val = a[i-1]\n        next_val = a[i+1] if i+1 < n else float('inf')\n        if prev_val < next_val:\n            total = left_arr[i-1] + 1 + right_arr[i+1] if i+1 < n else left_arr[i-1] + 1\n            total = min(total, n)\n            if total > ans:\n                ans = total\n                \n        if i+1 < n:\n            if a[i] > a[i+1]:\n                continue\n            if i-1 >= 0 and a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                total = left_arr[i-1] + 1 + right_arr[i+1]\n                total = min(total, n)\n                if total > ans:\n                    ans = total\n                    \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the sequence length `n` and the sequence `a`.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the sequence has only one element, the answer is trivially `1` since no changes are needed.\n3. **Left and Right Arrays**: These arrays are computed to store the lengths of strictly increasing subsegments ending and starting at each index, respectively.\n4. **Initial Answer**: The initial answer is set to the maximum of `n` (the entire sequence) and the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any changes.\n5. **Segment Validation**: For each element, the algorithm checks if modifying that element allows the surrounding segments to form a longer strictly increasing subsegment. This involves checking the values before and after the element to ensure they can be bridged by a change.\n6. **Output**: The maximum valid segment length found during the checks is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible segments by leveraging precomputed arrays and ensures optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
