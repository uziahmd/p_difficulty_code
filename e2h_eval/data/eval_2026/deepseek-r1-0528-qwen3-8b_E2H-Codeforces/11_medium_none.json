A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n Steps:\n 1. Each bottle has `l` milliliters, so total drink = k * l.\n 2. Each lime is cut into `d` slices, so total lime slices = c * d.\n 3. Total salt = p grams.\n\n For each toast:\n   - Each friend needs `nl` milliliters (so for the entire group, total needed per toast is n * nl? \n     But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\", and they all drink the same amount.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n   Here, n=3 (friends), k=4 (bottles), l=5 (ml per bottle), c=10 (limes), d=8 (slices per lime), p=100 (grams of salt)\n   Each toast requires: \n        drink: nl = 3 ml per friend -> for 3 friends, 9 ml per toast?\n   But wait: the example calculation says: \n        Overall the friends have 20 ml (which is 4*5) and that's enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n   This implies that per toast, the total drink required is 3 ml (not 9). \n\n Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for a toast.\n\n So for one toast, one friend uses nl milliliters. Since there are n friends, then for one toast we need n * nl milliliters? \n But wait, the example: \n        drink: 20 ml, nl=3 -> so if we do 6 toasts, then total drink used would be 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml? That doesn't match.\n\n Actually, the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". \n So they are considering that for one toast, the entire group requires 3 ml? \n\n But the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for a toast. Therefore, for one toast, the entire group (n friends) requires n * nl milliliters.\n\n However, the example calculation does not multiply by n for the drink. It says: \n        drink: 20 ml, and nl=3 (per friend) but then it says 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n This is inconsistent. Let me check the example again:\n\n        Input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\n        They say: \n            drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts.\n\n        Lime: 10*8 = 80 slices -> 80 toasts (each toast requires one slice, and since there are 3 friends, but note: \n            the problem says each toast requires a slice of lime. However, in one toast, how many slices? \n            The problem says \"a slice of lime\" per toast for the entire group? Or per friend?\n\n        The problem states: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\" meaning each friend gets one slice per toast? \n        Then for one toast, the entire group would need 3 slices (because there are 3 friends). \n\n        But the example calculation for lime is 80 toasts. \n\n        Alternatively, if we consider that the entire group shares the lime slices: i.e., one toast requires one slice (for the entire group) then that would explain.\n\n However, the problem says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\", meaning each friend gets one slice. So for one toast, each of the n friends requires one slice. \n Then total slices needed per toast is n.\n\n But wait, the example says: \n        Lime: 10 limes * 8 slices = 80 slices. Then the number of toasts that can be made from lime is 80 / n (since each toast uses n slices)? \n        Then 80 / 3 is about 26.66, which is not matching.\n\n Let me read the example output: \n        \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3\"\n\n They are using 80 as the toast limit from lime. \n\n What if the problem means that one toast (for the entire group) requires one slice? Then the lime constraint is 80 toasts (each toast uses 1 slice). \n But the problem says \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\", meaning that if we have multiple friends, then each toast must provide a slice for each friend.\n\n However, note that the example input has nl=3 (ml per friend) and np=1 (grams of salt per friend). \n\n The example calculation for drink: \n        total_drink = 20 ml, and each toast requires (for the entire group) 3 ml (from the example: 20/3) -> so they are treating nl as the amount per toast for the entire group? \n\n Let me clarify: \n\n Option 1 (as per the example calculation): \n        Drink: total_drink / nl   [nl is 3] -> 20/3 = 6.66 -> floor to 6? \n        Lime: total_slices / 1 (if we assume the entire group toast uses 1 slice) -> 80\n        Salt: total_salt / np (np=1) -> 100/1 = 100\n\n        Then the limiting factor is the drink (6 toasts) and then we divide by the number of friends? Actually, no: because the example says \"min(6,80,100) / 3\".\n\n Why divide by 3? Because the example says: \"the answer is min(6,80,100)/3 = 2\".\n\n But wait, if the entire group makes 6 toasts, then each friend makes 6 / 3 = 2 toasts? \n\n However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice and np grams\" for a toast. \n\n This implies that for one toast per friend, we require:\n        drink: nl ml (per friend) -> so for the entire group, that's n * nl per toast (but wait, the toast is defined per friend?).\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs ... to make a toast\". \n\n But the friends are making toasts together. The condition is that they all drink the same amount. \n\n Alternate interpretation:\n\n We are to determine the maximum number t (number of toasts per friend) such that:\n\n        Total drink used: n * t * nl <= k * l\n        Total lime slices used: n * t * 1 <= c * d   [because each friend needs one slice per toast, so t slices per friend and n*t for the entire group]\n        Total salt used: n * t * np <= p\n\n Then t must be an integer, and we take the maximum t that satisfies all.\n\n Then the answer is t.\n\n Example: \n        n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n\n        Drink: 3*t*3 <= 4*5 -> 9t <= 20 -> t <= 2.22 -> so t<=2\n        Lime: 3*t*1 <= 10*8 -> 3t <= 80 -> t <= 26.66 -> so t<=2\n        Salt: 3*t*1 <= 100 -> 3t <= 100 -> t <= 33.33 -> so t<=2\n\n        Then the answer is 2.\n\n Another sample: \n        Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n        n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n        Drink: 5*t*4 <= 100*10 -> 20t <= 1000 -> t <= 50\n        Lime: 5*t*1 <= 1*19 -> 5t <= 19 -> t <= 3.8 -> so t<=3\n        Salt: 5*t*3 <= 90 -> 15t <= 90 -> t <= 6\n\n        Then the answer is 3.\n\n Third sample: \n        Input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n        n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n        Drink: 10*t*50 <= 1000*1000 -> 500t <= 1000000 -> t <= 2000\n        Lime: 10*t*1 <= 25*23 -> 10t <= 575 -> t <= 57.5 -> so t<=57\n        Salt: 10*t*1 <= 1 -> 10t <= 1 -> t <= 0.1 -> so t=0\n\n        Then the answer is 0.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n        t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [maximum toasts from drink, but note: we are using n * nl per toast for the entire group? Actually, per toast for the entire group we use n * nl? \n        But wait, in our interpretation: \n            Each toast for the entire group (i.e., each friend makes one toast) requires n * nl milliliters.\n\n        Similarly, \n            t2 = (c * d) // (n * 1)   [because each toast for the entire group requires n slices (one per friend)]\n            t3 = p // (n * np)\n\n        Then the maximum t is the minimum of t1, t2, t3.\n\n However, note: we are calculating the maximum number of toasts that the entire group can make (with each friend having t toasts). \n\n But wait: the example calculation did:\n\n        Drink: 20 / 3 (nl) = 6.66 -> but note: 3 is the per-friend requirement, and the entire group requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml per toast? \n        But the example calculation did 20 / 3, not 20 / (n*nl). \n\n Let me reexamine the example:\n\n        In the example, the drink calculation was: 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> 6 toasts.\n\n        According to our new interpretation, the entire group's requirement per toast is 3 (ml per friend) * 3 (friends) = 9 ml.\n\n        Then 20 / 9 = 2.22 -> 2 toasts.\n\n        But the example says 6 toasts.\n\n What's going on?\n\n Let me read the problem statement again: \n\n        \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n        Then, to make a toast, one friend uses nl milliliters. But if we have n friends, and they all make the same number of toasts, then for one toast (by the entire group) we would require n * nl milliliters?\n\n        However, note: the example calculation did not use n * nl for the drink. They used nl (3) to divide the total drink.\n\n        This suggests that the problem might be defining a toast as being for one friend. But then the condition is that all friends drink the same amount, meaning that if we let t be the number of toasts per friend, then the entire group makes t * n toasts? \n\n        But the example output is 2 toasts per friend, meaning that the entire group makes 2 * 3 = 6 toasts.\n\n        Now, for the drink: \n            Each friend makes 2 toasts, so each friend uses 2 * 3 = 6 ml. \n            Entire group uses 3 * 6 = 18 ml. \n            We have 20 ml, so that's okay.\n\n        How does the example calculate the drink limit? \n            They say: 20 ml / 3 ml = 6.66 -> which is the total number of toasts (each toast being for one friend? or for the entire group?)\n\n        Actually, if we consider that a toast is for one friend, then the entire group can have up to 6 toasts (each toast being one friend's toast). \n\n        But then the condition is that all friends drink the same amount, so each friend must have the same number of toasts. \n\n        Therefore, the total number of toasts (across the entire group) must be divisible by n? \n\n        However, the example does not require divisibility because they are calculating per friend: \n\n            total_drink_available = 20 ml\n            Each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml -> so total toasts (across the group) is 20 // 3 = 6 (if we use integer division, but note: 6 toasts for the entire group? then each friend gets 6/3 = 2 toasts)\n\n        So the steps are:\n\n            Let T = total number of toasts (for the entire group) that can be made without considering the per-friend constraint.\n\n            Then, the drink constraint: T * (nl) <= k * l   [because each toast (for one friend) uses nl ml]\n            Lime constraint: T * (1) <= c * d   [each toast uses one lime slice]\n            Salt constraint: T * (np) <= p\n\n            Then, the number of toasts per friend is T / n, and we require that T is divisible by n? \n\n        But wait, the problem says they all drink the same amount. So if T is the total toasts, then each friend must have T/n toasts. T must be divisible by n? \n\n        However, note: we are allowed to have fractional toasts? No, the number of toasts must be an integer. But the problem does not say we can break a toast. \n\n        Actually, we can think: we are going to make T toasts (each toast is for one friend). Then the condition is that T must be divisible by n? \n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n\n            Let t be the number of toasts per friend. Then total toasts T = n * t.\n\n            Constraints become:\n\n                n * t * nl <= k * l\n                n * t * 1 <= c * d\n                n * t * np <= p\n\n            Then t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n*1), p // (n*np) )   [using integer division? but note: we cannot exceed the available resources]\n\n        However, the example: \n            n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1\n\n            t_drink = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2 (if integer division truncates, but 20/9 is 2.22 -> 2)\n            t_lime = (10*8) // (3*1) = 80 // 3 = 26 (if integer division truncates, but 80/3 is 26.66 -> 26)\n            t_salt = 100 // (3*1) = 100 // 3 = 33\n\n            Then t = 2.\n\n        And the second example: \n            n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3\n\n            t_drink = (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n            t_lime = (1*19) // (5*1) = 19 // 5 = 3 (because 19/5=3.8 -> truncated to 3)\n            t_salt = 90 // (5*3) = 90 // 15 = 6\n\n            Then t = 3.\n\n        The third example: \n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1\n\n            t_drink = (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n            t_lime = (25*23) // (10*1) = 575 // 10 = 57\n            t_salt = 1 // (10*1) = 1//10 = 0\n\n            Then t = 0.\n\n        This matches the sample outputs.\n\n        But wait, the example calculation in the problem statement did:\n\n            \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n        Now, 6 toasts (total for the entire group) and then divided by 3 (number of friends) gives 2 toasts per friend.\n\n        However, note: in our calculation we did:\n\n            t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n*1), p // (n*np) )\n\n        Which is:\n\n            t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n        But the example calculation for drink used: total_ml / nl = 20/3 = 6.66 -> then rounded down? But wait, if we do integer division (floor) then 20//3=6.\n\n        Then if we set T = n * t, then the drink constraint would be: T * nl = 3 * 6 = 18 <= 20 -> valid.\n\n        However, we are computing t by dividing the total resource by (n * the per-toast requirement for one friend) and then taking the floor.\n\n        But note: the example calculation for drink was 20/3 (without multiplying by n) and then we floor to 6, and then we say the per-friend toasts is 6/3=2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n            total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, (c*d) // 1, p // np )   [this is the total toasts for the entire group if we ignore the grouping]\n\n            Then, we must have total_toasts divisible by n? Not necessarily, but we want each friend to have the same number of toasts.\n\n            Then the maximum t (toasts per friend) is floor(total_toasts / n) but then we must ensure that the total toasts we use is n*t.\n\n            However, the constraints are:\n\n                n*t*nl <= k*l   -> t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n                n*t*1 <= c*d    -> t <= (c*d) / (n)\n                n*t*np <= p     -> t <= p / (n*np)\n\n            So we are already doing the same.\n\n        But why did the example use 20/3 and not 20/(3*3) for drink? \n\n        Let me explain:\n\n            In the example, they are considering the drink requirement per toast (which is for one friend) is 3 ml. \n            Then the total toasts (for the entire group) that can be made from drink is 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> so 6 toasts.\n\n            Then, since there are 3 friends, each friend can have 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\n        So the two methods are equivalent.\n\n        Method 1 (directly by per-friend constraints):\n\n            t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n), p // (n*np) )\n\n        Method 2 (first compute total toasts, then divide by n):\n\n            total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, (c*d) // 1, p // np )\n            Then, t = total_toasts // n   (but wait, this might not be the same because we are not accounting for the fact that the same t must satisfy all at once)\n\n        Actually, method 2 is flawed because the total_toasts computed by the first way (without considering the entire group) might not be divisible by n, and also the constraints are additive per friend.\n\n        Example: \n            Suppose we have two friends, and drink: 5 ml, nl=1. Then by method 1: \n                t_drink = (5) // (2*1) = 5//2 = 2 (if integer division) -> but wait, 2 toasts per friend would require 2*2*1=4 ml, which is <=5 -> valid.\n\n            By method 2:\n                total_toasts_drink = 5 // 1 = 5\n                total_toasts = 5\n                t = 5 // 2 = 2 -> same.\n\n        But consider: \n            n=2, k=2, l=1, so total_ml=2, nl=1, c=2, d=1, p=2, np=1.\n\n            Method 1:\n                t_drink = 2 // (2*1) = 2//2 = 1\n                t_lime = 2 // 2 = 1\n                t_salt = 2 // 2 = 1\n                t = 1\n\n            Method 2:\n                total_toasts_drink = 2 // 1 = 2\n                total_toasts_lime = 2 // 1 = 2\n                total_toasts_salt = 2 // 1 = 2\n                total_toasts = 2\n                t = 2 // 2 = 1\n\n        It's the same.\n\n        However, note: the constraints are linear. \n\n        But wait, what if the total_toasts is not divisible by n? \n\n        Example: \n            n=2, k=3, l=1, nl=1, c=3, d=1, p=3, np=1.\n\n            Method 1:\n                t_drink = 3 // (2*1) = 3//2 = 1\n                t_lime = 3 // 2 = 1\n                t_salt = 3 // 2 = 1\n                t = 1\n\n            Method 2:\n                total_toasts_drink = 3 // 1 = 3\n                total_toasts_lime = 3 // 1 = 3\n                total_toasts_salt = 3 // 1 = 3\n                total_toasts = 3\n                t = 3 // 2 = 1 (because 3//2 is 1 in integer division)\n\n        But what if we try to use t=1 (so 2 toasts total) and then we have 1 ml of drink left, which is not enough for another toast (which requires 2 ml for two friends? no, wait: per toast (for one friend) requires 1 ml, so two toasts (for two friends) require 2 ml. \n\n        Actually, with t=1 (per friend), we use 2*1*1 = 2 ml (for drink) and we have 3 ml, so we could actually do more than 2 toasts? \n\n        Wait, no: the entire group's toasts: if each friend makes 1 toast, then we have 2 toasts (each toast is for one friend). \n\n        But we can also consider: what if we do 3 toasts? Then we have 3 friends? no, we have 2 friends. \n\n        Actually, the total toasts is 3, which is 1.5 per friend. But the problem requires each friend drinks the same amount. \n\n        So we cannot do 3 toasts because 3 is not divisible by 2. \n\n        Therefore, the maximum t is 1.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for a toast. So if we have 3 toasts, then one friend would have 2 toasts and the other 1? which violates the condition.\n\n        So we must have t such that n*t is an integer (which it is) and we use exactly n*t toasts.\n\n        Therefore, the two methods are consistent.\n\n        However, the example calculation in the problem statement used the first method (dividing the total resource by the per-friend requirement, and then the entire group's total toasts is the sum over friends, but note: the drink per toast is per friend).\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n*1), p // (n*np) )\n\n        But note: the division must be integer division (floor) because we cannot use fractions of a toast.\n\n        However, what if we don't use integer division? \n\n        Example: n=2, k=3, l=1, nl=1 -> (k*l)=3, n*nl=2 -> 3/2=1.5, then we take floor(1.5)=1 -> correct.\n\n        But what if we use real numbers and then take the floor? \n\n        Actually, we should use floor division because we can only use whole toasts.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify if we can break a toast. We assume we cannot.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)   [if we use integer division, but note: if (k*l) is not divisible by (n*nl) then we take floor]\n\n        But wait: if we do (k*l) / (n*nl) and then take the integer part (floor), that is the same as integer division.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: if (k*l) is less than (n*nl) then the division will be 0.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n), p // (n*np) )\n\n        But note: the division by n might cause issues if n*nl is 0, but n>=1.\n\n        However, there is a catch: if we use integer division, then (k*l) // (n*nl) is the floor of (k*l)/(n*nl). \n\n        But in Python, for positive integers, // is floor division.\n\n        But note: the constraints say that the numbers are positive and not less than 1, so we are safe.\n\n        However, we must be cautious with the order of operations: \n\n            n * nl might be large, but the numbers are at most 1000, so n*nl is at most 1000*1000 = 1e6, and k*l is at most 1000*1000 = 1e6, so the division is safe.\n\n        But what if n*nl is larger than k*l? Then (k*l)//(n*nl) is 0, which is correct.\n\n        Similarly for the others.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            Read the input: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n\n            t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)   # drink: total ml / (ml per entire-group toast) but wait, no: we are using n*nl per entire-group toast? \n            Actually, wait: in our interpretation, the entire group's requirement per toast (each friend having one toast) is n * nl. \n\n            But note: the example calculated the drink constraint by dividing total_ml by nl (the per-friend requirement) and got the total toasts for the entire group.\n\n            In our direct method for t (per friend), we are using:\n\n                t = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n), p // (n*np) )\n\n            This is because for one toast per friend, the entire group uses n * nl ml.\n\n        However, let me compare:\n\n            In the example: \n                total_ml = 20, per entire-group toast (each friend having one toast) requires 3 (ml per friend) * 3 friends = 9 ml.\n\n            Then the entire-group toast count from drink: 20 // 9 = 2 (if we use floor). Then the per-friend toasts is 2 (because each entire-group toast is one toast per friend).\n\n            But wait, that matches: t=2.\n\n            Alternatively, if we think of the entire-group toast as one event that serves all friends, then the requirement is n*nl per entire-group toast.\n\n            Then the entire-group toast count is T = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n            Then the per-friend toasts is T (because each entire-group toast is one toast for each friend).\n\n            So we can also do:\n\n                T = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // (n), p // (n*np) )\n                Then the answer is T.\n\n            But wait, in the example: \n                T_drink = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2\n                T_lime = 80 // 3 = 26\n                T_salt = 100 // 3 = 33\n                Then T=2.\n\n            This is the same.\n\n        However, note: the example calculation in the problem statement did:\n\n            Drink: 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> 6 entire-group toasts? \n\n            But wait, if one entire-group toast requires 9 ml, then 20 ml allows 2 entire-group toasts (2*9=18 <=20, and 3*9=27>20). \n\n            So the entire-group toast count is 2, meaning each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\n        But wait, the example says: \"min(6,80,100)/3 = 2\"\n\n        They are computing:\n\n            Drink: 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> 6 (entire-group toasts? no, because 6 entire-group toasts would require 6 * 9 = 54 ml, which is too much) \n\n        Actually, the example calculation was:\n\n            \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n        Here, they are treating a toast as one friend's toast. So 6 toasts (each for one friend) for the entire group. Then, since there are 3 friends, we divide by 3 to get 2 toasts per friend.\n\n        So the entire-group toast count (if we define a toast as one friend's toast) is 6, and then we divide by the number of friends to get the per-friend toast count.\n\n        But wait, then the constraints are:\n\n            Let t be the number of toasts per friend.\n\n            Then the entire-group has n * t toasts (each toast being one friend's toast).\n\n            Then:\n\n                n * t * nl <= k * l\n                n * t * 1 <= c * d\n                n * t * np <= p\n\n            This is the same as before.\n\n        So both ways are equivalent.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            t = min( (k * l) // (n * nl), (c * d) // (n * 1), p // (n * np) )\n\n        But note: the lime constraint: we require n * t slices (because each of the n friends requires one slice per toast). \n\n        However, we must be cautious: if we use integer division, then we are taking the floor. \n\n        Example: if (c*d) is not divisible by n, then we are effectively limiting the entire-group toasts (which is n*t) by (c*d) // n.\n\n        But note: (c*d) // n is the maximum t (per friend) that we can have from limes, because n*t <= c*d -> t <= (c*d) / n -> and we take the floor.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = data\n\n            # Calculate the maximum number of toasts per friend from drink, lime, and salt.\n            # Each toast for one friend requires nl ml, so for the entire group (n friends) toasting t times: n*t*nl <= k*l\n            # Similarly for lime: n*t*1 <= c*d, and salt: n*t*np <= p.\n\n            # Therefore, the maximum t is the minimum of:\n            #   (k*l) // (n*nl)   [because n*t <= (k*l) // nl -> but wait, no: we have n*t*nl <= k*l -> t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)]\n            #   (c*d) // (n)       [because n*t <= c*d -> t <= (c*d) / n]\n            #   p // (n*np)        [because n*t*np <= p -> t <= p / (n*np)]\n\n            # But note: these divisions are integer divisions (floor) because we cannot have a fraction of a toast.\n\n            t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n            t_lime = (c * d) // (n * 1)   # but wait, we are dividing by n, but the requirement per toast (for the entire group) is n slices? \n            # Actually, we have two interpretations for lime: \n            #   Interpretation 1: one toast (for the entire group) requires n slices. Then the entire-group toast count is limited by (c*d) // n.\n            #   Then the per-friend toasts is the entire-group toast count (if we define entire-group toast as one toast per friend) but wait, no: the entire-group toast count (if defined as the total toasts for the group) is n*t. \n            #   And we are computing t from: n*t <= (c*d) / 1 -> so t <= (c*d) / n.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can think: \n            #   We have c*d slices. Each toast (for one friend) requires 1 slice. So the entire group can have at most (c*d) toasts (if we ignore the grouping). But then we require that the entire group's toasts is divisible by n? \n\n            # However, note: the condition is that each friend has the same number of toasts. So the total toasts (for the entire group) must be divisible by n? \n\n            # But wait, the above method does not require divisibility because we are setting t to be the maximum integer such that n*t <= c*d, etc.\n\n            # So the above formula is correct.\n\n            t_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n            t = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\n            print(t)\n\n        However, wait: in the example, the drink calculation: \n            t_drink = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2\n\n        But the example did: 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> then 6 toasts for the entire group (meaning each friend 2 toasts). \n\n        So our t_drink is the per-friend toasts, which is 2.\n\n        But note: the example calculation for drink did 20 / 3, not 20 / (3*3). \n\n        Why did we use 3*3? \n\n        Because the entire group's requirement per toast (for one friend) is 3 ml, but when we have n friends, the entire group's requirement for one toast (each friend having one toast) is n * nl = 3*3 = 9 ml.\n\n        Alternatively, if we consider that the entire group's requirement for one toast (each friend having one toast) is 9 ml, then the entire-group toast count (each entire-group toast is one toast per friend) is (k*l) // (n*nl) = 20//9=2.\n\n        Then the per-friend toasts is 2.\n\n        The example calculation for drink was: 20 / 3 = 6.66 -> 6, and then divided by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2.\n\n        So we can also compute:\n\n            total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, (c*d) // 1, p // np )   # because each toast (for one friend) requires nl ml, so total toasts (for the entire group)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to ensure that all friends drink the same amount, and the constraints of drink, lime slices, and salt are respected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The solution involves checking three main constraints:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total milliliters of drink available must be enough for each friend's requirement per toast.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total number of lime slices available must be enough for each friend's requirement per toast.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total grams of salt available must be enough for each friend's requirement per toast.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each friend to make `t` toasts, the entire group (n friends) will consume `n * t * nl` milliliters of drink, `n * t` lime slices, and `n * t * np` grams of salt. The maximum `t` is determined by the most restrictive of these three constraints.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves computing the maximum possible `t` for each constraint using integer division (to ensure whole numbers) and then taking the minimum of these values. This ensures that all constraints are satisfied simultaneously.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1), suitable for the given input constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = data\n    \n    t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    t_lime = (c * d) // (n * 1)\n    t_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    t = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n    print(t)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers: the number of friends (n), bottles of drink (k), milliliters per bottle (l), number of limes (c), slices per lime (d), grams of salt (p), milliliters per friend per toast (nl), and grams of salt per friend per toast (np).\n\n2. **Calculating Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint (t_drink)**: Total drink available (k * l) divided by the drink required per entire-group toast (n * nl). This gives the maximum number of toasts per friend based on drink availability.\n   - **Lime Constraint (t_lime)**: Total lime slices available (c * d) divided by the number of friends (n), since each friend needs one slice per toast. This gives the maximum number of toasts per friend based on lime availability.\n   - **Salt Constraint (t_salt)**: Total salt available (p) divided by the salt required per entire-group toast (n * np). This gives the maximum number of toasts per friend based on salt availability.\n\n3. **Determining Result**: The minimum of the three calculated values (t_drink, t_lime, t_salt) is the answer, as it ensures all constraints are met without exceeding any resource limit.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and computes the result using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
