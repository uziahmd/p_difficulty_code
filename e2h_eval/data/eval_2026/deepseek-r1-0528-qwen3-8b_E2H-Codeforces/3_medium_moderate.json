Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering the gaps between lanterns and the ends.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n 2. The entire street must be covered from 0 to l.\n 3. Consider two parts: \n    a) The left end: from 0 to the first lantern.\n    b) The right end: from the last lantern to l.\n    c) The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n 4. For the left end: we need at least (first lantern's position) / 2 to cover from 0 to the first lantern.\n    But note: if the first lantern is at position a0, then the radius needed to cover from 0 to a0 is a0/2.\n\n 5. For the right end: we need (l - last lantern's position) / 2.\n\n 6. For the gaps between consecutive lanterns (after sorting): \n    Between two consecutive lanterns at positions a[i] and a[i+1]:\n        The gap length is (a[i+1] - a[i]).\n        To cover this gap, we need a radius that covers from a[i] to a[i+1]. \n        The minimum radius required for the gap is (gap_length)/2.\n\n    However, note that the lanterns can overlap. Actually, if we have two lanterns, the first one lights up to a[i] + d and the next from a[i+1] - d.\n    To have no gap, we require: a[i] + d >= a[i+1] - d   =>  2*d >= (a[i+1] - a[i])   => d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n 7. But wait, what if we have more than two lanterns? We can actually use the idea of covering the entire street by ensuring that the maximum of the following is covered:\n\n    However, note that the requirement for the entire street is that the union of intervals [x_i - d, x_i + d] must cover [0, l].\n\n 8. We can break the problem into:\n    - The leftmost point is 0. The first lantern at a0 must cover from 0 to at least a0-d <= 0? Actually, we need to extend from 0 to a0+d. So the distance from 0 to a0 must be <= 2*d? Actually, the first lantern must cover 0: so we require d >= a0 (if we consider only the first lantern). But wait, maybe we can use multiple lanterns? \n\n    Let me re-think:\n\n    Actually, we can consider the entire street as segments that must be covered. We can also note that the minimum d must be at least max( left_end_gap, right_end_gap, middle_gaps )\n\n    Where:\n        left_end_gap = a0 - 0   -> requires d >= (a0)/2? Actually, no: the first lantern must reach from 0 to a0. The farthest point from the first lantern on the left is 0. So the distance from the first lantern to 0 is a0. Then we require d >= a0 (to cover 0). But wait, if we have two lanterns, then the first lantern might not have to cover the entire a0 if there's another lantern in the middle? \n\n    Actually, the idea is to cover the entire street. We can use all the lanterns.\n\n    Another approach is to consider the coverage as:\n\n        The entire street [0, l] is covered if:\n          0 is within d of some lantern (so there exists a lantern at a_i such that a_i - d <= 0 <= a_i + d) -> but note we don't know which lantern.\n\n    However, we can think greedily:\n\n        Sort the lantern positions: let them be a0, a1, ... a_{n-1}.\n\n        We want to find the minimal d such that:\n\n          The first lantern covers from a0 - d to a0 + d. But we require the entire street from 0 to l.\n\n        We can traverse the street from left to right and ensure that the current coverage extends sufficiently.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note:\n\n          The whole street must be covered. The critical points are:\n\n          - The start: 0 must be covered by the leftmost part of the first lantern or by the second? Actually, the first lantern must extend from 0 to the first lantern's position. The required d for the left side is (max(0, a0) )? Actually, the left edge: we require that the first lantern (or the combination) reaches 0. The first lantern is at a0, so the distance from 0 to a0 is a0. Therefore, to cover 0, we require d >= a0 (if we only use the first lantern). But wait, if we have multiple lanterns, maybe the first lantern doesn't have to cover the entire a0? \n\n        Actually, the condition for the left end is: the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The distance from 0 to the first lantern is a0, so we need d >= a0 (because the lantern at a0 will cover from a0-d to a0+d. To cover 0, we require a0 - d <= 0 -> d >= a0). But wait, if we have two lanterns, the first lantern at a0 and the second at a1, then the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least a0-d, and the second lantern must cover from a1-d to a1+d. However, the gap between a0 and a1 must be bridged by the two lanterns.\n\n        Actually, the correct way is to consider the gaps and the ends independently.\n\n        Let me define:\n\n          candidate1 = a0 / 2.0   # because from 0 to the first lantern, the first lantern must cover half of that gap (if we put the center at a0, then to cover 0 we need d >= a0, but wait: actually, the condition for the left end is that the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a0, so we require d >= a0. However, if we have two lanterns, we might use the first lantern to cover half and the second to cover the other half? \n\n        But note: the same d is used for every lantern. \n\n        Actually, the requirement for the left end is: we need the first lantern to cover from 0 to a0. The maximum distance from the first lantern to the left end is a0, so d must be at least a0. However, if we have two lanterns, then the first lantern might not be the only one that covers the left end. But wait, the street is from 0 to l, and the first lantern is the closest to 0. So the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. Therefore, d must be at least a0.\n\n        But wait, consider the sample: \"2 5\\n2 5\". The lanterns are at 2 and 5. The street is from 0 to 5.\n\n        For the left end: from 0 to 2. The first lantern at 2 must cover 0, so d must be at least 2. However, the example output is 2.0, so that matches.\n\n        Now consider the middle: between 2 and 5. The gap is 3. The two lanterns must together cover the gap. The first lantern (at 2) covers up to 2+d, and the second (at 5) covers from 5-d. We require 2+d >= 5-d -> 2d >= 3 -> d>=1.5. But our d=2 is >=1.5, so it works.\n\n        Now consider the right end: from 5 to 5? Actually, the street ends at 5. The second lantern at 5 must cover up to 5+d, but since the street ends at 5, we require 5-d <= 5 (which is always true) and the coverage from 5-d to 5+d must include 5. The condition for the right end is: d must be at least (5-5)=0, so no additional constraint.\n\n        However, wait: the entire street is [0,5]. The first lantern at 2 with d=2 covers [0,4]. The second lantern at 5 with d=2 covers [3,7]. The union [0,4] ∪ [3,7] covers [0,7] which certainly includes [0,5]. So why did the example say 2.0?\n\n        But note: the problem says the street has length l=5. So the right end is 5. The second lantern at 5 must cover from 5-d to 5+d. To cover the point 5, we don't need to go beyond 5. However, the entire street is from 0 to 5, so we need to cover 5. The second lantern at 5 naturally covers 5 (since 5 is at the center and d>=0). But what if the second lantern was at 4.9? Then we would need d>=0.1 for the right end.\n\n        Actually, the condition for the right end is: the last lantern must cover the point l. The last lantern is at a_{n-1}. The distance from the last lantern to l is (l - a_{n-1]). Therefore, we require d >= (l - a_{n-1]).\n\n        Similarly, the left end requires d >= a0.\n\n        And for the gaps: between two consecutive lanterns, we require d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2.\n\n        Then the minimal d is the maximum of these three values:\n\n            d1 = a0   (from the left end)\n            d2 = l - a[-1] (from the right end)\n            d3 = max( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2 for all i from 0 to n-2 )\n\n        Then answer = max(d1, d2, d3)\n\n        Let's test with the sample: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n            d1 = 2 (a0=2)\n            d2 = 5-5 = 0\n            d3 = (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n            Then max(2,0,1.5) = 2.0 -> correct.\n\n        Another sample: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n            First sort the list: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n            d1 = 0 (from 0) -> but wait, the first element is 0. Then d1 = 0? That doesn't sound right.\n\n        Wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then the left end is already covered (since 0 is at the beginning). Then d1 should be 0.\n\n        But wait, what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the left end is 0, and the lantern at 0 covers from -d to d. Since the street starts at 0, we only care from 0 to l. The coverage from 0 to d is provided by the lantern at 0. So the left end condition: we require the lanterns to cover 0. Since there's a lantern at 0, we don't need any extra d for the left. But note: if there's a lantern at 0, then the left end is covered as long as d>=0, which is trivial.\n\n        However, the condition for the left end is: the first lantern must cover from 0 to the first lantern. The distance from 0 to the first lantern (0) is 0, so d must be at least 0. Similarly, the right end: the last lantern is at 15, so the distance from 15 to l (which is 15) is 0.\n\n        Now, the gaps:\n\n            [0,3]: gap=3 -> requires d >= 3/2 = 1.5\n            [3,5]: gap=2 -> requires d>=1\n            [5,7]: gap=2 -> requires d>=1\n            [7,9]: gap=2 -> requires d>=1\n            [9,14]: gap=5 -> requires d>=2.5\n            [14,15]: gap=1 -> requires d>=0.5\n\n        Then the maximum is max(0,0,1.5,1,1,1,2.5,0.5) = 2.5 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, what if we have multiple lanterns at the same point? The problem says: \"Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point.\" \n\n        Example: \"3 10\\n0 0 10\"\n\n            Sort: [0,0,10]\n            d1 = 0\n            d2 = 10-10=0\n            gaps: [0,0] -> gap 0, [0,10] -> gap 10 -> requires d>=5.\n\n            Then answer = 5.\n\n        This makes sense: the two lanterns at 0 will cover from -5 to 5 (if d=5) and the one at 10 will cover from 5 to 15. Together they cover [0,10] (the street from 0 to 10). The gap between the last lantern at 0 and the next at 10 is 10, so we need d>=5.\n\n        However, note: the two lanterns at 0 are redundant for the left end, but they help in the middle? Actually, the two lanterns at 0: the first two are both at 0. The coverage from 0 is [0-d, 0+d] = [-d, d]. The next lantern at 10 requires [10-d, 10+d]. To bridge the gap from d to 10-d, we require d >= 10-d -> 2d>=10 -> d>=5.\n\n        Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n        However, note: the left end condition is defined as the distance from 0 to the first lantern. In the sorted array, the first lantern is at 0, so the condition for the left end is 0. Similarly, the right end is 0.\n\n        But wait, what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then we require d >= first_lantern_position.\n\n        What if we have a lantern at 0 and then the next at 5, and the street ends at 10? Then:\n\n            d1 = 0 (from 0 to first lantern is 0)\n            d2 = 10-5 = 5\n            gaps: [0,5] -> gap 5 -> requires d>=2.5\n\n            Then answer = max(0,5,2.5)=5.\n\n        Why 5? Because the right end requires that the last lantern (at 5) must cover 10, so d>=5. Then the entire street is covered from 0 (by the first lantern with d=5: covers [-5,5]) and the second lantern (at 5) covers [0,10]. So the entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n        But wait, the gap between 0 and 5 is 5, and with d=5, the first lantern covers from 0 to 5 (actually from -5 to 5) and the second from 0 to 10. So the gap is covered.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n          Read n, l\n          Read the list of n integers (lantern positions)\n\n          Sort the list\n\n          Let gaps = []\n\n          Consider the left end: d_left = lantern[0]   (because the first lantern must cover from 0 to lantern[0], so d must be at least lantern[0])\n\n          Consider the right end: d_right = l - lantern[-1]\n\n          Consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns: \n            For i from 0 to n-2:\n                gap = lantern[i+1] - lantern[i]\n                d_gap = gap / 2.0   # because we need d such that the two adjacent lanterns' coverage just meet: (current + d) >= (next - d)  => d >= gap/2\n\n          Then the answer is the maximum of d_left, d_right, and all d_gap.\n\n        However, wait: is the left end condition really lantern[0]? \n\n        Actually, the first lantern is at lantern[0]. The distance from 0 to lantern[0] is lantern[0]. To cover 0, we require the first lantern to have d at least lantern[0] (so that the coverage from the first lantern includes 0). But note: if we have multiple lanterns, the condition for the left end might be satisfied by a lantern that is not the first? \n\n        However, the first lantern is the one closest to 0. The condition for the left end is that the entire segment from 0 to the first lantern must be covered. The first lantern at position a0 will cover from a0-d to a0+d. To cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0. Since d is nonnegative, we have d >= a0.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a lantern at a0 and then another lantern at a1 (with a1>a0) that is closer to 0? No, because we sorted the lanterns, so a0 is the smallest.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the left end is not necessarily that the first lantern must have d>=a0. Actually, the entire street must be covered. The left end is 0. The first lantern at a0 must cover 0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is a0, so the condition is d >= a0.\n\n        Similarly, for the right end: the last lantern must cover l, so the distance from the last lantern to l is (l - lantern[-1]), so d >= (l - lantern[-1]).\n\n        For the gaps: the gap between two consecutive lanterns (say at a_i and a_{i+1}) is (a_{i+1}-a_i). To cover the gap, we require that the two adjacent lanterns' coverage overlap. The left lantern covers up to a_i + d, and the right lantern covers from a_{i+1} - d. We require a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d -> d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)/2.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n            left_gap = lantern[0]   (if we consider that the first lantern must cover from 0 to itself, then the required d is at least the distance from 0 to the first lantern, which is lantern[0])\n            right_gap = l - lantern[-1]\n            and the mid_gap = max( (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2 ) for i in range(n-1)\n\n        However, wait: in the left end, the condition is that the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. The distance from 0 to a0 is a0, so the required d is a0. Similarly, the right end requires d>= (l - a_{last}).\n\n        But note: the same d is used for all lanterns. Therefore, we must have d at least as big as the maximum of:\n\n            - The left end condition: a0\n            - The right end condition: l - a_{last}\n            - The mid gaps: (gaps)/2\n\n        However, consider a scenario where the first lantern is at 0, then the left end condition is 0. But what if there is a gap of 10 between the first lantern (at 0) and the next (at 10)? Then the mid gap condition requires d>=5. And if the street ends at 20, then the right end condition is 20-10=10. Then the answer is max(0,10,5)=10.\n\n        This makes sense: the first lantern at 0 must cover from 0 to 10? Actually, no: the first lantern at 0 with d=10 covers from -10 to 10, so the gap from 0 to 10 is covered by the first lantern (until 10) and the next lantern at 10 covers from 0 to 20 (if d=10). But wait, the next lantern at 10 is covered by the first lantern? Actually, the first lantern at 0 with d=10 covers up to 10, so the next lantern at 10 is already covered by the first lantern. However, the condition for the right end is that the last lantern (at 10) must cover 20, so d>=10.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n          Sort the list of lanterns.\n\n          candidates = []\n\n          # Left end: from 0 to the first lantern\n          candidates.append(lanterns[0])\n\n          # Right end: from the last lantern to l\n          candidates.append(l - lanterns[-1])\n\n          # Middle gaps: between consecutive lanterns\n          for i in range(len(lanterns)-1):\n              gap = lanterns[i+1] - lanterns[i]\n              # The minimal d to cover this gap is gap/2\n              candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n          Then answer = max(candidates)\n\n        But wait: is the left end condition correctly represented by 'lanterns[0]'? \n\n        Example: n=1, l=10, lantern at [5]. Then:\n          Left end: 5\n          Right end: 10-5 = 5\n          Middle gaps: none.\n\n          Then answer = 5.\n\n        With one lantern at 5, we require d>=5 to cover from 0 to 10? \n          The lantern at 5 with d=5 covers [0,10] (since 5-5=0, 5+5=10). Correct.\n\n        Example: n=1, l=10, lantern at [0]\n          Left end: 0\n          Right end: 10-0=10\n          Then answer=10.\n\n        This is correct: the lantern at 0 must cover from 0 to 10, so d>=10.\n\n        Example: n=1, l=10, lantern at [10]\n          Left end: 10\n          Right end: 0\n          Then answer=10.\n\n        Example: n=2, l=10, lanterns at [0,10]\n          Left end: 0\n          Right end: 0\n          Middle gap: (10-0)/2 = 5\n          Then answer=5.\n\n        This is correct: the two lanterns at 0 and 10 must have d>=5 to cover the entire street.\n\n        Therefore, code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the street is from 0 to l. The lanterns can be at the ends. Our conditions hold.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints: n can be 1 to 1000, and l up to 10^9.\n\n        We must be cautious with floating point and precision.\n\n        Since the problem allows absolute or relative error <= 1e-9, we can use float and formatting.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          n, l = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          arr.sort()\n\n          candidates = []\n\n          # Left end: the distance from 0 to the first lantern\n          candidates.append(arr[0])\n\n          # Right end: the distance from the last lantern to l\n          candidates.append(l - arr[-1])\n\n          # Middle gaps\n          for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n              gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n              # The required d for this gap is gap/2\n              candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n          ans = max(candidates)\n\n          Print ans with 10 decimal places.\n\n        However, wait: what if there is only one lantern? Then the middle gaps loop won't run, and we have two candidates: [arr[0], l-arr[-1]].\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n          Sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n          candidates = [0, 15-15=0, then gaps: (3-0)/2=1.5, (5-3)/2=1, (7-5)/2=1, (9-7)/2=1, (14-9)/2=2.5, (15-14)/2=0.5]\n\n          Then max(candidates) = max(0,0,1.5,1,1,1,2.5,0.5) = 2.5 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n          Sorted: [2,5]\n          candidates = [2, 5-5=0, (5-2)/2=1.5] -> max(2,0,1.5)=2 -> correct.\n\n        Example 3: \"3 10\\n0 0 10\"\n          Sorted: [0,0,10]\n          candidates = [0, 10-10=0, (0-0)/2=0, (10-0)/2=5] -> max(0,0,0,5)=5 -> correct.\n\n        Example 4: \"1 10\\n5\"\n          candidates = [5, 10-5=5] -> max(5,5)=5 -> correct.\n\n        Example 5: \"1 10\\n0\"\n          candidates = [0, 10] -> 10 -> correct.\n\n        Example 6: \"1 10\\n10\"\n          candidates = [10, 0] -> 10 -> correct.\n\n        Example 7: \"2 10\\n0 10\"\n          candidates = [0,0,5] -> 5 -> correct.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n          n, l = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          arr.sort()\n          candidates = [arr[0], l - arr[-1]]\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n              # But note: we are already including the left and right ends, so we consider the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n              # However, we did above from index0 to index1, etc. But in the above example we considered each consecutive gap.\n              # But wait, in the example above we considered from 0 to n-1, but here we are iterating from 1 to n (exclusive of n? no, range(1, n) goes from 1 to n-1). So we are missing the first gap? Actually, no: we built the list of gaps from the entire sorted array.\n\n          Actually, the above code for the gaps uses a loop from i=0 to n-2 (if we do range(len(arr)-1)). But in the example above I wrote:\n\n            for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n                gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n\n          But in the code above I wrote:\n\n            for i in range(1, n):\n\n          That's incorrect. Because n is the number of lanterns, and the array has n elements. Then the gaps are from i=0 to n-2, so we should iterate from 0 to n-2.\n\n          Correction: use the length of the array.\n\n          Since the problem says the input has n integers, and we read n, then the array has n elements.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          n, l = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          arr.sort()\n          candidates = [arr[0], l - arr[-1]]\n          for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n              gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n              candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n          But wait, in the example above we considered the gaps in the order of the array. However, the condition for the gap between arr[i-1] and arr[i] is (arr[i]-arr[i-1])/2.\n\n          But note: the above code for the gap calculation uses the consecutive elements. However, in the previous version we did:\n\n            for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n                gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n\n          That is the same as:\n\n            for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                gap = arr[i] - arr[i-1]\n\n          But wait, no: \n\n            In the first method: i from 0 to len(arr)-2, then gap = arr[i+1]-arr[i]\n\n            In the second: i from 1 to len(arr)-1, then gap = arr[i]-arr[i-1]\n\n          They are the same set of gaps.\n\n          However, note: the problem does not require the gaps to be computed in any particular order, and we are taking the maximum, so it doesn't matter.\n\n          But let me fix the code to use the correct indexing.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          candidates = [arr[0], l - arr[-1]]\n          for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n              gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n              candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n          This is the same.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that multiple lanterns can be at the same point. Then gap might be 0, which is okay.\n\n        Let me test with two lanterns at the same point:\n\n          n=2, l=10, arr=[5,5]\n\n          candidates = [5, 10-5=5, gap=0 -> 0/2=0] -> max(5,5,0)=5 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n          n, l = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          arr.sort()\n          candidates = [arr[0], l - arr[-1]]\n          for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n              gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n              candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n          ans = max(candidates)\n\n          print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n        However, wait: the problem input is given as a string that may contain multiple lines. The example input is given as:\n\n          ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n        But in the actual input, we read from stdin.\n\n        We are reading:\n\n          first_line = input().split()\n          n = int(first_line[0]); l = int(first_line[1])\n          second_line = input().split()\n          arr = list(map(int, second_line))\n\n        This is standard.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n          Input: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\" -> output 2.5000000000\n          Input: \"2 5\\n2 5\" -> output 2.0000000000\n\n        It works.\n\n        But wait, there's an alternative solution that considers:\n\n          The entire street is covered if the maximum of the following is minimized:\n\n          - The distance from 0 to the first lantern (which is arr[0]) must be <= d (so d>=arr[0])\n          - The distance from the last lantern to l must be <= d (so d>=l-arr[-1])\n          - The gaps between consecutive lanterns: for each i, the gap is arr[i+1]-arr[i]. The minimal d for the gap is (arr[i+1]-arr[i])/2.\n\n          Then the answer is the maximum of these.\n\n        This is exactly what we did.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the answer must be accurate to 1e-9. Using float division and then formatting to 10 decimal places should be acceptable.\n\n        Let me test with a large number: n=1, l=10**9, arr=[0] -> then d=10**9, which is a float and we print with 10 decimals.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Code:\n\n          n, l = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          arr.sort()\n          candidates = [arr[0], l - arr[-1]]\n          for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n              gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n              candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n          ans = max(candidates)\n\n          print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n        But wait: is the condition for the left end correct? \n\n        Actually, the left end condition is: the first lantern must cover 0. The distance from the first lantern to 0 is arr[0]. Therefore, we require d >= arr[0]. Similarly, for the right end: d >= l - arr[-1].\n\n        And for the gaps: d >= (arr[i+1]-arr[i])/2.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the left end is that the entire segment from 0 to the first lantern must be covered. The first lantern covers from arr[0]-d to arr[0]+d. We require that 0 is in [arr[0]-d, arr[0]+d]. Since arr[0]>=0, then the left boundary is arr[0]-d. We require arr[0]-d <= 0 -> d>=arr[0].\n\n        Similarly, the right end: the last lantern covers from arr[-1]-d to arr[-1]+d. We require l is in that interval, so arr[-1]+d >= l -> d>=l-arr[-1].\n\n        And for a gap between two lanterns: the first lantern covers up to arr[i]+d, and the next lantern covers from arr[i+1]-d. We require arr[i]+d >= arr[i+1]-d -> d>= (arr[i+1]-arr[i])/2.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the maximum of these requirements.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        Let me submit the code.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the lanterns can be at the same point. Our code handles that because if two consecutive lanterns are at the same point, then gap=0, and we append 0, which doesn't change the maximum.\n\n        One more test: n=0? But the problem says n>=1.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Code:\n\n          n, l = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          arr.sort()\n          candidates = [arr[0], l - arr[-1]]\n          # If there is only one lantern, then the for loop won't run (range(len(arr)-1) is 0 to 0, so no iteration) -> correct.\n          for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n              gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n              candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n          ans = max(candidates)\n\n          print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the street ends to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is a straight line from `0` to `l`, with `n` lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the segment from `0` to its position. The required `d` here is the position of the first lantern (since `d` must be at least the distance from `0` to the first lantern).\n   - **Right End Coverage**: Similarly, the last lantern must cover the segment from its position to `l`. The required `d` here is `l` minus the position of the last lantern.\n   - **Middle Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined light. The minimal `d` needed for each gap is half the distance between the two lanterns.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the list of lantern positions to easily compute the left and right end conditions and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - Calculate three types of values: the left end condition, the right end condition, and the maximum value among the gaps' conditions.\n   - The answer is the maximum of these three values, ensuring all segments of the street are covered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    arr.sort()\n    candidates = [arr[0], l - arr[-1]]\n    \n    for i in range(len(arr)-1):\n        gap = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n        candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n        \n    ans = max(candidates)\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the calculation of coverage requirements.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**:\n   - **Left End**: The distance from `0` to the first lantern is `arr[0]`, so `d` must be at least this value.\n   - **Right End**: The distance from the last lantern to `l` is `l - arr[-1]`, so `d` must be at least this value.\n   - **Gaps**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is `arr[i+1] - arr[i]`. The minimal `d` to cover this gap is half this distance.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value among all these candidates gives the minimal `d` required to cover the entire street. The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.",
