Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers: a (initial candles) and b (number of used candles needed to make a new one)\n Initially, we have 'a' candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a used candle.\n Additionally, we can combine 'b' used candles to create a new one.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We start by lighting all the candles we have (initially 'a').\n 2. We use each candle for one hour, so we get 'a' hours and then we have 'a' used candles.\n 3. Then, we can form new candles from the used ones: floor(a / b) new candles, and we will have leftover_used = a % b used candles.\n\n However, note that the process can be continued until we don't have enough used candles to form a new one.\n\n Alternate approach:\n Let total_hours = 0\n Let current_candles = a\n Let leftover = 0\n\n But note: when we burn a candle, we get one used candle per candle. And we can use the used candles to form more.\n\n Actually, we can think of it as:\n total_hours += current_candles   (burning all current candles)\n Then, we get current_candles used candles. Then, we can convert some of them into new candles.\n\n However, we must account for leftovers. The process:\n\n Step 0: \n   current = a\n   used_so_far = 0\n   total = 0\n\n But actually, we can simulate:\n\n   hours = 0\n   current = a\n   while current > 0:\n        hours += current   # because we burn all current candles\n        # After burning, we have 'current' used candles from this batch, but we also had leftover from before?\n        # Actually, we should consider that we might have leftover from previous cycles.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to use the used candles from the entire history to form new candles.\n\n Better way:\n\n   total_used = 0   # but we don't need to track separately, we can accumulate the burned ones and then form new ones.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   total = 0\n   candles = a\n   while candles > 0:\n        total += candles\n        # Now, after burning, we have 'candles' used candles, which we can use to form new ones.\n        # We can form new_candles = candles // b\n        # Then, we update: candles = new_candles + (candles % b)   [because we use up 'candles//b * b' used candles to form new ones, and the rest are leftovers]\n        # But wait: actually, the used candles are the total candles burned in the current step? Not exactly.\n\n Let me explain with example: ['4 2']\n\n Step 1: Start with 4 candles -> burn 4 hours. Now we have 4 used candles.\n   From 4 used candles, we can form 4//2 = 2 new candles, and we have 4%2=0 leftover.\n   So next we have 2 candles.\n\n Step 2: Burn 2 candles -> 2 hours. Now we have 2 used candles.\n   From 2 used candles, we can form 2//2 = 1 new candle, and 0 leftover.\n   Then next we have 1 candle.\n\n Step 3: Burn 1 candle -> 1 hour. Now we have 1 used candle.\n   Since 1 < 2, we stop.\n\n Total hours = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n But note: the above simulation uses the fact that the used candles from the previous steps are combined.\n\n However, we can simulate without separating the initial and leftovers by keeping track of the total candles available (which includes both initial and newly formed).\n\n Algorithm:\n\n   hours = 0\n   current = a   # current number of candles (both new and reformed)\n\n   while current > 0:\n        hours += current\n        # Now, we have 'current' used candles (from burning these current candles)\n        # But also, we have any leftover used candles from previous cycles? Actually, no: we are burning all current candles and then we use the total used candles (from this batch and previous leftovers) to form new ones.\n\n        However, wait: in the above simulation, we did not account for leftover from previous cycles. \n\n   Let me clarify: In the problem, we start with a candles. Then we burn them and get a used candles. Then we form floor(a/b) new candles and leave a % b used candles. Then we use those new candles (floor(a/b)) and add the leftover (a % b) to form the next batch.\n\n   But in the above example, we did:\n\n        Step 1: 4 candles -> 4 hours, then 4//2 = 2 new, and 4%2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles optimally. The key observation here is that each candle burns for one hour and then becomes a used candle. These used candles can be combined in groups of `b` to form new candles, which can then be burned again. The process continues until there are not enough used candles left to form a new candle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial number of candles, `a`.\n2. **Simulation Loop**: While there are candles available (either initial or newly formed from used candles):\n   - **Burn Candles**: Add the current number of candles to the total hours.\n   - **Update Used Candles**: After burning, the number of used candles is equal to the number of candles burned. These used candles can be converted into new candles. The number of new candles is calculated by integer division of the used candles by `b`, and the leftover used candles (if any) are carried forward.\n3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates when the number of candles (or usable used candles) drops below 1, meaning no more candles can be formed or burned.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and recycling candles until no more can be made, ensuring optimal usage.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a = int(data[0])\n    b = int(data[1])\n    \n    hours = 0\n    candles = a\n    \n    while candles > 0:\n        hours += candles\n        used = candles\n        new_candles = used // b\n        candles = new_candles + (used % b)\n        \n    print(hours)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial candles) and `b` (number of used candles needed to form a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: `hours` keeps track of the total burning time, starting at 0. `candles` starts with the initial number of candles, `a`.\n3. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are candles to burn:\n   - **Burning Phase**: The current number of candles (`candles`) is added to `hours` because each candle burns for one hour.\n   - **Recycling Phase**: The used candles (equal to `candles`) are processed. The number of new candles is calculated as `used // b`, and any remaining used candles (`used % b`) are carried over to the next iteration.\n4. **Output**: Once the loop exits, the total hours (`hours`) is printed, representing the maximum time the room can be lit.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the problem by continuously recycling used candles into new ones until it's no longer possible, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
