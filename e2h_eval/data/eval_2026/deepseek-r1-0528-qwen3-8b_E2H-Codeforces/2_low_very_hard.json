Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. All the letters on both diagonals must be the same (but note: the center is part of both diagonals, so we can consider the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, and that letter must be different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\", meaning that the entire main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) must have the same letter, and the entire anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must have the same letter. But note: the center is common to both diagonals. So the entire cross must be the same letter, say 'X', and the rest must be the same letter, say 'O' (or whatever, but different from 'X').\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n and the grid.\n 2. Check the two diagonals:\n    - main_diagonal: for i in range(n): grid[i][i]\n    - anti_diagonal: for i in range(n): grid[i][n-1-i]\n\n 3. Let d1 = the set of letters on the main diagonal. It must have only one unique letter? Actually, the condition is that all letters on the diagonal are the same. Similarly for anti-diagonal.\n\n 4. Now, check the rest of the grid (excluding the diagonals). All these letters must be the same, and that same letter must not be the same as the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the two diagonals might have different letters? The problem says: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n This does not necessarily mean the same letter for both diagonals? Actually, wait: the example input:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n\n   Output: NO\n\n Why? Because in the third row, the center is 's' (should be the same as the diagonals) but wait, the diagonals are:\n   Main diagonal: [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[2][2], grid[3][3], grid[4][4]] -> ['x','o','s','o','x'] -> not all same!\n   Anti-diagonal: [grid[0][4], grid[1][3], grid[2][2], grid[3][1], grid[4][0]] -> ['x','o','s','o','x'] -> not all same!\n\n But wait, the example input 3 is:\n\n   Input: \n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n   Output: YES\n\n For the 3x3 example:\n   Main diagonal: ['w','s','w'] -> not all same? But wait, the example output is YES.\n\n Let me read the problem again: \n   \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n In the 3x3 example, the main diagonal is ['w','s','w'] -> that's not the same letter. \n\n However, wait: the example input is:\n\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n But let's break down the 3x3 grid:\n\n   Row0: 'w','s','w'\n   Row1: 's','w','s'\n   Row2: 'w','s','w'\n\n The main diagonal: [ (0,0)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,2)='w'] -> all 'w'? \n   Actually, no: row0[0] = 'w', row1[1] = 'w' (because the second row is \"sws\", so the middle is 'w'), and row2[2] = 'w'. \n   So the main diagonal is all 'w'.\n\n The anti-diagonal: [ (0,2)='w', (1,1)='w', (2,0)='w'] -> all 'w'.\n\n Then the non-diagonal elements: \n   (0,1)='s', (0,2) is diagonal, (1,0)='s', (1,2)='s', (2,0) is diagonal, (2,1)='s'\n\n So non-diagonals: all 's'. And 's' is different from 'w'. So it satisfies.\n\n So the issue in the first example was that the main diagonal was not all the same.\n\n Therefore, steps:\n\n  Step 1: Read n and grid.\n\n  Step",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters in the grid must be the same different letter.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: The grid must have two diagonals (main and anti-diagonal) where all letters are the same. The main diagonal runs from the top-left to the bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal runs from the top-right to the bottom-left.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Letters**: All letters not on either diagonal must be the same and different from the letters on the diagonals.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the center element (common to both diagonals) is consistent with the diagonal letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag1_set = set()\n    diag2_set = set()\n    non_diag_letters = set()\n    diag_letter = None\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        j = i\n        k = n - 1 - i\n        if grid[i][j] != grid[i][k]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n        diag1_set.add(grid[i][j])\n        diag2_set.add(grid[i][k])\n        \n        if i != j and i != k:\n            non_diag_letters.add(grid[i][j])\n            non_diag_letters.add(grid[i][k])\n            \n    if len(diag1_set) != 1 or len(diag2_set) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if non_diag_letters:\n        if len(non_diag_letters) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n        common_non_diag = next(iter(non_diag_letters))\n        if common_non_diag == next(iter(diag1_set)):\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: For each cell on the main and anti-diagonals, it checks if all letters are the same. If any discrepancy is found, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Collects all letters not on the diagonals into a set. If there are multiple different letters or if these letters match the diagonal letters, it outputs \"NO\".\n4. **Result**: If all checks pass, it prints \"YES\", confirming the grid forms an \"X\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions by leveraging sets to check uniformity across diagonals and non-diagonal elements, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
