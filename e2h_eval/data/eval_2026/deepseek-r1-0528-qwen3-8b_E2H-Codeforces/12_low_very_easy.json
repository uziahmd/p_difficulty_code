The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (from 1 to n, then back to 1), we can consider the movement in two directions.\n\n However, note: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in increasing order of index (i.e., she must do task1, then task2, ... up to taskm).\n\n Important: The problem requires that for task i, she must be in house ai and have completed all tasks with numbers less than i.\n\n Observation:\n The ringroad is one-way clockwise. So, from house x, moving to house x+1 (mod n, but note: after n comes 1) is one step.\n But note: if we go from a higher number to a lower number, we cannot go backwards? Actually, the ring is circular and one-way (clockwise). \n However, note that because it's a ring, going from house 4 to house 3 is not allowed by the clockwise direction? Actually, the problem states that the ringroad is one-way and clockwise.\n\n But wait: the example input \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" leads to output 6. Let's break down:\n\n Example 1: \n   n=4, m=3, tasks = [3,2,3]\n\n   Start at house 1.\n   Then we must go to house 3 (first task): \n        Option 1: 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n        Option 2: 1->4->3 (2 steps) -> but wait, the ring is one-way clockwise. So from 1, we can only go to 2, then 3, then 4, then 1, etc.\n\n   Actually, the problem says: moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time. And the ringroad is one way (clockwise). Therefore, the only movement is from house i to house (i mod n) + 1? \n\n   However, note: the example sequence is: 1→2→3→4→1→2→3.\n\n   This means that they are allowed to traverse the entire ring and then continue from 1 again.\n\n   So, the movement is: \n     From house 1, you can go to 2, 3, 4, then 1, then 2, etc.\n\n   But note: the example does not use the direct backward path. It uses the clockwise path.\n\n   Therefore, the distance from house x to house y in a clockwise ring of n houses is:\n        If x <= y: then distance = y - x\n        If x > y: then distance = (n - x) + y   [because we go from x to n, then from n to 1, then to y? Actually, no: from x to n is (n-x) steps, then from n to 1 is 1 step? But wait, the ring has n houses, so from x to n: n-x steps, then from n to 1 is 0? Actually, we are at n, then next is 1 (which is adjacent). Then from 1 to y: y-1 steps? \n\n   Alternatively, we can think of the ring as circular. The clockwise distance from x to y is:\n        d = (y - x) % n   but if negative we adjust.\n\n   Actually, let me define:\n        If we are at house x and want to go to house y (with y>=x), then distance = y - x.\n        If y < x, then we can go from x to n, then wrap around: distance = (n - x) + y.\n\n   But wait, in the example: from 3 to 2 in a ring of 4: \n        Using the above: since 2<3, then distance = (4-3) + 2 = 1+2 = 3? But the example goes from 3 to 4 (1 step) then 4 to 1 (another step? but 4 to 1 is one step because the ring is connected) then 1 to 2 (another step) -> total 3 steps.\n\n   However, the example doesn't show a direct move from 3 to 2. In fact, the example does:\n\n        Start at 1, then goes to 3 (which is 2 steps: 1->2->3).\n        Then from 3 to 2: the example does 3->4->1->2 (3 steps).\n        Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 step).\n\n        Total steps: 2 (for first part) + 3 (for second) + 1 (for third) = 6.\n\n   But wait, the example says",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad. The ringroad is one-way and clockwise, meaning movement is only allowed in the increasing direction of house numbers, wrapping around from house `n` back to house `1`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house `1` and must visit a sequence of houses specified by her tasks. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she must complete tasks in the given order. The key observation is that moving from house `x` to house `y` in a clockwise direction can be broken down into two cases:\n   - If `y >= x`, the distance is simply `y - x`.\n   - If `y < x`, the distance is `(n - x) + y` because she moves from `x` to `n` and then wraps around to `y`.\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating through each task, calculating the distance from the current position to the next task's house, and accumulating the total time. The initial position is always house `1`. For each subsequent task, the distance is computed based on whether the target house is ahead or behind the current position in the clockwise direction.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, making it linear in time complexity, O(m), where `m` is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1\n    \n    for a in tasks:\n        if a >= current:\n            total_time += a - current\n        else:\n            total_time += (n - current + a)\n        current = a\n\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for `n` (number of houses), `m` (number of tasks), and the list of task locations.\n- **Initial Position**: Xenia starts at house `1`.\n- **Task Processing**: For each task location `a`:\n  - If `a` is greater than or equal to the current position, the distance is `a - current`.\n  - If `a` is less than the current position, the distance is `(n - current) + a` due to the circular nature of the ringroad.\n- **Update Position**: After processing each task, the current position is updated to the task's location.\n- **Output**: The accumulated total time is printed after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the circular movement properties of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
