    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Since the string is short, we can try to consider every substring and check for duplicates.\n However, note: We need the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. If the string length is less than 2, then no duplicate substring of length>=1? Actually, if the string is of length 1, then we cannot have two same substrings (unless we allow overlapping, but even with overlapping, two same single letters require two occurrences, which would be the same letter appearing at least twice). But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", meaning two non-overlapping? Actually, the sample test 2: 'ababa' -> output 3. In 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears starting at index0 and index2 (overlapping). So overlapping is allowed.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"at least twice\". So we can have two or more occurrences.\n\n Approach:\n We can iterate over possible lengths from the maximum possible (which is floor(n/2) because if we have two non-overlapping then the substring length must be <= n//2, but wait: the occurrences can overlap. Actually, the condition for overlapping is that the substring must appear at least two times, and the entire string is fixed.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the two occurrences to be non-overlapping. So we can have two overlapping ones.\n\n However, let's think: \n   Example: 'aaa' -> \n        substrings of length 1: 'a' appears 3 times -> valid, length=1.\n        substrings of length 2: 'aa' appears 2 times (starting at index0 and index1) -> valid, length=2.\n        substrings of length 3: 'aaa' appears only once -> invalid.\n\n So the answer for 'aaa' is 2.\n\n But note: the problem says \"longest substring that can be met at least twice\".\n\n We can do:\n   Let n = len(s)\n   We want to check for each possible length L (from 1 to n) if there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n However, we are looking for the maximum L for which this is true.\n\n But note: if a substring of length L appears twice, then we can also have a substring of length L-1 that appears multiple times (by taking parts of it) but we are interested in the longest.\n\n Since the string is short (<=100), we can do:\n\n   Let ans = 0\n   For L in range(n, 0, -1):   # start from the largest possible and go down until we find one\n        Create a dictionary to record the starting indices for each substring of length L.\n        For i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            If we have seen this substring before (i.e., we've encountered it at least once already) then we found a duplicate for this L.\n            But note: we don't want to count the same occurrence twice. So we can break early.\n\n        However, if we find at least one duplicate for a given L, then we set ans = L and break.\n\n   Then output ans.\n\n But wait: what if we have multiple L? We are going from large to small, so we break at the first (largest) L that has a duplicate.\n\n However, we must note: a substring of length L might be built from two different substrings of the same length. Also, we are storing all occurrences? Actually, we don't need to store all, we just need to know if we've seen it at least twice.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   Let ans = 0\n   For L in range(1, n+1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                # We have seen this substring before, so we have at least two occurrences (the one we are about to add and the one stored)\n                # But note: we are iterating and we haven't stored the current one. Actually, we are checking as we go.\n                # We can set a flag for this L and break out to record the maximum L later?\n                # However, we are going from small L to large, so we want the maximum L. So we should check from large to small.\n\n   So we change to:\n\n   Let ans = 0\n   for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n        found = False\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                # We've seen this substring at least",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which means we need to consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest substring that repeats at least once in the input string. Given the constraints (string length ≤ 100), a brute-force approach is feasible.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible substring length from the maximum possible down to 1, check if there exists any substring of that length that appears at least twice. The first such length found (starting from the largest) will be the answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate over possible substring lengths from the string length down to 1.\n   - For each length, use a dictionary to track substrings encountered.\n   - If a substring is encountered more than once, record the length and break early since we are checking from largest to smallest.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each possible substring length in descending order. For each length, it processes all substrings of that length, leading to a time complexity of O(n^3) in the worst case (n is the string length). However, given the constraint (n ≤ 100), this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    ans = 0\n    for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        duplicate_found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                duplicate_found = True\n                break\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n        if duplicate_found:\n            ans = L\n            break\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and its length is determined. If the string is empty, the result is immediately 0.\n2. **Iterate Over Lengths**: The algorithm checks substring lengths from the maximum possible (equal to the string length) down to 1.\n3. **Tracking Substrings**: For each length, a dictionary is used to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is found more than once, the loop breaks, and the current length is recorded as the answer.\n4. **Output Result**: The largest length for which a duplicate substring was found is printed. If no duplicates are found, the result remains 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination upon finding the largest valid length, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
