A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. They have k bottles -> total drink = k * l milliliters.\n For a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. But note: the toasts are for the entire group? Actually, the problem says:\n \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. But they want to make toasts such that each friend gets the same amount.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the total available drink in milliliters: total_drink = k * l\n 2. Calculate the total available lime slices: from c limes, each cut into d slices -> total_slices = c * d\n\n 3. Now, for one toast, we need:\n    - drink: nl milliliters (per friend per toast) but note: the entire group is making the same number of toasts per friend?\n    Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast.\n\n    But wait: if we are making T toasts per friend, then the total drink required is n * T * nl.\n    Similarly, for salt: total salt required is n * T * np.\n    And for lime: total slices required is n * T (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can think: \n    - The drink limits the total number of toasts (per friend) as: floor(total_drink / (n * nl))\n    - The lime limits: floor(total_slices / n)   [because each toast per friend requires one slice, and there are n friends so total slices needed is n * T]\n    - The salt limits: floor(p / (n * np))\n\n 5. However, note: the drink requirement is per friend per toast. So for T toasts per friend, we need:\n    - Drink: T * n * nl <= k * l  => T <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n    - Lime: T * n <= c * d        => T <= (c * d) / n\n    - Salt: T * n * np <= p       => T <= p / (n * np)\n\n 6. Therefore, the maximum T (toasts per friend) is the minimum of these three values, but we must take integer part (floor) because we can't have fractions of a toast.\n\n But note: the example input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n   n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n   total_drink = 4*5 = 20\n   total_slices = 10*8 = 80\n\n   Drink constraint: T <= 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> floor to 2\n   Lime constraint: T <= 80 / 3 ≈ 26.66 -> floor to 26\n   Salt constraint: T <= 100 / (3*1) ≈ 33.33 -> floor to 33\n\n   Then T = min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n 7. However, note: the example output is 2.\n\n 8. But wait, what if we consider the constraints independently? The example does not use the ceiling but floor.\n\n 9. Another sample: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n   n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n   total_drink = 1000\n   total_slices = 1*19 = 19\n\n   Drink: T <= 1000/(5*4) = 1000/20 = 50\n   Lime: T <= 19/5 = 3.8 -> floor to 3\n   Salt: T <= 90/(5*3)= 90/15 = 6\n\n   Then T = min(50, 3, 6) = 3.\n\n 10. Third sample: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n   n=1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the constraints imposed by the drink, lime slices, and salt, then find the minimum of these constraints to ensure all friends can partake equally in the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink per friend, one lime slice per friend, and a certain amount of salt per friend.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution hinges on determining how many toasts can be made without exceeding any of the available resources. The limiting factors are:\n   - **Drink**: Total available drink divided by the drink required per friend per toast.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total available lime slices divided by the number of friends (since each toast per friend requires one slice).\n   - **Salt**: Total available salt divided by the salt required per friend per toast.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each resource, compute the maximum number of toasts possible per friend. The smallest value among these three computations gives the answer, as it ensures no resource is exceeded.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves basic arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    total_slices = c * d\n    lime_toasts = total_slices // n\n    \n    salt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n    \n    ans = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast, respectively.\n2. **Calculating Total Resources**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Multiply the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n3. **Determining Toast Limits**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: Divide the total drink by the product of the number of friends and the drink per toast.\n   - **Lime Limit**: Divide the total lime slices by the number of friends.\n   - **Salt Limit**: Divide the total salt by the product of the number of friends and the salt per toast.\n4. **Finding the Minimum**: The answer is the smallest value among the three calculated limits, ensuring all resources are sufficient for the chosen number of toasts.\n5. **Output**: Print the result, which is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make.",
