    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an array `a` of n distinct integers (n <= 22). We have to output a permutation `b` of `a` such that for every non-empty proper subset S of indices (so excluding the full set and the empty set), the sum of elements in `b` at the positions in S is different.\n\n However, note: The condition must hold for all non-empty subsets S (with size between 1 and n-1). \n\n Observation:\n In the example: \n   Input: [1, 2] -> Output: [2, 1]\n   Input: [1000, 100, 10, 1] -> Output: [100, 1, 1000, 10]\n\n Why is [2,1] valid?\n   Consider the two possible non-empty proper subsets: \n     S1 = {0}: then sum of b at index0 is 2, and at index1 is 1.\n     S2 = {1}: then sum of b at index1 is 1, and at index0 is 2.\n     But wait, we also have to consider the subset with two indices? Actually, note: the problem says \"for every non-empty subset S (with 0 < k < n)\". Since n=2, k can only be 1. So we require the two single-element subsets to have different sums. And indeed 2 != 1.\n\n However, what if we consider the entire set? The problem does not require the entire set to be excluded from the condition? Actually, note: the condition excludes the full set (k < n) so k cannot be n. So for n=2, we don't care about the entire set (which would be the whole array). But wait, note: the problem says \"non-empty subset\" and \"0 < k < n\", so for n=2, k can be 1 only.\n\n But for n=3, we have to consider all subsets of size 1 and 2.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Let T be the total sum of the array. Then note: if we consider a subset S, its complement S' has sum T - (sum of S). However, the condition doesn't directly relate S and S'. But note: the problem requires that the sum for S is different from the sum for any other non-empty proper subset.\n\n One idea: the minimal requirement is that all the subset-sums (for subsets of size from 1 to n-1) must be distinct.\n\n However, note: the number of subsets is 2^n - 2 (excluding empty and full). For n up to 22, that's 2^22 - 2 which is about 4 million subsets. But the numbers can be as large as 10^9, and the total sum might be very large.\n\n But note: the array has distinct integers, but the problem does not restrict the permutation. We are allowed to arrange arbitrarily.\n\n However, the condition is very strong: we need 2^n - 2 distinct subset sums (each being the sum of the elements at the chosen indices). The maximum distinct subset sums we can have is limited by the range of subset sums. But note: we are only considering subsets of size from 1 to n-1.\n\n But observe: the minimal distinct subset sums we can have is (2^n - 2) and the minimal distinct subset sums we can form from the array (if we arrange arbitrarily) must be at least (2^n - 2) distinct values.\n\n However, there is a known fact: if we use the powers of two (like in the standard Gray code or linear basis) we can get distinct subset sums. But note: the standard distinct subset sums for a set of n numbers is achieved when the numbers are powers of two (then each subset sum is unique). However, here we are allowed to permute arbitrarily, but we are forced to use the given distinct integers.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the subset sums to be consecutive or anything, just distinct.\n\n However, the problem does not require the entire set of subset sums (from all subsets) to be distinct, only the ones from non-empty proper subsets. But note: the entire set of subsets (including the full set) would then be distinct too? Not necessarily, but we don't care about the full set.\n\n But wait: what if two different subsets (one of size k and one of size n-k) happen to have the same sum? Then we break the condition.\n\n So we require that for any two distinct subsets S and T (both non-empty and not the entire set), the sum of the elements in b at the positions in S is not equal to the sum of the elements in b at the positions in T.\n\n Now, note: the entire set is excluded, so we don't require the entire set to be distinct from any other subset? Actually, no: because the entire set is excluded, so even if the entire set's sum equals the sum of a proper subset, that's allowed? But wait: the condition is for non-empty subsets with size between 1 and n-1. The entire set is not considered. So if we have two different subsets (both not the entire set) that have the same sum, that's bad.\n\n However, note: the entire set is not included in the condition, but the complement of a subset S (which is the entire set minus S) is a subset that we do consider (unless S is the entire set, which we don't consider). So if S is a proper subset, then its complement is also a proper subset (if n>=2, then complement of a proper non-empty subset is also proper and non-empty unless n=1, but n>=1 and if n=1 then there are no non-empty proper subsets, so condition holds trivially). \n\n But note: for n=1, there are no non-empty proper subsets (because k must be between 1 and n-1, so 1<=k<=0, which is impossible). So for n=1, we don't need to satisfy any condition. Then we can output the array itself.\n\n However, the problem states: \"non-empty subset S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 0 < k <n)\". For n=1: 0<k<1 -> no such k exists. So condition holds.\n\n But note: the input n can be 1.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If n==1: output the array and return.\n\n 2. We need to assign the given distinct integers to positions 0 to n-1.\n\n How to ensure that all subset sums (for non-empty proper subsets) are distinct?\n\n Note: The entire set is excluded, but we still have to worry about two different proper subsets having the same sum.\n\n Known: if we can arrange the array so that the entire set of subset sums (for all subsets) are distinct, then we are safe. But the problem does not require the entire set (the full set) to be distinct from others? Actually, the condition does not require the full set to be distinct from any proper subset. However, note: if we have two different subsets (say S and T) that are both proper and have the same sum, that breaks the condition.\n\n But also note: the entire set is excluded, but if we have two different proper subsets (S and T) such that S ∪ T = entire set and they are disjoint, then we require the sums to be distinct. \n\n There is a known result: the maximum number of distinct subset sums for a set of n distinct positive integers is 2^n, and the minimal distinct subset sums we require is 2^n - 1 (excluding the empty set). But here we exclude the full set as well? Actually, we require 2^n - 2 distinct subset sums (excluding empty and full). However, note: the problem does not require the entire set to be distinct from any proper subset. But the entire set's sum is fixed and we don't check it against the condition. However, the condition requires that the proper subsets (each non-empty and not the entire set) have distinct sums. So we require at least (2^n - 2) distinct subset sums.\n\n But note: the entire set is not required to be distinct from the proper subsets. However, if the entire set's sum equals the sum of a proper subset, then that proper subset is already taken by the entire set? Actually, the condition does not require that the proper subsets have distinct sums from the entire set. So the entire set's sum can be the same as a proper subset's sum without violating the condition? Let me read: \"for every non-empty subset S ... the sums ... are different\". This means that we consider only the non-empty proper subsets. The entire set is not considered. Therefore, two different proper subsets must have distinct sums, but the entire set's sum may or may not be distinct from the proper subsets. \n\n However, wait: what if we have two different proper subsets that have the same sum? That breaks the condition. And what if the entire set's sum equals the sum of a proper subset? Then we have two different subsets (the proper one and the entire set) that have the same sum. But the entire set is not included in the condition. However, note: the condition says \"for every non-empty subset S (with 0 < k < n)\" the sums are different. It does not say that the entire set must be different from the proper subsets. So having the entire set's sum equal to a proper subset's sum is allowed? \n\n But let me think: the condition must hold for all pairs of non-empty proper subsets. The entire set is not included, so the proper subsets must have distinct sums among themselves, but the entire set can have a sum that is already present in a proper subset? \n\n Example: n=3, and the array is [1,2,3]. \n   Entire set sum = 6.\n   Proper subsets: \n      {0}: 1, {1}:2, {2}:3, {0,1}:3, {0,2}:4, {1,2}:5.\n\n Now, we have two subsets (the singleton {2} and the pair {0,1}) both have sum 3. So this arrangement fails.\n\n But note: we are allowed to permute arbitrarily. So we can choose a permutation that avoids this.\n\n However, the problem does not require that the entire set's sum is distinct from the proper subsets. But in the above example, the entire set's sum (6) is not in the list of proper subsets (which are [1,2,3,3,4,5]), but the duplicate 3 breaks the condition.\n\n So we require that all the subset sums for the proper subsets (i.e., all subsets except the full set) are distinct.\n\n Therefore, we require that the multiset of subset sums (excluding the empty set and the full set) has no duplicates.\n\n How can we achieve that?\n\n One way is to try to assign the numbers in such a way that the subset sums are as spread out as possible.\n\n Another idea: use the fact that the numbers are distinct and positive (since they are distinct and nonnegative, but note: the input can have zeros? The problem says \"0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9\", so zeros are allowed.\n\n However, zeros complicate the matter because then we can have multiple subsets with the same sum (by including zeros arbitrarily). So we have to avoid zeros? Or handle zeros appropriately.\n\n But note: the problem says distinct integers, so zeros can appear at most once.\n\n Let's consider the necessary conditions:\n\n 1. The set must have distinct subset sums for all subsets (except the empty and full) to be distinct.\n\n 2. The number of distinct subset sums we require is (2^n - 2). The maximum subset sum we can have is the total sum, and the minimum is the minimum element (if positive, then at least the smallest element). The range of subset sums must be at least (2^n - 2) distinct numbers.\n\n However, the minimal distinct subset sums we can form from a set of n distinct positive integers is 2^n (if we use powers of two) and that gives distinct subset sums for all subsets. Then certainly the proper subsets (which are a subset of all subsets) will have distinct sums.\n\n So if we can assign the given numbers (if they are powers of two) then we are done. But the input numbers are arbitrary distinct integers.\n\n But note: we are allowed to permute arbitrarily. So we are free to assign the numbers to the positions arbitrarily. The condition on the subset sums depends on the assignment? Actually, the set of numbers is fixed, but the assignment to positions does not change the set of numbers. However, the subset sum condition is over the entire set of numbers, regardless of their position? \n\n Wait: no. The condition is: the sum of the elements at the chosen indices. So if we assign the numbers to different positions, then the subset sum for a given set of indices is the sum of the numbers assigned to those indices.\n\n So the set of numbers is fixed. We are just assigning them to positions. The condition is that the multiset of subset sums (for non-empty proper subsets) must be distinct.\n\n However, note: the set of numbers is fixed. The subset sums are determined by the set, not by the assignment. Therefore, the condition is independent of the permutation? \n\n But wait: the condition is defined by the positions. However, the problem says: Construct an array b by permuting a. Then the condition is on the array b.\n\n However, the condition is: for every non-empty subset S of indices, the sum of the elements in b at positions S must be distinct.\n\n But note: the indices are fixed (from 0 to n-1). The assignment is a permutation of the original array.\n\n So the set of numbers is fixed, but the assignment to the indices matters. \n\n Example: n=2, array [1,2]. \n   Option1: [1,2] -> \n        Subsets: {0}:1, {1}:2, {0,1}:3 (excluded). Then the two proper subsets have distinct sums (1 and 2). So [1,2] works? \n        But the example output is [2,1]. \n\n   Let me check [1,2]:\n        Subset {0}: 1\n        Subset {1}: 2\n        These are distinct. So [1,2] should be acceptable.\n\n   However, the example output was [2,1]. \n\n   But wait: the example input was \"2\\n1 2\", and the example output was \"2 1\".\n\n   Why did they output [2,1]? \n\n   Actually, the condition does not require the entire set to be distinct from the proper subsets, but note: the example output [2,1] is also acceptable. \n\n   But the problem says: \"If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\"\n\n   So both [1,2] and [2,1] are acceptable.\n\n   However, let me check [1,2] for n=2: \n        Condition: non-empty proper subsets (only singletons) must have distinct sums. \n        Sum of first element: 1, second element: 2 -> distinct. So [1,2] is acceptable.\n\n   But why the example output is [2,1]? Maybe they chose the lexicographically larger one? Or perhaps there was an error.\n\n   However, note: the example input has two test cases? Actually, the example input is given as:\n\n        ['2\\n1 2', '4\\n1000 100 10 1']\n\n   and the output is:\n\n        ['2 1', '100 1 1000 10']\n\n   So the first case outputs [2,1] and the second [100,1,1000,10].\n\n   Why did they not output [1,2] for the first case?\n\n   There might be more to the problem: the problem statement says \"Note that b must be a permutation of a\". So both are permutations.\n\n   But wait: what if the problem intended to require that the entire set of subset sums (including the full set) are distinct? Then [1,2] would fail because the entire set (full set) is excluded, but note the condition does not include the full set. \n\n   However, let me check the example [1,2] again: the full set is {0,1} which is excluded. The condition is only for the two singletons. They are distinct.\n\n   But wait: the example input \"4\\n1000 100 10 1\" and output \"100 1 1000 10\" must satisfy the condition.\n\n   Let me check the second example: [100, 1, 1000, 10] for n=4.\n\n   We must check that for every non-empty proper subset (so subsets of size 1,2,3) the sums are distinct.\n\n   The total set of numbers: {100, 1, 1000, 10}. The set of subset sums (for all subsets) would be huge, but we only care about the proper ones (so excluding the full set which is 100+1+1000+10=1111).\n\n   But note: the example output is [100, 1, 1000, 10]. \n\n   However, there is a catch: the example output has two ones? Actually, the input is [1000, 100, 10, 1] and the output is [100, 1, 1000, 10]. The set is the same.\n\n   But wait: the problem says distinct integers. The input has distinct integers. The output is a permutation, so distinct.\n\n   However, the example output uses the numbers 100, 1, 1000, 10. These are distinct.\n\n   Why did they choose that particular permutation?\n\n   After thinking, note: the problem does not require the entire set of subset sums to be distinct (including the full set). But we require the proper subsets (non-empty and not full) to have distinct sums.\n\n   How to solve the problem?\n\n   Approach:\n\n   Since n is at most 22, the total number of subsets is 2^22 which is about 4e6, which is acceptable to iterate if we can generate the subset sums and check for duplicates. However, we are to output a permutation that satisfies the condition.\n\n   But note: the set of numbers is fixed. The subset sums are determined by the set, not the order. So if we can show that the set of numbers has the property that all the subset sums (for non-empty proper subsets) are distinct, then any permutation would work. Otherwise, we must find an ordering that ensures that the subset sums (for the proper subsets) are distinct.\n\n   However, wait: the subset sums depend on the set, not the ordering. The set of numbers is fixed. Therefore, the multiset of subset sums is fixed. So if there are two different subsets (of the set) that have the same sum, then no matter how we assign the numbers to the array, the condition will fail because the two subsets (as sets of indices) will have the same sum.\n\n   Therefore, the problem reduces to: \n\n      Given a set S of n distinct integers, does there exist an ordering (permutation) of S such that the following holds? \n          Actually, no: the condition is independent of the ordering because the subset sums are defined by the set. \n\n   Wait, I think I made a mistake: the condition is defined by the indices. The array b is a permutation of a. The subset sum for a set of indices S is the sum of the elements in b at those indices. But note: the set of indices S is fixed (we are considering the array of n elements). However, the assignment of the numbers to indices changes the meaning of S. \n\n   Example: two different assignments (permutations) of the same set S to the indices, then the subset sum for a fixed set S (say the first two indices) would be the sum of the two numbers assigned to the first two positions. \n\n   But note: the set of numbers is fixed. The condition must hold for every non-empty proper subset of indices. \n\n   However, the set of subset sums we get from the array b is the set { sum_{i in T} b[i] for T being a non-empty proper subset of {0,...,n-1} }.\n\n   Since b is a permutation of a, the multiset of numbers is the same as a. Therefore, the set of subset sums we can form is exactly the set of subset sums of the multiset a (but note: we are forming subsets by indices, and the array b contains the same multiset). \n\n   However, the condition is that these subset sums (for non-empty proper subsets) are distinct. \n\n   But note: the subset sums we form are the same as the subset sums of the multiset a, because the assignment to indices is just labeling. \n\n   Example: n=2, a = [1,2]. The set of subset sums for non-empty proper subsets is {1,2}. \n\n   Now, if we assign differently, say [2,1], then the subset sums are: \n        index0: 2, index1: 1, and the full set is 3 (excluded). \n        So the set is still {1,2}. \n\n   Therefore, the condition is independent of the permutation. It only depends on the set. \n\n   But wait: that cannot be. Because the problem says \"construct an array b by permuting a\", and then the condition is defined by the array b. \n\n   However, the set of numbers is the same, so the multiset of subset sums (for all subsets) is the same. \n\n   But note: the condition is only for non-empty proper subsets. And the set of subset sums (for the entire set of subsets) is fixed. \n\n   Therefore, if the set a has two different subsets (of the set a) that have the same sum, then no matter how we assign the numbers to the array, the condition will fail because the two subsets (as sets of indices) will correspond to two different ways of selecting the same two numbers (or the same multiset of numbers) and hence the same sum.\n\n   However, wait: the condition is defined by the indices. But the set of numbers is fixed, so the multiset of subset sums is fixed. \n\n   Therefore, the existence of a solution is independent of the permutation. \n\n   Then why the example outputs a different permutation? \n\n   Actually, the example input [1,2] has two permutations: [1,2] and [2,1]. Both yield the same set of subset sums (for the proper subsets). \n\n   But note: the problem does not require the entire set of subset sums to be distinct (including the full set). It only requires the proper subsets to be distinct. \n\n   However, the set of subset sums (for the entire set of subsets) is fixed. Therefore, if the set a has two different subsets (by content) that have the same sum, then the condition fails for any permutation. \n\n   But wait: the condition is defined by the indices. The set of numbers is fixed. The condition is: for every non-empty subset S of indices, the sum of the elements in b at the indices in S must be distinct.\n\n   However, note: the same set of numbers, but arranged in different orders, does not change the multiset of subset sums. \n\n   Therefore, the problem is: given a set of n distinct integers, is the set of subset sums (for all non-empty proper subsets) distinct?\n\n   And if yes, then output any permutation (for example, the sorted one) and if no, then output -1.\n\n   But wait: the example input [1,2] is yes. \n\n   What about the example input [1000, 100, 10, 1]? \n\n   Let me check if the set {1000,100,10,1} has distinct subset sums for all non-empty proper subsets.\n\n   The entire set: 1000+100+10+1 = 1111 (excluded).\n\n   The proper subsets: all subsets of size 1,2,3.\n\n   We need to check that all the subset sums (for subsets of sizes 1,2,3) are distinct.\n\n   The subset sums for size1: {1,10,100,1000}\n\n   For size2: \n        1+10=11, 1+100=101, 1+1000=1001, 10+100=110, 10+1000=1010, 100+1000=1100\n\n   For size3:\n        1+10+100=111, 1+10+1000=1011, 1+100+1000=1101, 10+100+1000=1110\n\n   Now, check duplicates:\n\n        Size1: 1,10,100,1000 -> distinct.\n        Size2: 11,101,1001,110,1010,1100 -> distinct.\n        Size3: 111,1011,1101,1110 -> distinct.\n\n   Also, check across sizes:\n\n        Compare size1 and size2: \n            1,10,100,1000 vs 11,101,1001,110,1010,1100 -> no overlaps.\n        Compare size1 and size3: \n            1,10,100,1000 vs 111,1011,1101,1110 -> no overlaps.\n        Compare size2 and size3:\n            11,101,1001,110,1010,1100 vs 111,1011,1101,1110 -> \n            101 and 1011: different, 1001 and 1011: different, etc. -> no overlaps.\n\n   So the set {1000,100,10,1} has distinct subset sums for all non-empty proper subsets.\n\n   Therefore, the condition holds.\n\n   But wait, what about the example output? The example output is [100, 1, 1000, 10]. \n\n   Why didn't they output the sorted array? \n\n   The problem says: \"If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\" So we can output any permutation.\n\n   However, the example input [1,2] could output [1,2] or [2,1]. The example chose [2,1].\n\n   But note: the example input [1,2] is small. \n\n   However, the problem does not specify a particular permutation. \n\n   But wait: there's a catch. \n\n   The above reasoning shows that the condition is independent of the permutation. Therefore, we can output any permutation of the array if the set of numbers has distinct subset sums for all non-empty proper subsets. \n\n   But what if the set does not have distinct subset sums? \n\n   Example: n=3, set {1,2,3}. \n        Subset sums (proper subsets):\n          size1: {1,2,3}\n          size2: {1+2=3, 1+3=4, 2+3=5}\n\n        Now, we see that the subset {3} (size1) and {1,2} (size2) both have sum 3. So duplicate.\n\n        Therefore, the set {1,2,3} does not work.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n        Step1: Read n and the list a.\n\n        Step2: If n == 1, output the array and return.\n\n        Step3: Check if the set a has distinct subset sums for all non-empty proper subsets.\n\n        However, generating all subset sums for a set of up to 22 elements is 2^22 (about 4e6) which is acceptable in Python if done carefully.\n\n        But note: we are only interested in the proper subsets (so excluding the full set). The total number of subsets is 2^n, so we can generate all subset sums and then remove the empty set and the full set and check for duplicates.\n\n        However, note: the empty set is not included, and the full set is excluded. But we must consider: the condition is for non-empty proper subsets. \n\n        How to generate subset sums for a set of n numbers? \n\n        We can use bit masks. But note: the numbers can be as large as 10^9, and the total sum can be up to 22*10^9 = 220e9, which is within the range of Python integers.\n\n        Steps for checking:\n\n            total_subsets = 1 << n\n            max_sum = sum(a)\n\n            We'll create a set (or a dictionary) to record the subset sums we've seen.\n\n            But note: we must avoid the empty set and the full set.\n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate over all masks from 1 to (total_subsets-1) and skip the mask that represents the full set (mask = total_subsets-1).\n\n            However, the full set is mask (1<<n) - 1. \n\n            But note: the condition excludes the full set. We are to consider all subsets except the full set and the empty set.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                seen = set()\n                for mask in range(1, 1<<n):   # from 1 to (2^n - 1)\n                    s = 0\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        if mask & (1 << i):\n                            s += a[i]\n                    if s == max_sum: \n                        continue   # skip the full set? But wait: the full set is represented by mask (1<<n)-1, and we are iterating by mask from 1 to (1<<n)-1. But note: the full set is one particular mask. However, we don't know if the set has duplicate representation? No, because the set is fixed and the mask is fixed.\n\n                    Actually, we must skip the full set. But note: the set a is distinct, so the full set is unique.\n\n                    However, we don't know if the full set is the only one with that sum. But we are going to skip the mask that is the full set.\n\n                But wait: the condition requires to skip the full set. So we can do:\n\n                    total_mask = (1<<n) - 1\n                    for mask in range(1, 1<<n):\n                        if mask == total_mask:\n                            continue\n                        s = 0\n                        for i in range(n):\n                            if mask & (1 << i):\n                                s += a[i]\n                        # Then check if s is already in the set.\n\n            However, the above loop would be O(2^n * n) which is acceptable for n=22? 2^22 is about 4e6, and 4e6*22 ~ 88e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline in speed.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming (DP) for subset-sums, but then we have to account for the fact that we want to count distinct sums and also avoid the full set.\n\n            But note: the problem is that we don't care about the count, we care about duplicates. We can use a set.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                dp = {0}   # start with the empty set\n                for num in a:\n                    new_dp = set(dp)   # copy\n                    for x in dp:\n                        new_dp.add(x + num)\n                    dp = new_dp\n\n                Then the total set of subset sums is dp.\n\n                Then we remove the full set (which is the sum of all) and the empty set (0). But note: the condition excludes the empty set and the full set. \n\n                However, the empty set is 0 and the full set is the total sum.\n\n                Then we check if the size of (dp without {0, total_sum}) is (2^n - 2).\n\n                But wait: the set dp includes the empty set and the full set. The number of distinct subset sums (for all subsets) is the size of dp. \n\n                Then the condition requires that the set (dp without {0, total_sum}) has (2^n - 2) distinct elements. But note: the set dp might have less than 2^n distinct subset sums because of duplicates. \n\n                Actually, the condition is that the proper subsets (non-empty and not full) have distinct sums. \n\n                So we must check that the set (dp without {0, total_sum}) has (2^n - 2) elements.\n\n                However, wait: the set dp has 2^n elements (if no duplicates) but we are removing two, so we expect 2^n - 2 distinct sums.\n\n                But if there are duplicates, then the set dp has fewer than 2^n elements.\n\n                Therefore, we can check: \n\n                    if len(dp) - (1 if total_sum in dp else 0) - (1 if 0 in dp else 0) == (1<<n) - 2:\n                        then the condition holds? \n\n                Actually, no: we removed two specific elements (0 and total_sum). But note: the set dp includes 0 and total_sum. \n\n                The condition requires that the non-empty proper subsets (which are all subsets except the empty set and the full set) have distinct sums. \n\n                Therefore, the set (dp without {0, total_sum}) must have (2^n - 2) elements. But if there are duplicates in the subset sums (for the entire set of subsets) then the set dp has less than 2^n elements, and after removing two we get less than 2^n-2, so the condition fails.\n\n                Alternatively, we can simply check:\n\n                    s = set()\n                    for mask in range(1<<n):\n                        # compute the subset sum for the mask\n                        # but we can use the dp set we built above.\n\n                    Actually, the dp set we built above is the set of all subset sums. Then the condition is: \n\n                    total_proper = (1<<n) - 2\n                    if len(dp) - (1 if 0 in dp else 0) - (1 if total_sum in dp else 0) == total_proper:\n                        then condition holds.\n\n                But note: the set dp includes 0 and total_sum. The number of distinct subset sums for the entire set is the size of dp. Then the proper subsets (without the empty set and the full set) would be the set dp without {0, total_sum}. \n\n                However, if there is a duplicate in the entire set of subsets, then the set dp has less than 2^n elements, and then removing two might leave duplicates? \n\n                Actually, no: the condition for the proper subsets is that they are distinct. The entire set of subset sums (including duplicates) is dp. Then the set of distinct subset sums (for the entire set) is dp. \n\n                Then the set of distinct subset sums for the proper subsets is dp without {0, total_sum}. \n\n                And the condition requires that the proper subsets have distinct sums. So the set dp without {0, total_sum} must have exactly (2^n - 2) elements.\n\n                Therefore, we can check:\n\n                    if len(dp) == (1<<n):   # no duplicates at all (including the full set and empty set)\n                        then the condition holds because we remove two distinct elements (0 and total_sum) and the remaining set has 2^n-2 distinct elements.\n\n                    But if there are duplicates, then the set dp has less than 2^n, and then the set dp without {0,total_sum} has less than 2^n-2, so the condition fails.\n\n                However, wait: what if the duplicate occurs in the full set? Actually, the full set is one element. Similarly, the empty set is one.\n\n                But note: the condition requires distinct subset sums for the proper subsets. The proper subsets are the entire set of subsets without the empty and the full. \n\n                The condition fails if there is any duplicate in the entire set of subset sums (for the entire set of subsets) because then the duplicate might occur in two different subsets that are both proper (if the duplicate is not the empty set or the full set) or one of them might be the empty set or full set.\n\n                However, if a duplicate occurs between two different subsets, and one of them is the empty set and the other is a proper subset, then the proper subset would have the same sum as the empty set? But the empty set is 0, so if a proper subset has sum 0, then that duplicate exists. Similarly, if the full set's sum appears in a proper subset, then we have a duplicate.\n\n                But note: the condition does not require the full set to be distinct from the proper subsets. However, the proper subsets must be distinct. \n\n                Actually, the condition requires that the proper subsets (non-empty and not full) have distinct sums. The full set is excluded, but if the full set's sum appears in a proper subset, that does not break the condition for the proper subsets because the condition does not compare the full set. However, the condition requires that the proper subsets are distinct. \n\n                But wait: if two different proper subsets have the same sum, then we break the condition. And if a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if we can permute the given array such that all non-empty proper subsets of its indices have distinct sums. If such a permutation exists, we output it; otherwise, we return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the condition requires all subset sums (for subsets of size between 1 and n-1) to be distinct. This means no two different subsets (of the specified size) should have the same sum. The solution involves checking if the given set of numbers can form distinct subset sums for all non-empty proper subsets.\n2. **Insight**: The subset sums are determined by the elements of the array, not their positions. Therefore, the existence of a valid permutation depends on whether the multiset of subset sums (excluding the empty set and the full set) has exactly \\(2^n - 2\\) distinct values. If duplicates exist in these subset sums, no permutation will satisfy the condition.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use bitmasking to generate all possible subset sums. For each bitmask from 1 to \\(2^n - 1\\), we compute the sum of the corresponding elements. We then check if the count of distinct subset sums (excluding the full set sum) matches \\(2^n - 2\\).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves generating all subset sums, which requires \\(O(n \\cdot 2^n)\\) operations. Given the constraint \\(n \\leq 22\\), this approach is feasible as \\(2^{22}\\) is approximately 4 million operations, manageable within time limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n        \n    total_sum = sum(a)\n    dp_set = set()\n    dp_set.add(0)\n    \n    for num in a:\n        new_set = set(dp_set)\n        for x in dp_set:\n            new_set.add(x + num)\n        dp_set = new_set\n        \n    if len(dp_set) != (1 << n):\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    if (total_sum in dp_set) and (0 in dp_set):\n        if len(dp_set) - 2 == (1 << n) - 2:\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, a)))\n            return\n        else:\n            print(-1)\n            return\n            \n    else:\n        missing = (1 << n) - 2 - len(dp_set) + (1 if total_sum in dp_set else 0) + (1 if 0 in dp_set else 0)\n        if missing == 0:\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, a)))\n        else:\n            print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the array size and the array elements.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the array size is 1, the only valid permutation is the array itself, so it is printed directly.\n3. **Subset Sum Calculation**: Using dynamic programming, we generate all possible subset sums. A set is used to store these sums to automatically handle duplicates.\n4. **Validation Check**: After computing all subset sums, we check if the number of distinct sums matches \\(2^n - 2\\) (accounting for the exclusion of the empty set and the full set). If they match, any permutation of the array (the original array is used here for simplicity) is printed; otherwise, -1 is printed indicating no valid permutation exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the feasibility of the solution by leveraging bitmasking and set properties to ensure all subset sums are distinct, providing an optimal solution within the problem constraints.",
