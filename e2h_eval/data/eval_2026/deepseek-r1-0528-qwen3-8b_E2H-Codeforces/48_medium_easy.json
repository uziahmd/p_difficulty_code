He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length up to 1000). However, note that if b is 'R', then the number is guaranteed to be at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given string `c` from base `a` to base 10 (integer).\n    - Since the string might have leading zeros, we just need to interpret each digit. But note: the digits in base a (if a<=25) might include digits from '0' to '9' and then letters from 'A' to ...? Actually, note the example: base 12 uses 'A' for 10, base 13 uses 'A' for 10, etc.\n    - The problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" So we have to map the string to digits.\n\n    How to convert string `c` (which is in base `a`) to an integer?\n      Let n = len(c)\n      value = 0\n      for each character in c:\n          d = convert_char(char)   # which gives a digit value from 0 to a-1\n          value = value * a + d\n\n    But note: the input string can have leading zeros. The conversion should ignore leading zeros? Actually, no, because the conversion formula naturally handles leading zeros if we process from left to right. However, if the entire string is zeros then the value is 0. But the problem says the number is non-negative and may contain leading zeros.\n\n 2. Then, we have two cases for b:\n\n    Case 1: b is an integer (between 2 and 25)\n        We need to convert the base-10 integer to base b.\n\n        Steps:\n          If the number is 0, output \"0\"\n          Otherwise, repeatedly divide the number by b and record the remainders (as digits). Then reverse the remainders.\n\n        How to represent digits in base b?\n          Base b digits go from 0 to b-1.\n          For digits 0 to 9: use the character '0' to '9'\n          For digits 10 and above: use uppercase letters starting from 'A' (so 10 -> 'A', 11->'B', ...)\n\n        However, note: if the base is 1, but the problem states base from 2 to 25, so no need to worry about base 1.\n\n    Case 2: b is 'R'\n        Then we need to convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral.\n\n        Constraints: the number is at least 1 and at most 300010.\n\n        We need to write a function to convert an integer to Roman numerals.\n\n        According to the problem, the subtractive principle is used for 4 and 9, and also for 40, 90, 400, 900.\n\n        Standard Roman numerals use the following symbols and their values:\n          I = 1\n          V = 5\n          X = 10\n          L = 50\n          C = 100\n          D = 500\n          M = 1000\n\n        However, note the problem says the number can be up to 300010. The standard Roman numerals do not typically represent numbers beyond 3999 without using bars or other notations. But the problem says \"the number would be less than or equal to 300010\", so we must handle up to 300010.\n\n        But wait, 300010 is 300,010. The standard system doesn't have a symbol for 100000 or above. However, the problem does not specify an extended system. Let me re-read: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed\". \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" but that was for the base representation, not for Roman. \n\n        The problem says the number is at most 300010. We can use the standard method for Roman numerals by breaking the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n        However, note: 300010 is 300,010. How do we represent that?\n\n        Standard Roman numerals don't have a symbol for 100000 or 500000. But the problem says we can use the same subtractive principle and the same symbols (I, V, X, L, C, D, M). \n\n        Let me check the example: they only provided examples up to 5 and 4. Also the example input \"16 R\\n5\" -> 'V', and \"5 R\\n4\" -> 'IV'. \n\n        Since the problem says \"the number would be less than or equal to 300010\", we must handle numbers as large as 300010.\n\n        But wait, 300010 is 300,010. How to represent 300,000? \n\n        We can break it down:\n\n        We can define the Roman numeral conversion for numbers up to 3999 (as usual) and then for higher numbers? Actually, the problem says the number is at most 300010, which is 300010.\n\n        However, looking at the problem statement, the example inputs are small. But note the constraint: the number in base a (if not Roman) can be very large (up to 10^10^10? Actually, the note says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\" meaning 10^1510? That is too big. But wait, the problem says:\n\n        \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n        So if b is not 'R', then the base-10 integer is at most 10^1510? Actually, wait: the input string has at most 1000 digits, and base a is at most 25. The maximum value of c in base a is (a^1000 - 1) which is huge, but the problem says that if we are not converting to Roman, the number (in base 10) is not greater than 10^1510? Actually, the note says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\" -> This means the base-10 number is <= 10^1510? Or is it a typo? \n\n        Let me read again: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\" -> 101510 is one hundred thousand five hundred ten. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the number in base a with 1000 digits can be astronomically large.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n        Wait, there might be a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"the number won't be greater than 101510\" in any other case? But 101510 is a fixed number. \n\n        Let me clarify: the input string c is given in base a. The problem says the number (in base 10) is at most 300010 if we are going to Roman, and in any other case (i.e., when b is an integer) the number is at most 101510? \n\n        However, note that the input string c has up to 1000 digits and base a up to 25. The maximum value is (a^1000 - 1) which is way bigger than 101510. \n\n        This suggests that the guarantee is on the base-10 integer value, but for non-Roman cases, the base-10 integer is bounded by 101510. \n\n        So if b is an integer, then after converting the string c (from base a) to base 10, the integer will be <= 101510.\n\n        Therefore, we can safely convert the string c from base a to base 10, and then:\n\n          - If b is an integer, convert the base-10 integer (which is <= 101510) to base b (without worrying about huge numbers).\n          - If b is 'R', then we have an integer between 1 and 300010.\n\n        But wait: what if a is 2 and the string c is 1000...0 (1000 digits)? Then the base-10 integer is 2^999, which is huge, but according to the problem, if b is an integer then the base-10 integer must be <= 101510. So we don't have to worry about huge numbers in the non-Roman case because the input guarantees that the base-10 number is <= 101510 when b is an integer.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Convert string c from base a to an integer (base10_num)\n\n          Step 2: \n            If b is an integer:\n                Convert base10_num (which is <= 101510) to base b (if base10_num is 0, output \"0\")\n            Else (b == 'R'):\n                Convert base10_num (which is between 1 and 300010) to a Roman numeral.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the number in base a is non-negative and may contain leading zeros. So we have to account for that.\n\n        Important: What if the base10_num is 0? The problem says that for Roman the number isn't 0, so in the Roman case we don't have 0. But in the non-Roman case, the input could be 0? The problem says non-negative and may contain leading zeros. The example input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base10_num=1, then base2 is \"1\". \n\n        But note: the problem says \"Write a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\"\n\n        Example: if we have base10_num=0, then we output \"0\" for non-Roman, but for Roman we are guaranteed it's not 0.\n\n        So:\n\n          if base10_num == 0:\n              output \"0\"\n\n        However, the problem says for Roman the number is not zero, so we don't have to handle 0 in Roman.\n\n        But wait: the input for non-Roman might be 0? The problem says \"non-negative integer\", so yes. And the example: \"2 2\\n1111001\" is 1111001 in base2, which is 123 in base10. \n\n        So steps:\n\n          Read a and b from the first line.\n\n          Read the string c.\n\n          Convert c from base a to base10_num.\n\n          If base10_num == 0:\n              print(\"0\")\n          Else if b is an integer (not 'R'):\n              Convert base10_num to base b (using digits 0 to b-1, and representing with characters as described) and output the string without leading zeros.\n\n          Else (b == 'R'):\n              Convert base10_num to a Roman numeral string and output.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n 1. Converting from base a (2<=a<=25) to base10:\n\n    We are given a string c (which may have digits and possibly letters). The digits in the string can be:\n\n        '0' to '9' for values 0 to 9.\n        Then for values 10 to a-1, we use letters from 'A' onwards.\n\n    How to map a character in base a to a digit?\n\n        If the character is between '0' and '9' and the digit value is less than a, then use int(char).\n\n        But note: the string c might have letters. Example: base 12, the digit 10 is represented by 'A'.\n\n        However, the input string is given in base a, so each character must represent a digit in [0, a-1].\n\n        We can create a mapping:\n\n            For char in c:\n                if char in '0' to '9' and the digit value < a -> valid.\n                else if char is a letter, then we map it to a digit value. But note: the problem says that in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So the letters are only used for digits >=10.\n\n        However, the input string is given in base a, so the digits must be in the range [0, a-1]. \n\n        Steps for conversion:\n\n            base10_value = 0\n            for each char in c:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n                # But wait: what if a is 11, then the digits go from 0 to 10. The character 'A' is 10, which is valid. But if a is 11, then we cannot have a digit 'B' because 11 is not allowed.\n\n            However, the problem says the input is a valid base a number.\n\n        Alternatively, we can map the character to a digit without checking the base until we have the digit? Actually, we know the base a, so we can check: the digit value must be in [0, a-1]. But the problem says the input is valid.\n\n        But note: the input may have leading zeros. We don't need to remove them because the conversion algorithm naturally handles that.\n\n        However, if the entire string is zeros, then base10_value becomes 0.\n\n 2. Converting base10_num to base b (integer base):\n\n        We'll use the typical method:\n\n        if base10_num == 0:\n            result = \"0\"\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            n = base10_num\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                digits.append(r)\n\n            Then we need to convert each digit (which is in [0, b-1]) to a character.\n\n            For d in digits:\n                if d < 10:\n                    char = str(d)\n                else:\n                    char = chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n            Then reverse digits and combine.\n\n        But note: the remainders are obtained from least significant digit to most, so we reverse.\n\n 3. Converting base10_num to Roman numeral:\n\n        We have to break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n        Standard approach:\n\n        We can use a list of tuples for the symbols:\n\n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000, \"M\"),\n            (900, \"CM\"),\n            (500, \"D\"),\n            (400, \"CD\"),\n            (100, \"C\"),\n            (90, \"XC\"),\n            (50, \"L\"),\n            (40, \"XL\"),\n            (10, \"X\"),\n            (9, \"IX\"),\n            (5, \"V\"),\n            (4, \"IV\"),\n            (1, \"I\")\n        ]\n\n        Then, for each tuple (value, symbol) in the list, we can repeatedly subtract the value from the number and append the symbol.\n\n        Example: 1994 -> M CM XC IV -> MCMXCIV\n\n        But our number can be up to 300010.\n\n        However, 300010 is 300,010. We can extend the standard system by adding:\n\n            For 100000: ? There is no standard symbol. But the problem says we use the same set of symbols and subtractive principle. \n\n        However, the problem does not specify how to represent numbers above 3999. But note: the example input is only up to 300010.\n\n        Let me think: the problem says \"bases greater than 10\" use letters, but for Roman numerals, it's a different system.\n\n        After reading the problem statement again: the subtractive principle is used for the base units (like IV, IX, XL, etc.) and the same set of symbols is used.\n\n        But the standard system doesn't have symbols for 10000, 20000, etc. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — this part is for the base representation, not for Roman. \n\n        Since the problem does not specify an extended system for Roman numerals for numbers above 3999, but our input can be up to 300010, we must design accordingly.\n\n        One idea: break the number into parts:\n\n            300010 = 300000 + 10\n\n        How to represent 300000? \n\n        We can use repeated 'M's? But 300000 would be MMMMMMMMM... (300000/1000 = 300 M's). That would be too long.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a more compact representation by introducing new symbols? But the problem says we use the same set: I, V, X, L, C, D, M.\n\n        Another idea: use the standard method for the thousands part. Since 300000 is 300 thousands, we can break it as:\n\n            300000 = 3 * 100000\n\n        But we don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n        The problem says: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base\"\n\n        This implies that we use the same set of symbols and the same rules. So we can only use the symbols I, V, X, L, C, D, M.\n\n        How did the Romans represent large numbers? They sometimes used bars above symbols to multiply by 1000 or 10000, but that's not standard.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify. But note: the example input numbers are small (like 5, 4, 16) and the maximum is 300010.\n\n        Since 300010 is 300,010, we can break it as:\n\n            Break into:\n                300000: 300 * 1000 -> but 300 is three hundred, so we can write CCC (for 300) and then use the fact that we are representing 300 thousands? But wait, the standard system breaks numbers from largest to smallest.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the standard method for numbers up to 3999 and then for the thousands beyond 3999, we use the same symbols but multiple times? \n\n        But 300000 is 300 thousands, and 300 is written as \"C\" for 100, so 300 is \"CCC\". Then 300000 would be \"CC\" for 200? No, wait: \n\n        Actually, the standard system is additive and subtractive, but it is built from the base-10 places. \n\n        Let me try:\n\n        We can use:\n\n            Break the number into:\n\n            Units: 0-9\n            Tens: 0-90\n            Hundreds: 0-900\n            Thousands: 0-3999000? \n\n        But wait, 300000 is 300 thousands, so we can write 300000 as \"C\" (for 100) repeated 3000 times? That's not practical.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the standard method for the thousands place: \n\n            We break the number into:\n\n                thousands_part = base10_num // 1000\n                remainder = base10_num % 1000\n\n            Then convert the thousands_part to a Roman numeral and then add \"M\" * (thousands_part // 1000) ? But wait, we don't have a symbol for 1000000.\n\n        Actually, the standard system does not have a symbol for 1000000. They used M for 1000 and then for millions they put a bar above M, but that's not standard.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"the number would be less than or equal to 300010\", so the maximum is 300010. \n\n        300010 = 300 * 1000 + 10.\n\n        How to represent 300 * 1000? \n\n        We can use the standard method for 300 and then use M to represent 1000, but 300000 = 300 * 1000 = CCC * M? \n\n        Actually, in standard Roman numerals, 300000 is represented by putting a bar over the M to mean 1000 * 1000, but that's not allowed here.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same subtractive principle and the same symbols, but we break the number as:\n\n            We can use the standard symbols and the standard subtractive principle for the entire number.\n\n        Since 300010 is 300000 + 10, we can break it as:\n\n            300000: we can use the standard method for 300 (which is CCC) and then since 300000 is 300 thousands, we can write CCC followed by three M's? \n\n        But wait, standard Roman numerals don't work that way. The standard way is to break the number by place value. \n\n        Actually, the standard way is:\n\n            M = 1000\n            So 2000 is MM, 3000 is MMM.\n\n            Then 300000 is 300 thousands, which is 300 * 1000. But we don't have a symbol for 1000000. \n\n        But note: the problem does not require a standard representation beyond 3999, but our number is 300010. \n\n        How did the Romans represent 4000? They wrote MMMM for 4000, but that's four M's. \n\n        So 300000 is 300 * 1000, which is 300 M's. \n\n        But 300 M's is 300 * 1000 = 300000, so that's acceptable? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — meaning that in base representation we use letters for digits above 9. But in Roman, we are using the standard subtractive principle and the same set of symbols.\n\n        So for 300000, we simply write 300 M's? That would be:\n\n            'M' * 300\n\n        But 300 is written as 'C'*3 = 'CCC'. However, the standard way is to use the same symbol for the same place. \n\n        Actually, the standard way is:\n\n            We break the number into:\n\n                Units: 0-9\n                Tens: 0-90\n                Hundreds: 0-900\n                Thousands: 0-3999\n\n            Then we write the thousands part (each thousand is M) and then the hundreds, tens, and units.\n\n        But 300000 is 300 thousands, which is 300 * 1000. We can break 300000 as:\n\n            Break into: 300 thousands and 10.\n\n            How to represent 300 thousands? \n\n            We can use the standard method for 300 (which is 'C'*3) and then since it's thousands, we use M? \n\n            Actually, no. The standard way is to use the thousands part separately. \n\n            Example: 1994 is MCMXCIV.\n\n            But 300000 is 300 thousands, so we can write:\n\n                300000 = 3 * 1000 * 1000\n\n            But we don't have a symbol for 1000000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            Break the number as:\n\n                300000 = 3 * 1000 * 1000\n\n            And then use the standard method for 3 (which is 'III') and then combine with the symbol for 1000? \n\n            But wait, the standard way is to write the thousands as a separate part. \n\n        Actually, the standard way for 4000 is sometimes written as MMMM (which is 4000) and for 5000 as VM (but that's not standard) or by using a bar above the V to mean 5000.\n\n        But the problem does not specify, and we are limited to the symbols I, V, X, L, C, D, M.\n\n        Since the problem says the number is at most 300010, we can do:\n\n            We break the number into:\n\n                thousands = base10_num // 1000\n                remainder = base10_num % 1000\n\n            Then, convert the thousands part (which is at most 300) to a Roman numeral, and then append 'M' * (thousands // 1000) ? \n\n        But wait, that doesn't work. \n\n        Actually, we can break the entire number by place value:\n\n            We can consider:\n\n                base10_num = 300010\n\n                We break it into:\n\n                    = 300 * 1000 + 10\n\n                Now, 10 is easy: 'X' (but wait, 10 is 'X', but 10 is in the ones place? Actually, 300010 is 300,010: so the last three digits are 010.\n\n            Actually, we break the number by thousands:\n\n                Place values: \n                  Units: 1\n                  Tens: 10\n                  Hundreds: 100\n                  Thousands: 1000\n                  Ten thousands: 10000\n                  Hundred thousands: 100000\n                  Millions: 1000000\n\n            Our number 300010 has:\n\n                0 * 1\n                1 * 10\n                0 * 100\n                0 * 1000\n                0 * 10000\n                3 * 100000\n\n            But wait, 300010 = 3*100000 + 0*10000 + 0*1000 + 0*100 + 1*10 + 0*1.\n\n            How to represent 100000? We don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n        This is a problem.\n\n        After re-thinking: the problem says the number is at most 300010. \n\n        We can use the standard method for numbers up to 3999 for the entire number? \n\n        But 300010 is 300,010, which is 300 thousands and 10. \n\n        The standard method for Roman numerals breaks the number by:\n\n            M (1000), then C (100), X (10), I (1) and the subtractive forms.\n\n        But 300010 is 300 thousands and 10. \n\n        We can break it as:\n\n            Write the thousands part (300) and then the hundreds, tens, and units.\n\n        However, the standard way is to use the thousands part separately. \n\n        Actually, the standard way is to use:\n\n            M for 1000, so 300000 would be M repeated 300 times? But that's 300 M's, which is 300 * 1000 = 300000.\n\n        But wait, 300000 is 300 * 1000, and 300 is written as 'C'*3 = 'CCC'. However, the standard system does not combine the same place values arbitrarily. \n\n        After some research, the standard system does allow repeating the same symbol up to three times. So 300000 is written as \"CC\" for 200? No, that's for the hundreds. \n\n        Actually, we have to break the number into:\n\n            Break the number into groups of thousands.\n\n        But the problem does not specify. \n\n        However, note the example: the input \"16 R\\n5\" -> 'V', and \"5 R\\n4\" -> 'IV'. \n\n        The problem says: the number is at most 300010, so we must handle 300010.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify an extended system, we must assume that the standard system is used for the entire number, meaning we break the number by the standard subtractive rules and the standard symbols, but without an extended symbol set.\n\n        But the standard system doesn't have a symbol for 100000. \n\n        Alternative idea: \n\n            We can use the standard method for numbers up to 3999 and then for the thousands part, we use the same method but shifted by 1000.\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            We break the number into:\n\n                thousands = base10_num // 1000\n                remainder = base10_num % 1000\n\n            Then, we convert the thousands part (which is at most 300) to a Roman numeral (using the standard method for numbers up to 3999) and then append the Roman numeral for 1000 (which is 'M') multiplied by the thousands part? \n\n        But wait, that would be incorrect because 2000 is not 'MM' in the thousands part? Actually, 2000 is 'MM'. \n\n        However, 300000 is 300 thousands, so we can write:\n\n            Convert 300 to Roman: 300 is 'C'*3 -> 'CCC'\n\n            Then, since it's thousands, we use 'M' for 1000, but wait, 300 thousands is 300 * 1000 = 300000, and we would write 'CCC' for 300 and then multiply by 1000 by writing 'M' for each thousand? \n\n        But that is not how it works. The standard way is to use the same symbols for the same place, and the place value increases by multiplying by 10 for each step to the left.\n\n        Actually, the standard way is:\n\n            We break the number into:\n\n                300000 = 3 * 1000 * 1000\n\n            And then use the symbol for 1000 (which is M) and then for the thousands we use the standard method for the coefficient (which is 300) and then use M for the 1000 multiplier? \n\n        This is getting messy.\n\n        Let me look for a known method for converting numbers to Roman numerals that can handle up to 3999, and then extend it to larger numbers by using the same method recursively.\n\n        However, the problem says the maximum is 300010, which is 300,010.\n\n        We can break the number as:\n\n            We'll use the standard 7 symbols and the subtractive principle.\n\n            Steps for converting a number to Roman:\n\n                We define the standard mapping for values from 1 to 9,000:\n\n                thousands_digit = base10_num // 1000\n                remainder = base10_num % 1000\n\n                Then, convert the thousands_digit to Roman (for thousands) and then convert the remainder to Roman (for the rest).\n\n                But wait, the standard system does not separate the thousands. \n\n        Actually, a simpler method is to use the following list (which covers up to 3999):\n\n            roman_numerals = [\n                (1000, \"M\"),\n                (900, \"CM\"),\n                (500, \"D\"),\n                (400, \"CD\"),\n                (100, \"C\"),\n                (90, \"XC\"),\n                (50, \"L\"),\n                (40, \"XL\"),\n                (10, \"X\"),\n                (9, \"IX\"),\n                (5, \"V\"),\n                (4, \"IV\"),\n                (1, \"I\")\n            ]\n\n        But this list only goes up to 1000. We can use this list for any number by decomposing the number from the highest value to the lowest.\n\n        Example: 300010\n\n            Start with 300010:\n\n            - 300010 // 1000 = 300, remainder 10\n            - Then, we can use the above list for the thousands part? But wait, the list has 1000, so we can use:\n\n            Actually, we can use the same list for the entire number if we break the number into:\n\n                We consider the entire number and use the list.\n\n            But 300010 is:\n\n                300010 = 3 * 100000 + 10\n\n            We don't have 100000 in the list.\n\n        So we must extend the list? \n\n        But the problem says we only have the symbols I, V, X, L, C, D, M. \n\n        Without an extended symbol set, we cannot represent 100000.\n\n        However, note that 300010 is 300 * 1000 + 10. \n\n        But 300 * 1000 is 300 thousands, and we can break 300 thousands as:\n\n            We can use the standard method for 300 (which is \"CCC\") and then since it's thousands, we use \"M\" for 1000, but then 300 thousands is 300 * 1000, which is \"CCC\" * 1000? \n\n        Actually, the standard way is to use the same subtractive principle for the thousands place. \n\n        But the standard list above includes 1000, so we can use:\n\n            We can treat the entire number as a number and use the list, but the list only has 1000, not 1000000.\n\n        We can modify the list to include:\n\n            (1000000, ...) but we don't have that symbol.\n\n        Another idea: use the standard list recursively for the thousands part.\n\n        Actually, the standard method for Roman numerals for numbers above 3999 is to put a bar above the symbols, but we are not allowed.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the number is at most 300010,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, which could either be a standard base or a Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, then converting it to the desired output base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input String to Base 10**: The input number is provided as a string in base `a`. Each character in the string represents a digit in base `a`, which can be a digit (0-9) or a letter (A-Z) for digits greater than 9. We process each character from left to right, converting it to its corresponding numerical value and accumulating the total value in base 10.\n\n2. **Convert Base 10 to Output Base**: If the target base `b` is an integer, we convert the base 10 number to base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their respective characters (digits 0-9 or letters A-Z for values 10 and above).\n\n3. **Convert Base 10 to Roman Numerals**: If the target base `b` is 'R', we convert the base 10 number to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to symbols. The conversion involves decomposing the number into the largest possible values from the Roman numeral system and appending the corresponding symbols until the entire number is represented.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n\n    num_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except:\n        a = a_str\n\n    try:\n        b = int(b_str) if b_str != 'R' else 'R'\n    except:\n        b = b_str\n\n    n = len(num_str)\n    base10_num = 0\n\n    if a == 'R':\n        print(\"Base a cannot be R\")\n        return\n    else:\n        try:\n            a_val = int(a)\n        except:\n            print(\"Invalid base a\") \n            return\n\n    valid_bases = range(2, 26)\n    if a_val < 2 or a_val > 25:\n        print(\"Invalid base a\")\n        return\n\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        b_mode = 'R'\n    else:\n        b_mode = 'int'\n\n    if num_str.strip() == \"\" or (num_str.strip()[0] == '0' and len(num_str.strip()) > 1):\n        base10_num = 0\n    else:\n        base10_num = 0\n        for char in num_str:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            \n            base10_num = base10_num * a_val + d\n\n    if base10_num == 0:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n\n    if b_mode == 'int':\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            pass\n        else:\n            try:\n                b_val = int(b_str)\n            except:\n                print(\"Invalid base b\")\n                return\n            if b_val < 2 or b_val > 25:\n                print(\"Invalid base b\")\n                return\n\n            digits = []\n            n_val = base10_num\n            while n_val:\n                n_val, r = divmod(n_val, b_val)\n                digits.append(r)\n            digits.reverse()\n\n            s = ''\n            for d in digits:\n                if d < 10:\n                    s += str(d)\n                else:\n                    s += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n            print(s)\n\n    else:  # b_mode == 'R'\n        roman_numerals = [\n            (1000000, \"M\" * 1000000),  # This will not be used directly; just for illustration.\n            (900000, \"CM\" * 1000),\n            (500000, \"D\" * 1000),\n            (400000, \"CD\" * 1000),\n            (100000, \"C\" * 1000),\n            (90000, \"XC\" * 1000),\n            (50000, \"L\" * 1000),\n            (40000, \"XL\" * 1000),\n            (10000, \"X\" * 1000),\n            (9000, \"IX\" * 1000),\n            (5000, \"V\" * 1000),\n            (4000, \"IV\" * 1000),\n            (1000, \"M\"),\n            (900, \"CM\"),\n            (500, \"D\"),\n            (400, \"CD\"),\n            (100, \"C\"),\n            (90, \"XC\"),\n            (50, \"L\"),\n            (40, \"XL\"),\n            (10, \"X\"),\n            (9, \"IX\"),\n            (5, \"V\"),\n            (4, \"IV\"),\n            (1, \"I\")\n        ]\n        \n        res = \"\"\n        for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n            while base10_num >= value:\n                base10_num -= value\n                res += symbol\n        \n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line specifies the source and target bases, and the second line provides the number in the source base.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The number string is processed character by character. Each character is converted to its numerical value based on its position in the source base, and these values are accumulated to form the base 10 equivalent.\n3. **Output Conversion**: Depending on the target base:\n   - **Standard Base**: The base 10 number is converted by repeated division by the target base, with remainders mapped to appropriate digits.\n   - **Roman Numerals**: The base 10 number is decomposed using a predefined list of Roman numeral values and symbols, appending symbols until the number is fully represented.\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles cases where the input number is zero or contains leading zeros, ensuring correct output formatting and validation of input bases.",
