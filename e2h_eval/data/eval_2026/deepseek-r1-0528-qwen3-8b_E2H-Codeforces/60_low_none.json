Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S (in Morse code). Note: The entire string S is built by appending one character (either '0' or '1') at a time.\n\n Important: There are 30 possible strings (from length 1 to 4) but 4 are invalid. So there are 26 valid Morse codes.\n\n However, note: Some substrings might represent multiple letters? But the problem says: \"each Morse code representation of an English letter\" and \"each string ... translates into a distinct English letter\", so each valid string corresponds to exactly one letter.\n\n But note: There are 26 letters, and the set of valid strings is exactly the 26. So we can have multiple ways to form the same letter? Actually, no: the representation is fixed. For example, the letter 'T' is represented as \"1\", and that's the only representation for 'T'. Similarly, 'M' is \"11\", and 'O' is \"111\". \n\n However, note that sometimes the same string of bits might appear as multiple contiguous substrings (like in \"111\", the substring \"11\" appears twice). But we are not counting the same letter multiple times? Actually, the problem says \"distinct non-empty sequences of English letters\". \n\n Example: In \"111\", we have:\n   \"1\" -> T\n   \"11\" -> M\n   \"111\" -> O\n\n And then we can have sequences (which are just concatenations of letters) but note: the problem does not require that the entire sequence is formed by contiguous bits? Actually, it says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\"\n\n But note: the example counts:\n\n   \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n However, let's break down:\n\n   Substrings of \"111\" (considering the bits) are: \n      \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", \n      and the single letter representations: \n        \"1\" -> T\n        \"11\" -> M\n        \"111\" -> O\n\n   Then the sequences (which are words, i.e., one or more letters) must be such that the entire word's Morse code (when concatenated without separators) is a substring of S?\n\n   Actually, note: the example lists:\n      \"TT\": which is two T's -> Morse code \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\", which is a substring.\n\n   But also \"TM\": Morse code \"1\"+\"11\" = \"111\", which is a substring.\n\n   Similarly, \"MT\": \"11\"+\"1\" = \"111\", substring.\n\n   And \"TTT\": \"1\"*3 = \"111\", substring.\n\n   However, note that the substring \"11\" (which is M) is already present, and we are counting sequences (words) that are represented by some contiguous substring of S.\n\n   But note: the problem does not say that the entire word must be represented by a contiguous substring. It says: \"some substring of S\" (the entire string S? or the current string S?) \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\n\n   This means: We consider any contiguous substring of S, and if that substring (when interpreted as a Morse code string) is one of the 26 valid codes, then that substring corresponds to one letter. Then we can form words (sequences) by taking one or more consecutive letters (each letter being a contiguous substring of bits of length 1, 2, 3, or 4) and the entire word must be represented by a contiguous substring? \n\n   However, note: the example counts \"TT\", which is two T's. The Morse code for \"TT\" is \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\", which is a substring. But note: the substring \"11\" is contiguous and is of length 2. So we are not breaking the substring arbitrarily? Actually, the word \"TT\" is represented by the substring \"11\", which is contiguous.\n\n   But wait: what if we have a word that is longer than 4? Then the substring must be contiguous and of length up to 4? Actually, no: because the Morse code representation for a letter is from 1 to 4, and a word is a sequence of letters, so the entire word's Morse code is the concatenation of these codes. However, the problem does not require that the entire word is represented by a substring of S (without breaks) but rather that the entire word's Morse code (as a string) is contained as a contiguous",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some contiguous substring of a dynamically built string S. The string S is constructed by appending either '0' (dot) or '1' (dash) one at a time. Each valid Morse code string (length 1 to 4) corresponds to a unique English letter, except for four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending exactly at position `i` in the string S. This helps us efficiently compute the number of new valid sequences formed as we extend S with each new character.\n2. **Tracking Valid Substrings**: For each new character appended to S, we check all possible substrings ending at the current position that could form valid Morse code strings (lengths 1 to 4). For each valid substring found, we update the DP array and maintain a set (or another DP array) to keep track of all valid sequences encountered so far.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, all operations are performed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThe key insight is that each new character allows us to form new valid sequences by combining it with previous valid sequences or starting a new sequence. The solution efficiently updates the count of valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming and careful tracking of valid substrings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s_list = []\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        s_list.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    valid_set = set()\n    total_valid = 0\n    ans_lines = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(s_list, start=1):\n        new_sequences = set()\n        dp[i] = 0\n        \n        for length in range(1, 5):\n            start_index = max(0, i - length)\n            substr = ''.join(s_list[j] for j in range(start_index, i))\n            \n            if len(substr) < length:\n                break\n                \n            if substr in valid_set:\n                continue\n                \n            if substr == \"0011\" or substr == \"0101\" or substr == \"1110\" or substr == \"1111\":\n                continue\n                \n            valid_set.add(substr)\n            total_valid += 1\n            new_sequences.add(substr)\n            dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD\n            \n            # Update total sequences count\n            prev_count = dp[start_index] if start_index > 0 else 0\n            total_valid = (total_valid + prev_count) % MOD\n        \n        ans_lines.append(str(total_valid % MOD))\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(ans_lines))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values and initializes necessary variables, including a DP array `dp` to keep track of valid sequences ending at each position, a set `valid_set` to store all valid Morse code substrings encountered, and a counter `total_valid` to accumulate the total number of valid sequences.\n2. **Processing Each Character**: For each character added to the string S, the code checks all possible substrings ending at the current position (from length 1 to 4). If a substring is valid (i.e., not one of the four invalid strings), it is added to `valid_set`, and the count of new valid sequences is updated.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Update**: The DP array is updated to reflect the number of valid sequences ending at the current position. This involves checking how many valid sequences can be formed by appending the current character to existing sequences.\n4. **Output**: After processing each character, the current total number of valid sequences is recorded and printed after all characters have been processed.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming and set operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
