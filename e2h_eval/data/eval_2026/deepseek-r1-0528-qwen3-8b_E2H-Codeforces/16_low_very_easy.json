Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and a set of n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a common border of nonzero length.\n\n Observation: Each road is an infinite line. The movement condition is that two blocks must share a common segment (not just a point). This is equivalent to saying we can cross a road only by stepping into an adjacent block at the crossing of two or more roads? Actually, note that when you cross one road, you step from one block to an adjacent block. But the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n However, note: the common border is defined by the intersection of two roads? Actually, no: the common border between two blocks is a segment of one of the roads. But wait, the problem states that the roads are infinite lines. The blocks are separated by these lines. So two adjacent blocks share a portion of one of the roads as their border.\n\n But note: the example input and output: \n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n        Output: 2\n\n Explanation: \n   The first road: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0 -> y=0 (the x-axis)\n   The second road: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0 -> x=0 (the y-axis)\n\n   The home (1,1) is in the first quadrant, and the university (-1,-1) is in the third quadrant. To get from first to third, we have to cross two roads: first cross the x-axis then the y-axis, or vice versa. However, note that the problem says: \"in one step\" we can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero border. In this case, moving from the first quadrant to the second requires crossing the x-axis (so one step) and then from the second to the third requires crossing the y-axis (another step). But wait, we could also go from first to fourth by crossing the y-axis, then from fourth to third by crossing the x-axis. However, the direct path from (1,1) to (-1,-1) must cross both axes, so two steps.\n\n However, note that we don't necessarily have to cross the roads in order? Actually, the movement is defined by the blocks. The key idea: \n\n Each road divides the plane. We can assign a sign to each road for the home and for the university.\n\n For a road equation: a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0, we can define the side of the road by the sign of a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i.\n\n Then, two points (and hence two blocks) are separated by a road if the signs for that road are different.\n\n Now, note: to go from home to university, we must cross every road for which the home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\n But wait, the problem doesn't require crossing every road? Actually, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points? Not exactly.\n\n However, consider: each time we cross a road, we change the side for that road. We start at home and end at university. We must have the same side configuration as the university for all roads. Therefore, we must cross every road an odd number of times. But we can cross multiple roads at the same time if we pass through an intersection (then we cross multiple roads in one step).\n\n But note the problem: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\"\n\n This means we can cross one or more roads at once if we step over an intersection (i.e., a point where at least two roads meet). However, the problem does not specify that we can cross multiple roads in one step, but note: when we cross from one block to an adjacent block, the common border is a segment of one road. But wait, actually the blocks are separated by entire roads. The common border between two blocks is a segment of one road? Or is it the entire road? \n\n Actually, the plane is divided by n lines. Two blocks that are adjacent share a segment of one of the roads. However, if two blocks are separated by two different roads, then they are not adjacent. But note: if we are at an intersection (multiple roads meet), then we can cross multiple roads at the same time? \n\n However, the movement condition is: the common border must be nonzero. When two blocks share a border, that border is a portion of one road. Therefore, we cannot cross two roads at the same time. \n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing one or more roads (lines) that divide the plane into connected regions (blocks). The key observation is that each road separates the plane into two half-planes, and the home and university blocks are located in specific half-planes relative to each road. The minimal number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that separate the two points, as each step can cross one or more roads only if they are adjacent.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem reduces to checking for each road whether the home and university lie on opposite sides. If they do, crossing that road is necessary to reach the destination. Each such road must be crossed an odd number of times, but since we can cross multiple roads in a single step if they are adjacent (i.e., their intersection allows it), the minimal steps required is simply the number of roads that separate the two points.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, compute the sign of the linear equation (aix + by + ci) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points and must be crossed at least once.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over each road, evaluate the linear equation for both points, and count how many roads have differing signs for the two points. This count gives the minimal steps required, as each such road requires at least one crossing, and crossings can be done in steps where multiple roads are crossed if they intersect appropriately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    n = int(data[4])\n    \n    roads = []\n    index = 5\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n    \n    count = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0):\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the coordinates of the home and university, the number of roads, and the coefficients defining each road.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, the linear equation ax + by + c is evaluated at both the home and university coordinates. If the signs of these evaluations differ, the road separates the two points, and a step counter is incremented.\n3. **Output Result**: The total count of such roads gives the minimal number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block, as each step can cross one or more roads if they intersect appropriately.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions for movement between blocks by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and half-planes, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
