The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (from 1 to n, then back to 1), we can consider the movement in two directions.\n\n However, note: the problem states that Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in order. \n The key is: for the i-th task, she must be in house a_i and also have completed all tasks with numbers less than i.\n\n Since the ringroad is one-way clockwise, moving from house x to house y:\n   If x <= y: then the distance is (y - x) mod n? But wait, because it's a ring, we might have two ways: \n   Actually, because it's one-way clockwise, we can only move clockwise. So going from x to y:\n        Option 1: if y >= x, then we can go directly: y - x steps.\n        Option 2: but wait, we can also go around the ring? However, the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one\" takes 1 unit, and we are moving clockwise.\n\n But note: the example: n=4, tasks [3,2,3]. \n    Start at 1, then to 3: 1->2->3 (2 steps). Then from 3 to 2: we cannot go counterclockwise. So we must go 3->4->1->2 (3 steps). Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 step). Total = 2+3+1 = 6.\n\n However, note the problem says \"Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house\", so if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, we don't need to move.\n\n How do we compute the minimal time?\n\n Observation: \n   Since we must complete the tasks in order, we start at house 1, then go to a1, then from a1 to a2, ... until am.\n\n But note: the ring is circular and we are forced to move clockwise. Therefore, from a current house 'cur' to the next task house 'next', \n   the distance is (next - cur) mod n, but because we can only go clockwise, we cannot take the modulo that wraps the other way? \n\n Actually, let's define:\n   If next >= cur, then the clockwise distance is (next - cur).\n   If next < cur, then the clockwise distance is (n - cur + next)   [because we go from cur to the end (house n) and then from 1 to next]\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the entire circle is n, so the clockwise distance from cur to next is:\n      (next - cur) % n   but if negative, we adjust by adding n and then mod n? However, note: we cannot use modulus for negative and then mod n because we want the positive clockwise distance.\n\n Actually, the clockwise distance from cur to next is:\n      if next >= cur: d = next - cur\n      else: d = n - cur + next\n\n But wait, we can also consider the entire ring as having two segments. However, note that the problem doesn't allow backward movement. \n\n Alternatively, we can compute the distance from cur to next in a clockwise manner without conditionals:\n\n      d = (next - cur) % n\n      But if d is negative, we add n and then take modulo? Actually, we want the positive value for clockwise, so:\n\n      d = (next - cur) % n\n      But if d is negative, then we do d = (next - cur + n) % n, but wait: when next < cur, (next - cur) is negative, then (next - cur + n) is positive and that gives the clockwise distance.\n\n However, note that in modular arithmetic, we can also do:\n      d = (next - cur + n) % n   but wait, if next>=cur, then (next-cur+n) % n = (next-cur) % n, but if next>=cur, then (next-cur) is between 0 and n-1, so modulo n doesn't change it. But if next < cur, then (next-cur+n) is positive and less than n (because next>=1, cur<=n, so next-cur+n >= 1-n+n = 1, and <= n-1+n? Actually, no: since next>=1 and cur<=n, then next-cur+n >= 1-n+n = 1, and next-cur+n <= n-1+n? Actually, no: next can be 1 and cur can be n, then 1-n+n=1, which is correct.\n\n But wait: if next=1 and cur=n, then (1-n+n) = 1, and the actual distance should be 1 (from n to 1: clockwise: n->1 is 1 step). Correct.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation on (next - cur + n) will give a value in the range [0, n-1] but if we do modulus by n, then (next-cur+n) % n is just (next-cur) % n, but when negative we adjusted by adding n. But actually, (next-cur+n) is always positive and less than 2*n, so modulus n might not be necessary because we know the distance is at most n-1.\n\n But wait: the distance from cur to next in a clockwise ring of n houses, when next < cur, is (n - cur + next). This is the same as (next - cur + n) because (n - cur + next) = (next - cur + n). \n\n So we can write: d = (next - cur + n) % n   but note: if (next - cur) is positive and less than n, then (next-cur+n) % n is (next-cur) because (next-cur+n) is between 0 and 2n-1, and if next-cur is positive and less than n, then (next-cur+n) is between n and 2n-1, so modulo n would be (next-cur) (because (next-cur+n) - n = next-cur). \n\n Actually, this formula does not give the desired result for the case when next>=cur. We want the distance to be (next-cur). But (next-cur+n) % n is (next-cur) when next-cur is in [0, n-1] (which it is) because (next-cur) is nonnegative and less than n, so (next-cur+n) % n = (next-cur) % n = next-cur (if next-cur is less than n). \n\n But wait, if next-cur is exactly n, then (next-cur+n) % n = n % n = 0, but that should be 0? Actually, if next = cur+n, then modulo n, next % n = cur, so we are effectively at the same house. However, in our problem, the houses are numbered 1..n, so next and cur are in [1, n]. Therefore, next-cur is at most n-1 (if next=1 and cur=2, then next-cur is negative; but if next=2 and cur=1, then next-cur=1). \n\n Actually, the condition is: we are moving from cur to next in a ring of n houses. The clockwise distance is the smallest nonnegative integer d such that (cur + d) mod n = next mod n, but note: the ring is labeled 1..n, and we are moving from cur to next. \n\n However, the problem does not wrap around the labels: the houses are fixed. We have to consider the absolute positions.\n\n Let me reframe: we have a linear arrangement from 1 to n, and then after n comes 1 again. So the entire circle has n houses. \n\n The clockwise distance from cur to next is:\n      If next >= cur: d = next - cur\n      Else: d = n - cur + next\n\n We can combine with modulus? Actually, the above two cases can be written as:\n      d = (next - cur) % n   but if (next - cur) is negative, then we add n and then take modulo n, but wait: \n\n Alternatively, we can use: d = (next - cur) % n\n But note: if next < cur, then (next - cur) is negative, and (next-cur) % n in Python gives a nonnegative remainder. However, in Python, the modulus operation for negative numbers: \n      (a % n) returns a value between 0 and n-1. For example: (-1 % 4) gives 3, which is what we want for the clockwise distance from 4 to 1: (1-4) = -3, then (-3 % 4) = 1? That's not right.\n\n Let me test: \n      n=4, cur=4, next=1: \n          (1-4) = -3, then -3 % 4 = 1, but the clockwise distance from 4 to 1 is 1 (since 4->1 is one step). Correct.\n\n      n=4, cur=2, next=3: (3-2)=1, 1 %4=1 -> correct.\n\n      n=4, cur=3, next=2: (2-3)=-1, -1 %4 = 3 -> which is the clockwise distance: 3->4->1->2 (3 steps). Correct.\n\n So indeed, the clockwise distance from cur to next is: (next - cur) % n, but wait: if (next - cur) is negative, then we get a positive value that is the number of steps going around the ring. However, note that (next - cur) % n is defined as the remainder, which in this case is the clockwise distance.\n\n But wait: what if (next - cur) is positive and greater than or equal to n?\n      Example: n=4, cur=1, next=5. But note: next is given as an integer between 1 and n, so next=5 is not allowed. So we are safe because next is in [1,n].\n\n Therefore, we can compute the distance from cur to next as (next - cur) % n, but wait: if (next - cur) is positive and less than n, then (next-cur) % n is next-cur, which is correct. And if (next-cur) is negative, then we get the correct positive distance.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers: \n      a % n = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n But we want the clockwise distance. The above examples show that (next - cur) % n gives the correct clockwise distance when we are moving from cur to next (considering the ring).\n\n But wait: what if the movement is from 1 to 1? (next=cur=1): (1-1)%4=0 -> correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says that Xenia starts at house 1. Then she goes to a1, then from a1 to a2, etc.\n\n But here's the catch: the entire journey is sequential. We start at house 1 (current position). Then we move to a1 (the first task). Then from a1 to a2, etc.\n\n So total time = distance(1, a1) + distance(a1, a2) + ... + distance(a_{m-1}, a_m)\n\n However, note: the example input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> \n        a1=3, a2=2, a3=3.\n\n        Step1: from 1 to 3: (3-1)%4 = 2 %4 = 2 -> 2 steps.\n        Step2: from 3 to 2: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3 -> 3 steps.\n        Step3: from 2 to 3: (3-2)%4 = 1 -> 1 step.\n        Total = 2+3+1 = 6.\n\n Another example: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n        a1=2, a2=3, a3=3.\n        Step1: from 1 to 2: (2-1)%4=1\n        Step2: from 2 to 3: (3-2)%4=1\n        Step3: from 3 to 3: (3-3)%4=0\n        Total=1+1+0=2.\n\n So that matches the sample outputs.\n\n But wait, what about going from a1 to a2 when a2 is behind a1? We are using modulus and it gives the clockwise distance.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation we are using is giving the same result as the two-case condition.\n\n Therefore, we can simply:\n\n   total_time = 0\n   current = 1\n   for each task_location in the list of tasks (m times):\n        d = (task_location - current) % n\n        But wait: if (task_location - current) is negative, then we get a positive d (as above). However, note that the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers returns a value between 0 and n-1. But is that always the clockwise distance?\n\n        Actually, the clockwise distance from current to task_location is the smallest nonnegative d such that (current + d) % n == task_location % n, but note that our houses are from 1 to n. However, the modulus operation is defined on integers, and we are using the same modulus n.\n\n        But note: the modulus n doesn't account for the fact that house n is the last and then 1 is the next. However, the problem doesn't label the houses modulo n (they are fixed). But our calculation:\n\n            (current + d) % n = (current + (task_location - current + k*n)) % n for some integer k? Actually, we are just using the modulus to compute the distance.\n\n        However, observe: \n            (current + d) % n = (current + ((task_location - current) % n)) % n\n\n        But note: (task_location - current) % n is defined as the remainder when dividing (task_location - current) by n, which is the same as the clockwise distance.\n\n        But wait: the equation (current + d) % n = task_location % n must hold. However, note that our houses are labeled 1 to n, and we are representing them as integers. The modulus n operation doesn't necessarily map the house labels to 0-indexed, but note:\n\n            Let's define the houses as 1-indexed. Then the clockwise distance from current to task_location is the smallest nonnegative d such that:\n\n                (current + d) mod n = task_location mod n\n\n            But note: the modulus operation for current+d might be more than n, and then we take mod n. However, we want to know the actual path: we are moving in a circle of n houses, so the positions repeat every n.\n\n        Actually, the problem doesn't require the modulus to be taken for the entire journey, because the houses are fixed. But the modulus operation for the distance calculation is valid because:\n\n            We are effectively mapping the circle to the integers modulo n, but with a caveat: the house numbers are 1-indexed. \n\n        However, note: if we use the modulus n, then house 1 and house n+1 are the same modulo n? But wait, n+1 mod n = 1, so that matches. Similarly, house 2 and house n+2 are the same, etc.\n\n        But our calculation: (task_location - current) % n gives the clockwise distance. \n\n        However, let me check with a different modulus representation: we can consider the houses as 0-indexed internally for modulus? \n\n        Alternative approach: \n            Let's subtract 1 from every house number to make them 0-indexed. Then the ring has houses 0 to n-1.\n\n            Then the clockwise distance from current (0-indexed) to next (0-indexed) is (next - current) % n, but again if negative we adjust.\n\n        But wait, the modulus operation for 0-indexed: \n            In 0-indexed, the distance from current to next is (next - current) % n, and if negative, then (next - current + n) % n.\n\n        However, note: in 0-indexed, the modulus operation for negative is the same as in 1-indexed? \n\n        Actually, the problem is independent of the indexing as long as the relative positions are maintained. \n\n        But wait: the example in 0-indexed:\n            n=4, current=0 (house1), next=2 (house3): (2-0)%4=2 -> correct.\n            n=4, current=2 (house3), next=1 (house2): (1-2)%4 = (-1)%4=3 -> correct.\n\n        So the modulus operation works in 1-indexed as well.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation for (next - current) % n in 1-indexed gives the same result as in 0-indexed if we don't subtract 1? \n\n        But wait, the modulus operation is defined for the integers. The value of (next - current) % n is the same regardless of whether the houses are 1-indexed or 0-indexed? \n\n        Actually, no: the modulus operation is defined for the numerical value. \n\n        However, the problem: the ring has n houses, and the distance from current to next in the ring is independent of the indexing. The modulus operation we are using is based on the numerical values of the house numbers.\n\n        But note: the house numbers are from 1 to n. The modulus operation (with modulus n) will map:\n\n            House 1 -> 1 mod n\n            House 2 -> 2 mod n\n            ...\n            House n -> n mod n = 0.\n\n        Wait, that breaks the symmetry! \n\n        Example: n=4, current=4, next=1: \n            In 1-indexed: (1-4) % 4 = (-3) % 4 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        But if we had considered the houses as 0-indexed (subtract 1) then:\n            current = 3 (for house4), next = 0 (for house1): (0-3) % 4 = (-3)%4=1 -> same.\n\n        However, if we do the modulus without subtracting, the house numbers are just integers. The modulus n operation is defined as the remainder when dividing by n. \n\n        But note: the modulus operation does not require the numbers to be 0-indexed. It just uses the integer value.\n\n        Why is (1-4)%4 = 1? Because in mathematics, the remainder when dividing -3 by 4 is 1 (since -3 = -1*4 + 1). \n\n        So the modulus operation we are using is valid.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute the distance from current to next as: (next - current) % n, but wait: if (next - current) is positive and less than n, then we get the direct distance. If negative, we get the distance going clockwise via the next part of the ring.\n\n        However, there's a catch: the modulus operation in Python for positive numbers that are less than n is just the number itself. \n\n        But note: the modulus operation for a positive number x that is less than n: x % n = x.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            d = (next - current) % n\n            But wait, if (next - current) is negative, then we get a positive d. However, if (next - current) is positive and >= n, then we get (next - current) % n, which is (next - current) - n * floor((next-current)/n). \n\n        However, note that next and current are between 1 and n. Therefore, next - current is in the range [-n+1, n-1]. \n\n        But if next - current is positive and >= n? That would happen if next >= current + n. But next is at most n, and current is at least 1, so next - current <= n-1. Therefore, the maximum positive difference is n-1, so (next - current) % n is just next - current.\n\n        Similarly, the minimum negative difference is (1 - n) = -(n-1). \n\n        Therefore, the modulus operation will never reduce a positive difference (because positive differences are at most n-1, so they are less than n) and for negative differences, it adds n until the result is in [0, n-1].\n\n        So the formula is safe.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Read n and m.\n          Read the list of m integers.\n\n          current = 1\n          total_time = 0\n\n          for each location in the list:\n              d = (location - current) % n\n              But wait: what if d is 0? Then we don't move. That's correct.\n\n          However, wait: the modulus operation gives the distance, but note: if the distance is 0, then we don't move, but we are at the same house.\n\n          But note: the modulus operation for (location - current) % n might be 0 even if location==current, and that is correct.\n\n          However, there's a problem: the modulus operation returns the smallest nonnegative residue. But the clockwise distance from current to current is 0, which is correct.\n\n          But wait, what if the distance is calculated as 0, but we are already at the current house? Then we don't need to move.\n\n          However, note that the modulus operation is giving the correct clockwise distance.\n\n        But wait: what if the movement is from current to next, and next is behind current, but the modulus operation gives a distance that is the same as if we went the other way? \n\n        Actually, the modulus operation is designed for the ring and gives the minimal clockwise steps? Not exactly minimal in the entire ring, but the steps in the clockwise direction. \n\n        However, the problem says we can only move clockwise, so we must use the clockwise distance. \n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          current = 1\n          total_time = 0\n\n          for t in tasks:\n              # Compute the clockwise distance from current to t\n              # d = (t - current) % n\n              # But wait: if t < current, then (t - current) is negative, and modulus n gives a positive value (the clockwise distance). \n              # However, if t > current, then (t - current) is positive and less than n (because t<=n and current>=1, so t-current <= n-1), so modulus n is just t-current.\n\n              d = (t - current) % n\n              # However, note: if (t - current) is negative, then (t - current) % n is positive, and if positive then it's the direct distance.\n\n              # But wait, is there a possibility that (t - current) is positive and greater than or equal to n? No, because t and current are between 1 and n, so t - current is between 1-n and n-1.\n\n              total_time += d\n              current = t   # update current to the task location\n\n          print(total_time)\n\n        Let's test with the example: ['4 3\\n3 2 3']\n\n          n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n          current=1\n          t=3: d = (3-1)%4 = 2%4=2 -> total_time=2, current=3\n          t=2: d = (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4=3 -> total_time=5, current=2\n          t=3: d = (3-2)%4=1 -> total_time=6, current=3\n\n          Output: 6 -> correct.\n\n        Another example: ['4 3\\n2 3 3']\n          n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3]\n          current=1\n          t=2: d=(2-1)%4=1 -> total_time=1, current=2\n          t=3: d=(3-2)%4=1 -> total_time=2, current=3\n          t=3: d=(3-3)%4=0 -> total_time=2, current=3\n\n          Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the tasks are [1,2,3]?\n          n=4, tasks=[1,2,3]\n          current=1\n          t=1: d=(1-1)%4=0 -> total_time=0, current=1\n          t=2: d=(2-1)%4=1 -> total_time=1, current=2\n          t=3: d=(3-2)%4=1 -> total_time=2, current=3\n\n        That seems correct.\n\n        However, consider a different example: [4,1,2] for n=4\n          current=1\n          t=4: (4-1)%4=3 -> total_time=3, current=4\n          t=1: (1-4)%4= (-3)%4=1 -> total_time=4, current=1\n          t=2: (2-1)%4=1 -> total_time=5, current=2\n\n        Let me simulate: \n          Start at 1, then go to 4: 1->2->3->4 (3 steps)\n          Then from 4 to 1: 4->1 (1 step)\n          Then from 1 to 2: 1->2 (1 step)\n          Total: 3+1+1=5 -> correct.\n\n        One more: [4,2,1] for n=4\n          current=1\n          t=4: (4-1)%4=3 -> total_time=3, current=4\n          t=2: (2-4)%4= (-2)%4=2 -> total_time=5, current=2\n          t=1: (1-2)%4= (-1)%4=3 -> total_time=8, current=1\n\n        Simulation:\n          Start at 1 -> 4: 3 steps (1->2->3->4)\n          Then from 4 to 2: 4->1->2 (2 steps)\n          Then from 2 to 1: 2->3->4->1 (3 steps)\n          Total: 3+2+3=8 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          current = 1\n          total = 0\n          for t in tasks:\n              # Calculate the clockwise distance from current to t\n              diff = t - current\n              # If diff is negative, then we add n to get the positive distance (which is the modulus way)\n              # But modulus already does that, so we can use modulus.\n              d = diff % n\n              # However, wait: if diff is positive, then d = diff % n = diff (if diff < n). \n              # But note: if diff is positive and >= n, then we have to adjust. But our numbers are between 1 and n, so diff is at most n-1 (if t=n and current=1, then diff=n-1) and at least 1-n (if t=1 and current=n, then diff=1-n). \n              # Therefore, we can safely use modulus.\n\n              total += d\n              current = t\n\n          print(total)\n\n        But wait, is modulus the same as the clockwise distance? Yes, as we've seen.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation for a negative number in Python gives a positive result. But the modulus operation is defined as the smallest nonnegative residue. \n\n        This matches the clockwise distance.\n\n        But wait: what if the ring had an even number of houses and we are going from house 1 to house n (which is the last house) and n is even? \n\n        Example: n=6, from 1 to 6: (6-1)%6=5 -> which is 5 steps: 1->2->3->4->5->6. Correct.\n\n        From 6 to 1: (1-6)%6 = (-5)%6=1 -> 1 step: 6->1. Correct.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation is defined for any integer. The modulus n operation for negative numbers is well-defined.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation in Python for a negative number a is defined as: \n            a % n = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n        For a=-5, n=6: floor(-5/6) = floor(-0.833) = -1, so a % n = -5 - 6*(-1) = -5+6=1.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints say n and m can be up to 10^5. The modulus operation is O(1), so the whole loop is O(m).\n\n        Let me run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> output 6.\n        Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> output 2.\n\n        But wait, the example input is given as two strings in a list? Actually, the problem says:\n\n          Input: \n            ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n          This is probably a representation of two test cases. However, the problem reads from stdin.\n\n        We assume the input is read from standard input.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n          data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n          if not data: \n             # no input\n          else:\n             n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n             tasks = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n\n        However, the problem says the second line contains m integers. \n\n        We can simply:\n\n          import sys\n\n          data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n          # But the first line has two integers, the second line has m integers.\n\n          Actually, the input format is:\n\n            First line: n and m\n            Second line: m integers\n\n          We can read the first line and then the second line.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        Since the problem doesn't specify that the input might have more than two lines, and we know there are two lines, this is safe.\n\n        Final code:\n\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          current = 1\n          total = 0\n          for t in tasks:\n              d = (t - current) % n\n              total += d\n              current = t\n          print(total)\n\n        But wait, wait: is the modulus operation always giving the clockwise distance? \n\n        Consider: if we are at current and want to go to t, the clockwise distance is the smallest nonnegative d such that (current + d) mod n = t mod n, but note: the modulus operation for the distance calculation is correct.\n\n        However, there is a nuance: the modulus operation in the distance calculation is based on the numerical values, but the houses are arranged in a circle. The modulus operation naturally accounts for the circularity.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation does not require that we subtract 1 from the house numbers. \n\n        However, wait: what if n=1? The problem states n>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n        However, let me test with n=2, tasks=[2,1]:\n          current=1\n          t=2: (2-1)%2=1 -> total=1, current=2\n          t=1: (1-2)%2= (-1)%2=1 -> total=2, current=1\n\n        Simulation: \n          Start at 1, go to 2: 1->2 (1 step)\n          Then from 2 to 1: 2->1 (1 step) because the ring has two houses: 1->2->1 (but wait, the movement is clockwise: from 2 the next house clockwise is 1 (since after 2 comes 1). So yes, 1 step.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        One more: n=5, tasks=[5,4,3,2,1]\n          current=1\n          t=5: (5-1)%5=4 -> total=4, current=5\n          t=4: (4-5)%5= -1%5=4 -> total=8, current=4\n          t=3: (3-4)%5= -1%5=4 -> total=12, current=3\n          t=2: (2-3)%5= -1%5=4 -> total=16, current=2\n          t=1: (1-2)%5= -1%5=4 -> total=20\n\n        Simulation:\n          Start at 1 -> 5: 1->2->3->4->5 (4 steps)\n          5->4: 5->1->2->3->4 (4 steps) because clockwise from 5: next is 1, then 2, then 3, then 4 -> 4 steps.\n          4->3: 4->5->1->2->3 (4 steps)\n          3->2: 3->4->5->1->2 (4 steps)\n          2->1: 2->3->4->5->1 (4 steps)\n          Total: 4*5 = 20.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can submit.\n\n        However, wait: the problem says that Xenia must complete the tasks in order, and the above simulation does not break the order. \n\n        But note: the problem says that for the i-th task, she needs to be in house a_i and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. The order is fixed.\n\n        Our code processes the tasks in the given order, so it's correct.\n\n        Code:\n\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          current = 1\n          total = 0\n          for t in tasks:\n              d = (t - current) % n\n              total += d\n              current = t\n          print(total)\n\n        However, wait: the modulus operation for (t - current) % n is defined for negative and positive. But note: the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is defined as described.\n\n        But there's a potential issue: the modulus operation in Python for a negative number might be implemented as returning a nonnegative value, which we want. \n\n        But wait, what if the difference is exactly -n? Then (-n) % n = 0. But the maximum negative difference is (1 - n) (if current=n, t=1) then (1-n) % n = (1-n) + n * ceil((n-1)/n)? \n\n        Actually, (1-n) % n: \n            (1-n) % n = 1 - n + n * ((n) // n) ? Let me compute: \n            We know: (a % n) = a - n * floor(a/n)\n\n            a = 1-n, n = n\n            floor((1-n)/n) = floor((1/n - 1)) = floor(-1 + 1/n) = -1 (since 1/n is between 0 and 1, so -1 + fraction -> floor is -1)\n\n            Then (1-n) % n = (1-n) - n*(-1) = 1-n+n = 1.\n\n        But wait, we did (1-n) % n for n=4: 1-4 = -3, then -3 %4=1, which is correct.\n\n        However, if we do (1-n) % n for n=5: 1-5=-4, then (-4)%5: \n            floor(-4/5) = -1, so (-4)%5 = -4 -5*(-1) = -4+5=1.\n\n        In general, (t - current) % n = (t - current + n) % n if we want to avoid negative? But the modulus operation already handles negative.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But wait, the modulus operation in Python for negative numbers is well-defined and we are using the built-in modulus, so it's safe.\n\n        Let me run the code for the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n          Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n          n=4, m=3, tasks=[3,2,3]\n          current=1\n          t=3: (3-1)%4 = 2 -> total=2, current=3\n          t=2: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4=3 -> total=5, current=2\n          t=3: (3-2)%4=1 -> total=6 -> output 6.\n\n        Example 2:\n          Input: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\"\n\n          n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3]\n          current=1\n          t=2: (2-1)%4=1 -> total=1, current=2\n          t=3: (3-2)%4=1 -> total=2, current=3\n          t=3: (3-3)%4=0 -> total=2 -> output 2.\n\n        Therefore, we output",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad. The ringroad consists of `n` houses arranged in a clockwise order, and Xenia starts at house 1. Each task requires her to be in a specific house, and she must complete tasks in the given order. The movement between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia moves only clockwise along the ringroad. The key observation is that the time taken to move from one house to another depends on their positions. If the target house is ahead of the current house in the clockwise direction, the distance is simply the difference between their positions. If the target house is behind, the distance is calculated by moving from the current house to the end of the ringroad and then continuing from the start to the target house.\n2. **Insight**: The clockwise distance from house `current` to house `target` can be computed using modulo arithmetic. Specifically, the distance is `(target - current) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This formula accounts for both scenarios: when `target` is ahead of `current` and when it is behind.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each task, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the task's house using the modulo operation. Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, making it linear in time complexity, O(m), where `m` is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for t in tasks:\n        d = (t - current) % n\n        total_time += d\n        current = t\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first two values are `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks). The subsequent values are the task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 (`current = 1`) and initialize `total_time` to 0.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location `t`:\n   - **Distance Calculation**: Compute the clockwise distance from `current` to `t` using `(t - current) % n`. This handles both cases where `t` is ahead or behind `current`.\n   - **Update Total Time**: Add the computed distance to `total_time`.\n   - **Update Current Position**: Set `current` to `t` for the next iteration.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total time taken.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
