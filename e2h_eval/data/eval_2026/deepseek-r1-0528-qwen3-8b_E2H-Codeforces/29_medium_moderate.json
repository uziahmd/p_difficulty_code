Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to process the queries in reverse order because the later replacements might affect the earlier ones (e.g., if a digit is replaced by a string that contains digits to be replaced again). However, note that the problem says: \"the queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed\". \n\n But note: if we do the replacements from left to right, then replacing '2' with '00' and then '3' with '' in the example, we get the correct result. However, consider if a replacement produces a digit that is then replaced by a subsequent query? Actually, the problem says: \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\", meaning that each query replaces every occurrence of the digit.\n\n However, the catch is that the same digit might appear multiple times and we have multiple queries. But note: the queries are given in the order of application. So if we have two queries:\n   Query1: 2 -> 00\n   Query2: 0 -> 5\n\n Then in the first query, we replace every '2' by '00'. Then in the second query, we replace every '0' by '5'. So the two-digit string '00' becomes '55'. \n\n But if we process the queries in reverse order (from last to first) we can use dynamic programming or memoization to update the value of each digit as we go backwards.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of the entire transformation as: each digit in the original string will be transformed by a series of rules until no more rules apply. However, the problem states that the total length of all ti's is <= 10^5, so we can use a graph-like structure for the transformations.\n\n Steps:\n\n Idea 1: Process the queries in reverse order and update a mapping for each digit (0-9) to what it should become at the end. But note: the queries are applied in the given order, so the last query is the one that is applied last.\n\n However, consider: \n   Start with string s.\n   Then apply query1, then query2, ... then queryn.\n\n We can represent the transformation as: \n   Each digit d can be mapped to a string (which may contain digits that are subject to further transformation). But the problem is that the same digit might be replaced multiple times.\n\n We can use a recursive approach for each digit, but the string length might be very long and we have up to 10^5 queries and total replacement string length 10^5, so we cannot expand the entire string.\n\n Instead, we can precompute for each digit (0-9) the final string it represents after all the queries. But note: the queries are applied sequentially, and the same digit might appear in different queries.\n\n However, observe: the queries are applied in order. We can process the queries from last to first and for each digit, update its replacement string by applying the subsequent queries (which we have already processed) to the replacement string.\n\n But note: the replacement string may contain multiple digits, and each digit in that string might be subject to the remaining queries (the ones we haven't processed yet, but since we are going backwards, we will have processed the later ones). \n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let mapping[d] = the string that the digit d is replaced to by the entire set of queries (from first to last). But wait, the queries are sequential and each query uses the current string. \n\n Alternative idea (using DP):\n\n   We want to know, for each digit d, what is the final string that d becomes after processing all queries. Then we can compute the entire number from the initial string by replacing each digit by its final string.\n\n   However, the queries are applied in sequence, and the transformation of a digit d in an early query might be a string that contains digits that are then transformed by later queries.\n\n   We can define an array `trans` for digits 0-9, initially `trans[d] = d` (a string of one character).\n\n   Then, we process the queries from last to first. For each query (d_i -> t_i), we update `trans[d_i]` to be the concatenation of `trans[x]` for each digit x in the string t_i.\n\n   Why? Because when we apply the query d_i -> t_i, then in the next (earlier) queries, each digit in t_i will be transformed according to the rules that were applied after this one. But since we process from last to first, we have already computed the transformations for the digits in t_i (because they are later queries). \n\n   Example: \n        Input: \n            s = \"22\"\n            queries: \n                2->00\n                0->5\n\n        We process the second query first (from last): \n            For digit '0', currently we set trans['0'] = '5' (from the second query). Then we process the first query: \n            For digit '2', we set trans['2'] = trans['0'] + trans['0'] = \"55\"\n\n        Then we can replace the original string \"22\" by \"55\".\n\n   But wait: the example input provided in the problem has multiple examples. Let's check the third sample:\n\n        Input: \n            \"222\"\n            n=2\n            queries: \n                \"2->0\"\n                \"0->7\"\n\n        According to the problem, after the first query: \"222\" becomes \"000\", then the second query: \"000\" becomes \"777\".\n\n        Using our method: \n            We process the last query first: \n                For digit '0': set to '7'\n            Then the first query: \n                For digit '2': set to '0' (from the rule \"2->0\")\n                But note: the rule \"2->0\" is the first query, so the second query (which is last) is applied to the result of the first. However, in our reverse processing, we update the mapping for '0' to '7', then for '2' we set it to the mapping for '0' (which is now '7')? \n\n            Actually, the rule \"2->0\" produces a string \"0\", and then the next rule (applied to the entire string) will turn every '0' into '7'. So the final string for '2' is \"7\".\n\n            Therefore, we should set trans['2'] = trans['0'] (which is \"7\")?\n\n        However, the rule \"2->0\" is given as a string \"0\", which is one character. In our mapping, we have for '0' the string \"7\", so we just use that.\n\n        How do we update? \n\n        For a query (d -> t), we set:\n            trans[d] = ''.join( trans[c] for c in t )\n\n        Then, we can compute the entire string by:\n            result_string = ''.join( trans[c] for c in initial_string )\n\n        But note: the problem does not require us to output the string, but the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n        However, the resulting string can be extremely long (up to 10^5 * (expansion factor) but note the total length of all replacement strings is 10^5, and the initial string is 10^5, but the expansion factor might be high. We cannot build the entire string.\n\n        We need to compute the number modulo 10^9+7 without building the huge string.\n\n        We can use the idea of processing the initial string and for each digit, we know the entire final string representation (as a sequence of digits) and we can compute the contribution of each digit in the initial string.\n\n        However, the mapping for a digit d is a string of digits. We can precompute for each digit d (0-9) two things:\n\n            value[d] = the number represented by the final string for d (if the final string is empty, then 0? but note: the problem says if s is empty then the number is 0)\n            length[d] = the number of digits in the final string for d (modulo something? actually, we need to compute the power of 10 for the position)\n\n        Then, the entire number can be built by:\n\n            Let the initial string be s0, and we break it into digits.\n\n            But the catch: the entire string is built by concatenation. The number is formed by the digits in the final string.\n\n            We can process the final string from the last digit to the first (like a big integer mod 10^9+7) but the string is too long.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming to compute the value and the length (in terms of power of 10) for the entire mapping.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute the transformations for each digit (0-9) from the queries (in reverse order).\n\n            Step 2: Precompute for each digit d (0-9) two arrays (or just two variables per digit) that store:\n\n                    total_value[d] = the number represented by the final string for d, modulo MOD.\n                    total_length[d] = the length of the final string for d (i.e., the number of digits). Note: we need to know the power of 10 for the entire block.\n\n            But note: the entire string is the concatenation of the digits. \n\n            We can also precompute the power of 10 for positions, but we don't know the total length.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n            We can compute the entire number by processing the initial string from left to right, and for each digit we know:\n\n                Let F(d) be the string that d becomes. Then the entire string is the concatenation of F(s[0]), F(s[1]), ... , F(s[-1]).\n\n            We can compute the value of the entire number by breaking it down:\n\n                Let the entire number be broken into segments. Each segment (from a digit d) has:\n\n                    value_seg = total_value[d]\n                    length_seg = total_length[d]\n\n                Then, if we have two consecutive segments, say A and B, then the entire number is:\n\n                    number = A * (10^(length(B))) + B\n\n            So we need to know the length of each segment (in base 10 digits) and the value.\n\n            Then, we can process the initial string from left to right, and combine the segments.\n\n            However, the entire string might be very long (exponentially long in the worst-case? but note: the total length of replacement strings is bounded by 10^5, and the initial string is 10^5, but the expansion factor is controlled by the fact that the replacement strings are given and their total length is 10^5. But note: the same digit might be expanded multiple times, but the total length of all replacement strings is 10^5, so the expansion is limited.\n\n            Actually, the problem says: the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. So the total length of the replacement strings is bounded. However, the expansion of a digit might lead to a string of length L, and then that string is further expanded. But note: the total length of the replacement strings is 10^5, so the entire expansion is bounded by (10^5)^? (but actually, the chain of expansions is limited by the number of queries and the fact that we process the queries in reverse, so we are building the mapping for each digit from the last query backwards).\n\n            But note: the mapping for a digit d is built from the replacement string t_i and the mappings of the digits in t_i. The length of the replacement string for a query is given, and the total length of all replacement strings is 10^5, but the expansion of a single digit might be repeated many times. However, we are storing for each digit the total_value and total_length. \n\n            How to compute total_value and total_length for a digit d?\n\n                Initially, for each digit d, we have:\n                    total_value[d] = int(d)  [but wait, if the final string for d is empty, then we should set total_value[d] = 0 and total_length[d] = 0? Actually, the problem says: if s is empty then the number is 0. But note: the mapping for d might become empty string (if we have a rule that maps d to empty string, and then no rule maps the empty string? Actually, the empty string is just nothing). \n\n                However, the transformation is defined as: \n                    We start with the rule and then recursively apply the rules. But note: the empty string does not contain any digit, so no further transformation.\n\n                So for a digit d, the transformation is a string (possibly empty) of digits. Then:\n\n                    total_length[d] = (the total number of digits in the final string) \n\n                    total_value[d] = the number represented by that final string (if the string is empty, then 0; if the string is non-empty, then we interpret the string as a decimal number, ignoring leading zeros).\n\n                But note: the entire string might have leading zeros, and we are building the number by concatenation. However, the problem says: ignore the leading zeros in the entire number. But note: the entire number is built by the entire string (with the concatenation). \n\n                However, the standard way to compute the number from a string with modulus is to process from left to right, but the modulus arithmetic must account for the entire length.\n\n            Steps for Step 1: Reverse processing of queries.\n\n                Let MOD = 10**9+7\n\n                We'll create two arrays (or dictionaries) for digits 0-9:\n\n                    val[d] = the numeric value of the final string for d modulo MOD.\n                    len[d] = the length of the final string for d (number of digits, i.e., log10 of the value part? but we need the power for shifting)\n\n                However, note: the entire string might have up to (initial string length) * (max expansion factor) digits, but the expansion factor is bounded by the total replacement length (which is 10^5) and the fact that we are processing only 10 digits. \n\n                But wait: the mapping for a digit d is built from the replacement string t_i and the mappings of the digits in t_i.\n\n                We can compute:\n\n                    Let the query be (d -> t). Then the new mapping for d is the concatenation of the mappings for each character in t.\n\n                    Then, the total_value for d is the number formed by the entire final string. \n\n                    We can compute the value by:\n\n                        Let the final string for d be S = S1 S2 ... Sk, where each Si is the final string for the digit c_i (from t).\n\n                        Then, the value is: \n                            value = 0\n                            for each digit string part (each character in t, and then recursively expanded) we know the value and the length (number of digits) of that part.\n\n                        Actually, we can compute:\n\n                            total_value[d] = 0\n                            total_length[d] = 0\n\n                        Then, for each character c in t:\n                            Let v = total_value[c]   (this is the value of the final string for c)\n                            Let l = total_length[c]  (the number of digits)\n\n                            Then, we can append the value v to the total_value[d] as:\n\n                                total_value[d] = (total_value[d] * (10^l) + v) % MOD\n\n                            And update total_length[d] = (total_length[d] + l) % (MOD-1)? \n\n                        But wait: the modulus for the exponentiation? The modulus is 10^9+7, and we are dealing with exponents for base 10. However, the exponents (the length) can be very large (theoretically, but note the total length of the entire string is bounded by 10^5 * (some expansion) but the expansion is bounded by the fact that the total replacement string length is 10^5, and we are processing only 10 digits, but the expansion can be exponential in the number of queries? \n\n                        However, note: the total replacement string length is bounded by 10^5, but the same digit might be expanded many times. But observe: we are storing the total_value and total_length for each digit, and we are updating the digits from the last query to the first. The total_length might become large, but the maximum length is bounded by the total length of the expansion, which is the product of the expansion factors. However, the problem constraints on the total length of the replacement strings (<=10^5) and the fact that we are processing 10 digits, but the expansion might be done repeatedly. \n\n                        Actually, the total_length is the total number of digits in the final string for d. Since the total replacement string length is 10^5, and the initial string is 10^5, but the expansion is defined by the queries, the maximum length might be as large as (initial string length) * (max expansion per digit) but we are storing for each digit independently.\n\n                        However, note: the queries are applied to the entire string, but the mapping for a digit d is independent of the initial string. The mapping for d is fixed after processing all queries.\n\n                        The problem: we are storing the length as an integer. The length might be huge (exponential in the number of queries). But the number of queries is up to 10^5, and the expansion factor for a digit might be multiplied by the length of the replacement string for each query. \n\n                        We cannot store the exact integer for the length if it becomes too big (like 10^5 digits, then the length is 10^5, which is acceptable, but if we have 10^5 queries, and each query doubles the length, then the length would be 2^(10^5) which is way too big to store as an integer).\n\n            We must find an alternative.\n\n        Alternative approach: \n\n            Instead of storing the entire string for each digit, we store the value and the length (in terms of base 10 logarithm) but then we lose the ability to do modular arithmetic for the value.\n\n        Or, we can use the following:\n\n            We want to compute the entire number from the initial string.\n\n            We can process the initial string from left to right, and for each digit d, we know:\n\n                The final string for d is a sequence of digits. We can compute the value and the length (number of digits) of the final string for d, but we don't want to expand the entire string.\n\n            We can precompute for each digit d:\n\n                value[d] = the value of the final string for d, modulo MOD.\n                length[d] = the length of the final string for d (mod ?) but note: to combine two numbers, we need to know the power of 10 to shift the first number by the length of the second.\n\n            However, the modulus for the exponentiation is MOD (10^9+7). But the exponents (the length) can be used modulo (MOD-1) for Fermat's little theorem? But note: we are doing base 10, and 10 and MOD are coprime. So we can use Euler's theorem: \n\n                We want to compute 10^(L) mod MOD, where L is the length (number of digits). But L can be huge (exponential). However, note that the modulus for exponents in modular exponentiation is φ(MOD) = MOD-1 (since MOD is prime). But wait, the exponent L is the length of the string, which is the total number of digits. We are going to use:\n\n                    shift = pow(10, L, MOD)\n\n                But L is the length of the string, and we are going to combine:\n\n                    result = (result * (10^L)) + value\n\n                However, the problem is that L (the length) might be astronomically large. \n\n        But note: the total length of the entire string is bounded by the total replacement string length (10^5) and the initial string (10^5) but the expansion is multiplicative. Actually, the expansion factor is defined by the queries. However, the problem states the total length of all ti's is <=10^5. This is the raw replacement strings. \n\n        However, the expansion of the entire initial string might be very long. But wait: the problem says the sum of lengths of ti for all queries is <=10^5. This means that the replacement strings provided in the queries are short. But the expansion of a single digit might be done multiple times (because the replacement string for one query might contain digits that are replaced by other queries). \n\n        But note: we are processing the queries in reverse order and building the mapping for each digit. The mapping for a digit d is built from the replacement string t_i and the mappings of the digits in t_i. The length of the replacement string t_i is given, and the total length of all t_i is 10^5. \n\n        However, the length of the final string for a digit d is the sum of the lengths of the final strings for each digit in t_i. \n\n        And the length for a digit is the sum of the lengths of the final strings for each digit in the replacement string. \n\n        This is a linear transformation. The maximum length for a digit d is the sum_{c in t_i} (length[c]). \n\n        But the total length of all replacement strings is 10^5, but we are processing 10^5 queries, and the same digit might appear in many queries. \n\n        However, the total length of the final string for a digit d might be very large (exponential growth if the same digit is replaced by a string containing itself). \n\n        Example: \n            Rule: 1 -> 11\n            Then, after two queries (processing in reverse order, but we have to process the last query first) — but wait, we are processing from last to first. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: the queries are applied in the given order. So if we have a self-referential rule, we must process the queries in reverse order and update the mappings. But if a rule appears that refers to a digit that is defined later, then we must update the mapping for the current digit using the latest mapping (which we have already computed because we are processing backwards).\n\n        Example: \n            Query1: 1->2\n            Query2: 2->1\n\n        Processing in reverse order (first Query2, then Query1):\n\n            Start with identity: for each digit d, val[d] = d, len[d]=1.\n\n            Process Query2: 2->1\n                Then, the mapping for '2' becomes the mapping for '1'. But at this time, we have not processed Query1. However, we are processing backwards, so we have already processed the later queries. But Query1 is earlier, so we haven't processed it. \n\n            Correction: We process the queries from last to first. So the last query is Query2, then we process Query1. \n\n            After processing Query2: \n                For digit '2': \n                    t = \"1\"\n                    Then, val[2] = val['1'] (which is 1) and len[2] = len['1'] (which is 1)\n\n            Then process Query1: 1->2\n                For digit '1': \n                    t = \"2\"\n                    Then, val[1] = val['2'] = 1 (from the mapping we just set for '2')\n                    len[1] = len['2'] = 1\n\n            So the mapping for '1' and '2' both become 1 and length 1. \n\n            But the intended transformation: \n                Original string with '1' becomes '2', then the string becomes '2', then the next rule: '2' becomes '1'. So the entire string is transformed to '1'. \n\n            However, if we start with '1', after Query1: becomes \"2\", then after Query2: becomes \"1\". So the final mapping for '1' is \"1\" (if we set the mapping for '1' to the mapping of '2', which is \"1\"). \n\n            But wait, the rule Query1 is applied first: \n                s = \"1\" -> becomes \"2\"\n                then Query2: \"2\" -> becomes \"1\"\n\n            So the final string for '1' is \"1\", and for '2' is \"1\". \n\n            Our method gives: \n                For '1': mapping = \"1\" (value=1, length=1)\n                For '2': mapping = \"1\" (value=1, length=1)\n\n            Then, if we have a string \"1\", we get 1. If we have \"2\", we get 1. \n\n            But what if we have a string \"12\"? \n                Original: \"12\"\n                Query1: replace '1' by \"2\" -> \"22\"\n                Query2: replace '2' by \"1\" -> \"11\"\n\n            With our mapping: \n                We would map '1' to \"1\", and '2' to \"1\", so the entire string \"12\" becomes \"11\", which is correct.\n\n            However, note: the mapping for a digit d is independent of the context. But the transformation is sequential and the same digit might be replaced multiple times. Our reverse processing captures the entire effect.\n\n        But the length (number of digits) is stored as an integer. The problem: the length might be huge (exponential). We cannot store the exact integer.\n\n        However, note: the modulus for the value is 10^9+7. The length (number of digits) is needed to compute the shifting: \n\n            When we have two segments, the first segment has value V1 and length L1, and the second segment has value V2 and length L2, then the combined value is:\n\n                V = V1 * (10 ** L2) + V2\n\n            But 10**L2 mod MOD can be computed if we know L2, but L2 might be huge (like 10^100000). \n\n        We can use modular exponentiation for base 10, but the exponent L2 might be huge. However, we can use Euler's theorem:\n\n            Since 10 and MOD are coprime, we have:\n\n                10^k mod MOD = 10^(k mod φ(MOD)) mod MOD   [if k >= φ(MOD)]\n\n            But φ(MOD) = MOD-1 = 10**9+6.\n\n            However, note: the length L2 is the total number of digits in the final string for a digit. The entire number we are building is the concatenation of these segments. The entire length (in digits) is the sum of the lengths of the segments. But we are only storing the length for each digit. \n\n        But here's the catch: the length (for the purpose of shifting) is the exponent in base 10. We need to compute 10^(L) mod MOD, where L is the length (which is the total number of digits). \n\n        However, the length L might be enormous (like 10^100000) so we cannot compute 10^L mod MOD directly by exponentiation (because the exponent is too big). But we can use Euler's theorem:\n\n            We know that 10^k mod MOD = 10^(k mod (MOD-1)) mod MOD, provided that k >= 0 and gcd(10, MOD)=1.\n\n        BUT: Euler's theorem requires that k and φ(MOD) are such that k >= φ(MOD) for the reduction? Actually, Euler's theorem says:\n\n            If a and n are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n)\n\n            Therefore, a^k ≡ a^(k mod φ(n) + φ(n)) * ...   actually, we reduce the exponent modulo φ(n) but only if k is sufficiently large? \n\n        Actually, we can write:\n\n            k = q * φ(n) + r, with 0<=r<φ(n)\n\n            Then, a^k = (a^φ(n))^q * a^r ≡ 1^q * a^r ≡ a^r (mod n)\n\n        So we can reduce the exponent k modulo φ(n) (MOD-1) for modulus MOD.\n\n        However, note: this holds only if a and n are coprime. 10 and MOD=10**9+7 are coprime.\n\n        So we can compute:\n\n            shift = pow(10, L, MOD)   if we can compute L mod (MOD-1) for the exponent?\n\n        But wait: the exponent L is the length (number of digits) and we need to compute 10^L mod MOD. Then:\n\n            exponent_reduced = L % (MOD-1)\n            Then, 10^L mod MOD = pow(10, exponent_reduced, MOD)\n\n        However, there's a caveat: if L is zero, then 10^0=1. Also, if L is negative, but we don't have negative.\n\n        But note: the length L is the total number of digits, which is a nonnegative integer.\n\n        However, the problem: the length L might be so large that we cannot store it as an integer (like having 10^5 digits, then L is 10^5, which is acceptable, but if we have 10^5 queries, and each query doubles the length, then L could be 2^(10^5) which is way beyond the storage capacity). \n\n        Therefore, we must store the length modulo (MOD-1) for the purpose of exponentiation? \n\n        But note: the shifting operation is defined by the length L (the exponent). We need the value of 10^L mod MOD, and we can compute that if we know L mod (MOD-1) (because of Euler). \n\n        However, we must be cautious: Euler's theorem requires that the base and modulus are coprime, which they are. But the exponentiation is periodic with period φ(MOD)=MOD-1.\n\n        Therefore, we can store for each digit d:\n\n            value[d] = the value of the final string for d modulo MOD.\n            len_phi[d] = the length of the final string for d modulo (MOD-1)   [for the purpose of exponentiation]\n\n        But wait: is that valid? \n\n            We want to compute the entire number from the initial string.\n\n            We process the initial string from left to right. For each digit d_i, we have:\n\n                current_value = (current_value * (10^(len_phi[d_i])) + value[d_i]) % MOD\n\n            However, the shifting factor is 10^(len_phi[d_i]) mod MOD, but wait: the actual length is L, and we are representing L mod (MOD-1) for the exponent. But Euler's theorem tells us that 10^L mod MOD = 10^(L mod (MOD-1)) mod MOD, provided that L >= 0.\n\n        But note: the entire number is the concatenation of the digits. The shifting factor must be 10 raised to the total number of digits in the following part. And that total number of digits is the sum of the lengths of the following parts. \n\n        However, we are storing the length for each digit modulo (MOD-1). But the length of the entire string is the sum of the lengths of the individual digits. Then, when combining two segments, the total length is L1 + L2. Then, the shifting factor for the first segment is 10^(L2) mod MOD. \n\n        But we are storing for each digit d_i the length_phi[d_i] = (the length of the final string for d_i) mod (MOD-1). \n\n        Then, when combining two digits d1 and d2, the length for the two-digit combination is (len_phi[d1] + len_phi[d2]) mod (MOD-1). \n\n        But note: Euler's theorem requires the exponent to be reduced modulo φ(MOD)=MOD-1, but the exponent is the total length (which is the sum of the lengths). \n\n        However, the shifting factor for a segment of length L is 10^L mod MOD, and we can compute it as 10^(L mod (MOD-1)) mod MOD. \n\n        But the entire number is built by:\n\n            result = 0\n            for each digit d in the initial string (from left to right):\n                result = (result * (10^(len_phi[d])) + value[d]) % MOD\n\n        However, we must ensure that the length of the entire string (the total number of digits) is correctly accounted for in the shifting. \n\n        But note: the shifting factor for the current digit d is 10 raised to the total number of digits that come after it (i.e., the entire rest of the string). However, in our processing we are doing left to right, so we need to know the total length of the rest of the string. \n\n        Alternatively, we can process from right to left, but that is not natural.\n\n        Actually, we can precompute the entire mapping for each digit, and then process the initial string from left to right, but we need to know the total length of the entire string (to compute the modulus correctly) but we are storing the length for each digit modulo (MOD-1). \n\n        However, the shifting factor for the current digit is 10 raised to the length of the entire string that comes after the current digit. \n\n        But wait, we are breaking the initial string into digits, and the entire string is the concatenation of the final strings for each digit. \n\n        Let the initial string be s = d0 d1 ... d_{k-1}\n\n        Then the entire number is:\n\n            N = F(d0) * (10^{L1}) + F(d1) * (10^{L2}) + ... + F(d_{k-1})\n\n        where Li = total length (number of digits) of F(d_{i+1}) + ... + F(d_{k-1])\n\n        We can precompute the suffix length and the suffix value? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Let dp_value = 0\n            Let dp_len = 0   (this will be the total length of the entire string from the current position to the end)\n\n            Then, for i from last digit to first:\n                Let d = s[i]\n                Then, the current segment is F(d) (value = value[d], length = len_phi[d])\n                Then, the entire number from this digit to the end is:\n\n                    part_value = value[d] * (10^(dp_len)) + dp_value\n                    part_len = len_phi[d] + dp_len\n\n                Then update: dp_value = part_value, dp_len = part_len\n\n            Then the answer is dp_value.\n\n        But note: we are storing the length of each digit's final string modulo (MOD-1). Then, the total length for the entire string (from the current position) is the sum (mod MOD-1) of the lengths of the digits from the current to the end.\n\n        However, the shifting factor for the current digit d is 10^(dp_len_old) mod MOD, where dp_len_old is the total length of the rest of the string (after d) modulo (MOD-1). \n\n        But wait, we are storing the length for each digit modulo (MOD-1). Then, the total length for the rest of the string is the sum of the lengths (mod MOD-1) of the following digits. \n\n        Then, the shifting factor for the current digit d is:\n\n            shift = pow(10, dp_len_old, MOD)   [but dp_len_old is the length of the rest, stored modulo (MOD-1)] \n\n        However, Euler's theorem says that 10^k mod MOD = 10^(k mod (MOD-1)) mod MOD, so we can use:\n\n            shift = pow(10, dp_len_old, MOD)   # because dp_len_old is already modulo (MOD-1) for the exponent, but wait: we have stored the length for each digit modulo (MOD-1). Then, the total length is the sum of the digits' lengths (each taken modulo (MOD-1)), so we have:\n\n            dp_len_old_total = (len_phi[d_{i+1}] + len_phi[d_{i+2}] + ... ) mod (MOD-1)\n\n            Then, 10^(dp_len_old_total) mod MOD = pow(10, dp_len_old_total, MOD)\n\n        But note: the exponent for the shifting is the total length of the rest of the string, which is the sum of the lengths (each length being the number of digits) of the following segments. \n\n        However, the length of a segment is the length of the final string for the digit. And we are storing that length modulo (MOD-1). \n\n        The issue: the total length (for the shifting) is the sum of the lengths (each length being the number of digits) of the following segments. And we are storing each segment's length modulo (MOD-1). Then, the total length modulo (MOD-1) is the sum of the stored lengths modulo (MOD-1). \n\n        But the shifting factor is 10^(total_length_rest) mod MOD, and we can compute that if we know total_length_rest mod (MOD-1). \n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            MOD = 10**9+7\n            MOD_f = MOD-1   # because φ(MOD)=MOD-1\n\n            Step 1: Read the initial string and the queries.\n\n            Step 2: Create two arrays (or dictionaries) for digits 0-9:\n\n                    val = [0]*10   # val[d]",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing each occurrence of a specific digit with another string of digits. The goal is to compute the resulting number after all transformations and find its remainder when divided by 1,000,000,007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the transformations without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: We process the queries in reverse order. This allows us to determine the final transformation for each digit by considering all subsequent transformations. For example, if a digit `d` is replaced by a string `t` in an early query, any digits in `t` that are subject to later queries must also be transformed accordingly.\n\n2. **Dynamic Mapping**: For each digit (0-9), maintain two pieces of information:\n   - **Value**: The numeric value of the final transformed string for the digit, modulo 1,000,000,007.\n   - **Length**: The number of digits in the final transformed string, modulo 1,000,000,006 (since Euler's theorem requires the modulus for exponents to be one less than the prime modulus).\n\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: To handle large numbers, we use modular exponentiation. The value of a digit's transformed string is computed by combining the values and lengths of its constituent digits, leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic to keep numbers manageable.\n\n4. **Final Computation**: After processing all queries, we compute the final number by processing each digit in the original string from left to right. For each digit, we use its precomputed value and length to update the result, shifting the current result by the appropriate power of 10 (based on the length of the remaining digits) and adding the digit's value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\nMOD_f = MOD - 1\n\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    val = [0] * 10\n    length_arr = [0] * 10\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        val[i] = i\n        length_arr[i] = 1\n    \n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        q = input().strip()\n        queries.append(q)\n        \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        parts = queries[i].split('->')\n        d_char = parts[0]\n        t_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        d_digit = int(d_char)\n        \n        new_val = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        \n        for char in t_str:\n            digit = int(char)\n            new_val = (new_val * pow(10, length_arr[digit], MOD) + val[digit]) % MOD\n            new_len = (new_len + length_arr[digit]) % MOD_f\n        \n        val[d_digit] = new_val\n        length_arr[d_digit] = new_len\n\n    result = 0\n    total_length_rest = 0\n    for char in reversed(s):\n        d = int(char)\n        shift_factor = pow(10, total_length_rest, MOD)\n        result = (result * shift_factor + val[d]) % MOD\n        total_length_rest = (total_length_rest + length_arr[d]) % MOD_f\n        \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial setup reads the input string and the number of queries. Each digit (0-9) is initialized to its own value (0-9) and a length of 1.\n\n2. **Query Processing**: Queries are processed in reverse order. For each query, the digit to be replaced (`d_digit`) and its replacement string (`t_str`) are extracted. The value and length for `d_digit` are updated by combining the values and lengths of each digit in `t_str`, using modular arithmetic to keep numbers within bounds.\n\n3. **Result Computation**: The original string is processed from right to left. For each digit, the current result is shifted left by the length of the remaining digits (using modular exponentiation) and the digit's value is added. The total length of the remaining digits is tracked modulo 1,000,000,006 to ensure efficient computation.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially exponential growth of the string by leveraging dynamic mappings and modular arithmetic, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
