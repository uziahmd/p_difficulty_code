A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. They have k bottles -> total drink = k * l milliliters.\n For a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. But note: the toasts are for the entire group? Actually, the problem says:\n \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. But they want to make toasts such that each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. But when making toasts, if there are n friends and we make t toasts per friend, then total drink needed is n * t * nl.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   Total drink available: k * l\n   Each toast requires nl milliliters (for one friend's one toast). But note: one toast is for one friend? Actually, the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n However, the example: \n   Input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n   Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (if we consider that each toast uses 3 ml, because 3 friends each need 3 ml for one toast? Actually, wait: \n\n Let me read again: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. So for one toast, one friend uses nl ml. Then for t toasts per friend, one friend uses t * nl ml.\n\n But note: the entire group will have n friends, so the total drink required for t toasts per friend is n * t * nl.\n\n Similarly, for limes: \n   They have c limes, each cut into d slices -> total slices = c * d.\n   Each toast requires one slice.\n\n And for salt:\n   They have p grams, and each toast requires np grams.\n\n Therefore, the limiting factors are:\n\n 1. Drink: total toasts (for the entire group) cannot exceed (k * l) // (n * nl) ? \n    Actually, no. Because one toast for one friend requires nl ml. But note: we are making toasts for each friend. So if each friend makes t toasts, then the total drink used is n * t * nl.\n\n But wait, the example does it differently:\n\n Example: \n   n=3, k=4, l=5 -> total drink = 20 ml.\n   Each toast (for one friend) requires 3 ml (nl=3). So one toast (by one friend) uses 3 ml.\n\n   How many toasts can be made in total? \n        Total toasts (across all friends) = min( \n            (total_drink) // (nl),   # because each toast uses nl ml (if we consider each toast as being for one friend)\n            (total_slices),          # each toast requires one slice\n            (total_salt) // (np)     # each toast requires np grams\n        )\n\n   Then, since the toasts must be distributed equally among the n friends, the number of toasts per friend is total_toasts // n?\n\n However, note: the example says: \n        drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (so they are considering the drink per toast as 3 ml, and 20 ml gives 6 toasts because 6*3=18 <=20, but 7*3=21>20).\n\n   Then they say: the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n Why divide by 3? Because 6 toasts total (across all friends) for 3 friends means each friend gets 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\n But wait: what if the total toasts is not divisible by n? Then we take the floor.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Calculate total_drink = k * l\n 2. Calculate total_slices = c * d\n 3. Calculate total_salt = p   [already in grams]\n\n 4. Now, for the drink: the total number of toasts (if only limited by drink) is total_drink // nl\n    But note: one toast uses nl ml. However, the example uses nl per toast (for one friend). But wait, the example says: \n        \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters, it is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts.\"\n\n    This implies that one toast (any toast) requires nl milliliters. But note",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, and then distribute these toasts equally among all friends.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating how many toasts can be made based on three resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of each resource. The challenge is to find the maximum number of toasts that can be made such that all friends consume the same amount.\n2. **Key Insight**: The number of toasts each friend can make is constrained by the most limited resource. We first compute the total available units for each resource (drink, lime slices, salt). Then, we determine how many toasts can be made with each resource, considering the requirement per toast. The smallest of these values gives the total number of toasts possible. Finally, we divide this number by the number of friends to ensure equal distribution.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves straightforward arithmetic operations: multiplication to find total resources, division to find the number of toasts per resource, and then taking the minimum of these values to determine the limiting resource. The result is then divided by the number of friends to get the toasts per friend.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_slices = c * d\n    \n    toasts_by_drink = total_drink // nl\n    toasts_by_limes = total_slices\n    toasts_by_salt = p // np\n    \n    total_possible_toasts = min(toasts_by_drink, toasts_by_limes, toasts_by_salt)\n    \n    per_friend = total_possible_toasts // n\n    \n    print(per_friend)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast for drink, and grams per toast for salt.\n2. **Calculating Total Resources**: \n   - **Total Drink**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Multiply the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n3. **Determining Toasts per Resource**:\n   - **Drink-Limited Toasts**: Divide the total drink by the drink requirement per toast.\n   - **Lime-Limited Toasts**: The total number of lime slices available.\n   - **Salt-Limited Toasts**: Divide the total salt by the salt requirement per toast.\n4. **Finding the Limiting Factor**: The smallest value among the three calculated toasts determines the maximum number of toasts that can be made.\n5. **Equal Distribution**: Divide the total possible toasts by the number of friends to ensure each friend gets an equal number of toasts, using integer division to handle any remainder.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures fair distribution among friends, providing the correct answer in optimal time.",
