For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'] (12 notes)\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing the semitone index.\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we will consider all permutations (there are only 6) and check the conditions for major and minor.\n\n Conditions:\n For major: There exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n   distance(x, y) = 4 semitones\n   distance(y, z) = 3 semitones\n\n For minor: There exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n   distance(x, y) = 3 semitones\n   distance(y, z) = 4 semitones\n\n Note: The distance from note a to note b (in the cyclic 12-tone system) can be calculated as:\n   Let a_index and b_index be the indices (0-11). Then the forward distance is (b_index - a_index) % 12, but we want the smallest positive distance? \n However, note the problem: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" (since going up from E to F to F# to G to G# to A to B to C is 8 steps). \n But wait: the problem says \"distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we don't wrap around? Actually, note the example: \n   Input \"C E G\": C is 0, E is 4 -> 4 semitones. \n   Then E to G: E(4) to G(7) -> 3 semitones.\n\n However, the problem also states: \"between E and C is 8 semitones\". This implies that when going from E to C, we are going upward (because E is lower than C in the next octave?) but wait: \n The musical scale is cyclic. The problem says: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\" \n So the distance from E to C (without wrapping) would be negative? But they say the distance is from the lowest to the highest. \n\n Clarification: The problem does not specify the direction. But note: \n   In music, a chord is defined by intervals in the scale. We have to consider the cyclic nature.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n So if we have two notes, we can map them to two points on a circle. The distance from a to b is the smallest nonnegative angle (in semitones) from a to b in the upward direction? \n But wait, the example: E to C is 8 semitones. If we have E at index 4, then the next C is at index 12 (which is 0). The distance from E to the next C (without wrapping) is (0 - 4) mod 12, but that gives negative. \n\n Actually, we should consider the circular distance without the modulus that wraps the other way. The problem states: \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we are moving upward until we hit the note. \n\n How to compute the distance from note a to note b (in semitones) going upward?\n   Let a_index and b_index be the indices (0-11). Then the upward distance from a to b is (b_index - a_index) % 12, but if negative we add 12 and then take modulo 12? Actually, we don't need modulo for negative because we are only considering the upward direction.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". \n   E is at 4, C is at 0. To go from E to C without wrapping (if we consider the next octave) we have to go from 4 to 12 (which is 8 semitones) and then 12 is equivalent to 0. \n\n So the distance from a to b (if a < b) is (b - a). But if a > b, then we do (12 - a + b).\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the distance from a to b as: (b - a) % 12, but then if negative, we add 12. Then take modulo 12? Actually, we just want the positive distance that is <= 11.\n\n But note: the problem says \"from the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: Convert each note in the input to a numerical value representing its position in the 12-note musical scale (e.g., C=0, C#=1, ..., B=11).\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation of the three notes, compute the distances between consecutive notes in the cyclic scale. The distance from note A to note B is calculated as `(B - A) % 12`, ensuring it is always positive by adjusting with modulo arithmetic if necessary.\n3. **Chord Classification**: Check if any permutation of the notes satisfies the conditions for a major chord (distances of 4 and 3 semitones) or a minor chord (distances of 3 and 4 semitones). If neither condition is met, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    \n    def note_to_index(note):\n        return notes_list.index(note.strip())\n    \n    input_str = input().split()\n    if len(input_str) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        indices = [note_to_index(note) for note in input_str]\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    if len(set(indices)) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        dist_ab = (b - a) % 12\n        dist_bc = (c - b) % 12\n        dist_ac = (c - a) % 12\n        \n        if dist_ab == 4 and dist_bc == 3:\n            found_major = True\n            \n        if dist_ab == 3 and dist_bc == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The function `note_to_index` converts each note to its corresponding index in the predefined list of 12 notes.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into individual notes. If there are not exactly three distinct notes, the chord is immediately classified as \"strange\".\n3. **Permutations Check**: All permutations of the three notes are generated to explore every possible ordering. For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Chord Conditions**: For each permutation, the code checks if the distances between the notes match the patterns required for a major chord (4 and 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 and 4 semitones). If only one condition is met, the chord is classified accordingly; otherwise, it is marked as \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine their chord type, ensuring accurate classification based on the given musical rules.",
