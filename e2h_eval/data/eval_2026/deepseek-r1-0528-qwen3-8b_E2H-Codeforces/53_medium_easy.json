    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Since the string is short, we can try to consider every substring and check for duplicates.\n However, note: We need the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. If the string length is less than 2, then no duplicate substring of length>=1? Actually, if the string is \"a\", then no duplicate substring of positive length -> output 0.\n 2. We can iterate over all possible substrings and record their lengths and starting indices (or simply store the substring and its length) but that would be O(n^2) in storing.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n Let n = len(s)\n For length L from floor(n/2) down to 1 (but actually we want the maximum L that appears at least twice, so we can start from the maximum possible and go down until we find one that repeats)\n However, note: The problem says \"longest substring\", so we want the maximum L such that there exist two (possibly overlapping) occurrences of substring of length L.\n\n But note: The problem allows overlapping. Example: \"ababa\" -> the substring \"aba\" appears starting at index0 and index2.\n\n We can do:\n  Option 1: Iterate by substring length from n//2 down to 1, and for each length, check if there's a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n Why from high to low? Because we want the maximum length.\n\n However, worst-case: n=100, then the maximum substring length we can have is 50 (because two occurrences must be non-overlapping? Actually, they can overlap, but the entire string might be same character, then we can have multiple occurrences of long substrings? Actually, the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice is at most floor(n/2) if we require non-overlapping? But wait: \n Example: \"aaa\" -> \n   Substring of length 2: \"aa\" appears at index0 and index1 -> so length 2 is valid. But also length 1: \"a\" appears three times. The longest is 2.\n\n However, note: In \"aaa\", the substring \"aa\" appears at index0 and index1. So the answer is 2.\n\n How to check for a fixed length L?\n   We can create a set of all contiguous substrings of length L, and if the set has less than the total number of substrings (which is n - L + 1) then we found one.\n\n But note: the problem says the occurrences can overlap, so we don't require non-overlapping. The set method naturally considers overlapping ones because we take contiguous substrings.\n\n Steps:\n  Read the string s.\n\n  Let n = len(s)\n  If n == 0: print 0\n  Otherwise, we want to find the maximum L (from min(n, ?) down to 1) such that there are at least two distinct starting indices i, j (with |i-j| < L) where s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L].\n\n  But note: We are allowed to have the same substring at two different positions (even with overlapping). The condition is just that the substring of length L appears at least twice.\n\n  We can iterate L from n//2 down to 1 (but actually, we can go from n-1 down to 1, but note: the maximum L for which there are two occurrences must be <= floor(n/2) for non-overlapping? Actually, even if they overlap, the two occurrences must fit in the string. The minimal requirement is that the two occurrences start at indices i and j, and we require i+L <= n and j+L <= n. The two occurrences can start as close as 1 apart (if the substring is the same and the string is long enough). \n\n  However, the maximum L for which a substring can appear twice is when the two occurrences are adjacent (so the substring length must be at most n-1, but actually we can have two occurrences of length L only if n >= 2*L? Not necessarily: because they can overlap. Actually, the condition is that the two occurrences must start at two different indices i and j, and we require that the substring of length L starting at i and the substring of length L starting at j are equal. There's no restriction on the distance between i and j except that the entire substring fits. So we can have two occurrences that are not necessarily covering the whole string.\n\n  But note: the entire string is of length n, so the starting index i can go from 0 to n-L. So the condition for having at least two occurrences is that there are at least two distinct starting indices i and j (0<=i,j<=n-L) such that s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L].\n\n  Since we are going from high L to low L, we can break once we find an L for which the condition holds.\n\n  However, we must consider: the maximum L for which the substring appears at least twice is the answer.\n\n  But note: what if the entire string is the same? Then the substring of length L (for L from 1 to n) appears many times. However, the maximum L is n-1? \n      Example: \"aaa\", n=3. \n        L=2: substrings: \"aa\" (at index0) and \"aa\" (at index1) -> so answer 2.\n        But note: for L=3: only one substring \"aaa\", so no duplicate.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n    for L in range(min(n, some_max), 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            # We don't need to store all, we can break early if we see two same substrings?\n            # But we want to know if there is at least two occurrences.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a set and compare the size.\n\n    However, we are going from high L to low L, so we can break at the first L for which the set of substrings has size < (n - L + 1)\n\n  But note: the set method: we can do:\n\n        unique_substrings = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in unique_substrings:\n                # we found at least two occurrences, but wait: we are building the set and we already saw it, so we break?\n                # Actually, we are trying to find if there is at least two, so if we see a substring that we've seen before, then we have found two.\n                # But we are iterating from high L to low L, so we want the maximum L for which this happens.\n\n        However, we don't need to know exactly two, we just need to know if there is at least two.\n\n  We can do:\n\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            # But wait, the maximum substring length that can appear twice must be at most n-1 (because if L==n, then there is only one substring) so we can start from n-1 down to 1.\n\n        However, the problem says the string length doesn't exceed 100, so we can iterate from 99 down to 1.\n\n  But note: what if the string is \"abcde\", then no duplicate substring, so we output 0.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n      # If the string is empty, output 0. But the problem says non-empty, but still.\n\n      # We'll iterate L from n-1 down to 1 (inclusive) and check for duplicate substring of length L.\n\n      # However, we can optimize: the maximum L for which a duplicate exists must be at most floor((n+1)/2) ??? Actually, no: in \"aaa\", n=3, maximum L=2 which is greater than floor((3+1)/2)=2. But wait, 2 is the maximum.\n\n      Actually, the condition for duplicate is that the substring of length L appears at least twice. There is no theoretical upper bound other than L <= n-1 (because if L==n, only one occurrence). So we can iterate from n-1 down to 1.\n\n      But note: if we find a duplicate for a given L, we output L and break.\n\n      However, what if we don't find any? Then we output 0.\n\n      But wait: the problem says \"at least twice\". So if we don't find a duplicate for any L, then the answer is 0.\n\n      However, consider: could there be two occurrences of a substring of length 0? The problem states non-empty string, but the substring must be contiguous. The problem doesn't specify that the substring must be non-empty? But the example outputs 0 for ['abcd'].\n\n      According to the problem: the input is non-empty, but the substring must be at least of length 1 to be considered? Actually, the problem says \"longest substring\", and if no substring of positive length appears at least twice, then the answer is 0.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            # We'll use a dictionary or set to record the substrings we've seen.\n            seen = set()\n            found_duplicate = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    # We found a duplicate for length L, so we break out and output L.\n                    found_duplicate = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found_duplicate:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n\n        # If we didn't find any duplicate for any L from n-1 down to 1, then output 0.\n\n      However, wait: what if a substring of length L appears more than twice? We break as soon as we see two, which is correct.\n\n      But note: the above inner loop breaks as soon as we see a duplicate. But we are iterating from the largest L (n-1) downward, so the first duplicate we find is the longest.\n\n      Example: \"ababa\"\n        n=5, so we check L=4: substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate -> move to L=3.\n        L=3: substrings: \n            \"aba\" -> new\n            \"bab\" -> new\n            \"aba\" -> duplicate (already seen \"aba\")\n        So we output 3.\n\n      Example: \"zzz\"\n        n=3, check L=2: substrings: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> duplicate, so output 2.\n\n      Example: \"abcd\"\n        n=4, check L=3: substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=2: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> no duplicate.\n        L=1: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicate -> output 0.\n\n      This matches the sample.\n\n  However, note: we are breaking as soon as we find one duplicate. But what if for a given L, the same substring appears more than twice? We break at the second occurrence, which is correct.\n\n  But note: the set we are using in the inner loop: we are storing all substrings of length L. However, we don't need to store all if we break early. But the problem says the string length is at most 100, so the maximum number of substrings for a given L is 100, which is acceptable.\n\n  But we can break early as soon as we find a duplicate.\n\n  However, the above algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst-case (if no duplicate, we check all substrings for all L). But n is at most 100, so worst-case we check about 100*100/2 = 5000 substrings, which is acceptable.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a dictionary for each L, but the above is fine.\n\n  But wait: we are iterating from L = n-1 down to 1. The worst-case is when there are no duplicates, then we iterate for L from n-1 to 1, and for each L we iterate over (n - L + 1) substrings. The total number of substrings we consider is sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n - L + 1) = n*(n+1)/2 - (n*(n-1))/2? Actually, the total number of substrings is n*(n+1)//2, which for n=100 is 5050, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, we can optimize by noticing that if a substring of length L appears at least twice, then a substring of length L-1 (any occurrence) must appear in both, but that's not necessarily the case (because the two occurrences might be shifted). But we are going from high to low, so we break at the first duplicate.\n\n  But worst-case (no duplicate) we have to check all substrings. 5050 is acceptable for n=100.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the problem input is given as a list of strings? The example input format is:\n\n      Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n  But the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n  So we read one string.\n\n  Code:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      n = len(s)\n      # If the string is empty, output 0.\n      if n == 0:\n          print(0)\n          exit(0)\n\n      # We'll iterate L from n-1 down to 1.\n      for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          duplicate_found = False\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  duplicate_found = True\n                  break\n              else:\n                  seen.add(substr)\n\n          if duplicate_found:\n              print(L)\n              exit(0)\n\n      # If we get here, no duplicate found for any L>=1.\n      print(0)\n\n  But wait: what if the string is \"aaa\"? \n      n=3, then L from 2 down to 1.\n        L=2: \n            i=0: substr=\"aa\", not seen -> add to set.\n            i=1: substr=\"aa\", found in set -> duplicate_found=True, print 2.\n\n  Correct.\n\n  However, note: the example input format is given as a list, but the problem says \"The first input line contains the string.\" meaning one string per test case. But the example input is shown as a list of three strings. The problem says \"Input\" and then the example input is ['abcd','ababa','zzz'].\n\n  But wait, the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" meaning one string. However, the example input is given as a list. This might be because the example shows multiple test cases? But the problem says \"You're given a string\", singular.\n\n  Let me check the problem statement: \"The first input line contains the string.\" and the example input is shown as a list. But note: the example output is also a list.\n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\" and \"Output: ['0','3','2']\"\n\n  This suggests that the input might be multiple test cases. But the problem statement says \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular). \n\n  However, looking at the sample tests, there are three examples. But the problem says \"Your task is to solve the problem above\", meaning one string per run.\n\n  But the example input format is ambiguous. The problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the input.\n\n  Clarification: The problem likely expects one string per run, but the example input is given as a list of three strings. This is common in problems that have sample tests. \n\n  Since the problem says \"The first input line contains the string\", we assume one string.\n\n  However, if the competition platform runs multiple test cases, then we must read until EOF? But the problem says the first input line. \n\n  But note: the problem says \"Input\" and then gives the example as a list. To be safe, let's read the entire input as one string.\n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" So we read one line.\n\n  But the example input is shown as a list. This might be a representation of multiple test cases. However, the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n  Since the problem is small and the input is one string, we assume one test case.\n\n  But wait, the example output is a list of three numbers. How should we handle multiple test cases?\n\n  Let me re-read: \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular) and the example input is given as a list. \n\n  After checking the problem statement again: it says \"Input: ['abcd','ababa','zzz']\", which is confusing.\n\n  Actually, the problem statement is written in a way that the example input is provided as a list for clarity. But the actual input will be one string per run.\n\n  So we assume one string per run.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Note that this is an easy question.\"\n\n  But if the competition provides multiple test cases, then we must read until EOF. But the problem does not specify.\n\n  Since the problem says \"The first input line\", and then the example input is a list, I think the intended meaning is that the input consists of one string.\n\n  But the sample input is given as:\n\n      ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n  This implies that the problem might be testing with multiple test cases.\n\n  Let me check the problem statement: \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular) and then the example output is three numbers.\n\n  This is ambiguous. However, typical competitive programming problems might have multiple test cases. But the problem does not say \"multiple test cases\".\n\n  Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the constraints say the string length is at most 100, and the input is non-empty, we can assume one test case.\n\n  But the example input format is shown as a list. \n\n  Another possibility: the problem is designed to read one string from stdin, and the example input is just an illustration.\n\n  Therefore, we write the program to read one string.\n\n  However, if the competition provides multiple test cases, we can adjust by reading until EOF.\n\n  But the problem says: \"The first input line\", meaning one line. \n\n  We'll stick to one string.\n\n  But wait, the example input is given as a list of three strings. That might be because the problem statement is showing the example inputs together. \n\n  I think the intended way is to run the program for each test case separately, or the input is one string.\n\n  Since the problem says \"The first input line\", we read one line.\n\n  Let's run the code with one string.\n\n  However, if the competition uses multiple test cases, we can change the reading to:\n\n      import sys\n      data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n      # Then process each line? But the problem says the first input line.\n\n  But the problem says the first input line. So if there are multiple lines, we only use the first.\n\n  So we'll do:\n\n      s = input().strip()\n\n  and then process.\n\n  But the example input is given as a list. So if we are to test with multiple strings, we cannot. \n\n  Since the problem is ambiguous, and the constraints are small, I'll write the code for one test case.\n\n  If the competition provides multiple test cases, then we can modify to read until EOF.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"The first input line\", so we assume one line.\n\n  But note: the example output is a list of three numbers. This suggests that the problem might be providing multiple test cases.\n\n  After re‐reading the problem statement: it says \"You're given a string.\" (singular) and the example input is shown as a list.\n\n  This is confusing. But note: the problem says \"Input: ['abcd','ababa','zzz']\" and \"Output: ['0','3','2']\".\n\n  This means that the input is three separate test cases? But the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning one line.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might be providing one test case per run, but the example input is showing three examples.\n\n  Since the problem is from a competition, and the sample input is given as a list, it's likely that the actual input is one string per test case and there might be multiple test cases.\n\n  But the problem statement does not specify.\n\n  To be safe, I'll assume that the input is one string per run.\n\n  However, if the competition provides multiple test cases, we can change the input reading to:\n\n      import sys\n      data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n  But the problem says the string is given in the first input line.\n\n  Let me stick to the problem statement: read the first input line.\n\n  But if the competition runs multiple test cases, they would provide multiple lines. \n\n  The problem statement does not specify, but the example input is given as a list. \n\n  Since the problem is small, I can ask for clarification. But since I cannot, I'll write two versions.\n\n  Version 1: assuming one test case per run (one line of input).\n\n  Version 2: assuming multiple test cases until EOF.\n\n  But the problem says \"The first input line\", so if there are multiple test cases, the first line is the first string, then the next line is the second string? \n\n  Actually, the example input is shown as a list of three strings, but without specifying whether they are in separate lines.\n\n  Since the problem says \"The first input line\", I think the intended input is one string per run.\n\n  However, the example input is given as a list. So if we are to test with the example, we can run the program three times with the three strings.\n\n  But the problem statement says \"Input: ['abcd','ababa','zzz']\" and \"Output: ['0','3','2']\".\n\n  This suggests that the input is three separate test cases. \n\n  Therefore, we must read multiple test cases.\n\n  How to read multiple test cases? The problem says the first input line, so if there are multiple test cases, then the first input line is the first string, then the next input line is the second string, etc.\n\n  But the problem does not specify the number of test cases.\n\n  Since the input is from stdin, we can read until EOF.\n\n  Steps for multiple test cases:\n\n      import sys\n\n      data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n      for line in data:\n          s = line.strip()\n          # process s\n\n  But the problem says the first input line, so if there is only one test case, then we use the first line.\n\n  Now, the problem statement is ambiguous. But since the example input is provided as a list, and the output is a list, I think the intended solution is to read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\n  However, the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular) so if there are multiple test cases, then the first input line is the first string, and then the next line is the second string.\n\n  Since the problem is ambiguous, I'll write the code for multiple test cases (until EOF) because the example input is given as a list of three strings.\n\n  But note: the example input is given as:\n\n      ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n  So if we run the program and paste these three strings, we must read them as three separate inputs.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      import sys\n\n      data = sys.stdin.readlines()\n      results = []\n      for line in data:\n          s = line.strip()\n          if s:  # if the line is not empty\n              n = len(s)\n              if n == 0:\n                  results.append(\"0\")\n                  continue\n\n              # Then the same algorithm as above.\n\n      Then output each result on a separate line? But the example output is a list of strings.\n\n  However, the problem says to output one number per test case.\n\n  But the example output is given as ['0','3','2'], meaning three numbers.\n\n  So we can output each result on a separate line.\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"Output: Output one number — length of the longest substring ...\". So for each test case, one number.\n\n  Therefore, if there are multiple test cases, we output each number on a separate line.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might have only one test case. But the example input is three.\n\n  Since the problem statement is ambiguous, I'll write the code for multiple test cases (until EOF) and hope that the competition provides one test case per run (so only one line) or multiple.\n\n  Steps for multiple test cases:\n\n      import sys\n\n      data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n      for line in data:\n          s = line.strip()\n          if not s:\n              continue\n          n = len(s)\n          # Then the algorithm above.\n\n  However, the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to worry about empty string.\n\n  But wait, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty...\"\n\n  So we can skip empty lines.\n\n  Let me code accordingly.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"non-empty\", so we don't expect empty string. However, we read by line, so if the line is empty, skip.\n\n  However, the problem says the first input line, so if there is an empty line, we skip.\n\n  Since the problem says non-empty, we can assume each line is non-empty.\n\n  But to be safe, we skip empty lines.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might not have empty lines.\n\n  We'll proceed.\n\n  However, the problem statement says the string is non-empty, so each line we read is non-empty.\n\n  Code for multiple test cases:\n\n      import sys\n\n      lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip() != '']\n      for s in lines:\n          n = len(s)\n          # If n==0: output 0, but the problem says non-empty, so n>=1.\n          # Then the same algorithm.\n\n  But wait, the problem says the string is non-empty, so n>=1.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      import sys\n\n      for line in sys.stdin:\n          s = line.strip()\n          if s == '':\n              continue\n          n = len(s)\n          # Now apply the algorithm.\n\n  But the algorithm is:\n\n      for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          duplicate_found = False\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  duplicate_found = True\n                  break\n              else:\n                  seen.add(substr)\n          if duplicate_found:\n              print(L)\n              break\n      else:\n          print(0)\n\n  However, we must not break the outer loop for one test case. We break the inner loop and then the outer loop continues to the next test case.\n\n  Actually, the above code breaks the inner loop and then the outer loop continues? No, the break in the inner loop doesn't break the outer loop. But we don't want to break the outer loop, we just want to print the answer for this string and then continue.\n\n  But wait, the above code uses 'break' inside the inner loop, and then after that if duplicate_found is True, we print(L) and then break the outer loop? Actually, no: the break in the inner loop breaks the inner for-loop, then we check duplicate_found and if True, we print(L) and then we break the outer loop? \n\n  Actually, no: the outer loop is controlled by the for-loop. We break the inner loop, then we check the condition and then we break the outer loop? We don't. \n\n  We want to break the outer loop after printing the answer for this string? Actually, no: we are processing one string at a time, and the algorithm for one string is independent.\n\n  The above code breaks the inner loop and then prints the L and then breaks the outer loop? Actually, we break the outer loop by using 'break' after the if duplicate_found, but that breaks the outer for-loop (over L) for this test case.\n\n  But that is correct: we found the answer for this string and we break the L-loop. Then we move to the next test case.\n\n  However, if we don't find any duplicate, we finish the L-loop and then print 0.\n\n  But note: the outer loop is a for-loop, so if we break the inner loop and then break the outer loop, we leave the current test case.\n\n  But if we break the outer loop, we don't process the remaining L values.\n\n  This is correct because we are iterating from high to low and we break at the first duplicate we find (the highest L). Then we output that L and break the outer loop.\n\n  But what if we don't break the outer loop? Then we continue to the next L for the same test case? That would be incorrect because we are looking for the maximum L.\n\n  Actually, the above code breaks the inner loop and then if duplicate_found is True, we break the outer loop (by the break statement) and then move to the next test case.\n\n  But wait, the break statement is inside the outer loop? Actually, the break statement is at the same level as the if duplicate_found, so it breaks the outer for-loop (the one over L).\n\n  This is correct because we found the answer for the current string.\n\n  However, if we don't break the outer loop, we would continue to the next L and then we would output a larger L again? That wouldn't happen because we break the inner loop and then break the outer loop.\n\n  But note: the break in the outer loop is done by the 'break' statement, which breaks the innermost loop (the for-loop over L). \n\n  So the code structure is:\n\n      for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n          ... (inner loop)\n          if duplicate_found:\n              print(L)\n              break   # breaks the outer for-loop\n\n      else:   # this else corresponds to the for-loop, meaning if we didn't break the for-loop\n          print(0)\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  But wait, what if we break the inner loop and duplicate_found is True, then we break the outer loop and skip the else. Then we don't print 0.\n\n  And if we don't break the inner loop (meaning no duplicate for this L) and we finish the inner loop, then we don't break the outer loop and the for-loop continues.\n\n  However, we don't break the outer loop in that case, so we continue to the next L.\n\n  But the else clause of the for-loop is executed only if the loop finishes normally (without break). So we can remove the else and just print(0) after the for-loop.\n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      found = False\n      for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n          seen = set()\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  print(L)\n                  found = True\n                  break   # break inner loop\n              seen.add(substr)\n          if found:\n              break   # break outer loop\n\n      if not found:\n          print(0)\n\n  This is clearer.\n\n  But the above code breaks the inner loop and then breaks the outer loop. Alternatively, we can use a function and return.\n\n  However, the above is acceptable.\n\n  Let me test with \"abcd\": \n      n=4, L from 3 down to 1.\n        L=3: substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate -> inner loop ends without setting found=True, then we don't break the outer loop, so we go to L=2.\n        L=2: substrings: \"ab\",\"bc\",\"cd\" -> no duplicate -> inner loop ends, then we don't break the outer loop, so we go to L=1.\n        L=1: substrings: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicate -> inner loop ends, then we don't break the outer loop, then after the for-loop we print 0.\n\n  Correct.\n\n  Now, we must consider: the problem says the string is non-empty and up to 100 characters, so the above is efficient.\n\n  But note: the worst-case scenario for the inner loop is when L=1, then we have 100 substrings. Then L=2: 99 substrings, etc. So the total operations is the sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1) which is about n*(n+1)/2, which for n=100 is 5050, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, we break early when we find a duplicate for a given L, so in many cases we don't have to check all L.\n\n  Let me write the code accordingly for multiple test cases.\n\n  But wait: the problem statement is ambiguous about the input format. However, the example input is given as a list, so I'll assume the input may have multiple test cases.\n\n  Final code:\n\n      import sys\n\n      for line in sys.stdin:\n          s = line.strip()\n          if s == '':\n              continue\n          n = len(s)\n          # If the string is of length 1, then no duplicate substring of positive length, so we set found=False and then print 0.\n          found = False\n          # We consider L from n-1 down to 1.\n          for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n              seen = set()\n              # We'll traverse all substrings of length L\n              for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                  substr = s[i:i+L]\n                  if substr in seen:\n                      print(L)\n                      found = True\n                      break   # break inner loop\n                  seen.add(substr)\n              if found:\n                  break   # break outer loop\n\n          if not found:\n              print(0)\n\n  However, wait: the example input is a list of three strings. We must output the answers for each string.\n\n  Example: \n      Input: \n          abcd\n          ababa\n          zzz\n\n      Output:\n          0\n          3\n          2\n\n  But the above code reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\n  Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n  Example 1: \"abcd\"\n      Expected: 0\n\n  Example 2: \"ababa\"\n      Expected: 3\n\n  Example 3: \"zzz\"\n      Expected: 2\n\n  The code above produces:\n\n      For \"abcd\": 0 -> correct.\n      For \"ababa\": \n          n=5, L from 4 down to 1.\n          L=4: substrings: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n          L=3: substrings: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> duplicate found, so print 3 -> correct.\n      For \"zzz\":\n          n=3, L from 2 down to 1.\n          L=2: substrings: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> duplicate found, so print 2 -> correct.\n\n  So the code works.\n\n  But note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to handle empty string.\n\n  However, the problem says the string is non-empty, but we read by line and strip, so if the input line is empty, we skip.\n\n  We'll submit this.\n\n  But wait: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't need to worry about empty string.\n\n  One more edge: if the string is \"a\", then n=1, then we iterate L from 0 down to 1? Wait, range(n-1,0,-1): n-1=0, so the range is from 0 to 1 (exclusive of 0?) -> no, range(a,b,c) goes from a to b-1, stepping by c. So for n=1, L from 0 to 1 (exclusive) stepping by -1 -> so the range is empty. Then we don't enter the outer loop and then print 0.\n\n  Correct.\n\n  Another edge: \"aa\": n=2, L from 1 down to 1.\n      L=1: substrings: \"a\", \"a\" -> duplicate found, so print 1.\n\n  But wait: the entire string \"aa\" has two substrings of length 1: \"a\" and \"a\". So the answer is 1.\n\n  However, is there a longer substring? The substring of length 2: \"aa\" appears only once. So the answer is 1.\n\n  Correct.\n\n  But wait, the problem says \"longest substring that can be met at least twice\". In \"aa\", the substring \"a\" (length1) appears twice, and there is no substring of length2 that appears twice. So 1 is correct.\n\n  But note: the substring \"aa\" (length2) appears only once, so we don't consider it.\n\n  However, wait: the substring \"a\" appears twice, and that is the longest? Actually, no: there is no substring of length2 that appears twice. So 1 is the maximum.\n\n  But what if the string is \"aabbaabb\"? \n      This string is \"aabbaabb\", n=8.\n      The substring \"aabb\" appears twice (at index0 and index4). So the answer should be 4.\n\n  Let me test with \"aabbaabb\":\n\n      n=8, L from 7 down to 1.\n\n      L=7: \n          substr",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, and the solution should efficiently handle all edge cases, including strings with no repeating substrings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to determine the maximum length of any substring that occurs at least twice in the input string. The solution involves checking all possible substrings of decreasing lengths from the longest possible down to 1. For each length, we check if there exists at least one substring of that length that appears more than once.\n2. **Intuition**: By starting from the longest possible substring length (which is one less than the string length) and moving downwards, we can efficiently find the first occurrence of a repeating substring, ensuring it is the longest possible. This approach leverages the fact that longer substrings are checked first, optimizing the solution.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over each possible substring length from the maximum down to 1. For each length, it uses a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, the current length is the answer, and the loop terminates early.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3), where n is the string length, due to nested loops (iterating over all possible lengths and all substrings). However, in practice, the solution often exits early when a repeating substring is found, making it more efficient for many cases.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        if s == '':\n            continue\n        n = len(s)\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads input from standard input, processing each line as a separate test case.\n2. **Handling Empty Strings**: Skips empty lines to ensure only valid input strings are processed.\n3. **Iterating Over Substring Lengths**: For each string, the algorithm checks all possible substring lengths from the largest (n-1) down to 1.\n4. **Tracking Seen Substrings**: For each length, it uses a set to keep track of substrings encountered. If a substring is found in the set, it means the substring repeats, and the current length is printed immediately.\n5. **Early Termination**: The loop breaks as soon as the first repeating substring is found, ensuring efficiency.\n6. **Output Result**: If no repeating substring is found after checking all lengths, the program outputs 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination and set operations to track substring occurrences, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
