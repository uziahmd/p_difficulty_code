Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: x + y > z.\n\n Since the sides are constrained by ranges, we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n 1. The constraints on x, y, z are independent in their respective intervals, but the condition x+y>z couples them.\n\n However, note that the ranges are large (up to 500000) so we cannot iterate over all possibilities.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We can fix x and y and then count the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y (but note: since z>=C, we require z from max(C, x+y+1?) wait, no: the condition is x+y>z, so z < x+y.\n\n But note: the condition is non-degenerate triangle: x+y>z, so z must be less than x+y.\n\n However, also note that the triangle condition requires that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third.\n But we have fixed ranges and the conditions on x,y,z:\n\n   x <= y <= z   (because A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D, and note B<=C, so x<=B<=y<=C<=z => x<=y<=z)\n\n Then the triangle condition is automatically satisfied for the other two because:\n   x+z >= x+y (since y<=z) and we know x+y>z, so x+z>y? Actually, we have to check all three conditions.\n\n However, note: when we have x<=y<=z, then the strictest condition is the one with the two smallest sides: x+y>z.\n The other conditions (x+z>y and y+z>x) are automatically satisfied because:\n   x+z >= x+y (since z>=y) and we know x+y>z, but that doesn't directly give x+z>y? Let's see:\n   Actually, if x<=y<=z, then the conditions are:\n      x+y > z   (the critical one)\n      x+z >= x+y > z >= y   -> x+z > y (because x+y>z and z>=y, then x+z >= x+y > z >= y, so x+z > y)\n      Similarly, y+z >= y+x > z >= x, so y+z > x.\n\n Therefore, in this case, the only condition we need is x+y>z.\n\n So the problem reduces to:\n\n Count the number of triples (x, y, z) with:\n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D] and x+y>z.\n\n We can reframe:\n\n   For each x from A to B, and for each y from B to C, we require z < x+y and z>=C and z<=D.\n\n   Then the number of z for given x,y is: \n        count_z = max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)   [if x+y-1 >= C, otherwise 0]\n\n However, iterating over x from A to B and y from B to C would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which can be up to 500000*500000 (250e9) which is too slow.\n\n We need a better approach.\n\n Alternate idea:\n\n Instead, we can fix the side z (or maybe not). Note that the condition is x+y>z, and we know x,y are bounded.\n\n But note: the ranges are large and we cannot iterate over x and y.\n\n We can try to fix z first? But then we need to count pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and also note that y>=B and z>=C, and x<=B, etc.\n\n However, we can use two pointers or precomputation.\n\n Another idea: iterate over y from B to C, and then for each y, consider x from A to B, and then for each (x,y) we know we need z from [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\n But that is still two nested loops.\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute an array F for the range of x (from A to B) and then use prefix sums.\n\n Let's fix y (from B to C) and then consider the condition for x: we require x+y>z, but note that z must be at least C and at most D, and we require x+y>z => x+y>D is not necessary, we only require x+y>z for the maximum z that we consider (which is D) but actually for each z we require x",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the critical condition simplifies to \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all valid triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), with the condition \\(x + y > z\\). Directly iterating over all possible values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) is infeasible due to the large constraints (up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\)).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each fixed \\(y\\), we can determine the range of \\(x\\) values that satisfy \\(x > z - y\\) for all \\(z\\) in \\([C, D]\\). However, since \\(z\\) must be at least \\(C\\), the condition simplifies to \\(x > z - y \\geq C - y\\). But note that \\(x\\) must also be at least \\(A\\) and at most \\(B\\). \n\n3. **Efficient Counting**: Instead of iterating over all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) pairs, we precompute prefix sums for the range of \\(x\\) values. For each \\(y\\), we calculate the minimum \\(x\\) required (denoted as `low`) such that \\(x + y > z\\) for the maximum \\(z\\) (i.e., \\(D\\)). The valid \\(x\\) values for a given \\(y\\) are those in \\([\\max(A, \\text{low} + 1), B]\\). The count of valid \\(x\\) values for each \\(y\\) is then derived using prefix sums to quickly compute the number of \\(x\\) values in the specified range.\n\n4. **Prefix Sum Array**: We precompute a prefix sum array where each entry at index \\(i\\) represents the number of integers from \\(A\\) to \\(i\\). This allows us to compute the count of valid \\(x\\) values for any range in constant time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    n_val = B - A + 1\n    total_x = [0] * (B + 2)\n    for i in range(A, B + 1):\n        total_x[i] = 1\n    for i in range(A + 1, B + 1):\n        total_x[i] += total_x[i - 1]\n        \n    prefix = [0] * (B + 2)\n    for i in range(A, B + 1):\n        prefix[i] = total_x[i]\n        if i > B:\n            break\n            \n    ans = 0\n    for y in range(B, C + 1):\n        low_bound = D - y + 1\n        if low_bound < A:\n            low_bound = A\n        else:\n            low_bound = max(A, low_bound)\n        if low_bound <= B:\n            count_x = prefix[B] - (prefix[low_bound - 1] if low_bound - 1 >= A else 0)\n            ans += count_x\n        else:\n            continue\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n2. **Prefix Sum Array Setup**: We initialize an array `total_x` where each entry at index \\(i\\) (from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\)) is set to 1, indicating the presence of an integer \\(i\\). The prefix sum array `prefix` is then computed to store cumulative counts of integers from \\(A\\) to each index \\(i\\).\n\n3. **Counting Valid Triples**: For each \\(y\\) from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), we determine the minimum \\(x\\) (denoted as `low_bound`) such that \\(x + y > D\\) (the maximum \\(z\\)). The valid \\(x\\) values must lie in the range \\([\\max(A, \\text{low\\_bound}), B]\\). Using the prefix sum array, we quickly count how many \\(x\\) values fall into this range and add this count to the answer.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing all \\(y\\) values, the total count of valid triples \\((x, y, z)\\) is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently reduces the problem to manageable computations using prefix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
