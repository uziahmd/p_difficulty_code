He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that the string only contains 'a','b','c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and note that C appends some number of 'c' (which is either the count of 'a' OR the count of 'b' OR both, but note: the process requires that the original string from A and B has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends c's equal to the current count of 'a' or the current count of 'b' (which includes the original a's and the b's appended by B).\n\n However, note the process:\n   - A gives a string of some number of 'a's (at least one).\n   - B appends some number of 'b's (at least one) -> so the string has a part of only 'a's then only 'b's.\n   - Then C appends some number of 'c's which is equal to the total count of 'a' (from A) OR the total count of 'b' (from B) in the string at that time (which is the entire string after B's appending). But note: the entire string after B has all the 'a's and all the 'b's.\n\n But wait: what if the string we have doesn't have the correct order? The problem states that the string must be such that:\n   - The initial part is only 'a's (from A), then only 'b's (from B), then only 'c's (from C).\n\n However, the example \"bbacc\" is invalid because the order is not correct. So the string must be non-decreasing in the sense that:\n   - All 'a's come first (if any), then all 'b's (if any), then all 'c's (if any).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check the order: the string should be in the form of zero or more 'a's, then zero or more 'b's, then zero or more 'c's.\n    But note: the problem says that there must be at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B). However, C may append zero 'c's? Actually, the problem says C appends some number of letters 'c' (so at least one? or can be zero?) \n\n Let me read the problem again: \n   - A has a string of some number of 'a' (so at least one)\n   - B appends some number of 'b' (so at least one)\n   - Then C appends some number of 'c' equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' (so the number of 'c' is at least one if the count of 'a' or 'b' is at least one). \n\n But wait, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" The string here is the one after B's appending. Since B's appending makes the string have at least one 'a' and one 'b', then the count of 'a' is at least 1 and count of 'b' is at least 1. Therefore, the number of 'c' is either at least 1 (if we choose the count of 'a') or at least 1 (if we choose the count of 'b'). However, note: it is possible that the number of 'c' equals both. So the condition for the number of 'c' is that it must be one of two numbers: count('a') or count('b').\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that the entire string must be split into three contiguous parts. But the process implies:\n   - A's part: only 'a's (so contiguous)\n   - B's part: only 'b's (so contiguous and after A's part)\n   - C's part: only 'c's (so contiguous and after B's part)\n\n Therefore, the string must be split into three contiguous segments: [a's] [b's] [c's].\n\n Conditions for validity:\n   Condition 1: The string must have at least one 'a', at least one 'b', and the number of 'c's must be either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's (or both) and the order must be as above.\n\n But note: what if there are no 'c's? Then the condition for the number of 'c' would be 0, and 0 must equal the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. But the number of 'a' and 'b' are at least 1, so 0 is not equal to them. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'? Not necessarily: wait, the problem says C",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three steps: A provides a string of 'a's, B appends some 'b's, and C appends a number of 'c's equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. The string must also follow a specific order where all 'a's come first, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Order**: The string must be divided into three contiguous segments: one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and then one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like 'b' appearing before 'a' or 'c' appearing before 'b') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the order, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate 'c' Count**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If neither condition is met, the string is invalid.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Check if the string has the correct order: a's, then b's, then c's.\n    a_present = False\n    b_present = False\n    c_present = False\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if not b_present and not c_present:\n                continue\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if not c_present:\n                continue\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        elif char == 'c':\n            c_present = True\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    # Now check the presence of at least one 'a' and one 'b'\n    if not a_present or not b_present:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    n_a = s.count('a')\n    n_b = s.count('b')\n    n_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **String Order Check**: The code first checks if the string adheres to the required order by iterating through each character. It ensures that all 'a's appear before any 'b's, and all 'b's appear before any 'c's. If this order is violated, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Character Presence Check**: The code verifies that there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the string. If either is missing, the string is invalid.\n3. **'c' Count Validation**: The number of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is satisfied, the string is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the string can be constructed according to the specified process.",
