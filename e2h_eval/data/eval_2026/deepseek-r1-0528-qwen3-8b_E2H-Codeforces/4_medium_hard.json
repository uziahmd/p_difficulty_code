The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots (losses) for both players over n rounds.\n The game is played with two cyclic sequences A and B of length m and k respectively.\n\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Idea:\n Let f(i) = (a_i, b_i) for the i-th round, where a_i is from A and b_i from B, and the indices are taken modulo the lengths of A and B.\n\n But note: the sequences are cycled independently. In round j (0-indexed), \n   A_index = j % m\n   B_index = j % k\n\n Then we have a round outcome based on (A[j%m], B[j%k]).\n\n However, n can be very large (up to 2e9) and the total distinct pairs (A[i], B[j]) is at most m*k (<=1e6) but we cannot iterate over n rounds.\n\n Instead, we can break the entire n rounds into cycles that repeat? Actually, the pattern of (i mod m, j mod k) repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds? But note: the two cycles are independent and the combined cycle is LCM(m,k). However, note that n might not be a multiple of LCM(m,k). \n\n But wait: the round index j uses two different moduli. The state (j mod m, j mod k) has a period of LCM(m,k). However, we are only interested in the outcome for each round, and the outcome for a given (a_i, b_j) is fixed.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the outcomes for all pairs (a, b) where a in {'R','S','P'} and b in {'R','S','P'}. We know:\n    - If a == b: draw -> no one gets a spot.\n    - Otherwise:\n        Rock ('R') beats 'Scissors' ('S')\n        'Scissors' beats 'Paper' ('P')\n        'Paper' beats 'Rock' ('R')\n\n    So, if a beats b then the player showing a wins and the one showing b loses (so the one showing b gets a spot).\n    Conversely, if b beats a then the one showing a gets a spot.\n\n    More specifically:\n        a = 'R', b = 'S': R beats S -> so the one with R wins, the one with S loses -> Polycarpus (who has the second sequence) loses? \n        Wait: in the problem, the first player (Nikephoros) uses A, the second (Polycarpus) uses B.\n\n        So, in a round:\n          - If A[i] beats B[j]: then Nikephoros wins and Polycarpus loses (so Polycarpus gets a spot).\n          - If B[j] beats A[i]: then Polycarpus wins and Nikephoros loses (so Nikephoros gets a spot).\n          - If tie: no one gets a spot.\n\n 2. We need to count for each round j (from 0 to n-1) the outcome.\n\n How to do without iterating n (which is up to 2e9)?\n\n We can consider grouping the rounds by the pair (i mod m, j mod k). But note: the index i for A is j mod m, and for B is j mod k. And the round index j goes from 0 to n-1.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the concept of cycles. The entire game can be broken down by the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k, but note: the pattern of (j mod m, j mod k) repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds.\n\n However, note: the state (x, y) where x = j mod m and y = j mod k is determined by j. The next state is (x+1 mod m, y+1 mod k). This is a linear system. The entire cycle of states will repeat after LCM(m,k) rounds.\n\n But note: the mapping from j to (x,y) is such that j increases by 1, then (x,y) increases by (1,1). The set of distinct (x,y) is at most m*k, but we don't need to store all because we can compute the outcome for a given (x,y).\n\n However, the challenge is that n can be very large. We can:\n\n   Let L = LCM(m, k). Then the first L rounds form a cycle, and then we can compute the number of complete cycles and the remainder.\n\n But note: the state (x,y) is uniquely determined by j. The mapping j -> (j mod m, j mod k) is periodic with period L. Therefore, the outcomes for rounds j and j + L are identical.\n\n So:\n\n   Let T = LCM(m, k)\n\n   Then, the total rounds n can be broken as:\n        full_cycles = n // T\n        remainder = n % T\n\n   Then the total red spots for Nikephoros would be: full_cycles * (number of losses for Nikephoros in one cycle) + (number of losses for Nikephoros in the first 'remainder' rounds)\n\n   Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\n But wait: what is the cycle? The cycle is of length T, and the rounds in the cycle are from j=0 to j=T-1. However, note that the state (x,y) for j is (j mod m, j mod k). In the next cycle, j = T, then (T mod m, T mod k) = (0,0) again.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the mapping j -> (j mod m, j mod k) is periodic with period T, and the set of states is exactly the set of pairs (x,y) for which x < m, y < k and there exists j such that j ≡ x (mod m) and j ≡ y (mod k). But by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the condition for existence is that x ≡ y (mod gcd(m,k))? Actually, the mapping j->(j mod m, j mod k) is surjective onto {0,...,m-1} x {0,...,k-1}? Not necessarily. The period is T = LCM(m,k) and in one period, we cover exactly T states. But note: the state (x,y) appears at j = x + t*m (with t chosen appropriately) and then the congruence condition j ≡ y (mod k) must hold. However, the set of j's that satisfy j ≡ x (mod m) and j ≡ y (mod k) is periodic with period T. And for each (x,y) that satisfies x ≡ y (mod g) where g = gcd(m,k), there is a solution modulo T. But actually, the set of states (x,y) that appear is exactly those (x,y) such that x ≡ y (mod g)? \n\n However, note: we are iterating j from 0 to T-1, and since T is the LCM, then for each j in [0, T-1] we get a unique (x,y) and the set of (x,y) is exactly the set of pairs (x,y) such that x runs from 0 to m-1 and y runs from 0 to k-1, but not necessarily all pairs? Actually, the mapping j->(j mod m, j mod k) for j from 0 to T-1 is a bijection between the set {0,1,...,T-1} and the set of pairs (x,y) such that x runs from 0 to m-1 and y runs from 0 to k-1 and x ≡ y (mod g) (where g=gcd(m,k))? \n\n Actually, the set of pairs (x,y) that occur is all pairs (x,y) such that x ≡ y (mod g) (with g=gcd(m,k)) because the equation j ≡ x (mod m) and j ≡ y (mod k) has a solution if and only if x ≡ y (mod g). But note: we are iterating j from 0 to T-1, and the mapping j->(j mod m, j mod k) does not necessarily hit every (x,y) in [0, m-1]x[0,k-1] but only the ones satisfying the above congruence.\n\n However, the problem is that we don't care about the condition for existence, because we are going to simulate the entire cycle of T rounds. But note: T might be very large (m,k up to 1000, so T up to 1000*1000/gcd(1000,1000) = 1000*1000/1000 = 1000, worst-case when m and k are coprime, T = m*k which is 1e6, which is acceptable because m,k <= 1000 so maximum T is 1000000). But 1e6 is acceptable for precomputation? Actually, the constraints say m,k <= 1000, so the maximum T is 1000*1000 = 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n However, note that n can be up to 2e9, but the cycle length T is at most 1e6, so we can break the n rounds into (n // T) full cycles and a remainder of n % T rounds.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, string A, string B.\n\n   Step 2: Compute m = len(A), k = len(B). Also, compute T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n   Step 3: Precompute the outcome for each j in [0, T-1] (each round in the cycle) for the two players.\n\n        For j from 0 to T-1:\n            i = j % m\n            j_index = j % k   # Actually, wait: the second sequence is B, and the index for B is j % k? Yes.\n\n        Then, compare A[i] and B[j_index] to determine who wins and who loses.\n\n        We'll keep two arrays (or just two counters for the entire cycle) for the cycle:\n\n            Let cycle_nike_loss[j] = 1 if in round j (the j-th round in the cycle) Nikephoros loses, else 0.\n            Similarly, cycle_poly_loss[j] = 1 if in round j Polycarpus loses, else 0.\n\n        But note: we are going to sum over the entire cycle.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute:\n\n            total_nike_in_cycle = 0\n            total_poly_in_cycle = 0\n\n            for j in range(T):\n                i = j % m\n                j_idx = j % k\n                a_char = A[i]\n                b_char = B[j_idx]\n\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue   # no loss\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    # Then a_char beats b_char: so Polycarpus (with B) loses -> add to Polycarpus' loss count for this round?\n                    # Actually: \n                    #   If A beats B, then Nikephoros wins and Polycarpus loses -> so Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n                    total_poly_in_cycle += 1\n                else:\n                    # Then b_char beats a_char: so Nikephoros loses -> he gets a red spot.\n                    total_nike_in_cycle += 1\n\n   Step 4: Then, the total for n rounds is:\n\n        full_cycles = n // T\n        remainder = n % T\n\n        total_nike = full_cycles * total_nike_in_cycle + (count of rounds from j=0 to j=remainder-1 where Nikephoros loses)\n        total_poly = full_cycles * total_poly_in_cycle + (count of rounds from j=0 to j=remainder-1 where Polycarpus loses)\n\n   But wait: how to compute the remainder part? We can simply simulate the remainder rounds (from 0 to remainder-1) and count the losses for each.\n\n   However, note: remainder can be up to T-1, and T is at most 1e6, so we can simulate the remainder rounds.\n\n   But note: T is the LCM and the cycle length, and we have already computed the entire cycle. We can precompute two arrays for the cycle (for each j in [0, T-1]) the loss for Nikephoros and the loss for Polycarpus, then for the remainder part we just sum from j=0 to j=remainder-1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute two arrays for the entire cycle:\n\n        nike_losses_cycle = [0]*T\n        poly_losses_cycle = [0]*T\n\n        for j in range(T):\n            i = j % m\n            j_idx = j % k\n            a_char = A[i]\n            b_char = B[j_idx]\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                poly_losses_cycle[j] = 1\n            else:\n                nike_losses_cycle[j] = 1\n\n        Then:\n            total_nike = full_cycles * (sum(nike_losses_cycle)) + sum(nike_losses_cycle[0:remainder])\n            total_poly = full_cycles * (sum(poly_losses_cycle)) + sum(poly_losses_cycle[0:remainder])\n\n   However, note: we have defined the entire cycle and the cycle is from j=0 to j=T-1.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the sequences are cycled independently. The j-th round uses the j-th element of A (cyclically) and the j-th element of B (cyclically). So our indexing is correct.\n\n   However, note: the example input:\n\n        Input: \n          7\n          RPS\n          RSPP\n\n        Output: \n          3 2\n\n   Let's check with the example:\n\n        A = \"RPS\", m=3\n        B = \"RSPP\", k=4\n\n        T = LCM(3,4)=12\n\n        We are going to simulate 7 rounds (n=7). Then:\n\n        full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, remainder=7.\n\n        We need to simulate rounds 0 to 6.\n\n        Round 0: j=0 -> A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw -> no loss.\n        Round 1: j=1 -> A[1]='P', B[1]='S' -> P vs S: P beats S? No, because the rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. So P vs S: S is Scissors and P is Paper -> Scissors beats Paper? No, wait: the rule says \"Scissors beat Paper\", so the outcome: \n            P (Paper) vs S (Scissors): Scissors beats Paper -> so the one with Scissors (Polycarpus) wins, and the one with Paper (Nikephoros) loses. So Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\n        Round 2: j=2 -> A[2]='S', B[2]='P' -> S vs P: Paper beats Scissors? Yes, so the one with Paper (Polycarpus) wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n\n        Round 3: j=3 -> A[3 %3]=A[0]='R', B[3 %4]=B[3]='P' -> R vs P: Paper beats Rock -> Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros loses.\n\n        Round 4: j=4 -> A[1]='P', B[0]='R' -> P vs R: Rock beats Scissors? Wait, no: the rule: Rock beats Scissors, but here we have Paper and Rock. Paper beats Rock -> so Polycarpus (with R) loses? Actually, wait: \n            Paper beats Rock -> so the one with Paper (Nikephoros) wins, and the one with Rock (Polycarpus) loses.\n\n        Round 5: j=5 -> A[2]='S', B[1]='S' -> draw.\n\n        Round 6: j=6 -> A[0]='R', B[2]='P' -> R vs P: Paper beats Rock -> Polycarpus loses? \n            Actually, same as above: Paper beats Rock, so Polycarpus loses.\n\n        Now, let's count:\n\n            Round0: no one\n            Round1: Nikephoros: 1\n            Round2: Nikephoros: 1 (total 2)\n            Round3: Nikephoros: 1 (total 3)\n            Round4: Polycarpus: 1\n            Round5: none\n            Round6: Polycarpus: 1\n\n            So Nikephoros: 3, Polycarpus: 2. Matches.\n\n   But wait: in our code above, we defined:\n\n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            # Then a_char beats b_char: so Polycarpus loses.\n        else:\n            # Then b_char beats a_char: so Nikephoros loses.\n\n   Let's verify with round1: (a_char, b_char) = ('P','S') -> is ('P','S') in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]? \n        ('P','S') is not in that list. So we go to the else branch: then we mark Nikephoros loses. Correct.\n\n   Round2: ('S','P') -> is ('S','P') in the list? Yes, because ('S','P') is the third element? Actually, the list is [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. Yes, so we mark Polycarpus loses. But wait: in round2, we should mark Nikephoros loses. \n\n   There is a mistake: the condition is checking if a_char beats b_char. The list [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] is the set of pairs (a,b) for which a beats b.\n\n   In round2: a_char='S', b_char='P'. According to the rules: Scissors beats Paper. So a_char beats b_char -> so we should mark Polycarpus loses. But wait, in round2, the outcome was: Nikephoros showed 'S' and Polycarpus showed 'P'. So indeed, Nikephoros (with S) beats Polycarpus (with P). Therefore, Polycarpus loses. That matches.\n\n   However, in round1: a_char='P', b_char='S'. The outcome: P vs S. The rule: Scissors beats Paper -> so actually, the one with S (Polycarpus) beats the one with P (Nikephoros). But wait, the condition checks if a_char beats b_char. Here, a_char='P' and b_char='S': does P beat S? According to the rule, no: the rule says Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. So P does not beat S. Therefore, we correctly go to the else branch and mark Nikephoros loses.\n\n   So the condition is correct.\n\n   However, in round3: (a_char, b_char) = ('R','P'): is ('R','P') in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]? No. So we mark the else branch: Nikephoros loses. Correct.\n\n   Round4: ('P','R'): is ('P','R') in the list? Yes, so we mark Polycarpus loses. Correct.\n\n   Round5: ('S','S'): skip.\n\n   Round6: ('R','P'): same as round3, so we mark Nikephoros loses? But wait, in round6: \n        A[6 %3] = A[0] = 'R'\n        B[6 %4] = B[2] = 'P'\n        So ('R','P') is not in the list, so we mark the else branch: Nikephoros loses. But wait, in the example, round6: Polycarpus loses. \n\n   Correction: In round6, we have ('R','P') -> according to the rule: Paper beats Rock, so the one with P (Polycarpus) wins, so Polycarpus doesn't lose? Wait, no: the rule says the one with P (Polycarpus) wins, so the loser is the one with R (Nikephoros). So in round6, Nikephoros loses. But the example says:\n\n        Round6: R - P. Nikephoros loses.\n\n   So the example says: \"R - P. Nikephoros loses.\" -> that means the outcome is that Nikephoros (with R) loses. So that is correct.\n\n   However, wait: the example output says that after 7 rounds, Nikephoros has 3 and Polycarpus has 2. In round6, we are adding a loss for Nikephoros. But in our simulation, round6: \n        j=6: A[0]='R', B[2]='P' -> Polycarpus wins (because P beats R) -> so Nikephoros loses.\n\n   And indeed, we have:\n        Round0: 0\n        Round1: Nikephoros loses -> 1\n        Round2: Polycarpus loses -> 1 (for Polycarpus)\n        Round3: Nikephoros loses -> 2\n        Round4: Polycarpus loses -> 2\n        Round5: 0\n        Round6: Nikephoros loses -> 3\n\n   So the counts for the 7 rounds: \n        Nikephoros: 3\n        Polycarpus: 2\n\n   Therefore, the code for the example is correct.\n\n   But wait: in the example, the sample input was:\n\n        ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n   The second sample input: \n        Input: \n           5\n           RRRRRRRR\n           R\n\n        Output: \n           0 0\n\n   Let's check:\n\n        A = \"RRRRRRRR\" (but we take the first 8 characters, but the sequence is repeated, but we are given the string \"RRRRRRRR\")\n        B = \"R\"\n\n        m = 8, k = 1\n\n        T = LCM(8,1)=8\n\n        We have 5 rounds (n=5)\n\n        For j from 0 to 4:\n\n            j=0: A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw.\n            j=1: A[1]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw.\n            j=2: A[2]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw.\n            j=3: A[3]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw.\n            j=4: A[4]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw.\n\n        So no one loses any round.

This is acceptable because 1e6 is about 10^6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n        However, we can avoid storing the entire arrays by just storing the total for the cycle and then for the remainder part we simulate the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\n        Option 1: Store the entire cycle arrays and then use slicing and built-in sum.\n\n        Option 2: Simulate the remainder rounds (which is at most 1e6) and then use the cycle totals.\n\n        Since T is at most 1e6, and we are going to do:\n\n            total_nike_cycle = 0\n            for j in range(T):\n                ... and then for the remainder we do a loop of remainder.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            total_nike_cycle = 0\n            total_poly_cycle = 0\n            for j in range(T):\n                i = j % m\n                j_idx = j % k\n                a_char = A_str[i]\n                b_char = B_str[j_idx]\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    total_poly_cycle += 1\n                else:\n                    total_nike_cycle += 1\n\n            Then for the remainder part (n % T rounds) we need to simulate the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\n            remainder = n % T\n            nike_rem = 0\n            poly_rem = 0\n            for j in range(remainder):\n                i = j % m\n                j_idx = j % k\n                a_char = A_str[i]\n                b_char = B_str[j_idx]\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    poly_rem += 1\n                else:\n                    nike_rem += 1\n\n            total_nike = full_cycles * total_nike_cycle + nike_rem\n            total_poly = full_cycles * total_poly_cycle + poly_rem\n\n        This is also acceptable because remainder is at most T (1e6) and we are doing one pass of remainder.\n\n        But note: we are already computing the entire cycle (T rounds) and then the remainder (up to T) separately. However, we can combine the two: we can simulate the entire cycle and the remainder in one go, but that's not necessary.\n\n        However, we must note: the entire cycle computation is independent of the remainder. But we are doing two separate loops: one for the entire cycle (T rounds) and then one for the remainder (remainder rounds). The total operations is T + remainder, which is at most 2*T, i.e., 2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n        But wait: what if we want to avoid two passes? We can do one pass for the cycle and then the remainder, but the cycle is defined by the LCM and we must use j from 0 to T-1. The remainder part is the first 'remainder' rounds (0 to remainder-1). We can combine the two by:\n\n            total_nike = 0\n            total_poly = 0\n            for j in range(n):\n                ...\n\n        But n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot do a loop of 2e9.\n\n        Therefore, we break the rounds into full cycles and a remainder.\n\n        But note: the cycle length T is LCM(m,k). The entire game is periodic with period T.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the way we index the sequences is by the round index j. The j-th round uses A[j % m] and B[j % k]. \n\n        The cycle T is the least common multiple of m and k, so the state (j % m, j % k) repeats every T rounds.\n\n        So the two methods are valid.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            A = input().strip()\n            B = input().strip()\n\n            m = len(A)\n            k = len(B)\n\n            # Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n            g = math.gcd(m, k)\n            T = (m * k) // g\n\n            full_cycles = n // T\n            remainder = n % T\n\n            # Precompute the total losses in one cycle for both players.\n            total_nike_cycle = 0\n            total_poly_cycle = 0\n\n            # We'll iterate j from 0 to T-1 to compute the entire cycle.\n            for j in range(T):\n                i = j % m\n                j_idx = j % k\n                a_char = A[i]\n                b_char = B[j_idx]\n\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    total_poly_cycle += 1\n                else:\n                    total_nike_cycle += 1\n\n            # Now, simulate the remainder rounds (from j=0 to j=remainder-1)\n            nike_rem = 0\n            poly_rem = 0\n            for j in range(remainder):\n                i = j % m\n                j_idx = j % k\n                a_char = A[i]\n                b_char = B[j_idx]\n\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    poly_rem += 1\n                else:\n                    nike_rem += 1\n\n            total_nike = full_cycles * total_nike_cycle + nike_rem\n            total_poly = full_cycles * total_poly_cycle + poly_rem\n\n            print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example1: n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        m=3, k=4, T=12\n        full_cycles = 7//12 = 0, remainder=7.\n\n        Cycle simulation (for j=0 to 11) is not needed because full_cycles=0, but we still compute the cycle total (for j=0 to 11) but then the remainder simulation is for j=0 to 6.\n\n        We already did the remainder simulation above and it matched.\n\n   Example2: n=5, A=\"RRRRRRRR\", B=\"R\"\n\n        m=8, k=1, T=8\n        full_cycles = 5//8 = 0, remainder=5.\n\n        In the cycle simulation (j=0 to 7): \n            Each round: (A[j%8]='R', B[j%1]='R') -> draw, so both totals are 0.\n\n        Then remainder simulation (j=0 to 4): same, so both remainders are 0.\n\n        So output: 0 0.\n\n   Another example: n=1, A=\"R\", B=\"S\"\n\n        T = LCM(1,1)=1\n        full_cycles = 1//1=1, remainder=0.\n\n        Cycle simulation: j=0: ('R','S') -> is ('R','S') in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]? Yes, so total_poly_cycle=1, total_nike_cycle=0.\n\n        Then, remainder=0, so no additional.\n\n        Then total_nike = 1*0 + 0 = 0\n        total_poly = 1*1 + 0 = 1.\n\n        But wait, in round0: \n            A[0]='R', B[0]='S' -> R vs S: R beats S? No, because the rule: Rock beats Scissors -> yes, so the one with R (Nikephoros) wins, so the one with S (Polycarpus) loses. Therefore, Polycarpus gets a red spot. Correct.\n\n        However, our condition: \n            Condition: (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ...] -> then we add to total_poly_cycle (Polycarpus loses).

Correct.\n\n   But wait, let me recheck the condition: \n        Condition: if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then a_char beats b_char, so Polycarpus (with b_char) loses.\n\n        So yes.\n\n   However, note: the condition is that a_char beats b_char. In the example, a_char='R' and b_char='S': R beats S -> true.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: We must use math.gcd.\n\n   Edge: m or k could be 0?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) for both players in a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors after playing `n` rounds. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and the challenge is to efficiently compute the result without simulating each round individually due to the large possible value of `n` (up to 2·10^9).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use their own cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each sequence. The goal is to count the total losses (red spots) for both players after `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat cyclically, so the outcomes of rounds repeat every `T` rounds, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one cycle of `T` rounds and then multiplying by the number of full cycles, plus handling the remaining rounds separately.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Compute `T` as the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in one cycle (0 to T-1), determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) based on the current moves from both sequences.\n   - **Loss Counting**: Calculate the total losses for each player in one full cycle. Then, for the remaining rounds (if any), simulate those rounds to count additional losses.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences. The simulation of one cycle involves O(T) operations, where T is at most 1,000,000 (since the sequence lengths are up to 1000). The remaining rounds also require O(remainder) operations, which is manageable since remainder is less than T.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n    \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n\n    total_nike_cycle = 0\n    total_poly_cycle = 0\n\n    for j in range(T):\n        i = j % m\n        j_idx = j % k\n        a_char = A[i]\n        b_char = B[j_idx]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            total_poly_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            total_nike_cycle += 1\n\n    nike_rem = 0\n    poly_rem = 0\n\n    for j in range(remainder):\n        i = j % m\n        j_idx = j % k\n        a_char = A[i]\n        b_char = B[j_idx]\n\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            poly_rem += 1\n        else:\n            nike_rem += 1\n\n    total_nike = full_cycles * total_nike_cycle + nike_rem\n    total_poly = full_cycles * total_poly_cycle + poly_rem\n\n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths `m` and `k` is computed to determine the cycle length `T`.\n3. **Full Cycles Processing**: For each full cycle of `T` rounds, the code counts how many times each player loses by comparing the current moves from both sequences.\n4. **Remaining Rounds Handling**: The remaining rounds (after processing full cycles) are simulated to count any additional losses.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The total losses for each player are computed by multiplying the losses per cycle by the number of full cycles and adding the losses from the remaining rounds.\n6. **Output**: The final counts of red spots for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large input size by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
