    "thought": "\n Okay, we know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n\n The function for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n However, the problem asks: for a given m (number of trailing zeros), how many positive integers n have the property that n! has exactly m trailing zeros?\n\n Note: The factorial function is increasing. The number of trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases.\n\n Observation:\n   Let f(n) = number of trailing zeros in n!.\n   Then, for a fixed m, we are looking for all n such that f(n) = m.\n\n But note: the function f(n) is not strictly increasing. For example, \n   f(4) = 0, f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, f(10)=2.\n\n Therefore, the set of n for which f(n)=m might be a contiguous range (if it exists) or empty.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then, we can check the numbers from that n until the function f(n) becomes m+1.\n\n However, note: m can be up to 100000, so we cannot iterate over n from 1 to a very large number.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We can use binary search to find:\n     L = smallest n such that f(n) >= m\n     R = smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1\n\n   Then, the numbers n for which f(n)=m are the numbers from L to R-1.\n\n   But note: It is possible that there is no n with exactly m trailing zeros? Actually, the trailing zeros increase by more than one sometimes (e.g., when we cross a power of 5). However, the problem says m>=1 and <=100000.\n\n   Also note: the trailing zeros are non-decreasing. So for each m, the set of n satisfying f(n)=m is either empty or an interval [L, R-1] (if R is the next jump).\n\n   However, note the example: m=1 -> n from 5 to 9.\n\n   But wait: what about m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't have to worry about m=0.\n\n   But what if there is no n such that f(n)=m? Actually, for every m there is at least one n? \n\n   Consider: the sequence of trailing zeros: \n        n: 1,2,3,...,4 -> 0\n        n: 5,...,9 -> 1\n        n:10,...,14 -> 2\n        n:15,...,19 -> 2\n        n:20,...,24 -> 4? Actually, wait:\n\n        Actually, let's compute:\n\n        f(0)=0, f(1)=0, ... f(4)=0, f(5)=1, f(6)=1, ... f(9)=1, f(10)=2, f(11)=2, ... f(14)=2, f(15)=3, f(16)=3, ... f(19)=3, f(20)=4, etc.\n\n        So the trailing zeros jump by more than one sometimes. For example, from 19! (which has 3 zeros) to 20! (which has 4 zeros). But then from 20! to 24! still has 4 zeros, and then 25! jumps to 6 zeros.\n\n        Therefore, there might be gaps: for example, is there an n such that f(n)=5? \n\n        Actually, let me check:\n\n        We know:\n          f(20)=4\n          f(21)=4 (because 21/5=4, 21/25=0 -> total 4)\n          f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4\n          f(25)=6 (because 25//5=5, 25//25=1 -> 5+1=6)\n\n        So between 24 and 25, the zeros jump from 4 to 6. Therefore, there is no n such that f(n)=5.\n\n        Similarly, we might have gaps for other m.\n\n        Therefore, the answer for some m might be an empty set.\n\n        Example: Input m=5 -> output 0.\n\n 2. How to compute f(n) (the trailing zeros in n!)? We can do:\n\n        def trailing_zeros(n):\n            count = 0\n            divisor = 5\n            while divisor <= n:\n                count += n // divisor\n                divisor *= 5\n\n 3. Then we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Find the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m. (lower_bound for m)\n        Step 2: Find the smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1. (lower_bound for m+1)\n\n        Then, the numbers n for which trailing_zeros(n)==m are the numbers from the first found n (from step1) to the second found n minus one (from step2).\n\n        However, note: if we found step1 returns a value n0 such that trailing_zeros(n0) >= m, but it might be that trailing_zeros(n0) is already > m? Actually, our method of lower_bound for m is the minimal n0 with trailing_zeros(n0) >= m.\n\n        Then, the condition for having trailing_zeros(n)==m is that n must be in [n0, n1-1] where n1 is the minimal n with trailing_zeros(n)>=m+1.\n\n        But what if there is no n with trailing_zeros(n)==m? Then the set [n0, n1-1] would be empty? Actually, if m is skipped (like m=5), then n0 (for m) is the same as n1 (for m+1) because the next jump is from 4 to 6, so the lower_bound for m=5 is the same as for m=6 (which is 25). Then the interval [n0, n1-1] is [25,24] which is empty.\n\n        Actually, we should do:\n\n          Let L = smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n          Let R = smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m+1\n\n        Then, the numbers n for which trailing_zeros(n)==m are the numbers from L to R-1, but only if trailing_zeros(L)==m. However, if trailing_zeros(L) > m, then actually L is the start of a higher value, meaning m is skipped.\n\n        Alternatively, we can also check: if the minimal n for which trailing_zeros(n) >= m has trailing_zeros(L) != m, then there is no solution. But wait, the function trailing_zeros is non-decreasing and integer valued. So if we have:\n\n          trailing_zeros(L) = k, then for all n < L, trailing_zeros(n) < m (since L is the smallest with >=m). And then for n from L to R-1, trailing_zeros(n)=k (which might be greater than m) until R (where trailing_zeros(R) >= m+1). \n\n        But that doesn't hold. Actually, the function is non-decreasing, so once we get a value k at L, then for all n in [L, R-1] we have trailing_zeros(n)=k? Not necessarily. Actually, the function increases only at multiples of 5. But note: the function is defined for every integer and the value remains constant between the multiples of 5.\n\n        However, the minimal n for which trailing_zeros(n) >= m is the start of a plateau that goes from m to a higher value? Actually, no: the function increases by more than one at some points (like at 25, it increases by two). So the minimal n for which trailing_zeros(n)>=m might be in the middle of a plateau.\n\n        Actually, the standard way is:\n\n          Let F(n) = trailing_zeros(n)\n\n          We want to know the set { n | F(n) = m }\n\n          We can use:\n\n            low = 0, high = a sufficiently large number (like 5*m, but m can be up to 100000, so we might need more)\n\n          However, we can use binary search for the lower bound for m and for m+1.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n          Define a function f(n): returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n          Then:\n\n          Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. (call this L)\n          Step 2: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. (call this R)\n\n          Now, if f(L) != m, then there is no n with trailing zeros exactly m. Why? Because the smallest n that gets at least m has more than m, meaning that the maximum value on the left side is less than m, and then the first time we hit at least m we jump above m. Then we don't have any n with exactly m.\n\n          However, wait: the function is non-decreasing and integer-valued. The set of n for which f(n)=m is the set of n such that f(n) >= m and f(n) < m+1.\n\n          But note: the set of n for which f(n) >= m is [L, infinity). And the set of n for which f(n) >= m+1 is [R, infinity). Then the set of n for which m <= f(n) < m+1 is [L, R-1]. But note: we require f(n)=m, so we must ensure that for n in [L, R-1], f(n) is exactly m. This is true because:\n\n            For n < L: f(n) < m.\n            For n in [L, R-1]: f(n) >= m (by definition of L) and f(n) < m+1 (because R is the first n with f(n)>=m+1).\n\n          However, what if in [L, R-1] the function f(n) sometimes is m and sometimes is more than m? \n\n          Actually, no. The function f(n) is non-decreasing. Once we reach a value at L that is at least m, then for all n >= L, f(n) >= m. But we don't know if it is exactly m until we hit the next jump. However, the next jump is at R, so from L to R-1, f(n) remains constant? Not necessarily.\n\n          Example: m=4. Then we know that f(20)=4, f(21)=4, f(22)=4, f(23)=4, f(24)=4, f(25)=6.\n\n          So for m=4, L=20, R=25. Then the numbers from 20 to 24 (inclusive) are the ones with exactly 4 zeros.\n\n          Now, what if m=6? Then L=25 (since f(24)=4 <6, f(25)=6) and then we look for R: smallest n such that f(n)>=7. How many zeros does 25! have? 6. Then 26,27,28,29: still 6. Then 30: \n            f(30) = 30//5 + 30//25 = 6+1 = 7.\n          So R=30. Then the numbers from 25 to 29 are the ones with exactly 6 zeros.\n\n          Now, what if m=5? Then we look for L: smallest n with f(n)>=5. Since f(24)=4, f(25)=6 -> so the smallest n is 25. Then we look for R: smallest n with f(n)>=6 -> 25. Then the interval is [25,24] -> empty. So we output 0.\n\n          But wait, what if the function jumps from 4 to 6, skipping 5. Then we don't have any n with 5 zeros.\n\n          Therefore, the procedure is:\n\n            L = lower_bound(m)   [smallest n such that f(n) >= m]\n            R = lower_bound(m+1) [smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1]\n\n            Then, the set of n is the integers from L to R-1, inclusive. But note: we must check that the entire interval [L, R-1] indeed has f(n)=m. However, because of the non-decreasing nature, we know:\n\n              For n < L: f(n) < m.\n              For n >= L and n < R: f(n) >= m and f(n) < m+1 (because R is the first n with f(n)>=m+1). Since f(n) is integer, then for n in [L, R-1], we have m <= f(n) < m+1, so f(n)==m.\n\n          Therefore, the set is all n from L to R-1, and the number of such n is (R - L).\n\n          However, if R==L, then the set is empty (because the interval [L, L-1] is empty). So then we output 0.\n\n          But note: the problem requires to output:\n\n            First print k (the number of values) and then the k integers in increasing order.\n\n          Example: m=1 -> L=5, R=10 (because f(5)=1, f(6)=1, f(7)=1, f(8)=1, f(9)=1, and f(10)=2). Then k=5, and the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n          Example: m=5 -> L=25, R=25 -> k=0.\n\n        However, wait: how do we compute L and R?\n\n          We need to write a function for f(n) and then use binary search.\n\n        The challenge: the n can be very large. We know that the number of trailing zeros for n! is approximately n/5 + n/25 + ... which is roughly n/4. So for m=100000, n is at most about 4*m (but actually the series is geometric). The exact upper bound: we need to find n such that f(n) >= m. Since f(n) ~ n/5 + n/25 + ... = n/(5-1) * (1 - (1/5)^floor(log5(n))) approximately n/4. So n is about 4*m. But sometimes we need more because of the gaps. However, 4*m for m=100000 is 400000, which is acceptable for binary search? Actually, we are going to do two binary searches, each over a range of [0, 5*m] (or even [0, 5*m+1]).\n\n        But note: the minimal n for which f(n) >= m might be as large as 5*m? Actually, let's see:\n\n          f(5*m) = (5*m)//5 + (5*m)//25 + (5*m)//125 + ... \n\n          This is at least (5*m)/5 + (5*m)/25 + ... which is a geometric series: (5*m)/5 * (1 + 1/5 + 1/25 + ...) = (5*m)/5 * (5/4) = m. So 5*m is an upper bound.\n\n        Actually, we can set high = 5*m + 1 (to be safe) and then do binary search.\n\n        However, note: the gaps in the trailing zeros. We are using the standard formula. The function f(n) is computed by:\n\n          def f(n):\n            count = 0\n            d = 5\n            while d <= n:\n                count += n // d\n                d *= 5\n            return count\n\n        Then, for binary search:\n\n          To find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m:\n\n            low = 0\n            high = 5*m + 1   # because we know that at 5*m we have at least m zeros.\n\n            while low < high:\n                mid = (low+high)//2\n                if f(mid) >= m:\n                    high = mid\n                else:\n                    low = mid+1\n\n            Then L = low\n\n        Similarly, for m+1.\n\n        But note: m can be up to 100000, and then 5*m is 500000, which is acceptable for binary search (log2(500000) is about 19 steps). However, the function f(n) for n=500000 will do about log5(500000) ~ 7 iterations, so it's efficient.\n\n        However, worst-case m=100000, then the binary search will run about 19*7 = 133 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the problem says m from 1 to 100000.\n\n        However, what if m is 100000? Then we are computing f(n) for n up to 500000, which is okay.\n\n        But note: the problem input is given as a single integer m (via stdin). So we read one integer.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Read m.\n\n          If m==0: then according to the problem m>=1, so we don't need to handle 0.\n\n          Compute:\n            L = lower_bound(m)\n            R = lower_bound(m+1)\n\n          Then, the answer is the list of integers from L to R-1.\n\n          But note: if R == L, then the list is empty.\n\n        Example: m=1 -> L=5, R=10, so numbers: [5,6,7,8,9]\n\n        Example: m=5 -> L=25, R=25, so numbers: [].\n\n        Example: m=6 -> L=25, R=30, so numbers: [25,26,27,28,29] -> 5 numbers.\n\n        But wait, let me check m=6: \n          f(25)=6, f(26)=6, f(27)=6, f(28)=6, f(29)=6, f(30)=7 -> correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem input might be given as a string, so we have to read it.\n\n        But note: the sample input is given as ['1','5'] but actually the problem says \"The only line of input contains an integer m\".\n\n        Therefore, we read one integer.\n\n        Code structure:\n\n          import sys\n\n          def trailing_zeros(n):\n              # returns the number of trailing zeros in n!\n              count = 0\n              d = 5\n              while d <= n:\n                  count += n // d\n                  d *= 5\n              return count\n\n          def main():\n              data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n              if not data: \n                  return\n              m = int(data[0].strip())\n\n              # Edge: m=0 is not provided, but just in case the problem changes, but the problem says m>=1.\n\n              # Find L: smallest n such that trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n              lo, hi = 0, 5*m + 1   # hi is set to 5*m+1, which is an upper bound for n to have at least m zeros.\n              L = hi\n              while lo <= hi:\n                  mid = (lo+hi)//2\n                  if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n                      L = mid\n                      hi = mid - 1\n                  else:\n                      lo = mid + 1\n\n              # Now, similarly for m+1, but if m is the maximum (100000) then m+1 is 100001, and we set hi = 5*(m+1)+1, but note: our hi for the first was 5*m+1, but for m+1 we need a larger hi.\n\n              # Alternatively, we can use the same hi = 5*(m+1)+1, but we can also note that the n for m+1 might be as large as 5*(m+1)+1, but wait: we don't know the relation between m and the zeros. However, we know that the zeros function is about n/4, so for m+1, the n is about 4*(m+1). But we set hi to 5*(m+1)+1.\n\n              # But wait: we are doing two separate binary searches. We can do:\n\n              lo2, hi2 = 0, 5*(m+1)+1\n              R = hi2\n              while lo2 <= hi2:\n                  mid = (lo2+hi2)//2\n                  if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m+1:\n                      R = mid\n                      hi2 = mid - 1\n                  else:\n                      lo2 = mid + 1\n\n              # Then, the numbers are from L to R-1.\n\n              # However, note: we must ensure that the entire interval [L, R-1] has trailing_zeros equal to m.\n\n              # But by our reasoning, yes.\n\n              # But wait: what if m is 0? The problem says m>=1, so we skip.\n\n              # Now, the count k = R - L\n\n              k = R - L\n              if k <= 0:\n                  # Then there are no numbers\n                  print(0)\n              else:\n                  # Print the numbers from L to R-1, which are k numbers.\n                  # But note: k can be large? The numbers are consecutive, so we can print them as space separated.\n\n                  # However, the problem says m can be up to 100000, and the numbers n can be up to 500000, and the range [L, R-1] can be long.\n\n                  # How long? The gaps in trailing zeros can be large, but the length of the interval for a given m is usually small (except when there is a gap). Actually, the gaps occur only when we cross a multiple of a high power of 5, but the length of the plateau (i.e., the consecutive n that have the same trailing zeros) is arbitrary? Actually, the trailing zeros remain constant until the next multiple of 5. But wait: the trailing zeros only change when n is a multiple of 5, 25, 125, etc.? Actually, no: the trailing zeros are computed by the sum of floor(n/5^i). The function is constant between multiples of 5? Actually, no: the value of floor(n/5^i) changes only when n is a multiple of 5^i. However, the entire function f(n) is constant between the multiples of 5? Actually, no: consider n=5: f(5)=1, n=6: still 1, n=10: f(10)=2, n=11: still 2. So the function is constant in the intervals [5*k, 5*(k+1)-1] for the base 5? Actually, the function increases only when n is a multiple of 5. But wait, no: the function increases by the exponent of 5 in the factorization of n. So for example, when n=25, we add 5 (from 25//5) and then 1 (from 25//25). So the jump at 25 is 2.\n\n                  # But regardless, the set of n for which f(n)=m is a contiguous set of integers, and the length of that set is (R - L). \n\n                  # However, note: we cannot output a list of numbers that might be too long (like if m=0, but m>=1). The maximum m is 100000, and the maximum length of the interval [L, R-1] is the length of the plateau for m. The plateau for a given m is from the first n that reaches m until the next jump (when n becomes the next multiple of 5 that adds zeros). But note: the zeros only increase at multiples of 5, so the plateau for m will break at the next multiple of 5 that causes an increase (unless m+1 is reached by a jump). \n\n                  # However, the length of the plateau is the difference between the next multiple of 5 that increases the zeros and the current starting point. \n\n                  # But note: the problem requires to output the k integers in increasing order. The numbers are consecutive from L to R-1, so we can output:\n\n                  #   print(k)\n                  #   print(\" \".join(str(i) for i in range(L, R)))\n\n                  # However, if k is large (like 100000) then we are printing 100000 numbers. But note: the problem says m can be up to 100000, and the set of n for which f(n)=m might be very large? \n\n                  # Actually, the set of n for which f(n)=m is the set of n from L to R-1, and the length is R-L. The maximum length? \n\n                  # Consider: the plateau for a given m can be very long? \n\n                  # Example: m=0: then the plateau is from 1 to 4, but m>=1 so we don't consider.\n\n                  # Example: m=1: the plateau is from 5 to 9 -> length 5.\n\n                  # Example: m=2: from 10 to 14 -> length 5.\n\n                  # Example: m=3: from 15 to 19 -> length 5.\n\n                  # Example: m=4: from 20 to 24 -> length 5.\n\n                  # Example: m=6: from 25 to 29 -> length 5.\n\n                  # Example: m=7: from 30 to 34 -> length 5.\n\n                  # But wait, at 25 we jumped from 4 to 6 (so m=5 is skipped). \n\n                  # Actually, the plateau for a given m is of length 5, except at the points where a multiple of a higher power of 5 occurs, the plateau might be broken earlier? \n\n                  # Let me check m=12: \n                  #   We know that f(60)=12, but what is the next jump? The next jump is at 65? Actually, the zeros increase at multiples of 5. Let's compute:\n\n                  #   f(60)= 60//5 + 60//25 + 60//125 = 12+2+0=14? Wait, that's 14. So wait, how did we get 12?\n\n                  #   Actually, let me compute step by step:\n\n                  #   We need the smallest n such that f(n)>=12.\n\n                  #   We can compute:\n\n                  #   f(45)= 45//5 + 45//25 + 45//125 = 9+1+0=10.\n                  #   f(46)=10, f(47)=10, f(48)=10, f(49)=10, f(50)= 50//5 + 50//25 + 50//125 = 10+2+0=12.\n\n                  #   Then the plateau for 12 starts at 50 and goes until the next multiple of 5 that adds a zero? Actually, the next multiple of 5 is 55, but:\n\n                  #   f(55)=55//5 +55//25+55//125=11+2+0=13.\n\n                  #   So the plateau for 12 is only one number: 50. Then 51 to 54: still 12? \n\n                  #   Let's compute:\n                  #       51: 51//5=10, 51//25=2 -> 12\n                  #       52: same, 53: same, 54: same, 55:13.\n\n                  #   So the plateau for 12 is from 50 to 54 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                  #   Then why did I think 60 had 14? Actually, 60: \n                  #       60//5=12, 60//25=2, 60//125=0 -> 14.\n\n                  #   So the zeros jump from 12 (at 54) to 13 (at 55) to 14 (at 60). \n\n                  #   Actually, the zeros are added at every multiple of 5, but sometimes more than one (like 25,50,75, etc. which are multiples of 25, then we add an extra one). \n\n                  #   But note: the plateau for a given m is the set of n from the first n that reaches m until the next n that reaches m+1 (or more). In the example m=12: the plateau is from 50 to 54, because at 55 the zeros become 13 (which is more than 12). \n\n                  #   Therefore, the length is always 5, unless the plateau is broken by a jump that goes from m to more than m+1 (like from 4 to 6). \n\n                  #   Actually, the plateau length is the distance from the start (L) to the next multiple of 5 that is a multiple of a higher power (which causes the trailing zeros to increase). \n\n                  #   However, note: the trailing zeros function only changes at multiples of 5. And the value increases by the exponent of 5 in the factorization of n (if n is divisible by 5^k but not 5^(k+1), then we add k). \n\n                  #   But the plateau for a given m is the set of n from L to the next multiple of 5 (exclusive) minus one. However, the next multiple of 5 might not necessarily cause an increase? Actually, the function f(n) is constant between multiples of 5? No, because the value of floor(n/5^i) changes only at multiples of 5^i. But the entire function f(n) is constant between multiples of 5? Actually, no: consider n=24 and n=25: \n                  #       24: floor(24/5)=4, floor(24/25)=0 -> 4\n                  #       25: floor(25/5)=5, floor(25/25)=1 -> 6.\n\n                  #   So the function changes at multiples of 5. \n\n                  #   Therefore, the plateau for a given m is from L to the next multiple of 5 (exclusive) minus one? Actually, from L to the next multiple of 5 that causes an increase (which might be the same as the next multiple of 5). \n\n                  #   But note: the zeros only increase at multiples of 5. So the value of f(n) is constant for n in [a, b] if there is no multiple of 5 in that interval. \n\n                  #   However, the plateau for m is broken at the next multiple of 5 that is within the plateau. \n\n                  #   Actually, the plateau ends at the next multiple of 5 (if that multiple causes the zeros to increase) or continues until the next multiple of 5 that causes an increase? \n\n                  #   The function f(n) increases at every multiple of 5, but the amount of increase depends on the exponent. \n\n                  #   But note: the plateau for m is the set of n for which f(n)=m. This set is contiguous and ends just before the next n0 such that f(n0)>m. \n\n                  #   Therefore, the length of the plateau is the distance from L to the next n0 (which is the smallest n>L such that f(n)>m). \n\n                  #   How to compute the next n0? That is what we did: R = smallest n such that f(n)>=m+1, so the plateau ends at R (because at R the zeros become at least m+1). \n\n                  #   Therefore, the length is R-L, and that's what we have.\n\n                  #   But note: the example m=12: \n                  #         L = 50 (because f(50)=12, and 49: f(49)=10)\n                  #         Then we compute R = smallest n such that f(n)>=13.\n                  #         f(55)=13, so R=55.\n                  #         Then the numbers are from 50 to 54 -> 5 numbers.\n\n                  #   Similarly, m=0 (if allowed) would have L=0 (if we consider 0! but the problem says positive integers, so n>=1) but anyway.\n\n                  #   Therefore, we have:\n\n                  #       k = R - L\n\n                  #   And then we output k and the list of numbers from L to R-1.\n\n          However, note: the problem requires to output the numbers in increasing order. The numbers are consecutive from L to R-1.\n\n          But if k is large (like 5, which is typical) then we can output:\n\n            print(k)\n            if k>0:\n                print(\" \".join(map(str, range(L, R))))\n\n          But if k is 0, we output:\n\n            print(0)\n\n          But wait: the problem says:\n\n            First print k, then the k integers.\n\n          Example: m=5 -> output \"0\"\n\n          Example: m=1 -> output \"5\" and then \"5 6 7 8 9\"\n\n        However, note: the problem input example:\n\n          Input: ['1', '5']\n\n          But wait, the sample input is given as two examples? Actually, the example input is:\n\n            Input: \n               1\n\n            Output:\n               5\n               5 6 7 8 9\n\n          But the example also shows:\n\n            Input: \n               5\n\n            Output:\n               0\n\n          However, the problem statement says:\n\n            Input: ['1', '5']\n\n          This might be a typo. Actually, the sample input is two separate examples: one with m=1 and one with m=5.\n\n        Let's code accordingly.\n\n        But note: performance. The trailing_zeros function is called O(log_5(n)) times per call, and we do two binary searches, each with O(log(5*m)) iterations. So total calls to trailing_zeros is about 2 * log2(5*m) * log5(5*m) which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the binary search for m and m+1, and the numbers are up to 500000 for m=100000, which is acceptable.\n\n        Let me test with m=100000.\n\n        But note: the range for binary search for m=100000 is from 0 to 500001, which is about 19 iterations. Each iteration computes trailing_zeros(n) for n up to 500000, which takes about 7 iterations (because 5^7 = 78125, 5^8=390625, 5^9=1953125 which is >500000, so 8 terms? Actually, the while loop in trailing_zeros: d starts at 5, then 25, 125, 625, 3125, 15625, 78125, 390625, and then d=1953125 which is >500000 -> 8 iterations). \n\n        So total operations: 2 * 19 * 8 = 304, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints say m can be up to 100000, and we are setting hi=5*m+1, which is 500001, so that's acceptable.\n\n        Code:\n\n          We'll implement the above.\n\n        One more edge: what if m is 100000 and the zeros jump from 100000 to 100002 (skipping 100001)? Then the set [L, R-1] will be empty because L (the smallest n with zeros>=100000) is the same as R (the smallest n with zeros>=100001). Then we output 0.\n\n        Let me check: Is that possible? Yes, because sometimes",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeroes are formed in factorials and efficiently finding all such \\( n \\) values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which is the product of the primes 2 and 5. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeroes is dictated by the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\). This can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given \\( m \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( L \\)) such that \\( \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m \\). Similarly, we find the smallest \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( R \\)) such that \\( \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The valid \\( n \\) values lie in the interval \\([L, R-1]\\), provided \\( \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(L) = m \\).\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (i.e., when \\( L = R \\)), the answer is 0. Otherwise, the solution lists all integers from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    d = 5\n    while d <= n:\n        count += n // d\n        d *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0].strip())\n    except Exception:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    lo, hi = 0, 5 * m + 1\n    while lo < hi:\n        mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            hi = mid\n        else:\n            lo = mid + 1\n    L = lo\n\n    lo2, hi2 = 0, 5 * (m + 1) + 1\n    while lo2 < hi2:\n        mid = (lo2 + hi2) // 2\n        if trailing_zeros(mid) >= m + 1:\n            hi2 = mid\n        else:\n            lo2 = mid + 1\n    R = lo2\n\n    k = R - L\n    if k <= 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        numbers = list(range(L, R))\n        print(k)\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `trailing_zeros(n)`**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search Setup**: The main function reads the input \\( m \\) and initializes binary search bounds. The upper bound for the search is set to \\( 5 \\times m + 1 \\) to ensure it covers all potential \\( n \\) values.\n\n3. **Finding \\( L \\) and \\( R \\)**:\n   - **\\( L \\)**: The smallest \\( n \\) where \\( \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m \\) is found using binary search.\n   - **\\( R \\)**: Similarly, the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m+1 \\) is found.\n\n4. **Output Handling**: The number of valid \\( n \\) values is \\( R - L \\). If this count is zero, the output is 0. Otherwise, the valid \\( n \\) values (from \\( L \\) to \\( R-1 \\)) are printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search, leveraging mathematical insights about factorial trailing zeroes to solve the problem within feasible computational limits.",
