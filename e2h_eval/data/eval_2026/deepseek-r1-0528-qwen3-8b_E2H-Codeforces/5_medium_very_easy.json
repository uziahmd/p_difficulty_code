Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem in two steps:\n 1. First, we note that a '?' can be considered as matching any color.\n 2. The goal is to form the maximum number of pairs.\n\n However, note: We cannot simply pair every '?' with something because sometimes a '?' might be needed for multiple possibilities and we have to maximize the total pairs.\n\n Approach:\n We can break down the problem into two parts:\n   a) Matching fixed colors (non '?') with fixed colors and '?' with anything.\n   b) But note: we have two strings and we need to assign without reusing an index.\n\n Since n can be up to 150000, we cannot try all possibilities.\n\n Observation:\n   We can consider that a '?' in left or right is flexible. However, we must not use the same boot twice.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We can first try to match non '?' boots. But note: sometimes a '?' can help in matching if no other match is available.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We can think greedily:\n\n Idea 1: \n   - Count the frequency of each color (from 'a' to 'z') in both left and right, but also account for '?'.\n\n However, note: the problem requires to output the pairs and their indices.\n\n Another idea:\n\n We can use a graph matching? But n=150000, so we cannot do general graph matching.\n\n Let's consider:\n\n We have two arrays: l[0..n-1] and r[0..n-1]. We want to form as many pairs as possible.\n\n Conditions for a pair (i, j):\n   - If l[i] is not '?' and r[j] is not '?', then they must be equal.\n   - If l[i] is '?' or r[j] is '?', then they are compatible.\n\n But note: the problem says an indefinite color is compatible with any color. So:\n\n   Condition: \n      if l[i] == '?' or r[j] == '?': then compatible.\n      else: l[i] == r[j]\n\n However, we are allowed to use at most one pair per boot.\n\n We want the maximum number of pairs.\n\n We can use a greedy two-phase algorithm:\n\n Phase 1: Match as many fixed boots as possible (non '?') with fixed boots.\n\n But wait: what if a fixed boot can be matched with a '?'? Actually, the problem says that '?' matches any. So we can use '?' to match fixed boots and vice versa.\n\n However, note: we have to maximize the total pairs. The maximum pairs cannot exceed n.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We can separate the left and right boots into two groups: those that are '?' and those that are fixed.\n\n But note: the fixed ones must be matched with the same fixed color, and the '?' can be used as wildcards.\n\n However, the problem is: we have two strings and we are allowed to match any left with any right (without order) as long as the condition holds.\n\n We can use a bipartite graph where edges exist between left i and right j if the condition holds.\n\n Then we want the maximum matching. But n=150000 and the graph could be very dense (each '?' node connects to all, and each fixed node only to same fixed color). This is too big for general matching.\n\n Alternative Insight:\n\n Since the condition is very structured, we can use a greedy matching by color.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute for each color (from 'a' to 'z') the positions in left and right that are that color (if fixed) and also note the positions that are '?'.\n\n   Step 2: However, we can also consider that the '?' can be used arbitrarily. So:\n\n   Let L_fixed: dictionary mapping color -> list of indices (in left) that are that color and not '?'\n   Let R_fixed: dictionary mapping color -> list of indices (in right) that are that color and not '?'\n   Let L_question: set of indices in left that are '?'\n   Let R_question: set of indices in right that are '?'\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use a '?' in left to match a fixed color in right, and vice versa.\n\n   However, we can also use a '?' to match another '?'.\n\n   How to maximize the number of pairs?\n\n   We can use the following:\n\n   Let T = total pairs.\n\n   We know that we can form at most min(n, ...) but the constraints are the counts of each color.\n\n   Actually, the maximum pairs is n (if we can match all). But we are to compute the maximum and then the pairs.\n\n   We can break the matching into two types:\n\n   Type 1: Both boots are fixed and of the same color.\n   Type 2: One or both boots are '?'.\n\n   However, we can also consider:\n\n   Step 1: Use the '?' to fill in for the fixed boots that don't have enough matches.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require to maximize by color, just the total pairs.\n\n   Actually, we can use a two-step matching:\n\n   Step 1: Match all the fixed boots (non '?') as follows:\n\n        For each color c from 'a' to 'z':\n            Let L = list of indices for left fixed boots of color c.\n            Let R = list of indices for right fixed boots of color c.\n\n            Then, we can match min(|L|, |R|) pairs for color c.\n\n        However, we must remember that the same boot (index) cannot be reused.\n\n   But wait: the fixed boots are independent per color, so we can do:\n\n        total_fixed = 0\n        for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n            count_left = len(L_fixed[c])\n            count_right = len(R_fixed[c])\n            total_fixed += min(count_left, count_right)\n\n        Then, the remaining boots (which are either fixed but not matched or '?') can be matched arbitrarily because:\n\n        The remaining left boots: \n            total_remaining_left = n - total_fixed   [but wait: this total_fixed is the sum over colors, but note: a fixed boot is counted in one color, so total_fixed is the total number of fixed boots that were matched? Actually, no: we are counting the fixed boots that are matched, but note: we are only matching fixed boots of the same color. And we are not matching the '?' yet.\n\n        Actually, we should separate the fixed boots and the '?' boots.\n\n   Let:\n\n        fixed_left = [all indices i such that l[i] != '?']\n        fixed_right = [all indices i such that r[i] != '?']\n\n        Then, we can use a dictionary for fixed boots by color.\n\n        But note: we cannot mix fixed and '?' in the fixed part. The fixed part is only for same color.\n\n   However, the above step (matching by color for fixed boots) gives us a set of pairs. Then we remove these indices from consideration.\n\n   Now, after removing the fixed pairs, we are left with:\n\n        left_remaining: indices that are either fixed but unmatched OR '?' (but note: we removed the fixed ones that were matched, but we haven't touched the unmatched fixed ones? Actually, we should not remove the fixed boots that were not matched because they might be matched with '?'? \n\n   Actually, we have two kinds of boots that can be used for matching:\n\n        - Fixed boots (non '?') can be matched with:\n            * Same color fixed boots (already done in the first step for same color)\n            * Or with a '?' (on either side)\n\n        But wait: our first step only considered fixed boots of the same color. However, a fixed boot of color 'a' can be matched with a '?' (either in left or right) but we didn't count that.\n\n   We need to maximize the total pairs. The problem is that we can use a '?' to match any, so:\n\n        After matching the fixed boots by color, we are left with:\n\n            left_side: \n                unmatched_fixed: fixed boots that were not matched (because in their color there were more on one side)\n                question_marks: all the indices that are '?' in left.\n\n            Similarly for the right_side.\n\n        Now, we can use the unmatched_fixed and the question marks to form additional pairs.\n\n        But note: an unmatched fixed boot on the left must be matched with a right boot that is either a fixed boot of the same color or a '?'. However, we already matched as many fixed boots as possible by color. Now, the remaining fixed boots (on the left) have no fixed boot of the same color on the right (because we took the minimum). So they must be matched with '?' on the right.\n\n        Similarly, an unmatched fixed boot on the right must be matched with '?' on the left.\n\n        Also, the '?' on both sides can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n   So the remaining matching is:\n\n        We have:\n            L_unmatched_fixed: set of indices i (left) such that l[i] is a letter and it wasn't matched (because in its color, the count in left was greater than in right, or vice versa).\n            R_unmatched_fixed: set of indices i (right) such that r[i] is a letter and it wasn't matched.\n\n            L_q: set of indices i (left) such that l[i]=='?'\n            R_q: set of indices i (right) such that r[i]=='?'\n\n        Now, we can form pairs from:\n\n            Option 1: A fixed boot (say color c) in left with a '?' in right (if the fixed boot is unmatched and the right has a '?')\n            Option 2: A fixed boot in right with a '?' in left.\n            Option 3: Two '?' (one left and one right)\n\n        But note: we can also use a '?' in left to match a fixed boot in right (if that fixed boot is unmatched) and vice versa.\n\n        However, we must not double count. Also, we want the maximum pairs.\n\n        Actually, we can use a bipartite graph again on the remaining nodes, but note: the remaining graph is complete (because any left node (either unmatched fixed or '?') can connect to any right node (either unmatched fixed or '?'))? \n\n        But wait: for unmatched fixed boots, they are of a specific color, and they can only be matched with a '?' (if the other side doesn't have the same fixed color) or with a fixed boot of the same color? However, we already matched all same color fixed boots, so the unmatched fixed boots on the left and right of the same color? Actually, no: we matched by color, so if a fixed boot of color 'a' is unmatched, it means that there was no fixed boot of color 'a' on the opposite side to match with. Therefore, we cannot match two unmatched fixed boots of the same color because we've already taken the minimum? Actually, we did: we matched min(L_fixed[c], R_fixed[c]) for each color. So if there are unmatched fixed boots of color 'a', then we have either extra left fixed 'a' or extra right fixed 'a'. But note: if we have extra left fixed 'a', then there is no right fixed 'a' (because we matched all the right fixed 'a' with left fixed 'a'). So these unmatched fixed boots of color 'a' (on left) cannot be matched with fixed boots of color 'a' (on right) because there are none. So they must be matched with a '?'.\n\n        Similarly for unmatched fixed boots on the right.\n\n        Now, the remaining graph (after removing the fixed pairs) is:\n\n            Left: \n                unmatched_fixed: set of indices with letter (and unmatched)\n                L_q: set of indices with '?'\n            Right:\n                R_unmatched_fixed: set of indices with letter (and unmatched)\n                R_q: set of indices with '?'\n\n        And the edges: \n            - Every left unmatched_fixed can connect to every right node (because the right node can be either unmatched_fixed or R_q). But wait: the condition for matching a left unmatched_fixed (color c) with a right unmatched_fixed (color d) is that c==d, but we already matched all same color fixed boots. However, note: we matched only the fixed boots of the same color. But the unmatched_fixed boots are left because the opposite side had fewer fixed boots of that color. So if I have a left fixed boot of color 'a' and there are no right fixed boots of color 'a', then there is no way to match this left fixed boot with a fixed boot on the right. Therefore, we must match it with a '?'.\n\n        So the remaining matching is actually:\n\n            We have two sets: \n                Left_set = unmatched_fixed (with letters) âˆª L_q\n                Right_set = R_unmatched_fixed (with letters) âˆª R_q\n\n            And the edges are defined as:\n\n                - A left node (whether unmatched_fixed or '?') can match with any right node (because if the left is '?', it matches everything; if the left is a letter, then it can match with a right node that is either the same letter (but we've already used all same-letter fixed pairs) or a '?' (since the right node being a letter must be the same, but we don't have any same letter fixed on the right for the unmatched_fixed left, so we cannot use fixed matching for unmatched_fixed left with fixed right. However, we can use the '?' in the right to match the unmatched_fixed left).\n\n            Actually, we can simplify: the remaining graph is complete? Not exactly:\n\n                - An unmatched_fixed left (say color 'a') can match with a right node that is either:\n                    * a '?' (any color) -> yes, because '?' matches everything.\n                    * a fixed boot of color 'a' -> but we've already matched all the fixed boots of color 'a' on the right, so there are none left. So no.\n                    * a fixed boot of a different color -> but then the condition fails (unless the left is '?' which it isn't). So no.\n\n                Therefore, an unmatched_fixed left (with letter) can only match with a '?' (in the right).\n\n            Similarly, an unmatched_fixed right (with letter) can only match with a '?' (in the left).\n\n            And a '?' (in left) can match with any right node (including unmatched_fixed right and '?' right).\n\n            Similarly for '?' in right.\n\n        So the remaining graph is bipartite and the edges are:\n\n            For left unmatched_fixed (letter): only to right R_q.\n            For left L_q ('?'): to all right nodes (both unmatched_fixed and R_q).\n            For right unmatched_fixed (letter): only to left L_q.\n            For right R_q ('?'): to all left nodes (both unmatched_fixed and L_q).\n\n        Now, how to maximize the matching in this bipartite graph?\n\n        Note: We have a bipartite graph with two parts: Left_remaining and Right_remaining.\n\n        We can use:\n\n            Let X = unmatched_fixed_left (letters) and Y = unmatched_fixed_right (letters)\n            Let A = L_q and B = R_q\n\n        Then the edges:\n\n            X -> only B\n            Y -> only A\n            A -> Y âˆª B\n            B -> X âˆª A\n\n        Now, we can form:\n\n            - Within the wildcards: we can match A and B arbitrarily, but note: we have |A| + |B| nodes and we can form up to min(|A|+|B|, ...) but actually we can use a bipartite matching for the entire graph.\n\n        However, note: the structure is:\n\n            We have two independent parts:\n\n                Part 1: Matching between X and B: this is a bipartite graph from X to B, and since the edges are complete (because a fixed left x (color c) can match with any '?' in B, and there's no restriction), so we can match any x with any b? But wait: the condition for x (unmatched_fixed) is that it must be matched with a '?' (which is B) and that is allowed. However, we are not restricted by color for the wildcard. So we can match any x with any b.\n\n                Similarly, we can match any y (unmatched_fixed in right) with any a (in A).\n\n            Additionally, we can use the wildcards to match with each other and also to match the fixed ones.\n\n        Actually, we can model this as:\n\n            We have two sets: \n                U = X âˆª A   (left nodes)\n                V = Y âˆª B   (right nodes)\n\n            And edges:\n\n                From X to B and to A? Actually, no: \n                    X (unmatched_fixed_left) can only go to B (R_q) because if we try to use a left unmatched_fixed to match with an unmatched_fixed_right (Y), that would require the same color, but we already matched all same color fixed pairs. So the unmatched_fixed_left of color c is unmatched because the opposite side didn't have enough fixed c. Therefore, there is no fixed c on the right. So we cannot use an unmatched_fixed_left (c) to match with an unmatched_fixed_right (d) unless c=d, but even then, we already matched the fixed pairs for c. So if there is an unmatched_fixed_left of color c, then there is no unmatched_fixed_right of color c (because we matched all the fixed c we had). Therefore, unmatched_fixed_left can only match with R_q (B).\n\n                Similarly, unmatched_fixed_right can only match with L_q (A).\n\n            Then, the edges:\n\n                X -> B\n                Y -> A\n                A -> Y âˆª B\n                B -> X âˆª A\n\n            Now, note that we can use the wildcards (A and B) to match:\n\n                We can form:\n\n                    Type 1: X with B\n                    Type 2: Y with A\n                    Type 3: A with B (but wait: a left wildcard (A) can match with a right wildcard (B) and also with unmatched_fixed_right (Y). Similarly, a right wildcard (B) can match with unmatched_fixed_left (X) and left wildcard (A).\n\n            This is a complete bipartite graph between A and (Y âˆª B) and between B and (X âˆª A). But note: we cannot use a node twice.\n\n        We can use a flow network? But n=150000, and the graph is large.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note:\n\n            The maximum matching in the remaining graph is limited by the total number of remaining nodes (which is at most 2*n). But we can use a greedy matching:\n\n            Step 1: Match as many unmatched_fixed_left (X) as possible with R_q (B). But we cannot use the same R_q twice.\n\n            Step 2: Similarly, match as many unmatched_fixed_right (Y) as possible with L_q (A).\n\n            Step 3: Then, the remaining wildcards (A and B) can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n            However, note: the wildcards can be used for both unmatched_fixed and for each other.\n\n        Actually, we can use the following:\n\n            Let M = 0\n\n            Step 1: For each color c (fixed boots), we have already matched min(L_fixed[c], R_fixed[c]) for fixed boots.\n\n            Step 2: Now, we have:\n\n                unmatched_fixed_left = { i for i in left if l[i] != '?' and (for color c=l[i], the count in left_fixed was greater than in right_fixed) }\n\n                Similarly for unmatched_fixed_right.\n\n            But note: we can also use the wildcards to match the unmatched_fixed. However, we must use the wildcards first for the unmatched_fixed? Actually, we can do:\n\n            We have two independent bipartite graphs:\n\n                Graph1: X (unmatched_fixed_left) to B (R_q) [complete bipartite]\n                Graph2: Y (unmatched_fixed_right) to A (L_q) [complete bipartite]\n\n            Then, we can use:\n\n                Let x = |X|, y = |Y|, a = |A|, b = |B|\n\n            Then, the maximum matching we can get from Graph1 is min(x, b) if we use the wildcards (B) for X. Similarly, from Graph2 is min(y, a).\n\n            Then, what remains in the wildcards? \n\n                After matching, the remaining wildcards in A and B are:\n\n                    A_remaining = a - min(y, a)   [because we used min(y, a) from A to match with Y]\n                    B_remaining = b - min(x, b)   [because we used min(x, b) from B to match with X]\n\n            Then, we can match the remaining wildcards arbitrarily: the maximum matching for the remaining wildcards (A_remaining and B_remaining) is min(A_remaining, B_remaining) because they form a complete bipartite graph.\n\n            Therefore, total pairs = \n                fixed_pairs (from step1) + min(x, b) + min(y, a) + min(A_remaining, B_remaining)\n\n            But wait: we haven't accounted for the fact that the same wildcard might be used for two different purposes? Actually, we used the wildcards for:\n\n                - Some for unmatched_fixed_left (X) and some for unmatched_fixed_right (Y) and then the rest for each other.\n\n            However, note: the sets A and B are distinct from the unmatched_fixed, and we are using them in two stages.\n\n            But let me check with an example:\n\n                Example: \n                  n=2\n                  l = \"a?\"   -> left: ['a','?'] -> unmatched_fixed_left: ['a'] (x=1), A: [index1] (a=1)\n                  r = \"?b\"   -> right: ['?','b'] -> unmatched_fixed_right: ['b'] (y=1), B: [index0] (b=1)\n\n                Step1: fixed pairs: \n                    For 'a': min(1,0)=0; for 'b': min(0,1)=0 -> fixed_pairs=0.\n\n                Then, \n                    x=1, y=1, a=1, b=1.\n\n                Step2: \n                    min(x, b)=min(1,1)=1 -> we use the wildcard in B (index0) to match the unmatched_fixed_left (index0) -> but wait, the unmatched_fixed_left is index0? Actually, our left string is \"a?\" so:\n                        l[0]='a', l[1]='?' -> so unmatched_fixed_left is [0], and the wildcard A is [1].\n                    Similarly, unmatched_fixed_right is [1] (because r[0]='?', r[1]='b') and wildcard B is [0].\n\n                Then, we match:\n                    Graph1: X (index0) with B (index0) -> but wait, index0 in left is 'a', and index0 in right is '?' -> that's allowed. Then we use the wildcard at right index0.\n\n                    Then, Graph2: Y (index1) with A (index1) -> left index1 is '?' and right index1 is 'b' -> allowed.\n\n                Then, we have matched two pairs. But note: we cannot use the same index twice. In this example, we are matching left index0 with right index0 and left index1 with right index1. That is valid.\n\n                Now, according to the formula:\n\n                    fixed_pairs = 0\n                    Then, min(x, b)=min(1,1)=1\n                    Then, min(y, a)=min(1,1)=1\n                    Then, A_remaining = a - min(y, a) = 1-1 =0, B_remaining = b - min(x, b)=1-1=0 -> no more matching.\n\n                    Total pairs = 0+1+1+0 = 2.\n\n                Now, what if we have:\n\n                  n=2\n                  l = \"a?\"   -> [0:'a',1:'?']\n                  r = \"b?\"   -> [0:'b',1:'?']\n\n                Step1: fixed pairs: \n                    'a': min(1,0)=0, 'b': min(0,1)=0 -> 0.\n\n                Then, \n                    X = [0] (unmatched_fixed_left: color 'a'), Y=[0] (unmatched_fixed_right: color 'b'), A=[1], B=[1]\n\n                Step2: \n                    Graph1: X (0) to B (1): allowed (because '?' in right matches 'a') -> so we match (0,1)\n                    Graph2: Y (0) to A (1): allowed (because '?' in left matches 'b') -> so we match (1,0)\n\n                But wait, the pairs are (0,1) and (1,0). This uses two different boots. However, note the right index1 is used in the first pair and the left index1 is used in the second. That's okay.\n\n                Now, according to the formula:\n\n                    fixed_pairs = 0\n                    min(x, b)=min(1,1)=1\n                    min(y, a)=min(1,1)=1\n                    Then, A_remaining = 1 - min(1,1)=0, B_remaining = 1 - min(1,1)=0.\n\n                Total pairs=2.\n\n            However, what if:\n\n                n=2\n                l = \"a?\"   -> [0:'a',1:'?']\n                r = \"a?\"   -> [0:'a',1:'?']\n\n                Step1: fixed pairs: \n                    'a': min(1,1)=1 -> so we match one fixed pair: say (0,0) [but note: we have two choices: we can choose which one? We must choose one. Actually, we have two fixed boots of 'a' and two '?'? \n\n                Let me break down:\n\n                    Left: [0:'a', 1:'?']\n                    Right: [0:'a', 1:'?']\n\n                Step1: fixed pairs: for 'a': min(1,1)=1. So we match one fixed 'a' with one fixed 'a'. Which one? We can choose the first one: (0,0). Then we remove left0 and right0.\n\n                Then, remaining:\n                    Left: [1:'?'] -> unmatched_fixed_left: [] (because the fixed part was already matched and the remaining is a '?'), unmatched_fixed_right: [] (because the fixed part was matched and the remaining is a '?')\n                    A = [1] (left), B = [1] (right)\n\n                Then, \n                    x=0, y=0, a=1, b=1.\n\n                Step2: \n                    min(x, b)=0, min(y, a)=0.\n                    Then, A_remaining = 1 - min(0,1)=1, B_remaining = 1 - min(0,1)=1.\n                    Then, we can match the remaining wildcards: min(1,1)=1.\n\n                Total pairs = 1 (from fixed) + 1 (from wildcards) = 2.\n\n            But wait, we have two boots, so maximum pairs is 2. This is correct.\n\n        However, the above procedure does not tell us the exact matching. We must output the pairs.\n\n        We need to:\n\n          1. First, match the fixed boots (non '?') by color.\n\n          2. Then, for the unmatched_fixed_left, we must match them with R_q (the '?' in right). But note: we must choose which '?' in right to use. Similarly for unmatched_fixed_right.\n\n          3. Then, for the remaining wildcards, we match them together.\n\n        But note: the wildcards can also be used to match the unmatched_fixed. So we must use the wildcards first for the unmatched_fixed? Actually, we can use the same wildcard for two different purposes? No, because a boot can only be used once.\n\n        Therefore, we must use the wildcards for the unmatched_fixed first, because if we use a wildcard for two unmatched_fixed, that would be two pairs. But note: the unmatched_fixed require a wildcard, and the wildcards can be used for unmatched_fixed or for the other wildcards.\n\n        However, the above calculation (min(x, b) and min(y, a)) is the maximum we can get from matching unmatched_fixed with wildcards. Then the leftover wildcards are matched with each other.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Precompute:\n\n            fixed_left: dictionary for fixed boots (non '?') in left: {color: list of indices}\n            fixed_right: dictionary for fixed boots (non '?') in right: {color: list of indices}\n\n            q_left: list (or set) of indices for left where l[i]=='?'\n            q_right: list (or set) of indices for right where r[i]=='?'\n\n          Step 2: For each color c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n            count_left = len(fixed_left.get(c, []))\n            count_right = len(fixed_right.get(c, []))\n\n            num_match = min(count_left, count_right)\n\n            Then, we will form 'num_match' pairs for color c.\n\n            We need to record which indices are used.\n\n          Step 3: Now, we have:\n\n            unmatched_fixed_left = for each color c, the indices in fixed_left[c] that are not chosen (i.e., the extra ones: count_left - num_match for each color c)\n\n            Similarly, unmatched_fixed_right = for each color c, the indices in fixed_right[c] that are not chosen.\n\n          Step 4: Let:\n\n            X = set of indices in unmatched_fixed_left (across all colors)\n            Y = set of indices in unmatched_fixed_right (across all colors)\n            A = q_left (set of indices in left that are '?')\n            B = q_right (set of indices in right that are '?')\n\n          Step 5: We want to match:\n\n            - For each index in X: we need to assign it to a '?' in B (but note: we can use any '?' in B, and we want to reserve the best for the unmatched_fixed_right later? Actually, we want to use as many wildcards as possible for the unmatched_fixed, but we don't care about the order because the graph is complete and we are going to use the minimum required).\n\n            However, we must output the pairs. We can do:\n\n            We'll create an array for the answer of size n (for left boots) and for the right boots.\n\n          Step 6: We can do:\n\n            # First, we match the unmatched_fixed_left (X) with wildcards (B) as much as possible.\n\n            Let's sort the lists for fixed_left and fixed_right by index? Actually, we don't care about the order, but we must record the pairs.\n\n            However, we are going to output the pairs in any order.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              a) For each color c, we have two lists: fixed_left[c] and fixed_right[c]. We can match the first min(|fixed_left[c]|, |fixed_right[c]|) pairs arbitrarily. But note: we must use distinct indices.\n\n            Actually, we can use:\n\n                We'll create an array for left and right to mark which indices are used.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Step 1: First, for each color c, we match the fixed boots. We can use two pointers for each color? But note: we don't need to preserve the order, but we must output the pairs.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                fixed_left_dict = {}\n                fixed_right_dict = {}\n\n                for i, color in enumerate(l):\n                    if color != '?':\n                        if color not in fixed_left_dict:\n                            fixed_left_dict[color] = []\n                        fixed_left_dict[color].append(i)\n\n                Similarly for r.\n\n                Then, for each color, we take min(len(fixed_left_dict[color]), len(fixed_right_dict[color])) and assign arbitrarily. But we don't know which ones to assign. However, we can assign arbitrarily because the problem allows any matching.\n\n            Step 7: After matching the fixed boots, we mark the used indices.\n\n            Then, for unmatched_fixed_left (X) and unmatched_fixed_right (Y), we need to match them with the wildcards.\n\n            But note: we have two independent sets: X and Y.\n\n            We can:\n\n                Sort X and Y, and then for the smallest index in X, we assign the smallest available wildcard in B? But the problem doesn't require a particular order.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a greedy matching:\n\n                We'll create a list for the remaining wildcards (both sides) and then:\n\n                For X (unmatched_fixed_left): we need to match each with a distinct wildcard in B.\n\n                For Y (unmatched_fixed_right): we need to match each with a distinct wildcard in A.\n\n                Then, the leftover wildcards (if any) are matched together.\n\n            However, we must avoid using the same wildcard twice.\n\n            Steps for matching:\n\n                Let used_B = set() for B (wildcards in right) that are already used for X.\n\n                Then, for each index in X (sorted arbitrarily), we pick a wildcard in B that is not used. But which one? We can pick the smallest index or any. But note: the problem does not specify the order of the pairs. However, the problem requires to output the pairs in k lines, and the left index and right index.\n\n                But note: we must not use the same right boot twice.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Step 1: Mark the fixed pairs.\n\n                Step 2: Then, we have:\n\n                    remaining_left = set(range(n)) - (used in fixed pairs) - (used in unmatched_fixed_left? no, unmatched_fixed_left are the ones that were not matched in fixed) -> actually, we already separated.\n\n                Actually, we have:\n\n                    fixed_used_left = set()\n                    fixed_used_right = set()\n\n                    Then, for each color c, we take the first min(L, R) from the sorted fixed_left_dict[c] and fixed_right_dict[c]. But we don't have sorted.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                    For each color c, we have two lists: left_list and right_list.\n\n                    We can use two pointers for each color to assign the fixed pairs. But we don't care about the order of the pairs, so we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    fixed_matches = []   # list of (left_index, right_index)\n\n                    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n                        lefts = fixed_left_dict.get(c, [])\n                        rights = fixed_right_dict.get(c, [])\n                        lefts.sort()\n                        rights.sort()\n                        i = 0\n                        j = 0\n                        while i < len(lefts) and j < len(rights):\n                            # We can choose arbitrarily, but we want to mark the indices as used.\n                            # We'll mark the smallest available in lefts and rights? Actually, we don't care, but we must not use the same index twice.\n\n                            # We can use the smallest index in lefts that hasn't been used and the smallest in rights? But we don't know which ones are used.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: we are going to output the pairs arbitrarily.\n\n            Since the problem does not require a specific matching, we can:\n\n                Step 1: For each color c, we take the first min(L, R) from the two lists (we don't need to sort by index, but we must record the indices). However, we can simply iterate and mark the indices.\n\n            But note: the problem requires to output the pairs. We must output the left index and the right index.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                We'll create two arrays: \n                    left_used = [False]*n\n                    right_used = [False]*n\n\n                Then, for each color c:\n\n                    left_list = fixed_left_dict.get(c, [])\n                    right_list = fixed_right_dict.get(c, [])\n\n                    We can sort left_list and right_list, and then take the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) from each.\n\n                    But then we mark those indices as used.\n\n                Then, unmatched_fixed_left = [i for i in fixed_left_dict.get(c, []) for c in ...] but we already marked the ones we used.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                For each color c, we have two lists. We can use:\n\n                    left_list_sorted = sorted(left_list)\n                    right_list_sorted = sorted(right_list)\n\n                    Then, for i in range(min(len(left_list), len(right_list))):\n                        left_index = left_list_sorted[i]\n                        right_index = right_list_sorted[i]\n\n                        Then, we record a match (left_index, right_index) and mark left_used[left_index]=True, right_used[right_index]=True.\n\n                But wait: is that valid? What if the same left_index appears in two colors? No, because an index in left can have only one color.\n\n            Then, after this, we have:\n\n                unmatched_fixed_left = [i for i in range(n) if l[i]!='?' and not left_used[i]]\n\n                Similarly for unmatched_fixed_right.\n\n            Then, we have:\n\n                A = [i for i in range(n) if l[i]=='?']   but wait, we haven't used any of the '?' in the fixed matching? Actually, we only used fixed boots (non '?') for the fixed matching.\n\n                Similarly, B = [i for i in range(n) if r[i]=='?']\n\n            But note: the fixed matching did not use any '?'.\n\n            Then, we do:\n\n                # Now, we want to match unmatched_fixed_left with B (the right wildcards) as much as possible.\n\n                Let m1 = min(len(unmatched_fixed_left), len(B))\n\n                Then, we need to choose m1 pairs from unmatched_fixed_left and B.\n\n                Similarly, m2 = min(len(unmatched_fixed_right), len(A))\n\n                Then, the remaining wildcards: \n                    A_remaining = set(A) - set(indices of A used in matching unmatched_fixed_right) \n                    B_remaining = set(B) - set(indices of B used in matching unmatched_fixed_left)\n\n                Then, m3 = min(len(A_remaining), len(B_remaining))\n\n                Total pairs = (fixed_pairs) + m1 + m2 + m3.\n\n            But note: the fixed_pairs is the sum over colors of min(L,R). Then we add m1, m2, m3.\n\n            Now, how to output the pairs?\n\n            We have three parts:\n\n                Part1: fixed_matches (from step2) -> we already have the pairs.\n\n                Part2: pairs",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of boots with matching colors. The colors can be specific letters or wildcards ('?'), which can match any color. The solution involves efficiently matching as many boots as possible while adhering to the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots based on their colors. A left boot with a specific color can only pair with a right boot of the same color or a wildcard. Similarly, wildcards can pair with any color. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs without reusing any boot.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves three main steps:\n   - **Match Fixed Boots by Color**: For each color, match left and right boots of that color. This ensures we use all possible exact matches first.\n   - **Match Unmatched Fixed Boots with Wildcards**: After processing all colors, match any remaining fixed boots (those not matched in the previous step) with wildcards from the opposite side.\n   - **Match Remaining Wildcards**: Finally, match any leftover wildcards from both sides.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm uses dictionaries to group indices of left and right boots by their colors. It then processes each color to match fixed boots. For unmatched fixed boots, it matches them with wildcards. Any remaining wildcards are matched together.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot once for each color, leading to an O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of boots. This is efficient given the constraints (n â‰¤ 150,000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    fixed_left_dict = {}\n    fixed_right_dict = {}\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        if char != '?':\n            if char not in fixed_left_dict:\n                fixed_left_dict[char] = []\n            fixed_left_dict[char].append(i)\n            \n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        if char != '?':\n            if char not in fixed_right_dict:\n                fixed_right_dict[char] = []\n            fixed_right_dict[char].append(i)\n            \n    q_left = [i for i, char in enumerate(l_str) if char == '?']\n    q_right = [i for i, char in enumerate(r_str) if char == '?']\n    \n    left_used = [False] * n\n    right_used = [False] * n\n    total_pairs = 0\n    fixed_matches = []\n    \n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        lefts = fixed_left_dict.get(c, [])\n        rights = fixed_right_dict.get(c, [])\n        lefts.sort()\n        rights.sort()\n        i = j = 0\n        count = min(len(lefts), len(rights))\n        while i < count and j < count:\n            li = lefts[i]\n            ri = rights[j]\n            fixed_matches.append((li, ri))\n            left_used[li] = True\n            right_used[ri] = True\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        total_pairs += count\n        \n    unmatched_fixed_left = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l_str[i] != '?' and not left_used[i]:\n            unmatched_fixed_left.append(i)\n            \n    unmatched_fixed_right = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if r_str[i] != '?' and not right_used[i]:\n            unmatched_fixed_right.append(i)\n            \n    A = q_left\n    B = q_right\n    \n    used_A = set()\n    used_B = set()\n    \n    part2_pairs = []\n    for idx in unmatched_fixed_left:\n        found = False\n        for jdx in B:\n            if not right_used[jdx] and jdx not in used_B:\n                part2_pairs.append((idx, jdx))\n                right_used[jdx] = True\n                used_B.add(jdx)\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            total_pairs += 1\n            \n    part3_pairs = []\n    for idx in unmatched_fixed_right:\n        found = False\n        for jdx in A:\n            if not left_used[jdx] and jdx not in used_A:\n                part3_pairs.append((jdx, idx))\n                left_used[jdx] = True\n                used_A.add(jdx)\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            total_pairs += 1\n            \n    part4_pairs = []\n    available_A = [idx for idx in A if idx not in used_A]\n    available_B = [idx for idx in B if idx not in used_B]\n    \n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < len(available_A) and j < len(available_B):\n        part4_pairs.append((available_A[i], available_B[j]))\n        i += 1\n        j += 1\n        total_pairs += 1\n        \n    all_pairs = fixed_matches + part2_pairs + part3_pairs + part4_pairs\n    \n    print(total_pairs)\n    for a, b in all_pairs:\n        print(f\"{a+1} {b+1}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots and two strings representing the colors of left and right boots.\n2. **Grouping Boots by Color**: We create dictionaries to store indices of left and right boots for each color, excluding wildcards.\n3. **Matching Fixed Boots**: For each color, we match left and right boots of that color. Each match is recorded, and the corresponding indices are marked as used.\n4. **Handling Unmatched Fixed Boots**: Any remaining fixed boots are matched with wildcards from the opposite side.\n5. **Matching Remaining Wildcards**: Any leftover wildcards from both sides are paired together.\n6. **Output**: The total number of pairs is printed, followed by each pair's indices (adjusted to 1-based indexing).\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs while ensuring no boot is reused, leveraging dictionaries for quick lookups and greedy matching for optimal results.",
