For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'] (12 notes)\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing its position in the 12-note cycle.\n 2. Since the chord is unordered, we need to consider all permutations of the three notes and check for the two patterns:\n    Pattern for major: [4, 3, 5] semitones? Actually, the definition says: \n        Major: order such that distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3 -> total from X to Z is 7.\n        Minor: order such that distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4.\n\n However, note: the distances are circular. We have 12 notes, so we can compute the circular distances.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" (if going upwards). But wait, in our representation, we have to consider the circle.\n\n However, the problem states: the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. But when we have a chord, we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily.\n\n Important: In the example, the chord \"C# B F\" is minor because we order as \"B C# F\": \n   B to C#: 1 semitone (because after B comes C, then C#) -> but wait, from B to C# is 1 semitone? Actually, let's map:\n\n Let's map the notes to numbers:\n\n   C: 0\n   C#: 1\n   D: 2\n   D#: 3\n   E: 4\n   F: 5\n   F#: 6\n   G: 7\n   G#: 8\n   A: 9\n   B: 10\n   H: 11   [Wait, note: the problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H is the last one, which is the same as B? Actually, no: the problem says there are 12 notes. And the example input includes 'A B H'. \n\n Let me clarify: the problem states: \"there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\" \n So, note: H is the 12th note. But wait, we have 12 distinct notes. Then we map:\n   C -> 0\n   C# -> 1\n   D -> 2\n   D# -> 3\n   E -> 4\n   F -> 5\n   F# -> 6\n   G -> 7\n   G# -> 8\n   A -> 9\n   B -> 10\n   H -> 11\n\n However, note the example: the chord \"A B H\" is given. \n   A = 9, B = 10, H = 11.\n\n But wait, the example output for \"A B H\" is \"strange\".\n\n How do we compute the distance between two notes?\n We can define a function to compute the distance from note a to note b (in semitones) in the forward direction (without wrapping more than once) but note: the problem says the distance is from the lowest to the highest, meaning we don't wrap around the entire circle? Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\". So they are considering two directions: \n   From C to E: 4 semitones (forward)\n   From E to C: 8 semitones (which is 12 - 4 = 8, because going backward from E to C is 8 semitones)\n\n However, in the definition of the chord, we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. So we are looking for an ordering of the three notes such that the consecutive distances (in the circular sense) meet the pattern.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we should consider the minimal upward path? Actually, no: in the example, they say the distance from E to C is 8, which is not the minimal. So we have to consider the entire circle and the direction given by the ordering.\n\n However, the problem does not specify that the chord must be played in a linear segment. They just say \"if we can order the notes so that the distance between X and Y equals 4 and between",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific distance criteria for either a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: Convert each note into a numerical value (0 to 11) based on its position in the 12-note musical scale. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, compute the forward and backward distances (mod 12) to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Chord Classification**: Check all permutations of the three notes to see if they can be ordered such that:\n   - **Major Chord**: The first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next two notes (second and third) are 3 semitones apart.\n   - **Minor Chord**: The first two notes are 3 semitones apart, and the next two notes are 4 semitones apart.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation matches the major or minor criteria, output the corresponding result. If no permutation meets either criterion, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = input().split()\n    note_to_index = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1, 'Db': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3, 'Eb': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6, 'Gb': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8, 'Ab': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes_list]\n    \n    def get_distance(a, b):\n        dist_forward = (b - a) % 12\n        dist_backward = (a - b) % 12\n        return dist_forward, dist_backward\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(a, b)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(b, c)\n        \n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(a, b)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(b, c)\n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(a, c)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(c, b)\n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(a, c)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(c, b)\n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(b, a)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(a, c)\n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(b, a)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(a, c)\n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(b, c)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(c, a)\n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(b, c)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(c, a)\n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(c, b)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(b, a)\n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(c, b)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(b, a)\n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(c, a)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(a, b)\n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n        d1_forward, d1_backward = get_distance(c, a)\n        d2_forward, d2_backward = get_distance(a, b)\n        if d1_forward == 4 and d2_forward == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        elif d1_forward == 3 and d2_forward == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n\n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The code starts by mapping each musical note to its corresponding index (0-11) in the 12-note scale. This allows for easy calculation of semitone distances.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function computes both forward and backward distances between two notes, considering the circular nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The code checks all permutations of the three notes to see if any ordering satisfies the distance criteria for a major or minor chord. For each permutation, it calculates the distances between consecutive notes and checks if they match the required patterns (4 and 3 semitones for major, 3 and 4 for minor).\n4. **Result Determination**: After checking all permutations, the code prints \"major\" if only one of the criteria is met, \"minor\" if the other is met, and \"strange\" if neither is satisfied.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the three notes are considered, making the solution robust and accurate for classifying the given chord.",
