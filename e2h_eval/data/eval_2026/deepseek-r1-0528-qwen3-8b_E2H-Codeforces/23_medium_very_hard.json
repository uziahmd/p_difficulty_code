In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. We can draw any number of extra tiles (each draw adds one tile) and we can choose any tile.\n\n We want the minimum number of draws so that we have at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Note: The hand initially has 3 tiles. After drawing k tiles, we have 3+k tiles. However, note that a mentsu requires exactly 3 tiles. So we are looking for at least one set of 3 tiles that form either:\n   - A triplet (koutsu): three identical tiles (same digit and same suit)\n   - A sequence (shuntsu): three consecutive digits in the same suit (the consecutive digits must be in increasing order, but note that the example [5s,7s,6s] is valid, so we can sort them)\n\n However, note that we don't need to use all the tiles. We just need at least one mentsu (a set of 3 tiles) in the hand.\n\n Since we can draw any tile arbitrarily many times, the problem reduces to: what is the minimum number of draws such that there exists a mentsu (triplet or sequence) in the hand?\n\n We start with 3 tiles. We can consider:\n\n Case 0: Already have a mentsu -> then answer 0.\n\n Otherwise, we consider:\n\n Option 1: Drawing 0, 1, 2, ... until we can form a mentsu.\n\n However, note: sometimes we might form a mentsu by drawing even if we don't use all the initial tiles? But wait, the problem says \"at least one mentsu\", meaning a set of three tiles (which could be from the entire hand). But note: we start with three, and then we add some. We are allowed to have more than three.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to use all the tiles. So we just need one set of three tiles that form a mentsu.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if the initial hand already has a mentsu.\n\n    - Check for koutsu: \n        Count the frequency of each tile. If any tile appears 3 times, then we have a koutsu.\n\n    - Check for shuntsu:\n        We can group by suit, then within the same suit, look for consecutive numbers (with step 1) of three.\n\n        Example: [1m,2m,3m] -> valid. But note: [1m,2m,4m] is not.\n\n        Also, the numbers are from 1 to 9, so we can check for sequences in the range 1-9.\n\n        However, note that the sequence can wrap around? No, because [9m,1m,2m] is invalid. So we require consecutive without wrapping.\n\n        For a given suit, let the distinct numbers present be sorted. Then check for consecutive triplets.\n\n        But note: we might have duplicates. However, a sequence requires distinct numbers. So we should consider each distinct number only once? Actually, no: if we have duplicates, then we cannot use the same tile twice. So we need to consider the multiset.\n\n        Actually, we have three tiles. So we can have duplicates. But a sequence requires three distinct consecutive numbers. So we must have at least one of each in the three consecutive numbers.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to have more than three tiles. But initially we have three, so if we don't have a mentsu, we are going to add some. But for the initial check, we have three tiles.\n\n        How to check for a shuntsu in the initial three tiles?\n\n        We can do:\n\n        Group by suit. For each suit, let the numbers be the set of distinct numbers that appear at least once? But wait, we need three consecutive distinct numbers. However, if we have two of the same number, then we cannot use that tile twice.\n\n        Actually, for a shuntsu, we need three distinct consecutive numbers. So we can consider:\n\n        For a suit, let S be the set of numbers (but we need to know the counts). Alternatively, we can try to see if there's a consecutive triplet [x, x+1, x+2] such that we have at least one tile of x, one of x+1, one of x+2, and they are all in the same suit.\n\n        But note: the hand may have multiple tiles of the same value in the same suit. Then we can use one occurrence of each.\n\n        So for the initial three tiles, we can:\n\n        - Extract the list of tiles, each tile is (digit, suit). We can represent the digit as an integer.\n\n        Steps for checking initial hand:\n\n        Step 1: Check for koutsu.\n            Create a frequency map for all tiles (by the string representation? Or by (suit, digit)?). But note: [1m, 1m, 1m] is a koutsu, but [1m, 1p, 1s] is not. So we have to consider the tile as a whole.\n\n            Actually, the tile is represented as a string. We can use the string as the identifier.\n\n            Alternatively, we can break into (suit, digit). But note: the input is given as three strings, each string is two characters.\n\n            Let tiles = list of three strings.\n\n            We can count the frequency of each tile string. But wait, the same tile string repeated three times gives a koutsu.\n\n            However, what if we have two different representations? Actually, the input uses the same representation.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n            c = Counter(tiles)\n            if any(count >= 3 for count in c.values()): \n                then koutsu exists.\n\n            But wait, we have exactly three tiles. So if one tile appears three times, then we have a koutsu.\n\n        Step 2: Check for shuntsu.\n\n            We need to check for each suit separately.\n\n            Let groups = {}\n            for tile in tiles:\n                s = tile[1]   # the suit part (second character)\n                num = int(tile[0])\n                if s not in groups:\n                    groups[s] = []\n                groups[s].append(num)\n\n            Then, for each suit, we want to see if there exists an integer x (from 1 to 7) such that x, x+1, x+2 are all in the set of numbers for that suit.\n\n            However, note: we might have multiple occurrences, but we just need one occurrence of each.\n\n            So for a suit, let distinct_numbers = set(groups[s])\n\n            Then check for x in [1,2,...,7]: if {x, x+1, x+2} is a subset of distinct_numbers.\n\n            But wait: what if the same tile is used for two different numbers? No, because we break by tile. Each tile is one number. And we have at most three tiles, so the set of distinct_numbers is at most three numbers.\n\n            However, note: the hand has only three tiles. So if we have three distinct numbers in the same suit, then we can check if they form a consecutive triplet.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,3m] -> yes. [1m,2m,4m] -> no. [1m,3m,4m] -> no (because we don't have 2m). [2m,3m,4m] -> yes.\n\n            But also, what if we have duplicate numbers? Then the set will have fewer than 3 numbers, so no.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n            for suit, nums in groups.items():\n                s_nums = set(nums)\n                for x in range(1, 8):\n                    if {x, x+1, x+2} <= s_nums:\n                        then we have a shuntsu.\n\n            However, note: we are only given three tiles. So if we have a shuntsu, then we must have exactly three distinct numbers (if the three tiles are distinct) and they form a consecutive triplet.\n\n            But what if we have two of the same number and one different? Then the set will have two elements, and we cannot form a consecutive triplet.\n\n            So the above condition works.\n\n        Therefore, if either condition holds, then we output 0.\n\n 2. If not, then we consider drawing 1, 2, ... tiles.\n\n    We can draw up to 2 tiles (because with 3+2=5 tiles, we can form multiple mentsus, but we only need one). Actually, we can stop at 2 because:\n\n    - With 0 draws: already checked (0)\n    - With 1 draw: we have four tiles. Then we might form a mentsu by having a triplet (if we draw two more of an existing tile) or a sequence (if we draw a tile that completes a sequence).\n\n    But note: we can also form a triplet by drawing two copies of an existing tile (if we have one copy, then drawing two more gives three). Or for a sequence, we might be missing one or two tiles.\n\n    However, note: the problem asks for the minimum number of draws.\n\n    We can try:\n\n    Case 0: 0 draws -> done.\n\n    Case 1: 1 draw.\n\n        Possibilities for 1 draw:\n\n        Option A: Form a triplet.\n\n            We can choose to draw two copies of an existing tile? Actually, no: we are only allowed to draw one tile. So we cannot complete a triplet by drawing two copies. \n\n            But wait: we can draw one tile and then we have four tiles. Then we can use three of them to form a triplet? \n\n            Example: if we have [1m, 1m, 2m], then drawing one more 1m would give [1m,1m,1m,2m] -> now we have a triplet (three 1m). But wait, we only drew one tile, so we have four tiles. The triplet is formed by three 1m. \n\n            However, the definition of triplet is three identical tiles. So if we have three 1m, then we have a mentsu.\n\n            So how many draws are needed for a triplet?\n\n            We can check for each distinct tile: if we have n copies of a tile, then we need (3 - n) copies. But we are allowed to draw one tile, so we can only add one copy.\n\n            So if there exists a tile that we have at least 2 copies, then drawing one more copy of that tile would make it 3 copies -> triplet.\n\n            Similarly, for a sequence: we might be able to complete a sequence by drawing one tile.\n\n            Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> we can draw 3m to complete the sequence [1m,2m,3m,4m] (we don't need to use the 4m for the sequence? Actually, we can choose which three to use). So we can form [1m,2m,3m] from the drawn 3m.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to have more than three tiles, so we don't need to use all.\n\n            So for a sequence, we can consider:\n\n            For each suit, we look at the distinct numbers we have, and then we see what consecutive triplets we can form by adding one tile.\n\n            Alternatively, we can think: what sequences are missing one tile?\n\n            In a given suit, let S be the set of numbers we have.\n\n            Then, for a sequence [x, x+1, x+2], we can form it if we have at least two of the three numbers, and we are missing one. Then drawing the missing number in that suit would complete the sequence.\n\n            Also, note: we might complete a triplet by drawing one tile if we already have two of a kind.\n\n            So for one draw:\n\n            - Triplet: if there exists a tile (represented by string) such that the count of that tile is 2, then drawing one more of that tile gives a triplet.\n\n            - Sequence: if there exists a suit and a starting number x (from 1 to 7) such that in that suit, we have two out of the three consecutive numbers [x, x+1, x+2]. Then drawing the missing one would complete the sequence.\n\n            Additionally, note: we might have a tile that appears only once, but we can draw two different tiles that together form two parts of a sequence? But wait, we are only drawing one tile.\n\n            Therefore, for one draw:\n\n            Conditions:\n\n            Condition1: There exists a tile t that appears at least twice. Then drawing one more t gives a triplet.\n\n            Condition2: There exists a suit s and a consecutive triplet [x, x+1, x+2] such that we have two of the three numbers in suit s, and the third is missing. Then drawing the missing number in suit s (as a string, e.g., str(x)+'s') would complete the sequence.\n\n            However, note: the tile we draw can be any tile. So we can choose to draw either a tile for a triplet or for a sequence.\n\n            Therefore, if either condition holds, then we can do it in 1 draw.\n\n    Case 2: 2 draws.\n\n        If we cannot do it in 0 or 1, then we check if we can do it in 2.\n\n        Possibilities:\n\n        Option A: Form a triplet by drawing two tiles (if we have one copy of a tile, then drawing two more copies of that tile).\n\n        Option B: Form a sequence by drawing two tiles (if we are missing two numbers in a consecutive triplet).\n\n        But note: we might also form a triplet by having two copies and then drawing one more? Actually, we already considered one draw for triplet if we have two copies.\n\n        Now, for two draws:\n\n        Condition1 (Triplet): There exists a tile that appears at least once, and we draw two more copies. Then we have three copies. So if there is at least one tile (any tile) that we can use, then two draws.\n\n        But wait: is two draws the minimum for triplet if we don't have two copies? Actually, we can also form a triplet by drawing two tiles of the same type. However, if we have one copy, then we need two more, so two draws.\n\n        However, note: we might form a triplet by drawing two different tiles? No, because triplet requires three identical.\n\n        Condition2 (Sequence): We might be missing two numbers for a consecutive triplet. Then we can draw both.\n\n        But note: we might also form a triplet by drawing two tiles (if we don't have two copies, but we can draw two copies of one tile). \n\n        Actually, the minimal number of draws is the minimum over:\n\n          - 0: already done\n          - 1: if either condition holds for one draw\n          - 2: if either condition holds for two draws\n\n        But wait: are there cases that require more than 2 draws? \n\n        Consider: we have three distinct tiles, none of which form a triplet or a sequence, and we don't have two of the same.\n\n        Example: ['1m','2p','3s']\n\n        Then we can draw two tiles to form a triplet: for example, draw two '1m' -> then we have three '1m'. That takes two draws.\n\n        But is two draws always sufficient?\n\n        Actually, note: we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. So we can always form a triplet by drawing two copies of one of the existing tiles (if we have at least one copy). Since we have three tiles, we have at least one copy of each? Actually, no: we might have duplicates? \n\n        Wait, our initial hand has three tiles. They can be duplicates. But if we don't have a mentsu and we don't have two of the same, then we have three distinct tiles.\n\n        Then, we can always form a triplet by drawing two copies of one of the three. So two draws.\n\n        But wait, maybe we can form a sequence with two draws? \n\n        However, note: the problem asks the minimum number of draws. So if we can form a triplet in two draws, then two is the answer.\n\n        But is there a possibility that two draws can form a mentsu by a sequence? \n\n        Example: We have [1m, 2m, 4m]. We don't have a sequence. To form a sequence, we need [1,2,3] or [2,3,4] or [3,4,5] etc.\n\n        Currently, we have 1m and 2m. We can draw 3m to complete [1,2,3] (so one draw) -> but we already considered one draw.\n\n        But if we have [1m, 4m, 7m] (all distinct and not consecutive), then we can draw two tiles to form a sequence? \n\n        For example, we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1,2,3] (using the 1m we have). But note: we are allowed to use the drawn tiles arbitrarily. However, we are only concerned with forming one mentsu (a set of three). \n\n        We can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m. Then we have five tiles: [1m,4m,7m,2m,3m]. This set contains [1m,2m,3m] as a mentsu.\n\n        So two draws for a sequence is possible.\n\n        But note: we might also form a triplet in two draws (if we have one copy of a tile, we draw two more). \n\n        Therefore, the maximum we need is 2.\n\n        However, wait: is there a case that requires 3 draws? \n\n        According to the above, if we can't do 0,1, or 2, then we need more? But note: we can always form a triplet by drawing two copies of one of the existing tiles (if we have at least one copy). Since we have three tiles, we have at least one copy of three different tiles? Not necessarily: we might have duplicates.\n\n        Actually, the problem states: we start with three tiles. The worst-case scenario is three distinct tiles (no duplicates). Then:\n\n        - 0 draws: no mentsu.\n        - 1 draw: \n            Triplet: no, because we have one of each.\n            Sequence: we might complete a sequence if we have two consecutive in a suit and one missing. But if the three tiles are in different suits, then we cannot form a sequence (since sequence requires same suit). \n\n        Example: ['1m','1p','1s'] -> no triplet (because they are different suits) and no sequence (different suits). Then:\n\n        One draw: \n            Triplet: we have one of each, so if we draw one more tile, we can only complete a triplet if we draw two more of one of them, but one draw only gives one. So we cannot complete a triplet in one draw.\n\n            Sequence: we have three different suits. Even if we draw a tile, we can only complete a sequence in one suit. But we have only one tile per suit. So for example, we have 1m. To form a sequence in manzu, we need three consecutive. We have only 1m. Then we need two more: 2m and 3m. But we can only draw one tile, so we can't complete a sequence.\n\n            Therefore, one draw is not enough.\n\n        Then two draws: we can draw two more 1m (to get three 1m) -> triplet. So two draws.\n\n        Alternatively, we can draw two tiles to complete a sequence in one suit? For example, in manzu: we have 1m. Then we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m]. Then we have five tiles: [1m,1p,1s,2m,3m]. Now we have a sequence [1m,2m,3m]. So two draws.\n\n        But wait: we have three suits. We can choose any suit to form a sequence. In this example, we have one tile in each suit. We can choose one suit (say manzu) and complete its sequence.\n\n        However, note: we have three distinct suits. We can draw two tiles for one suit, leaving the other two suits as they are.\n\n        So two draws are sufficient.\n\n        Now, is there a case that requires three draws?\n\n        Consider: we have three tiles that are all the same suit but not forming a sequence and no duplicates.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 4m]\n\n        We checked 0 draws: no.\n        1 draw: \n            Triplet: no (one of each).\n            Sequence: we have 1m and 2m, so we can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 3m -> one draw.\n\n        So that's one draw.\n\n        Another example: [1m, 3m, 5m] (same suit, no consecutive)\n\n        0 draws: no.\n        1 draw: \n            Triplet: no.\n            Sequence: We have 1,3,5. We can complete a sequence if we have two consecutive numbers? We don't. We can complete [0,1,2] but 0 doesn't exist. [1,2,3]: we have 1 and 3, but missing 2. [2,3,4]: missing 2 and 4. [3,4,5]: we have 3 and 5, missing 4. [4,5,6]: missing 4 and 6. etc.\n\n            Actually, we can complete [1,2,3] by drawing 2m. Then we have [1m,2m,3m,5m] -> we can form [1,2,3] (using the drawn 2m). So one draw.\n\n        Another example: [1m, 1m, 4m] (two of a kind, but not a triplet)\n\n        0 draws: no (not three 1m, and no sequence: 1,4 -> not consecutive)\n        1 draw: \n            Triplet: we have two 1m, so drawing one more 1m gives triplet -> one draw.\n\n        So two draws is the maximum we need.\n\n        But wait, what if the three tiles are: [1m, 2m, 3p] (one sequence in manzu but the other tile is in pinzu)\n\n        0 draws: we have a sequence in manzu? [1m,2m,?] -> we don't have 3m, we have 3p. So no. Actually, the sequence must be in the same suit. So [1m,2m,3m] is a sequence, but we don't have 3m. We have 3p. So no.\n\n        Then 1 draw: \n            Triplet: we don't have two of the same, so no.\n            Sequence: \n                Manzu: we have [1m,2m] and we can draw 3m to complete -> so one draw.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\n        So we can summarize:\n\n        We need to check:\n\n        Step 0: Check for 0 draws.\n\n        Step 1: Check for 1 draw.\n\n            Condition for 1 draw:\n\n            a) There exists a tile (type) that appears at least 2 times. Then we can draw one more of that tile to complete a triplet.\n\n            b) There exists a suit and a consecutive triplet [x, x+1, x+2] such that we have two of the three numbers in that suit (i.e., we have two distinct numbers from the triplet, and the third is missing). Then we can draw the missing number in that suit to complete the sequence.\n\n        Step 2: Check for 2 draws.\n\n            Condition for 2 draws:\n\n            a) There exists at least one tile (any tile) that appears at least once. (Since we have three tiles, we have at least one copy of each tile we have, but note: we might have duplicates, but if we didn't meet the one-draw condition, then we don't have two copies of any tile. But wait, we might have one copy of a tile, and we can draw two more copies of that tile to form a triplet. \n\n            Actually, we can always form a triplet by drawing two copies of one of the existing tiles (if we have at least one copy). Since we have three tiles, we have at least one copy of three tiles (if they are distinct) or less if there are duplicates.\n\n            But if we have duplicates, then we might have already considered one-draw condition (if we had two copies). So if we are at two draws, then we don't have two copies of any tile.\n\n            Therefore, in two draws, we have three tiles and no two are the same. Then we have three distinct tiles.\n\n            Then, we can form a triplet by drawing two copies of one of these three.\n\n            Alternatively, we might form a sequence by drawing two tiles (if we are missing two numbers in a consecutive triplet). But note: we are allowed to form the sequence from any three tiles in the hand (including the ones we draw). \n\n            However, we can also form a triplet. So two draws are always sufficient.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is either 0, 1, or 2.\n\n        But wait: is there a scenario where two draws are necessary but not one? \n\n        Example: three distinct tiles, no two same and no consecutive triplet missing only one.\n\n        Example: [1m, 2p, 3s] (three distinct suits, and each tile is one of its suit). \n\n        0 draws: no.\n        1 draw: \n            Triplet: no, because no duplicate.\n            Sequence: we have one tile per suit, so for each suit we have one tile. To complete a sequence in a suit, we need two more. So one draw is not enough.\n\n        Then we must use two draws: we can draw two copies of one of the tiles to form a triplet, or we can draw two tiles to complete a sequence in one suit.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n        Let tiles = list of three strings.\n\n        Step 1: Check for 0 draws.\n\n        Step 2: Check for 1 draw.\n\n        Step 3: Otherwise, 2 draws.\n\n        But wait: are there cases that require more than 2 draws? We argued that two draws are always sufficient because we can always form a triplet by drawing two copies of one of the existing tiles.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to draw any tile. So even if we have three distinct tiles, we can draw two copies of one of them to form a triplet.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is at most 2.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        def main():\n            data = input().split()\n            if len(data) == 0:\n                print(0)\n                return\n\n            # There should be three strings\n            tiles = data\n\n            # Step 0: Check for 0 draws (already a mentsu)\n            if has_mentsu(tiles):\n                print(0)\n                return\n\n            # Step 1: Check for 1 draw\n            if can_one_draw(tiles):\n                print(1)\n                return\n\n            # Step 2: Otherwise, 2 draws\n            print(2)\n\n        Now, we need to define:\n\n        has_mentsu(tiles):\n\n            Check for koutsu and shuntsu.\n\n            Koutsu: any tile repeated three times?\n            But note: we have three tiles. So if a tile appears three times, then koutsu.\n\n            Alternatively, we can check: \n                from collections import Counter\n                count = Counter(tiles)\n                if any(c >= 3 for c in count.values()):\n                    return True\n\n            But wait: what if we have two different representations of the same tile? The tile is represented as a string. The input format: the first character is digit, second is suit. So [1m, 1m, 1m] is three times the string '1m'.\n\n            However, the problem says: triplet is three identical tiles. So the string must be the same.\n\n            Then, check for shuntsu:\n\n            Group by suit (the second character). For each suit, extract the numbers (first character) and convert to integers.\n\n            Then, for each suit group, let S be the set of numbers.\n\n            Then, for x from 1 to 7:\n                if {x, x+1, x+2} <= S:\n                    return True\n\n            But note: we are only concerned with the existence of three consecutive numbers (regardless of duplicates). However, if we have duplicates, we still only need one occurrence of each.\n\n            Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> set is {1,2}. Then we check: \n                x=1: {1,2,3} -> not subset.\n                x=2: {2,3,4} -> not.\n                so no.\n\n            But wait, we have two 1m and one 2m. We don't have 3m. So no.\n\n            However, we have two 1m, but we can use one 1m for the sequence? The sequence requires three distinct consecutive numbers.\n\n            So we require three distinct numbers.\n\n            Therefore, the set condition is correct.\n\n            However, note: we are only given three tiles. So the set for a suit can have at most three numbers.\n\n            So the code for has_mentsu:\n\n            def has_mentsu(tiles):\n                # Check for triplet (koutsu)\n                from collections import Counter\n                count_tiles = Counter(tiles)\n                if max(count_tiles.values()) >= 3:\n                    return True\n\n                # Check for shuntsu\n                groups = {}\n                for tile in tiles:\n                    # tile is string of length 2\n                    s = tile[1]\n                    num = int(tile[0])\n                    if s not in groups:\n                        groups[s] = set()\n                    groups[s].add(num)\n\n                for s, nums in groups.items():\n                    # Check for consecutive triplet in nums\n                    # Sort the nums and then check for consecutive sequence\n                    # But note: we have at most 3 numbers, so we can do:\n                    nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n                    # We need to check for consecutive triplet in the set\n                    for i in range(len(nums_sorted)-2):\n                        if nums_sorted[i+1] == nums_sorted[i] + 1 and nums_sorted[i+2] == nums_sorted[i] + 2:\n                            return True\n\n                    # Alternatively, we can check for the consecutive triplet by iterating over possible x, but since the set is small, we can also do:\n                    # But the above loop is O(n) and n<=3, so we can also do:\n\n                    # Another way: check for every x from 1 to 7: if {x, x+1, x+2} is a subset of nums.\n                    # But we did above by sorting and checking consecutive triple. Both are acceptable.\n\n                    # However, the above loop only checks if the three numbers are consecutive and sorted. But note: the set might have numbers that are not consecutive, but we are only concerned with the consecutive triplet.\n\n                    # But wait: if we have [1,3,4] then we don't have a consecutive triplet. The above loop would check:\n                    #   i=0: 1,3 -> 3 != 1+1 -> skip.\n                    #   i=1: 3,4 -> 4 != 3+1 -> skip.\n                    # So no.\n\n                    # Alternatively, we can check for the consecutive triplet by:\n                    #   min_val = min(nums)\n                    #   max_val = max(nums)\n                    #   if max_val - min_val == 2 and len(nums)==3:\n                    #       then they are consecutive? [min_val, min_val+1, min_val+2] -> yes.\n\n                    # But wait, what if we have [1,2,4]? Then min_val=1, max_val=4, difference=3, and length=3 -> not consecutive.\n\n                    # Actually, the consecutive triplet must be exactly [x, x+1, x+2]. The above method (with the for loop) is correct.\n\n                    # However, the above for loop does not cover the case when the consecutive triplet is not the smallest three? Actually, we sorted, so we are checking every consecutive triple in the sorted list. But the consecutive triplet must be contiguous.\n\n                    # But note: we are only allowed to use three distinct numbers. The sorted list might have duplicates? No, because we used set.\n\n                    # So the above for loop is sufficient.\n\n                return False\n\n            However, wait: the above for-loop in the shuntsu check only checks if there exists three consecutive numbers that are adjacent in the sorted list. But what if the numbers are not adjacent? Example: [1,2,4] -> we don't have 3, so we don't have a consecutive triplet.\n\n            Actually, the above for-loop only checks adjacent pairs. It's correct.\n\n            But there's an alternative: we can iterate x from 1 to 7 and check if {x, x+1, x+2} is a subset of nums. This is simpler and also works for sets of size 3.\n\n            Since the set is small (at most 3), we can do:\n\n            for x in range(1, 8):\n                if {x, x+1, x+2}.issubset(nums):\n                    return True\n\n            But note: we don't care about the order.\n\n            Which is better? The subset method is straightforward.\n\n            However, the problem says the numbers are from 1 to 9, so x from 1 to 7 is safe.\n\n            So let me rewrite the shuntsu part:\n\n            groups = {}\n            for tile in tiles:\n                s = tile[1]\n                num = int(tile[0])\n                if s not in groups:\n                    groups[s] = set()\n                groups[s].add(num)\n\n            for s, nums in groups.items():\n                for x in range(1, 8):\n                    if x in nums and x+1 in nums and x+2 in nums:\n                        return True\n\n            But wait, is that correct? \n\n            Example: [1m,2m,3m] -> x=1: 1,2,3 in nums -> True.\n\n            Example: [2m,3m,4m] -> x=2: 2,3,4 -> True.\n\n            Example: [1m,3m,4m] -> x=1: 1,2,3 -> 2 is missing -> fails; x=2: 2,3,4 -> 2 is missing -> fails; x=3: 3,4,5 -> 5 is missing -> fails.\n\n            So that's correct.\n\n            However, note: the set of numbers might have more than three? But we have only three tiles, so the set has at most three numbers.\n\n            So we can use:\n\n            def has_mentsu(tiles):\n                from collections import Counter\n                cnt = Counter(tiles)\n                if any(cnt[tile] >= 3 for tile in cnt):\n                    return True\n\n                groups = {}\n                for tile in tiles:\n                    s = tile[1]\n                    num = int(tile[0])\n                    if s not in groups:\n                        groups[s] = set()\n                    groups[s].add(num)\n\n                for nums in groups.values():\n                    # We'll check for x in [1,2,...,7]\n                    for x in range(1, 8):\n                        if x in nums and x+1 in nums and x+2 in nums:\n                            return True\n                return False\n\n        Now, for one draw:\n\n        can_one_draw(tiles):\n\n            Condition1: There exists a tile (string) that appears at least two times. Then we can draw one more of that tile to form a triplet.\n\n            Condition2: There exists a suit and a consecutive triplet [x, x+1, x+2] such that we are missing one number (i.e., we have two of the three numbers in that suit). Then drawing the missing number (in that suit) would complete the sequence.\n\n            However, note: we can also complete a sequence by drawing one tile, and that tile must be the missing number in a consecutive triplet.\n\n            Steps:\n\n            Condition1: \n                from collections import Counter\n                cnt = Counter(tiles)\n                for tile, count in cnt.items():\n                    if count >= 2:\n                        return True\n\n            Condition2:\n                Group by suit, and for each suit, we have a set of numbers.\n\n                For each suit, and for each consecutive triplet [x, x+1, x+2] (x from 1 to 7), check if the suit has two of the three numbers. Then, we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n                But note: we might have multiple suits and multiple triplets.\n\n                Example: [1m,1m,2m] -> Condition1 already holds, so we don't need Condition2.\n\n                But if Condition1 fails, then we have no tile repeated twice.\n\n                Then, for each suit and each consecutive triplet:\n\n                    missing = {x, x+1, x+2} - nums\n\n                    if len(missing) == 1:\n                        then we can draw that missing tile (which is str(missing.pop()) + s) to complete the sequence.\n\n                However, note: the tile we draw must be in the same suit. And the missing number is an integer between 1 and 9, so the string representation is str(missing)+s.\n\n                But wait, we are not restricted by the availability of the tile (we can draw any tile arbitrarily). So if there exists one consecutive triplet in any suit that is missing exactly one number, then we can complete it in one draw.\n\n            But note: we might have the same consecutive triplet in two different",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial hand already contains a mentsu. A mentsu can be either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same digit and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive digits in the same suit (e.g., 1m, 2m, 3m).\n\n2. **Check for One-Draw Mentsu**: If no mentsu exists initially, we then check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This can happen in two ways:\n   - **Triplet Completion**: If any tile appears at least twice, drawing one more of that tile completes a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Completion**: If for any suit, two of the three consecutive numbers in a potential sequence are present, drawing the missing number completes the sequence.\n\n3. **Default to Two Draws**: If neither of the above conditions is met, then drawing two tiles will always suffice. This is because we can either complete a triplet by drawing two more of an existing tile or complete a sequence by drawing the two missing numbers in a potential sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n    from collections import Counter\n    cnt = Counter(tiles)\n    for tile, count in cnt.items():\n        if count >= 3:\n            return True\n            \n    groups = {}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        s = tile[1]\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        if s not in groups:\n            groups[s] = set()\n        groups[s].add(num)\n        \n    for nums in groups.values():\n        for x in range(1, 8):\n            if x in nums and x+1 in nums and x+2 in nums:\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef can_one_draw(tiles):\n    from collections import Counter\n    cnt = Counter(tiles)\n    for tile, count in cnt.items():\n        if count >= 2:\n            return True\n            \n    groups = {}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        s = tile[1]\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        if s not in groups:\n            groups[s] = set()\n        groups[s].add(num)\n        \n    for suit, nums in groups.items():\n        for x in range(1, 8):\n            needed = {x, x+1, x+2} - nums\n            if len(needed) == 1:\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    tiles = data\n    if has_mentsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n    elif can_one_draw(tiles):\n        print(1)\n        return\n    else:\n        print(2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **has_mentsu Function**: This function checks if the initial hand contains a mentsu by verifying for any triplet (three identical tiles) or sequence (three consecutive digits in the same suit). It uses a counter to check for triplets and groups tiles by suit to check for sequences.\n\n2. **can_one_draw Function**: This function checks if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. It first checks if any tile appears at least twice (allowing a triplet with one more draw). If not, it checks each suit for sequences missing exactly one number, which can be completed by drawing that missing number.\n\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the input, checks for existing mentsu, then checks if one draw can form a mentsu. If neither condition is met, it defaults to two draws, as this is always sufficient to form a mentsu by completing a triplet or sequence. \n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem by systematically checking for possible mentsu formations with minimal draws, ensuring optimal performance.",
