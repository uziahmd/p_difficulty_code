The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n This means that if a_i is even, then we need a key with odd integer (b_j) to open it.\n Similarly, if a_i is odd, then we need a key with even integer (b_j) to open it.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Separate the chests into two groups:\n    - Group0: even numbers (a_i % 2 == 0)\n    - Group1: odd numbers (a_i % 2 != 0)\n\n 2. Similarly, separate the keys into two groups:\n    - Group0_keys: even numbers (b_j % 2 == 0)\n    - Group1_keys: odd numbers (b_j % 2 != 0)\n\n 3. Now, note that:\n    - Even chest can be opened by an odd key (from Group1_keys)\n    - Odd chest can be opened by an even key (from Group0_keys)\n\n 4. However, we cannot use a key more than once and a chest only once.\n\n 5. The problem then reduces to matching between:\n    - The number of even chests and the available odd keys (for even chests)\n    - The number of odd chests and the available even keys (for odd chests)\n\n But note: the condition is strict and independent.\n\n However, wait: there's no cross condition because the parity condition is fixed.\n\n So, for even chests (Group0), we need odd keys (Group1_keys). The maximum chests we can open from Group0 is min(|Group0|, |Group1_keys|).\n\n Similarly, for odd chests (Group1), we need even keys (Group0_keys). The maximum chests we can open from Group1 is min(|Group1|, |Group0_keys|).\n\n Then total chests = min(|Group0|, |Group1_keys|) + min(|Group1|, |Group0_keys|)\n\n Let's test with the examples:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd (Group1)\n        14 -> even (Group0)\n        6 -> even (Group0)\n        2 -> even (Group0)\n        11 -> odd (Group1)\n\n   So, Group0: [14,6,2] -> count = 3\n      Group1: [9,11] -> count = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8 -> even (Group0_keys)\n        4 -> even (Group0_keys)\n        7 -> odd (Group1_keys)\n        20 -> even (Group0_keys)\n\n   Group0_keys: [8,4,20] -> count = 3\n   Group1_keys: [7] -> count = 1\n\n   For even chests: min(3, 1) = 1\n   For odd chests: min(2, 3) = 2\n   Total = 1+2 = 3 -> matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n   Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> Group0: 5, Group1: 0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> Group0_keys: 0, Group1_keys: 1\n\n   For even chests: min(5,1)=1\n   For odd chests: min(0,0)=0\n   Total = 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n   Chests: [10] -> even -> Group0: 1, Group1:0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> Group0_keys:4, Group1_keys:0\n\n   For even chests: min(1,0)=0\n   For odd chests: min(0,4)=0\n   Total = 0 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints (n, m up to 10^5) so we are just counting, which is efficient.\n\n Code Implementation:\n\n Steps:\n   Read first line: n, m\n   Read second line: list of n integers for chests\n   Read third line: list of m integers for keys\n\n   Separate the chests into two lists (or just count) by parity.\n   Similarly for keys.\n\n   Then compute the two minimums and add them.\n\n But note: we don't need to store the entire lists, just counts.\n\n Let's do:\n\n  ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can be opened by a key only if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to specific parity conditions: an even-numbered chest must be paired with an odd-numbered key, and an odd-numbered chest must be paired with an even-numbered key. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Chests and Keys**: Separate the chests into two groups based on whether their numbers are even or odd. Similarly, separate the keys into two groups based on their parity.\n2. **Count Matching Pairs**: For even-numbered chests, the number of compatible keys is the count of odd-numbered keys. Conversely, for odd-numbered chests, the number of compatible keys is the count of even-numbered keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Openable Chests**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the count of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the count of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    odd_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chest += 1\n            \n    even_key = 0\n    odd_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key += 1\n            \n    ans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Categorizing Chests**: The chests are divided into two counts: `even_chest` for chests with even numbers and `odd_chest` for those with odd numbers.\n3. **Categorizing Keys**: Similarly, keys are divided into `even_key` (even numbers) and `odd_key` (odd numbers).\n4. **Calculating Result**: The result is computed by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys (since even chests require odd keys) and the minimum of odd chests and even keys (since odd chests require even keys). The sum of these two minima gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to determine valid key-chest pairs, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
