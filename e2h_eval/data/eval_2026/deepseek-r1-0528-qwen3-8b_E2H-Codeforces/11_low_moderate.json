A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. They have k bottles -> total drink = k * l milliliters.\n For a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. But note: the toasts are for the entire group? Actually, the problem says:\n \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. And they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\n\n However, note: the example calculation: \n   drink: 20 ml, and each toast requires 3 friends * nl (which is 1 ml per toast? because in the first sample: nl=1) -> wait, the input says: \n   Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n Explanation from example: \n   They have 3 friends, so for one toast, each friend needs 1 ml (nl=1) and 1 slice of lime (so for one toast, the whole group uses 3 slices? but wait, the example says: \n   \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" meaning that for one toast, each friend gets nl milliliters? Actually, let me read again:\n\n \"To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n This means: for one toast, the entire group (all n friends) would need n * nl milliliters of drink, and n * 1 slice of lime (but wait, the lime part: they have c limes, each cut into d slices -> total lime slices = c*d. And for one toast, how many lime slices? The problem says \"a slice of lime\", and since there are n friends, does that mean each friend gets one slice? Then for one toast, we need n slices.\n\n But wait, the example input: n=3, so for one toast, they need 3 slices (one per friend). Similarly, for salt: each toast requires np grams per friend? Then for one toast, the entire group uses n * np grams.\n\n However, looking at the example: \n   Input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\n   Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml. For one toast, the group needs 3 * 3 = 9 ml? But wait, the example says: \n        \"The friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n   So here, they are using 3 ml per toast? How?\n\n   Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for a toast. Since there are 3 friends, then one toast requires 3 * nl = 3 * 3 = 9 ml? But 20/9 is about 2.22, so 2 toasts? But the example says 6.\n\n   Correction: Actually, the example says: \n        \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" -> so if there are 3 friends, then for one toast, the drink needed is 3 * nl.\n\n   However, wait: in the example, nl is 3 (from the input). Then for one toast, the drink required is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. Then with 20 ml, we can do floor(20/9)=2 toasts. But the example says 6.\n\n   Alternatively, the example might be interpreting: \n        \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" per toast, and the entire group's drink requirement per toast is n * nl.\n\n   But then the example input: n=3, k=4, l=5, so total drink = 20 ml. Then the number of toasts by drink = 20 // (n * nl) = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2.\n\n   However, the example says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" \n\n   Wait, why divided by 3? \n\n   Let me check the example's explanation again: \n        \"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\n   Here, they are dividing by 3 (which is the number of friends) but not by n * nl? \n\n   Actually, note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for a toast. But wait, if each friend needs nl milliliters,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend in a group can make, given certain constraints on the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, and then determine how many toasts can be made per friend based on these resources.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can partake in, considering the available drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires:\n   - For drink: `nl` milliliters per friend, so the total drink needed per toast is `n * nl`.\n   - For lime slices: One slice per friend, so the total lime slices needed per toast is `n`.\n   - For salt: `np` grams per friend, so the total salt needed per toast is `n * np`.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The number of toasts is constrained by the most limited resource. We calculate the maximum possible toasts from each resource separately and then take the minimum of these values. This minimum value is then divided by the number of friends (since each friend must consume the same number of toasts) to get the answer.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves straightforward arithmetic operations to compute the total available resources and then determine the limiting factor. The steps are:\n   - Calculate the total drink available (`k * l`).\n   - Calculate the total lime slices available (`c * d`).\n   - Calculate the total salt available (`p`).\n   - Determine the number of toasts possible from each resource:\n     - Drink: `(k * l) // (n * nl)`\n     - Lime: `(c * d) // n`\n     - Salt: `p // (n * np)`\n   - The answer is the minimum of these three values, ensuring it is an integer by using floor division.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    total_salt = p\n    \n    drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n    salt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n    \n    ans = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers separated by spaces, which are read and parsed into variables.\n2. **Total Resources Calculation**: \n   - Total drink is calculated as `k * l`.\n   - Total lime slices is calculated as `c * d`.\n   - Total salt is directly given as `p`.\n3. **Toast Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The number of toasts possible based on drink is `total_drink // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The number of toasts based on lime slices is `total_lime_slices // n`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The number of toasts based on salt is `total_salt // (n * np)`.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimum of the three toast counts determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures that each friend can partake in the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limits.",
