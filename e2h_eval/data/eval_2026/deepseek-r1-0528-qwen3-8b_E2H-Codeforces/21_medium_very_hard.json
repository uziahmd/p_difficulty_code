The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j is odd. This means that one of the numbers must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys into two groups:\n   Chestes (a_i): \n        - Even chests (E_c): those with a_i % 2 == 0\n        - Odd chests (O_c): those with a_i % 2 == 1\n\n   Keys (b_j):\n        - Even keys (E_k): those with b_j % 2 == 0\n        - Odd keys (O_k): those with b_j % 2 == 1\n\n Now, note the matching condition:\n   An even chest can only be opened by an odd key (because even + odd = odd).\n   An odd chest can only be opened by an even key (because odd + even = odd).\n\n So, we have two independent bipartite matchings:\n\n   Matching 1: Even chests (E_c) must be matched with Odd keys (O_k)\n   Matching 2: Odd chests (O_c) must be matched with Even keys (E_k)\n\n However, we cannot use the same key twice. But note: the two sets of keys (even and odd) are disjoint.\n\n The problem then reduces to:\n\n   Let E_c = number of even chests\n   Let O_c = number of odd chests\n   Let E_k = number of even keys\n   Let O_k = number of odd keys\n\n Then, the maximum number of chests we can open is limited by:\n\n   For even chests: we can open at most min(E_c, O_k) chests.\n   For odd chests: we can open at most min(O_c, E_k) chests.\n\n But wait: is that independent? Yes, because the keys used for even chests are the odd ones and for odd chests are the even ones.\n\n However, note that the total keys available in each category is fixed. So the total chests opened is:\n\n   total = min(E_c, O_k) + min(O_c, E_k)\n\n Let's test with the examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd\n        14 -> even\n        6 -> even\n        2 -> even\n        11 -> odd\n\n        E_c = 3, O_c = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8 -> even\n        4 -> even\n        7 -> odd\n        20 -> even\n\n        E_k = 3, O_k = 1\n\n   Then: \n        even chests can be opened by odd keys: min(3, 1) = 1\n        odd chests can be opened by even keys: min(2, 3) = 2\n        total = 3.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=5, m=1, chests = [2,4,6,8,10], keys = [5]\n\n   Chests: all even -> E_c = 5, O_c = 0\n   Keys: [5] -> odd -> O_k = 1, E_k = 0\n\n   Then: \n        even chests: min(5,1)=1\n        odd chests: min(0,0)=0\n        total = 1.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: n=1, m=4, chests=[10], keys=[20,30,40,50]\n\n   Chests: [10] -> even -> E_c=1, O_c=0\n   Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> E_k=4, O_k=0\n\n   Then: \n        even chests: min(1,0)=0\n        odd chests: min(0,4)=0\n        total=0.\n\n However, wait: what if we have a chest that is even and we have no odd keys? Then we cannot open it. Similarly for odd.\n\n But note: the example 3: chest 10 (even) requires an odd key, but there are none. So 0.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m.\n   Step 2: Read the list of chests and split into even and odd counts.\n   Step 3: Read the list of keys and split into even and odd counts.\n\n   Then, result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n But wait, is there any constraint that we cannot use more than the available keys? \n\n   In our breakdown, we are using at most min(even_chests, odd_keys) from the odd_keys and min(odd_chests, even_keys) from the even_keys.\n\n   Since the two sets of keys (even and odd) are distinct, we are not double-counting.\n\n However, let me consider another scenario: \n\n   Suppose we have:\n        Chests: [even, odd, even, odd] -> E_c=2, O_c=2\n        Keys: [odd, even, odd, even] -> O_k=2, E_k=2\n\n   Then:\n        even_chests (2) can be matched with odd_keys (2) -> 2 matches (using 2 odd keys)\n        odd_chests (2) can be matched with even_keys (2) -> 2 matches (using 2 even keys)\n\n   Total 4, which is correct.\n\n But note: the keys are distinct and we are using two different sets.\n\n However, wait: the problem says one key can be used at most once, and we are not mixing the two sets. So this is correct.\n\n But note: the problem does not require matching the exact pairs, just that the condition holds. And since the condition for even chests is odd keys and for odd chests is even keys, we don't need to worry about the actual values beyond parity.\n\n However, there is a catch: the condition is based on the sum being odd. The above reasoning by parity is sufficient because:\n\n   If a chest is even, then we require an odd key (because even + odd = odd). Similarly, if a chest is odd, we require an even key.\n\n Therefore, the solution is as above.\n\n But wait: what if the numbers are very large? The modulus operation is safe for integers up to 10^9.\n\n Code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the input has two integers n and m, then two lists of n and m integers.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n Example from the problem: \n   Example 1: ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20'] -> output 3.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read first line: n, m\n   Second line: list of n integers for chests\n   Third line: list of m integers for keys\n\n   Then count:\n        even_chest = count of x in chests where x % 2 == 0\n        odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n        even_key = count of x in keys where x % 2 == 0\n        odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   Then result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\n   Print result.\n\n Let's test with provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        even_chest = 3, odd_chest = 2\n        even_key = 3, odd_key = 1\n        result = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n Example 2:\n        Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_chest=5, odd_chest=0\n        Keys: [5] -> even_key=0, odd_key=1\n        result = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n Example 3:\n        Chests: [10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n        Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_key=4, odd_key=0\n        result = min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0 = 0.\n\n But wait, example 3: the chest is even, so we need an odd key. There are none -> 0.\n\n However, note: what if we have a chest that is even and a key that is odd? Then we can use it. But if we have multiple, we are limited by the minimum.\n\n This solution seems to work.\n\n But wait, what if the condition is not just about parity? The problem states: \"the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number\", i.e., a_i + b_j ≡ 1 (mod 2). \n\n Our method uses the fact that the sum is odd if and only if one is even and the other odd. That is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem does not say that the key must be of a specific parity relative to the chest beyond the condition of odd sum. But the condition is purely determined by parity.\n\n Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n But wait: the problem constraints are up to 10^5 elements. Counting the even/odd is linear and efficient.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation for negative numbers? The problem states that the numbers are at least 1, so positive. So we can use % 2.\n\n Code:\n\n   import sys\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n   # The first two tokens are n and m\n   n = int(data[0])\n   m = int(data[1])\n\n   # Next n tokens are the chests\n   chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n   # Next m tokens are the keys\n   keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n\n   even_chest = 0\n   for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n\n   odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n   even_key = 0\n   for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n\n   odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   ans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\n   print(ans)\n\n But wait, let me test with the sample inputs.\n\n Sample 1: \n   n=5, m=4, chests=[9,14,6,2,11], keys=[8,4,7,20]\n\n   even_chest: \n        9: odd -> skip\n        14: even -> count=1\n        6: even -> 2\n        2: even -> 3\n        11: odd -> skip -> even_chest=3, odd_chest=2.\n\n   keys: \n        8: even -> count=1\n        4: even -> 2\n        7: odd -> skip\n        20: even -> 3 -> even_key=3, odd_key=1.\n\n   ans = min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1+2=3.\n\n It matches.\n\n However, note: the problem statement example 1 says 3.\n\n But wait, the example 2: \n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n   n=5, m=1, chests=[2,4,6,8,10] -> even_chest=5, odd_chest=0.\n   keys=[5] -> even_key=0, odd_key=1.\n\n   ans = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n Example 3: \n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n   n=1, m=4, chests=[10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0.\n   keys=[20,30,40,50] -> even_key=4, odd_key=0.\n\n   ans = min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0 = 0.\n\n Therefore, we output the answers as expected.\n\n However, wait: what if we have a chest that is even and a key that is even? Then even+even is even, so condition fails. Similarly, odd+odd is even, condition fails.\n\n Our method only uses the opposite parity, so we are safe.\n\n One more edge: n=0 or m=0.\n\n   If n=0, then even_chest=0, odd_chest=0, then we get 0.\n\n   Similarly, if m=0, then even_key=0, odd_key=0, then we get 0.\n\n So the code handles that.\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n But note: the example input is given as a string in the example, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n We assume the input format as described.\n\n However, the example input is provided in the problem as:\n\n   ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n But wait, these are strings. In the competition, the input comes from stdin.\n\n The code above reads from stdin.\n\n But note: the example input is given in the problem as a list of strings. In reality, we read from stdin.\n\n I think we are good.\n\n However, note: the example input has spaces and newlines. The `split()` will break by any whitespace.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as a string that includes the entire input. In practice, we would read from stdin.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But note: the problem says the input is from standard input.\n\n We'll use:\n\n   import sys\n   data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n This will read all tokens. Then we take the first two as n and m.\n\n However, the input might have multiple lines. But `split()` without arguments splits by any whitespace and ignores leading/trailing spaces.\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n Let me test with the example string:\n\n   s = \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n   tokens = s.split() -> ['5','4','9','14','6','2','11','8','4','7','20']\n\n   Then n=5, m=4, chests = [9,14,6,2,11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n Correct.\n\n So the code is:\n\n   import sys\n\n   def main():\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        if not data:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n        n = int(data[0])\n        m = int(data[1])\n\n        chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n        keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n\n        even_chest = 0\n        for num in chests:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_chest += 1\n\n        odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n        even_key = 0\n        for num in keys:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_key += 1\n\n        odd_key = m - even_key\n\n        ans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n        print(ans)\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n        main()\n\n However, we can do this without loops by using list comprehensions and the built-in `sum` function, but the problem size is up to 10^5, and the modulus operation is cheap. But we can also use:\n\n   even_chest = sum(1 for num in chests if num % 2 == 0)\n\n But the above loop is clear.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   even_chest = sum(1 for num in chests if num % 2 == 0)\n\n But note: the problem constraints say up to 10^5, so both methods are acceptable.\n\n Let me use the more concise version.\n\n Revised code:\n\n   import sys\n\n   def main():\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        if not data:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n        n = int(data[0])\n        m = int(data[1])\n        chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n        keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n\n        even_chest = sum(1 for num in chests if num % 2 == 0)\n        odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n        even_key = sum(1 for num in keys if num % 2 == 0)\n        odd_key = m - even_key\n\n        ans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n        print(ans)\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n        main()\n\n But wait: the performance of `sum(1 for ...)` is O(n). It's acceptable for 10^5.\n\n However, we can also use:\n\n   even_chest = len([x for x in chests if x % 2 == 0])\n\n But the `sum` with a generator is efficient.\n\n Let me stick with the `sum` method.\n\n But note: the problem constraints are high, but the modulus operation is constant time per element.\n\n This should be efficient.\n\n Let me submit the code.\n\n However, wait: there is a possibility that the input might be large, but the modulus operation is O(1) and we are doing two passes (one for chests, one for keys). \n\n This is acceptable.\n\n But note: the problem says n, m up to 10^5, so two passes (each 10^5) is acceptable.\n\n Final code:\n\n   import sys\n\n   def main():\n        data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n        if not data:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n        n = int(data[0])\n        m = int(data[1])\n        chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n        keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n\n        even_chest = sum(1 for num in chests if num % 2 == 0)\n        odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n        even_key = sum(1 for num in keys if num % 2 == 0)\n        odd_key = m - even_key\n\n        ans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n        print(ans)\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n        main()\n\n But wait: what if the input is provided in a file? The `sys.stdin.read()` will read from stdin.\n\n This is standard.\n\n Let me run the sample tests.\n\n Sample 1: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Output: 3\n\n Sample 2:\n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n\n   Output: 1\n\n Sample 3:\n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n\n   Output: 0\n\n All correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says the numbers can be up to 10^9, but modulus 2 is safe.\n\n We are good.\n\n But wait: what if the numbers are negative? The problem states: \"1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^9\", so non-negative. So no issue.\n\n Final code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key insight is that a chest can be opened by a key only if the sum of their numbers is odd. This condition translates to one being even and the other being odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each chest is opened by exactly one key, and each key is used at most once. The condition for a valid match is that the sum of the chest's number and the key's number must be odd, which means one must be even and the other odd.\n2. **Intuition**: By categorizing chests and keys into even and odd groups, we can independently count the maximum possible matches between even chests and odd keys, and between odd chests and even keys. The solution involves counting these categories and then determining the maximum matches possible in each category.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Count the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Count the number of even and odd keys.\n   - The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each chest and key exactly once to count their parities, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = sum(1 for num in chests if num % 2 == 0)\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = sum(1 for num in keys if num % 2 == 0)\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    ans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Categories**: The code counts how many chests are even and how many are odd, and similarly for the keys.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys for one scenario, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys for the other scenario. The sum of these two minima gives the total number of chests that can be opened.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests Neko can open under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to maximize the number of valid matches without explicitly pairing each chest with a key, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
