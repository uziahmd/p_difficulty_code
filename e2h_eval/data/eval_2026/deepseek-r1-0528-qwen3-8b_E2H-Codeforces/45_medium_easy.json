There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^18) and we need to compute the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, the total number of games is fixed (n-1). But note: the winner must win all his/her games.\n\n However, the constraint is on the rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n We are to maximize the number of games for the winner.\n\n Let's think about how the tournament can be structured:\n\n Example:\n   n=2: winner plays 1 game.\n   n=3: winner plays 2 games? But note: the example output says 2 for n=3.\n\n   However, the example says for n=4 the answer is 2.\n\n Why for n=4 the answer is 2?\n   One way: \n        Round 1: (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4)\n        Then the winner of round 1 (say player1) vs winner of round 3 (say player3) -> then the winner (player1) has played 2 games.\n\n   But why not 3? Because to have 3 wins, the winner would have to beat 3 opponents. However, the rule says that the next opponent must have played either the same or one more game than the current number of games the winner has.\n\n   After two wins, the winner has played 2 games. Then to play a third game, he would need an opponent that has played either 1, 2, or 3 games. But in a knockout with 4 players, there are no more than 2 games played by any other player (the other two lost their first game). So the next opponent hasn't played any (if we try to arrange differently) but that's a difference of 2 (2 vs 0) which violates the rule.\n\n Alternate arrangement for n=4:\n\n   We cannot have:\n        Game1: 1 vs 2 -> both have 0, then 1 wins (now 1 has 1 game)\n        Game2: 1 vs 3 -> now 1 has 1, 3 has 0 -> difference is 1 -> allowed? yes, then 1 wins (now 1 has 2 games)\n        Now we have two other players: 4. But 4 hasn't played. Now, we cannot have 1 vs 4 because 4 has 0 and 1 has 2 -> difference 2, not allowed.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try:\n\n        First, we must have two games in the first round (if we don't, then the structure is different). The rule doesn't force us to do it in rounds, but the condition applies to every match.\n\n   Actually, the problem allows any ordering as long as the condition holds. But note: the tournament is knockout, so once you lose you are out.\n\n   We want the winner to play as many games as possible.\n\n   Let k be the number of games the winner plays. Then the winner must defeat k opponents. The opponents themselves must have won some games (and then lost to the winner). But also, the matches must satisfy the condition.\n\n   How to model?\n\n   Consider: the entire tournament forms a binary tree (or a more general tree) but the condition is that the winner's subtree must be built in such a way that when the winner faces an opponent, that opponent has played at most one game less (if the winner has played k-1 games, then the opponent must have played either k-2, k-1, or k games). However, since the opponent is the winner of a sub-tournament, we can consider the structure.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use recursion:\n\n   Let f(x) be the maximum number of wins a player can get in a tournament starting with x players (with the given rule).\n\n   However, note: the entire tournament is fixed to have n players, and we are only concerned with the path of the winner.\n\n   Another idea: we can think of the tournament as having two halves (like a balanced binary tree) but the rule allows for a more flexible structure.\n\n   Actually, the problem is equivalent to building a \"tournament\" (knockout) where the winner must face opponents that have been accumulating wins under the constraint. We can represent the tournament as a sequence of rounds, but the constraint might let us have multiple rounds at the same \"level\".\n\n   Let's define:\n\n      Let k be the total wins for the winner.\n\n      Then the winner must have played k games.\n\n      The k opponents the winner defeats must have been the winners of k subtrees. In each of these subtrees, the root (the opponent) must have played some games. But note: the opponent must have a number of games (wins) that is either k-1 (if they just advanced from the previous round) or k-2 (if they had to wait for a bye or something) but actually the rule applies to every match.\n\n   However, the rule says: two players can play if the number of games they have played so far (i.e., the number of wins) differ by at most one.\n\n   Therefore, when the winner (who has k-1 wins) is about to play an opponent, the opponent must have between k-2 and k wins (inclusive). But wait, the winner has k-1 wins, so the opponent must have at least k-2 and at most k.\n\n   But note: the opponent has been winning some games. The minimum number of wins the opponent can have is 0 (if they just started) and maximum is k-1 (if they have been in the same level). However, the condition is that the difference is at most one. So the opponent must have at least k-2 and at most k? Actually, the condition is |a - b| <= 1, so if the winner has k-1, then the opponent must have k-2, k-1, or k.\n\n   But in our scenario, the opponent is the winner of a subtree. How many wins does the opponent have? The opponent must have won all the games in their subtree. And the size of the subtree is the number of players in that branch. However, the opponent's wins are exactly the number of games they played to become the root of that subtree.\n\n   Now, the entire tournament has n players. The winner must have beaten k opponents, and each opponent must have come from a subtree of size s_i (so that the total players is 1 + sum_i s_i = n). But note: the winner's own games are k, and the total players is the sum of the sizes of the k subtrees (each opponent's subtree) plus the winner (the root). However, the subtrees might have been built independently, so the entire tournament is a full binary tree with k leaves? Actually, no: the entire tournament has n leaves (players) and the root is the winner.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n      Let F(k) be the minimum number of players required for the winner to have k wins (i.e., the entire tournament has F(k) players) under the rule.\n\n      How to build F(k)?\n\n      The winner must have k wins. To get the first win, we need at least 2 players (so F(1)=2).\n\n      For the second win, the winner must have beaten two opponents. Each opponent must have come from a tournament of their own. However, the rule requires that the two opponents must have at most one difference in the number of games they have played.\n\n      But note: the two opponents are independent. However, the condition for the final match: the winner has 1 win, so the two opponents must have 0 or 1 win.\n\n      But wait: the opponent that is defeated in the final must have won at least one game (to get to the final). However, the condition for the final match: the winner has 1 win, and the opponent must have 1 win (because if the opponent has 0 wins, then the difference is 1 -> allowed; if the opponent has 2 wins, then the difference is 1 (from 1 to 2) is allowed? Actually, wait: the rule says \"two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one\". So if the winner has 1 and the opponent has 1: okay. If the winner has 1 and the opponent has 0: okay. If the winner has 1 and the opponent has 2: okay.\n\n      However, to get an opponent with 2 wins, that opponent must have won two games. That means that the subtree for that opponent must have at least 3 players (since the opponent beats two others). Similarly, the other opponent (if we are going to have two wins for the winner) could be from a subtree of 2 players (then that opponent has 1 win) or 3 players (then that opponent has 2 wins) or even 4 players (then that opponent has 3 wins? but wait, the condition for the final match: the winner has 1 win, and if the opponent has 3 wins, then the difference is 2 -> not allowed).\n\n      Therefore, the two opponents must have at most 1 win (since the winner has 1 win, and the opponent can have 0 or 1 or 2? But 2 is allowed, but then the opponent must have 2 wins, meaning the subtree for that opponent must have at least 3 players. But then the total players would be: the winner (1) + the two subtrees (size s1 and s2). The minimum total players for k=2 is:\n\n        Option 1: both opponents have 1 win: then each subtree has at least 2 players. So total = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n        Option 2: one opponent has 0 wins (subtree of 1 player? but wait, a single player doesn't play any game, but then the opponent has 0 wins, but then the opponent must have been sitting out? Actually, no: the tournament is knockout, so every player must play until they lose. But note: the problem doesn't specify that byes are allowed. However, the rule doesn't explicitly forbid byes? \n\n      But note: the input n is at least 2, and the tournament must be arranged for n players.\n\n      Let me reexamine the example n=3:\n\n        Input: 3 -> Output: 2.\n\n        How? \n          The winner must play 2 games. That means the winner defeats two opponents. But there are only 3 players. The two opponents must be the other two. However, the two opponents cannot meet because the winner must face them one by one.\n\n        The arrangement: \n          First, two matches? But there are only 3 players. Actually, we can have:\n\n          Round 1: One match (player1 vs player2) -> winner (say player1) and player3 sits out.\n          Then, Round 2: player1 vs player3.\n\n        Now, check the condition for the second match: \n          Before the second match, player1 has 1 win, and player3 has 0 wins. The difference is 1 -> allowed.\n\n        So the condition allows for byes (i.e., some players not playing in earlier rounds). Therefore, the tournament grid can be designed arbitrarily as long as the condition holds.\n\n      Therefore, we can model the entire tournament as:\n\n        The winner will have k wins. Then the k opponents must have been accumulated from subtrees. The minimal total number of players required for the winner to have k wins is:\n\n          F(1) = 2\n          F(2) = ?\n\n        For k=2: the winner must have two wins. The two opponents must have at most 2 wins (but in the first win, the opponent must have at most 1 win, and in the second win, the opponent must have at most 2 wins). However, we can also consider:\n\n          Let the winner start with 0 wins. Then he must first play an opponent who has either 0 or 1 win.\n\n          But wait, how did the opponent get wins? The opponent must have won the games in his own subtree.\n\n        We can define F(k) as the minimal number of players needed so that the winner has k wins.\n\n        Then:\n\n          F(1) = 2\n\n          For k>=2, the winner must have k wins, so he must have beaten k opponents. Each opponent must have been the winner of a subtree. The condition for the last match (the k-th win) is that the opponent must have between k-2 and k wins (if the winner has k-1 wins, then the opponent must have k-2, k-1, or k wins). But note: the opponent's wins are the number of wins they have, and we can choose the subtrees arbitrarily as long as the condition is satisfied for every match.\n\n        However, we want the minimal n for a given k, but actually we are given n and we want the maximum k such that there exists a tournament with n players and the winner has k wins.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the maximum k for which the minimal number of players required to have k wins is <= n.\n\n        How to compute F(k)? \n\n        We can use recursion:\n\n        Let F(0) = 1 (a player with 0 wins, i.e., the root without any game, but then we start the tournament)\n\n        Actually, we don't need F(0). We need the minimal number of players for a winner to have k wins.\n\n        The process:\n\n          To have k wins, the winner must have k matches. The k-th match (the last one) is against an opponent that has a certain number of wins, say x (which must be between k-2 and k). But we want the minimal total players.\n\n        However, note: the entire tournament is built from the winner and the k opponents, and each opponent is the root of a subtree. The minimal way to build a subtree that produces an opponent with x wins is F(x). But wait, the minimal number of players in the subtree for the opponent is F(x). However, we are free to choose the structure as long as the condition holds.\n\n        But note: the condition must hold in every match, including the matches that built the opponent's record. However, we are only concerned with the minimal total players.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n          The entire tournament is a complete binary tree? Not necessarily, because we can have byes.\n\n        Actually, we can define:\n\n          Let g(k) be the minimal number of players needed to have a tournament where the winner has k wins.\n\n          Then, to achieve k wins, the winner must have beaten k opponents. Each opponent must have been produced by a subtree. The condition for the k-th match is that the opponent must have between k-2 and k wins (if the winner has k-1 wins). But we are free to choose the wins of the opponents from the previous matches arbitrarily as long as the condition holds in the entire process.\n\n        However, to minimize the total players, we would want to minimize the size of each subtree.\n\n        In fact, the minimal way is to have the opponent for the k-th match as the one with the minimal required wins. But note: the entire process must satisfy the condition for every match.\n\n        We can break the tournament into two parts: the winner and the k opponents. Each opponent comes from a subtree of minimal size F(i) for i wins, but then the condition must hold for the match between the winner and the opponent.\n\n        Actually, we can use a recurrence that considers the two largest subtrees (because the condition requires that the opponents have wins close to the winner's wins). \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following known approach for similar problems (like tennis championship, CodeForces):\n\n          We note that the tournament is structured in rounds, but the rounds are not necessarily balanced. The key is to use a greedy grouping.\n\n        Known solution from CodeForces (problem Tennis Championship): \n\n          We can use the following recurrence:\n\n          Let dp[k] be the minimal number of players needed to have a winner with k wins.\n\n          Then, the winner must have two types of opponents: those that are used to fill the k wins. We can consider:\n\n            dp[0] = 1   [the winner without any win]\n\n            For k>=1, the winner must have at least one win. Then, the minimal configuration is:\n\n            We can use a greedy: the winner must have beaten one opponent (so one win) and then the rest of the wins (k-1) can be distributed arbitrarily, but the condition requires that the opponent for the k-th win must have at least k-2 wins (if the winner has k-1 wins). \n\n          However, note the condition: the opponent must have at least k-2 wins (if the winner has k-1 wins) and at most k wins.\n\n          But to minimize the total players, we would take the minimal subtrees for the opponents.\n\n          The minimal configuration for k wins is:\n\n            The winner must have two kinds of wins: \n              Some opponents are from subtrees that produce a winner with k-1 wins (so that the difference is 0) and some with k-2 wins (difference 1) and possibly k wins (difference 1) but k wins would require a bigger subtree.\n\n          However, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n            dp[1] = 2\n\n            For k>=2, the winner must have beaten k opponents. The minimal total players is the sum of the minimal subtrees for these k opponents. But note: the k opponents must have wins that are k-1 (the last match) and the rest must be built in a way that the condition holds.\n\n          Actually, we can use the following:\n\n            Let dp[k] = 2 * dp[k-1]   (if we use balanced subtrees) but that is not minimal.\n\n          There is a known combinatorial structure: the problem is similar to \"The minimum number of players to have a tournament that requires k wins\" and the answer is the smallest m such that the number of players is m and the winner has k wins.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a greedy iterative method:\n\n            We know that the winner must have k wins. Then the tournament must have at least k+1 players (since the winner and k opponents). But that is too low.\n\n          Actually, the minimal number of players for k wins is:\n\n            Let m(0) = 1, m(1)=2, and for k>=2:\n\n            m(k) = m(k-1) + m(k-2)\n\n          But wait, that gives Fibonacci numbers. Let's test:\n\n            k=0: m0 = 1\n            k=1: m1 = 2\n            k=2: m2 = 2 + 1 = 3 -> but we saw for k=2, n=3 is the minimal? Actually, with 3 players we can have the winner with 2 wins.\n\n          However, our example: n=3 -> k=2. So the minimal n for k wins is the (k+1)-th Fibonacci-like number (with base cases F0=1, F1=2, F2=3, F3=5, etc.). \n\n          Then, the problem reduces to: given n, find the maximum k such that F_k <= n, where F_k is defined by:\n\n            F_0 = 1\n            F_1 = 2\n            F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2} for k>=2.\n\n          Then, the answer is k (the number of wins).\n\n          Example:\n\n            n=2: F0=1<=2, F1=2<=2, F2=3>2 -> so k=1 -> answer=1. Correct.\n\n            n=3: F0=1<=3, F1=2<=3, F2=3<=3, F3=5>3 -> so k=2 -> answer=2. Correct.\n\n            n=4: F0=1<=4, F1=2<=4, F2=3<=4, F3=5>4 -> k=2 -> answer=2. Correct.\n\n            n=10: F0=1<=10, F1=2<=10, F2=3<=10, F3=5<=10, F4=8<=10, F5=13>10 -> k=4 -> answer=4. Correct.\n\n          But wait, the example input ['10'] gives output '4'. So yes.\n\n          However, let's verify with k=4 (4 wins) and n=10.\n\n          The minimal n for k=4 is F4=8, which is <=10, so the winner can have 4 wins. Then what is the structure?\n\n          The recurrence F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2} is the Fibonacci sequence shifted. This is because the winner must have two opponents: one from a subtree that requires F_{k-1} players and one from a subtree that requires F_{k-2} players? Actually, no: the condition requires that the opponents for the k-th win must have at most k wins (so the difference is 1). But the minimal way is to use the two smallest subtrees that satisfy the condition.\n\n          However, the known solution for the tennis championship problem (CodeForces) is indeed to use the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Read n (which can be up to 10^18)\n\n            We need to find the maximum k such that F_k <= n, where F_0=1, F_1=2, and F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2} for k>=2.\n\n            Then print k.\n\n          But note: the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so we can iterate until we exceed n. Since n can be up to 10^18, the k will be at most about 100 (because Fibonacci grows as fast as the golden ratio, so around 100 terms will exceed 10^18).\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n            a, b = 1, 2   # F0=1, F1=2\n            count = 0      # because we start with k=0: F0=1, then k=1: F1=2, then k=2: F2=3, etc.\n\n            Then we traverse while a <= n:\n\n                count += 1\n                a, b = b, a+b\n\n            But wait, we need to count the index. Actually, we start:\n\n                k0: a=1 -> count=0 (we haven't counted yet, but we are counting the k value that we can achieve)\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                fib0 = 1\n                fib1 = 2\n                k = 0   # meaning 0 wins requires 1 player (but we don't have that in our problem, the minimum is 2 players for 1 win)\n\n            Actually, the problem states: n>=2.\n\n            We want to find the maximum k such that fib_k <= n.\n\n            We can generate the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n, and then the last k for which fib_k <= n is the answer.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                fib = [1, 2]\n                k = 1   # because fib[0]=1 (0 wins) and fib[1]=2 (1 win)\n\n                Then we extend the list until the next Fibonacci number exceeds n.\n\n                Then the answer is the index (k) of the last Fibonacci number <= n.\n\n            But note: the definition:\n\n                k=0 -> 1 player (base case, but we don't use 0 wins for the winner because the tournament must have at least one win for the winner to be declared? Actually, the winner must win at least one game to be the winner, unless there is only one player. But n>=2, so the winner must win at least one game.\n\n            However, in our sequence:\n\n                k=0: 1 player -> not applicable (n>=2)\n                k=1: 2 players -> valid.\n\n            So we are interested in k from 1 upwards.\n\n            We can generate:\n\n                Let k = 1, then fib1 = 2\n                Then k=2: fib2 = 2+1 = 3\n                Then k=3: fib3 = 2+3 = 5? Wait, no: the recurrence is F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}. So:\n\n                    k=0: F0=1\n                    k=1: F1=2\n                    k=2: F2 = F1+F0 = 2+1=3\n                    k=3: F3 = F2+F1 = 3+2=5\n                    k=4: F4 = 5+3=8\n                    k=5: F5=13, etc.\n\n            So we are storing the Fibonacci sequence as:\n\n                fib[0] = 1\n                fib[1] = 2\n                fib[2] = 3\n                fib[3] = 5\n                fib[4] = 8\n\n            Then the maximum k (number of wins) is the index of the last Fibonacci number <= n.\n\n            But note: the Fibonacci number at index k is the minimal number of players for a winner to have k wins.\n\n            Therefore, we need to find the maximum k such that fib[k] <= n.\n\n            However, note: the example n=3: \n                fib0=1<=3 -> k=0 is valid (but we don't care about k=0 for the winner, because the winner must have at least one win? Actually, the problem states the winner must win all his games. The minimal win is 1.\n\n            But our k is the number of wins. So the answer for n=3 is k=2 (because fib2=3<=3, and fib3=5>3).\n\n            However, note: the Fibonacci index k corresponds to the number of wins. So:\n\n                k=1: 1 win -> fib1=2\n                k=2: 2 wins -> fib2=3\n\n            So the answer is k (the index).\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Let a = 1   (F0)\n                Let b = 2   (F1)\n                Let k = 1   (meaning we have achieved 1 win with 2 players)\n\n                Then we want to go further until we exceed n.\n\n                But note: the Fibonacci sequence we are generating:\n\n                    term0: a=1 (k0)\n                    term1: b=2 (k1)\n\n                Then we update:\n\n                    next = a + b\n                    k = 2\n                    then set a = b, b = next\n\n                Then we continue.\n\n            However, we need to count the number of wins (k) that the winner can have, which is the index.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                count = 1   # because we have at least k=1 (with 2 players)\n                a, b = 1, 2\n\n                while b <= n:\n                    # We are currently at k = count (which is the index of the current b, which is the (count)th Fibonacci number)\n                    # But note: we start with count=1 for b=2 (k=1)\n                    # Then we update: next = a+b, then set a=b, b=next, and then count++.\n\n                However, we are missing the initial state.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                fib0 = 1\n                fib1 = 2\n                k = 1   # because fib1=2 is the minimal for 1 win.\n\n                Then we want to generate fib2, fib3, ... until we exceed n.\n\n            But note: the problem asks for the maximum number of wins (k) such that the minimal n (fib_k) is <= the given n.\n\n            We can generate the Fibonacci sequence until the value exceeds n, and then the last k is the answer.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                a, b = 1, 1   -> wait, no: we have two base cases: 1 and 2.\n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                a = 1   (for k=0)\n                b = 2   (for k=1)\n\n                Then we start the loop for k>=2.\n\n                Let k = 1   (meaning we are at the first win)\n\n                Then we do:\n\n                while b <= n:\n                    print(k)   # but we are updating k and b together.\n\n                Actually, we want to count the maximum k.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                count = 0\n                a, b = 1, 2\n                while a <= n:\n                    count += 1\n                    a, b = b, a+b\n\n                Then the answer is count-1? \n\n                Let's test with n=2:\n\n                    Initially: a=1, b=2, count=0.\n                    Loop: a=1<=2 -> count=1, then a becomes 2, b becomes 3.\n                    Then check: a=2<=2 -> count=2, then a becomes 3, b becomes 5.\n                    Then 3<=2? no -> break. Then we output count-1? -> 1. Correct.\n\n                Alternatively, we can count the index.\n\n                Actually, the above loop counts the number of Fibonacci numbers (including k=0) that are <= n.\n\n                But note: we are interested in the index (k) of the last Fibonacci number <= n.\n\n                However, the Fibonacci sequence we generated:\n\n                    Step0: a=1 (k=0) -> then we update to (b, a+b) = (2,3) and count becomes 1 (meaning we've seen one Fibonacci number, which is k=0, but then we update and then check the next one?).\n\n                Actually, we are counting the number of terms (starting from k0) that are <= n. Then the maximum k is the count-1 (because k0 is 0, k1 is 1, etc.)?\n\n                But wait, we want the maximum k (number of wins) such that the minimal n (Fibonacci number) is <= n.\n\n                The k is the index (starting at 0 for the first term). But the number of wins is the index. \n\n                Example: \n                    n=2: \n                        k0: 1<=2 -> count=1, then k1: 2<=2 -> count=2, then k2: 3>2 -> stop.\n                        Then the maximum k is 1 (because the Fibonacci number for k=1 is 2, and for k=2 is 3 which is >2). So we output 1.\n\n                But note: the Fibonacci number at index k is the minimal n for k wins.\n\n                Therefore, the answer is the maximum k such that F_k <= n.\n\n                We are counting the number of Fibonacci numbers (including k0) that are <= n, and then subtract 1 (because the last one that was <=n is the one we want, but we are counting the count as the number of terms we have processed including the update). \n\n                Actually, the code above:\n\n                    count = 0\n                    a, b = 1, 2\n                    while a <= n:\n                        count += 1\n                        a, b = b, a+b\n\n                Then the answer is count-1.\n\n                Let me test:\n\n                    n=2: \n                        a=1 -> count=1, then a becomes 2, b becomes 3.\n                        then a=2<=2 -> count=2, then a becomes 3, b becomes 5.\n                        then 3<=2 -> false, break. Then answer = 2-1 = 1. Correct.\n\n                    n=3:\n                        a=1 -> count=1, then a=2, b=3\n                        a=2<=3 -> count=2, then a=3, b=5\n                        a=3<=3 -> count=3, then a=5, b=8\n                        then 5<=3 -> false, break.

Then answer=3-1=2. Correct.\n\n                    n=10:\n                        a=1 -> count=1, a=2, b=3\n                        a=2<=10 -> count=2, a=3, b=5\n                        a=3<=10 -> count=3, a=5, b=8\n                        a=5<=10 -> count=4, a=8, b=13\n                        a=8<=10 -> count=5, a=13, b=21\n                        a=13<=10 -> false, break. Then answer=5-1=4. Correct.\n\n                However, note: the Fibonacci numbers are:\n\n                    k0: 1\n                    k1: 2\n                    k2: 3\n                    k3: 5\n                    k4: 8\n                    k5: 13\n\n                So the count is the number of Fibonacci numbers (from k0 to k4) that are <=10, which is 5. Then we subtract 1 to get the index of the last one (k4) as 4.\n\n                But wait, the last one (k4) is 8, which is <=10, and k5=13 is not. So the maximum k is 4.\n\n                Therefore, the answer is count-1.\n\n            However, note: the problem says the winner must win all his games. The minimal n for k wins is F_k. The maximum k is the maximum index such that F_k <= n.\n\n            We can also note that the Fibonacci sequence we are using is:\n\n                F0 = 1\n                F1 = 2\n                F2 = F1+F0 = 3\n                F3 = F2+F1 = 5\n                F4 = F3+F2 = 8\n                ...\n\n            And the number of wins is k (for F_k).\n\n            Therefore, the code:\n\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a, b = 1, 2\n                count = 0\n                while a <= n:\n                    count += 1\n                    a, b = b, a+b\n\n                print(count-1)\n\n            But wait, the initial a=1 is F0, then we update to b=2 (which is F1) and then we check a<=n again.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                count = 0\n                a, b = 1, 2\n                while True:\n                    if a > n:\n                        break\n                    count += 1\n                    a, b = b, a+b\n\n                print(count-1)\n\n            But this is the same.\n\n            However, we must consider the performance: n up to 10^18, and the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so the while loop runs about O(log_phi(n)) times (about 100 iterations).\n\n            This is efficient.\n\n        Let me test with n=10**18.\n\n            We can run the code and see how many iterations: \n                The Fibonacci numbers grow as fast as (golden ratio)^k, so k ~ log_phi(10^18) is about 90.\n\n            So it's safe.\n\n        But wait: the above code counts the number of Fibonacci numbers (including k0) that are <= n, and then subtracts 1. \n\n        However, note: the Fibonacci numbers we are generating are:\n\n            term0: 1\n            term1: 2\n            term2: 3\n            term3: 5\n            ...\n\n        The count variable counts the number of terms (from term0 to term_{count-1}) that are <= n.\n\n        Then the maximum k (index) is count-1.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is count-1.\n\n        But wait, in the example n=2: \n            term0: 1<=2 -> count=1\n            term1: 2<=2 -> count=2\n            term2: 3>2 -> break, then answer=1.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem's example input n=2, output=1.\n\n        But wait, the example input n=10, output=4.\n\n        Therefore, we output count-1.\n\n        But note: the problem says the winner's number of games is the number of wins. So we are returning k (the index) which is the number of wins.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, wait: the example input n=10 gives 4 wins. But the example output for n=10 is 4.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        But wait, the example input n=3 gives 2 wins. The example output for n=3 is 2.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a, b = 1, 2\n            count = 0\n            while a <= n:\n                count += 1\n                a, b = b, a+b\n\n            print(count-1)\n\n        However, wait: in the while condition, we are checking the old 'a' (the Fibonacci number for the current index) and then updating. This counts the term0 (a=1) at the beginning.\n\n        But note: the minimal n for k wins is F_k. The winner must have at least k wins, and the minimal n for that is F_k. We want the maximum k such that F_k <= n.\n\n        The above while loop counts the number of Fibonacci numbers (in our sequence) that are <= n, and then subtracts 1 to get the index.\n\n        However, the Fibonacci sequence we are generating",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament follows a knockout format, meaning each player is eliminated once they lose a game. The key constraint is that any two players can only compete if their previous game counts differ by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of wins (games) the winner can achieve under these conditions.\n\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves recognizing a pattern related to the Fibonacci sequence. The minimal number of players required for a winner to have `k` wins follows a Fibonacci-like sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. Specifically, the minimal number of players for `k` wins is given by:\n   - F(0) = 1\n   - F(1) = 2\n   - F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2) for k ≥ 2\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm generates terms of this sequence until the term exceeds the given number of players `n`. The largest term less than or equal to `n` corresponds to the maximum number of wins the winner can have. This approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging the exponential growth of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large `n` (up to 10^18).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(log n) time because the Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially. Each iteration roughly doubles the number of players considered, leading to approximately 100 iterations for the upper constraint (n ≤ 10^18), which is computationally feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a, b = 1, 2\n    count = 0\n    while a <= n:\n        count += 1\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    print(count - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the input value `n`, which represents the number of players in the tournament.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: Variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 1 and 2, representing the first two terms of the modified Fibonacci sequence. The variable `count` keeps track of the number of terms generated that are less than or equal to `n`.\n3. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues generating subsequent Fibonacci terms (each term being the sum of the previous two terms) until the current term (`a`) exceeds `n`. For each valid term, `count` is incremented.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is derived by subtracting 1 from `count`, as the last valid term corresponds to the maximum number of wins the winner can achieve. This adjustment accounts for the initial counting of the first term (F(0)).\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to determine the solution with minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
