Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer from -x to x (excluding 0? Actually including 0? But note: the problem says \"each card\" doesn't exceed x in absolute value, so from -x to x inclusive.\n\n However, note: the problem says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use any integer in that range arbitrarily many times.\n\n We are to find the minimum number of additional cards such that the sum of all the numbers (found plus additional) is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let S = sum of the found cards.\n\n Then we need to form a set of additional cards (each between -x and x) such that their total sum is -S, and we want the minimum number of cards.\n\n Note: We are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. So the available numbers are symmetric.\n\n Observation:\n We are to cover the deficit (or surplus) of -S using the fewest cards. Each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or at least -x (if negative). The best way to minimize the number of cards is to use as large a magnitude as possible.\n\n However, note that the deficit might be positive or negative. Let deficit = -S.\n\n Since we can choose positive or negative, we can think of the deficit as an integer that we need to achieve.\n\n How to cover the deficit D (which is an integer) with the fewest cards?\n\n Each card can add at most |x| in absolute value. But note: we can also use both positive and negative.\n\n Actually, we are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. So the maximum absolute value we can get per card is x.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of cards must be at least ceil(|D| / x). However, wait: but we are allowed to use negative and positive. However, note that the deficit D might be negative, but we can use negative cards to reduce the total sum.\n\n Actually, let's reframe: we need the total sum of additional cards to be D (where D = -S). We can break D into a sum of k integers, each between -x and x.\n\n The maximum absolute value we can cover with k cards is k*x (if we take all same sign). However, we are not limited to one sign.\n\n But note: we can use any combination. The problem reduces to: what is the minimum k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak, each in [-x, x] such that a1+a2+...+ak = D?\n\n Conditions for k:\n\n 1. The sum D must be between -k*x and k*x (inclusive). This is necessary.\n\n 2. Moreover, we can adjust the sum by changing the signs. However, note that if D is within [-k*x, k*x], can we always form D?\n\n Actually, we can use the following: since we can choose any integers in [-x, x], we can use the idea of the coin problem but with arbitrary denominations? But note: we have every integer from -x to x. \n\n However, note that we don't require consecutive numbers, but we have every integer in that range. This is very flexible.\n\n In fact, the set of numbers we can form with k cards is every integer between -k*x and k*x? Not exactly: for example, with k=1, we can form every integer from -x to x. With k=2, we can form every integer from -2*x to 2*x? Actually, no: for example, if x=2, then with two cards we can form 4 (2+2) and -4, but also 3 (2+1), 2 (2+0), etc. Actually, we can form every integer between -2*x and 2*x because we have consecutive integers? \n\n But note: we have every integer from -x to x. Then with two cards, the minimum sum is -2*x and maximum 2*x, and we can form every integer in between? \n\n Actually, yes. Because we can use two consecutive numbers. For example, to get a sum s (between -2*x and 2*x), we can choose two numbers a and b such that a+b=s. Since the set of numbers is contiguous from -x to x, then for any s, we can set a = min(x, max(-x, s)) and then set b = s - a, and check if b is in [-x, x]. But wait, we can do better: the set of sums of two integers from [-x, x] is contiguous from -2*x to 2*x.\n\n Similarly, with k cards, we can form every integer between -k*x and k*x.\n\n Therefore, the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards equals zero. The additional cards can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Total Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards. Let this sum be `S`.\n2. **Determine the Deficit**: The deficit is the negative of this sum, i.e., `-S`. This is the total sum needed from the additional cards to balance the entire set to zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Deficit**: If the deficit is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: For a non-zero deficit, the minimum number of cards required is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the deficit divided by `x`. This is because each card can contribute at most `x` towards reducing the deficit (or adding up to `x` if the deficit is negative). However, if the deficit is not a multiple of `x`, an additional card is needed to cover the remaining difference.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    arr = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(arr)\n    deficit = -total_sum\n    \n    if deficit == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    abs_deficit = abs(deficit)\n    k = abs_deficit // x\n    remainder = abs_deficit % x\n    \n    if remainder > 0:\n        k += 1\n        \n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of any card), followed by `n` integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Total Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine the deficit needed to balance the sum to zero.\n3. **Deficit Check**: If the deficit is zero, the answer is zero since no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: The minimum number of cards required is calculated by dividing the absolute value of the deficit by `x` and taking the ceiling of the result. If there's a remainder after division, an extra card is needed to cover the remaining difference.\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the minimum number of additional cards required.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions and calculates the solution with optimal performance, handling all edge cases where the deficit might be zero or require an additional card due to a remainder.",
