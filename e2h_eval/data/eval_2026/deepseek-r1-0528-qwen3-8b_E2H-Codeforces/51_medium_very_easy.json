Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile) with the combined frequency of the first two.\n 3. If the two frequencies match exactly (same letters and same counts), then output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that the pile should be exactly the letters from the two names (without extra or missing).\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines, strip the newlines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines to form a string that represents all the letters needed.\n - Count the frequency of each letter in the concatenated string and in the third string.\n - Compare the two frequency counts.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   We combine: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   Then we count the letters in \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" and compare with the count in \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n But note: the example input has a trailing newline? We use strip to remove any extraneous whitespace or newline.\n\n However, note: the input may have newline characters. We can use .strip() to remove them.\n\n Alternatively, we can just use .replace('\\n', '') or simply split by newline and take the first two and the third.\n\n Since the input has three lines, we can do:\n\n   guest = input().strip()\n   host = input().strip()\n   pile = input().strip()\n\n Then, we can create a string `needed` = guest + host.\n\n Then, we can use collections.Counter for both `needed` and `pile`.\n\n But note: the problem states that the length of each line does not exceed 100, so even if we do a Counter, it's efficient.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   guest = input().strip()\n   host = input().strip()\n   pile = input().strip()\n\n   needed_counter = Counter(guest + host)\n   pile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\n   if needed_counter == pile_counter:\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n   guest = \"SANTACLAUS\", host = \"DEDMOROZ\", pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   needed_counter: \n        S:3, A:2, N:1, T:2, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n   pile_counter: \n        S:3, A:2, N:1, T:2, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1 -> matches.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: \n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Needed: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n        P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:1, J:1, U:2, K:2\n\n   Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n        J:1, O:2, U:2, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:1, E:1, K:2 -> wait, but note: \n        In the needed we have L:1, but in the pile we have L:2. So they don't match.\n\n   Actually, the example says: \"In the second sample letter 'P' is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter 'L'.\"\n\n   Let me check the example input as given in the problem:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', \n         'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', \n         'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   Wait, actually the example input is provided as a list of three strings? But the problem says:\n\n        Input file consists of three lines.\n\n   And the example output is ['YES', 'NO', 'NO'].\n\n   So the second sample input is:\n\n        Line1: 'PAPAINOEL'\n        Line2: 'JOULUPUKKI'\n        Line3: 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'\n\n   Now, let's break down the second sample:\n\n        Guest: \"PAPAINOEL\" -> letters: P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1\n        Host: \"JOULUPUKKI\" -> J:1, O:1, U:2, L:1, P:1, U: already counted, K:2, I:1\n        Combined: P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:2, K:2\n\n   But wait, the host has one P and the guest has two P's, so total P is 3.\n\n   Now, the pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Let's count: \n          J:1, O:2, U:2, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:1, E:1, K:2\n\n        So we are missing one P (we need 3, but got 2) and we have an extra L (we need 2, but got 3? Actually, in the combined we need 2 L's because:\n            Guest: \"PAPAINOEL\" -> has one L.\n            Host: \"JOULUPUKKI\" -> has one L.\n\n        So total L is 2. But the pile has 2 L's? Let me recount the pile: \n            \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\": \n                J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I\n\n        Actually, the pile string is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\", which has two L's? Let me write it out:\n\n        J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I -> that's three L's.\n\n        So the pile has 3 L's, but we only need 2. So the pile has an extra L and is missing a P.\n\n   Therefore, the Counter method will show that the counts are different.\n\n   Similarly, the third example:\n\n        Input: \n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        We combine: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        Then the pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        We'll see if the counts match.\n\n   Let's do the counts:\n\n        Needed: \n            BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\n            B:3, A:4, O:1, N:1, T:2, E:1, F:1, H:1, R:2, C:1, S:1, I:1, M:1, ... \n\n        Pile: \n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n            B:3, A:4, ... but wait, let me count:\n\n            Actually, the needed string: \n                BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS -> \n                    B:3, A:4, O:1, N:1, T:2, E:1, F:1, H:1, R:2, C:1, S:1, I:1, M:1, ... \n\n            Pile: \n                BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n                Let's break it down: \n                    BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n                Counting B: \n                    First two: 'B','A','B' -> then later: 'B','O','N','A','T','A','L','L','E','F','A','T','H','E','R' -> \n                    How many B's? \n                        In \"BAB\": 2, then later in \"BONATALL\": one more -> 3.\n\n                But wait, the example says: there's an extra letter 'L'. \n\n                In the needed, how many L's?\n                    BABBONATALE: no L\n                    FATHERCHRISTMAS: no L\n                    So total L: 0? \n\n                But wait, the example input for the third sample is:\n\n                    BABBONATALE\n                    FATHERCHRISTMAS\n                    BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n                The combined string is \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n                Let's check the letters in \"BABBONATALE\": no L.\n                \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\": no L.\n\n                Then why does the pile have two L's? \n\n                Actually, the example output is \"NO\", and the note says: \"there's an extra letter 'L'\".\n\n                So the pile has two L's that are not needed. \n\n                Therefore, the Counter for the pile will have an extra L, so the counts won't match.\n\n   So the code using Counter should work.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the pile might have extra letters. We must ensure that the pile has exactly the same multiset of letters as the concatenation of the first two.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   But note: the example inputs are given as a list of three strings, but our program reads three lines.\n\n   We assume the input is from stdin.\n\n   Code:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   def main():\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if len(data) < 3:\n            # According to the problem, there are three lines, but just in case.\n            # But the problem states three lines, so we can assume three.\n            guest = data[0].strip()\n            host = data[1].strip()\n            pile = data[2].strip()\n        else:\n            # This is redundant because the problem says three lines, but if we want to be safe.\n            guest = data[0].strip()\n            host = data[1].strip()\n            pile = data[2].strip()\n\n        # Alternatively, we can read line by line without reading all at once.\n        # But using readlines() is safe.\n\n        # Since the problem says each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters, we can proceed.\n\n        s1 = guest + host\n        c1 = Counter(s1)\n        c2 = Counter(pile)\n\n        if c1 == c2:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input file consists of three lines. We can also use:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n   But using input() might be slow if there are many lines, but here only three.\n\n   Let's use:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n   This is simpler.\n\n   But note: the input might not have newlines? The problem says each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters.\n\n   Using input() will read one line at a time.\n\n   Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n   Example 1: \n        Input: \n            SANTACLAUS\n            DEDMOROZ\n            SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n        Output: YES\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n            PAPAINOEL\n            JOULUPUKKI\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   Example 3:\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        Output: NO\n\n   We'll run the code with these examples.\n\n   However, note: the example input is given as a list of three strings, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n   We must be cautious: the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', \n         'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', \n         'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   But wait, each string in the list above is actually one string that has embedded newlines? Actually, the first string is the entire first line including the newline? Or the list contains the three lines separately?\n\n   Actually, the example input format is three lines. So the example input is:\n\n        Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n        Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n        Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   But the example input representation is shown with quotes and having '\\n'? That's just a representation.\n\n   Our code reads three lines. So we are good.\n\n   However, note: if the input is given via a file, then the newlines are present. But using .strip() removes the newline.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid using .strip() if we are sure that the last character is a newline, but the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters.\n\n   But if we use .strip(), we remove any trailing whitespace (including newline). \n\n   But the problem says the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters, so there shouldn't be any spaces. \n\n   We can also not use .strip() and just use the lines as read, because the newline character is included in the read line? \n\n   Actually, when we use input(), it reads a line and by default strips the trailing newline. But if we use sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), then we get the lines without the newline.\n\n   Since the problem says the lines are not empty, we can use either.\n\n   Let's stick to:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n   But note: if the input is provided without newlines (like from a file that doesn't end with a newline) then splitlines() would still work, but input() also works.\n\n   However, the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\", meaning each line is on its own.\n\n   We'll use the input() method.\n\n   One more edge case: what if the combined string and the pile have the same letters but different order? Then the Counter will say they are equal.\n\n   We are counting the frequency, so order doesn't matter.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   guest = input().strip()\n   host = input().strip()\n   pile = input().strip()\n\n   if Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, the problem says the pile may have extra letters. This comparison will fail if the pile has extra letters or missing letters.\n\n   This is exactly what we want.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters\". \n\n   This means the pile must have exactly the letters from the two names. So the above condition is correct.\n\n   Let me run the sample tests.\n\n   Example 1: \n        guest = \"SANTACLAUS\", host = \"DEDMOROZ\", pile = \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n        Counter(\"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\") -> \n            S:3, A:2, N:2, T:2, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1\n\n        Counter(\"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\") -> \n            S:3, A:2, N:2, T:2, C:1, L:1, U:1, D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1 -> matches.\n\n   Example 2: \n        guest = \"PAPAINOEL\", host = \"JOULUPUKKI\", pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n        Counter(\"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\") -> \n            P:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:1, J:1, U:2, K:2\n\n        Counter(\"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\") -> \n            J:1, O:2, U:2, L:3, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:2, E:1, K:2\n\n        They are not equal because P:3 vs P:2 and L:1 vs L:3.\n\n   Example 3: \n        guest = \"BABBONATALE\", host = \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\", pile = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Counter(\"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\") -> \n            B:3, A:4, O:1, N:2, T:2, E:2, F:1, H:1, R:2, C:1, S:1, I:1, M:1\n\n        Counter(\"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\") -> \n            B:3, A:4, O:1, N:2, T:2, E:2, F:1, H:1, R:2, C:1, S:1, I:1, M:1, L:2\n\n        Wait, the pile has an extra L (count=2) and the needed has no L (count=0). \n\n        But wait, in the guest \"BABBONATALE\": no L, host \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\": no L. So indeed needed has 0 L.\n\n        However, the pile has two L's. So the Counter for the needed will have 0 for L, but the pile has 2 for L.\n\n        Therefore, the condition fails.\n\n   But wait, the example input for the third sample is:\n\n        BABBONATALE\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS\n        BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n   The pile string is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\", which indeed has two L's.\n\n   However, the example output is \"NO\", so our code outputs \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n   But wait, let me recount the needed string:\n\n        BABBONATALE: \n            B:3, A:2, O:1, N:1, T:1, E:1, L:0\n\n        FATHERCHRISTMAS:\n            F:1, A:1, T:1, H:1, E:1, R:1, C:1, H:1, R:1, I:1, S:1, T:1, M:1, A:1, S:1\n\n        Actually, wait, let me break down the host: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n\n        F:1, A:1, T:1, H:2, E:1, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1\n\n        Now, combining guest and host:\n\n            B:3, A:3, O:1, N:1, T:2, E:2, F:1, H:2, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1\n\n        Now, the pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        Let me break down the pile:\n\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n            B:3, A:3, C:1, H:2, R:2, I:1, S:2, T:3, M:1, O:1, N:1, E:3, F:1, ... and then two L's.\n\n            Actually, let's count again:\n\n            B:3 (from \"BAB\")\n            A:3 (from \"BAB\" has 2, then \"CHRISTMAS\" has 1, then \"BONATALLE\" has 1 -> total 4? Wait, let me do it properly.\n\n        We should use a Counter for the pile:\n\n            pile_string = \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            B: count of 'B': 3 (positions: 0,1, then later: after 'MAS' and then in 'FATHER'? Actually, the string is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n            Let me write it out:\n\n            B, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E, F, A, T, H, E, R\n\n            Actually, I think the example input was meant to be without the extra L's. But the problem says the third sample output is \"NO\", so we trust the problem.\n\n        We are confident that the Counter method is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the final code is:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   guest = input().strip()\n   host = input().strip()\n   pile = input().strip()\n\n   if Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, there is an alternative: sometimes the problem may have the same letters but the pile string is longer or shorter. The Counter will naturally handle that because if the pile is longer, then some letter will have a higher count, and if shorter, then some letter will have a lower count.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say the length of each line does not exceed 100. So the combined string is at most 200, and the pile is at most 100? Actually, the problem says the third line (the pile) has length not exceeding 100? \n\n   Wait, the problem says: \"The length of each line does not exceed 100.\" So the pile is at most 100. But the combined guest and host is at most 200. \n\n   However, if the pile has length 100 and the combined is 200, then they cannot be equal. But the problem says \"There are no extra letters\", meaning the pile must have exactly the same letters as the two names. \n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.\"\n\n   So if the pile is shorter than the combined, then we don't have enough letters. If longer, then we have extra.\n\n   Our Counter comparison will fail in both cases.\n\n   But note: the problem says the pile is the letters found at the door. The two names together are the expected letters.\n\n   We are comparing the two multisets. The Counter will automatically account for the counts.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   Let me test with a small example that fails due to length mismatch.\n\n   Example: \n        guest = \"A\"\n        host = \"B\"\n        pile = \"C\"\n\n        Then the combined string is \"AB\", which has two letters. The pile has one letter. The Counter for \"AB\" is {'A':1, 'B':1} and for \"C\" is {'C':1}. They are not equal -> prints \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n   Another example:\n\n        guest = \"A\"\n        host = \"A\"\n        pile = \"AA\"\n\n        Then combined is \"AA\", Counter is {'A':2}; pile Counter is {'A':2} -> \"YES\".\n\n   So it's correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not specify that the pile must have the same length as the two names combined. But logically, if the pile is shorter, then we are missing letters; if longer, then we have extra.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   But note: the problem says the third line is the pile. The pile must be exactly the two names (so same multiset). \n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the input is from stdin. We are reading from stdin.\n\n   One more thing: if the input is large, but the problem says at most 100 per line, so maximum 200 for the combined, and 100 for the pile. So the Counter is very efficient.\n\n   We are good.\n\n   Let me write the code without any extra libraries? We are using collections.Counter. \n\n   But the problem does not require any specific module, but it is standard.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do without Counter by using a dictionary or even by counting manually. But Counter is clear.\n\n   However, if we want to avoid importing, we can do:\n\n        from collections import Counter   # standard library, so it's acceptable.\n\n   But if we are in an environment without Counter, we can do:\n\n        guest = input().strip()\n        host = input().strip()\n        pile = input().strip()\n\n        s1 = guest + host\n        s2 = pile\n\n        # Create two dictionaries for counts\n        dict1 = {}\n        dict2 = {}\n\n        for char in s1:\n            dict1[char] = dict1.get(char, 0) + 1\n\n        for char in s2:\n            dict2[char] = dict2.get(char, 0) + 1\n\n        if dict1 == dict2:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   But the problem is easy and the strings are short, so either way is acceptable.\n\n   However, the problem says the length of each line does not exceed 100, so we are safe.\n\n   We'll choose the Counter version for clarity.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.\"\n\n   We are including the necessary import.\n\n   Final code:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   guest = input().strip()\n   host = input().strip()\n   pile = input().strip()\n\n   if Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, wait: the example input in the problem statement is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   But this is just the example representation. The actual input will be three lines.\n\n   We assume the input is coming from standard input.\n\n   We'll run the code and hope for the best.\n\n   But note: the example output is ['YES', 'NO', 'NO'].\n\n   However, our code is designed for three separate lines.\n\n   The example input representation has the three samples, but we are reading one sample at a time.\n\n   We are writing a program that reads three lines from stdin and outputs one line (either \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\n   So if we are given one of the three samples, we output the corresponding answer.\n\n   But the problem says: the input file consists of three lines.\n\n   So the entire input is three lines. The sample input is provided as three lines.\n\n   Therefore, we are set.\n\n   We submit the code.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. This means the pile must contain exactly the same multiset of letters as the concatenation of the two names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: Read three lines from the standard input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string representing all required letters.\n3. **Count Letters**: Use a frequency counter (like Python's `collections.Counter`) to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Compare Counts**: If the frequency counts of the combined names and the pile match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of letter counts between the combined names and the pile, ensuring no extra or missing letters are present.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The code reads three lines from standard input, stripping any trailing whitespace or newline characters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string called `combined`.\n3. **Frequency Counting**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each character in both the `combined` string and the pile string.\n4. **Comparison**: The code checks if the frequency counts of the `combined` string and the pile string are identical. If they are, it prints \"YES\", indicating the pile can form the names exactly; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis solution efficiently verifies the required conditions using a straightforward and clear method, leveraging Python's built-in tools for simplicity and readability.",
