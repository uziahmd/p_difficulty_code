Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers R and B (number of rebels and bases) and then 2R+B points (R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases). We need to check if there exists a perfect matching (one-to-one assignment) between the R rebels and the B bases such that the straight line segments (from each base to its assigned spaceship) do not intersect.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" from a base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. But note that the matching is one-to-one, so we have exactly R bases? Actually, wait: the input has R rebels and B bases, but the condition is that every base must have exactly one guardian and each spaceship exactly one base. Therefore, we require R = B. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\n But the input says: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\", meaning we are assigning all R spaceships to B bases. However, the condition requires that every base has exactly one guardian. So if R != B, then we cannot have a perfect matching (each base one and each spaceship one). \n\n However, note the example input: \n   Input: '3 3 ...' -> Yes\n   Input: '2 1 ...' -> No\n\n In the second example, we have 2 rebels and 1 base, so clearly we cannot assign two rebels to one base (since each base must have exactly one) and also each rebel must be assigned one base. So the matching is not perfect because the number of bases (1) is less than the number of rebels (2). Similarly, if R != B, we output 'No'.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". This implies that we must use all spaceships and all bases. Therefore, we require R == B.\n\n However, the example input format: \n   First line: R, B (which might not be equal). Then R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n So first, we should check if R == B. If not, output 'No'.\n\n Now, assuming R == B, we have 2*R points (but actually R + B = 2*R when R=B). \n\n The constraint: the straight line segments (from base to its assigned spaceship) must not intersect.\n\n How to solve?\n Since R and B are at most 10, we can try to use backtracking (permutation) but 10! is about 3.6 million which is acceptable in worst-case in Python if optimized. However, we have to check non-intersection for the entire set of edges (each matching produces R edges, and they must not intersect). But note: the condition is that any two paths (edges) do not intersect. \n\n However, note: the edges are between bases and rebels. But the bases and rebels are distinct sets of points. The problem does not specify which point is which, but we know the first R points are rebels and the next B are bases.\n\n But wait: the input order: \n   First line: R, B\n   Then R lines: rebels\n   Then B lines: bases.\n\n So we have two sets: \n   Rebels: list of R points\n   Bases: list of B points\n\n And we want a bijection f: {Rebel i} -> {Base j} such that the set of segments { (Rebel_i, Base_j) } for all i (with j = f(i)) do not cross.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning any two edges (from base to its assigned spaceship) must not intersect. \n\n Important: The edges are drawn from the base to the rebel (or vice versa). We are to avoid intersections.\n\n But note: the edges are drawn in the plane. Two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) (where p1, p2 are bases and q1, q2 are rebels) do not intersect if they don't share an endpoint and if they don't cross.\n\n However, note that the endpoints are distinct and no three points are colinear.\n\n Approach:\n\n 1. Check if R == B. If not, output 'No'.\n 2. If R == B, then we have to consider all permutations (matchings) of bases to rebels. There are R! possibilities.\n\n But wait: we have two sets: rebels and bases. We can consider a matching from rebels to bases (or bases to rebels). Let's define:\n   rebels = [r0, r1, ..., r_{R-1}]\n   bases = [b0, b1, ..., b_{B-1}] (and since R=B, bases has R elements)\n\n Then a matching is a permutation p of [0, R-1] such that we connect rebel i to base p(i).\n\n Then we have to check for the entire set of edges (each edge being (rebel_i, base_p[i])) whether any two edges (i, j) and (k, l) (with i != k, and j != l) intersect.\n\n However, note: the edges are between two distinct sets. The endpoints are distinct. We have to check for non-intersection of two edges (a, b) and (c, d) (where a and c are rebels, and b and d are bases) and the four points are distinct.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the edges do not touch (they can meet at endpoints? but the problem says \"paths\" from base to its assigned spaceship. The endpoints are distinct so two edges only meet if they share an endpoint, but in our matching each base and each rebel is used exactly once, so two edges will never share an endpoint. Therefore, we only need to check if two edges cross (i.e., their interiors intersect).\n\n How to check if two segments (a,b) and (c,d) intersect?\n\n We can use the standard method: check the orientation (cross product) of the four points.\n\n For four distinct points A, B, C, D, the segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n   (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) have different orientations (one clockwise and one counterclockwise) AND\n   (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) have different orientations.\n\n However, note: the segments are directed arbitrarily. Also, we have to be cautious with collinearity, but the problem states no three points are colinear. So we don't have to worry about collinear cases.\n\n But wait: the four points might be arranged so that the two segments do not intersect even if the above conditions hold? Actually, the standard condition for two segments to intersect (without sharing endpoints) is:\n\n   def ccw(A, B, C):\n        return (C[0]-A[0])*(B[1]-A[1]) > (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1])\n\n   Then, segments (A,B) and (C,D) intersect if:\n        ccw(A, B, C) != ccw(A, B, D) and ccw(C, D, A) != ccw(C, D, B)\n\n However, note: the above condition is standard for checking if two segments (AB and CD) intersect in the plane (when no three are collinear).\n\n But note: the edges are from a base to a rebel. The two sets are distinct, but the points are arbitrary.\n\n However, we must check for every pair of edges (i, j) and (k, l) (i != k, j != l) in the matching that they do not intersect.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read R, B and the points.\n\n   Step 2: If R != B: print 'No'\n\n   Step 3: If R == B, then generate all permutations of range(R) (which represents the matching: the i-th rebel is matched to the i-th base in the permutation? Actually, let the bases be in a fixed list. We can consider the matching as a permutation of the bases: we assign base index p(i) to rebel i.\n\n   Alternatively, we can also consider a permutation of the rebels (if we fix the bases as the first set). But note: the rebels are given first and bases next. \n\n   We have two lists:\n        rebels = [ (x0,y0), (x1,y1), ... , (x_{R-1}, y_{R-1}) ]\n        bases = [ (x_R, y_R), ... ]\n\n   Then a matching is a bijection f: {0,1,...,R-1} -> {0,1,...,R-1} (since R=B). We can represent the matching by an array `perm` of length R, where `perm[i]` is the index of the base assigned to rebel i.\n\n   Then the edges are: \n        edge0: (rebels[0], bases[perm[0]])\n        edge1: (rebels[1], bases[perm[1]])\n        ...\n\n   Then we have to check that for every pair (i, j) (i < j) of rebels, the two edges (i, j) and (k, l) (actually, we need to check every pair of edges) do not intersect.\n\n   Actually, we need to check that for any two edges (i, perm[i]) and (j, perm[j]) (with i < j), the two segments do not intersect.\n\n   Step 4: For a given permutation, check for every pair (i, j) (i < j) that the two segments (rebels[i], bases[perm[i]]) and (rebels[j], bases[perm[j]]) do not intersect.\n\n   Step 5: If we find one permutation that satisfies the condition, output 'Yes'. If none does, output 'No'.\n\n However, worst-case R=10, then 10! is 3628800. For each permutation, we check C(10,2)=45 pairs, and for each pair we do a constant-time check (using the ccw function). So total operations: 3628800 * 45 which is about 163 million checks, each check being a few arithmetic operations. This is acceptable in Python? Maybe, but we should try to optimize or use a smarter method.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a graph approach: build a graph where an edge exists between a rebel i and a base j if the segment (rebel_i, base_j) does not intersect with any other segment that would be drawn from the same set of rebels and bases in the matching? But note: the matching condition is global. \n\n However, note: the condition that the entire set of edges do not intersect is global. But observe: if we fix the matching, then the condition is that no two edges cross. \n\n Another idea: we can use the fact that the entire set of edges must form a planar embedding. But the problem is small.\n\n But wait: we must check for every pair of edges, so the condition is independent of the order. However, note that the edges are drawn from two distinct sets (bases and rebels) and the matching is a bipartite matching.\n\n There is a known fact: In a complete bipartite graph K_{n,n} with two sets (say A and B) embedded in the plane (with no three points collinear), we can test if there exists a planar embedding (without crossing edges) by checking if the graph is outerplanar? Not exactly, but note: we are allowed to use straight-line segments.\n\n However, we can also think: if we fix the positions of the rebels and bases, then the condition for a matching to avoid crossings is equivalent to the following: \n\n   The matching must be a non-crossing bipartite matching.\n\n There is a known algorithm for non-crossing bipartite matching? But note, the problem does not require the matching to be non-crossing for arbitrary embeddings, but for the given embedding.\n\n One more idea: sort the rebels and bases by x-coordinate (or by some other order) and then use a greedy matching? But note: the condition is that the entire set of edges must not cross. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   Sort the rebels and bases by x-coordinate (or by y-coordinate). Then, if we draw the edges without crossing, the matching must be such that the order of the bases (by x) is the same as the order of the rebels (by x) (or reverse, depending on the direction). But wait, that is the condition for a non-crossing bipartite matching when the two sets are interleaved arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the matching to be non-crossing in the sense of having the same order, but the edges must not cross.\n\n Actually, in computational geometry, for two sets of points in the plane (no three collinear) and a bipartite matching, the condition for non-crossing edges is that the matching is a non-crossing bipartite matching. There is a theorem: given two sets of points in convex position, we can compute a non-crossing matching. But our points are not necessarily in convex position.\n\n However, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Sort the rebels by x-coordinate, and the bases by x-coordinate (or by y-coordinate) and then check if the matching preserves the order (i.e., if we draw the edges without crossing, then the relative order of the bases and rebels along the x-axis must be preserved). But wait, this is similar to the standard non-crossing matching in two rows.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the positions, so we have to check all matchings.\n\n However, we can use the following observation: if we draw the edges without crossing, then the matching must be such that the edges are drawn from left to right (or right to left) without crossing. \n\n Another known fact: the set of non-crossing bipartite matchings between two sets of points (in general position) can be found by sorting one set and then matching in increasing order (or decreasing). But that is only one possibility.\n\n Actually, the problem is small (R,B<=10) so we can use brute-force over permutations.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read R, B.\n   If R != B: print 'No'\n   Else:\n        rebels = []\n        bases = []\n        Read next R lines for rebels.\n        Read next B lines for bases.\n\n        Then, generate all permutations of [0,1,...,B-1] (which is the same as [0,1,...,R-1] since R=B).\n\n        For each permutation p (which is a list of length R, where p[i] is the base index for rebel i):\n\n            Let edges = [ (rebels[i], bases[p[i]]) for i in range(R) ]\n\n            Then, for each pair (i, j) with i < j:\n                Check if the two edges (rebels[i], bases[p[i]]) and (rebels[j], bases[p[j]]) intersect.\n\n            If no intersection is found, then output 'Yes' and break.\n\n        If no permutation works, output 'No'\n\n   We need a helper function to check if two segments (A,B) and (C,D) intersect (without sharing endpoints, and no three points collinear).\n\n   Note: We assume all points are distinct and no three are collinear.\n\n   The function:\n\n        def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n            # Check if segments AB and CD intersect.\n            def cross(o, a, b):\n                return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (b[0]-o[0])*(a[1]-o[1])\n\n            # Check orientation of the four points\n            o1 = cross(a, b, c)\n            o2 = cross(a, b, d)\n            o3 = cross(c, d, a)\n            o4 = cross(c, d, b)\n\n            # General case: the two segments intersect if the orientations are different for both orders.\n            if ((o1 < 0 and o2 > 0) or (o1 > 0 and o2 < 0)) and ((o3 < 0 and o4 > 0) or (o3 > 0 and o4 < 0)):\n                return True\n\n            # But wait: the above condition is for proper crossing. However, note that if one of the orientations is zero, then the points are collinear. But the problem states no three points are collinear, so we don't have zeros.\n\n            # However, the above condition is sufficient. But note: the condition is for the two segments to have endpoints on opposite sides of the other segment.\n\n            # But there is another possibility: the segments could be collinear? The problem says no three points are collinear, so no.\n\n            # Actually, the standard condition is:\n\n            #   They intersect if and only if \n            #      (o1 and o2 have opposite signs) and (o3 and o4 have opposite signs)\n\n            # But note: what if one of the points is on the other segment? However, the problem states that the endpoints are distinct and no three points are collinear, so the endpoints won't lie on the other segment.\n\n            return False\n\n        However, wait: the above condition returns True only if they cross. But we want to check for non-intersection. So we want to return True if they do NOT intersect? Actually, no: we want to check for intersection, and then if we find an intersection, the matching is invalid.\n\n        Actually, in the above function, we return True if the segments intersect. But note: the condition I wrote above returns True when they intersect. However, let me write the condition correctly:\n\n        The standard condition is:\n\n            def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                def ccw(A, B, C):\n                    return (C[0]-A[0])*(B[1]-A[1]) != (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1])\n\n                # Actually, wait: the cross product method for checking non-collinear and the orientation is more common as:\n\n                # We can use the following: two segments AB and CD intersect if and only if\n                #   (A and B are on opposite sides of CD) and (C and D are on opposite sides of AB)\n\n                # But the above condition using cross products (the sign changes) is:\n\n                #   o1 = cross(c, d, a)   -> orientation of (c,d,a)\n                #   o2 = cross(c, d, b)\n                #   o3 = cross(a, b, c)\n                #   o4 = cross(a, b, d)\n\n                # Actually, the standard way is to check:\n\n                #   if ccw(A, B, C) != ccw(A, B, D) and ccw(A, C, B) != ccw(C, D, A): then they intersect.\n\n                # But wait, there is a better way: \n\n                #   Let's define a function for orientation (return value: positive, negative, or zero). Then:\n\n                def orient(A, B, C):\n                    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\n                o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n                o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n                o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n                o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n\n                # Then, if o1 and o2 have opposite signs and o3 and o4 have opposite signs, then they intersect.\n\n                if (o1*o2 < 0) and (o3*o4 < 0):\n                    return True\n                return False\n\n        However, note: the above condition does not cover the case when the two segments are collinear, but the problem says no three points are collinear so we don't have to worry.\n\n        But wait, what if the two segments are adjacent and one endpoint is on the other segment? Actually, the condition above is for proper crossing. However, note: the problem states that the endpoints are distinct and no three points are collinear, so the endpoints won't lie on the other segment. \n\n        However, the condition above (o1*o2 < 0) means that c and d are on opposite sides of the line AB. Similarly for o3*o4 < 0. \n\n        But there is a catch: the condition is necessary and sufficient for proper crossing (when the segments are not collinear and the endpoints are not lying on the other segment). \n\n        However, there is an alternative: use the bounding box method? But the above is standard.\n\n        But wait: the standard condition for two segments (A,B) and (C,D) to intersect (given no three points collinear) is:\n\n            (orient(A, B, C) * orient(A, B, D) < 0) and (orient(C, D, A) * orient(C, D, B) < 0)\n\n        So we'll use:\n\n            def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                def orient(a, b, c):\n                    return (b[0]-a[0])*(c[1]-a[1]) - (b[1]-a[1])*(c[0]-a[0])\n\n                o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n                o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n                o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n                o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n\n                if (o1*o2 < 0) and (o3*o4 < 0):\n                    return True\n                else:\n                    return False\n\n        However, note: the function `orient` returns a positive, negative, or zero. But we are guaranteed no three points collinear, so the product being negative (meaning opposite signs) is the condition.\n\n        But wait: the above function might return true for degenerate cases? We don't have degenerate cases.\n\n        However, we must note: the four points must be distinct, which they are.\n\n        Let me test with a known crossing: \n            A=(0,0), B=(2,2), C=(0,2), D=(2,0)\n            Segment AB is the diagonal from (0,0) to (2,2); segment CD is the diagonal from (0,2) to (2,0). They cross.\n\n            For orient(A, B, C): \n                A=(0,0), B=(2,2), C=(0,2)\n                = (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) = 2*2 - 2*0 = 4\n            orient(A, B, D): \n                A=(0,0), B=(2,2), D=(2,0)\n                = (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) = 0 - 4 = -4\n            So o1*o2 = 4*(-4) = -16 < 0.\n\n            Now, orient(C, D, A):\n                C=(0,2), D=(2,0), A=(0,0)\n                = (2-0)*(0-2) - (0-2)*(0-0) = (2)*(-2) - (-2)*0 = -4\n            orient(C, D, B):\n                C=(0,2), D=(2,0), B=(2,2)\n                = (2-0)*(2-2) - (0-2)*(2-0) = 0 - (-2)*2 = 4\n            So o3*o4 = (-4)*4 = -16 < 0.\n\n            So returns True.\n\n        Another test: non-crossing\n            A=(0,0), B=(2,0), C=(1,1), D=(3,0)\n            Segment AB from (0,0) to (2,0); segment CD from (1,1) to (3,0). Do they cross?\n            They do not.\n\n            orient(A, B, C): (2,0) and (1,1): (2-0)*(1-0) - (0-0)*(1-0) = 2*1 - 0 = 2\n            orient(A, B, D): (2,0) and (3,0): (2-0)*(0-0) - (0-0)*(3-0) = 0 - 0 = 0 -> but wait, no three points are collinear, so we shouldn't have 0? \n\n        Wait, in our example, the points are: \n            A=(0,0), B=(2,0), D=(3,0) -> these three are collinear. But the problem says no three points are collinear. So we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, we can rely on the condition.\n\n        However, note: the bases and rebels are distinct and no three points are collinear. So we are safe.\n\n        But wait: what if the two segments share an endpoint? Then the matching is invalid because the endpoints are distinct (each base and rebel is used once) so two edges cannot share an endpoint. Therefore, the four points are distinct.\n\n        So the function is:\n\n            def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                def orient(a, b, c):\n                    return (b[0]-a[0])*(c[1]-a[1]) - (b[1]-a[1])*(c[0]-a[0])\n                o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n                o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n                o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n                o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n                return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n\n        However, note: the above condition is for two segments that do not share endpoints, and no three points collinear.\n\n        But wait: the above function uses the same `orient` function for all. \n\n        However, there is a caveat: the condition for two segments to intersect is sometimes stated as:\n\n            They intersect if and only if one point of the second segment lies on one side of the first and the other on the other side, and vice versa.\n\n        The above condition (using the product) is correct.\n\n        But note: the standard condition for two segments (AB and CD) to intersect is:\n\n            (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) have different orientations (one positive and one negative) AND (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) have different orientations.\n\n        And that is what we did.\n\n        However, the condition (o1 * o2 < 0) is equivalent to (o1 and o2 having opposite signs). Similarly for o3 and o4.\n\n        One more thing: the order of the points in the orient function matters. The function `orient(a, b, c)` returns a positive value if c is to the left of the directed line from a to b, negative if to the right, and zero if collinear.\n\n        So the condition is correct.\n\n        But note: the two segments are (a,b) and (c,d). The condition is symmetric.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the function `segments_intersect` is called with two edges: (a, b) and (c, d) and we are passing the four points as distinct.\n\n        Now, the main loop:\n\n            for perm in itertools.permutations(range(R)):\n                valid = True\n                # Build edges: for i in range(R): edge from rebels[i] to bases[perm[i]]\n                # Now, check every pair of edges: for i in range(R): for j in range(i+1, R): \n                for i in range(R):\n                    for j in range(i+1, R):\n                        # Get the two edges: \n                        edge1 = (rebels[i], bases[perm[i]])\n                        edge2 = (rebels[j], bases[perm[j]])\n                        if segments_intersect(edge1[0], edge1[1], edge2[0], edge2[1]):\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                    if not valid:\n                        break\n\n                if valid:\n                    print(\"Yes\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n            print(\"No\")\n\n        However, note: the edges are defined by two endpoints. We are passing four points to `segments_intersect`: the first two are the first segment, the next two are the second.\n\n        But wait: the function `segments_intersect` expects four points: a, b, c, d. It interprets them as segment (a,b) and (c,d). \n\n        We are calling it with: \n            segments_intersect(rebels[i].x, rebels[i].y, bases[perm[i]].x, bases[perm[i]].y, ...) \n        Actually, no: we are passing the tuple as (a, b, c, d) but in the function we unpacked the points. \n\n        But wait, in the call:\n\n            segments_intersect(edge1[0], edge1[1], edge2[0], edge2[1])\n\n        Here, edge1[0] is a point (tuple) and edge1[1] is a point (tuple). Similarly for edge2.\n\n        However, in the function definition, the parameters are four points (each point is (x,y)). Then inside the function, we define an inner function `orient(a, b, c)` that takes three points.\n\n        But wait, the call: \n            segments_intersect(a, b, c, d)\n        where a, b, c, d are the four points (each is a tuple of two numbers). Then inside the function, we use:\n\n            o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n            o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n\n        But the `orient` function expects three points (each two-dimensional). So this is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input: \n            Input: ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n        The first example: \n            R=3, B=3\n            Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n            Bases: [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\n        We must check if there is a permutation that avoids crossings.\n\n        One possible matching is the identity: \n            rebel0 (0,0) to base0 (-2,1)\n            rebel1 (2,0) to base1 (0,3)\n            rebel2 (3,1) to base2 (2,2)\n\n        Check edges:\n            Edge1: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n            Edge2: (2,0) to (0,3)\n            Edge3: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\n        Check Edge1 and Edge2: \n            (0,0), (-2,1) and (2,0), (0,3)\n            Let me plot: \n                Edge1: from (0,0) to (-2,1): goes left-up.\n                Edge2: from (2,0) to (0,3): goes left-up.\n\n            Do they cross? \n                We can compute the orientation:\n\n            For Edge1 and Edge2:\n\n                orient( (0,0), (-2,1), (2,0) ) = \n                    ( (-2-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) ) = (-2*0) - (1*2) = 0 - 2 = -2\n                orient( (0,0), (-2,1), (0,3) ) = \n                    ( (-2-0)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(0-0) ) = (-2*3) - (1*0) = -6\n\n                Both are negative, so condition (o1*o2 < 0) fails (both negative -> product positive). So they don't cross by this condition.\n\n            Now, the other condition: \n                orient( (2,0), (0,3), (0,0) ) = \n                    ( (0-2)*(0-0) - (3-0)*(0-2) ) = ( -2*0 ) - (3*(-2)) = 0 + 6 = 6\n                orient( (2,0), (0,3), (-2,1) ) = \n                    ( (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(-2-2) ) = (-2*1) - (3*(-4)) = -2 + 12 = 10\n\n                Both positive, so condition (o3*o4 < 0) fails.\n\n            Therefore, no crossing.\n\n            Now, check Edge1 and Edge3, and Edge2 and Edge3.\n\n            Edge1 and Edge3: (0,0)-(-2,1) and (3,1)-(2,2)\n                orient( (0,0), (-2,1), (3,1) ) = (-2-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(3-0) = (-2*1) - (1*3) = -2-3 = -5\n                orient( (0,0), (-2,1), (2,2) ) = (-2-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) = (-2*2) - (1*2) = -4-2 = -6\n                (product positive) -> no crossing from first condition.\n\n                Now the other condition:\n                orient( (3,1), (2,2), (0,0) ) = (2-3)*(0-1) - (2-1)*(0-3) = (-1)*(-1) - (1)*(-3) = 1 + 3 = 4\n                orient( (3,1), (2,2), (-2,1) ) = (2-3)*(1-1) - (2-1)*(-2-3) = (-1)*0 - (1)*(-5) = 0+5 = 5\n                (product positive) -> no crossing.\n\n            Edge2 and Edge3: (2,0)-(0,3) and (3,1)-(2,2)\n                Condition for Edge2: (2,0) to (0,3); Edge3: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\n                orient( (2,0), (0,3), (3,1) ) = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-2) = (-2*1) - (3*1) = -2-3 = -5\n                orient( (2,0), (0,3), (2,2) ) = (0-2)*(2-0) - (3-0)*(2-2) = (-2*2) - (3*0) = -4\n\n                (product positive) -> no crossing.\n\n                Condition for Edge3: (3,1) to (2,2); and Edge2: (2,0) to (0,3)\n                orient( (3,1), (2,2), (2,0) ) = (2-3)*(0-1) - (2-1)*(2-3) = (-1)*(-1) - (1)*(-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n                orient( (3,1), (2,2), (0,3) ) = (2-3)*(3-1) - (2-1)*(0-3) = (-1)*2 - (1)*(-3) = -2 + 3 = 1\n                (product positive) -> no crossing.\n\n            So the identity permutation is valid.\n\n            But wait: the example input says the first example outputs 'Yes'.

We are reading the entire stdin.\n\n            Actually, the problem says: the first line contains R, B, then R lines, then B lines.\n\n            But the example input is provided as two separate strings. However, in competitive programming, the input is given as one stream.\n\n            Since the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the example input is given as two strings, but we are to read from stdin.\n\n           ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between the spaceships and bases to see if any permutation satisfies the non-intersecting condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a perfect matching (one-to-one assignment) between R spaceships and B bases. The key constraint is that the straight-line segments connecting each spaceship to its base must not intersect. The solution hinges on verifying this condition for all possible permutations of assignments when R equals B; otherwise, it's impossible to form a perfect matching.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each permutation of base assignments, we need to ensure that no two segments (from different spaceships to their bases) intersect. This involves checking the orientation of points to determine if segments cross each other.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Permutation Generation**: Generate all possible permutations of base assignments for the spaceships.\n   - **Segment Intersection Check**: For each permutation, check every pair of segments to see if they intersect using the cross product method to determine orientations.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm's complexity is O(R! * R^2), where R is the number of spaceships and bases (since R = B). Given the constraints (R, B ≤ 10), this approach is feasible as 10! is 3,628,800, and each permutation requires checking up to 45 segment pairs (for R=10).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    try:\n        R = int(first_line[0])\n        B = int(first_line[1])\n    except Exception:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    points = []\n    index = 1\n    for i in range(R + B):\n        if index >= len(data):\n            break\n        parts = data[index].split()\n        x = int(parts[0])\n        y = int(parts[1])\n        points.append((x, y))\n        index += 1\n        \n    rebels = points[:R]\n    bases = points[R:]\n    \n    def orient(a, b, c):\n        return (b[0] - a[0]) * (c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1]) * (c[0] - a[0])\n    \n    def segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n        o1 = orient(a, b, c)\n        o2 = orient(a, b, d)\n        o3 = orient(c, d, a)\n        o4 = orient(c, d, b)\n        return (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(B):\n            for j in range(i + 1, B):\n                seg1 = (rebels[i], bases[perm[i]])\n                seg2 = (rebels[j], bases[perm[j]])\n                if segments_intersect(seg1[0], seg1[1], seg2[0], seg2[1]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n            \n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), followed by their coordinates.\n2. **Initial Checks**: If R does not equal B, output \"No\" immediately since a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Permutation Check**: For each permutation of base assignments, the code checks if any two segments (from spaceships to bases) intersect.
