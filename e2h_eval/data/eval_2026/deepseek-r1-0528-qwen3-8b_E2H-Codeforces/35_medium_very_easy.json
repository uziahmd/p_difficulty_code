    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given:\n   n: an integer (the number of array elements)\n   a list of n integers a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}\n   a string s of length n (without spaces) which is the binary representation of m (with no leading zeros, but note: the string might have leading zeros? Actually, the problem says: \"the binary representation of number m\" and then gives an example: for n=4 and x=11, they use 4 bits. However, note that the input for m is given as a string of n digits (each either '0' or '1').\n\n But note: the example input says:\n   Input: \n        2\n        3 8\n        10\n\n   Here, n=2, array a = [3,8], and m is represented by the binary string \"10\", which is 2 in decimal.\n\n However, note that the function f(x) is defined for x in the range [0, 2^n - 1]. The problem states that the binary representation of x has exactly n bits? Actually, the function f(x) uses the first n bits (from bit0 to bit_{n-1}) of x. But note: the example with n=4 and x=11 (which is 1011 in binary) is represented using 4 bits.\n\n Important: the input for m is given as a string of n digits (each '0' or '1'). This means we know the bit-length is n.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are to consider all x such that 0 <= x <= m, where m is given by the binary string (of length n).\n\n 2. The function f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (bit(i) ? a_i : 0). In other words, if the i-th bit of x is set, then we add a_i.\n\n 3. We want the maximum value of f(x) for x in [0, m].\n\n Observation:\n\n Since we are only concerned with the first n bits (because the array a has n elements), we can think of x as an n-bit number (possibly with leading zeros). But note: the binary representation of m is given as a string of length n, so m is in the range [0, 2^n - 1].\n\n However, note: the problem says m is given by the binary representation s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. So m = s0*2^(n-1) + s1*2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1}*2^0.\n\n How to solve?\n\n We cannot iterate over all numbers from 0 to m because m can be up to 2^n - 1 and n can be up to 10^5.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider that the function f(x) is linear in the bits: each bit i (from least significant to most significant) contributes a_i if the bit is set.\n\n We wish to choose an x (with n bits) such that x <= m and the sum of the a_i for which the bit is set is maximized.\n\n This is similar to a knapsack problem where each item (bit) has weight 1 (but actually we are constrained by the bits of m) and value a_i, but with the condition that we cannot set a bit if it would make x exceed m.\n\n However, note: the bits are independent and the constraint is that the entire number x must be <= m.\n\n We can use a greedy/dynamic programming method but n can be up to 10^5, so we need an efficient way.\n\n Idea: process the bits from the most significant to the least significant (like the binary representation of m) and decide whether to set a bit or not.\n\n But note: the standard digit DP (dynamic programming) for numbers up to m has state (position, tight) and we can try to maximize the sum.\n\n Steps for DP:\n\n Let dp[i][tight] = the maximum sum we can achieve from the i-th bit (most significant) to the last (least significant) when we are in state 'tight' (meaning whether the prefix is equal to the prefix of m or not).\n\n However, n can be 10^5 and the state is two states (tight or not) and we traverse n bits, so total states 2*n, which is acceptable.\n\n But note: the values a_i are nonnegative, and we have two choices for each bit (if tight, we might be forced to choose a bit that is <= the corresponding bit in m). However, the value for setting a bit is a_i (for the i-th element, but note: the array a is given for indices 0 to n-1. How do we map the bits?\n\n Important: the problem defines the binary representation of x as having n bits, and the i-th position (in the formula) is the i-th bit. However, the array a is indexed from a0 to a_{n-1}. \n\n But note: the example: \n   n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> f(x)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n In the example, the bits are numbered from 0 to 3 (so the least significant bit is bit0 and the most significant is bit3). \n\n However, the binary string for m is given as s0s1...s_{n-1}. In the example, m=10 (binary string of length 2) for the first sample. Then the array a has two elements: [3,8]. \n\n For x in [0,2]: \n   x=0: binary 00 -> bits: bit0=0, bit1=0 -> f(0)=0.\n   x=1: binary 01 -> bit0=1, bit1=0 -> f(1)=a0=3.\n   x=2: binary 10 -> bit0=0, bit1=1 -> f(2)=a1=8.\n\n But wait, the example says m=20 (which is 2 in decimal) and the binary representation is \"10\", meaning the most significant bit is the left one. \n\n Therefore, the binary string for m is given in the usual big-endian order (the first character is the most significant). \n\n However, the function f(x) uses the bits: \n   bit0 corresponds to the least significant bit (rightmost) of x, and bit_{n-1} corresponds to the most significant (leftmost).\n\n So, when we read the array a, the index 0 corresponds to the least significant bit (bit0) and index n-1 corresponds to the most significant (bit_{n-1}).\n\n But wait, in the example: \n   n=4, x=11 (binary 1011) -> bits: \n        bit0 (LSB): 1 -> a0\n        bit1: 1 -> a1\n        bit2: 0 -> a2\n        bit3 (MSB): 1 -> a3\n\n And the array a is [a0, a1, a2, a3] = [3,8,...] but wait, in the example the array a is [3,8] for n=2, and the bits are assigned as:\n        bit0: a0 (LSB) and bit1: a1 (MSB) for n=2.\n\n So the array a is given in the order from least significant bit (index0) to most significant bit (index n-1).\n\n Now, the binary representation of m is given as a string of length n (without spaces). The first character of the string is the most significant bit (which corresponds to a_{n-1}), and the last character is the least significant (which corresponds to a_0).\n\n Therefore, to align the bits, we can reverse the array a so that the i-th element in the reversed array corresponds to the bit at position i (where i=0 is the least significant). Alternatively, we can process the string from left to right (most significant to least significant) and the array a from last element to first.\n\n However, let's reframe:\n\n Let the binary string for m be s[0] s[1] ... s[n-1] (each s[i] is either '0' or '1'). Then:\n\n   m = s[0]*2^(n-1) + s[1]*2^(n-2) + ... + s[n-1]*2^0.\n\n And the function f(x) for x (also represented in n bits) is:\n\n   x = b[0]*2^(n-1) + b[1]*2^(n-2) + ... + b[n-1]*2^0.\n\n   Then f(x) = (if b[0] then a_{n-1}) + (if b[1] then a_{n-2}) + ... + (if b[n-1] then a_0)\n\n But wait: in the example, n=2, m=\"10\", so m = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\n Then for x, we have two bits: \n   b0 (most significant) and b1 (least significant). Then f(x) = (if b0 then a_{1}) + (if b1 then a_0).\n\n However, the example array a is [3,8]. Then:\n   x=0: bits 00 -> 0\n   x=1: bits 01 -> (if b0=0, then skip a1; b1=1, then add a0=3) -> 3\n   x=2: bits 10 -> (b0=1, then a1=8; b1=0) -> 8\n   x=3: bits 11 -> 8+3=11, but note: m=2, so x=3 is not allowed.\n\n Therefore, the maximum is 8.\n\n But the example output says: \n        Input: \n            2\n            3 8\n            10\n\n        Output: 3\n\n Why? Because the example says: \"In the first test case m = 20 = 2, f(0)=0, f(1)=3, f(2)=8.\" Then the maximum is 8? \n\n Wait, the example output is 3, but wait: the example input says:\n\n        ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n And the expected outputs are:\n\n        ['3', '27']\n\n So the first sample output is 3, not 8.\n\n Let me check the example again:\n\n        Input: \n            2\n            3 8\n            10\n\n        The example says: \"f(0)=0, f(1)=3\". \n\n        But note: the problem says \"the binary representation of number m\" is given without spaces. For n=2, m is represented by two digits? \n\n        The example says m=20. But wait, 20 in binary is '10', but that is two digits. Then the numbers x we consider are from 0 to 20 (inclusive)? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1...sn-1\" — that is, the binary representation of m. \n\n        But note: the example says m=20. However, 20 in base-10 is 2, and its binary representation is \"10\", which is two digits. So the problem is using the binary representation of m, and m is given in base-10? \n\n        Actually, the third line is the binary representation of m. So m is 2 (decimal) because the binary string \"10\" is 2.\n\n        Therefore, x can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n        Then:\n            x=0: 0 -> f(0)=0\n            x=1: binary representation (using 2 bits) is \"01\" -> then the bits are: \n                    bit0 (LSB): 1 -> so we take a0 = 3\n                    bit1 (MSB): 0 -> so we don't take a1 = 8\n                f(1)=3\n            x=2: binary representation (using 2 bits) is \"10\" -> then the bits are:\n                    bit0 (LSB): 0 -> skip a0\n                    bit1 (MSB): 1 -> take a1 = 8\n                f(2)=8\n\n        But wait, the example says: \"f(0)=0, f(1)=3\". It does not mention f(2). \n\n        However, the example output is 3, but we just computed f(2)=8 which is larger than 3.\n\n        There seems to be a contradiction.\n\n Let me read the problem statement again: \n\n        \"Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.\"\n\n        And the example: \"if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.\"\n\n        Note: the example uses n=4, and the bits are numbered from 0 to 3. The binary representation of 11 (which is 1011) has:\n            bit0: 1 (LSB)\n            bit1: 1\n            bit2: 0\n            bit3: 1 (MSB)\n\n        So the i-th bit is the coefficient for 2^i. The problem does not specify the order of the bits in the array a. \n\n        But then the example says: \"For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.\"\n\n        This implies that the array a is given for the bits in increasing order of the exponent? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [bit(i) * a_i]\n\n        and the bit(i) is the i-th bit (which is the coefficient for 2^i). \n\n        In the example, x=11, which is 8+2+1 = 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0. But wait, 11 = 8+2+1 = 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0, so the bits set are i=0, i=1, i=3.\n\n        Then the function adds a0, a1, and a3.\n\n        So the array a is indexed by the exponent i (from 0 to n-1). \n\n        Therefore, the array a is given in the order of increasing exponents (so a0 corresponds to 2^0, a1 to 2^1, ..., a_{n-1} to 2^{n-1}).\n\n        Now, the input for m is given as a binary string of length n. How does this relate to the exponents?\n\n        The number m is represented by the string s0 s1 ... s_{n-1} (each s_i is '0' or '1'). Then:\n\n            m = s0 * 2^(n-1) + s1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1} * 2^0.\n\n        But wait, that is the usual big-endian representation. However, our function f(x) is defined by the exponents (which correspond to the power of 2). \n\n        Now, let's compare:\n\n        Example n=2, m=2 (binary \"10\"): \n            m = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\n        Then the binary representation of m is \"10\", meaning the most significant bit (which is the bit for 2^1) is set, and the least significant (2^0) is not.\n\n        Now, for x, we have two bits: \n            Let x be represented as (b0, b1) for exponents 2^0 and 2^1? \n\n        Actually, the standard binary representation: \n            x = b0 * 2^0 + b1 * 2^1.\n\n        But the input string for m is given in the same way: the first character is the highest power (2^(n-1)) and the last is the lowest (2^0).\n\n        Therefore, the i-th character in the string (0-indexed) corresponds to the bit for exponent 2^(n-1-i).\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n            Let the binary representation of x (with n bits) be c0 c1 ... c_{n-1} (c0 being the most significant, c_{n-1} the least). Then:\n\n            x = c0 * 2^(n-1) + c1 * 2^(n-2) + ... + c_{n-1} * 2^0.\n\n        Then the function f(x) = \n            if c0 is set, then we add a_{n-1} (because the exponent is 2^(n-1) and the index in a for exponent 2^(n-1) is n-1)\n            if c1 is set, then we add a_{n-2}\n            ...\n            if c_{n-1} is set, then we add a_0.\n\n        So the array a is given from a0 (for 2^0) to a_{n-1} (for 2^(n-1)). \n\n        Therefore, the i-th element in the array a (a_i) corresponds to the bit that is the coefficient for 2^i. \n\n        Now, when we look at the binary representation of x (as a string of n bits) from left to right (most significant to least significant):\n\n            The first character (leftmost) is the bit for 2^(n-1) -> so we use a_{n-1} for that bit.\n            The second character (next) is the bit for 2^(n-2) -> a_{n-2}\n            ...\n            The last character (rightmost) is the bit for 2^0 -> a_0.\n\n        Therefore, we can reverse the array a so that the i-th element in the reversed array corresponds to the bit at the (n-1-i)-th position (i.e., the exponent i).\n\n        Alternatively, we can keep the array a as is and then when processing the string (from left to right) we use a from the end.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let m_str = the input string (without spaces) of length n.\n\n        Then we can define an array b of coefficients for the bits (from most significant to least significant) as:\n            coeff[0] = a_{n-1}   [for the first character of m_str]\n            coeff[1] = a_{n-2}\n            ...\n            coeff[i] = a_{n-1-i}\n\n        Then the problem becomes: we have a binary number m (given by m_str) and we wish to choose a number x (with n bits) such that x <= m and the sum of the coefficients for the set bits (according to the order of the bits) is maximized.\n\n        But note: the set bits in x (in the n-bit representation) are independent, but the constraint is that the entire number must be <= m.\n\n        We can use a digit DP (or greedy) that processes the bits from the most significant to the least significant.\n\n        Let's define:\n\n            dp[i][tight] = the maximum sum we can achieve from the i-th bit (from most significant, i=0 to n-1) to the end, given that we are in state 'tight' (0 or 1) meaning whether the prefix is equal to the prefix of m.\n\n        Transition:\n\n            At bit i (0-indexed from most significant to least significant), we have two choices: set the bit or not.\n\n            But note: if we are in tight state, then we cannot set a bit to 1 if the corresponding bit in m is 0, because then the number would exceed m.\n\n            However, if we set a bit to 0 when the corresponding bit in m is 1 and we are in tight state, then we become not tight.\n\n            Steps for bit i (0-indexed, from most significant to least significant):\n\n            Let the current bit in m_str be m_bit = int(m_str[i])\n            Let the coefficient for this bit (from the array a) be: coeff_i = a[n-1-i]   (since the array a is [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}] and the most significant bit uses a_{n-1}, then the next a_{n-2}, etc.)\n\n            Option 1: set the bit to 0.\n                Then the contribution is 0, and the tight state remains the same if we are already not tight, or becomes not tight if we were tight and we set a bit to 0 while m_bit is 1? Actually, if we are tight and we set the bit to 0 and m_bit is 1, then the rest can be arbitrary (so we become not tight). If we are tight and we set the bit to 0 and m_bit is 0, then we remain tight. If we are not tight, then we remain not tight.\n\n            Option 2: set the bit to 1.\n                Then we can only do this if we are not tight OR if we are tight and m_bit is 1 (because if m_bit is 0 and we set to 1, then we exceed m). \n                If we set to 1 and we are tight and m_bit is 1, then we remain tight for the next bits.\n                If we set to 1 and we are tight and m_bit is 0, then we cannot do this (because we exceed m).\n\n            Then we take the maximum of the two options (if both are allowed).\n\n        However, note: the coefficients are positive, so we would like to set a bit if the coefficient is positive. But sometimes we are forced by the constraint to set a bit to 0 even if the coefficient is positive, or we can set a bit to 1 even if the coefficient is negative? But the problem states that a_i are nonnegative (0 <= a_i <= 10^4). So we always gain by setting a bit.\n\n        But wait: if we set a bit to 1, we get the coefficient, but if we are tight and the m_bit is 0, we cannot set it. Otherwise, we can.\n\n        However, what if we skip a positive coefficient bit (set to 0) because we are tight and m_bit is 0? Then we cannot set it. But then maybe in the future we can set more bits? Actually, if we set a bit to 0 when m_bit is 0 and we are tight, we must set it to 0 and remain tight.\n\n        But note: the goal is to maximize the sum.\n\n        Since the coefficients are positive, we prefer to set a bit if we can. However, sometimes we might have to set a bit to 0 (because we are tight and the m_bit is 0) and then we cannot set any more bits arbitrarily, but if we set it to 1 we would exceed.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            Let m_str = input string (length n)\n            Let a = list of n integers.\n\n            We'll create an array `coeff` of length n, where:\n                coeff[i] = a[n-1-i]   # because the i-th character (0-indexed) in m_str (most significant) corresponds to the (n-1-i)-th element in a (which is the coefficient for 2^(n-1-i))\n\n            Then we do:\n\n                dp[i][tight] = maximum sum from bit i to the end, given the tight state.\n\n            Base case: i == n, then return 0.\n\n            For state (i, tight):\n                Let m_bit = int(m_str[i])\n                Let c = coeff[i]   # the coefficient for this bit\n\n                If tight is True, then the current bit can be at most m_bit.\n\n                Option 1: set the bit to 0.\n                    Then the next state: \n                        If tight is True and we set to 0 and m_bit==0, then next_tight = True.\n                        If tight is True and we set to 0 and m_bit==1, then next_tight = False.\n                        If tight is False, then next_tight = False.\n\n                    Then the value is 0 + dp(i+1, next_tight)\n\n                Option 2: set the bit to 1 (if allowed)\n                    If tight is True, then we can only set to 1 if m_bit==1, then next_tight = (if m_bit==1 then we set to 1, so we remain tight only if we set to 1 and m_bit==1? Actually, if we set to 1 and m_bit==1, then the prefix is still matching, so next_tight = True. But if we set to 1 and m_bit==0, then we break the constraint (so we cannot do that).\n                    If tight is False, then we can set to 1 without any constraint, and next_tight remains False.\n\n                    Then the value is c + dp(i+1, next_tight)\n\n                Then dp(i, tight) = max( value from option1, value from option2 (if allowed) )\n\n            Then the answer is dp(0, True)\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to set a bit to 1 only if it doesn't break the constraint. But wait, if we are tight and m_bit is 0, then we cannot set the bit to 1. So we only consider setting to 1 if (tight and m_bit==1) OR (not tight).\n\n        But note: the array `coeff` is defined for the i-th bit (from most significant) as the coefficient for the bit that is the (n-1-i)-th in the original array a.\n\n        However, the problem: the constraints say n can be up to 10^5. The DP state has two states (tight or not) and we do two transitions per state, so total operations 2*n, which is acceptable.\n\n        But we must avoid recursion depth issues. We can do iterative DP.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a greedy method: since the coefficients are positive, we want to set as many high-value bits as possible, but the constraint is that the entire number must be <= m.\n\n        However, note: the value of a bit (the coefficient) does not depend on the position in the binary representation but on the index in the array a. But the array a is given arbitrarily. \n\n        But wait, the coefficient for the most significant bit is a_{n-1}, which might be very large or small. Similarly, the least significant bit is a_0.\n\n        Since the bits are independent in terms of value (but the constraint is on the entire number) we cannot simply choose the largest coefficients first. \n\n        Example: \n            n=3, m=5 (binary \"101\")\n            a = [1, 100, 1]   # so the coefficients for the bits (from most significant to least significant) are [1, 100, 1]\n\n            Then the number m is 101 (binary) = 5.\n\n            We wish to maximize the sum. The bits are:\n\n                Bit0 (most significant): coefficient 1 -> corresponds to 2^2\n                Bit1: coefficient 100 -> 2^1\n                Bit2 (least): coefficient 1 -> 2^0\n\n            What are the possibilities?\n\n            We can set the bits arbitrarily as long as the number <= 5.\n\n            Possibilities:\n\n                x=0: 0 -> sum=0\n                x=1: 001 -> set the least significant bit: 1 -> sum=1\n                x=2: 010 -> set the middle bit: 100\n                x=3: 011 -> 100+1=101\n                x=4: 100 -> set the most significant bit: 1 -> 1\n                x=5: 101 -> set the most and least: 1+1=2\n\n            The maximum is 101 (x=3).\n\n            Now, if we use DP:\n\n                Let m_str = \"101\", n=3, coeff = [a[2], a[1], a[0]] = [1, 100, 1]\n\n                dp(0, True): \n                    i=0, tight=True, m_bit='1'\n                    Option1: set bit0=0 -> then next_tight: since tight and set 0 and m_bit=1 -> becomes not tight.

Then if we set 1 and m_bit is 1, we stay tight. If we set 1 and m_bit is 0, then we break the constraint (so not allowed).\n\n                    If tight is False, then we can set 1 without any constraint and we stay not tight.\n\n                We'll use:\n\n                    dp[i][tight] for i from n-1 downto 0, and for each state.\n\n                We can use two variables for the next state: dp_tight and dp_not_tight for the next bit (i+1) and then update.\n\n                Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                    dp[i][0] = maximum sum from bit i to the end when not tight.\n                    dp[i][1] = maximum sum from bit i to the end when tight.\n\n                Then:\n\n                    Let m_bit = int(m_str[i])   (but note: we are processing from most significant to least, so the i-th character is the i-th in the string)\n\n                    For state tight=1 (dp[i][1]):\n                        Option1: set bit to 0 -> then next_tight0: \n                            if m_bit==0: then next_tight = 1 (because we set 0 and m_bit=0, so the prefix is still matching)\n                            if m_bit==1: then next_tight = 0 (because we set 0 and m_bit=1, so the prefix is now less than m's prefix)\n\n                        Then value0 = 0 + dp[i+1][next_tight0]\n\n                        Option2: set bit to 1 -> then if m_bit==",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of \\( x \\). The binary representation of \\( x \\) is considered to have exactly \\( n \\) bits, where \\( n \\) is the number of elements in the array \\( a \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the function \\( f(x) \\) sums specific elements of the array \\( a \\) based on the bits set in \\( x \\). The challenge is to determine the optimal \\( x \\) (≤ \\( m \\)) that maximizes this sum. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we use dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently explore the solution space.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We process each bit from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit, we consider two states: whether the current prefix of \\( x \\) matches the corresponding prefix of \\( m \\) (tight constraint) or not (loose constraint). The DP state transitions involve deciding whether to set the current bit to 0 or 1, ensuring the resulting \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\).\n\n3. **State Transitions**:\n   - **Tight State**: If the current prefix matches \\( m \\)'s prefix, setting a bit to 1 is only allowed if \\( m \\)'s corresponding bit is 1. Otherwise, setting it to 0 keeps the tight state if \\( m \\)'s bit is 0, or transitions to loose state if \\( m \\)'s bit is 1.\n   - **Loose State**: If the current prefix is already less than \\( m \\)'s prefix, any bit can be set without violating the constraint, and the state remains loose.\n\n4. **Coefficient Handling**: The array \\( a \\) is transformed such that each element corresponds to the bit position's contribution. This transformation aligns the array elements with the bit positions in \\( x \\)'s binary representation.\n\n5. **Base Case**: When all bits are processed, the sum is zero. The solution is derived by evaluating the DP states from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    m_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    coeff = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        coeff[i] = a_list[n-1-i]\n    \n    dp_tight = [0] * (n+1)\n    dp_loose = [0] * (n+1)\n    \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        m_bit = int(m_str[i])\n        c = coeff[i]\n        next_dp_tight = dp_tight[i+1]\n        next_dp_loose = dp_loose[i+1]\n        \n        option0_tight = 0 + next_dp_loose if m_bit == 1 else 0 + next_dp_tight\n        option1_tight = -10**18\n        if m_bit == 1:\n            option1_tight = c + next_dp_tight\n        elif m_bit == 0:\n            option1_tight = -10**18\n        \n        dp_tight[i] = max(option0_tight, option1_tight)\n        \n        option0_loose = c + next_dp_loose\n        option1_loose = c + next_dp_loose\n        dp_loose[i] = max(option0_loose, option1_loose)\n    \n    result = dp_tight[0]\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n2. **Coefficient Calculation**: The array \\( a \\) is reversed to align its elements with the bit positions in \\( x \\)'s binary representation.\n3. **DP Initialization**: Two DP arrays, `dp_tight` and `dp_loose`, are initialized to store the maximum sum achievable from each bit position under tight and loose constraints, respectively.\n4. **Backward Processing**: Starting from the least significant bit to the most significant bit, the DP states are updated based on whether the current bit can be set to 0 or 1 without exceeding \\( m \\).\n5. **Result Extraction**: The result is derived from the initial state (`dp_tight[0]`), which considers the entire number under the tight constraint, ensuring \\( x \\leq m \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the solution space using dynamic programming, leveraging bit manipulation and state transitions to maximize the sum while adhering to the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\).",
