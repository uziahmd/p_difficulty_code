After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are reading the first line to get n and m.\n Then, we read the next n lines, each containing a string of m characters (without spaces).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll read the input as described.\n 2. For each subject (column), we can determine the maximum mark that appears in that subject.\n    Since the marks are from 1 to 9, but note: if there are multiple same maximums, then all those students are best in that subject?\n    However, note: the problem says \"best\" means no student has a higher mark. So if two have the same highest, then both are best.\n\n 3. But note: we need to count a student as successful if there is at least one subject in which they are the best.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   - For each subject j, let max_j be the maximum mark in that column.\n   - Then, for each student i, check for any subject j such that the mark of student i in subject j equals max_j.\n\n However, note: the input is given as:\n   First line: \"n m\"\n   Then n lines, each with m characters (so each line is a string of length m)\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112\"\n\n   We can represent the gradebook as a list of strings, or we can make a 2D list of integers? But the problem says marks are from 1 to 9.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n   n, m = 3, 3\n   grades = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n   We can convert each string to a list of integers if we want, but actually we can work with characters.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Read n and m.\n\n   Step 2: Read the next n lines.\n\n   Step 3: For each subject (each column index j from 0 to m-1), find the maximum character (since characters are digits) in that column.\n\n   Step 4: For each student i, check if there exists at least one subject j such that:\n        grades[i][j] == max_j   (where max_j is the maximum for subject j)\n\n   However, wait: what if there are multiple students having the maximum? Then the condition holds for that subject for all of them.\n\n   But note: we don't need to know which subject, just that there's at least one.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n   Let's create a list `max_marks` for each subject (each column) so that max_marks[j] is the maximum in column j.\n\n   Then, for each student i (row i), we can check for any subject j (column j) if the student's mark in that subject is equal to max_marks[j].\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the input might have the same maximum appearing in multiple subjects, but that doesn't matter.\n\n   Example: \n        Student 0: [2,2,3] -> Check subject0: 2 vs max0 (which is 2) -> yes, so this student is successful? But wait, note the example output is 2.\n\n        Actually, the example: \n          Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n          Students (0-indexed):\n            Student0: \"223\" -> [2,2,3]\n            Student1: \"232\" -> [2,3,2]\n            Student2: \"112\" -> [1,1,2]\n\n          For subject0: max is '3'? Wait, no: the first column is the first character of each string.\n\n          Actually, the input order is rows as students and columns as subjects.\n\n          The example says: \n            Student1 (index0) is best at subjects1 and3? \n\n          Let me clarify the example: \n            The example input is written as:\n                223\n                232\n                112\n\n          This means:\n            Subject1: [2,2,1] -> max is 2 -> best students: student0 and student1.\n            Subject2: [2,3,1] -> max is 3 -> best student: student1.\n            Subject3: [3,2,2] -> max is 3 -> best student: student0.\n\n          Therefore, student0 is best in subject3, student1 is best in subject2, and student2 is not best in any.\n\n          But wait, the example output is 2, meaning two successful students: student0 and student1.\n\n          However, note: the example says \"student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3\", but in our 0-indexing, student0 is the first.\n\n          Also, the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The subsequent `n` lines each contain a string of `m` characters representing the marks of each student in each subject.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), find the highest mark achieved by any student. This involves iterating through each column and keeping track of the maximum value encountered.\n3. **Check Student Success**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If a student has the highest mark in at least one subject, they are counted as successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    grades = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        grades.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_max = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            mark = int(grades[i][j])\n            if mark > col_max:\n                col_max = mark\n        max_marks[j] = col_max\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if int(grades[i][j]) == max_marks[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count_successful += 1\n            \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. The first line is split into `n` and `m`, representing the number of students and subjects, respectively. The next `n` lines are read as strings representing each student's marks.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code iterates through all students' marks to find the highest value in that subject. This value is stored in an array `max_marks`.\n3. **Checking Student Success**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark (`max_marks`) for that subject. If it does, the student is marked as successful. The total count of successful students is then printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success status, leveraging simple iteration and comparison operations. The solution handles edge cases such as all students having the same marks or no students being successful by naturally extending the logic.",
