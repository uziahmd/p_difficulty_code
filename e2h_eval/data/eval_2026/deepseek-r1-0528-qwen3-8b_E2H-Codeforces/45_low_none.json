There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are given an integer n (number of players) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\nIn a knockout tournament with n players, there will be exactly n-1 games in total. However, the winner is the one who wins all his/her games until the final. But note: the rule says two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\nWe are to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\nObservation:\n\nLet k be the number of games the winner plays. Then the winner must win k consecutive games.\n\nBut the structure of the tournament is constrained by the rule that two players can only play if their previous game counts differ by at most one.\n\nWe can think of building a bracket that allows the winner to play as many games as possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the tournament as a binary tree? But note: the rule is about the number of games played (i.e., the depth in terms of wins) between two players.\n\nAnother approach: consider that the tournament progresses in rounds, but the rule might allow for a non-standard scheduling. However, note that the winner must not face a player until he has played at most one game more or less than the opponent.\n\nWe can also consider that the maximum number of games the winner can play is achieved when we have a balanced bracket. But note: sometimes we cannot have a perfect binary tree.\n\nLet's try small cases:\n\nn = 2 -> winner plays 1 game.\nn = 3 -> winner plays 2 games (beats two players in two consecutive games). But wait, how? Actually, the rule says that two players can play only if their previous games differ by at most one.\n\nLet me explain the sample: \nInput 3 -> Output 2.\n\nBut with 3 players: \n- We can have the winner play the first game against one player. Then the winner has 1 game, and the remaining player has 0. Now, can the winner play the remaining player? The rule says: the number of games the winner has (1) and the remaining player (0) differ by 1, so yes. Then the winner plays 2 games.\n\nBut wait, what if we have n=4?\nInput 4 -> Output 2.\n\nWith 4 players: \nWe can have two semifinals: (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4). Then the winner (say 1) has 1 game, and then plays the winner of the other semifinal (which is 3 or 4, say 3) so that's the second game. Then the winner (1) has 2 games. \n\nBut note: after the semifinals, the two winners (1 and 3) have each played 1 game. So they can play because the difference is 0. Then the winner would play 2 games.\n\nHowever, is it possible to have the winner play more than 2 games in a 4-player tournament? Let's see: \nTo get 3 games, the winner would have to beat 3 opponents. But then the tournament must have at least 4 players (since the winner must beat 3 others). However, with 4 players, the total number of games is 3, but the winner only plays 2. Why?\n\nActually, in a knockout tournament, the winner must defeat log2(n) opponents approximately, but the exact number is the depth of the tree.\n\nBut note: the tournament doesn't necessarily have to be a complete binary tree. However, the rule restricts the scheduling.\n\nWe can model the tournament as having two halves: one half for players that have played fewer games and the other for those that have played more, but the constraint is that the difference is at most one.\n\nAnother way: think of the tournament as having rounds. In round 0, no one has played. Then in round 1, the winner must play one game. Then in round 2, the winner can play again (if there is someone available who has played at most one game) and so on.\n\nBut note: the entire tournament must be arranged such that the winner can keep playing.\n\nWe can use a recursive or iterative method to determine the maximum k (number of games) such that the tournament can be arranged.\n\nLet f(k) be the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games under the given rule.\n\nHow does the tournament progress for the winner?\n\n- Before the first game, the winner has 0 games.\n- After the first game, the winner has 1 game, and one other player (the one he beat) is eliminated.\n\nNow, to play the second game, the winner must face a player that has either 0 or 1 game. But note: the other players that haven't played any games (if any) can be used. However, the rule also applies to the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the tournament structure must allow the winner to play as many games as possible while adhering to the given constraint. The solution involves finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the total number of players required for the winner to play \\( k \\) games does not exceed \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Insight**: The tournament can be modeled by considering that each game the winner plays requires a certain number of players. Specifically:\n   - For the first game, 1 opponent is needed.\n   - For the second game, 2 additional players (since the winner must face someone who has played at most one game).\n   - In general, for the \\( k \\)-th game, \\( 2^{k-1} \\) players are needed beyond those from previous rounds.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a mathematical approach to compute the minimum number of players required for the winner to play \\( k \\) games. The total players required for \\( k \\) games is \\( 2^k - 1 \\). However, since the problem allows a slightly different structure (as seen in examples), we adjust our calculation to account for cases where the number of players is not exactly \\( 2^k - 1 \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm efficiently checks possible values of \\( k \\) using binary search or iterative methods, ensuring it handles the constraints (where \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^{18} \\)) without excessive computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    low = 1\n    high = n\n    \n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        players_needed = (1 << mid) - 1\n        if players_needed < n:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n            \n    k = high\n    \n    # Check if the winner can play k+1 games?\n    if (1 << (k + 1)) - 1 < n:\n        k += 1\n        \n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of players \\( n \\) from standard input.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If there are only 2 players, the winner plays 1 game, which is directly printed.\n3. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is initialized with `low` set to 1 and `high` set to \\( n \\), representing the range of possible games the winner could play.\n4. **Binary Search Execution**: The loop adjusts `low` and `high` based on whether the current midpoint `mid` requires fewer or more players than available. The condition checks if \\( 2^{\\text{mid}} - 1 \\) (the minimum players needed for `mid` games) is less than \\( n \\).\n5. **Result Adjustment**: After the loop, `high` holds the maximum number of games \\( k \\) such that \\( 2^k - 1 \\leq n \\). If \\( 2^{k+1} - 1 \\) is still less than \\( n \\), \\( k \\) is incremented.\n6. **Output**: The result \\( k \\) is printed, representing the maximum number of games the winner can participate in.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible number of games using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for very large \\( n \\).",
