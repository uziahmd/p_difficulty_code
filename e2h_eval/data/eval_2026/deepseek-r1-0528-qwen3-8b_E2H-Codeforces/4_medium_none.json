The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are counting the number of red spots for both players.\n Since each loss gives one red spot, we can count the number of rounds in which Nikephoros lost and the number of rounds in which Polycarpus lost.\n\n However, note: the total rounds is n, and each round uses one element from A (cyclically) and one from B (cyclically).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We have two sequences: A (length m) and B (length k). The games are played for n rounds.\n\n 2. We can break down the problem by considering the cycles. The i-th round (0-indexed) uses:\n        A_index = i % m\n        B_index = i % k\n\n 3. But n can be up to 2·10^9, so we cannot iterate over each round.\n\n 4. Instead, we can consider the periodicity of the two sequences. The combined period would be the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k? \n    However, note that we are using two independent cycles. But wait: the same index i will map to (i mod m, i mod k). The sequence of pairs (a_i, b_i) repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\n 5. Let T = LCM(m, k). Then the entire game pattern repeats every T rounds.\n\n 6. We can precompute the outcome for one full cycle (T rounds) and then multiply the counts by the number of full cycles (n // T) and then add the remainder (n % T) rounds.\n\n 7. But note: T might be too large because m, k <= 1000, so T <= 1000*1000 / gcd(1000,1000) = 1000*1000 = 1e6, but actually LCM(m,k) = m*k // gcd(m,k). The maximum m*k is 1e6, which is acceptable if we do a single cycle of 1e6 rounds. But n can be 2e9 and T might be up to 1000*1000 (which is 1e6), then the number of full cycles is about 2000 (if T=1e6, then 2e9 / 1e6 = 2000). However, we are going to simulate T rounds (which is 1e6) and then multiply by the number of full cycles (which is 2000) and then simulate the remaining rounds. But 2000 * 1e6 is 2e9, which is too many rounds to simulate again.\n\n 8. Actually, we should avoid simulating the entire cycle if we are going to use the cycle to compute the outcomes. We can instead:\n\n    a. Precompute the outcome for all pairs (x, y) where x in A and y in B? Actually, we know the rules:\n\n        Rock ('R'): beats 'S', loses to 'P', draw with 'R'\n        Scissors ('S'): beats 'P', loses to 'R', draw with 'S'\n        Paper ('P'): beats 'R', loses to 'S', draw with 'P'\n\n    b. Alternatively, we can precompute a function that given two characters, returns whether the first wins, the second wins, or draw.\n\n    c. Then, we can create an array for one full cycle (of length T) of outcomes: for i from 0 to T-1, we get:\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        Then determine:\n            If a == b: then no red spot.\n            Else if (a, b) is one of the winning pairs: then the first player (Nikephoros) wins, so no red spot for him, but the loser (Polycarpus) gets one.\n            Else: Nikephoros loses, so he gets one red spot and Polycarpus doesn't.\n\n    d. Then, we can count for the full cycle:\n        Let total_rounds_cycle = T\n        Let win_cycle1 = number of rounds in the cycle where the outcome is that Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus loses) -> then Polycarpus gets a red spot for these rounds.\n        Let win_cycle2 = number of rounds in the cycle where the outcome is that Polycarpus wins (so Nikephoros loses) -> then Nikephoros gets a red spot for these rounds.\n\n        Note: There are also draws, which contribute nothing.\n\n    e. Then, the total red spots for Nikephoros = (number of full cycles) * win_cycle2 + (additional red spots in the remainder)\n    Similarly, for Polycarpus: (number of full cycles) * win_cycle1 + (additional red spots in the remainder)\n\n 9. How to compute the LCM? \n        T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n 10. But note: m and k are at most 1000, so the LCM is at most 1000*1000 (if they are coprime) which is 1e6. We can precompute the outcome for T rounds (each round being a pair (i % m, i % k)).\n\n 11. Steps:\n\n    Step 1: Read n, then string A, then string B.\n\n    Step 2: Compute T = LCM(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)\n\n    Step 3: Precompute the outcome for the first T rounds (each round i from 0 to T-1). But T can be 1e6, and we are only doing 1e6 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n    Step 4: Count for the full cycle (T rounds):\n        count_Nike_loss = 0   # This is the number of rounds in the cycle that result in Nikephoros losing (so he gets a red spot)\n        count_Poly_loss = 0   # This is the number of rounds in the cycle that result in Polycarpus losing (so he gets a red spot)\n\n        For i in range(T):\n            a_char = A[i % m]\n            b_char = B[i % k]\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue   # draw, no red spot for anyone\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                # Then Nikephoros wins: so Polycarpus loses -> count_Poly_loss += 1\n                count_Poly_loss += 1\n            elif (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                # Then Polycarpus wins: so Nikephoros loses -> count_Nike_loss += 1\n                count_Nike_loss += 1\n\n    Step 5: Let num_full_cycles = n // T\n    Step 6: Let rem = n % T\n\n    Step 7: Now, we need to simulate the remaining 'rem' rounds (from 0 to rem-1) to count additional red spots.\n\n        For i in range(rem):\n            a_char = A[i % m]\n            b_char = B[i % k]\n\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                pass\n            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses: add 1 to Polycarpus's red spots in the remainder?\n                # Actually, in our count above, we counted for the cycle: when Nikephoros wins, we increased count_Poly_loss.\n                # But in the remainder, we need to update the counts separately.\n                pass   # We can do the same condition and count for the remainder.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        total_Nike_red = num_full_cycles * count_Nike_loss\n        total_Poly_red = num_full_cycles * count_Poly_loss\n\n        Then for the remainder, we do:\n\n        for i in range(rem):\n            a_char = A[i % m]\n            b_char = B[i % k]\n\n            if a_char != b_char:\n                if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    # Nikephoros wins -> Polycarpus loses, so add 1 to total_Poly_red\n                    total_Poly_red += 1\n                else:\n                    # Polycarpus wins -> Nikephoros loses, so add 1 to total_Nike_red\n                    total_Nike_red += 1\n\n    However, note: the condition for Polycarpus wins is the reverse of the winning pairs. Alternatively, we can define a helper function.\n\n 12. But wait: what if we define a function that tells who wins?\n\n    We can define a function:\n\n        def outcome(a, b):\n            # returns -1 if a loses, 0 if draw, 1 if a wins.\n            if a == b:\n                return 0\n            elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                return 1   # a wins\n            else:\n                return -1   # a loses\n\n    Then, in the cycle and in the remainder:\n\n        if outcome(a, b) == 1:   # a wins -> then b loses: so Polycarpus (b) loses, so add to Polycarpus's red spots.\n            total_Poly_red += 1\n        elif outcome(a, b) == -1: # a loses -> then a (Nikephoros) loses, so add to Nikephoros's red spots.\n            total_Nike_red += 1\n\n 13. However, we already computed the cycle counts by the same rule. So we can use the same function.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can avoid writing a helper function and use the condition directly.\n\n 15. Let's code accordingly.\n\n 16. Important: We must compute the GCD for the LCM. We can use math.gcd.\n\n 17. Edge: n=0, but n>=1 per input.\n\n 18. Example: \n        Input: \"7\\nRPS\\nRSPP\"\n\n        We'll compute T = LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\n        Then we simulate 12 rounds? Actually, we are not going to simulate 12 rounds for the entire n=7 because 7 < 12. But wait, we are breaking into full cycles and remainder. However, note: the cycle is defined by the LCM of the two periods. But is it necessary to use LCM? \n\n        Actually, the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. So yes.\n\n        But in the example, n=7, m=3, k=4 -> T=12. Then num_full_cycles = 7//12 = 0, and rem=7.\n\n        Then we simulate the first 7 rounds (i from 0 to 6) and count the red spots.\n\n        How does the example go?\n\n        Round0: i=0 -> A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw.\n        Round1: i=1 -> A[1]='P', B[1]='S' -> P vs S: P beats S? No, according to the rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. \n                So: P vs S: P loses to S? Actually, no: the rule says: \n                - Rock beats Scissors -> so if a='P' and b='S': then a loses? Because P loses to S? Let me check: \n                The rules: \n                    Rock beats Scissors -> so if we have Paper and Scissors: \n                    Paper is beaten by Scissors? Actually, the rule: Scissors beats Paper. So yes, in this case, Polycarpus (with S) beats Nikephoros (with P). So Polycarpus wins -> so Nikephoros loses.\n\n        But wait, the example says: \n            R - R. Draw.\n            P - S. Nikephoros loses.\n\n        So indeed, in round1, the outcome is that Nikephoros loses.\n\n        Then our condition: \n            Condition for a win for a (Nikephoros): (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] \n            Here, a='P', b='S'. Is ('P','S') in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]? \n            No. Then we check the else: (b,a) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]: \n            (b,a) = ('S','P') -> is that in the list? Yes, because ('S','P') is there.\n\n        So our condition is correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define the win conditions for a as:\n            if a == 'R': then wins against 'S'\n            if a == 'S': then wins against 'P'\n            if a == 'P': then wins against 'R'\n\n        Then the condition for a win for a is: \n            (a, b) is one of: \n                ('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')\n\n        And the condition for a loss for a (win for b) is the reverse.\n\n 19. Implementation:\n\n    import math\n\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A_str = input().strip()\n    B_str = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A_str)\n    k = len(B_str)\n\n    # Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n\n    # If n is 0, then no rounds, but n>=1 so we don't worry.\n\n    # Precompute the cycle counts (for T rounds)\n    # But note: T might be 0? No, because m,k>=1.\n\n    # However, if n < T, then we don't need to simulate T rounds, but we can still use the cycle by simulating the entire T rounds and then use the remainder.\n\n    # But note: the cycle is the entire T rounds, so we can compute the counts for the cycle.\n\n    count_Nike_loss = 0   # In the cycle, the number of rounds that result in Nikephoros losing (so he gets a red spot)\n    count_Poly_loss = 0   # In the cycle, the number of rounds that result in Polycarpus losing (so he gets a red spot)\n\n    # We can simulate T rounds, but T might be 1e6 which is acceptable for a modern computer.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can try to compute without iterating T rounds by grouping by the modulus? \n    # But since m and k are small (<=1000) and T is at most 1e6, we can just iterate.\n\n    # But note: T = (m * k) // g, so worst-case m=k=1000, then T=1000000. That is acceptable.\n\n    # However, we can also note that the sequence of (i mod m, i mod k) is periodic with period T, and we are going to use each pair (a, b) exactly once? Not necessarily. \n    # Actually, the set of pairs (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to T-1 covers each residue class modulo the LCM? Actually, the pairs (x,y) such that x runs from 0 to m-1 and y runs from 0 to k-1? No, not exactly: the mapping i -> (i mod m, i mod k) is periodic with period T, and within one period, each pair (x,y) (where x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1]) appears exactly once? \n\n    # Actually, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the system of congruences:\n    #   i ≡ x (mod m)\n    #   i ≡ y (mod k)\n    # has a solution for any x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] if and only if x ≡ y (mod gcd(m,k))? \n    # But note: we are generating i from 0 to T-1, and T = LCM(m,k). The condition for the existence of i with i mod m = x and i mod k = y is that x ≡ y (mod g) where g = gcd(m,k). However, we are not requiring that. \n\n    # Actually, the standard result is that the set { (i mod m, i mod k) for i in [0, T-1] } is the entire set of pairs (x,y) such that x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] and x ≡ y (mod g). But note: our T is the LCM, and the set of residues (x,y) that appear are those with x mod g = y mod g. \n\n    # However, we don't care because we are just iterating over i from 0 to T-1.\n\n    # Let's do the iteration.\n\n    # But note: we can also compute the outcome for each pair (a, b) without knowing i, by knowing the indices. However, the sequences A and B are fixed, so we can precompute the entire grid for all x in range(m) and y in range(k) and then use the fact that the pair (x,y) appears exactly once in the cycle? \n\n    # Actually, the pair (x,y) appears exactly once in the cycle if and only if the system of congruences i ≡ x (mod m) and i ≡ y (mod k) has a solution modulo T. And that happens if and only if x ≡ y (mod g) (with g=gcd(m,k)). \n\n    # But we don't need to use the grid. We can simply iterate i from 0 to T-1.\n\n    # However, if we want to avoid the T iteration (because T might be large, but T<=1e6 is acceptable) then we do:\n\n    # But note: worst-case T=1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can compute the outcome for a fixed (x,y) without iterating over i. But we don't know which (x,y) pairs appear in the cycle. \n\n    # Let me stick to the iteration.\n\n    # But note: we have to do two iterations: one for the cycle (T rounds) and one for the remainder (which is at most T-1, so at most 1e6). So total iterations is T (for the cycle) plus n % T (which is less than T). But n % T is less than T, so worst-case we do 2*T, which is 2e6, acceptable.\n\n    # However, we can also avoid the cycle simulation by noticing that the entire game is periodic and the outcome for a round i is determined by (A[i%m], B[i%k]). But we have to account for the entire cycle.\n\n    # But let's do the straightforward way.\n\n    # We'll simulate the entire cycle (T rounds) to count the losses for each player in the cycle.\n\n    # However, note: T = LCM(m,k) and the cycle is defined by the two sequences. We are going to use:\n\n    #   for i in range(T):\n    #       a = A_str[i % m]\n    #       b = B_str[i % k]\n\n    #   and then check the outcome.\n\n    # But note: T can be 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can precompute the entire grid for all x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] and then use the fact that the cycle is the set of pairs (x,y) that satisfy x ≡ y (mod g). But then we would have to know which pairs appear. \n\n    # Since the problem constraints are small (m,k<=1000) and T<=1e6, we can do the iteration.\n\n    # Let's code the outcome condition without a helper function for clarity.\n\n    # We'll do:\n\n    #   for i in range(T):\n    #       a = A_str[i % m]\n    #       b = B_str[i % k]\n    #       if a == b:\n    #           continue\n    #       elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n    #           count_Poly_loss += 1\n    #       else:\n    #           count_Nike_loss += 1\n\n    # Then, we compute:\n\n    #   full_cycles = n // T\n    #   remainder = n % T\n\n    #   total_Nike_red = full_cycles * count_Nike_loss\n    #   total_Poly_red = full_cycles * count_Poly_loss\n\n    #   Then, for i in range(remainder):\n    #       a = A_str[i % m]\n    #       b = B_str[i % k]\n    #       if a == b:\n    #           continue\n    #       elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n    #           total_Poly_red += 1\n    #       else:\n    #           total_Nike_red += 1\n\n    # Then print(total_Nike_red, total_Poly_red)\n\n 20. Let's test with the example: n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n    m=3, k=4, T=12.\n\n    We simulate the first 7 rounds (since 7 < 12, so full_cycles=0, and remainder=7).\n\n    Round0: i=0 -> a='R', b='R' -> draw.\n    Round1: i=1 -> a='P', b='S' -> (P,S): not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so else: then Polycarpus wins -> count_Nike_loss += 1 (for the cycle, but we are in remainder now, so we add to total_Nike_red).\n        Actually, in the remainder simulation, we are not building the cycle counts for the entire cycle, we are building the cycle counts separately. But wait, in the example, the cycle counts are built from T=12 rounds, but we are only using the remainder. \n\n    However, note: the example does not use the full cycle. So we must rely on the remainder simulation.\n\n    But wait: the cycle counts (count_Nike_loss and count_Poly_loss) are built from the entire cycle of 12 rounds. Then we multiply by the number of full cycles (which is 0) and then add the remainder.\n\n    So we only simulate the remainder.\n\n    However, what if n=12? Then we use the cycle counts.\n\n    Let me compute the cycle counts for the entire 12 rounds (for the example):\n\n    We'll do i from 0 to 11:\n\n    i=0: (R,R) -> draw\n    i=1: (P,S) -> Polycarpus wins -> count_Nike_loss += 1\n    i=2: (S,P) -> (S,P): check: (S,P) is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> yes, because ('S','P') is there. So count_Poly_loss += 1\n    i=3: (R,P) -> (R,P): not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] (because 'R' beats 'S', but here 'P' is present and R loses to P) -> so Polycarpus wins -> count_Nike_loss += 1\n    i=4: (P,R) -> (P,R) is in the list -> count_Poly_loss += 1\n    i=5: (S,S) -> draw\n    i=6: (R,P) -> same as i=3 -> count_Nike_loss += 1\n    i=7: (P,S) -> same as i=1 -> count_Nike_loss += 1\n    i=8: (S,R) -> (S,R): check: (S,R) is not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> then check the reverse: (R,S) is in the list? (R,S) is in the list -> so Polycarpus wins? Wait, no: the condition for a win for a is (a,b) in the list. Here a='S', b='R'. (S,R) is not in the list. Then we check the reverse: (b,a) = (R,S) is in the list. So that means a (S) loses to b (R)? Actually, the condition for a loss is that (b,a) is in the list. So yes, Polycarpus wins -> count_Nike_loss += 1.\n        But wait: the rules: Rock beats Scissors. So if Polycarpus shows R and Nikephoros shows S, then Polycarpus wins -> so Nikephoros loses. Correct.\n\n    i=9: (R,S) -> (R,S) is in the list -> count_Poly_loss += 1\n    i=10: (P,P) -> draw\n    i=11: (S,P) -> same as i=2 -> count_Poly_loss += 1\n\n    Now, let's count:\n\n        count_Nike_loss (from cycle): \n            i=1,3,6,7,8 -> 5 times\n        count_Poly_loss (from cycle):\n            i=2,4,9,11 -> and i=2: yes, i=4: yes, i=9: yes, i=11: yes -> 4 times\n\n    Then, if n=12, then total_Nike_red = 5, total_Poly_red = 4.\n\n    But the example says for n=7: \n        Round0: draw\n        Round1: Nikephoros loses (so count_Nike_red=1)\n        Round2: Polycarpus loses (so count_Poly_red=1)\n        Round3: Nikephoros loses (count_Nike_red=2)\n        Round4: Polycarpus loses (count_Poly_red=2)\n        Round5: draw\n        Round6: Nikephoros loses (count_Nike_red=3)\n        Round7: Polycarpus loses (count_Poly_red=3) -> wait, the example output is \"3 2\".\n\n    Let me recount the example:\n\n        Input: 7 rounds, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        Round0: i=0 -> A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw. \n        Round1: i=1 -> A[1]='P', B[1]='S' -> P vs S: P loses to S -> Nikephoros loses (count_Nike_red=1)\n        Round2: i=2 -> A[2]='S', B[2]='P' -> S vs P: S loses to P? No, the rule: Scissors beats Paper -> so S wins, so Polycarpus loses (count_Poly_red=1)\n        Round3: i=3 -> A[0]='R', B[3]='P' -> R vs P: R loses to P -> Nikephoros loses (count_Nike_red=2)\n        Round4: i=4 -> A[1]='P', B[0]='R' -> P vs R: P loses to R? No, the rule: Paper beats Rock -> so P wins, so Polycarpus loses (count_Poly_red=2)\n        Round5: i=5 -> A[2]='S', B[1]='S' -> draw.\n        Round6: i=6 -> A[0]='R', B[2]='P' -> same as round3: R vs P -> Nikephoros loses (count_Nike_red=3)\n        Round7: i=7 -> A[1]='P', B[3]='P' -> P vs P: draw.\n\n        Wait, the example says: \n            ... and then R - P (round6) and then S - S (draw) and then R - P (round7) -> but wait, the example says:\n\n            \"Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\"\n\n        But according to my recount, after 7 rounds: \n            Nikephoros: 3 losses, Polycarpus: 2 losses.\n\n        Why did I get 3 for Polycarpus? \n\n        Let me check the example's own description:\n\n            R - R. Draw. \n            P - S. Nikephoros loses. \n            S - P. Polycarpus loses. \n            R - P. Nikephoros loses. \n            P - R. Polycarpus loses. \n            S - S. Draw. \n            R - P. Nikephoros loses.\n\n        So indeed: \n            Round0: draw.\n            Round1: Nikephoros loses (1)\n            Round2: Polycarpus loses (1)\n            Round3: Nikephoros loses (2)\n            Round4: Polycarpus loses (2)\n            Round5: draw.\n            Round6: Nikephoros loses (3)\n\n        So the example output is \"3 2\".\n\n        Now, why in my cycle simulation for i=4 (the fourth round, index4) I said: \n            i=4: (P,R) -> (P,R) is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> yes, so Polycarpus loses. \n        But in the example, round4 is the fifth round (index4) and indeed they say Polycarpus loses.\n\n        Then in the remainder simulation for n=7, we are only doing 7 rounds (i=0 to 6). \n\n        Let me simulate the 7 rounds (i from 0 to 6) without the cycle:\n\n        i0: (R,R) -> draw.\n        i1: (P,S) -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so else: Polycarpus wins -> add to Nikephoros: 1\n        i2: (S,P) -> ('S','P') is in the list -> Polycarpus loses -> add to Polycarpus: 1\n        i3: (R,P) -> (R,P): not in the list -> Polycarpus wins -> add to Nikephoros: 2\n        i4: (P,R) -> (P,R) is in the list -> Polycarpus loses -> add to Polycarpus: 2\n        i5: (S,S) -> draw.\n        i6: (R,P) -> same as i3 -> Polycarpus wins -> add to Nikephoros: 3\n\n        So total_Nike_red=3, total_Poly_red=2.\n\n        Therefore, the code for the remainder simulation must be:\n\n            for i in range(remainder):\n                a = A_str[i % m]\n                b = B_str[i % k]\n                if a == b:\n                    continue\n                elif (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    total_Poly_red += 1\n                else:\n                    total_Nike_red += 1\n\n        And for the cycle counts, we did the same condition.\n\n 21. Code accordingly.\n\n 22. One more example from the sample input: \n        ['5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'] -> Output: '0 0'\n\n        n=5, A=\"RRRRRRRR\", B=\"R\"\n\n        m=8, k=1, T = LCM(8,1)=8.\n\n        Cycle counts for T=8:\n\n        i0: (R,R) -> draw\n        i1: (R,R) -> draw\n        ... all draws.\n\n        So cycle counts: count_Nike_loss=0, count_Poly_loss=0.\n\n        Then full_cycles = 5 // 8 = 0, remainder=5.\n\n        Then we simulate 5 rounds (all R vs R): draws. So no red spots.\n\n        Output: 0 0.\n\n 23. Code implementation:\n\n    import math\n\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Compute T = LCM(m, k)\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n\n    # If T is 0, but m,k>=1 so T>=1.\n\n    # Count for the entire cycle (T rounds)\n    count_Nike_loss_cycle = 0\n    count_Poly_loss_cycle = 0\n\n    # Simulate the cycle (T rounds)\n    for i in range(T):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            count_Poly_loss_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            count_Nike_loss_cycle += 1\n\n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n\n    # Initialize the total red spots\n    nike_red = full_cycles * count_Nike_loss_cycle\n    poly_red = full_cycles * count_Poly_loss_cycle\n\n    # Now, simulate the remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            poly_red += 1\n        else:\n            nike_red += 1\n\n    print(f\"{nike_red} {poly_red}\")\n\n 24. However, note: the cycle counts and the remainder simulation use the same condition, so it's consistent.\n\n 25. Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n    Example1: n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\" -> Output: 3 2 -> correct.\n\n    Example2: n=5, A=\"RRRRRRRR\", B=\"R\" -> Output: 0 0 -> correct.\n\n 26. But wait, the example input was given as:\n\n        ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n    So the program reads:\n\n        First line: 7\n        Second line: \"RPS\"\n        Third line: \"RSPP\"\n\n        Then next test case: \n            First line: 5\n            Second line: \"RRRRRRRR\"\n            Third line: \"R\"\n\n    But the problem says: \n        The first line contains integer n.\n        The second line contains sequence A as a string.\n        The third line contains sequence B as a string.\n\n    So we read two test cases? Actually, the problem states one game. But the example input is given as two separate examples. \n\n    However, the problem says: \n        The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n    And the example input is:\n\n        ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n    This is two different inputs.\n\n    Our code reads one test case. So if we are given two test cases, we need to adjust.\n\n    But the problem statement says: \n        The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.\n\n    Then two lines for the sequences.\n\n    So the input is one test case.\n\n    However, the example input is provided as two separate examples. \n\n    In competitive programming, the input is usually one test case. But the example input is given as two examples in the problem statement.\n\n    Since the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input format is described, we assume one test case.\n\n    But if the judge provides multiple test cases, we would need to handle that. However, the problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n    Looking at the problem statement, it says:\n\n        Input\n        The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.\n        The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters.\n\n    So one test case.\n\n    Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n 27. However, the example input in the problem is given as two examples. But the problem says:\n\n        Example\n        Input\n        ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        Output\n        ['3 2', '0 0']\n\n    But note: the example input is two separate inputs. Our program must handle one input.\n\n    Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we read one test case.\n\n    But wait, the example input is provided as two strings in a list. In the actual input, the user will provide one set of inputs.\n\n    The example input format is:\n\n        First test case:\n            7\n            RPS\n            RSPP\n\n        Second test",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use predefined sequences of moves in a cyclic manner, and each round's outcome depends on the current move from each sequence. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results for up to 2 billion rounds without simulating each round individually, which would be computationally infeasible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players using cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome is determined by comparing the current move from each player's sequence. The goal is to count how many times each player loses over `n` rounds.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `LCM(m, k)` rounds, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of the sequences. This periodicity allows us to simulate one full cycle of rounds and then use multiplication to handle multiple cycles, followed by processing any remaining rounds.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths to determine the cycle length.\n   - **Cycle Simulation**: Simulate all rounds in one cycle to count losses for both players.\n   - **Multiplication for Full Cycles**: Multiply the cycle counts by the number of full cycles in `n` rounds.\n   - **Remainder Handling**: Simulate any remaining rounds after processing full cycles.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences. The simulation of one cycle takes O(m*k) time, which is feasible since `m` and `k` are at most 1000.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n    \n    count_Nike_loss_cycle = 0\n    count_Poly_loss_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            count_Poly_loss_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            count_Nike_loss_cycle += 1\n            \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    nike_red = full_cycles * count_Nike_loss_cycle\n    poly_red = full_cycles * count_Poly_loss_cycle\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            poly_red += 1\n        else:\n            nike_red += 1\n            \n    print(f\"{nike_red} {poly_red}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the sequence lengths `m` and `k` determines the cycle length `T`.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in the cycle, the code checks the outcome based on the current moves from sequences `A` and `B`. It counts how many times each player loses within the cycle.\n4. **Full Cycles Handling**: The total losses from full cycles are computed by multiplying the cycle counts by the number of full cycles (`n // T`).\n5. **Remainder Rounds**: Any remaining rounds after processing full cycles are simulated individually to update the loss counts.\n6. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance without excessive computation.",
