При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string `t` and we need to check if it can be formed by taking two copies of some string `s` (with the same length) and then overlapping them (with a positive overlap, i.e., at least one character and less than the entire string).\n\n Conditions:\n 1. The entire string `t` must be the concatenation of two copies of `s` that have been overlapped.\n 2. The overlap is such that the suffix of the first copy of `s` matches the prefix of the second copy of `s`.\n 3. The length of the overlap is at least 1 and less than the length of `s`.\n 4. Additionally, note that the entire message must be exactly the result of two identical messages `s` being sent and then possibly overlapped.\n\n Observation:\n Let n = len(t). If we assume that the original string was s (of length m), then we must have sent two copies of s. The total length of the transmission without error would be 2*m, but with an overlap of k (where 0 < k < m) we get a resulting string of length 2*m - k.\n\n Therefore: 2*m - k = n, and k must be between 1 and m-1.\n\n Also, the string t must be equal to:\n   t = s + s[k:]   OR we can think of it as: \n   Let s = x + y, where x is the non-overlapping part and y is the overlapping part (so |x|+|y|=m, and the overlap k = |y|).\n   Then t = x + y + y? Actually, wait: the first message is s, then the second message starts and we overlap by k. So the second message is s again, and we take the first (m-k) characters of s (if we consider the first message is s and the second is s, then the overlap is the last k characters of the first s and the first k of the second s must match).\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: \n   Let the entire string t be split into two parts: the first part is the entire first s, and then the second part is the remaining part which is the rest of the second s (without the first k characters). But note: the second s might not be entirely present.\n\n Actually, the problem says: two identical messages s are sent. Then the received message is the first s and then the second s but starting from the k-th character (so the first k characters of the second s are merged with the last k of the first s).\n\n However, note: the example: \n   Input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' -> s = 'abrakadabra', then the second s starts and we see that the first 5 letters of the second s are already provided by the overlap? Actually, the example output is 'YES\\nabrakadabra'\n\n But note: the example also has: 'acacacaca' -> YES, and the example input also includes 'acacacaca' in the list.\n\n Let me break down:\n\n Example 1: t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n   Without error: we have two copies of \"abrakadabra\", so if there's no error we have \"abrakadabraabrakadabra\" (length 20). With error, we have overlapped by 5? Then the total length is 20 - 5 = 15, which matches.\n\n   How does the overlap work?\n     First s: \"abrakadabra\"\n     Second s: \"abrakadabra\"\n     Overlap: 5 -> so the second s is broken into: first 5 characters are \"abrac\", but wait, actually the overlap is the last k of the first s and the first k of the second s must match.\n\n   In the example, the first s is \"abrakadabra\", and then the next part is \"brakadabra\", so the overlap is 5 because the last 5 of the first s are \"abra\" and the next character? Actually, let's compare:\n\n   First s: \"abrakadabra\"\n   Then the next part should be the second s without the first k characters. But wait, the example output is 15, so the entire string is 15.\n\n   Actually, the example says: \n        \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" or \"abrakadabrakadabra\"\n\n   In the first example: \n        s = \"abrakadabra\" (11 letters)\n        Then the second s is sent, but the last 1 letter of the first s is 'a' and the first 1 letter of the second s is 'a' -> so they merge and we get \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" (without the first 'a')? \n\n   Actually, let me write:\n\n        First s: \"abrakadabra\"\n        Second s: \"abrakadabra\", but we start from the second character? Then we get \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n   That is 11 + 10 = 21? That doesn't match.\n\n   Let me recount: \n        Original s: \"abrakadabra\" has 11 characters.\n        Without error: two copies would be 22 characters. But the example string is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" which is 21 characters.\n\n   So the overlap is 1 character? Then the second message starts at the next character after the first one.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: the received string t is built by:\n        t = s + s[overlap:]\n\n   But wait, the example says: \n        t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n   How did they get that?\n\n        s = \"abrakadabra\"\n        Overlap: k=1 -> then the second s is appended from index 1: \n            s + s[1:] -> \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 11 + 10 = 21.\n\n   So the condition is: t = s + s[k:], but note that k must be the length of the overlap (which is the same as the length of s[0:k] that was overlapped). However, note that the entire second s is not appended, only the part after the overlap.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: two identical messages. So the second message is s. Then the transmission is: the entire first s and then the second s without the first k characters (because the last k of the first s and the first k of the second s are merged).\n\n   Therefore, the total length is len(s) + (len(s) - k) = 2*len(s) - k.\n\n   And we know the total length is n.\n\n   So: n = 2*m - k, where m = len(s). Then k = 2*m - n.\n\n   Conditions on k: \n        k must be an integer between 1 and m-1 (both inclusive).\n\n   Now, how do we relate t and s?\n\n   We have two possibilities for the entire string t:\n\n   Possibility 1: The string t is built from two copies of s with an overlap of k.\n\n   Then t must satisfy:\n        t = s + s[k:]\n\n   Also, the condition for the overlap: the last k characters of s must equal the first k characters of s.\n\n   But wait, that is automatically satisfied because s[k:] is the substring from index k to the end, and the first k characters of s are s[0:k]. However, the entire string t is built by s (the first copy) and then the second copy without the first k characters, so the second copy without the first k is just s[k:]. \n\n   But note: the condition for the error is that the two messages were identical and the overlap happened. So the last k characters of the first message must equal the first k of the second. Since both are s, we require that s[0:k] == s[m-k:m] (but note: the first message ends with s[-k:], and the second message starts with s[0:k]). \n\n   However, we don't know k until we know m. But note: we have k = 2*m - n.\n\n   Also, the entire string t must be of length n = 2*m - k, and we know k = 2*m - n.\n\n   Now, how to find s?\n\n   We know that the entire string t is: \n        t[0:m] = s\n        t[m:] = s[k:]   (because the second part is the second s without the first k characters)\n\n   Therefore, the entire string t must be:\n        t = s + s[k:]\n\n   And we know k = 2*m - n.\n\n   Also, we must have that the last k characters of s (i.e., s[m-k:m]) must equal the first k characters of s (i.e., s[0:k]), because the first message ends with the last k characters and the second message starts with the first k, and they must match.\n\n   However, note: the second part of t is s[k:], so the second part of t is the entire s without the first k characters. \n\n   But wait, we can also consider: the entire string t must be periodic with period m, but with an overlap of k, so the condition is that the suffix of t of length k must equal the prefix of t of length k, and more specifically, the way we break t is:\n\n        Let m = (n+k)//2, but we have k = 2*m - n, so m = (n+k)/2 -> but k = 2*m-n, so m = (n + 2*m - n)/2 = (2*m)/2 = m, which is consistent.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate over possible k (or m) such that k is an integer and satisfies 1<=k<=m-1 and n=2*m-k.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Let n = len(t)\n   2. We need to find an integer m (the length of s) and k (the overlap) such that:\n        n = 2*m - k, and 1 <= k < m.\n\n      Then m must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) and at most n-1 (because k>=1 -> 2*m-n>=1 -> m>=(n+1)/2; and k<m -> 2*m-n < m -> m<n).\n\n   3. For each m from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1 (inclusive) [since k = 2*m - n must be positive and less than m, so m must be in this range]:\n        k = 2*m - n\n        Then we require that k is an integer (which it is) and 0 < k < m (which we enforce by our m range).\n\n   4. Then we can define s as the first m characters of t? Not necessarily. Because the entire string t is built by two copies of s with an overlap. But note:\n\n        t[0:m] = s\n        t[m:] = s[k:]   (and the length of t[m:] is n - m = (2*m - k) - m = m - k)\n\n        Also, the condition for the error is that the last k of s (which is s[m-k:m]) must equal the first k of s (which is s[0:k]).\n\n        But note: the entire string t must be: \n            t = s + s[k:]\n\n        However, we don't know s. But note: the first m characters of t must be s. Then the next part is from s[k:]. But s[k:] is the second part of s (starting at index k). \n\n        Therefore, the entire string t must satisfy:\n\n            t[0:m] = s\n            t[m:] = s[k:]\n\n        And we also have the condition that the first k of s must equal the last k of s.\n\n   5. However, we don't know s, but we can recover s from t? Actually, we can try:\n\n        Condition 1: The first m characters of t is s.\n        Condition 2: The substring of t from index m to the end (which is of length n-m) must equal the substring of s from index k to the end (which is of length m-k).\n\n        So: t[m:] == s[k:]   => t[m:] == t[k:m]\n\n        Additionally, we must have that the last k of s (which is t[m-k:m]) equals the first k of s (which is t[0:k]).\n\n        But note: s = t[0:m], so the last k of s is t[m-k:m] and the first k is t[0:k]. So we require t[0:k] == t[m-k:m].\n\n   6. Therefore, for a given m (and hence k=2*m-n) we can check:\n        (a) k is an integer and 0<k<m (which we already have by the range of m).\n        (b) t[0:k] == t[m-k:m]   [this is the condition for the overlap]\n        (c) Additionally, the second part of t (from index m to the end) must be equal to s[k:] (which is t[k:m]). But note: the length of the second part is n-m = m-k, and the length of s[k:] is m-k, so they have the same length. And we require t[m:] == t[k:m].\n\n        However, note: the entire string t is built by s (first m) and then the second part is s[k:]. So we require t[m:] == t[k:m].\n\n   7. But wait, if we have two conditions:\n        Condition A: t[0:k] == t[m-k:m]   (overlap condition)\n        Condition B: t[m:] == t[k:m]        (the rest of the string must be the tail of s)\n\n   However, note that t[k:m] is the part of s from index k to the end. And the second part of t is from index m to the end. But we don't know s from t. Actually, we can use condition A to check the overlap, and condition B to check the tail.\n\n   But note: we don't know s, but we have s = t[0:m]. Then condition B is: t[m:] == t[k:m] (the tail of s). \n\n   However, we can check condition B independently: \n        t[m:] should be of length n-m = m-k, and t[k:m] is of length m-k, so we can compare.\n\n   But note: condition A is about the first k of s and the last k of s. And condition B is about the rest of s (from k to the end) and the next part of the string.\n\n   However, we can also note: the entire string t is built by s and then s[k:]. Then the entire string t must be:\n\n        t[0:m] = s\n        t[m:] = s[k:]\n\n        But s[k:] is the same as the substring from index k to the end of s.\n\n        Then the entire string t can be split as:\n\n          t[0:k]   -> the first k of s\n          t[k:m]   -> the rest of s (which is the second part of the first s, but wait, the first s is t[0:m] so that's correct)\n          t[m:]    -> the second s without the first k\n\n        Now, note that the second s is s, so the part t[m:] must be s[k:]. And s[k:] is t[k:m] (because s is the first m characters of t). \n\n        Therefore, condition B is automatically satisfied by the definition of s? \n\n        But wait, we don't know s, we are using s = t[0:m]. Then condition B is: t[m:] == t[k:m] (the tail of s). \n\n        However, we must ensure that the entire string t is consistent.\n\n   8. So algorithm:\n\n        Let n = len(t)\n        We'll iterate m from floor((n+1)/2) to n-1 (because m must be at least (n+1)//2 (ceiling) and less than n).\n\n        For each m:\n            k = 2*m - n   (must be positive and less than m)\n\n            Check if k is positive and k < m (we know from our range, but let's confirm: m>=ceil((n+1)/2) and m<n -> k=2*m-n, and since m>=ceil((n+1)/2) then 2*m>=n+1, so k>=1, and k=2*m-n < m -> 2*m-n < m -> m < n, which is true).\n\n            Then, we set s = t[0:m]\n\n            Condition 1: The overlap condition: the first k characters of s must equal the last k characters of s, i.e., t[0:k] == t[m-k:m]\n\n            Condition 2: The rest of the string must be the tail of s: t[m:] == t[k:m]\n\n            But note: Condition 2 is automatically implied by the fact that s is defined as t[0:m] and the second part is s[k:]. However, we must check that the second part (t[m:]) is exactly the tail of s (t[k:m]).\n\n        However, note: the entire string t is built by s (t[0:m]) and then s[k:] (which is t[k:m]). So the second part must be t[k:m]. Therefore, we require:\n\n            t[m:] == t[k:m]\n\n        But wait, what if the string t has more than m+k characters? Actually, the total length is n = m + (m-k) = 2*m - k, which we used.\n\n        So the conditions are:\n\n            (a) t[0:k] == t[m-k:m]\n            (b) t[m:] == t[k:m]\n\n        And note: the length of t[m:] is n-m = (2*m-k)-m = m-k, and the length of t[k:m] is m-k, so the lengths match.\n\n   9. Example: t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", n=21.\n\n        We need to find m such that k=2*m-21 is positive and less than m, and m from ceil(22/2)=11 to 20.\n\n        Let m=11: then k=2*11-21=1.\n\n        Condition (a): t[0:1]=='a', t[11-1:11] = t[10:11]=='a' -> yes.\n        Condition (b): t[11:] should be t[1:11] -> t[11:] is \"brakadabra\" (from index11 to the end, which is 10 characters) and t[1:11] is \"brakadabra\" (from index1 to 10, which is 10 characters). So condition (b) holds.\n\n        Then we can say s = t[0:11] = \"abrakadabra\", and the answer is YES.\n\n   10. Another example: t = \"acacacaca\", n=9.\n\n        We try m from ceil((9+1)/2)=5 to 8.\n\n        m=5: k=10-9=1 -> Condition (a): t[0:1]=='a', t[5-1:5]=t[4:5]=='a' -> ok.\n              Condition (b): t[5:] is \"cacaca\", and t[1:5] is \"cacac\" (from index1 to 4) -> \"cacac\" (5 characters) but t[5:] is 4 characters? Actually, n=9, m=5, so t[5:] is from index5 to the end: \"caca\" (4 characters). But t[1:5] is from index1 to 4: \"cacac\" (5 characters) -> not equal.\n\n        m=6: k=12-9=3 -> Condition (a): t[0:3]=='aca', t[6-3:6]=t[3:6]=='aca' -> ok.\n              Condition (b): t[6:] is \"caca\" (4 characters) and t[3:6] is \"caca\" (from index3 to 5: \"cac\") -> wait, t[3:6] is \"cac\", but t[6:] is \"caca\". They are different.\n\n        m=7: k=14-9=5 -> Condition (a): t[0:5]=='acaca', t[7-5:7]=t[2:7]=='caca' -> 'acaca' vs 'caca' (but wait, the last 5 of s (which is t[0:7]=\"acacaca\") is \"caca\" (from index2 to 6) -> \"caca\" (length5? Actually, from index2 to 7 is 5 characters: \"caca\" (but wait, t[2:7] is \"caca\" only 4 characters? Actually, t[2:7] is 5 characters: indices2,3,4,5,6 -> 'c','a','c','a','c'? Let me count: \n            t = \"acacacaca\"\n            indices: \n                0: 'a'\n                1: 'c'\n                2: 'a'\n                3: 'c'\n                4: 'a'\n                5: 'c'\n                6: 'a'\n                7: 'c'\n                8: 'a'\n            So t[2:7] is from index2 to index6 (inclusive) -> 'a','c','a','c','a' -> \"acaca\"\n\n            Then Condition (a): t[0:5] is \"acaca\", and t[7-5:7]=t[2:7] is \"acaca\" -> matches.\n\n            Condition (b): t[7:] is \"ca\" (2 characters), and t[5:7] is \"ca\" (from index5 to 6) -> matches.\n\n            So we found m=7, k=5, s = t[0:7] = \"acacaca\".\n\n        But wait, the example output says: \n            Input: 'acacacaca' -> Output: 'YES\\nacaca'\n\n        Why did they output 'acaca'? \n\n        Note: the problem says: if there are multiple answers, output any. \n\n        However, note that the example output is 'acaca'. But we found that s=\"acacaca\" (length7) works. \n\n        But wait, the example input also says: \n            ['acacacaca'] -> 'YES\\nacaca'\n\n        So they are outputting a string of length5, not 7.\n\n        Let me check: \n            If s = \"acaca\", then without error the string would be \"acacacaca\" (length10). But the received string is \"acacacaca\" (length9). \n\n            Then the overlap k would be 2*5-9=1. Then the entire string is s + s[1:] = \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is 5+4=9. \n\n            Now, check conditions for m=5 (which we tried above and condition (b) failed) but wait, above we tried m=5 and condition (b) failed because we compared t[5:] and t[1:5] and they didn't match. \n\n            But now, if s=\"acaca\", then the first part is t[0:5]=\"acaca\", and the second part is s[1:]==\"caca\", so the entire string is \"acaca\"+\"caca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is correct.\n\n            However, note: the condition for the overlap is that the last k (1) of s must equal the first k (1) of s. \n                s[0:1]=='a'\n                s[5-1:5]==s[4:5]=='a' -> condition (a) holds.\n\n            Condition (b): t[5:] should be s[1:5] = \"caca\", and t[5:] is \"caca\" (from index5 to 8: 'c','a','c','a') -> matches.\n\n            So why did I get confused earlier? \n\n            When m=5, we set s=t[0:5]=\"acaca\", then condition (b) is: t[5:]==\"caca\" and s[1:5]==\"caca\", so they are equal.\n\n            What did I do wrong in my first calculation for m=5?\n                Condition (b): t[5:] is \"cacaca\" without the first 5? Actually, wait, t is \"acacacaca\" (9 characters). \n                    t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n                    t[5:] = t[5:9] = \"caca\"\n\n                And s[1:5] = \"acaca\"[1:5] = \"cacac\" (from index1 to 4) -> but wait, that's 4 characters? \n\n            Correction: s[1:5] is from index1 to index4 (exclusive of index5) -> 4 characters: \n                s = \"acaca\": \n                    index0: 'a'\n                    index1: 'c'\n                    index2: 'a'\n                    index3: 'c'\n                    index4: 'a'\n\n                So s[1:5] is from index1 to index4: \"c\",\"a\",\"c\",\"a\" -> \"caca\"\n\n            So condition (b) is satisfied.\n\n            Then why did I say \"t[1:5] is 'cacac'\"? That was a mistake: in Python, slicing [1:5] for a string of length5 gives the substring from index1 to index4 (4 characters).\n\n            Therefore, m=5 is valid.\n\n        But then why did the example output 'acaca' (which is s of length5) and not the other one (length7)? \n\n        The problem says: if there are multiple answers, output any.\n\n        However, note: we found two solutions: \n            s1 = \"acaca\" (length5) and s2 = \"acacaca\" (length7)\n\n        Both lead to the same string t? \n\n            With s1: \n                t = s1 + s1[1:] = \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\" (9 characters) -> matches.\n\n            With s2:\n                t = s2 + s2[5:] = \"acacaca\" + \"ca\" = \"acacacaca\" (9 characters) -> matches.\n\n        So both are valid.\n\n        The example output is 'acaca'. So we can output the shorter one.\n\n   11. Therefore, we can iterate m from the minimum value (ceil((n+1)/2)) to n-1, and check the conditions. We can break at the first m that satisfies the conditions and output s = t[0:m] (the first m characters).\n\n        However, note: the problem says: \n            \"Во втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca.\"\n\n        But the example output is 'acaca'. So they are outputting the shorter one.\n\n        But the problem says: \"if there are multiple answers, output any\".\n\n        We can choose the smallest m (i.e., the shortest s) that satisfies the conditions.\n\n        However, note: the example input also includes:\n\n            Input: 'abcabc' -> Output: 'NO'\n\n            Let's check with our method:\n\n            t = \"abcabc\", n=6.\n\n            m from ceil((6+1)/2)=ceil(3.5)=4 to 5.\n\n            m=4: k=8-6=2.\n                Condition (a): t[0:2]=='ab', t[4-2:4]=t[2:4]=='cb' -> 'ab' != 'cb'\n                Condition (b): t[4:]=='bc', t[2:4]=='cb' -> 'bc' != 'cb'\n\n            m=5: k=10-6=4.\n                Condition (a): t[0:4]=='abca', t[5-4:5]=t[1:5]=='bcab' -> 'abca' != 'bcab'\n                Condition (b): t[5:]=='bc', t[4:5]=='b' -> lengths: t[5:] is 1, t[4:5] is 1, but 'bc' vs 'b' -> wait, wait: \n\n                Actually, t[5:] is from index5 to the end: \"bc\" (if n=6, then t[5:] is the substring starting at index5, which is the 6th character? Actually, indexing from0: \n                    t = \"abcabc\"\n                    index0: 'a'\n                    index1: 'b'\n                    index2: 'c'\n                    index3: 'a'\n                    index4: 'b'\n                    index5: 'c'\n\n                So t[5:] is 'c'. \n                t[4:5] is from index4 to5 (exclusive) -> 'b'\n\n                So condition (b): 'c' != 'b'\n\n            Therefore, no solution, so output 'NO'.\n\n        This matches.\n\n   12. Another example: t='abababab', n=8.\n\n        The example output: 'YES\\nababab'\n\n        Let me check: \n            s = \"ababab\", m=6, then k=12-8=4.\n            Condition (a): t[0:4]=='abab', t[6-4:6]=t[2:6]=='abab' -> matches.\n            Condition (b): t[6:]=='ab', and t[4:6]=='ab' -> matches.\n\n        So s = \"ababab\" (length6) is valid.\n\n        But is there a shorter one?\n\n        We iterate from m_min = ceil((8+1)/2)=ceil(4.5)=5 to 7.\n\n        m=5: k=10-8=2.\n            Condition (a): t[0:2]=='ab', t[5-2:5]=t[3:5]=='ba' -> 'ab' != 'ba'\n            Condition (b): t[5:]=='ab', t[2:5]=='bab' -> 'ab' != 'bab'\n\n        m=6: valid.\n\n        So we output s of length6.\n\n        The example output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\n   13. Implementation:\n\n        Steps:\n            Read the string t.\n\n            n = len(t)\n\n            Let min_m = (n+1)//2   [ceiling of (n+1)/2] but note: if n is even, (n+1)//2 is (n+1)/2 rounded up. However, we want the smallest integer m such that 2*m>n+1? Actually, we want m >= ceil((n+1)/2). \n\n            Alternatively, we can set:\n                min_m = (n+1)//2   # This is the ceiling of (n+1)/2 for integer n? \n                Example: n=9 -> (9+1)//2 = 10//2=5 -> correct.\n                         n=8 -> (8+1)//2=9//2=4 (in integer floor division) -> but we want 5? \n\n            Actually, we want m such that 2*m > n (so that k=2*m-n>=1). The smallest m is floor((n+1)/2)+1? \n\n            Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n                We require: 2*m > n and m < n.\n\n                So m_min = floor((n+1)/2) + 1? \n\n            Actually, let me derive:\n\n                k = 2*m - n >= 1  => m >= ceil((n+1)/2)\n\n            But in Python, ceil((n+1)/2) can be computed as (n+1)//2 if n is odd? \n\n            Example: \n                n=9: ceil((9+1)/2)=ceil(10/2)=5 -> (9+1)//2=5.\n                n=8: ceil((8+1)/2)=ceil(9/2)=ceil(4.5)=5 -> (8+1)//2=9//2=4 (using integer floor division) -> so we cannot use (n+1)//2 for ceiling.\n\n            Instead, we can use:\n\n                min_m = (n+1)//2 + (1 if (n+1)%2!=0 else 0)   -> no, better to use:\n\n                We require 2*m >= n+1, so m >= (n+1)/2.\n\n                Since m is integer, min_m = ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1+1)//2 if we use integer ceiling? \n\n            Actually, we can use: \n                min_m = (n+1) // 2 + 1   if (n+1) % 2 != 0 then we need to round up, but wait:\n\n                Alternatively, we can iterate m from (n+1)//2 + 1 to n-1? \n\n            But wait, let me reexamine:\n\n                k = 2*m - n >= 1  => m >= (n+1)/2.\n\n                So the smallest integer m is floor((n+1)/2) + 1? \n\n            Example n=9: (9+1)/2=5, so m_min=5 -> then we start at 5.\n            Example n=8: (8+1)/2=4.5 -> then m_min=5.\n\n            So we can set:\n                m_min = (n+1) // 2 + (1 if (n+1) % 2 != 0 else 0)   -> but wait, (n+1)//2 is floor division.\n\n            Actually, we can use: \n                m_min = (n+1) // 2 + 1   if we want the smallest integer >= (n+1)/2, but wait: \n\n                If n is odd, say n=2k-1, then (n+1)/2 = k, so m_min=k.\n                If n is even, say n=2k, then (n+1)/2 = k+0.5, so ceil is k+1.\n\n            We can compute m_min as: \n                m_min = (n+1) // 2   # This gives floor((n+1)/2)\n                Then if n is even, floor((n+1)/2) = (n+1)//2 = (2k+1)//2 = k (if n=2k, then (2k+1)//2=k in floor division) -> but we need k+1.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                m_min = (n+1) // 2 + 1   # for both even and odd? \n\n            Let me test:\n\n                n=9 (odd): (9+1)//2=5, then 5+1=6 -> but we want to start at 5, not 6.\n\n            So that doesn't work.\n\n            Actually, we want m_min = ceil((n+1)/2).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap of some positive length. The overlap must be such that the last `k` characters of the first `s` match the first `k` characters of the second `s`, where `1 ≤ k < len(s)`. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be constructed by taking the first `s` and appending the second `s` starting from the `k`-th character (where `k` is the overlap length). The total length of `t` is `2 * len(s) - k`.\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `m` of `s`, we calculate the overlap length `k = 2*m - len(t)`. We then check if `k` is a positive integer less than `m`. If so, we verify two conditions:\n   - The first `k` characters of `s` (taken as the first `m` characters of `t`) must match the last `k` characters of `s`.\n   - The remaining part of `t` (after the first `m` characters) must match the substring of `s` starting from the `k`-th character.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over all possible lengths `m` from `(len(t) + 2) // 2` to `len(t) - 1`. For each `m`, compute `k` and check the conditions mentioned above. If any `m` satisfies both conditions, `s` is the first `m` characters of `t`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks each possible `m` in linear time relative to the length of `t`, making it efficient for the given constraints (string length ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    m_min = (n + 2) // 2\n    found = False\n    \n    for m in range(m_min, n):\n        k = 2 * m - n\n        if k <= 0 or k >= m:\n            continue\n            \n        s = t[:m]\n        if t[:k] != t[m - k:m]:\n            continue\n            \n        if t[m:] == s[k:]:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(t[:m])\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string is empty, the output is \"NO\".\n3. **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: The loop starts from the minimum possible length `m_min` (calculated as `(n + 2) // 2`) to `n - 1`.\n4. **Overlap Calculation**: For each `m`, the overlap length `k` is calculated as `2 * m - n`. If `k` is not positive or not less than `m`, the loop continues.\n5. **Condition Checks**: The first `k` characters of `s` (first `m` characters of `t`) must match the last `k` characters of `s`. Additionally, the remaining part of `t` (after the first `m` characters) must match the substring of `s` starting from the `k`-th character.\n6. **Output Result**: If any `m` satisfies both conditions, \"YES\" and the corresponding `s` are printed. Otherwise, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could have been formed by overlapping two identical strings `s`, ensuring correctness while adhering to the problem constraints.",
