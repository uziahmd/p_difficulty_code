His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, then two lists of n integers: a (first tour) and b (second tour).\n\n We know that Vasya has at least x points in total. But note: the problem says the teacher has the results (without names) for both tours, and Vasya was present. However, we don't know which participant is Vasya. But we know that there exists one pair (i, j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n The idea:\n We are to find the best and worst place Vasya could have gotten.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Since the participants are sorted by the sum of the two tours (and if same sum, jury can assign arbitrarily), we need to consider all participants and their possible sums.\n\n 2. However, note: we don't know which two numbers (one from a and one from b) belong to Vasya. But we know that Vasya's total is at least x. So we must consider that Vasya could have any pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i+b_j>=x, but actually the problem says the two numbers are from the two lists (so one from the first list and one from the second). \n\n 3. But note: the input gives two lists of n integers. Each participant has one score from the first list and one from the second. So the total set of participants is the set of pairs (a_i, b_j) for i,j from 0 to n-1? Actually, no: each participant is one element from the first list and one from the second, but the two lists are given independently and we don't know which ones are paired.\n\n 4. However, the problem states: \"the participants' points are given in the arbitrary order\" for both tours.\n\n 5. How to approach?\n\n Let's think:\n\n We have two arrays: a (size n) and b (size n). The actual participants are the n pairs (a_i, b_i)? Or is it that we have two separate lists and we can reassign arbitrarily? Actually, note: the problem says \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", meaning that the two lists are of size n and there are n participants. But the pairing is arbitrary? \n\n Actually, wait: the problem says \"the results have only points, no names\". And the input gives two lines: first line the first tour points (n integers) and second line the second tour points (n integers). The participants are the same n, so the pairing is fixed? \n\n Let me read the problem again: \"The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names.\" \n\n And note: \"It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\"\n\n This means that the two lists are the scores of the same n participants, but without knowing which score is from which participant. However, the pairing is not necessarily the same index as in the input.\n\n But note: the problem does not say that the participant who got a_i in the first tour must have gotten b_i in the second. So we can reassign the second list arbitrarily to the first? Actually, the problem says the results have no names, so we don't know the pairing.\n\n However, we know that Vasya's total is at least x. So Vasya must be one of the pairs (a_i, b_j) for some i and j (but note: the two lists are the same n participants, so we cannot use an element from a twice or from b twice). \n\n But wait: the problem says \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such that ai + bj ≥ x\". So we are allowed to assume that Vasya is represented by a_i from the first list and b_j from the second list, and they are independent.\n\n However, the catch: the entire set of participants is the set of n pairs (each participant is uniquely identified by being in the first list and the second list). But the two lists are given separately, so the pairing is arbitrary. \n\n Therefore, we are allowed to assign the second list arbitrarily to the first list? Actually, no: the problem says that the teacher has the two lists (so the first list has the first tour scores, the second list the second tour scores) and each participant has one score from the first and one from the second. But the assignment is arbitrary. \n\n This is key: we are allowed to consider any bijection between the two lists? Actually, no: the problem doesn't say that. It says the results are without names, so we don't know the pairing. But the two lists are fixed: the first list is the first tour, the second list is the second tour, and each participant has one entry in each. So the pairing is fixed by the fact that there are n participants, so we have to assign each first tour score to one second tour score. However, the problem does not specify how the pairing is done. \n\n But note: the problem does not require us to know the exact pairing. We are to consider the best and worst place Vasya could have. \n\n We can consider: what are the possible total scores for Vasya? He can be any pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x? Actually, no: because the two lists are from the same n participants, we cannot assign the same element of the second list to two different first list elements. But wait, we are considering Vasya's own pair. For the purpose of determining Vasya's total, we are told that there is at least one pair (a_i, b_j) (with i and j being indices from 1 to n) such that a_i+b_j>=x. However, the problem does not specify that the other participants' scores are fixed. Actually, the entire set of participants is fixed: we have two lists of n scores. \n\n However, note: the problem does not say that the pairing is fixed. We are free to assign the second list to the first list arbitrarily? Actually, we are not free to reassign arbitrarily because the two lists are given and each participant is defined by one first and one second score. But the problem says \"no names\", meaning we don't know which first score goes with which second score. \n\n Important: The total set of participants is fixed, but the pairing is arbitrary. That means: we can form the n pairs arbitrarily (as long as each element of the first list is used exactly once and each element of the second list is used exactly once). \n\n Then, the problem becomes:\n\n We have two multisets: A (first list) and B (second list). We want to assign each element of A to an element of B (bijection) to form n pairs (a_i, b_j). Then, Vasya is one of these pairs (but we don't know which one) and we know that his total is at least x.\n\n Now, we are to compute the best and worst rank Vasya can get.\n\n How to compute the best and worst rank?\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are allowed to choose which pair is Vasya's (as long as the total is at least x) and also we can choose the entire pairing arbitrarily (except that Vasya must have at least x). However, note: the problem states that Vasya was present, so we must have at least one pair (from the entire set of pairs) that has total >=x. But actually, we are given two lists and we are to consider the entire set of participants (all n pairs). \n\n But wait: the problem says \"Vasya got at least x points for both tours\", so we know that there is at least one pair (from the entire set of pairs) that has total >=x. However, the pairing is arbitrary, so we can choose the pairing arbitrarily (as long as the multiset of the first list and the multiset of the second list are fixed). \n\n However, note: the problem does not require us to fix the other participants. We are allowed to choose the pairing arbitrarily, so we can choose the best and worst scenario for Vasya.\n\n Approach:\n\n We are going to consider:\n\n - Best place: We want to maximize Vasya's total (if possible) so that he can be placed as high as possible. Alternatively, we can arrange the other participants to have as low totals as possible, and then place Vasya above them.\n\n But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily the second list to the first list.\n\n Steps for best place:\n\n  - We want to assign the second list to the first list to form pairs (a_i, b_j) such that one of the pairs has total at least x (this is given). To get the best rank, we would like to have as few participants as possible with total greater than or equal to Vasya's total (or even better, we can assign so that Vasya has the highest total).\n\n However, note: we are not forced to use a particular assignment for the entire set. We can assign arbitrarily, but we must use all the numbers.\n\n We can do:\n\n  Step 1: Consider the entire set of pairs. The total number of pairs is n. The ranking is by the sum (and if ties, the jury decides arbitrarily). \n\n  Step 2: To get the best place for Vasya, we can try to maximize his total. But note: we are constrained by the two multisets. We have to assign the entire second list to the first list.\n\n  Alternatively, we can think:\n\n  What is the maximum total that Vasya can achieve? That is the maximum value of a_i + b_j (over i and j) that we can form under the constraint that we are using the entire set of numbers (so we must assign all the numbers). But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can assign the largest available b to the largest available a to maximize Vasya's total? \n\n  However, wait: we are not forced to assign the largest a to the largest b. We can choose which a is assigned to which b.\n\n  But note: we are only concerned with Vasya's total. We are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose one pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya and assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n  However, the condition: Vasya must have a total at least x. But we are trying to minimize the number of participants with total greater than or equal to Vasya's total (to get the best rank).\n\n  Actually, to get the best rank, we can set Vasya's total to be as high as possible (so that we can have fewer participants with higher total). But wait, we might not need to maximize his total: we just need to have enough participants with total less than Vasya's total.\n\n  Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n  Let T = { a_i + b_j for all pairs } but we are going to assign the entire set.\n\n  We are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can control the entire set of totals.\n\n  However, note: we are forming n pairs (each from A and B) and then we have n totals. The best rank for Vasya is 1 (if we can make his total the highest). \n\n  How can we assign the second list to the first list so that Vasya's total is as high as possible? Actually, we can set Vasya's total to the maximum possible total (which is the maximum of a_i + b_j for i in [0, n-1] and j in [0, n-1]). But wait, we have to assign all the numbers. However, we can choose which a and b form Vasya's pair, and then assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n  But note: the maximum total we can form for Vasya is limited by the maximum a and maximum b? Actually, we can assign the maximum a and maximum b to Vasya if we want, provided we are allowed to use the same maximum from the other list? Actually, no: because the two lists are independent, we can assign the maximum b to the maximum a, then Vasya can be (max(a), max(b)).\n\n  Similarly, for the worst place, we want to minimize Vasya's total (but at least x) and then see how many participants have a higher total.\n\n  However, wait: the problem says that Vasya must have at least x. So the minimum total for Vasya is x (if we can form a total of x) or more.\n\n  But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily. So for the best place:\n\n    We can assign the entire set so that Vasya gets the highest total. Then, how many participants have total >= Vasya's total? Only Vasya and maybe others that we cannot avoid? Actually, we can assign the rest of the pairs to have totals strictly less than Vasya's total.\n\n    How? We assign the largest a and largest b to Vasya. Then, we assign the remaining a's and b's to form the rest of the pairs. We can try to assign the next largest a and next largest b to someone else, but we can also break up the large numbers so that no one else gets a very high total.\n\n    Actually, the best rank is 1 if we can make Vasya's total strictly greater than all others. But sometimes we cannot: if there are multiple pairs that can have the same maximum total.\n\n    However, note: the problem allows the jury to assign arbitrarily the places when there are ties. In the best case, we can assign the tie-breaking in our favor (so that Vasya is first even if there is a tie). But wait: the problem says \"the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places according to their choice.\"\n\n    So in the best case, we can have Vasya as the first even if there are others with the same total.\n\n    But note: the problem does not specify that we can break ties arbitrarily in our favor. Actually, the problem says \"it is up to the jury\", meaning we can choose the tie-breaking rule arbitrarily (for the purpose of calculating best and worst). So for the best rank, we can assume that when there is a tie, Vasya is ranked higher than others.\n\n    Similarly, for the worst rank, we assume that when there is a tie, Vasya is ranked as low as possible.\n\n    Therefore, the best rank is 1 if we can form a total for Vasya that is at least as high as the next highest total (and we can break ties arbitrarily). But actually, we can always break ties arbitrarily. So the best rank is the number of participants with total strictly greater than Vasya's total plus 1 (if we break ties in his favor, then the ties are considered as not increasing his rank).\n\n    However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily the entire pairing. So we can choose Vasya's total and the distribution of the rest.\n\n    Steps:\n\n    Let M = maximum total (max(a_i) + max(b_j))? Not necessarily, because we can assign the largest a and largest b to Vasya, then the next largest a and next largest b to the next participant, etc.\n\n    But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can set Vasya's total to any value as long as there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) that sums to that value (and we use each element exactly once). However, we are constrained by the two multisets.\n\n    Alternative approach:\n\n    We can consider the following:\n\n      Let S be the multiset of all a_i and T be the multiset of all b_j.\n\n      We are going to form n pairs (a, b) from S and T (without repetition). Then, we sort the pairs by the sum (descending). Then, we assign the ranks: the highest sum gets rank 1, then the next highest gets rank 2, but if there are ties, we can break arbitrarily.\n\n    But we are allowed to choose which pair is Vasya's (subject to having total>=x). Then, we can assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n    However, note: we are not forced to assign the entire set arbitrarily to get the best rank. We can choose the entire pairing arbitrarily.\n\n    Steps for best place:\n\n      We want to minimize the number of participants with total > Vasya's total, and then we can break ties arbitrarily (so the number of participants with total equal to Vasya's total can be handled by giving Vasya the next available spot).\n\n      Actually, the best rank is the smallest integer k such that there are at most k-1 participants with total strictly greater than Vasya's total.\n\n      But we can choose Vasya's total arbitrarily (as long as we can form it from the sets) and we can assign the rest arbitrarily.\n\n      However, we are constrained by the entire set. We must use all the numbers.\n\n      We can use a greedy approach:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute the maximum total (for Vasya) we can form? Actually, we can form the maximum total by taking the maximum a and maximum b.\n\n        But wait: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can form a pair (a, b) for Vasya with the maximum total, and then for the other participants, we can assign the remaining a's and b's arbitrarily.\n\n        Then, the best rank is determined by: how many participants have total greater than Vasya's total? We can minimize that by making Vasya's total as high as possible.\n\n        However, we cannot necessarily set Vasya's total to the absolute maximum because we have to assign the rest. But note: we are free to assign the rest arbitrarily, so we can assign the remaining numbers to form as few high totals as possible.\n\n        Actually, the best rank is 1 if there is no participant (other than Vasya) that must have a total >= Vasya's total? \n\n        But wait: we are forced to use the entire set. So if we assign the two largest numbers to Vasya, then the remaining numbers might still form pairs that have the same total as Vasya's? \n\n        Example: \n          n=2, x=0, a=[1,2], b=[1,2]\n          Maximum total for Vasya is 4 (using 2 and 2). Then the remaining numbers are 1 and 1, which forms a total of 2. Then the two totals are 4 and 2. Then Vasya is first.\n\n        But consider:\n          n=2, x=0, a=[1,2], b=[2,1]\n          Maximum total for Vasya is 3 (using 2 and 2). Then the remaining numbers are 1 and 1 -> total 2. Then Vasya is first.\n\n        However, what if we have two participants and the totals are [3,2]. Then Vasya is first.\n\n        But what if we have:\n\n          n=3, a=[10,2,3], b=[10,2,3]\n\n          If we assign the maximum (10,10) to Vasya, then the remaining a=[2,3] and b=[2,3]. Then we can form two pairs: (2,3)=5 and (3,2)=5. Then the totals are [20,5,5]. Then Vasya is first.\n\n        However, we are forced to use the entire set. We cannot avoid using the 10 and 10 for Vasya.\n\n        But wait: what if we don't use the maximum for Vasya? Maybe we can get a better rank by having a lower total? No, because if we use a lower total for Vasya, then the participant with 20 (the maximum) would be above him.\n\n        Actually, the best rank is achieved by maximizing Vasya's total. Then, the rank is 1 plus the number of participants that have a total strictly greater than Vasya's total.\n\n        But in the example above, no one has a total greater than 20, so rank 1.\n\n        However, consider:\n\n          n=3, a=[10, 1, 1], b=[10, 1, 1]\n\n          If we assign (10,10) to Vasya, then the remaining two pairs: (1,1) and (1,1) -> total 2. Then the totals: [20,2,2]. Then Vasya is first.\n\n        Now, what if we have:\n\n          n=3, a=[10,9,8], b=[10,9,8]\n\n          We assign (10,10) to Vasya: total 20.\n          Then the rest: \n            Option1: (9,9)=18, (8,8)=16 -> then the totals: [20,18,16] -> Vasya is first.\n          Option2: (9,8)=17, (8,9)=17 -> then the totals: [20,17,17] -> Vasya is first (since 20>17).\n\n        But now, what if we don't assign the maximum to Vasya? Then Vasya might have 18 or 17, but then there is at least one participant with 20 (if we leave the (10,10) for someone else) or if we break the assignment differently, then the maximum total might be 20 (by someone else). Then Vasya's rank would be worse.\n\n        Therefore, the best rank is achieved by maximizing Vasya's total.\n\n        Similarly, for the worst place:\n\n          We want to minimize Vasya's total (but at least x) and then maximize the number of participants with total greater than Vasya's total (so that his rank is as low as possible). \n\n        However, we must use the entire set. We can assign arbitrarily, so we can choose which pair is Vasya's.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let T be the multiset of all a_i and U be the multiset of all b_j.\n\n          We are going to form n pairs (a,b) from T and U.\n\n          We want to assign the numbers so that:\n\n            - One of the pairs (Vasya's) has total >= x (given).\n            - We want to minimize Vasya's total (so that he has the lowest total that still meets the condition) and then maximize the number of pairs that have total strictly greater than Vasya's total.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose which pair is Vasya's. However, we must use all the numbers.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          Step 1: Sort both arrays a and b.\n\n          Step 2: To compute the best rank:\n\n            We want to maximize Vasya's total. The maximum total is the maximum element in a plus the maximum element in b.\n\n            Then, we have to assign the rest. But note: we can assign the rest arbitrarily, so we can try to minimize the number of participants that have total greater than Vasya's total.\n\n            However, we must use the entire set. So we have to count: how many participants (from the entire set) must have a total >= Vasya's total? \n\n            Actually, we can assign the rest arbitrarily, so we can assign the rest to have totals as low as possible, but we cannot avoid that some participants might have high totals if we use the high numbers.\n\n            But wait: we are assigning the entire set. We have already taken the two highest numbers (max_a and max_b) for Vasya. Then the rest are the other numbers.\n\n            Then, the best rank is 1 (because we can break ties arbitrarily) if we can assign the rest so that no one else has total >= Vasya's total.\n\n            However, we must check: is it possible that there is another pair (from the remaining numbers) that has total >= Vasya's total?\n\n            Actually, no: because Vasya's total is the maximum. The rest are from the remaining numbers, which are <= max_a and <= max_b. So the maximum total for the rest is (max_a2 + max_b2) where max_a2 is the next highest in a and max_b2 is the next highest in b. But wait, we took the two maximums. Then the next highest is the next one.\n\n            However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily the rest. So we can try to avoid having any participant with total >= Vasya's total. But note: Vasya's total is the maximum, so the rest will be less. Then why would there be a problem?\n\n            Actually, the issue is: we are forced to use all the numbers. But if we take the two maximums for Vasya, then the rest are the other numbers. Then the maximum total in the rest is the maximum of (a_i + b_j) for the remaining a_i and b_j. This is less than or equal to the maximum total (unless there are duplicates). \n\n            Example: \n              a = [10,10,1,1], b=[10,10,1,1]\n              Vasya takes one 10 from a and one 10 from b -> total 20.\n              Then the rest: [10,1,1] and [10,1,1] -> we can form pairs that have 10+10=20. So there are two participants with total 20.\n\n            Then, the best rank for Vasya is 1 (if we break ties arbitrarily) because the problem allows the jury to assign the first place arbitrarily. But note: the problem says \"the first place has the participant who has got the most points\", and if there is a tie, the jury can choose. So we can put Vasya first even if there is another with the same total.\n\n            Therefore, the best rank is 1.\n\n            But wait: what if we have two participants with total 20? Then the ranking: \n              Place 1: one of the 20s (we choose Vasya)\n              Place 2: the other 20? But then the next places: then the other two are 2, so they are below.\n\n            So the best rank is 1.\n\n            However, what if we cannot avoid having others with the same total? Then we still can break the tie arbitrarily to put Vasya first.\n\n            Therefore, the best rank is the number of participants with total strictly greater than Vasya's total (in the entire set) plus 1 (if we break ties in his favor). But wait, in the example above, there are no participants with total strictly greater than 20, and we break the tie arbitrarily (so we don't count the tied ones as increasing his rank). \n\n            Actually, the rank is defined as:\n\n              Rank 1: the highest total (and if multiple, we can choose to put Vasya first).\n              Then the next rank is 2 (for the next distinct total) and then the tied ones get the same rank (but then the next distinct total gets the next consecutive rank).\n\n            However, the problem says: \"the best and the worst place\", meaning the position (the smallest integer) that Vasya can be placed.\n\n            In the best case, we can put Vasya at position 1.\n\n            But wait: what if there are many participants with the same total as Vasya? Then the best rank we can get is 1, and the worst rank is (number of participants with total >= Vasya's total) (because we break ties arbitrarily to push him as low as possible).\n\n            Actually, the problem does not specify that the tie-breaking is done in a fixed way. We are to find the best and worst possible rank (the smallest and largest integer) that Vasya can be assigned.\n\n            Therefore, the best rank is the minimal rank we can achieve (by breaking ties arbitrarily in his favor) and the worst rank is the maximal rank we can achieve (by breaking ties arbitrarily against him).\n\n            Steps for best rank:\n\n              Let T_v be Vasya's total (we choose the maximum total, i.e., max_a + max_b).\n\n              Then, we need to count the minimal number of participants that must have total strictly greater than T_v (call this g) and the number of participants that have total equal to T_v (call this e). Then the best rank is: g + 1 (because we can break the ties arbitrarily, so the tied participants (e) do not increase his rank beyond g+1).\n\n            But wait: is it necessary that all participants with total >= T_v must be accounted for? Actually, we can break ties arbitrarily, so we can assign Vasya to be the first among those with total T_v.\n\n            Therefore, the best rank is: (number of participants with total strictly greater than T_v) + 1.\n\n            However, note: we can choose the entire pairing arbitrarily. So we can assign the two maximums to Vasya and then assign the rest arbitrarily. Then, the participants with total strictly greater than T_v: none (since T_v is the maximum). So best rank = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n            But wait: what if there are multiple ways to assign and we cannot avoid having a participant with total > T_v? Then that participant would force Vasya to be at least rank 2.\n\n            Actually, we are maximizing Vasya's total, so we are using the two maximums. Then, the rest cannot exceed T_v (unless there are duplicates). \n\n            However, if there are duplicates, then we might have to assign a pair (max_a, max_b) to someone else? Actually, no: we are the one choosing which pair is Vasya's. We can choose the pair (max_a, max_b) for Vasya. Then, the rest are the remaining numbers.\n\n            But note: if the maximum a appears multiple times and the maximum b appears multiple times, then we can assign one occurrence of the maximum a and one occurrence of the maximum b to Vasya, and then the remaining maximum a and maximum b can be used to form another high total.\n\n            Example: \n              a = [10,10,1,1], b=[10,10,1,1]\n              Vasya takes one 10 from a and one 10 from b -> total 20.\n              Then we have a = [10,1,1] and b=[10,1,1] left.\n              Then we can form: (10,10)=20, (1,1)=2, (1,1)=2.\n\n            Then, there is another participant with total 20. Then, the best rank for Vasya is 1 (if we break the tie in his favor) and the worst rank is 2 (if we break the tie against him, then the other 20 gets rank 1 and Vasya gets rank 2).\n\n            But wait: the problem asks for the best and the worst place. So in the best case, Vasya is 1st; in the worst case, 2nd.\n\n            However, how do we compute the best rank? We must account for the possibility that after we take the two maximums, there are other pairs that can also form the same total (because of duplicate maximums). \n\n            Actually, the best rank is determined by:\n\n              Let T_max = max(a) + max(b)\n\n              Then, we can form at least (count_max_a * count_max_b) pairs with total T_max.\n\n              Then, the minimal rank Vasya can get is:\n\n                Let k = number of pairs (from the entire set) that have total strictly greater than T_max. (This is 0 if T_max is the maximum, unless there is a pair that sums to more than T_max? But T_max is the maximum.)\n\n                Then, the best rank is k + 1.\n\n            But wait, what if there are multiple pairs with total T_max? Then the best rank is still k+1 (because we can break the tie arbitrarily and put Vasya first among the T_max group). \n\n            However, we must consider: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose which pair is Vasya's. But we are constrained by the entire set. \n\n            Actually, the above example shows that even if we take the two maximums, there might be another pair (from the remaining numbers) that also has total T_max. Then, the number of pairs with total >= T_max is at least 2 (including Vasya). Then, the best rank is 1 (because we can break the tie arbitrarily and put Vasya first) and the worst rank is 2 (if we break the tie against him).\n\n            But wait: the entire set of pairs is fixed (we are not changing the multiset of a and b). The maximum total is fixed. The number of pairs that can have total T_max is the product of the frequency of the maximum a and the frequency of the maximum b. \n\n            However, we are assigning the second list arbitrarily to the first list. So we can control which pairs get which totals.\n\n            Actually, the entire set of pairs is fixed (the two multisets) and we are forming a bijection. The total number of pairs with total T_max is the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i = max_a and b_j = max_b. But we are forming a bijection, so we can only use each element once.\n\n            Therefore, the maximum number of pairs with total T_max is min(count_max_a, count_max_b). \n\n            Example: a=[10,10,10], b=[10,10,10] -> we can form 3 pairs of (10,10). But wait, we have to assign each element of a to one element of b. Then, the maximum number of (10,10) pairs is min(count_max_a, count_max_b) = 3? Actually, no: we have 3 a's and 3 b's, so we can form 3 pairs of (10,10). \n\n            Then, if we assign all three 10's to Vasya? Actually, no: Vasya is one participant. We can only assign one pair to Vasya.\n\n            So the entire set has n pairs. We are allowed to assign the second list arbitrarily to the first list. Then, the entire set of pairs must cover all a's and all b's.\n\n            Then, the total number of pairs with total T_max is the number of a_i that are max_a multiplied by the number of b_j that are max_b? No, because we are forming a bijection. The maximum number of pairs with total T_max is the minimum between the count of max_a and count_max_b? Actually, no: we can assign each max_a to a max_b, but if there are more max_a than max_b, then the extra max_a must be assigned to non-max_b, so the total number of (max_a, max_b) pairs is min(count_max_a, count_max_b).\n\n            But wait, we are not limited by the entire set? Actually, we are: we have to assign each element exactly once.\n\n            Therefore, the entire set can have at most min(count_max_a, count_max_b) pairs with total T_max.\n\n            Now, if we choose Vasya's pair to be (max_a, max_b), then the remaining set has (count_max_a - 1) max_a's and (count_max_b - 1) max_b's. Then, the maximum number of pairs with total T_max in the entire set is min(count_max_a, count_max_b). Then, the number of pairs (including Vasya) with total T_max is at least 1 (Vasya) and at most min(count_max_a, count_max_b).\n\n            Then, the best rank for Vasya is:\n\n              Let g = number of pairs (from the entire set) that have total strictly greater than T_max. (This is 0, because T_max is the maximum.)\n\n              Then, the best rank is g + 1 (because we can break the ties arbitrarily, so we can put Vasya first even if there are other pairs with total T_max).\n\n            But wait: is that true? Yes, because the problem says the jury can assign arbitrarily the places in case of ties.\n\n            Therefore, the best rank is always 1? \n\n            However, consider: what if T_max is not unique? Actually, no: T_max is defined as the maximum of a_i + b_j, so it is the maximum. But there might be multiple pairs achieving T_max.\n\n            The best rank is 1 because we can assign the first place arbitrarily to Vasya (even if there are others with the same total).\n\n            Similarly, the worst rank is the total number of participants that have total >= T_max (because we can break the ties arbitrarily to push Vasya to the last among the ones with total >= T_max).\n\n            But wait: in the example above, if there are 3 pairs with total T_max, then the worst rank is 3 (if we break the ties arbitrarily against Vasya). \n\n            However, we must consider that we are not forced to use the maximum total for Vasya. The problem says that Vasya has at least x. So we can choose a lower total for Vasya as well.\n\n            Actually, the problem does not require Vasya to have the maximum total. He only needs at least x. \n\n            Therefore, we have two parts:\n\n              Best rank: achieved by maximizing Vasya's total (so that we minimize the number of participants with higher total). But note: we can also choose a total that is not the maximum to get a better rank? Actually, no:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The key insight is that the ranking depends on how we pair the participants' scores from the two tours, and we can choose the pairing to minimize or maximize Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We are given two lists of integers representing scores from the first and second tours. Each participant has one score from each list.\n   - Vasya's total points must be at least `x`. We need to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) rank he can achieve by optimally pairing the scores.\n   - The rank is determined by sorting all participants by their total points (sum of scores from both tours). In case of ties, the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Rank**: To achieve the best rank, Vasya should have the highest possible total points. This is done by pairing the highest score from the first list with the highest score from the second list. However, if there are duplicate maximum values, other participants might also have the same total. The best rank is 1 plus the number of participants with strictly higher totals than Vasya's.\n   - **Worst Rank**: To achieve the worst rank, Vasya should have the minimum possible total points that is still at least `x`. The worst rank is determined by counting all participants who have higher or equal totals than Vasya's, then finding the smallest rank position where Vasya fits when others are ranked higher.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Both lists are sorted to easily access the highest and lowest values.\n   - **Two-Pointer Technique**: Used to efficiently count the number of valid pairs (participants) for Vasya's potential totals.\n   - **Binary Search**: For the worst rank, binary search helps quickly find the number of participants with totals greater than or equal to Vasya's minimum required total.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Sorting**: O(n log n) for both lists.\n   - **Two-Pointer/Linear Scan**: O(n) for counting valid pairs in the best rank calculation.\n   - **Binary Search**: O(log n) per query in the worst rank calculation.\n   - Overall complexity is O(n log n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    # Best rank: maximize Vasya's total\n    max_a = a_list[-1]\n    max_b = b_list[-1]\n    T_max = max_a + max_b\n    \n    # Count the frequency of max_a and max_b\n    count_a_max = a_list.count(max_a)\n    count_b_max = b_list.count(max_b)\n    total_max_pairs = min(count_a_max, count_b_max)\n    \n    # Now, calculate the number of participants with total strictly greater than T_max\n    # But since T_max is the maximum, there are none. So g = 0.\n    best_rank = 1\n    \n    # Worst rank: minimize Vasya's total (but at least x) and then count how many participants have total >= that minimum.\n    # We need to find the minimal total T_min such that T_min >= x and T_min is achievable by some pair (a_i, b_j).\n    # But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya as long as a_i + b_j >= x.\n    # However, to get the worst rank, we want to choose the minimal T_min (just above x) but actually we want to minimize Vasya's rank, so we choose the smallest T_min >= x that allows us to have as many participants as possible with total >= T_min.\n    #\n    # Actually, the worst rank is computed by:\n    #   Let T be Vasya's total (which must be >= x). Then, the rank is the number of participants (including Vasya) that have total >= T, because in the worst case, the jury can assign him the last position among those with total >= T.\n    #\n    # But note: we can choose T (any value >= x) and we want to maximize the number of participants with total >= T (so that Vasya's rank is as low as possible).\n    #\n    # However, the minimal T is x, but if there are not enough participants with total >= x, we might need to consider higher T? Actually, no: we want to minimize Vasya's rank, so we choose the smallest T (>= x) that is achievable, and then count all participants with total >= T. But note: we can choose any T >= x, so to maximize the number of participants with total >= T, we should choose the smallest T (>= x) that is achievable by at least one pair.\n    #\n    # How to compute the worst rank?\n    #   Step 1: We need to find the minimal total T0 (>= x) that can be formed by some pair (a_i, b_j). However, there might be multiple pairs achieving the same T0.\n    #   Step 2: But note: we are forming a bijection (each element used once). So the minimal T0 is the minimal sum of two numbers (one from a_list and one from b_list) that is >= x. However, we can also choose a larger T0 if it results in more participants having total >= T0.\n    #\n    # Actually, to maximize the number of participants with total >= T, we should choose T as small as possible (i.e., the minimal T >= x that exists). Why? Because if T is larger, fewer participants will have total >= T.\n    #\n    # But wait: the problem does not require Vasya to have the minimal total. He just needs at least x. However, to get the worst rank, we want to be overtaken by as many participants as possible, so we choose the minimal total that meets the requirement. Then, count all participants (including Vasya) who have total >= that minimal total. The worst rank is that count (because they are all tied at the bottom).\n    #\n    # However, we must consider: the entire set of participants is fixed (n participants). The minimal total T0 (>= x) is found by scanning the sorted lists. But note: we can form a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya with total T0, and then the rest of the participants are formed by the remaining numbers. But the condition is that Vasya's total must be >= x, and we want to minimize his rank, so we choose the smallest T0 >= x that can be formed.\n    #\n    # But note: the minimal T0 might not be unique. We need to count the number of pairs (including Vasya) that have total >= T0. However, the entire set of pairs must use all numbers exactly once. So the minimal T0 is the minimal sum of any two numbers (one from a_list and one from b_list) that is >= x.\n    #\n    # Steps for worst rank:\n    #   Let T_min = minimal sum >= x that can be formed from a_list and b_list.\n    #   Then, we need to count the total number of pairs (from the entire set) that have sum >= T_min. But note: the entire set is formed by a bijection between a_list and b_list. However, we are allowed to choose the pairing arbitrarily, so we can choose the minimal T_min and then count all pairs (from the entire set) that have sum >= T_min.\n    #\n    # But wait: the entire set's pairs are fixed (we must use all numbers). The minimal T_min is fixed, but the distribution of the entire set's pairs can vary. However, we can choose the pairing to maximize the number of pairs with sum >= T_min. But note: we are already fixing Vasya's pair to have sum T_min. Then, the rest of the pairs must use the remaining numbers.\n    #\n    # Actually, the problem requires us to consider the entire set of participants (all n pairs). The worst rank is the total number of participants (n) minus the maximum number of participants that can be formed with total < T_min (the minimal total >= x), but then including Vasya.\n    #\n    # Alternatively, we can think:\n    #   Let F(T) = number of pairs (from the entire set) that have sum >= T.\n    #   Then, for T_min (minimal T >= x), the worst rank is F(T_min) (because Vasya is included in these F(T_min) participants, and in the worst case, he is ranked last among them).\n    #\n    # How to compute F(T) for a given T?\n    #   Since the entire set is formed by a bijection, the maximum number of pairs with sum >= T is limited by the counts of numbers. But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so the maximum number of pairs with sum >= T is the maximum matching in a bipartite graph where edges exist between a_i and b_j if a_i + b_j >= T. However, this is too complex for n up to 10^5.\n    #\n    # Instead, we can use a greedy approach:\n    #   Sort both lists.\n    #   For a given T, the number of pairs with sum >= T is the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= T. But note: we are forming a bijection, so we cannot simply count all pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= T because each element is used once.\n    #\n    # Actually, the problem does not require the entire set's pairs to be considered for the worst rank in the same way. We are only concerned with Vasya's rank, and we can choose the pairing arbitrarily. Therefore, for the worst rank, we choose the minimal T_min (>= x) and then count the total number of pairs (from the entire set) that have sum >= T_min. But note: the entire set must use all numbers, so the total number of pairs with sum >= T_min is not independent of the pairing.\n    #\n    # Correction: We are allowed to choose the entire pairing arbitrarily (as long as each element is used once). Therefore, we can choose the pairing that maximizes the number of pairs with sum >= T_min (to make Vasya's rank as bad as possible). But wait, no: for the worst rank, we want to minimize Vasya's rank, so we want as many participants as possible to have total >= T_min (so that Vasya is pushed down). Therefore, we choose the minimal T_min (>= x) and then the maximum number of pairs (from the entire set) that can have sum >= T_min is the answer for the count, but note: we are constrained by the available numbers.\n    #\n    # Actually, the worst rank is computed as follows:\n    #   Let T_min be the minimal sum >= x that can be formed (if no such sum exists, but the problem guarantees at least one pair with sum>=x).\n    #   Then, we need to count the maximum number of pairs (from the entire set) that can have sum >= T_min. But note: we are forming a bijection, so the maximum number of pairs with sum >= T_min is the size of the maximum matching in a bipartite graph where edges exist between a_i and b_j if a_i + b_j >= T_min. This is a complex problem.\n    #\n    # Alternative Insight for Worst Rank:\n    #   We can use a two-pointer technique to count the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= x, but that counts all pairs, not considering the bijection constraint.\n    #\n    # Given the complexity, let's simplify:\n    #   The worst rank is the total number of participants (n) minus the maximum number of participants that can be formed with total < x (but note: Vasya must have at least x, so the participants with total < x do not include Vasya). However, the problem does not require Vasya to be the one with the minimal total; he can have any total >= x.\n    #\n    # After careful thought, here's a better approach for the worst rank:\n    #   We want to find the largest integer k such that there are at least k participants with total >= x. Then, the worst rank is k (because Vasya is one of them, and in the worst case, he is the k-th).\n    #\n    # But note: the problem guarantees at least one participant (Vasya) with total >= x.\n    #\n    # How to compute k?\n    #   k is the maximum number of participants that can have total >= x, given the two lists. But note: we can choose the pairing arbitrarily. So k is the maximum matching in the bipartite graph where edges exist between a_i and b_j if a_i + b_j >= x. This is equivalent to: sort both lists, then use two pointers to count the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n    #\n    # Steps for k:\n    #   Sort both lists.\n    #   Use two pointers (or binary search) to count the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= x, but note: we are allowed to use each element once, so we need a matching.\n    #\n    # Actually, the problem is similar to \"Assign Cookies\" but for two sorted lists. We can use a greedy approach:\n    #   Sort a_list and b_list in descending order.\n    #   Then, for each participant, try to assign the smallest b_j that is >= (x - a_i). But this is complex.\n    #\n    # However, note the following: the worst rank is the total number of participants with total >= x (in the entire set) because we can choose the pairing to maximize the number of participants with total >= x. Then, Vasya is one of them, and his worst rank is the count of these participants.\n    #\n    # But wait: we can choose the pairing arbitrarily, so the maximum number of participants with total >= x is the maximum matching in the bipartite graph defined by the condition a_i + b_j >= x. This can be computed by:\n    #   Sort a_list in ascending order.\n    #   Sort b_list in descending order.\n    #   Then, for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >= x. But this is not straightforward.\n    #\n    # Given the complexity, we can instead use a different approach:\n    #   Let's define an array c where c[i] = the minimal b_j needed for a_i to have total >= x, i.e., b_j >= x - a_i.\n    #   Then, the number of participants with total >= x is the number of a_i for which there exists a b_j >= (x - a_i) and that b_j hasn't been used.\n    #\n    # But this is essentially the bipartite matching problem, which can be solved with a greedy algorithm after sorting.\n    #\n    # Steps for computing the maximum number of participants with total >= x (k):\n    #   1. Sort a_list in ascending order.\n    #   2. Sort b_list in descending order.\n    #   3. Use two pointers: for each a_i, find the smallest b_j (from the start of the b_list) such that b_j >= (x - a_i). But since b_list is sorted descending, we can use a pointer for b_list and traverse a_list.\n    #\n    # Actually, we can do:\n    #   Sort a_list (ascending) and b_list (descending).\n    #   Let j = 0\n    #   For i in range(n):\n    #       While j < n and b_list[j] + a_list[i] < x:\n    #           j += 1\n    #       If j < n, then we can match a_list[i] with b_list[j], and then j += 1.\n    #\n    # But this counts the maximum matching where each a_i is matched to a b_j such that a_i + b_j >= x.

This involves iterating through the sorted lists to find valid pairs that meet the minimum total requirement.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages sorting and two-pointer techniques to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",

Actually, no: we want to minimize Vasya's rank, so we choose the smallest T (>= x) that is achievable, and then count all participants with total >= T. But note: we can choose any T >= x, so to maximize the number of participants with total >= T, we should choose the smallest T (>= x) that is achievable by at least one pair.\n    #\n    # How to compute the worst rank?\n    #   Step 1: We need to find the minimal total T0 (>= x) that can be formed by some pair (a_i, b_j). However, there might be multiple pairs achieving the same T0.\n    #   Step 2: But note: we are forming a bijection (each element used once). So the minimal T0 is the minimal sum of two numbers (one from a_list and one from b_list) that is >= x. However, we can also choose a larger T0 if it results in more participants having total >= T0.\n    #\n    # Actually, to maximize the number of participants with total >= T, we should choose T as small as possible (i.e., the minimal T >= x that exists). Why? Because if T is larger, fewer participants will have total >= T.\n    #\n    # But wait: the problem does not require Vasya to have the minimal total. He just needs at least x. However, to get the worst rank, we want to be overtaken by as many participants as possible, so we choose the minimal total that meets the requirement. Then, count all participants (including Vasya) who have total >= that minimal total. The worst rank is that count (because they are all tied at the bottom).\n    #\n    # However, we must consider: the entire set of participants is fixed (n participants). The minimal total T0 (>= x) is found by scanning the sorted lists. But note: we can form a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya with total T0, and then the rest of the participants are formed by the remaining numbers. But the condition is that Vasya's total must be >= x, and we want to minimize his rank, so we choose the smallest T0 >= x that can be formed.\n    #\n    # But note: the minimal T0 might not be unique. We need to count the number of pairs (including Vasya) that have total >= T0. However, the entire set of pairs must use all numbers exactly once. So the minimal T0 is the minimal sum of any two numbers (one from a_list and one from b_list) that is >= x.\n    #\n    # Steps for worst rank:\n    #   Let T_min = minimal sum >= x that can be formed from a_list and b_list.\n    #   Then, we need to count the total number of pairs (from the entire set) that have sum >= T_min. But note: the entire set is formed by a bijection between a_list and b_list. However, we are allowed to choose the pairing arbitrarily, so we can choose the minimal T_min and then count all pairs (from the entire set) that have sum >= T_min.\n    #\n    # But wait: the entire set's pairs are fixed (we must use all numbers). The minimal T_min is fixed, but the distribution of the entire set's pairs can vary. However, we can choose the pairing to maximize the number of pairs with sum >= T_min. But note: we are already fixing Vasya's pair to have sum T_min. Then, the rest of the pairs must use the remaining numbers.\n    #\n    # Actually, the problem requires us to consider the entire set of participants (all n pairs). The worst rank is the total number of participants (n) minus the maximum number of participants that can be formed with total < T_min (the minimal total >= x), but then including Vasya.\n    #\n    # Alternatively, we can think:\n    #   Let F(T) = number of pairs (from the entire set) that have sum >= T.\n    #   Then, for T_min (minimal T >= x), the worst rank is F(T_min) (because Vasya is included in these F(T_min) participants, and in the worst case, he is ranked last among them).\n    #\n    # How to compute F(T) for a given T?\n    #   Since the entire set is formed by a bijection, the maximum number of pairs with sum >= T is limited by the counts of numbers. But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily, so the maximum number of pairs with sum >= T is the maximum matching in a bipartite graph where edges exist between a_i and b_j if a_i + b_j >= T. However, this is too complex for n up to 10^5.\n    #\n    # Instead, we can use a greedy approach:\n    #   Sort both lists.\n    #   For a given T, the number of pairs with sum >= T is the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= T. But note: we are forming a bijection, so we cannot simply count all pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= T because each element is used once.\n    #\n    # Actually, the problem does not require the entire set's pairs to be considered for the worst rank in the same way. We are only concerned with Vasya's rank, and we can choose the pairing arbitrarily. Therefore, for the worst rank, we choose the minimal T_min (>= x) and then count the total number of pairs (from the entire set) that have sum >= T_min. But note: the entire set must use all numbers, so the total number of pairs with sum >= T_min is not independent of the pairing.\n    #\n    # Correction: We are allowed to choose the entire pairing arbitrarily (as long as each element is used once). Therefore, we can choose the pairing that maximizes the number of pairs with sum >= T_min (to make Vasya's rank as bad as possible). But wait, no: for the worst rank, we want to minimize Vasya's rank, so we want as many participants as possible to have total >= T_min (so that Vasya is pushed down). Therefore, we choose the minimal T_min (>= x) and then the maximum number of pairs (from the entire set) that can have sum >= T_min is the answer for the count, but note: we are constrained by the available numbers.\n    #\n    # Actually, the worst rank is computed as follows:\n    #   Let T_min be the minimal sum >= x that can be formed (if no such sum exists, but the problem guarantees at least one pair with sum>=x).\n    #   Then, we need to count the maximum number of pairs (from the entire set) that can have sum >= T_min. But note: we are forming a bijection, so the maximum number of pairs with sum >= T_min is the size of the maximum matching in a bipartite graph where edges exist between a_i and b_j if a_i + b_j >= T_min. This is a complex problem.\n    #\n    # Alternative Insight for Worst Rank:\n    #   We can use a two-pointer technique to count the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= x, but that counts all pairs, not considering the bijection constraint.\n    #\n    # Given the complexity, let's simplify:\n    #   The worst rank is the total number of participants (n) minus the maximum number of participants that can be formed with total < x (but note: Vasya must have at least x, so the participants with total < x do not include Vasya). However, the problem does not require Vasya to be the one with the minimal total; he can have any total >= x.\n    #\n    # After careful thought, here's a better approach for the worst rank:\n    #   We want to find the largest integer k such that there are at least k participants with total >= x. Then, the worst rank is k (because Vasya is one of them, and in the worst case, he is the k-th).\n    #\n    # But note: the problem guarantees at least one participant (Vasya) with total >= x.\n    #\n    # How to compute k?\n    #   k is the maximum number of participants that can have total >= x, given the two lists. But note: we can choose the pairing arbitrarily. So k is the maximum matching in the bipartite graph where edges exist between a_i and b_j if a_i + b_j >= x. This is equivalent to: sort both lists, then use two pointers to count the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n    #\n    # Steps for k:\n    #   Sort both lists.\n    #   Use two pointers (or binary search) to count the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= x, but note: we are allowed to use each element once, so we need a matching.\n    #\n    # Actually, the problem is similar to \"Assign Cookies\" but for two sorted lists. We can use a greedy approach:\n    #   Sort a_list and b_list in descending order.\n    #   Then, for each participant, try to assign the smallest b_j that is >= (x - a_i). But this is complex.\n    #\n    # However, note the following: the worst rank is the total number of participants with total >= x (in the entire set) because we can choose the pairing to maximize the number of participants with total >= x. Then, Vasya is one of them, and his worst rank is the count of these participants.\n    #\n    # But wait: we can choose the pairing arbitrarily, so the maximum number of participants with total >= x is the maximum matching in the bipartite graph defined by the condition a_i + b_j >= x. This can be computed by:\n    #   Sort a_list in ascending order.\n    #   Sort b_list in descending order.\n    #   Then, for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >= x. But this is not straightforward.\n    #\n    # Given the complexity, we can instead use a different approach:\n    #   Let's define an array c where c[i] = the minimal b_j needed for a_i to have total >= x, i.e., b_j >= x - a_i.\n    #   Then, the number of participants with total >= x is the number of a_i for which there exists a b_j >= (x - a_i) and that b_j hasn't been used.\n    #\n    # But this is essentially the bipartite matching problem, which can be solved with a greedy algorithm after sorting.\n    #\n    # Steps for computing the maximum number of participants with total >= x (k):\n    #   1. Sort a_list in ascending order.\n    #   2. Sort b_list in descending order.\n    #   3. Use two pointers: for each a_i, find the smallest b_j (from the start of the b_list) such that b_j >= (x - a_i). But since b_list is sorted descending, we can use a pointer for b_list and traverse a_list.\n    #\n    # Actually, we can do:\n    #   Sort a_list (ascending) and b_list (descending).\n    #   Let j = 0\n    #   For i in range(n):\n    #       While j < n and b_list[j] + a_list[i] < x:\n    #           j += 1\n    #       If j < n, then we can match a_list[i] with b_list[j], and then j += 1.\n    #\n    # But this counts the maximum matching where each a_i is matched to a b_j such that a_i + b_j >= x. This gives k.\n    #\n    # Then, the worst rank is k (the number of participants with total >= x), because Vasya is one of them, and in the worst case, he is ranked last among these k participants.\n    #\n    # However, note: the problem states that Vasya is guaranteed to have at least x, so k is at least 1.\n    #\n    # But wait: what if there are multiple ways to assign the pairs?
