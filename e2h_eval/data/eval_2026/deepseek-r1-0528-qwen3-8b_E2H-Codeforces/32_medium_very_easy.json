    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum value.\n Since the instability is defined as max - min, we can consider:\n   Option 1: Remove the minimum element, then the new array's min is the next smallest and max remains the same (unless there are duplicates).\n   Option 2: Remove the maximum element, then the new array's max is the next largest and min remains the same.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to remove exactly one element. The idea is that we can only remove one element, so we have to choose which one.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the array.\n 2. Consider two cases: \n      Case A: Remove the first element (the smallest). Then the new array is from index 1 to n-1.\n          instability = a[n-1] - a[1]\n      Case B: Remove the last element (the largest). Then the new array is from index 0 to n-2.\n          instability = a[n-2] - a[0]\n\n 3. But wait: what if we remove an element in the middle? Actually, note that the instability is determined by the overall min and max of the remaining array. \n    Removing an element that is not the global min or global max might not change the min or max. Therefore, the best we can do is to remove either the min or the max.\n\n However, consider: what if there are multiple minima or maxima?\n Example: [1, 1, 3, 7] \n   If we remove one of the 1's: \n        Removing the first 1: [1,3,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6\n        Removing the second 1: [1,3,7] -> same as above.\n   But if we remove the 3 or the 7, we get:\n        Removing 3: [1,1,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6\n        Removing 7: [1,1,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2\n\n So it is possible that removing an element that is not the minimum or maximum can lead to a lower instability? \n\n Let me clarify: The instability is defined by the entire array. Removing an element that is not the current min or max doesn't change the min or max (if they are still present). \n Therefore, the only chance to reduce the instability is by removing either the min or the max. \n\n However, note: In the example [1, 1, 3, 7] above, if we remove one of the 1s, the min is still 1 (because there's another 1) and the max is 7. So the instability remains 6. \n But if we remove the 7, then the min is 1 and the max becomes 3, so the instability is 2. \n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min but there's another min? Then the min doesn't change. Similarly for max.\n\n Therefore, the idea is:\n   We must remove one occurrence of the global minimum OR one occurrence of the global maximum.\n\n However, there's a catch: if the array has multiple copies of the minimum, then removing one copy of the minimum doesn't change the min. Similarly for the maximum.\n\n So actually, we need to consider:\n\n   Option 1: Remove an occurrence of the minimum. But if there are multiple minima, then after removal the min becomes the next distinct value (which is the next smallest value). \n        Then the instability becomes: max(a) - (the next smallest value)\n\n   Option 2: Remove an occurrence of the maximum. Similarly, if there are multiple maxima, then after removal the max becomes the next largest value (the next biggest).\n\n But note: the array after removal must be contiguous in the sorted order? Actually, no, but we are allowed to remove any one element.\n\n However, the problem does not require the array to be contiguous, but the instability is defined by the entire array.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   Let the original array be sorted: [b0, b1, ..., bn-1]\n\n   We know that the instability of the entire array is b_{n-1} - b_0.\n\n   After removing one element, we have two possibilities for the new min and max:\n\n   Possibility 1: The new array has min = b0 (if we don't remove b0) and max = b_{n-1} (if we don't remove b_{n-1}), unless we remove one of them.\n\n   Actually, we can also consider that we can remove any element. But note: if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, then the min and max remain the same as the original array (if the min and max are still present). Therefore, the instability would be the same as the original array.\n\n   However, if we remove an element that is the min, then the new min becomes the next smallest (if there was more than one min, then the next smallest is still the same min? Actually no: the next smallest might be the same as the min if duplicates exist. \n\n   Let me reframe:\n\n   We are going to consider the effect of removing one element. The resulting array's min and max will be:\n\n     min' = \n        if we remove an element that is not the unique minimum, then min' = min (original)\n        else (if we remove the unique minimum and there's no other minimum) then min' = next smallest value.\n\n   Similarly for max.\n\n   Therefore, the best we can do is to remove either the minimum or the maximum. But note: if we remove the minimum, the new min might be the same as the original min (if there are duplicates) so the instability might not decrease. \n\n   However, we are trying to minimize the instability. So we can consider:\n\n   candidate1: Remove the first occurrence of the minimum. Then the new min is the next distinct value (or the same if there are duplicates). But wait, we don't care about distinctness, we care about the actual values.\n\n   Actually, let's define:\n\n     Let m = min(a), M = max(a)\n\n   Then, if we remove an element that is m, then the new min is the smallest element in the array that is >= m. But since we removed one m, if there is still at least one m then the new min is still m. Otherwise, the new min is the next value greater than m.\n\n   Similarly for M.\n\n   Therefore, the instability after removing an element with value m is:\n        If there are multiple m's: then the new min is still m (so the instability is M - m, same as original)\n        If there is only one m: then the new min is the next smallest value (let that be x, which is > m). Then the instability becomes M - x.\n\n   Similarly, removing an element with value M:\n        If there are multiple M's: then the new max is still M (so the instability is M - m, same as original)\n        If there is only one M: then the new max is the previous largest value (let that be y, which is < M). Then the instability becomes y - m.\n\n   But wait, we are allowed to remove only one element. And we want the minimum instability.\n\n   However, note: we can also remove an element that is neither m nor M, but then the min and max remain unchanged. So the instability remains M-m.\n\n   Therefore, the candidate instabilities are:\n\n        candidate1: M - m   (if we remove an element that is not m and not M, then instability remains the same)\n        candidate2: M - m   (if we remove an element that is m and there are duplicates of m, then instability remains the same)\n        candidate3: M - m   (if we remove an element that is M and there are duplicates of M, then instability remains the same)\n\n        candidate4: (M - the next distinct min if we remove the last occurrence of m) \n        candidate5: (the next distinct max - m if we remove the last occurrence of M)\n\n   But note: we don't know the entire set of distinct numbers. However, we can use the sorted array to easily find the next distinct value.\n\n   Actually, we can think of it differently: \n\n        We are going to consider the entire sorted array. We are going to try removing each of the endpoints (the first and the last) and see what the instability becomes.\n\n        Removing the first element (b0): \n            Then the new min is b1 (if n>=2) and the max is b_{n-1}. So instability = b_{n-1} - b1.\n\n        Removing the last element (b_{n-1}):\n            Then the new max is b_{n-2} and the min is b0. So instability = b_{n-2} - b0.\n\n        Now, what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? Then the min and max remain b0 and b_{n-1}, so the instability is b_{n-1}-b0.\n\n        However, note: the problem says we have to remove exactly one element. And we are free to choose which one.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the minimum among:\n            (b_{n-1} - b0)   [removing an arbitrary element that is not the min or max, or if there are duplicates then even removing the min or max might leave the min/max unchanged? Actually, no: because if we remove an element that is the min but there are duplicates, then the min remains, so the instability is the same as the original. Similarly for max.\n\n        But wait: the original instability is b_{n-1}-b0. \n\n        Actually, we have two candidates that can potentially reduce the instability:\n\n            candidate_remove_first = b_{n-1} - b1\n            candidate_remove_last = b_{n-2} - b0\n\n        And the original candidate (if we remove an element that is not the min or max, or if we remove an element that is the min but there are duplicates, then the instability remains b_{n-1}-b0).\n\n        However, note: if we remove the first element, then the instability becomes b_{n-1} - b1. This might be lower than the original? Only if b1 > b0 (which it is) and b_{n-1} - b1 < b_{n-1} - b0, which is true because b1 > b0.\n\n        Similarly, candidate_remove_last might be lower.\n\n        But what if the array has duplicates? \n\n        Example: [1,1,2,3,4] \n            Original instability: 4-1=3.\n            Candidate_remove_first: remove the first 1 -> [1,2,3,4] -> instability=4-1=3.\n            Candidate_remove_last: remove the last 4 -> [1,1,2,3] -> instability=3-1=2.\n\n        Another example: [1,2,3,4,4]\n            Candidate_remove_first: remove 1 -> [2,3,4,4] -> instability=4-2=2.\n            Candidate_remove_last: remove the last 4 -> [1,2,3,4] -> instability=4-1=3.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider both candidates and the possibility that removing the min might not change the min (if duplicates) so we cannot rely solely on the endpoints.\n\n        Actually, the key is: we are allowed to remove one element. The goal is to minimize the difference between the max and min of the remaining array.\n\n        How can we achieve that?\n\n        Note: The instability is determined by the smallest and largest elements remaining.\n\n        We can consider: the resulting array's min and max must come from the original array. The best way to reduce the instability is to remove one of the extremes (min or max) that is unique. \n\n        However, we can also consider the possibility of having the same min or max if duplicates exist.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let b = sorted(a)\n\n            candidate1 = b[-1] - b[1]   # remove the first element (the smallest) and then the new min is b[1]\n            candidate2 = b[-2] - b[0]    # remove the last element (the largest) and then the new max is b[-2]\n\n            But wait, what if we remove an element that is the first element, but the first element is duplicated? Then the min remains the same. In that case, candidate1 is not beneficial.\n\n            However, note: if we remove the first element, then the new array's min is the next element (b[1]), regardless of whether there are duplicates. So even if the first element is duplicated, removing one occurrence of the min doesn't change the min? Actually, no: because if we remove one occurrence, and there is another occurrence, then the min remains the first element. \n\n            So if we remove an element that is the min, but there is still a min in the array, then the min doesn't change. Similarly for the max.\n\n            Therefore, the only time removing the min changes the min is when we remove the last (and only) min. Similarly for max.\n\n        So we need to consider:\n\n            If we remove an element that is the global min, then the new min is the next smallest distinct value? Actually, no: the next smallest value in the array. But note: if there are duplicates, then the min doesn't change.\n\n        Actually, the min of the array after removal is the smallest value that is present. So if we remove one occurrence of the min and there are other occurrences, then the min remains the same.\n\n        Therefore, the instability after removing the min (if there are duplicates) is still the same as the original.\n\n        So the candidate for removing an element that is the min is:\n\n            If there is only one occurrence of the min, then the new min is the next smallest value (which is the second smallest in the sorted array, but note: there might be duplicates of the next smallest). Actually, the next smallest value is the first value in the sorted array that is greater than the min.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n            candidate_remove_min = (if the array has more than one min) then instability remains the same? Not necessarily: because if we remove one min, then the min might still be the same, but the max might be reduced if we also remove the max? No, we are removing one element.\n\n        Actually, we can break down:\n\n            Let m = min(a), M = max(a)\n\n            If we remove an element that is m, then the new min is:\n                if count(m) > 1: then m (because there's still at least one m)\n                else: the next value in the sorted array (which is the first value greater than m)\n\n            Similarly, if we remove an element that is M, then the new max is:\n                if count(M) > 1: then M\n                else: the last value in the sorted array that is less than M.\n\n        But note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We are not forced to remove a min or max. However, removing an element that is not the min or max leaves the min and max unchanged, so the instability is M - m.\n\n        So the minimal instability we can get is the minimum among:\n\n            candidate1 = M - m   (if we remove an element that is not the min or max, or if we remove an element that is the min or max but there are duplicates, then the instability remains M-m)\n\n            candidate2 = (if we remove the last occurrence of the min and there isn't one) then the new min is the next value, so instability = M - (next_min) \n            candidate3 = (if we remove the last occurrence of the max) then the new max is the previous value, so instability = (next_max) - m\n\n        However, we don't know the counts of min and max. We can precompute:\n\n            Let b = sorted(a)\n\n            candidate1 = b[-1] - b[0]   # the original instability\n\n            candidate2 = b[-1] - b[1]    # removing the first occurrence (which is the min) and if there are duplicates, then the min remains so candidate2 might be the same as candidate1? Actually no: if we remove the first element, the min becomes b[1] (if the first element was the only min) then the instability becomes b[-1]-b[1]. But if there are duplicates, then the min remains b[0], so the instability is the same as candidate1.\n\n            Similarly, candidate3 = b[-2] - b[0]   # removing the last element (which is the max) and if there are duplicates, the max remains so the instability is the same as candidate1.\n\n        But wait, how do we know if the first element is the only min? We can check the next element. If the first element equals the second, then there are duplicates. Then removing the first element leaves the min as b[0]. Otherwise, if the first element is less than the second, then removing the first element changes the min to b[1].\n\n        Similarly, for the last element: if the last element is greater than the second last, then removing the last element changes the max to b[-2]; otherwise, if the last element is equal to the second last, then removing the last element leaves the max as the same.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We don't necessarily have to remove the first or last. But the best improvement can only come from removing one of the endpoints (the min or the max) because if we remove an element that is not the min or max, the min and max don't change. And if we remove the min (and it's not unique) then the min doesn't change, similarly for the max.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n            candidate1: b[-1] - b[0]   [this is the original, and we don't get better by removing non-endpoint or duplicate endpoints?]\n\n            candidate2: if the first element is the only min, then b[-1] - b[1] \n            candidate3: if the last element is the only max, then b[-2] - b[0]\n\n        But note: we can remove an element that is the min (even if it's not the first occurrence) and if the min is duplicated, then the instability remains the same. Similarly for max.\n\n        However, we can also consider: what if we remove an element that is the min and there are duplicates, then the instability remains the same. So we don't get a candidate from that removal.\n\n        Therefore, the candidates we get are:\n\n            candidate1 = b[-1] - b[0]   [this is always one candidate, by removing an element that is not the min or max, or by removing a duplicate min or max]\n\n            candidate2 = (if we remove the first element and the first element is the only min) then b[-1] - b[1]\n            candidate3 = (if we remove the last element and the last element is the only max) then b[-2] - b[0]\n\n        But wait, we are allowed to remove any element. We don't have to remove the first or last element. However, if we remove an element that is the min (but not the first occurrence) then the min remains the same, so the instability is the same as candidate1. Similarly, if we remove an element that is the max (but not the last occurrence) then the instability remains the same.\n\n        Therefore, the only chance to improve the instability is by removing the first element (if it is the only min) or the last element (if it is the only max).\n\n        However, what if we remove an element that is the min but not the first occurrence? Then the min doesn't change, so the instability remains the same. Similarly for max.\n\n        So the minimal instability is:\n\n            min( candidate1, candidate2 (if applicable), candidate3 (if applicable) )\n\n        But note: candidate1 is the original instability, and candidate2 and candidate3 are improvements if they are smaller.\n\n        Example: [1,2,3,4] \n            candidate1 = 4-1=3\n            candidate2: remove first element: [2,3,4] -> 4-2=2 -> candidate2=2\n            candidate3: remove last element: [1,2,3] -> 3-1=2 -> candidate3=2\n            Then answer = min(3,2,2)=2.\n\n        Example: [1,1,2,3] \n            candidate1 = 3-1=2\n            candidate2: remove first element: [1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> 2 (same as candidate1) -> candidate2=2\n            candidate3: remove last element: [1,1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> 1 -> candidate3=1\n            Then answer = min(2,2,1)=1.\n\n        But wait, in [1,1,2,3]:\n            Removing the last element (3) gives [1,1,2] -> instability = 2-1=1.\n            Removing the first element (1) gives [1,2,3] -> instability = 3-1=2.\n\n        So the candidate3 is applicable because the last element (3) is the only max (since there's only one 3). \n\n        How do we check for \"only min\" or \"only max\"?\n\n            For the first element: \n                It is the only min if the first element is strictly less than the second element (i.e., b[0] < b[1])\n\n            Similarly, for the last element:\n                It is the only max if the last element is strictly greater than the second last element (i.e., b[-1] > b[-2])\n\n        However, what if the array has more than two elements? \n\n        Example: [1,1,2,3,3] \n            candidate1 = 3-1=2\n            candidate2: remove first element -> [1,2,3,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> 2 (same as candidate1) -> candidate2=2\n            candidate3: remove last element -> [1,1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> 2 (same as candidate1) -> candidate3=2\n            Then answer=2.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove the last occurrence of the max? Then the max becomes 3 (still) because there are two 3's. Similarly, if we remove the first occurrence of the min, the min remains 1.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            candidate2 = None\n            candidate3 = None\n\n            If b[0] < b[1]:\n                candidate2 = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n            If b[-1] > b[-2]:\n                candidate3 = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n            Then answer = min(candidate1, candidate2 if candidate2 exists else float('inf'), candidate3 if candidate3 exists else float('inf'))\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to remove any element. What if we remove an element that is neither the first nor the last? Then the instability remains candidate1. \n\n        But wait: candidate1 is the original instability. \n\n        Let me test with [1,1,2,3,3]:\n\n            candidate1 = 3-1 = 2.\n\n            candidate2: condition: b[0]=1 < b[1]=1 -> False, so candidate2 not considered.\n            candidate3: condition: b[-1]=3 > b[-2]=3 -> False, so candidate3 not considered.\n\n            Then answer = min(2, inf, inf) = 2.\n\n        But what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? For example, remove the 2. Then the array becomes [1,1,3,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2. Same as candidate1.\n\n        Therefore, our method works.\n\n        However, consider an array with more than two distinct values.\n\n        Example: [1,2,4,5,6] \n            candidate1 = 6-1=5\n            candidate2: remove first element: [2,4,5,6] -> 6-2=4\n            candidate3: remove last element: [1,2,4,5] -> 5-1=4\n            Then answer=4.\n\n        But wait, is there a better candidate? What if we remove the 4? Then the array becomes [1,2,5,6] -> instability=6-1=5, same as candidate1.\n\n        So the minimal instability is 4.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            b = sorted(a)\n            candidate1 = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n            candidate2 = float('inf')\n            candidate3 = float('inf')\n\n            if n >= 2:\n                if b[0] < b[1]:\n                    candidate2 = b[-1] - b[1]\n                if b[-1] > b[-2]:\n                    candidate3 = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n            answer = min(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n        However, note: we must consider that the array has at least 2 elements (given n>=2). \n\n        But wait, what if we have two elements? [1,2]\n            candidate1 = 2-1=1\n            candidate2: condition: 1<2 -> True, so candidate2 = 2-2=0? \n                Actually, after removing the first element (1) from [1,2] we get [2] -> but wait, the problem says the array has n-1 elements. For n=2, removing one element leaves one element. The instability of a single element array is 0 (max-min of one element is 0).\n            Similarly, candidate3: condition: 2>1 -> True, candidate3 = 1-1=0.\n\n            Then answer = min(1,0,0)=0.\n\n        That matches.\n\n        However, note: when n==2, the sorted array is [x,y]. Then:\n            candidate1 = y-x.\n            candidate2 = y - y (if we remove the first element, then the array becomes [y] -> instability 0) -> but wait, our candidate2 calculation: \n                candidate2 = b[-1] - b[1] = y - y = 0? But wait, in the two-element array, the second element is y. So yes.\n\n        But wait, our condition for candidate2: \n            We said: if the first element is strictly less than the second, then candidate2 = b[-1] - b[1].\n            For [1,2]: candidate2 = 2 - 2 = 0.\n\n        Similarly, candidate3 = b[-2] - b[0] = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\n        So the code works.\n\n        However, what if the array is [1,2,3]?\n            candidate1 = 3-1=2\n            candidate2: condition: 1<2 -> True, candidate2 = 3-2=1\n            candidate3: condition: 3>2 -> True, candidate3 = 2-1=1\n            answer = min(2,1,1)=1.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the array is [1,2,2,3]?\n            candidate1 = 3-1=2\n            candidate2: condition: 1<2 -> True, candidate2 = 3-2=1\n            candidate3: condition: 3>2 -> True, candidate3 = 2-1=1\n            answer=1.\n\n        However, let's verify by removing the first element (1): [2,2,3] -> instability=3-2=1 -> correct.\n        Removing the last element (3): [1,2,2] -> instability=2-1=1 -> correct.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            b = sorted(a)\n            candidate1 = b[-1] - b[0]\n            candidate2 = float('inf')\n            candidate3 = float('inf')\n\n            if n >= 2:\n                if b[0] < b[1]:\n                    candidate2 = b[-1] - b[1]\n                if b[-1] > b[-2]:\n                    candidate3 = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n            ans = min(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n            print(ans)\n\n        However, note: the problem says the array has at least 2 elements, so n>=2, so we don't need to check for n>=2 separately? Actually, the input constraint is n>=2.\n\n        But wait: the above code uses b[-1] and b[-2] which is safe for n>=2. \n\n        However, let's test with n=2: [1,2] -> works.\n\n        But wait, what if the array has two identical elements? [2,2]\n            candidate1 = 2-2=0\n            candidate2: condition: 2<2 -> False, so candidate2 remains inf\n            candidate3: condition: 2>2 -> False, so candidate3 remains inf\n            then ans = 0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Another test: [1,1,1,1] (all same)\n            candidate1 = 1-1=0\n            candidate2: condition: 1<1 -> False -> inf\n            candidate3: condition: 1>1 -> False -> inf\n            ans=0.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But wait, is this sufficient? Consider an array with three elements: [1,3,4] \n            candidate1 = 4-1=3\n            candidate2: condition: 1<3 -> True, candidate2 = 4-3=1\n            candidate3: condition: 4>3 -> True, candidate3 = 3-1=2\n            Then answer = min(3,1,2)=1.\n\n        Is that correct? \n            Removing the first element (1): [3,4] -> instability=4-3=1 -> correct.\n            Removing the last element (4): [1,3] -> instability=3-1=2 -> so candidate3 is 2, but candidate2 is better.\n\n        So the answer is 1.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to remove any one element. The above considers only removing the first element (which is the min) and the last element (which is the max). But what if we remove the middle element (3)? Then the array becomes [1,4] -> instability=4-1=3, which is worse.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability is 1.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        But wait, what if the array is [1,4,5]?\n            candidate1 = 5-1=4\n            candidate2: 1<4 -> True, candidate2=5-4=1\n            candidate3: 5>4 -> True, candidate3=4-1=3\n            answer=1.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        However, note: we are only considering two removals: the first element and the last element. But what if the array has more than two distinct values and the min and max are not at the ends? \n\n        Example: [1,2,10,11] \n            candidate1 = 11-1=10\n            candidate2: remove first element (1): [2,10,11] -> instability=11-2=9\n            candidate3: remove last element (11): [1,2,10] -> instability=10-1=9\n            Then answer=9.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove the 2? Then the array becomes [1,10,11] -> instability=11-1=10 -> same as candidate1.\n        What if we remove the 10? Then the array becomes [1,2,11] -> instability=11-1=10.\n\n        So the minimal is 9.\n\n        However, note: the above code uses the condition for candidate2 and candidate3 based on the sorted array. In the sorted array [1,2,10,11]:\n\n            candidate2: condition: 1<2 -> True, candidate2 = 11-2=9.\n            candidate3: condition: 11>10 -> True, candidate3 = 10-1=9.\n\n        So it returns 9.\n\n        But wait, why did we use the second element for candidate2? Because we are removing the first element (the min) and then the new min is the second element (which is the next smallest). Similarly, for candidate3 we remove the last element and the new max is the second last.\n\n        This holds because the array is sorted. \n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            b = sorted(a)\n            candidate1 = b[-1] - b[0]\n            candidate2 = float('inf')\n            candidate3 = float('inf')\n\n            # Since n>=2, we can safely access b[1] and b[-2]\n            if b[0] < b[1]:\n                candidate2 = b[-1] - b[1]\n            if b[-1] > b[-2]:\n                candidate3 = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n            ans = min(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n            print(ans)\n\n        Let me run through the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: ['4\\n1 3 3 7']\n                n=4, a=[1,3,3,7] -> sorted=[1,3,3,7]\n                candidate1 = 7-1=6\n                candidate2: 1<3 -> True, candidate2=7-3=4\n                candidate3: 7>3 -> True, candidate3=3-1=2\n                ans=min(6,4,2)=2 -> correct.\n\n            Example 2: ['2\\n1 100000']\n                n=2, a=[1,100000] -> sorted=[1,100000]\n                candidate1=100000-1=99999\n                candidate2: 1<100000 -> True, candidate2=100000-100000=0\n                candidate3: 100000>1 -> True, candidate3=1-1=0\n                ans=0 -> correct.\n\n        However, wait: in example2, candidate3: condition is b[-1]>b[-2] -> 100000>1 -> True, then candidate3 = b[-2]-b[0] = 1-1=0.\n\n        But note: in the two-element array, the array is [1,100000]. Removing the last element (100000) leaves [1] -> instability=0. Correct.\n\n        But wait, in the two-element array, the first element is 1 and the second is 100000. When we remove the first element, we get [100000] -> instability=0. When we remove the last element, we get [1] -> instability=0.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: the above code does not consider the possibility of removing an element that is not the first or last. But we already reasoned that removing an element that is not the min or max leaves the min and max unchanged, so the instability is candidate1. And if we remove the min (and it's duplicated) then the instability is candidate1. Similarly for max.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min but not the first occurrence? Then the min doesn't change, so the instability is candidate1. Similarly for max.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between candidate1 and the two improved candidates (if applicable). \n\n        However, note that candidate2 and candidate3 are improvements only when the condition holds (i.e., when the min or max is unique). \n\n        But wait, what if the array has more than two elements and the min is duplicated? Then candidate2 is not applicable, and candidate1 is the same as if we remove any element (including a duplicate min). Similarly for max.\n\n        So the code is complete.\n\n        One more example: [1,2,2,3] (already tested) -> candidate1=2, candidate2=3-2=1, candidate3=2-1=1 -> answer=1.\n\n        But wait, in [1,2,2,3], the min is 1 (unique) and the max is 3 (unique). So conditions hold.\n\n        Example: [1,2,2,3,3] \n            candidate1=3-1=2\n            candidate2: 1<2 -> True, candidate2=3-2=1\n            candidate3: 3>3 -> False, candidate3=inf\n            Then answer=1.\n\n        Correct: remove the first element (1) -> [2,2,3,3] -> instability=3-2=1.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code.\n\n        However, note: the condition for candidate2 is that the first element is strictly less than the second. This works because if the first element is duplicated, then the second element is equal to the first, so the condition fails.\n\n        Similarly, for candidate3",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the minimal instability can be achieved by either removing the smallest or the largest element from the array. Removing any other element will not change the min or max values, hence leaving the instability unchanged. \n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the smallest and largest elements. The minimal instability will be the smaller value between:\n   - The original instability (if we remove a non-extreme element or a duplicate extreme).\n   - The instability after removing the smallest element (if it is unique), which becomes the difference between the largest element and the next smallest element.\n   - The instability after removing the largest element (if it is unique), which becomes the difference between the next largest element and the smallest element.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves sorting the array and then evaluating the three possible candidates for minimal instability as described above. The solution efficiently checks these candidates to determine the minimal instability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = sorted(a)\ncandidate1 = b[-1] - b[0]\ncandidate2 = float('inf')\ncandidate3 = float('inf')\n\nif b[0] < b[1]:\n    candidate2 = b[-1] - b[1]\nif b[-1] > b[-2]:\n    candidate3 = b[-2] - b[0]\n\nans = min(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array `a` is sorted to easily access the smallest (`b[0]`) and largest (`b[-1]`) elements.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**: \n   - **Candidate1** is the original instability, which remains if we remove a non-extreme element or a duplicate extreme.\n   - **Candidate2** is the instability after removing the smallest element (if it is unique), calculated as the difference between the largest element and the next smallest element (`b[1]`).\n   - **Candidate3** is the instability after removing the largest element (if it is unique), calculated as the difference between the next largest element (`b[-2]`) and the smallest element.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimal value among the three candidates is printed as the result, representing the smallest possible instability achievable by removing one element from the array. This approach efficiently narrows down the solution to checking only the relevant cases, leveraging sorting for simplicity and correctness.",
