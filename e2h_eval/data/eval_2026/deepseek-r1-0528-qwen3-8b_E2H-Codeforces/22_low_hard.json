After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and m.\n Then, we read the next n lines, each containing a string of m digits.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We need to know for each subject, what is the maximum mark? (since best means highest mark)\n 2. However, note: there might be multiple students with the same highest mark in a subject. But the problem says: \n    \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark\". So if two students have the same highest mark, then they are both considered best in that subject.\n\n 3. For a student to be successful, he must be the best in at least one subject.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   - Let's create a list `max_marks` for each subject (each column) which is the maximum digit in that column (converted to integer or just compare as char since '9'>'1').\n   - Then, for each student, check for any subject j: if his mark (at j-th column) is equal to `max_marks[j]`? Then he is best in that subject.\n\n But note: the input is given as a list of strings for each student.\n\n However, we can do:\n\n   Read n and m from first line.\n   Then, read the next n lines.\n\n   We'll have a list of strings: [s0, s1, ..., s_{n-1}], each string has length m.\n\n   For each subject j (0-indexed), we want the maximum character in the j-th column.\n\n   Then, for each student i, we look at all subjects j: if the character at s[i][j] is equal to max_marks[j], then this student is best in subject j.\n\n   But note: the condition is not only being equal to the maximum, but also note that the maximum is defined by the entire class.\n\n   However, if the maximum in the subject is '5', then any student having '5' is best.\n\n   Then, we can mark a student as successful if in at least one subject j, s[i][j] == max_marks[j].\n\n 4. We then count the number of students that have at least one such subject.\n\n Example: \n     Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n     For subject0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n     For subject1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n     For subject2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n     Now, check each student:\n        Student0: \"223\" -> subject0: '2' == max0 ('2') -> True; subject1: '2' != '3'; subject2: '3' == '3' -> True. Since at least one is True, student0 is successful.\n        Student1: \"232\" -> subject0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful.\n        Student2: \"112\" -> subject0: '1' != '2'; subject1: '1' != '3'; subject2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n     So output is 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Parse first line to get n and m.\n   Step 2: Read the next n lines.\n\n   Step 3: For each j in range(m):\n        column_j = [row[j] for row in list_of_rows]\n        max_char = max(column_j)\n\n   Step 4: For each student i:\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if row[i][j] == max_char_per_subject[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        Then, if successful, count++.\n\n   However, note: the input example is given as a string of digits. We are comparing characters. Since the marks are single digits, comparing characters is the same as comparing integers for the purpose of max (because '9' > '8' etc.).\n\n   But note: we are reading the input as string.\n\n   Example: \n        Input: \"3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111\"\n\n   Let's break down the second sample:\n\n        n=3, m=5\n        Rows: \n            row0 = \"91728\"\n            row1 = \"11828\"\n            row2 = \"11111\"\n\n        For each subject j (0 to 4):\n\n        j0: ['9','1','1'] -> max is '9'\n        j1: ['1','1','1'] -> max is '1'\n        j2: ['7','8','1'] -> max is '8'\n        j3: ['2','2','",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of a student across all subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest mark achieved by any student. This involves examining each column (subject) of the gradebook and identifying the maximum character in that column.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are marked as successful. The count of such students is the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    gradebook = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        gradebook.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_marks_per_subject = [max([gradebook[j][i] for j in range(n)]) for i in range(m)]\n    \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        successful = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks_per_subject[j]:\n                successful = True\n                break\n        if successful:\n            count_successful += 1\n            \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads all input lines at once and splits them into a list. The first line is processed to extract the number of students (n) and subjects (m). Subsequent lines are read as the gradebook entries.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the code checks all student entries (rows) to find the highest mark. This is done using a list comprehension that gathers all marks for a subject and applies the `max` function.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, the code checks if their mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject. If it does, the student is counted as successful. The loop breaks early if a match is found to optimize performance.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input, checks each student's performance against the highest marks in each subject, and counts those who excel in at least one subject. The solution handles edge cases such as empty input or single-student scenarios gracefully.",
