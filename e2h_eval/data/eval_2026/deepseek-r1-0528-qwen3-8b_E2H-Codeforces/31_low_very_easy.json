Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer from -x to x (excluding 0? Actually including 0? But note: the problem says \"each card doesn't exceed x in absolute value\", so numbers from -x to x are allowed, including zero.\n\n However, note: the problem says Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So we can use any integer in that range arbitrarily many times.\n\n We are to find the minimum number of cards to add such that the total sum is zero.\n\n Let S be the sum of the found cards.\n Then, we need to form a sum of T = -S with some set of cards (each card's absolute value <= x) and we want the minimum number of cards.\n\n This is similar to the classic coin change problem but with the following:\n   - We have coins (available numbers) from -x to x (but note: we cannot use 0 because then we wouldn't change the sum? Actually 0 is allowed, but using 0 doesn't help. So we can consider only non-zero if we want minimal, but wait: maybe 0 is not useful for making up the deficit. However, the problem allows 0, but since we are minimizing the number of cards, we would never use 0 because it doesn't change the sum.\n\n Alternatively, note that we can use positive and negative numbers. The goal is to cover the deficit (which could be positive or negative) with as few cards as possible, where each card can be at most x (in absolute value).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n and x, then the list of n integers.\n 2. Compute the current sum S of the found cards. Then the target is T = -S.\n\n 3. If T == 0, then we don't need any card -> answer 0.\n\n 4. Otherwise, we are allowed to use any integer in the range [-x, x] (except 0? Actually, we can use 0 but it doesn't help. So we can consider only the non-zero values). However, note that we are allowed to use the same card multiple times.\n\n 5. We wish to minimize the number of cards (k) such that there exists k integers a1, a2, ... ak (each |ai| <= x) with sum = T.\n\n Observation: \n   - The maximum absolute value of a card is x. Therefore, the maximum positive contribution per card is x, and similarly negative is -x.\n\n   - Since we can choose any integer in [-x, x], we can think of the problem as: what is the minimum number of terms (each term being between -x and x) to achieve the sum T?\n\n   - Note: We are allowed to use both positive and negative. However, we can break the problem into two parts: the sign of T.\n\n   - Alternatively, note that the problem is symmetric. Without loss of generality, assume T is positive (if T is negative, we can consider the absolute value and then use negative cards). But wait, we can also use negative cards to get a positive T? Actually, no: negative cards decrease the sum. However, we can mix positive and negative? Actually, no: if we want to get a positive T, we must have more positive contributions than negative. But note: we are allowed to use any combination.\n\n   However, let me reframe: We want to achieve T (which might be positive or negative). The minimal number of cards needed is at least ceil(|T| / x) if we were allowed to use only one sign? But wait: we can use both positive and negative to adjust the sum arbitrarily? Actually, no: the condition is that the absolute value of each card is at most x.\n\n   But note: we can use negative cards to get a positive T? Let me think: if we want to get a positive T, we can use positive cards. Similarly, for negative T, we use negative cards. However, what if T is positive? Then we can use positive cards (each at most x) and negative cards (each at least -x) to get T. But actually, the minimal number of cards is determined by the fact that we can overshoot and then correct? \n\n   However, the problem is simpler: we can use the same card multiple times and we have all integers from -x to x. So the question becomes: what is the minimum number of cards to represent T (a fixed integer) as the sum of k integers each in [-x, x]?\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. So we are effectively allowed to use any integer step of size between -x and x. This is similar to a coin change problem with coins of denominations from -x to x (excluding",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all his cards equals zero. The solution involves calculating the current sum of the found cards and then figuring out the smallest number of cards required to balance this sum to zero using cards with values between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards. This sum, `S`, must be balanced to zero by adding more cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum, `T`, is the negative of `S` (i.e., `T = -S`). If `T` is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If `T` is zero, the answer is zero because the current sum is already balanced.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For a non-zero `T`, the minimal number of cards required is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of `T` divided by `x`. This is because each card can contribute at most `x` towards balancing the sum. For example, if `T` is 5 and `x` is 3, the minimal number of cards needed is ceil(5/3) = 2 (since 3 + 3 = 6, which covers the deficit).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total = sum(cards)\n    target = -total\n    \n    if target == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    abs_target = abs(target)\n    num_cards = (abs_target + x - 1) // x\n    \n    print(num_cards)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of found cards `n`, the maximum absolute value `x`, and the list of integers on these cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum to balance this is the negative of this sum.\n3. **Zero Check**: If the target sum is zero, the result is immediately zero since no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Card Calculation**: For a non-zero target, the minimal number of cards is calculated by taking the absolute value of the target, dividing it by `x` (the maximum contribution per card), and rounding up to the nearest integer. This gives the smallest number of cards required to reach the target sum.\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the minimal number of cards needed to balance the sum to zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
