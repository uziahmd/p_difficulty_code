Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero length border. This means that we can cross a road to go to an adjacent block.\n\n The key observation is that each road is a line, and being on one side or the other of a line defines a half-plane. The entire plane is divided by the n lines. The movement between blocks is essentially crossing one or more lines. However, note that moving from home to university requires crossing some set of lines. But the problem says we can only move to an adjacent block (sharing a border) in one step. This implies that we can only cross one line at a time? Actually, note: the common border must have nonzero length. Two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one line (so they share a segment of that line). But note: two blocks might be separated by multiple lines, but you cannot cross all of them in one step because the common border must be a single contiguous segment (which is defined by one line).\n\n However, here's an important insight: the minimum number of steps required to get from home to university is the number of roads that separate home and university. But wait: not exactly. Because if you cross a road, you change the side. Each road divides the plane into two. The home and university lie in two different half-planes for some roads and the same for others.\n\n Actually, consider: \n   For each road i, we can check which side of the road the home is on and which side the university is on.\n   If they are on opposite sides, then to go from home to university, you must cross that road at least once.\n\n However, note that you can cross multiple roads in multiple steps. But the problem states that in one step you can move from one block to an adjacent one (i.e., crossing one road). Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n But wait: is that always the case? Consider that when you cross one road, you are now in a new block. Then to cross another road, you have to do it in another step. However, sometimes you might cross several roads at the same time (if they all meet at an intersection) but that doesn't help because the problem says you can only move to a block that shares a nonzero border, meaning you can only cross one road per step.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require that we cross the roads in a linear fashion. But the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points? Actually, no: because sometimes a road might separate both points (so they are on the same side) and then we don't need to cross it. So we count the roads for which the two points are on opposite sides.\n\n But is that the answer? Let me check with the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        1 1\n        -1 -1\n        2\n        0 1 0\n        1 0 0\n\n   These two lines: \n        Line1: y = 0 (x-axis)\n        Line2: x = 0 (y-axis)\n\n   Home (1,1): above the x-axis and right of the y-axis.\n   University (-1,-1): below the x-axis and left of the y-axis.\n\n   So they are separated by both roads. Therefore, we need to cross both. But how?\n\n   Step 1: cross one road, say the x-axis (from (1,1) to (-1,1)) but wait, that would be going from home to a point above the x-axis to a point below? Actually, we can choose the order. However, note: the movement is from one block to another. The two blocks adjacent to the x-axis are the upper and lower half-planes. Similarly for the y-axis.\n\n   But note: the two points are separated by two roads. However, the minimal steps is 2.\n\n   Example 2:\n        Input:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n   The third road is x+y=3. Let's check the separation:\n\n        Road1: x=0 -> home (1,1) is to the right (positive), university (-1,-1) is to the left (negative).\n        Road2: y=0 -> home (1,1) is above, university (-1,-1) is below.\n        Road3: x+y=3 -> for home: 1+1=2 < 3 -> one side; university: -1-1=-2 < 3 -> same side.\n\n   So we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates two adjacent blocks. The key insight is that each road that separates the home and university points must be crossed exactly once, and the minimal number of steps is simply the count of such roads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home and university blocks. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. If the home and university lie on opposite sides of a road, then crossing that road is necessary to move between them.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, check whether the home and university lie on the same side or opposite sides. If they lie on opposite sides, crossing that road is mandatory, and thus it contributes to the minimal number of steps.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road defined by the equation \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\\), compute the sign of the expression \\(a_i x + b_i y + c_i\\) for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, the road separates the two points, and we increment our step count.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the \\(n\\) roads once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), which is efficient given the constraint \\(n \\leq 300\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    x1 = int(data[0])\n    y1 = int(data[1])\n    x2 = int(data[2])\n    y2 = int(data[3])\n    \n    n = int(data[4])\n    roads = []\n    index = 5\n    for i in range(n):\n        a = int(data[index])\n        b = int(data[index+1])\n        c = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        \n    steps = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n            steps += 1\n            \n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first four values are the coordinates of the home and university. The next value is the number of roads, followed by the coefficients defining each road.\n2. **Processing Roads**: For each road, the code checks the side of the line where the home and university lie by evaluating the line equation at both points. If the evaluations yield opposite signs, the road separates the two points, and the step count is incremented.\n3. **Output Result**: The total count of such separating roads is printed, which represents the minimal number of steps needed to reach the university from home by crossing one road per step.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages geometric properties of lines and point positions to determine the solution with optimal performance.",
