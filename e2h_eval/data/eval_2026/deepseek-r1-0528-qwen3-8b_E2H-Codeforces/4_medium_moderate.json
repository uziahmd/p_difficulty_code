The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n (number of rounds), string A (Nikephoros's sequence) and string B (Polycarpus's sequence)\n Since n can be up to 2e9, we cannot simulate round by round.\n\n Instead, we can consider the periodicity of the sequences. Let:\n   m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n The i-th move for Nikephoros is determined by index: (i-1) % m (if we index from 0)\n The j-th move for Polycarpus is determined by index: (j-1) % k\n\n But note: the game has n rounds. So we have two sequences that cycle independently.\n\n We can break the n rounds into complete cycles of both sequences? Actually, we need to consider the entire set of rounds.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the entire round as a pair (a_i, b_j) where i from 0 to n-1 and j from 0 to n-1.\n But note: the moves are determined by the round index. In round i (0-indexed):\n   Nikephoros uses A[i % m]\n   Polycarpus uses B[i % k]\n\n So we are effectively looking at the pairs (A[i % m], B[i % k]) for i in [0, n-1].\n\n However, note that the same pair (a, b) might repeat periodically with period LCM(m, k). But note that m and k are at most 1000, so LCM(m,k) could be up to 10^6, which is acceptable if we do one full cycle and then multiply by the number of cycles? But n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot iterate over all rounds.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Count the total number of losses for each player over one full period (with period T = LCM(m, k)), then multiply by the number of complete periods, and then handle the remainder.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Note: LCM(m, k) = m * k // GCD(m, k). But note: we don't need to know the LCM per se; we can also use the fact that the state (i mod m, j mod k) repeats every T = LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\n 2. We can precompute for each possible (i, j) (where i in [0, m-1] and j in [0, k-1]) the outcome of the round (who loses or if draw). But note: we are only concerned with who loses (and count losses).\n\n    There are three outcomes for a round (given two moves x and y):\n\n      - Draw: when x == y -> no loss.\n      - Loss for Nikephoros: \n            (x='R', y='P') or (x='R', y='S')? Actually, let me recall the rules:\n\n        Rock beats scissors -> so if you show rock and opponent shows scissors, you win (so opponent loses).\n        Scissors beats paper -> opponent loses if opponent shows paper and you show scissors.\n        Paper beats rock -> opponent loses if opponent shows rock and you show paper.\n\n        So for a round between (Nikephoros, Polycarpus):\n\n          If (a, b) is:\n            ('R','P'): a wins -> no loss for Nikephoros, but Polycarpus loses.\n            ('R','S'): a wins -> Polycarpus loses? No, wait: \n                Actually, the rule: \n                  Rock (a) vs Scissors (b): Rock beats Scissors -> so Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses.\n            ('S','R'): Scissors vs Rock: Scissors loses -> so Nikephoros loses.\n            ('S','P'): Scissors vs Paper: Scissors wins -> Polycarpus loses.\n            ('P','R'): Paper vs Rock: Paper wins -> Polycarpus loses.\n            ('P','S'): Paper vs Scissors: Paper loses -> Nikephoros loses.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n\n        Let f(a, b) return:\n          0 if draw\n          1 if Polycarpus loses (so Nikephoros wins)\n          2 if Nikephoros loses (so Polycarpus wins)\n\n        But actually we want to count losses per player.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n\n        For a round (a, b):\n          if a == b: no loss.\n          else if (a, b) is ('R','S') or ('S','P') or ('P','R'):\n              then Nikephoros wins -> Polycarpus loses (count for Polycarpus++)\n          else:\n              then Polycarpus wins -> Nikephoros loses (count for Nikephoros++)\n\n        But wait, let's check:\n\n          ('R','S'): a wins -> Polycarpus loses -> count_P += 1\n          ('R','P'): a loses -> because Rock loses to Paper -> so Nikephoros loses -> count_N += 1\n          ('S','R'): a loses? Scissors vs Rock: Scissors loses (because Rock beats Scissors) -> so Nikephoros loses -> count_N += 1\n          ('S','P'): Scissors vs Paper: Scissors cuts paper -> so Scissors wins (for Nikephoros) -> Polycarpus loses -> count_P += 1\n          ('P','R'): Paper vs Rock: Paper covers rock -> so Paper wins -> Polycarpus loses -> count_P += 1\n          ('P','S'): Paper vs Scissors: Paper loses -> Nikephoros loses -> count_N += 1\n\n        So the losing conditions are:\n          For Polycarpus to lose: \n            (a, b) must be: ('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')\n          For Nikephoros to lose:\n            (a, b) must be: ('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          if a == b: \n             no loss\n          else:\n             if (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                 Polycarpus loses (count_P += 1)\n             else:\n                 Nikephoros loses (count_N += 1)\n\n        But note: the else part is exactly the three cases: ('R','P'), ('S','R'), ('P','S')\n\n 3. Now, we can iterate over all pairs (i, j) for i in range(m) and j in range(k). The total number of distinct (i, j) pairs is m*k, which is up to 10^6. This is acceptable.\n\n 4. Then, the entire sequence of n rounds is equivalent to:\n\n        T = LCM(m, k)   [the period in terms of the combined cycle]\n\n        However, note: the round index i (from 0 to n-1) corresponds to:\n            a_i = A[i % m]\n            b_i = B[i % k]\n\n        And the state (i % m, i % k) repeats every T = LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\n        So, we can compute:\n\n            total_rounds = n\n            period = LCM(m, k)   # T\n\n            cycles = n // period\n            remainder = n % period\n\n        Then, we can compute the total losses for one period (i.e., over T rounds) and then multiply by cycles.\n\n        Then, for the remaining 'remainder' rounds, we simulate from round 0 to round (remainder-1) (each round i, for i from 0 to remainder-1) and add the losses.\n\n 5. Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Read n, A, B.\n\n        Step 2: Compute m = len(A), k = len(B)\n                Compute T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)   [using math.gcd]\n\n        Step 3: Precompute the total losses in one period (T rounds). But note: the period T is the LCM of m and k, meaning that the state (i mod m, i mod k) will cover each combination (x,y) exactly once? \n\n                Actually, the set of states (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to T-1 is the entire set of pairs (x,y) for x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1]. Why?\n\n                Because T is the LCM, so the indices (i mod m, i mod k) will cycle through every residue modulo m and k independently, and since T is the LCM, the pair (i mod m, i mod k) will take on every value (x,y) in [0, m-1] x [0, k-1] exactly once.\n\n                Therefore, we can simply compute:\n\n                    base_count_N = 0   # losses for Nikephoros in one period\n                    base_count_P = 0   # losses for Polycarpus in one period\n\n                    for i in range(m):\n                        for j in range(k):\n                            a_char = A[i]\n                            b_char = B[j]\n                            # Determine the outcome\n                            if a_char == b_char:\n                                continue\n                            elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                                base_count_P += 1\n                            else:\n                                base_count_N += 1\n\n                Then, total losses for the whole game:\n\n                    total_N = base_count_N * (n // T) + (additional losses for the first 'remainder' rounds for Nikephoros)\n                    total_P = base_count_P * (n // T) + (additional losses for the first 'remainder' rounds for Polycarpus)\n\n        Step 4: Now, we need to simulate the first 'remainder' rounds (which is less than T, and T is at most 10^6, so remainder is at most T, which is 10^6, but note T can be up to 10^6, and we have already computed a double loop for T (which is 10^6) for base_count, but wait: our base_count was computed by iterating over m*k (which is at most 10^6) and that is acceptable.\n\n                However, we cannot simulate the first 'remainder' rounds by iterating from 0 to remainder-1 if remainder is large (like 2e9) but note: remainder < T, and T is the LCM(m,k) which is <= m*k <= 10^6, so remainder is at most 10^6, so we can simulate the first 'remainder' rounds by iterating from 0 to remainder-1 (which is up to 10^6) and that is acceptable.\n\n        Alternatively, we can also compute the additional losses for the remainder by iterating over the first 'remainder' rounds. But note: the remainder is the number of rounds left after complete cycles.\n\n        However, note: the state (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to remainder-1 is not necessarily covering every pair, but we can do:\n\n            count_N_rem = 0\n            count_P_rem = 0\n\n            for i in range(remainder):\n                idx_A = i % m\n                idx_B = i % k\n                a_char = A[idx_A]\n                b_char = B[idx_B]\n\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    count_P_rem += 1\n                else:\n                    count_N_rem += 1\n\n        Then:\n\n            total_N = base_count_N * (n // T) + count_N_rem\n            total_P = base_count_P * (n // T) + count_P_rem\n\n 6. But note: wait, is the base_count computed for T rounds? Actually, T is the LCM, and we have m*k = T? Not necessarily, but note that the set of pairs (i mod m, i mod k) for i from 0 to T-1 is exactly the set of all pairs (x,y) for x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] (each appearing exactly once). So base_count_N and base_count_P are the total losses for one entire set of distinct pairs (each pair appears once). \n\n        However, note: the entire set of pairs is m*k, and T (the LCM) is the smallest positive integer such that for every x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1] there exists an i (0<=i<T) with (i mod m, i mod k) = (x,y). And indeed, T = LCM(m,k) and the number of distinct pairs is m*k, so T = LCM(m,k) is the period and it is the same as the number of distinct pairs? \n\n        Actually, the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every LCM(m,k) rounds, and the set of states in one period is exactly the set of all (x,y) with x in [0, m-1] and y in [0, k-1]. So yes, base_count_N and base_count_P are computed from the entire set of pairs (each pair appears once in the period).\n\n        Therefore, the base_count_N and base_count_P are the total losses for a full period.\n\n 7. However, note: the above double loop (m*k) is O(10^6) which is acceptable. But we have to compute the LCM and then use integer division.\n\n 8.

Let's test with the example: \n        Input: \n          7\n          RPS\n          RSPP\n\n        Here, n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        m=3, k=4\n\n        Compute T = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n        Then, cycles = 7//12 = 0, remainder=7.\n\n        We need to simulate 7 rounds.\n\n        Round 0: i=0 -> A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw.\n        Round 1: i=1 -> A[1]='P', B[1]='S' -> ('P','S'): which is in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> wait, ('P','S') is not in that list? \n\n        Correction: our condition for Polycarpus loses is [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. \n\n        So ('P','S') is not in that list. Then we go to the else: which means we check the other condition. Actually, the else condition is the negation: the other three.\n\n        Let's check the rule for ('P','S'): \n            Paper vs Scissors: Paper loses (because Scissors cuts paper) -> so Nikephoros loses.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for Polycarpus loses is when the pair is one of those three. Otherwise, the loss is for Nikephoros.\n\n        So in the example:\n\n          Round 0: (R,R) -> draw.\n          Round 1: (P,S) -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so Nikephoros loses (count_N += 1)\n          Round 2: (S,P) -> ('S','P'): this is in the list [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so Polycarpus loses (count_P += 1)\n          Round 3: (R,P) -> ('R','P'): not in the list -> so Nikephoros loses (count_N += 1)\n          Round 4: (P,R) -> ('P','R'): in the list -> Polycarpus loses (count_P += 1)\n          Round 5: (S,S) -> draw.\n          Round 6: (R,P) -> ('R','P'): not in the list -> Nikephoros loses (count_N += 1)\n\n        Then, total_N = 3, total_P = 2.\n\n        But wait, the example output is \"3 2\", so that matches.\n\n        However, note that in the example the input provided is:\n\n            Input: \n                7\n                RPS\n                RSPP\n\n            Output: \n                3 2\n\n        So our simulation for the remainder (7 rounds) gives 3 for Nikephoros and 2 for Polycarpus.\n\n        But note: the example input in the problem statement is given as:\n\n            ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n        The second sample: \n            Input: \n                5\n                RRRRRRRR\n                R\n\n            Output: \n                0 0\n\n        Let's test with the second sample.\n\n        n=5, A=\"RRRRRRRR\", B=\"R\" (so m=8, k=1)\n\n        T = LCM(8,1)=8.\n\n        base_count_N and base_count_P:\n\n            We iterate over i from 0 to 7 (for A) and j from 0 to 0 (for B) -> so 8 rounds.\n\n            For each i: (A[i]='R', B[0]='R') -> draw.\n\n            So base_count_N = 0, base_count_P = 0.\n\n        Then, cycles = 5 // 8 = 0, remainder = 5.\n\n        Then, simulate 5 rounds:\n\n            Each round: (R,R) -> draw.\n\n            So count_N_rem = 0, count_P_rem = 0.\n\n            Total_N = 0, Total_P = 0.\n\n        So that matches.\n\n 10. However, note: the example input was given as a list of two strings, but the problem says:\n\n        The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.\n        The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters.\n\n     So we read:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A_str = input().strip()\n        B_str = input().strip()\n\n 11. One more example: the sample provided in the problem statement.\n\n 12. Code:\n\n        We use math.gcd? Actually, we defined our own gcd. But to be safe, we can use math.gcd.\n\n        However, the problem constraints are small, so we can use either.\n\n        But note: the problem says the sequences are at most 1000, so T = LCM(m, k) is at most 1000*1000, which is 1e6, and we are iterating over m*k (which is at most 1e6) and then remainder (at most 1e6) so worst-case 2e6 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can avoid using math.gcd if we want, but let's use math.gcd if available.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            import math\n\n        Then:\n\n            T = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n\n 13. Let's code accordingly.\n\n 14. Edge: n=0, but n>=1 per the problem.\n\n 15. Final code:\n\n        import math\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        A = input().strip()\n        B = input().strip()\n\n        m = len(A)\n        k = len(B)\n\n        # Compute LCM of m and k\n        T = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n\n        base_count_N = 0\n        base_count_P = 0\n\n        # Iterate over all pairs (i, j) for the period T (which is the LCM, so we have m*k distinct pairs)\n        for i in range(m):\n            for j in range(k):\n                a_char = A[i]\n                b_char = B[j]\n                if a_char == b_char:\n                    continue\n                # Check for Polycarpus loses: (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n                if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    base_count_P += 1\n                else:\n                    base_count_N += 1\n\n        cycles = n // T\n        remainder = n % T\n\n        # Now, simulate the first 'remainder' rounds\n        count_N_rem = 0\n        count_P_rem = 0\n        for i in range(remainder):\n            idx_A = i % m\n            idx_B = i % k\n            a_char = A[idx_A]\n            b_char = B[idx_B]\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                count_P_rem += 1\n            else:\n                count_N_rem += 1\n\n        total_N = base_count_N * cycles + count_N_rem\n        total_P = base_count_P * cycles + count_P_rem\n\n        print(total_N, total_P)\n\n 16. However, note: the above condition for Polycarpus loses is correct.\n\n 17. Let's run the example again to be sure.\n\n        Example 1: n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        base_count_N and base_count_P for the period T=12:\n\n            We have 12 pairs (m=3, k=4 -> 12 pairs). \n\n            Let's list the pairs:\n\n            i=0: 'R' -> j=0: 'R' -> skip\n            j=1: 'S' -> ('R','S'): in [('R','S'), ...] -> base_count_P +=1\n            j=2: 'P' -> ('R','P'): else -> base_count_N +=1\n            j=3: 'P' -> ('R','P'): same as above -> base_count_N +=1\n\n            i=1: 'P' -> j=0: 'R' -> ('P','R'): in the list -> base_count_P +=1\n            j=1: 'S' -> ('P','S'): not in the list -> base_count_N +=1\n            j=2: 'P' -> ('P','P'): skip\n            j=3: 'P' -> ('P','P'): skip\n\n            i=2: 'S' -> j=0: 'R' -> ('S','R'): not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> base_count_N +=1\n            j=1: 'S' -> ('S','S'): skip\n            j=2: 'P' -> ('S','P'): in the list -> base_count_P +=1\n            j=3: 'P' -> ('S','P'): same as above -> base_count_P +=1\n\n            Now, let's count:\n\n            base_count_N: \n                from i=0,j=2: 1\n                from i=0,j=3: 1 -> so 2\n                from i=1,j=1: 1 -> so 3\n                from i=2,j=0: 1 -> so 4\n\n            base_count_P:\n                from i=0,j=1: 1\n                from i=1,j=0: 1\n                from i=2,j=2: 1\n                from i=2,j=3: 1 -> total 4\n\n            Then, for 7 rounds: cycles = 7//12 = 0, remainder=7.\n\n            Then we simulate 7 rounds (we did above) and got 3 and 2.\n\n            But according to the base counts, in 12 rounds we would have base_count_N=4 and base_count_P=4. \n\n            However, the 7 rounds we simulated are not the first 7 of the 12, but the first 7 of the entire sequence (which is the same as the first 7 of the period). \n\n            Our base_count is for the entire period (12 rounds). But the remainder simulation is independent.\n\n            The simulation for the remainder (7 rounds) gave 3 and 2.\n\n            Why is the base_count_N 4 and base_count_P 4 for 12 rounds? Then in 12 rounds, Nikephoros loses 4 times and Polycarpus loses 4 times.\n\n            But our simulation for 7 rounds (which is part of the period) gave 3 and 2. \n\n            This is consistent because 12 rounds would be 4 and 4, but 7 rounds is not a full period.\n\n            So the base_count is correct.\n\n 18. Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n 19. However, note: the above double loop for base_count is over m*k (which is 12 in the example) and that is acceptable.\n\n 20. But wait: what if m=0 or k=0? The problem states m,k>=1.\n\n 21. We are ready.\n\n 22. Let me try with a small example: n=1, A=\"R\", B=\"S\"\n\n        T = (1*1)//gcd(1,1)=1\n        base_count_N: \n            ('R','S') -> not in [('R','S'), ...] -> wait, ('R','S') is in [('R','S'), ...]? Yes, because ('R','S') is one of the three.\n\n            So base_count_P +=1, base_count_N remains 0.\n\n        Then, cycles = 1//1 = 1, remainder=0.\n\n        So total_N = 0, total_P = 1.\n\n        But the round: \n            A[0]='R', B[0]='S'\n            Rule: Rock vs Scissors -> Rock wins, so Polycarpus loses -> so Polycarpus gets 1 red spot.\n\n        Correct.\n\n 23. Another: n=1, A=\"R\", B=\"P\"\n        ('R','P') -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so base_count_N +=1.\n\n        Then, total_N=1, total_P=0.\n\n 24. Another: n=1, A=\"R\", B=\"R\": draw -> base_count_N=0, base_count_P=0, and remainder=0 -> total_N=0, total_P=0.\n\n 25. It seems correct.\n\n 26. However, note: the example in the problem statement had a sequence of 7 rounds, and we did the simulation for the remainder (7 rounds) by iterating 7 times, which is acceptable because 7 is small.\n\n 27. But if n is very large (like 2e9) and the period T is 10^6, then the remainder is less than T (so at most 10^6) and we iterate at most 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n 28. Therefore, the code below.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players follow specific sequences for their moves, and the challenge is to efficiently compute the result without simulating each round individually, especially since `n` can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players who cyclically use their predefined sequences of moves. Each round's outcome depends on the current moves from both sequences. The key observation is that the sequences repeat periodically, and the combined period is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of both sequences. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one full period and then handling the remaining rounds separately.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each round, the outcome is determined by comparing the current move of Nikephoros (from sequence A) and Polycarpus (from sequence B). If they are the same, it's a draw. Otherwise, one player loses based on the game rules. By analyzing all possible pairs of moves in one full period (LCM of sequence lengths), we can count the total losses each player incurs per period. The total losses for `n` rounds is then the sum of losses over complete periods plus the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of sequences A and B to determine the period.\n   - **Base Count Calculation**: For each possible pair of moves in one period, count how many times each player loses.\n   - **Remainder Handling**: For the remaining rounds after complete periods, simulate each round to count additional losses.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves iterating over all possible pairs of moves in the sequences (O(m*k)), where m and k are the lengths of the sequences (up to 1000 each, so 1 million operations). This is feasible because 1 million operations are manageable in Python. The remaining rounds are handled in O(n) time, but since n can be large, leveraging the periodicity ensures efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    T = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    base_count_N = 0\n    base_count_P = 0\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(k):\n            a_char = A[i]\n            b_char = B[j]\n            if a_char == b_char:\n                continue\n            if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                base_count_P += 1\n            else:\n                base_count_N += 1\n                \n    cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    count_N_rem = 0\n    count_P_rem = 0\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        idx_A = i % m\n        idx_B = i % k\n        a_char = A[idx_A]\n        b_char = B[idx_B]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n            count_P_rem += 1\n        else:\n            count_N_rem += 1\n            \n    total_N = base_count_N * cycles + count_N_rem\n    total_P = base_count_P * cycles + count_P_rem\n    \n    print(total_N, total_P)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences A and B for both players.\n2. **Period Calculation**: The period `T` is calculated as the LCM of the lengths of sequences A and B, which determines the cycle length for the combined sequences.\n3. **Base Count Calculation**: For each possible pair of moves (one from A and one from B), the code checks if a move results in a loss for either player and updates the respective counters (`base_count_N` for Nikephoros and `base_count_P` for Polycarpus).\n4. **Cycle and Remainder Handling**: The total rounds `n` are divided into complete cycles (`cycles`) and a remainder (`remainder`). The losses from complete cycles are computed by multiplying the base counts by the number of cycles. The remaining rounds are simulated individually to count additional losses.\n5. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed, combining losses from complete cycles and the remainder rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging periodicity and avoids the need for brute-force simulation of each round.",
