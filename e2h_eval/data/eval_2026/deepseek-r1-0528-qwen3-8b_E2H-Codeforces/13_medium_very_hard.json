For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'] (12 notes)\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing the semitone index.\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we will consider all permutations (there are only 6) and check the conditions for major and minor.\n\n Conditions:\n For major: There exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n   distance(x, y) = 4 semitones\n   distance(y, z) = 3 semitones\n\n For minor: There exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n   distance(x, y) = 3 semitones\n   distance(y, z) = 4 semitones\n\n Note: The distance from note a to note b (in the cyclic 12-tone system) can be calculated as:\n   Let a_index and b_index be the indices (0-11). Then the forward distance is (b_index - a_index) % 12, but we want the smallest positive distance? \n However, note the problem: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" (since going up from E to F to F# to G to G# to A to B to C is 8 steps). \n But wait: the example says \"distance between C and E is 4 semitones\" and \"between E and C is 8 semitones\". \n\n Actually, the problem defines the distance from the lowest tone to the highest one. But note: in a chord, we have an unordered set. \n However, the condition for the major triad requires that in some order (which we can think of as ascending) the intervals are 4 and 3.\n\n But note: the example \"C E G\": \n   C -> E: 4 semitones (C->C#=1, C#->D=2, D->D#=3, D#->E=4) so 4.\n   E -> G: E->F=1, F->F#=2, F#->G=3 -> 3.\n\n However, if we consider wrapping around, then the distance from E to C would be 8 (because 12-4=8). But in the condition for the chord, we are not wrapping around for the entire set? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we don't wrap around for the entire set? \n\n But note: the chord is defined by two intervals: 4 and 3. In the major triad, the total span is 7 semitones (from X to Z). \n\n However, the problem also says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\"\n\n This ordering must be in the cyclic order without wrapping? Actually, the example \"C# B F\": \n   They are ordered as \"B C# F\": \n        B to C#: 1 semitone? Actually, the notes are cyclic. Let's map:\n\n We have 12 notes: \n   C:0, C#:1, D:2, D#:3, E:4, F:5, F#:6, G:7, G#:8, A:9, B:10, H:11? \n\n Wait, the problem says: \"after H goes C\", so let's define the mapping:\n\n According to the problem: \n   The notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n So we can assign:\n   C:0\n   C#:1\n   D:2\n   D#:3\n   E:4\n   F:5\n   F#:6\n   G:7\n   G#:8\n   A:9\n   B:10\n   H:11\n\n Now, the example \"C# B F\": \n   B is 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\n How do we order them? The problem says: \"if we order the notes as 'B C# F'\" — so we are considering the cyclic order starting at B and going to C# (which is 1) and then to F (5). \n\n But note: from B (10) to C# (1): in the circle, going forward from B to C# is (1 - 10) mod 12 = (1+12-10) = 3? But wait, the example says 3 semitones.\n\n Actually, the example says: \"between B and C# will be 3 semitones\", but in our mapping, from B(10) to C#(1): \n   If we go forward: from B(10) to C(0) is 2 semitones? (because 10 to 11 is 1, then 11 to 0 is the next, but wait: actually, the next after B is C? No, the next after B is C? But wait, the list: ... B, then H? Or wait, the problem says: \"after H goes C\", so the order is: ... H, then C, then C#. \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\" \n\n And the list: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C.\n\n So the circle is: ... H, then C, then C#, ... \n\n Therefore, the order is:\n   ... , H(11), C(0), C#(1), D(2), ...\n\n Now, the distance from B(10) to C#(1): \n   We can go from 10 to 11 (B to H) is 1 step, then 11 to 0 (H to C) is 1 step, then 0 to 1 (C to C#) is 1 step -> total 3 steps. \n   Alternatively, we can compute: (1 - 10) % 12 = (1 - 10) = -9, then modulo 12: -9 + 12 = 3.\n\n Similarly, the distance from C#(1) to F(5): \n   (5 - 1) % 12 = 4.\n\n So the calculation: \n   To get the distance from note a to note b (in the forward direction without wrapping the entire set arbitrarily) we can do:\n   Let a and b be their indices. Then the forward distance from a to b is (b - a) % 12. But if (b - a) is negative, then we add 12 and then take modulo 12? Actually, we want the positive distance along the circle (without crossing the boundary backward). However, the problem says the distance is from the lowest to the highest. But in the chord, we are allowed to choose any ordering? \n\n Actually, the condition for the chord is defined on an ordering that we consider as the ascending order (so the distance is the smallest positive one in the forward direction). \n\n However, note: the chord condition does not require that the entire set is contiguous, but that there exists an ordering (which might wrap around) such that the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor).\n\n But wait: the example \"C E G\": \n   C(0) to E(4): (4-0)%12 = 4 -> correct.\n   E(4) to G(7): (7-4)%12 = 3 -> correct.\n\n Example \"C# B F\": \n   Ordered as B(10), C#(1), F(5): \n        B to C#: (1-10)%12 = (1-10) = -9 -> then add 12: 3 -> correct.\n        C# to F: (5-1)=4 -> correct.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". That is because if you go from E(4) to C(0): (0-4) mod12 = (0-4) = -4 -> then add 12: 8. But that is the backward distance? \n\n But the condition for the chord is defined for an ordering (which is ascending). So we are always taking the forward distance (the smallest non-negative one that is less than 12) but wait: the example \"C# B F\" uses a forward distance that wraps? \n\n Actually, the problem does not specify that the ordering is the natural ascending order without wrapping. It just says \"order the notes\". \n\n However, the chord definition is based on the two consecutive intervals being 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4) in the circle. \n\n But note: the entire set of three notes must form an interval of 7 semitones (from the first to the last) in the chosen ordering? \n\n However, the problem does not require that the entire set is contiguous. It just requires two consecutive intervals.\n\n Important: The chord definition is independent of the entire octave. So we can consider the circle.\n\n Approach:\n  Step 1: Map the input notes to numbers (0-11).\n  Step 2: Generate all 6 permutations of the three notes (each permutation is a candidate for (X, Y, Z)).\n  Step 3: For each permutation, check:\n      d1 = (y - x) % 12   [but if negative, adjust by adding 12 and then mod 12? Actually, we can use modulo arithmetic: (y-x) % 12, but if negative we can do (y-x+12) %12? However, the modulo operation in Python for negative: (a % 12) is always non-negative. But wait: if y < x, then (y-x) is negative, so (y-x) %12 gives a positive value. However, we must be cautious: the condition for the chord is that the two intervals are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). But note: the entire chord spans 7 semitones (so the total from x to z should be (d1+d2) %12 = (4+3)%12=7, but if we take the forward distances, then the total from x to z is d1+d2, which might be more than 12? Actually, no: because we are taking the forward distance from x to y and y to z, and then the forward distance from x to z should be (z-x)%12, but note that the two intervals together might not be the direct distance from x to z if the chord wraps around? \n\n  However, the condition does not require the direct distance from x to z. It requires two consecutive intervals. \n\n  But note: the example \"C E G\": \n      x=C(0), y=E(4), z=G(7)\n      d1 = (4-0)%12 = 4\n      d2 = (7-4)%12 = 3\n\n  Example \"C# B F\": \n      x=B(10), y=C#(1), z=F(5)\n      d1 = (1-10) %12 = (1-10) = -9 %12 = 3 (because -9+12=3)\n      d2 = (5-1)%12 = 4\n\n  But what if the chord is given as \"E G C\"? \n      Then we have: E(4), G(7), C(0)\n      d1 = (7-4)%12=3, d2=(0-7)%12 = (-7)%12=5 -> doesn't match.\n\n  So we must consider the entire set of three notes and try all 6 permutations.\n\n  However, note: the chord definition requires that the two consecutive intervals (in the chosen ordering) are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n  Step 4: For a given permutation (x,y,z):\n      d1 = (y - x) % 12\n      d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n      Then check if (d1, d2) is (4,3) for major OR (3,4) for minor.\n\n  But wait: what if the two intervals are (4,3) but the entire chord is not contiguous? Actually, the condition is independent of the entire chord. \n\n  However, there's a catch: the two intervals must be the consecutive ones in the ordering. \n\n  But note: the chord is defined by three distinct notes. The problem does not say that the notes must be consecutive, but the intervals are fixed.\n\n  However, the total span from x to z is d1+d2. For a major chord, that is 7 semitones. But if the chord wraps around, then the total span from x to z might be 7, but the direct distance (without going through the wrapping) is 7 mod12. But note: 7 is less than 12, so no problem.\n\n  But what if the chord is spread over two octaves? Actually, the problem states that the notes are repeated cyclically, so we are working modulo 12.\n\n  However, there's another possibility: the chord could be considered in different ways. But the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that we are not allowed to wrap arbitrarily? \n\n  Let me read again: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\"\n\n  This suggests that we should not wrap. But wait, the example \"C# B F\" is given as minor and they are ordering as \"B C# F\", which implies that B is the lowest and F is the highest. \n\n  However, in the circle, B (10) is followed by H (11) and then C (0). So the ordering from B to C# to F is going from B to C# (which crosses the boundary from B to C) and then from C# to F (which is within the same octave). \n\n  But the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". So the entire set must be considered in a linear sequence? \n\n  Actually, the problem states: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\" meaning that the circle is broken at the C note? \n\n  Let me clarify: the example says \"distance between E and C is 8 semitones\". This is the distance from E to C if we go upward (because E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->C: 8 steps). But if we break the circle at C, then the sequence is: ... C, C#, D, ... up to H, and then back to C. \n\n  However, the chord definition does not require that the entire set is contained in one octave. But the problem says: \"if we can order the notes\" — meaning we are allowed to break the circle? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", so we are to find a linear ordering (without wrapping) of the three notes? \n\n  But wait: the example \"C# B F\" orders as \"B C# F\", which is a linear ordering (B, then C#, then F) and the distances are computed as if we are in a linear scale from B to F. \n\n  However, in a linear scale, the distance from B to F would be: \n      B to C: 1 semitone (but wait, B is 10, then C is 0? but in linear scale without wrapping, we don't have negative numbers). \n\n  Actually, the problem does not specify a linear scale, but a circular one. \n\n  After reading the problem statement again: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". \n\n  This suggests that we are to break the circle at the note with the smallest value? \n\n  But note: the example \"C# B F\": \n      B is 10, C# is 1, F is 5. \n      In a linear representation, we can break the circle at B (so we put B at the beginning) and then the next note is C# (which is 1, but 1 is less than 10) — this doesn't work in a linear representation.\n\n  Alternatively, we can consider the entire set and break the circle so that the three notes are in increasing order (without wrapping). But wait, the example \"C# B F\" is ordered as B, C#, F. \n\n  How did they get that? They started at B (which is the highest in the circle? because after B comes C, which is lower in the circle? Actually, in the circle, the order is: ... , C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C, ...\n\n  So the circle is: 0,1,2,...,11,0,...\n\n  The note B is 10, and then the next note is H (11) and then C (0). \n\n  The problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". So we must assign a linear order. \n\n  What if we consider the entire set of three notes and sort them in the circle? \n\n  We can break the circle arbitrarily. Actually, the standard way to handle chords is to consider the root note. But the problem does not specify which note is the root.\n\n  Let me reexamine the examples:\n\n  Example 1: \"C E G\" — major. \n      Notes: C(0), E(4), G(7). \n      The ordering is C, E, G: \n          C to E: 4, E to G: 3.\n\n  Example 2: \"C# B F\" — minor.\n      Notes: C#(1), B(10), F(5). \n      The ordering is B, C#, F: \n          B to C#: (1-10) %12 = 3, then C# to F: (5-1)=4.\n\n  Example 3: \"A B H\" — strange.\n\n  How about we consider the following: since the circle has 12 notes, we can break the circle at the note that has the smallest index? But wait, \"B C# F\": \n      B is 10, C# is 1, F is 5. The smallest index is 1 (C#). Then we break the circle at C# and consider the linear order: \n          Start at C#: then the next notes: F(5) and B(10). Then the order would be: C#, F, B. \n          Then d1 = (5-1)=4, d2=(10-5)=5 -> not 3 and 4.\n\n  But wait, the problem says: \"if we can order the notes\" — meaning any order. So we are allowed to choose the order arbitrarily, as long as the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4).\n\n  Therefore, we must try all 6 permutations.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Map the input notes to numbers.\n  2. Let the three numbers be a, b, c.\n  3. Generate all permutations: [ (a,b,c), (a,c,b), (b,a,c), (b,c,a), (c,a,b), (c,b,a) ]\n  4. For each permutation (x,y,z):\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        # But note: the modulo operation for negative: in Python, (y-x) % 12 will give a result between 0 and 11.\n\n        However, we must note: the condition for the chord is that the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). But note: the entire set of three notes must be distinct.\n\n        Also, we must ensure that the two intervals are the consecutive ones. But the problem does not specify that the entire set must be contiguous, so we are only checking the two consecutive intervals.\n\n        But wait: what if the chord is given as \"E G C\" (which is the same as \"C E G\")? \n            Then we have a permutation (E, G, C): \n                d1 = (G-E)%12 = (7-4)=3\n                d2 = (C-G)%12 = (0-7)%12 = (-7)%12=5 -> not matching.\n\n        However, we must also consider that the chord is defined by the two consecutive intervals. In the chord \"C E G\", the two consecutive intervals are from C to E (4) and E to G (3). But if we take the ordering (E, G, C), then we are not getting the consecutive intervals that form the chord. \n\n        The problem says: \"if we can order the notes so as the distance between X and Y equals 4 and between Y and Z equals 3\". \n\n        So the ordering must be such that the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3 (for major). \n\n        In the example \"C E G\", the ordering (C, E, G) works. The ordering (E, G, C) does not because the interval from E to G is 3, and from G to C is 5 (which is not 3). \n\n        But note: the chord condition does not require that the entire set is covered by the two intervals? Actually, the two intervals are between consecutive notes in the chosen ordering.\n\n        Therefore, we must check every permutation.\n\n  5. If we find at least one permutation that satisfies (d1, d2) == (4,3) then it's major. Similarly for (3,4) for minor.\n\n  However, note: the problem says: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\"\n\n  So we can check:\n\n      if we found a major: print \"major\"\n      else if we found a minor: print \"minor\"\n      else: print \"strange\"\n\n  But wait: what if the same chord can be interpreted in two different ways? \n\n  Example: is there a chord that is both major and minor? The problem says no.\n\n  However, let's consider: \n      Major: (4,3) \n      Minor: (3,4)\n\n  Are these the same? No.\n\n  But note: the entire set of three notes must be the same. \n\n  Example: \n      Consider the notes: C, E, G. \n          Permutation (C, E, G): (4,3) -> major.\n          Permutation (C, G, E): (G-C)= (7-0)=7, (E-G)= (4-7)= -3 %12=9 -> not matching.\n\n      Another: notes C, Eb, G? \n          Eb is D# (3). \n          Let's try: \n          Permutations: \n            (C, Eb, G): (3-0)=3, (7-3)=4 -> minor? \n            (C, G, Eb): (7-0)=7, (3-7)= -4 %12=8 -> no.\n            (Eb, C, G): (0-3)= -3 %12=9, (7-0)=7 -> no.\n            (Eb, G, C): (7-3)=4, (0-7)= -7 %12=5 -> no.\n            (G, C, Eb): (0-7)= -7 %12=5, (3-0)=3 -> no.\n            (G, Eb, C): (3-7)= -4 %12=8, (0-3)= -3 %12=9 -> no.\n\n      So C Eb G is minor.\n\n  So the algorithm:\n\n      mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n      notes = input().split()\n      nums = [mapping[note] for note in notes]\n\n      from itertools import permutations\n      perms = permutations(nums)\n\n      is_major = False\n      is_minor = False\n\n      for p in perms:\n          x, y, z = p\n          d1 = (y - x) % 12\n          d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n          # But wait: the condition for the chord requires two consecutive intervals, but what if the entire set is not contiguous? \n          # Actually, the condition is independent of the entire set: we only care about the two consecutive intervals.\n\n          if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n              is_major = True\n          if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n              is_minor = True\n\n      if is_major:\n          print(\"major\")\n      elif is_minor:\n          print(\"minor\")\n      else:\n          print(\"strange\")\n\n  However, wait: what about the ordering that might not be the one that covers the entire set? \n\n  Example: the chord \"C E G\" in the ordering (E, G, C) gives (3,5) which doesn't match, so we don't mark it as minor or major. But we already found it in (C,E,G). \n\n  But note: the problem says the chord is an unordered set. We are checking all permutations.\n\n  However, there's a catch: the two intervals must be consecutive in the chosen ordering. The above code checks the two consecutive intervals from the first to the second and then the second to the third. \n\n  But what if the chord is defined by the intervals but the ordering is not the one we are using? \n\n  Example: the chord \"C E G\" can also be ordered as (C, G, E): \n        d1 = (G-C)=7, d2=(E-G)= (4-7)= -3 %12=9 -> not 4 and 3, nor 3 and 4.\n\n  So we are only checking the consecutive intervals of the chosen ordering.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"if we can order the notes so as the distance between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\". \n\n  The ordering (C, E, G) is one valid ordering. The ordering (E, G, C) is not. \n\n  Therefore, the above code is correct.\n\n  However, wait: what if the chord is given as \"E G C\" (same as \"C E G\")? Then we have the permutation (E, G, C) which doesn't satisfy, but we have the permutation (C, E, G) which does (if we consider the set, we are generating all permutations including (C, E, G)). \n\n  But wait: the input is given as three space separated notes. We are mapping them to numbers and then permuting the numbers. \n\n  Example input: \"E G C\" -> nums = [4,7,0]. Then one of the permutations is (0,4,7) which is (C,E,G). \n\n  So we are covering all possibilities.\n\n  But wait: the example input is given as three notes. The set {C, E, G} is the same as {E, G, C}. \n\n  Therefore, the code should be:\n\n      mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n      s = input().strip()\n      notes_list = s.split()\n\n      # Map each note\n      try:\n          nums = [mapping[note] for note in notes_list]\n      except KeyError:\n          # The problem states the input format, but just in case, we assume the input is correct.\n          print(\"strange\")\n          exit(0)\n\n      from itertools import permutations\n      perms = permutations(nums)\n\n      is_major = False\n      is_minor = False\n\n      for p in perms:\n          x, y, z = p\n          d1 = (y - x) % 12\n          d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n          # However, note: the chord condition requires that the two intervals are consecutive. But what if the entire chord is not contiguous? \n          # Actually, the condition is independent of the entire chord. We are only checking the two consecutive intervals.\n\n          # But wait: what if the two intervals are 4 and 3, but the third interval from x to z is not 7? \n          # The condition does not require the entire chord to be 7, but the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3. \n          # However, the entire chord from x to z is 7 semitones (if we take the forward path without wrapping) but note: \n          #   In the example \"C E G\": from C to E to G: total from C to G is 7, but if we consider the circle, the direct distance from C to G is 7, and 7 mod12 is 7, which is the same as 4+3.\n\n          # But what if the chord wraps around? \n          #   Example: the chord \"B D# G\": \n          #       B(10), D#(3), G(7)\n          #       One ordering: (B, D#, G): \n          #           d1 = (3-10)%12 = (3-10) = -7 %12=5, d2=(7-3)%12=4 -> not matching.\n          #       Another: (B, G, D#): \n          #           d1 = (7-10)%12 = -3 %12=9, d2=(3-7)%12=-4%12=8 -> no.\n          #       Another: (D#, B, G): \n          #           d1 = (10-3)%12=7, d2=(7-10)%12=-3%12=9 -> no.\n          #       Another: (D#, G, B): \n          #           d1 = (7-3)=4, d2=(10-7)=3 -> major! \n          #       So the chord \"B D# G\" is major.\n\n          #   Now, how about the direct distance from D# to G is 4, and from G to B is 3 (because from G to A:1, A to A#:2, A# to B:3? But wait, from G(7) to B(10): (10-7)=3. So the ordering (D#, G, B) is (4,3). \n\n          #   But note: the entire set of three notes: D#, G, B. The ordering (D#, G, B) is ascending? In the circle, from D#(3) to G(7) is 4, then from G(7) to B(10) is 3. \n\n          #   However, the problem says the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. In this ordering, the lowest is D# and the highest is B? But B is higher than D#? In the circle, the note with index 10 is higher than 3? \n\n          #   Actually, we break the circle arbitrarily. The condition does not require that the entire set is within one octave. \n\n          #   But note: the example \"C# B F\" was given as minor, and they broke the circle at B (which is the highest) and then went to C# (the lowest) and then to F (middle). \n\n          #   The key is: we are allowed to break the circle arbitrarily. The problem does not specify the root note.\n\n          #   Therefore, the code above is correct.\n\n          if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n              is_major = True\n          if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n              is_minor = True\n\n      if is_major:\n          print(\"major\")\n      elif is_minor:\n          print(\"minor\")\n      else:\n          print(\"strange\")\n\n  However, wait: the above code does not account for the fact that the two intervals must be the consecutive ones in the circle. But note: the modulo operation gives the forward distance. \n\n  But there's a problem: the condition for the chord is that the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3 (for major) and 3 and 4 (for minor). \n\n  However, in the example \"B D# G\": \n        Ordering (D#, G, B): \n            d1 = (7-3)%12 = 4 -> correct.\n            d2 = (10-7)%12 = 3 -> correct. -> major.\n\n  Another example: \"D# G B\": \n        Ordering (D#, G, B): same as above -> major.\n\n  But wait: what if we break the circle differently? \n\n  Actually, the problem does not require that the entire set is contained in one octave. We are allowed to wrap. \n\n  However, the above code uses modulo 12 for the distance. \n\n  But note: the distance from G to B is 3, which is correct. \n\n  However, there's a catch: what if the chord is given as \"G B D#\"?\n        Ordering (G, B, D#): \n            d1 = (10-7)%12=3\n            d2 = (3-10)%12 = (3-10+12)%12=5 -> no.\n        Ordering (G, D#, B): \n            d1 = (3-7)%12 = -4 %12=8\n            d2 = (10-3)%12=7 -> no.\n\n        But wait, we must consider all permutations. One of the permutations is (D#, G, B) which we already checked.\n\n  So the code is correct.\n\n  Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n  Example 1: Input \"C E G\"\n      nums = [0,4,7]\n      Permutations: \n          (0,4,7): d1=(4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major -> output \"major\"\n\n  Example 2: Input \"C# B F\"\n      nums = [1,10,5]\n      Permutations: \n          (1,10,5): d1=(10-1)%12=9, d2=(5-10)%12=-5%12=7 -> no.\n          (1,5,10): d1=(5-1)%12=4, d2=(10-5)%12=5 -> no.\n          (10,1,5): d1=(1-10)%12=-9%12=3, d2=(5-1)%12=4 -> minor -> output \"minor\"\n\n  Example 3: Input \"A B H\"\n      nums = [9,10,11]\n      Permutations: \n          (9,10,11): d1=1, d2=1 -> no.\n          (9,11,10): d1=2, d2=-1%12=11 -> no.\n          (10,9,11): d1=-1%12=11, d2=2 -> no.\n          (10,11,9): d1=1, d2=-2%12=10 -> no.\n          (11,9,10): d1=-2%12=10, d2=1 -> no.\n          (11,10,9): d1=-1%12=11, d2=-1%12=11 -> no.\n\n      So output \"strange\"\n\n  This matches the example.\n\n  However, wait: the example input \"A B H\" — note that H is 11. \n\n  But what if the input is given in a different order? \n\n  Example: \"H A B\"\n      nums = [11,9,10] -> same set as above.\n\n  So the code is robust.\n\n  But wait: the example input \"C E G\" and \"E G C\" are the same set. \n\n  However, the input is given as three space separated notes. The order in the input does not matter",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval conditions for either a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a unique integer from 0 to 11 based on its position in the 12-note chromatic scale (C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4, F=5, F#=6, G=7, G#=8, A=9, B=10, H=11).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: All six possible permutations of the three input notes are generated. This allows us to check every possible ordering of the notes.\n3. **Checking Intervals**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated. The first interval is the distance from the first note to the second, and the second interval is the distance from the second note to the third. These distances are computed modulo 12 to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Classifying the Chord**: If any permutation has intervals of 4 and 3 semitones (in that order), the chord is classified as major. If any permutation has intervals of 3 and 4 semitones (in that order), the chord is classified as minor. If neither condition is met, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    mapping = {'C': 0, 'C#': 1, 'D': 2, 'D#': 3, 'E': 4, 'F': 5, 'F#': 6, 'G': 7, 'G#': 8, 'A': 9, 'B': 10, 'H': 11}\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    nums = [mapping[note] for note in data]\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    perms = permutations(nums)\n    \n    is_major = False\n    is_minor = False\n    \n    for p in perms:\n        x, y, z = p\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            is_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            is_minor = True\n            \n    if is_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif is_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `mapping` dictionary assigns each note to a unique number from 0 to 11, representing their positions in the chromatic scale.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into individual note strings, which are then converted to their corresponding numerical values using the `mapping` dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: Using the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module, all six possible orderings of the three input notes are generated.\n4. **Interval Calculation**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated. The modulo operation ensures the intervals are correctly computed even when crossing the boundary between H and C (11 to 0).\n5. **Chord Classification**: The intervals are checked against the conditions for major (4 and 3 semitones) and minor (3 and 4 semitones) chords. If either condition is met, the chord is classified accordingly. If no conditions are met, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the input notes to determine the chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.",
