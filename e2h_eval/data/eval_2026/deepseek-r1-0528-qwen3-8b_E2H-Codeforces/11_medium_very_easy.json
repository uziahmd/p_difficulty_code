A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n Each bottle has 'l' milliliters, and there are 'k' bottles -> total drink = k * l.\n For the drink: each toast requires 'nl' milliliters. So total toasts from drink = (k * l) // nl.\n\n They have 'c' limes, each cut into 'd' slices -> total lime slices = c * d.\n Each toast requires 1 slice. So total toasts from lime = c * d.\n\n They have 'p' grams of salt. Each toast requires 'np' grams. So total toasts from salt = p // np.\n\n However, note that the friends are n in number and they must all drink the same amount.\n\n Therefore, the total number of toasts we can make is limited by the minimum of the three above.\n\n But then we must also consider that the toasts are shared among n friends. Since each friend must make the same number of toasts, \n the total number of toasts must be divisible by n? Actually, no: we can only make whole toasts, and we cannot exceed the available resources.\n\n The problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast.\n\n So for T total toasts, we require:\n   T <= (k * l) // nl\n   T <= c * d\n   T <= p // np\n\n And since there are n friends, each friend makes t = T / n toasts? But wait, actually the total toasts T must be such that when divided equally among n friends, \n each gets an integer number of toasts? Actually, the problem does not say that the total toasts must be divisible by n. It says:\n\n \"the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\n This means that the number of toasts per friend must be the same, so the total toasts T must be a multiple of n? \n\n Let's re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" for one toast. \n\n But note: if we let each friend make t toasts, then total toasts T = n * t.\n\n Conditions for t:\n   n * t <= (k * l) // nl   => t <= (k * l) // (nl * n)\n   n * t <= c * d           => t <= (c * d) // n\n   n * t <= p // np         => t <= (p // np) // n\n\n However, wait: the drink condition is on the total drink: total drink needed is n * t * nl, and we have k*l. So condition: n * t * nl <= k*l.\n\n Similarly, for lime: we need n * t slices, so n * t <= c * d.\n For salt: n * t * np <= p.\n\n But note: the example calculation did:\n\n Overall the friends have 4*5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3 ≈6.66 -> 6 toasts.\n Then they said: min(6,80,100)=6, then divided by 3 (number of friends) -> 2.\n\n However, note that 6 toasts for 3 friends: each friend gets 2 toasts, which is consistent.\n\n But wait, the example does not use the condition per friend but total. Actually, the example calculated the maximum toasts from each resource without considering the friends:\n\n   Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 ml per toast? Actually, wait: the example says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. In the example, nl=1 (from the input string: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1').\n\n So for one toast, each friend needs 1 ml? Then for 3 friends and 1 toast, they need 3 ml. Then total drink needed for T toasts is 3*T.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be interpreted as: the entire group makes T toasts, and each toast uses 1 lime slice and np grams of salt, and for the drink, each toast requires nl milliliters (but note: the example input says nl=3, np=1).\n\n Let me clarify with the example input: \n   Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n\n   Here: \n      n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n   Total drink: 4*5 = 20 ml.\n   Each toast requires 3 ml (because nl=3). So maximum toasts from drink: 20 // 3 = 6.\n\n   Limes: 10*8 = 80 slices -> 80 toasts.\n   Salt: 100 // 1 = 100 toasts.\n\n   Then the limiting factor is 6 toasts.\n\n   Then we divide by the number of friends (3) to get the number of toasts per friend: 6 // 3 = 2.\n\n However, note: if we think about the drink, for 3 friends and 2 toasts per friend, the total drink needed is 3 (friends) * 2 (toasts) * 3 (ml per toast) = 18 ml, which is available.\n\n But wait, the example calculation didn't break down by per friend. It just took the total toasts (6) and divided by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2.\n\n So the correct approach:\n\n Step 1: Calculate the maximum number of toasts that can be made for the entire group from each resource.\n\n   total_drink = k * l\n   total_lime_slices = c * d\n   total_salt = p\n\n   Then the maximum toasts (for the entire group) is limited by:\n\n        T1 = total_drink // nl       [because each toast requires nl ml]\n        T2 = total_lime_slices        [each toast requires one slice, so exactly the number of slices]\n        T3 = total_salt // np         [each toast requires np grams]\n\n   So maximum total toasts T_total = min(T1, T2, T3)\n\n Step 2: Now, we have to distribute these toasts equally among n friends. Since each friend must make the same number of toasts, the total toasts must be divisible by n? \n\n   Actually, we can make at most floor(min(T1, T2, T3) / n) * n toasts? But wait, the problem doesn't require the total toasts to be divisible by n? \n\n   However, the problem says \"each friend needs ... for one toast\", meaning that if we are going to make t toasts per friend, then the total toasts is n*t.\n\n   Therefore, the condition for the drink becomes: n*t * nl <= k*l  => t <= (k*l) // (nl * n)\n\n   Similarly, for lime: n*t <= c*d  => t <= (c*d) // n\n   For salt: n*t * np <= p  => t <= p // (np * n)\n\n   Then the answer is the minimum t from these three.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        t2 = (c * d) // n\n        t3 = p // (n * np)\n\n   Then answer = min(t1, t2, t3)\n\n But wait, in the example:\n\n   n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n   t1 = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2 (since 20//9 is 2 in integer division)\n   t2 = (10*8) // 3 = 80 // 3 = 26\n   t3 = 100 // (3*1) = 100 // 3 = 33\n\n   Then min(2,26,33)=2 -> matches.\n\n   Let me test with the second example:\n\n   Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n   Here: n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n   t1 = (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n   t2 = (1*19) // 5 = 19//5 = 3\n   t3 = 90 // (5*3) = 90//15 = 6\n\n   Then min(50,3,6)=3 -> matches.\n\n   Third example:\n\n   Input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n\n   Here: n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1.\n\n   t1 = (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n   t2 = (25*23) // 10 = 575 // 10 = 57\n   t3 = 1 // (10*1) = 1//10 = 0\n\n   Then min(2000,57,0)=0 -> matches.\n\n Therefore, the solution is:\n\n   Read the 8 integers.\n   Compute:\n        t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n        t2 = (c * d) // n\n        t3 = p // (n * np)\n\n   Then output min(t1, t2, t3)\n\n But wait, what if the division is not exact? We are using integer floor division, which is appropriate because we can't make partial toasts.\n\n However, note: the conditions for drink and salt require that the total amount is at least n*t*nl and n*t*np respectively. Using floor division for the constraints is correct because we can't use fractions.\n\n But note: the example used the total toasts (without breaking down by n) and then divided by n. Our method is equivalent because:\n\n   Condition for drink: n*t*nl <= k*l   => t <= (k*l) // (n*nl)   [using integer floor division]\n\n   Similarly for the others.\n\n Therefore, code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the numbers are positive integers and we are to output a single integer.\n\n Let's write the code.\n\n Example: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" -> [3,4,5,10,8,100,3,1] -> n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n We'll split the input and convert to integers.\n\n Code:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   n = int(data[0])\n   k = int(data[1])\n   l = int(data[2])\n   c = int(data[3])\n   d = int(data[4])\n   p = int(data[5])\n   nl = int(data[6])\n   np = int(data[7])\n\n   t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n   t2 = (c * d) // n\n   t3 = p // (n * np)\n\n   ans = min(t1, t2, t3)\n\n   print(ans)\n\n But wait: what if any of the denominators (n * nl, or n * np) is zero? The problem states that the numbers are at least 1, so no zero.\n\n However, note: the example input uses nl=3 and np=1, and n>=1, so denominators are at least 1.\n\n Let's run the examples:\n\n Example 1: \n   n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1 -> 2\n\n Example 2: \n   n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3 -> 3\n\n Example 3: \n   n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1 -> 0\n\n This matches.\n\n But wait, why in the example calculation they computed the total toasts from the drink as 20/3 (which is 6) and then divided by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2? \n\n Actually, 6 toasts for the entire group, so per friend: 6/3 = 2. \n\n But note: our method for drink: (k*l)//(n*nl) = 20//(3*3)=20//9=2.\n\n Why is this equivalent?\n\n Because the condition for the entire group for the drink is: total_drink >= n * t * nl.\n\n We have t = 2, then n*t*nl = 3*2*3 = 18, and 18<=20 -> valid.\n\n But the maximum total toasts from drink is 20//3 = 6, and 6 must be divisible by n? Not necessarily, but we are constrained by the fact that the toasts must be distributed equally.\n\n Actually, the total number of toasts we can make is limited by the minimum of the three resource limits, but then we must also ensure that the total toasts is divisible by n? \n\n No, because we are not directly using the total toasts. We are computing the maximum t (toasts per friend) such that:\n\n   n * t * nl <= k * l   => t <= (k*l) / (n*nl)   [using integer floor]\n\n   n * t <= c * d        => t <= (c*d) / n\n\n   n * t * np <= p       => t <= p / (n*np)\n\n And then we take the minimum of these three.\n\n But note: the example did:\n\n   Without considering the equal distribution, the drink allows up to 6 toasts (for the entire group). But if we try to assign 3 toasts per friend (so 9 toasts total), then the drink requirement is 9*3=27 ml, which exceeds 20 ml.\n\n   So the maximum t (per friend) is 2, which gives 6 toasts (same as the example's total toasts).\n\n Therefore, our method is correct.\n\n However, note: the example did not use the per-friend formula for the drink. They used the total toasts (without knowing the distribution) and then divided by n. \n\n But in fact, the drink condition in the example was for the entire group: 20 ml for 3 friends, and each toast requires 3 ml. So for the entire group, if we make T toasts, we need 3*T ml. But also, if we are making T toasts, then each friend makes T/3 toasts (if T is divisible by 3). However, the problem says they must all drink the same amount, so T must be divisible by 3.\n\n But note: the example did not require T to be divisible by 3. They just took the total toasts from drink as 6, and then divided by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2. \n\n However, what if the total toasts from drink is 7? Then 7 is not divisible by 3. But wait, we cannot have fractional toasts. The example's method would be: min(7, ...) = 7, then 7/3 is about 2.33, so floor to 2? Or do we have to adjust the total toasts to be the largest multiple of 3 that does not exceed the resource limits?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"each friend needs ... for one toast\". So if we want each friend to make t toasts, then the total toasts is n*t. \n\n Therefore, we cannot use a total toast count that is not divisible by n.\n\n But note: our method computes t as the minimum of:\n\n   (k*l) // (n*nl)   -> this is the maximum t such that n*t*nl <= k*l\n   (c*d) // n        -> maximum t such that n*t <= c*d\n   p // (n*np)       -> maximum t such that n*t*np <= p\n\n And then we take the minimum. This ensures that the total toasts (n*t) does not exceed any of the resources.\n\n However, the example's method:\n\n   They computed the total toasts from drink as (k*l)//nl = 20//3 = 6, then divided by n to get 2.\n\n   But note: 6 is the total toasts from drink (without considering distribution). But if we set t=2, then total toasts is 6, which is the same as the drink condition's total toasts.\n\n   However, if the drink condition gave 7 (which is not divisible by 3) then the example's method would have taken 7 and then 7/3 ~ 2.33 -> but then we cannot have 7 toasts because 7 is not divisible by 3. \n\n   How would we handle that?\n\n   Actually, the example's method is flawed because it does not account for the fact that the total toasts must be divisible by n. \n\n   But wait, the example's method is:\n\n        total_toasts = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )\n        then toasts_per_friend = total_toasts // n\n\n   However, that is different from our method.\n\n   Let me check with a hypothetical example where the drink condition gives 7 and n=3:\n\n        total_toasts = min(7, ...) [assuming lime and salt allow at least 7] -> 7\n        toasts_per_friend = 7 // 3 = 2\n\n   But wait, with 2 toasts per friend, the total toasts is 6, which is less than 7. \n\n   But the example's method would say 2, while our method:\n\n        t1 = (k*l) // (n*nl) = (total_drink) // (nl * n) = 20 // (3*3) = 6 // 3? Wait, let me recast:\n\n   Actually, the example's total drink is 20 ml, and each toast requires 3 ml. The maximum total toasts from drink is 6. But wait, if we use 6 toasts, then the drink condition is met. \n\n   The flaw in the example's method is that they did not account for the fact that the drink condition is for the entire group and must be at least the total toasts (regardless of divisibility by n). \n\n   However, note: the drink condition is based on the total volume: total_volume_needed = total_toasts * nl. And they have k*l. So the condition is: total_toasts * nl <= k*l.\n\n   But the example's method uses: total_toasts = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ) and then toasts_per_friend = total_toasts // n.\n\n   This does not guarantee that the drink condition is met for the total_toasts (because (k*l)//nl is the maximum total toasts from drink, so we are safe for drink). However, the issue is that the total_toasts might not be divisible by n. \n\n   But note: the problem requires that the friends all drink the same amount. So we cannot have a total_toasts that is not divisible by n. \n\n   The example's method would give 2 for the first sample, but if we had a scenario where the total_toasts from drink is 7 (which is not divisible by 3) and the other resources allow at least 7, then the example's method would give 2 (because 7//3=2). \n\n   However, with 2 toasts per friend, we use 6 toasts (which is acceptable). But what if we could use 7 toasts? Then the drink condition would require 7*3=21 ml, but we have only 20 ml. So actually, the drink condition does not allow 7 toasts. \n\n   So the example's method is actually:\n\n        total_toasts = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )   # This gives the maximum total toasts without considering the equal distribution constraint.\n\n        Then, toasts_per_friend = total_toasts // n   # This gives the number of toasts per friend, but note: we are effectively truncating the total_toasts to the largest multiple of n that is <= total_toasts.\n\n   However, is that the same as our method?\n\n   Our method: we compute the maximum t (toasts per friend) such that:\n\n        t <= (k*l) // (n*nl)\n        t <= (c*d) // n\n        t <= p // (n*np)\n\n   Then toasts_per_friend = min( (k*l)//(n*nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n*np) )\n\n   Now, note: \n\n        (k*l) // (n*nl) = floor((k*l) / (n*nl))\n\n        (k*l)//nl // n   is not necessarily equal to (k*l)//(n*nl) because of integer division properties.\n\n   Example: k*l=20, n=3, nl=3: \n        (20)//(3*3)=20//9=2\n        (20)//3 //3 = 6//3=2 -> same.\n\n   But consider k*l=19, n=3, nl=3:\n        (19)//(3*3)=19//9=2\n        (19)//3 //3 = 6//3=2 -> same.\n\n   Another: k*l=21, n=3, nl=3:\n        (21)//9=2\n        21//3=7, 7//3=2 -> same.\n\n   However, consider k*l=18, n=3, nl=3:\n        (18)//9=2\n        18//3=6, 6//3=2 -> same.\n\n   But wait, what if we have non-integer intermediate steps? Actually, the two methods are mathematically the same because:\n\n        floor(floor(a/b)/c) = floor(a/(b*c))   ??? \n\n   Actually, it's true for positive integers a,b,c? \n\n        Let a = b*q + r1 (0<=r1<b), then floor(a/b)=q.\n        Then floor(q/c) = floor((a/b)/c) = ?\n\n        But note: a/(b*c) = (b*q+r1)/(b*c) = q/(c) + r1/(b*c)\n\n        Then floor(a/(b*c)) = floor(q/c + r1/(b*c))\n\n        Now, q = c*k + r2 (0<=r2<c), then q/c = k + r2/c, so floor(q/c + r1/(b*c)) = k + floor(r2/c + r1/(b*c))? \n\n        However, note: r2 < c, and r1 < b, so r2/c + r1/(b*c) < 1 + (b-1)/(b*c) which is less than 2. So if k is an integer, then floor(q/c + r1/(b*c)) = k + floor(r2/c + r1/(b*c)) but note that r2/c < 1, so unless r2/c + r1/(b*c) >=1, then floor(q/c + r1/(b*c)) = k.\n\n        Actually, we can't assume that floor(floor(a/b)/c) = floor(a/(b*c)). \n\n   Example: a=10, b=3, c=2.\n\n        floor(10/3)=3, then floor(3/2)=1.\n        floor(10/(3*2))=floor(10/6)=1 -> same.\n\n   Example: a=11, b=3, c=2.\n\n        floor(11/3)=3, floor(3/2)=1.\n        floor(11/6)=1 -> same.\n\n   Example: a=12, b=3, c=2.\n\n        floor(12/3)=4, floor(4/2)=2.\n        floor(12/6)=2 -> same.\n\n   Example: a=13, b=3, c=2.\n\n        floor(13/3)=4, floor(4/2)=2.\n        floor(13/6)=2 -> same.\n\n   Example: a=14, b=3, c=2.\n\n        floor(14/3)=4, floor(4/2)=2.\n        floor(14/6)=2 -> same.\n\n   Example: a=15, b=3, c=2.\n\n        floor(15/3)=5, floor(5/2)=2.\n        floor(15/6)=2 -> same.\n\n   But wait, let me choose a=1, b=3, c=2: \n        floor(1/3)=0, floor(0/2)=0.\n        floor(1/6)=0 -> same.\n\n   However, consider a=5, b=2, c=3:\n\n        floor(5/2)=2, floor(2/3)=0.\n        floor(5/6)=0 -> same.\n\n   But now consider a=7, b=2, c=3:\n\n        floor(7/2)=3, floor(3/3)=1.\n        floor(7/6)=1 -> same.\n\n   It appears that for positive integers, floor(floor(a/b)/c) = floor(a/(b*c)) holds.\n\n   Why? \n\n        We know that floor(a/b) is the greatest integer <= a/b.\n\n        Then floor(floor(a/b)/c) is the greatest integer <= (floor(a/b))/c.\n\n        But note: floor(a/(b*c)) is the greatest integer <= a/(b*c).\n\n        We have: a/(b*c) >= floor(a/b)/c? \n\n        Actually, we know that floor(a/b) <= a/b, so floor(a/b)/c <= a/(b*c). \n\n        Also, we know that floor(a/b) >= a/b - 1 + 1/b? Not exactly. \n\n        But we can use the property:\n\n        floor(x/y) is the greatest integer m such that m <= x/y.\n\n        Then floor(floor(x/y)/z) is the greatest integer m such that m <= floor(x/y)/z <= (x/y)/z = x/(y*z). \n\n        However, note that floor(x/y)/z might be less than x/(y*z). \n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            m = floor(floor(a/b)/c) \n            => m <= floor(a/b)/c < m+1\n\n            But floor(a/b) <= a/b, so m <= (a/b)/c, i.e., m <= a/(b*c). \n\n        And also, since floor(a/b) >= a/b - (b-1)/b, then floor(a/b)/c >= (a/b - (b-1)/b)/c = a/(b*c) - (b-1)/(b*c).\n\n        But note: we are taking floor, so we don't know if m is the same as floor(a/(b*c)).\n\n   However, from the examples above, it seems to hold. \n\n   Actually, we can use the identity:\n\n        floor(floor(a/b)/c) = floor(a/(b*c))\n\n   because of the distributive property of floor over multiplication in integers? \n\n   Since a, b, c are positive integers, we can write:\n\n        Let a = q*b + r, with 0<=r<b.\n\n        Then floor(a/b)=q.\n\n        Then floor(q/c) = floor(q/c).\n\n        Also, a/(b*c) = (q*b+r)/(b*c) = (q*b)/(b*c) + r/(b*c) = q/c + r/(b*c).\n\n        Then floor(a/(b*c)) = floor(q/c + r/(b*c)).\n\n        Now, note that q/c is a rational number. Let q = s*c + t, with 0<=t<c.\n\n        Then q/c = s + t/c, so:\n\n            floor(q/c + r/(b*c)) = s + floor(t/c + r/(b*c))\n\n        But t < c, so t/c < 1, and r/(b*c) < 1 (since r < b, so r/(b*c) < 1/c + ... actually no, r/(b*c) is positive and less than 1). \n\n        Now, t/c + r/(b*c) is less than 1 + 1/(b*c) (which is < 2). \n\n        So floor(t/c + r/(b*c)) is either 0 or 1.\n\n        But note: t is the remainder of q divided by c, so t = q mod c, and r/(b*c) is the fractional part from the first division.\n\n        However, we have:\n\n            q = floor(a/b) = floor( (a/b) ), and then we are dividing that by c and taking floor again.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that:\n\n            floor(floor(a/b)/c) = floor(a/(b*c))\n\n        is a known identity for positive integers a, b, c.\n\n   Therefore, both methods are equivalent.\n\n   So we can use either:\n\n        Method 1 (as we did): \n            t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n            t2 = (c * d) // n\n            t3 = p // (n * np)\n\n        OR\n\n        Method 2 (as in the example's thought process but adjusted for the distribution):\n\n            total_toasts = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )\n            t = total_toasts // n\n\n        But wait, are they the same?\n\n        In our first example: \n            total_toasts = min(20//3, 80, 100//1) = min(6,80,100)=6, then t=6//3=2.\n\n        In our second example:\n            total_toasts = min(1000//4, 19, 90//3) = min(250,19,30)=19, then t=19//5=3 (since 19//5=3).\n\n        But wait, the second example input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n        With our method: \n            t1 = (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000//20=50\n            t2 = (1*19) //5 = 19//5=3\n            t3 = 90 // (5*3)=90//15=6\n            min(50,3,6)=3.\n\n        With the example's method: \n            total_toasts = min(1000//4, 19, 90//3) = min(250,19,30)=19, then t=19//5=3.\n\n        So same.\n\n        Third example: \n            Input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n            Our method: \n                t1 = 1000000 // (10*50)=1000000//500=2000\n                t2 = (25*23)//10=575//10=57\n                t3 = 1// (10*1)=0\n                min(2000,57,0)=0.\n\n            Example's method:\n                total_toasts = min(1000000//50, 575, 1//1) = min(20000,575,1)=1\n                then t=1//10=0.\n\n        So they are the same.\n\n        Why? \n\n            In the example's method, the drink condition: (k*l)//nl = (k*l)//nl, but note that the drink condition for the entire group is (k*l) >= total_toasts * nl, so total_toasts <= (k*l)//nl.\n\n            But then the total_toasts must be at most (k*l)//nl, and also at most the other two.\n\n            Then we set t = total_toasts // n.\n\n            In our method, we set t = min( (k*l)//(n*nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n*np) ).\n\n            But note: \n\n                (k*l)//(n*nl) = floor((k*l) / (n*nl)) = floor(total_drink / (nl * n))\n\n            And the example's method: \n                total_toasts = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )   [Note: (k*l)//nl is floor(k*l/nl)]\n                Then t = floor(total_toasts / n)\n\n            Now, note:\n\n                floor((k*l) / (n*nl)) = floor( (floor(k*l/nl)) / n )   ?\n\n            Actually, we have:\n\n                floor(k*l/nl) <= k*l/nl, so floor(floor(k*l/nl)/n) <= floor(k*l/(n*nl)).\n\n            But is floor(floor(k*l/nl)/n) = floor(k*l/(n*nl)) ?\n\n            Example: k*l=20, nl=3, n=3: \n                floor(20/3)=6, then floor(6/3)=2.\n                floor(20/(3*3))=floor(20/9)=2.\n\n            Example: k*l=19, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(19/3)=6, floor(6/3)=2.\n                floor(19/9)=2.\n\n            Example: k*l=17, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(17/3)=5, floor(5/3)=1.\n                floor(17/9)=1.\n\n            Example: k*l=18, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(18/3)=6, floor(6/3)=2.\n                floor(18/9)=2.\n\n            Example: k*l=21, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(21/3)=7, floor(7/3)=2.\n                floor(21/9)=2.\n\n            Example: k*l=22, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(22/3)=7, floor(7/3)=2.\n                floor(22/9)=2.\n\n            Example: k*l=23, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(23/3)=7, floor(7/3)=2.\n                floor(23/9)=2.\n\n            Example: k*l=24, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(24/3)=8, floor(8/3)=2.\n                floor(24/9)=2.\n\n            Example: k*l=25, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(25/3)=8, floor(8/3)=2.\n                floor(25/9)=2.\n\n            Example: k*l=26, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(26/3)=8, floor(8/3)=2.\n                floor(26/9)=2.\n\n            Example: k*l=27, nl=3, n=3:\n                floor(27/3)=9, floor(9/3)=3.\n                floor(27/9)=3.\n\n            So it holds.\n\n            Why?

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to ensure that all friends drink the same amount, which means the total number of toasts must be divisible by the number of friends. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts that can be made based on three resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of each resource, and the total resources must be sufficient to support an equal number of toasts for all friends.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution involves computing the maximum number of toasts per friend by considering each resource separately and then taking the minimum of these values. For each resource, the maximum number of toasts per friend is derived by dividing the total available resource by the number of friends and the required amount per toast (for drink and salt) or simply by the number of friends (for lime slices).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves straightforward arithmetic operations:\n   - Calculate the maximum toasts from the drink: `(k * l) // (n * nl)`\n   - Calculate the maximum toasts from the lime slices: `(c * d) // n`\n   - Calculate the maximum toasts from the salt: `p // (n * np)`\n   - The answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    t1 = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    t2 = (c * d) // n\n    t3 = p // (n * np)\n    \n    ans = min(t1, t2, t3)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast, respectively.\n2. **Calculating Toasts per Friend**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `nl` milliliters, and each friend can have `t` toasts. Thus, the maximum `t` is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Each toast requires one lime slice. The total slices available are `c * d`. With `n` friends, each can have up to `(c * d) // n` toasts.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Each toast requires `np` grams of salt. The total salt available is `p` grams. Thus, each friend can have up to `p // (n * np)` toasts.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the minimum of the three calculated values, ensuring that no resource is exceeded and all friends can partake equally.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal.",
