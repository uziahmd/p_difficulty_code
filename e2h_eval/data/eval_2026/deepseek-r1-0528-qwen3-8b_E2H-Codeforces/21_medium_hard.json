The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j is odd => (a_i % 2) != (b_j % 2)\n Therefore, we can separate the chests and keys by parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chestes_even = number of chests with even a_i\n   Chestes_odd = number of chests with odd a_i\n\n Similarly for keys:\n   Keys_even = number of keys with even b_j\n   Keys_odd = number of keys with odd b_j\n\n Now, note that an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\n So, we have two bipartite graphs:\n   - Even chests can be matched with odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be matched with even keys.\n\n But note: we cannot use a key twice. So the maximum matching from even chests to odd keys is limited by the minimum of:\n     min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n\n Similarly, the maximum matching from odd chests to even keys is limited by:\n     min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n\n However, wait: is that all? Actually, yes, because each chest must be matched by a key of opposite parity and vice versa.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we use all available keys or chests. We are just to maximize the number of chests opened.\n\n However, we must also consider that we cannot use the same key twice. The above two matchings are independent? Actually, they are independent in the sense that:\n\n   - We are matching even chests with odd keys (so the odd keys used here cannot be used for odd chests, because odd chests require even keys)\n   - Similarly, we are matching odd chests with even keys.\n\n So the total chests we can open is:\n   total = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n\n However, let's test with the example:\n\n Example 1:\n   Input: n=5, m=4, chests = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11], keys = [8,4,7,20]\n\n   Chests: \n        9 -> odd\n        14 -> even\n        6 -> even\n        2 -> even\n        11 -> odd\n\n        Chestes_even = 3, Chestes_odd = 2\n\n   Keys:\n        8 -> even\n        4 -> even\n        7 -> odd\n        20 -> even\n\n        Keys_even = 3, Keys_odd = 1\n\n   Then, according to our formula:\n        Even chests (3) can use odd keys (1) -> min(3,1) = 1\n        Odd chests (2) can use even keys (3) -> min(2,3) = 2\n        Total = 1+2 = 3 -> which matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input: n=5, m=1, chests = [2,4,6,8,10] (all even), keys = [5] (odd)\n\n        Chestes_even = 5, Chestes_odd = 0\n        Keys_even = 0, Keys_odd = 1\n\n        total = min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1+0 = 1 -> correct.\n\n Example 3:\n   Input: n=1, m=4, chests=[10] (even), keys=[20,30,40,50] (all even)\n\n        Chestes_even = 1, Chestes_odd = 0\n        Keys_even = 4, Keys_odd = 0\n\n        total = min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0+0 = 0 -> correct.\n\n Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n Steps:\n   Read n and m.\n   Read the list of chests.\n   Read the list of keys.\n\n   Count the number of even and odd numbers in the chests and keys.\n\n   Then, result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n   Print the result.\n\n However, note: the problem says the numbers are up to 10^9, but that doesn't matter because we are only checking parity.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n But wait: what if we have more than one way to assign? Actually, we don't need to assign in any particular way because the matching is complete as long as the counts are within the limits. Since we are only counting the maximum possible from two independent groups, it is correct.\n\n However, note: we cannot use the same key twice, but we are not using the same key for two different types. In fact, we are splitting the keys: odd keys for even chests and even keys for odd chests. And similarly for the chests. There is no overlap.\n\n So the answer is:\n\n   result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n Note: We must read the inputs from stdin.\n\n Example input format:\n\n   First line: \"5 4\"\n   Second line: \"9 14 6 2 11\"\n   Third line: \"8 4 7 20\"\n\n We'll split the lines and convert to integers.\n\n Code:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to the condition that an even-numbered chest must be opened by an odd-numbered key, and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys based on parity (even or odd). The solution hinges on counting how many chests and keys are even or odd.\n2. **Intuition**: An even-numbered chest can only be opened by an odd-numbered key, and an odd-numbered chest can only be opened by an even-numbered key. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum between the count of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum between the count of odd chests and even keys.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Counting the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Counting the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Calculating the maximum possible matches for even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple counting operations, which run in O(n + m) time, where n and m are the number of chests and keys, respectively. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n2. **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests and keys are even or odd by checking each number's parity.\n3. **Calculating Matches**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by taking the minimum of even chests and odd keys for one scenario, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys for the other scenario. The sum of these minima gives the answer.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, representing the maximum number of chests Neko can open under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple arithmetic to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
