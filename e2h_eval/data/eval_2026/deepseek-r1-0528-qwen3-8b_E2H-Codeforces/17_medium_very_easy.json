He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1.\n Steps:\n 1. Read the integer n.\n 2. Read the next 2n-2 lines (each string).\n 3. We know that for each length L (from 1 to n-1) there are two strings: one which is a prefix and one which is a suffix of the hidden string.\n\n However, note: the problem does not tell us which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes. But we know that the entire set of prefixes and suffixes (for lengths 1 to n-1) must be consistent with some string of length n.\n\n Observation:\n Since the hidden string s has length n, then:\n   - The prefixes are: s[0:1], s[0:2], ..., s[0:n-1]\n   - The suffixes are: s[1:n], s[2:n], ..., s[n-1:n] (i.e., starting at index 1, 2, ... n-1)\n\n But note: the problem states that there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1.\n\n How to assign?\n We cannot simply assign arbitrarily because the assignment must be consistent.\n\n Idea:\n Let's denote the hidden string as x (which we don't know). Then the prefixes are x[0:k] for k in [1, n-1] and the suffixes are x[i:] for i in [1, n] (so the suffixes have length from 1 to n-1).\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\"\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider: The entire set of 2n-2 strings must include the first n-1 characters (as prefixes) and the last n-1 characters (as suffixes). But note that the prefix of length 1 is the first character, and the suffix of length 1 is the last character.\n\n Moreover, note that the prefix of length k must end at the same position as the suffix of length n-k? Actually, consider:\n\n Let s = x0 x1 x2 ... x_{n-1}\n\n Then the prefixes are:\n   P1 = x0\n   P2 = x0x1\n   ...\n   P_{n-1} = x0x1...x_{n-2}\n\n The suffixes are:\n   S1 = x_{n-1}\n   S2 = x_{n-2}x_{n-1}\n   ...\n   S_{n-1} = x1x2...x_{n-1}\n\n Now, note that the prefix of length k is the substring from index0 to index k-1, and the suffix of length k is the substring from index n-k to index n-1.\n\n Also note: The set of given strings includes two strings of length 1, two of length 2, etc.\n\n However, we can use the following:\n\n Consider the two strings of length 1: one is the first character (prefix) and the other is the last character (suffix). Similarly, for length 2: the prefix of length 2 is the first two characters, and the suffix of length 2 is the last two characters.\n\n But wait: what if the two strings of a given length are the same? The example input \"3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na\" shows that there can be duplicates.\n\n However, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n.\" and \"exactly 2 strings of each length from 1 to n-1\".\n\n So for length 1, we have two strings. One of them must be the first character (prefix) and the other must be the last character (suffix). Similarly for length 2, etc.\n\n But note: the entire set of 2n-2 strings must be split into two sets of n-1: one for prefixes and one for suffixes.\n\n How can we decide?\n\n We know that the prefix set must form a sequence such that the prefix of length k is a prefix of the prefix of length k+1. Similarly, the suffix set must form a sequence such that the suffix of length k is a suffix of the suffix of length k+1 (if we consider the suffixes in reverse order).\n\n However, we don't know which is which.\n\n Another idea: the entire string s must have the property that the prefix of length k and the suffix of length k must share an overlap condition? Actually, they don't necessarily have to be related by the same letter.\n\n But note: the prefix of length k is s[0:k] and the suffix of length k is s[n-k:n]. There is no direct relation between these two, except that they are part of the same string.\n\n However, we can use the fact that the two sets (prefixes and suffixes) must be consistent with a common string of length n.\n\n Since the problem allows any valid answer, we can try to assign the two strings of the same length arbitrarily as long as the entire set of prefixes and suffixes can form a string.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the i-th character of this string should be 'P' if the i-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise\". However, we don't know the original order of the input.\n\n Wait, the input gives 2n-2 lines. We must output a string of length 2n-2 (with characters 'P' and 'S') and the i-th character corresponds to the i-th input string.\n\n So we have to assign each of the 2n-2 strings as either a prefix or a suffix.\n\n Constraints for consistency:\n   - The set of prefixes must be exactly the set { s[0:1], s[0:2], ..., s[0:n-1] }\n   - The set of suffixes must be exactly { s[1:n], s[2:n], ..., s[n-1:n] }\n\n And the entire string s must be of length n.\n\n How to assign without knowing s?\n\n Alternative Insight:\n\n Since there are exactly two strings for each length, we can group the strings by their length.\n\n For a fixed length L (from 1 to n-1), we have two strings. One of these must be a prefix and one a suffix.\n\n But note: the prefix of length L is the first L characters, and the suffix of length L is the last L characters.\n\n Now, consider the entire string s. The prefix of length L is s[0:L] and the suffix of length L is s[n-L:n].\n\n The condition for the entire string is that the two parts must match at the overlapping part? Actually, the entire string is of length n, so the two parts (the prefix of length L and the suffix of length L) might not overlap. However, if we consider the whole string, then the prefix of length L must end at index L-1 and the suffix of length L must start at index n-L (which is at least 1, so they don't necessarily overlap).\n\n But here is an important observation: the two strings of the same length must be distinct? Not necessarily: the example input \"3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na\" has two 'a' and two 'aa'. However, the two 'a' are of length 1 and two 'aa' are of length 2.\n\n However, note: the two strings of the same length might be the same. For example, if the hidden string is \"aaa\", then the prefixes are \"a\", \"aa\", and the suffixes are \"a\", \"aa\". So the two strings of length 1 are both \"a\", and the two strings of length 2 are both \"aa\".\n\n Therefore, we cannot assume distinctness.\n\n So we have to consider:\n\n For each length L, we have two strings (possibly equal). We must assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n However, the entire string s must be consistent. That means:\n\n   Let P_L = the chosen prefix of length L, and S_L = the chosen suffix of length L.\n\n Then the entire string s must satisfy:\n   s[0:L] = P_L\n   s[n-L:n] = S_L\n\n And also, the prefixes must be consistent: the prefix of length L must be the prefix of length L+1 for the first L characters, and similarly the suffixes must be consistent: the suffix of length L must be the suffix of length L+1 for the last L characters.\n\n But note: the prefix of length L+1 is s[0:L+1] and the suffix of length L+1 is s[n-L-1:n]. \n\n However, we don't know s. But we can check the consistency of the assignment for the entire set.\n\n Since n is at most 100, but the total number of strings is 2n-2 (at most 198) and n-1=99, we cannot iterate over all possibilities (which would be 2^(2n-2)).\n\n We need a smarter way.\n\n Observation:\n\n Consider the two strings of length 1. Let them be A and B. Then the first character is either A or B, and the last character is the other one.\n\n Similarly, consider the two strings of length 2. Let them be C and D. Then the first two characters are one of them, and the last two characters are the other.\n\n Now, note: the entire string s must have the first two characters and the last two characters. Also, the third character (if n>=3) is determined by the prefix of length 3? Actually, we don't know.\n\n However, we can use the fact that the prefix of length 1 and the prefix of length 2 must agree on the first character. Similarly, the suffix of length 1 and the suffix of length 2 must agree on the last character.\n\n So for a given length L, we have two candidates: let's say the two strings are X and Y.\n\n We must assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n How to choose? We can consider the following:\n\n   If we assign X as a prefix and Y as a suffix, then we must check consistency with the already assigned ones.\n\n But we don't know the entire assignment until we assign all lengths.\n\n Alternatively, we can build the entire string s from the prefix set and the suffix set.\n\n However, we are allowed to output any valid assignment.\n\n Another idea:\n\n Since the problem is symmetric in the sense that multiple answers are accepted, we can try to assign the two strings of each length arbitrarily, but ensuring that the prefixes form a chain (each prefix is the previous prefix extended by one character) and the suffixes form a chain (each suffix is the next suffix extended by one character at the beginning). But wait, the suffixes: the suffix of length L is s[n-L:n], and the suffix of length L+1 is s[n-L-1:n] which is the suffix of length L+1. They are related by: the suffix of length L+1 is the suffix of length L with an extra character at the beginning.\n\n Therefore, the set of suffixes must be such that if we take the two strings for each length and assign one as prefix and one as suffix, then the suffixes must form a sequence where the suffix of length L is the suffix of length L+1 without its first character.\n\n But note: we have two strings for each length, and we don't know which is which.\n\n However, we can do:\n\n   Group by length.\n\n   For each length L from 1 to n-1, we have two strings: let's call them A and B.\n\n   Now, consider the two possibilities for the next length L+1: two strings C and D.\n\n   The suffix of length L must be the last L characters of the suffix of length L+1.\n\n   So if we assume that the suffix of length L+1 is D, then the suffix of length L must be D[1:]. But we only have two possibilities for length L: A and B.\n\n   Therefore, if D[1:] is one of A or B, then we can assign the suffix of length L accordingly.\n\n   Similarly, the prefix of length L must be the prefix of the prefix of length L+1.\n\n   But note: we are assigning independently for each length, and the entire string must be consistent.\n\n However, the problem does not require us to recover the string, only to assign each input string as either 'P' or 'S'.\n\n We can try to assign from the longest to the shortest? Or from the shortest to the longest.\n\n Since the constraints are small (n<=100, but the total number of strings is 2n-2, so 198 maximum) and the structure is fixed, we can use the following:\n\n   Step 1: Group the strings by their lengths.\n\n   Step 2: For each length L from 1 to n-1, we have two strings.\n\n   Step 3: We need to assign one of them as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n   Step 4: The entire assignment must be consistent. How?\n\n        Let F(L) be the prefix of length L, and G(L) be the suffix of length L.\n\n        Then, the prefix of length L must be the prefix of the prefix of length L+1 (if we consider the entire string) only in the sense that the first L characters of the prefix of length L+1 is the prefix of length L. But note: the prefix of length L+1 is given, and the prefix of length L must be its prefix. However, the problem doesn't give the entire string, so we don't have the full string.\n\n        Actually, we don't have the full string. We have to ensure that the set of prefixes and suffixes are the ones that appear in the string.\n\n        But note: the hidden string s must be such that:\n          s[0:L] = F(L)   for each L from 1 to n-1\n          s[L:n] for the suffix of length n-L? Actually, the suffix of length L is s[n-L:n] = G(L).\n\n        Then, the entire string s must be F(n-1) (which is the prefix of length n-1) and then the last character must be the same as the last character of the suffix of length n-1? Actually, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0:n-1] and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:n]. Then s[0:n-1] and s[1:n] must be consistent: the second part of the prefix (the last n-2 characters) must equal the first n-2 characters of the suffix.\n\n        In other words: \n          s[0:n-1] = F(n-1)\n          s[1:n] = G(n-1)\n\n        Then we must have F(n-1)[1:] == G(n-1)[0:n-2]\n\n        But wait, we don't know which one is the prefix and which one is the suffix for length n-1.\n\n        Actually, we have two possibilities for length n-1: one is the prefix and one is the suffix.\n\n        So we have to assign the two strings for length n-1: one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n        Then, the entire string s would be: \n          s = F(n-1) + (last character) but also s = (first character) + ... + G(n-1)\n\n        Specifically, if we fix:\n          F(n-1) = the prefix of length n-1, then the first n-1 characters are F(n-1).\n          G(n-1) = the suffix of length n-1, then the last n-1 characters are G(n-1).\n\n        Then the entire string s must be F(n-1) + G(n-1)[-1] (because the last character is the last character of G(n-1)), but also the first character is F(n-1)[0] and the second to the n-1-th character is F(n-1)[1:].\n\n        But note: the suffix of length n-1 is the substring from index1 to index n-1 (0-indexed) of the entire string. The entire string is of length n, so:\n\n          s = [F(n-1)] + [G(n-1)[-1]]   -> but then the suffix of length n-1 would be s[1:n] = F(n-1)[1:] + G(n-1)[-1]\n\n        However, we are given G(n-1). So we must have:\n\n          F(n-1)[1:] + G(n-1)[-1] = G(n-1)\n\n        But note: G(n-1) is of length n-1, and F(n-1)[1:] is of length n-2, so the above equation requires:\n\n          G(n-1) = F(n-1)[1:] + (one character) and that one character is the last character of the entire string.\n\n        Actually, the entire string s is of length n, so we can write:\n\n          s = F(n-1) + (last char) = F(n-1) + G(n-1)[-1]\n\n        Then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:n] = F(n-1)[1:] + G(n-1)[-1]\n\n        But note: G(n-1) is given and we are assuming it is the suffix of length n-1. Therefore, we must have:\n\n          F(n-1)[1:] + G(n-1)[-1] = G(n-1)\n\n        This implies: \n          F(n-1)[1:] = G(n-1)[0:n-2]   and the last character of G(n-1) is the last character of s, but we don't use that to compare.\n\n        However, note: we have two possibilities for the assignment for length n-1. We can choose which one is the prefix and which one is the suffix.\n\n        So for length n-1, we have two strings: let's say X and Y.\n\n        Possibility 1: \n            F(n-1) = X, G(n-1) = Y.\n            Then we require: X[1:] == Y[0:n-2]   (because Y is of length n-1, so Y[0:n-2] is the first n-2 characters)\n\n        Possibility 2:\n            F(n-1) = Y, G(n-1) = X.\n            Then we require: Y[1:] == X[0:n-2]\n\n        Exactly one of these two possibilities must hold (since the string exists). So we can use this condition to assign the two strings for length n-1.\n\n        Then, once we assign the two strings for length n-1, we can use similar conditions for shorter lengths.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require us to recover the string, but to assign each of the 2n-2 input strings as either 'P' or 'S'. And the assignment must be such that the entire set is consistent.\n\n        But wait: the condition above only uses the two strings of the maximum length (n-1). What about the other lengths?\n\n        We must ensure that the entire assignment is consistent. For example, the prefix of length 1 must be the first character of the prefix of length n-1, and similarly the suffix of length 1 must be the last character of the suffix of length n-1.\n\n        However, we can use the following:\n\n          Let's assign the two strings of length n-1 as above (using the condition that the suffix of length n-1 is the prefix of length n-1 without its first character and then adding the last character, but actually the condition is that the suffix of length n-1 is the prefix of length n-1 without the first character plus the last character? Actually, we derived:\n\n            Condition: F(n-1)[1:] == G(n-1)[0:n-2]\n\n          Then, the entire string s is: F(n-1) + G(n-1)[-1] (but note: the last character is the last character of G(n-1), and the entire string must be of length n, so we don't need to append anything because F(n-1) is of length n-1, and we add one more character? Actually, no: the entire string is of length n, so we have:\n\n            s = F(n-1) + (character) but the character is the last character of s, which is the last character of G(n-1). However, note: the prefix F(n-1) is the first n-1 characters, and the last character is the last character of G(n-1). But then the entire string is F(n-1) + G(n-1)[-1] and that string has length n.\n\n          Now, we can use the entire string s to check the other lengths.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Group the strings by length.\n\n          Step 2: Start from the maximum length (n-1) and assign the two strings as prefix and suffix by checking the condition above.\n\n          Step 3: Then, for the next length (n-2), we have two strings. We know that the prefix of length n-1 is F(n-1) and the suffix of length n-1 is G(n-1). Now, the entire string s is F(n-1) + G(n-1)[-1] (which is of length n).\n\n          Then, the prefix of length n-2 must be the first n-2 characters of F(n-1). Similarly, the suffix of length n-2 must be the last n-2 characters of G(n-1) (or the last n-2 characters of s, which is the same as the last n-2 characters of G(n-1) because the entire string is F(n-1) + G(n-1)[-1], so the last n-2 characters are the last n-1 characters of s without the first character? Actually, the entire string is:\n\n            s = [F(n-1)] + [G(n-1)[-1]]\n\n            But note: F(n-1) is the first n-1 characters, and then we add the last character (from the suffix of length n-1). However, the entire string must be consistent with the given set.\n\n          Actually, we have the entire string s. Then for a given length L, the prefix of length L must be s[0:L] and the suffix of length L must be s[n-L:n].\n\n          So we can reconstruct the entire string from the assignment of the two strings of length n-1, and then check the other lengths.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it.\"\n\n        So we don't necessarily need to recover the string. We just need to assign the two strings for each length as either prefix or suffix.\n\n        But note: the assignment must be consistent for the entire set. The condition we used for length n-1 is necessary. For the other lengths, we can assign arbitrarily as long as the entire set of prefixes (when taken together) and the entire set of suffixes (when taken together) are consistent with the entire string s.\n\n        Since we have the entire string s from the two strings of length n-1, we can then check the other lengths.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Read n and the list of strings.\n\n          2. Group the strings by length. We'll have a dictionary: key = length, value = list of two strings (or possibly two same strings).\n\n          3. Start from length = n-1 (the largest) and assign the two strings as prefix and suffix based on the condition:\n\n                Option 1: \n                    prefix = string1, suffix = string2\n                    Condition: prefix[1:] == suffix[:-1]   [because the suffix of length n-1 is the entire string without the first character? Actually, the entire string is of length n, and the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters, which is the entire string without the first character.\n\n                But wait: the entire string s is built from the prefix of length n-1 (which is the first n-1 characters) and the last character is the last character of the suffix of length n-1.\n\n                Actually, the entire string is: \n                  s = prefix_of_length_n-1 + (last character from the suffix_of_length_n-1)\n\n                And the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s, which is the entire string without the first character.\n\n                So condition: \n                  s = prefix_of_length_n-1 + (last_char) \n                  and s without the first character is the suffix_of_length_n-1.\n\n                Then, the condition is: \n                  suffix_of_length_n-1 = s[1:] = (prefix_of_length_n-1 + last_char)[1:] = prefix_of_length_n-1[1:] + last_char\n\n                But note: the suffix_of_length_n-1 is given and must equal that.\n\n                However, we don't know the last_char. But note: the suffix_of_length_n-1 is given and we know its last character is the last_char.\n\n                So condition: \n                  prefix_of_length_n-1[1:] + suffix_of_length_n-1[-1] == suffix_of_length_n-1   [but wait, the entire suffix_of_length_n-1 is given, so we don't need to check the last character separately? Actually, we have:\n\n                  We require: \n                    prefix_of_length_n-1[1:] == suffix_of_length_n-1[:-1]\n\n                So we can check: \n                  Option 1: string1 is prefix, string2 is suffix -> then string1[1:] == string2[:-1]?\n                  Option 2: string2 is prefix, string1 is suffix -> then string2[1:] == string1[:-1]?\n\n                We choose the option that satisfies the condition.\n\n          4. Once we assign the two strings for length n-1, we can compute the entire string s.\n\n          5. Then, for each length L from 1 to n-2 (in increasing order, but actually we can do decreasing to ensure consistency) we can check:\n\n                The prefix of length L must be the first L characters of the entire string s.\n                The suffix of length L must be the last L characters of s.\n\n          6. But note: the two strings for length L are given. We must assign one as prefix and one as suffix. We can check:\n\n                candidate1: \n                    prefix_candidate = the string that matches s[0:L]\n                    then the suffix_candidate must be the other string, and we check if s[n-L:n] == suffix_candidate.\n\n                But wait: we have two strings for length L: let them be A and B.\n\n                We can check:\n                    If s[0:L] is A, then the prefix should be A and the suffix should be B. Then we check if s[n-L:n] == B.\n                    Or if s[0:L] is B, then the prefix should be B and the suffix should be A. Then we check if s[n-L:n] == A.\n\n                However, note: it is guaranteed that the set is the set of prefixes and suffixes of some string of length n. Therefore, one of these two assignments must be correct.\n\n          7. But wait: we have built s from the two strings of length n-1. Then the entire string s is fixed. Then we can assign the remaining strings by comparing to s.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the two strings for a given length L might not appear in s? Actually, they must, because they are the prefixes and suffixes.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length n\".\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          Step 1: Group the input by length.\n\n          Step 2: For length = n-1, assign the two strings as prefix and suffix by the condition above (using the condition on the substring).\n\n          Step 3: Build the entire string s: s = prefix_string + suffix_string[-1]   [but wait, we have two strings for length n-1: one is the prefix (of length n-1) and the other is the suffix (of length n-1). The entire string is then: \n                  s = prefix_string (which is the first n-1 characters) + (the last character of the suffix_string)   [because the entire string has length n, and the last character is the last character of the suffix_string].\n\n          However, note: the suffix_string is the last n-1 characters, so the entire string is the first n-1 characters (prefix_string) and then the last character is the last character of the suffix_string. So:\n\n                  s = prefix_string + suffix_string[-1]\n\n          But wait: the prefix_string is of length n-1, and the suffix_string is of length n-1, so the entire string is:\n\n                  s = prefix_string + (suffix_string[-1])\n\n          Then the suffix_string should be s[1:] = (prefix_string + suffix_string[-1])[1:] = prefix_string[1:] + suffix_string[-1]\n\n          And that must equal the given suffix_string. So our condition was:\n\n                  prefix_string[1:] + suffix_string[-1] == suffix_string\n\n          But note: the condition we checked was prefix_string[1:] == suffix_string[:-1] (which is equivalent to the above).\n\n          Step 4: Then for each length L from 1 to n-2 (in increasing order, because we want to use the entire string s to check the prefixes and suffixes):\n\n                  We have two strings for length L: A and B.\n\n                  Check if s[0:L] is A. Then assign A as prefix and B as suffix, and mark them accordingly.\n\n                  Otherwise, if s[0:L] is B, then assign B as prefix and A as suffix.\n\n                  But wait: what if neither A nor B is s[0:L]? Then there is a problem, but the guarantee says they are the prefixes and suffixes of some string. However, note: the entire string s is built from the assignment for n-1, and the set of prefixes and suffixes must be the given set. Therefore, one of A or B must be the prefix of length L (which is s[0:L]) and the other must be the suffix of length L (which is s[n-L:n]).\n\n          Step 5: But note: we are not told which string is which, and we are building s from the n-1 case. Then for the other lengths, we can use s to check.\n\n        However, there is a possibility: the two strings for a given length L might be the same. Then we have two identical strings. Then we must assign one as prefix and one as suffix, but if s[0:L] is that string, then the other occurrence must be the suffix? But wait, if the two strings are the same, then we have two identical strings. Then the condition for the prefix and suffix of length L is the same.\n\n        Example: the string \"aaa\", n=3, then for length 1: two 'a'; for length 2: two 'aa'.\n\n        Then for length 2 (n-1=2): \n            We have two strings: ['aa', 'aa'].\n\n            Condition for Option1: \n                prefix = 'aa', suffix = 'aa'\n                Condition: 'aa'[1:] == 'aa'[:-1] -> 'a' == 'a' -> True.\n\n            Then we assign one 'aa' as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\n            Then the entire string s = 'aa' + 'aa'[-1] = 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'\n\n            Then for length 1: two strings: ['a','a'].\n\n            Then we check: \n                s[0:1] = 'a', which is one of the two. Then we assign one 'a' as prefix and the other 'a' as suffix.\n\n            The assignment for the two 'a' is arbitrary, but the condition holds.\n\n        However, note: the two 'a' are given twice. We have to mark both as either 'P' or 'S'. But wait, we have two identical strings. How do we assign?\n\n        The problem says: \"Print one string of length 2n-2 — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'.\" and the i-th character is 'P' if the i-th input string is the prefix, and 'S' otherwise.\n\n        Since the input has two 'a' for n=3, we have to assign one as 'P' and one as 'S'. But which one? The problem says \"If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\"\n\n        However, we must assign one of the two 'a' as prefix and the other as suffix. But note: the entire string s is 'aaa'. The prefix of length 1 is 'a' and the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So both are 'a'. Then we have to assign one occurrence as 'P' and the other as 'S'. \n\n        But wait: the input order matters. We are given 2n-2 lines. We have to output a string of the same order.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We must remember the order of the input.\n\n        Revised plan:\n\n          We cannot group by length and lose the order. We have to assign each input string (in the given order) as either 'P' or 'S'.\n\n          We know the entire string s from the assignment for length n-1.\n\n          Then, for each string (in the input order) we check:\n\n            Let the string be t.\n\n            Then, if t is a prefix (i.e., t == s[0:len(t)]), then we mark it as 'P'. Otherwise, if t is a suffix (t == s[len(s)-len(t):]), then we mark it as 'S'. \n\n          But wait: what if a string is both a prefix and a suffix? Then we can assign it arbitrarily? Actually, the problem says: the set of given strings is exactly the set of proper prefixes and suffixes. So each string must be either a prefix or a suffix, but not necessarily both.\n\n          However, note: the set of prefixes and suffixes are defined by the entire string s. So for a given string t of length L, it is either the prefix of length L (s[0:L]) or the suffix of length L (s[n-L:n]). It cannot be both unless s[0:L] == s[n-L:n].\n\n          But the problem says: the set of given strings is the set of proper prefixes and suffixes (so two per length). And the string s is of length n.\n\n          Example: n=3, s=\"aba\": \n            prefixes: \"a\", \"ab\"\n            suffixes: \"a\", \"ba\"\n\n          Then the two strings of length 1: ['a','a'] -> but wait, the two strings of length 1 are 'a' and 'a'? Actually, no: the two strings of length 1 are the prefix of length1 and the suffix of length1. The prefix of length1 is 'a', the suffix of length1 is 'a'. So we have two 'a'. \n\n          Then the two strings of length 2: the prefix is \"ab\", the suffix is \"ba\".\n\n          Now, in the input, we have two 'a' and one 'ab' and one 'ba'. But wait, the input has 2n-2=4 strings. So we have two strings of length1 and two of length2.\n\n          However, the example input \"3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na\" has four strings: two of length1 and two of length2, but the two of length1 are both 'a' and the two of length2 are both 'aa'. \n\n          Therefore, we must account for duplicates.\n\n          How to handle duplicates?\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Step 1: Read the input and store each string along with its index (to preserve order).\n\n            Step 2: Group by length, but keep the index.\n\n            Step 3: Process the groups from length n-1 down to 1.\n\n            For the group of length n-1:\n\n                We have two strings (with indices i and j). We check the two possibilities:\n\n                    Possibility 1: \n                        prefix = string_i, suffix = string_j\n                        Condition: string_i[1:] == string_j[:-1]\n\n                    Possibility 2:\n                        prefix = string_j, suffix = string_i\n                        Condition: string_j[1:] == string_i[:-1]\n\n                Choose the possibility that holds.\n\n            Then, the entire string s = string_i (if chosen as prefix) + string_j[-1] (if string_j is the suffix) OR the other way.\n\n            Actually, we have two cases:\n\n                Case 1: Condition1 holds -> then we assign string_i as prefix and string_j as suffix.\n\n                Then s = string_i + string_j[-1]\n\n                Case 2: Condition2 holds -> then we assign string_j as prefix and string_i as suffix.\n\n                Then s = string_j + string_i[-1]\n\n            Then, we remove these two strings from the list and proceed to the next largest length (n-2).\n\n            For the next length (n-2):\n\n                We have two strings (with indices). We know the entire string s. Then we check:\n\n                    For a string t of length L = n-2:\n\n                    Check if t equals s[0:L] (then it is the prefix) or if t equals s[n-L:n] (then it is the suffix). But note: it must be one of these two.\n\n                However, what if both conditions hold? Then we have two possibilities. But the problem says there are exactly two strings per length, and the entire string s must have two strings: one for prefix and one for suffix.\n\n                But note: the two strings for length n-2 are given. We must assign one as prefix and one as suffix.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    Let the two strings be A and B.\n\n                    Check if A is the prefix (A == s[0:len(A)]) and B is the suffix",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string of length `n`. The solution involves grouping the strings by their lengths and then using the properties of prefixes and suffixes to assign each string to either 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Strings by Length**: First, we group all input strings by their lengths. Since the problem guarantees exactly two strings for each length from 1 to `n-1`, we can process these groups systematically.\n2. **Process Longest Length First**: Start with the longest strings (length `n-1`). For these strings, one must be a prefix and the other a suffix. The condition for this is that the longer string without its first character (for the prefix) must match the longer string without its last character (for the suffix). This helps us determine which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n3. **Reconstruct the Unknown String**: Once the longest strings are assigned, we can reconstruct the unknown string by combining the prefix of length `n-1` and the last character of the suffix of length `n-1`.\n4. **Assign Remaining Strings**: Using the reconstructed string, we then check the remaining strings (from length 1 to `n-2`) against the actual prefixes and suffixes derived from the reconstructed string. Each string is marked 'P' if it matches a prefix and 'S' if it matches a suffix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    strings = []\n    for i in range(1, 2*n - 1 + 1):\n        strings.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    group = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        l = len(s)\n        if l not in group:\n            group[l] = []\n        group[l].append(s)\n    \n    assignment = [''] * (2*n - 2)\n    index_map = {}\n    for idx, s in enumerate(strings):\n        index_map[s] = idx\n    \n    keys = sorted(group.keys(), reverse=True)\n    s_reconstructed = None\n    \n    for length in keys:\n        lst = group[length]\n        if len(lst) != 2:\n            continue\n        \n        a, b = lst\n        cond1 = (a[1:] == b[:-1])\n        cond2 = (b[1:] == a[:-1])\n        \n        if cond1:\n            prefix_str = a\n            suffix_str = b\n            s_reconstructed = prefix_str + suffix_str[-1]\n            pos1 = index_map[a]\n            pos2 = index_map[b]\n            assignment[pos1] = 'P'\n            assignment[pos2] = 'S'\n        elif cond2:\n            prefix_str = b\n            suffix_str = a\n            s_reconstructed = prefix_str + suffix_str[-1]\n            pos1 = index_map[b]\n            pos2 = index_map[a]\n            assignment[pos1] = 'P'\n            assignment[pos2] = 'S'\n        else:\n            pass\n            \n    for length in range(1, n-1):\n        lst = group[length]\n        for s in lst:\n            L = len(s)\n            if s_reconstructed.startswith(s):\n                idx = index_map[s]\n                assignment[idx] = 'P'\n            else:\n                if s_reconstructed.endswith(s):\n                    idx = index_map[s]\n                    assignment[idx] = 'S'\n    \n    result_string = ''.join(assignment)\n    print(result_string)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into individual strings. The first line is the length `n` of the unknown string, followed by `2n-2` strings.\n2. **Grouping by Length**: Strings are grouped into a dictionary where keys are lengths and values are lists of strings of that length.\n3. **Processing Longest Strings**: The longest strings (length `n-1`) are processed first. The condition checks if one string (without its first character) matches another string (without its last character). This determines which is the prefix and which is the suffix, allowing reconstruction of the unknown string.\n4. **Reconstructing the String**: The unknown string is built by appending the last character of the suffix string to the prefix string.\n5. **Assigning Remaining Strings**: For shorter strings, each is checked against the reconstructed string to see if it matches a prefix ('P') or suffix ('S'). The results are compiled into the output string.\n6. **Output**: The final output is a string of 'P's and 'S's indicating the assignment of each input string.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of prefixes and suffixes to determine their assignments, ensuring consistency with the reconstructed unknown string.",
