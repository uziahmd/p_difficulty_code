For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'] (12 notes)\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing the semitone index.\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we will consider all permutations of the three notes.\n 3. For each permutation [a, b, c] (which we can think as X, Y, Z), check two conditions:\n    - Condition for major: \n        distance from X to Y = 4 semitones, and from Y to Z = 3 semitones.\n        Then the total from X to Z is 7 semitones (but we don't need that explicitly).\n    - Condition for minor:\n        distance from X to Y = 3 semitones, and from Y to Z = 4 semitones.\n\n 4. However, because the musical scale is cyclic, we must consider the circular arrangement.\n\n Important: The distance from note A to note B is defined as (B - A) mod 12, but if negative we adjust by adding 12.\n\n But note: the problem states that the distance from E to C is 8 semitones (going up). However, in our mapping we have to account for the circularity.\n\n How to compute the distance between two notes?\n   Let base_notes = ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H']\n   Let note_to_index = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n   Then, the distance from note a to note b (ascending) is:\n        (index_b - index_a) % 12\n   But wait: if we go from E (index 4) to C (index 0): (0-4) % 12 = -4 % 12 = 8 (if we define modulo for negative: (x % 12 + 12) % 12). Alternatively, we can do:\n        distance = (index_b - index_a) % 12\n        But if negative, we add 12 until positive? Actually, we can use modulo arithmetic: \n        distance = (index_b - index_a) % 12   might give negative? So we do: \n        distance = (index_b - index_a) % 12\n        But if negative, we want the positive equivalent. In Python, negative modulo gives a result between 0 and 11? Actually, no: \n        Example: (0 - 4) % 12 -> (-4) % 12 = 8 (in Python, % returns non-negative). So yes, we can use:\n        dist = (index_b - index_a) % 12\n\n   However, note: the problem says the distance from E to C is 8. This matches.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we always go upward. However, in the example, E to C is going upward? Actually, the example says \"between E and C is 8 semitones\", but in reality, from E going up we hit F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C -> that's 8 semitones. However, when we have three notes, we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. So we are effectively looking for consecutive intervals.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    We have three notes: n1, n2, n3.\n\n    We'll map each note to an integer (0-11).\n\n    Then, we consider all 6 permutations (each note can be the starting point, then the next, then the last).\n\n    For a given permutation [a, b, c]:\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        Then the entire circle from a to c via b is d1+d2, but also the direct distance from a to c is (c - a) % 12, which should be (d1+d2) % 12, but note: we are only concerned with the two consecutive distances.\n\n    Conditions:\n        Major: d1 == 4 and d2 == 3   -> then the chord is major.\n        Minor: d1 == 3 and d2 == 4   -> then the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval requirements for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Semitones**: Each note is mapped to a corresponding integer value (0 to 11) representing its position in the 12-note chromatic scale.\n2. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, compute the intervals between consecutive notes (in semitones). \n3. **Interval Validation**: A major chord requires the intervals to be 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones. A minor chord requires the intervals to be 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones. If any permutation meets either condition, the chord is classified accordingly. If no permutation meets these conditions, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    base_notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(base_notes)}\n    \n    input_str = input().split()\n    notes = [note.strip() for note in input_str]\n    \n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n            \n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `base_notes` list defines the order of the 12 notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its corresponding semitone index.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their respective semitone indices.\n3. **Permutation Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all six possible orders of the three notes are generated. For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Chord Classification**: The intervals are checked against the major (4, 3) and minor (3, 4) chord criteria. If a major criterion is met without a minor one, the output is \"major\". Conversely, if a minor criterion is met without a major one, the output is \"minor\". If neither condition is met, the output is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the three notes to determine the chord type, ensuring correctness and completeness.",
