He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that the string only contains 'a','b','c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the problem statement, because A appended some 'b's and B appended some 'c's, but note: the problem says \"at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string\" after B appends the 'b's). However, note that C appends 'c's so the entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and possibly some 'c's.\n\n But note: the process is:\n   - A gives a string of some number of 'a's.\n   - B appends some number of 'b's (so now the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n   - C appends some number of 'c's, which is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (or both) in the entire string at the time he appends? \n\n However, note: when C appends, the string already has the initial 'a's and the appended 'b's. Then C appends a number of 'c's equal to the count of 'a' or the count of 'b' (in the string before appending the 'c's? Actually, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". \n\n But note: the string at the time of C's action includes the 'a's and the 'b's that were appended by B, and then C appends 'c's. So the condition for the number of 'c's is based on the entire string before C appends? Actually, the problem states:\n\n \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n Here, \"in the string\" — meaning the string that B gave to C (i.e., the string with the original 'a's and the appended 'b's). Because if we consider the entire string including the 'c's, then the count would change as we add more 'c's, and that doesn't make sense.\n\n Therefore, the counts for 'a' and 'b' are fixed (from the part before C appends). Then the total length of the string is:\n   n = (# of 'a') + (# of 'b') + (# of 'c')\n\n And the condition is: (# of 'c') must be either (# of 'a') or (# of 'b') [or both].\n\n However, there is also a condition on the order: the string must be such that the 'a's come first, then the 'b's, then the 'c's. Why?\n   - A gives a string of 'a's.\n   - B appends 'b's to the end.\n   - C appends 'c's to the end.\n\n So the string should be non-decreasing in terms of characters: all 'a's (if any) then all 'b's (if any) then all 'c's (if any). But note: what if there are no 'b's? The problem states that after B appends, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Therefore, we must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n Also, note: the condition on the number of 'c's applies to the entire string that B gave to C (which is the string without the 'c's). So let:\n   count_a = number of 'a' in the entire string (because the entire string is the same as the string B gave to C plus the appended 'c's? Actually, wait: the 'c's are appended at the end, so the counts of 'a' and 'b' do not change.\n\n Therefore, the entire string (after C) has:\n   total_c = number of 'c'\n\n And the condition is: total_c must be either equal to the number of 'a' (which is the same as in the string B gave, and remains) or equal to the number of 'b' (which is the same as in the string B gave).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check that the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. If not, then it's invalid (unless the string has no 'b'? Then we break the condition that B appended at least one 'b').\n\n 2. Check that the string is in non-decreasing order (i.e., all 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's). Because if we see a 'b' then an 'a' or a 'c' then a 'b' or 'a' etc., then it's not constructed by the process.\n\n 3. Let:\n        n_a = count of 'a'\n        n_b = count of 'b'\n        n_c = count of 'c'\n\n    Then the condition is: n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n But note: the problem says the string is given as a whole. We must ensure that the entire string is built by the process.\n\n However, note: the process requires that the 'a's are first, then the 'b's, then the 'c's. So we can check the order by ensuring that the string does not contain the substring 'b' followed by 'a' or 'c' followed by 'b' (except that we might have 'c' only at the end). Actually, we can traverse and check that the characters are non-decreasing.\n\n Example: \n   \"aaabccc\" -> valid order: 'a','a','a','a','b','c','c','c'? Wait, no: the example input is 'aaabccc'. \n   The example says: \n        Input: ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n   But note: the example input \"aabc\" is also valid. However, let me check the example:\n\n   Example 1: \"aaabccc\": \n        n_a = 4, n_b = 1, n_c = 3 -> 3 is not equal to 4, but wait! The condition says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. In this case, 3 is neither 4 nor 1. But the example output is \"YES\".\n\n   Wait, I must have misread the example. The example says: \"Consider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'.\" — but 3 != 4. \n\n   Let me read the example again: the example input is \"aaabccc\". \n        The string is: \n            a: 4, b: 1, c: 3.\n\n        The condition for C is: the number of 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' in the string (before appending the 'c's). \n\n   What was the string before C appends? The string given to C is \"aaab\", because C appends the 'c's. So in the string \"aaab\", we have:\n        n_a = 3 (because originally from A, but wait: the entire string from A was \"aaa\", then B appended one 'b'. Then C appends three 'c's. The condition says: the number of 'c' (which is 3) must be equal to the number of 'a' (which is 3) OR the number of 'b' (which is 1). \n\n   So the condition is satisfied because 3 equals the number of 'a' (which is 3) in the string \"aaab\" (the string that B gave to C). \n\n   Therefore, we must compute the counts of 'a' and 'b' from the part that is the original A and B's contributions (i.e., without the 'c's). But note: the entire string is built by the process. The condition is defined on the string that B gave to C, which is the string without the trailing 'c's.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify whether the 'c's are appended and then the entire string is given. But note: the problem says \"the string\" (meaning the one B gave) is the one with the 'a's and 'b's.\n\n   How can we know the boundary between the 'a' and 'b' part and the 'c' part? The process says that C appends to the end. Therefore, the string is divided into three segments: [all 'a's] [all 'b's] [all 'c's]. But note: the problem does not say that the entire string is only these three parts. However, the process is:\n\n      S = (some number of 'a's) + (some number of 'b's) + (some number of 'c's)\n\n   So the string must be composed of consecutive 'a's, then consecutive 'b's, then consecutive 'c's.\n\n   Therefore, we can:\n\n   Step 1: Check that the string is in non-decreasing order (each character is >= the previous one). Since the string only has 'a','b','c', we can check:\n\n        for i in range(1, len(s)):\n            if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n                then invalid\n\n   But note: the problem says the string is built by appending, so the order must be non-decreasing.\n\n   Step 2: Count the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the entire string.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the number of 'c' is based on the entire string that B gave (which is the original string without the 'c's). But wait, the original string from A and B is the entire string without the last (n_c) characters? \n\n   Actually, the entire string without the 'c's is the prefix until the last 'b'. But note: the string is built as:\n\n        [a...a][b...b][c...c]\n\n   So the part that B gave is the string from the beginning until the last non-'c' character. However, we don't know the boundary. But the order condition (Step 1) ensures that the 'c's only appear at the end.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think:\n\n        Let x = count of 'a' in the entire string (which is the same as in the B-given part)\n        Let y = count of 'b' in the entire string (same as in the B-given part)\n        Let z = count of 'c' in the entire string.\n\n        Condition: z must be either x or y.\n\n   But wait: the entire string's 'a' and 'b' counts are the same as the B-given part because the 'c's are appended and do not change the counts of 'a' and 'b'. \n\n   However, there's a catch: the example \"aaabccc\" has:\n        Entire string: \n            a: 4, b: 1, c: 3.\n\n        The B-given part is \"aaab\", so in the B-given part:\n            a: 3, b: 1.\n\n        Then C appends 3 'c's. The condition is: the number of 'c' (which is 3) must be equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the B-given part. In the B-given part, the number of 'a' is 3 and the number of 'b' is 1. So 3 is equal to the number of 'a' (3) in the B-given part, so condition holds.\n\n   Therefore, we must use the counts from the entire string for 'a' and 'b' (since the 'c's are not present in the B-given part) to represent the counts in the B-given part.\n\n   So:\n\n        Condition1: The string must be in non-decreasing order (only 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's).\n        Condition2: The number of 'c' must be either the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (from the entire string, which is the same as the B-given part).\n\n   Additionally, Condition0: The string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n   However, note: if the string is \"aaa\", then there's no 'b' -> invalid. Similarly, if the string is \"bb\", then no 'a' -> invalid.\n\n   But wait: the problem says that after B appends, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the B-given part must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Therefore, the entire string (which includes the 'c's) must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n   However, note that the entire string's 'a' count is the same as the B-given part's 'a' count (since we didn't remove any 'a') and similarly for 'b'. So the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n\n   But what if the string is \"a\"? Then the B-given part would be \"a\" (if no 'b' was appended) but the problem states that B appends some number of 'b's (at least one). So the B-given part must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Therefore, the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n   However, note: the entire string is the B-given part (with at least one 'a' and one 'b') plus the appended 'c's. So the entire string will have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n   Therefore, we can summarize:\n\n        Conditions:\n          1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n          2. The string must be in non-decreasing order (only 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's).\n          3. The number of 'c' must be equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (from the entire string, which is the same as the B-given part).\n\n   Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> \n        Condition1: has 'a' and 'b' -> yes.\n        Condition2: check order: \n            'a','a','a','a','b','c','c','c' -> non-decreasing -> yes.\n        Condition3: \n            count_a = 4, count_b = 1, count_c = 3 -> 3 == 4? No. 3 == 1? No. -> Condition3 fails.\n\n   But wait, the example output is \"YES\". \n\n   This indicates my reasoning about the condition3 is flawed.\n\n   Let me re-read the problem: \n        \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\"\n\n   Note: the word \"in the string\" — the string at the time of C's action. That string (the one B gave) is \"aaab\", which has:\n        number of 'a' = 3, number of 'b' = 1.\n\n   So the condition is: the number of 'c' appended (which is 3) must be equal to 3 or 1. It is 3, so condition holds.\n\n   How do we get the counts for the B-given part? \n\n   The B-given part is the entire string without the trailing 'c's? But note: the entire string is built by the process. However, the process does not require that the 'a's and 'b's are contiguous with the entire string? Actually, they are contiguous.\n\n   But note: the string might have been tampered with? No, we are to check if the given string can be obtained by the process.\n\n   How to extract the B-given part? \n\n   Since the process appends the 'c's at the end, the B-given part is the entire string up to the last non-'c' character. However, we know the entire string is built as [a...][b...][c...] so the B-given part is the entire string without the last (count_c) characters? Not exactly: because the B-given part ends with the last 'b'. The entire string is:\n\n        [a...a][b...b][c...c]\n\n   So the B-given part is the string from the beginning until the last occurrence of 'b'. But note: the 'c's are appended after the 'b's, so the B-given part is the entire string without the 'c's.\n\n   However, the problem does not say that the 'c's are the only ones at the end. But the process says: C appends to the end. So the entire string is:\n\n        [A's string (only 'a's)] + [B's appended 'b's] + [C's appended 'c's]\n\n   Therefore, the B-given part is the entire string without the last (number of 'c') characters.\n\n   But wait, the entire string's length is: n = n_a + n_b + n_c.\n\n   And the B-given part has length = n_a + n_b.\n\n   So we can compute the B-given part by taking the first (n_a + n_b) characters? But we don't know n_a and n_b until we count the entire string.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note: the entire string is built with three contiguous blocks. So the transition from 'a' to 'b' and then to 'c' is clean.\n\n   However, the condition for the number of 'c' is defined on the B-given part. So we need the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the B-given part.\n\n   But note: the entire string's 'a' and 'b' counts are the same as the B-given part's 'a' and 'b' counts, because the 'c's are appended and do not include any 'a' or 'b'.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the entire string's 'a' and 'b' counts for the condition.\n\n   However, wait: the example \"aaabccc\": \n        Entire string: \n            a: 4, b: 1, c: 3.\n\n        But the B-given part is \"aaab\", so in the B-given part:\n            a: 3, b: 1.\n\n        Then the condition is: 3 (appended 'c') must be equal to 3 (a in B-given) OR 1 (b in B-given). It is 3, so condition holds.\n\n   But the entire string's 'a' count is 4, which is different from the B-given part's 'a' count (3). \n\n   This means: the entire string's 'a' count is not the same as the B-given part's 'a' count?\n\n   Why? Because the entire string has an extra 'a' that was not in the B-given part? \n\n   Let me break down:\n\n        A gives a string of 'a's: say 4 'a's -> \"aaaa\"\n        Then B appends some 'b's: say 1 'b' -> \"aaaab\"\n        Then C appends 'c's: 3 'c's -> \"aaaabccc\"\n\n        But wait, the entire string is \"aaaabccc\", so the 'a' count is 4, the 'b' count is 1, and the 'c' count is 3.\n\n        The B-given part is \"aaaab\", so the 'a' count in the B-given part is 4 (not 3)? \n\n        Correction: the example in the problem says \"aaabccc\", meaning:\n\n            A gives \"aaa\" (three 'a's), then B appends one 'b' -> \"aaab\", then C appends three 'c's -> \"aaabccc\".\n\n        So the entire string's 'a' count is 3, not 4.\n\n        I made a mistake: the example input is \"aaabccc\", so the entire string has 3 'a's, 1 'b', and 3 'c's.\n\n        Then the condition is: the number of 'c' (3) must be equal to the number of 'a' (3) OR the number of 'b' (1). Since 3==3, it satisfies.\n\n        So in this example, the entire string's 'a' count is 3, which is the same as the B-given part's 'a' count (because the B-given part is \"aaab\", so 'a' count is 3).\n\n        Therefore, the entire string's 'a' and 'b' counts are the same as the B-given part's 'a' and 'b' counts.\n\n   Why? Because the 'c's are appended and do not change the counts of 'a' and 'b'. \n\n   So the condition is: the number of 'c' (total_c) must be equal to the entire string's 'a' (n_a) OR the entire string's 'b' (n_b).\n\n   Now, let's test the examples:\n\n   Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> n_a=3, n_b=1, n_c=3 -> 3==3 (condition holds) -> YES.\n\n   Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> \n        This string: 'b','b','a','c','c'\n        Condition1: Check order: \n            'b','b','a' -> here 'a' comes after 'b', which is decreasing -> invalid. So we output NO.\n\n   Example 3: \"aabc\" -> \n        n_a = 2, n_b = 1, n_c = 1 -> condition: 1==2? No. 1==1? Yes -> condition holds.\n        Check order: \n            'a','a','b','c' -> non-decreasing -> valid.\n\n   But wait, the example output is \"YES\", so \"aabc\" is valid.\n\n   However, note: the example input is \"aabc\", which is:\n\n        A gives \"aa\", then B appends one 'b' -> \"aab\", then C appends one 'c' -> \"aabc\".\n\n   The condition: the number of 'c' (1) must be equal to the number of 'a' (2) OR the number of 'b' (1). Since 1==1, condition holds.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Read the string S.\n\n        Step 2: Check that S contains at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. If not, print \"NO\".\n\n        Step 3: Check that the string is non-decreasing (each character is >= the previous one). We can do:\n\n            for i in range(1, len(S)):\n                if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n\n        Step 4: Count the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the entire string.\n\n            n_a = S.count('a')\n            n_b = S.count('b')\n            n_c = S.count('c')\n\n        Step 5: Check if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n            If yes, print \"YES\", else print \"NO\".\n\n   However, wait: what if the string has no 'c'? Then n_c=0, and we require 0==n_a or 0==n_b. But the problem says C appends some number of 'c's. The problem says \"some number\", which could be zero? \n\n   Let me check: the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", and \"some number\" usually implies at least one? But the problem also says \"It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of the 'a' and to the number of the 'b' at the same time.\" — but note, if the number of 'c' is zero, then the condition would require that the number of 'a' is 0 or the number of 'b' is 0. But we already require at least one 'a' and one 'b', so n_a>=1 and n_b>=1, so 0 cannot be equal to n_a or n_b (unless n_a=0 or n_b=0, which we already ruled out). \n\n   However, the problem does not explicitly say that C appends at least one 'c'. But note: the problem says \"appends some number\", and \"some number\" can be zero. But then the condition would be: the number of 'c' (0) must be equal to the number of 'a' (which is positive) or the number of 'b' (positive). Since 0 is not positive, condition fails. \n\n   But note: the problem says \"C appends some number\", and in many programming problems \"some\" implies at least one. However, the problem statement does not specify. But let's see the example: \n\n        The example inputs: \n            \"aaabccc\" -> has 3 c's, \n            \"bbacc\" -> invalid, \n            \"aabc\" -> has 1 c.\n\n   There is no example with zero 'c'. \n\n   According to the problem: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" — the word \"some\" in mathematics can mean \"at least one\", but sometimes it can mean \"an undetermined number\" (including zero). \n\n   However, the problem also says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". If C appends zero 'c's, then we require 0 == n_a or 0 == n_b. But we have at least one 'a' and one 'b', so n_a>=1 and n_b>=1, so 0 is not equal to either. \n\n   Therefore, if C appends zero 'c's, the condition fails. \n\n   But note: the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", and the process requires that the string is built by the three steps. The step for C is optional? Actually, the problem says \"He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' ... B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c'\". \n\n   The word \"some\" in the description of B and C's actions typically implies at least one. However, the problem does not explicitly state that the number must be positive. \n\n   But note the condition: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". If the number of 'c' is zero, then the condition requires that the number of 'a' is 0 or the number of 'b' is 0. But the problem states that after B appends, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Therefore, the condition for zero 'c' fails.\n\n   So we can assume that the string must have at least one 'c'? Not necessarily: because the problem says \"C appends\", and if C appends zero, then the string is the same as the B-given part. But the condition for C's appending is defined by the equation. So unless the B-given part has zero 'a' or zero 'b', which we know it doesn't, then we cannot have zero 'c'.\n\n   However, the problem does not say that the entire string must have at least one 'c'. But the condition forces that the number of 'c' is either n_a or n_b, and since n_a>=1 and n_b>=1, then the number of 'c' must be at least 1.\n\n   Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c' if the condition is to hold. But note: the problem says \"C appends\", so if the condition is to hold, then the number of 'c' must be positive. \n\n   However, what if the string has no 'c'? Then we already know from the condition that the condition fails, so we output \"NO\".\n\n   But wait, our Step 2: the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. It doesn't require 'c'. \n\n   Example: string \"aab\": \n        Condition0: has 'a' and 'b' -> valid.\n        Condition1: order: 'a','a','b' -> non-decreasing -> valid.\n        Condition2: n_c = 0, n_a=2, n_b=1 -> 0==2? No. 0==1? No -> invalid.\n\n   So we output \"NO\" for \"aab\".\n\n   Another example: \"abb\": \n        Condition0: has 'a' and 'b' -> valid.\n        Condition1: order: 'a','b','b' -> valid.\n        Condition2: n_c=0, n_a=1, n_b=2 -> 0==1? No. 0==2? No -> invalid.\n\n   So we output \"NO\".\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        Step 1: Read the string S.\n\n        Step 2: If the string does not contain at least one 'a' and at least one 'b', print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n        Step 3: Check the non-decreasing order. If not, print \"NO\" and exit.\n\n        Step 4: Count the numbers of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\n        Step 5: If the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b', then print \"YES\", else print \"NO\".\n\n   However, note: what if the string does not have any 'c'? Then the condition fails, which is handled by Step5.\n\n   But wait: what if the string has no 'b'? Then Step2 fails. Similarly, no 'a' fails Step2.\n\n   Let's test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example1: \"aaabccc\" -> YES (correct)\n        Example2: \"bbacc\" -> \n            Step2: has 'b' and 'a' -> yes.\n            Step3: check order: \n                'b','b','a' -> 'a' < 'b' -> invalid -> NO (correct)\n        Example3: \"aabc\" -> \n            Step2: has 'a' and 'b' -> yes.\n            Step3: order: 'a','a','b','c' -> valid.\n            Step4: n_a=2, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> 1==2? no; 1==1? yes -> YES (correct)\n\n   But wait: there's an example \"aaa\" (without 'b')? \n        Step2: no 'b' -> NO.\n\n   Example: \"bbb\" -> Step2: no 'a' -> NO.\n\n   Example: \"abc\" -> \n        Step2: has 'a' and 'b' -> yes.\n        Step3: order: 'a','b','c' -> valid.\n        Step4: n_a=1, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> 1==1 or 1==1 -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaccc\" -> \n        Step2: has 'a' and 'b'? There's no 'b' -> Step2 fails -> NO.\n\n   But wait, \"aaccc\" has no 'b', so according to Step2, we output NO.\n\n   However, the problem states that after B appends, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Therefore, Step2 is correct.\n\n   But note: the entire string is built by the three steps. The B-given part must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Therefore, the entire string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n\n   One more corner: the string \"acb\" — \n        Step2: has 'a' and 'b' -> yes.\n        Step3: check order: \n            'a','c','b' -> 'c' > 'a' is okay, but then 'b' < 'c' -> not non-decreasing -> NO.\n\n   This is correct because the process requires that the 'a's come first, then the 'b's, then the 'c's. In \"acb\", we have an 'a', then a 'c' (which is not allowed because the 'b's must come before the 'c's) and then a 'b' (which breaks the order).\n\n   Therefore, the code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        # If the string is empty, then no a and no b -> NO\n        if len(s) == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Step 2: Check at least one 'a' and one 'b'\n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s:\n            # Actually, we need at least one 'a' and one 'b'. But note: the string might have both but the condition of Step2 is met, but wait: the condition above checks for presence. \n            # However, the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b', so if either is missing, we output NO.\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Step 3: Check non-decreasing order\n        for i in range(1, len(s)):\n            if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Step 4: Count the letters\n        count_a = s.count('a')\n        count_b = s.count('b')\n        count_c = s.count('c')\n\n        # Step 5: Check condition on count_c\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. But what if the string has both, but the counts are zero? Actually, the string having 'a' and 'b' (at least one each) is guaranteed by the condition above.\n\n   But wait: the condition above uses `if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s` — this is equivalent to: if there's no 'a' OR no 'b', then print \"NO\". \n\n   However, the problem requires that the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So we should check that both are present.\n\n   Correction: we should use `and` in the condition? Actually, no: the condition is that we require both. The expression `'a' not in s or 'b' not in s` is True if either is missing. So if both are present, then `not ('a' not in s or 'b' not in s)` is true, which is equivalent to `'a' in s and 'b' in s`.\n\n   But wait, the condition above is:\n\n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   This is correct: if there is no 'a' OR no 'b', then we output NO.\n\n   However, note: the string might have other characters? The problem says only 'a','b','c'. So we are safe.\n\n   But note: the example \"aaabccc\" has both 'a' and 'b', so condition passes.\n\n   One more corner: the string \"a\" — \n        Step2: no 'b' -> NO.\n\n   The string \"b\" — \n        Step2: no 'a' -> NO.\n\n   The string \"ab\" — \n        Step2: has both -> pass.\n        Step3: order: 'a','b' -> valid.\n        Step4: count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=0 -> condition: 0==1? No. 0==1? No -> NO.\n\n   But wait: the process requires that after B appends, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends some number of 'c's (which must be equal to the number of 'a' or 'b' in the string that B gave). The string that B gave is \"ab\", so the number of 'c' must be 1 or 1. So C must append 1 'c'. Therefore, the string \"ab\" is not valid, because C must append at least one 'c'. \n\n   However, the entire string we have is \"ab\", meaning no 'c' was appended. But the condition requires that the number of 'c' is 1 (since the B-given part has 1 'a' and 1 'b'). Therefore, the string \"ab\" is not valid.\n\n   Our code outputs NO for \"ab\", which is correct.\n\n   But what if the string is \"aabbcc\"?\n        Count: a=2, b=2, c=2 -> condition: 2==2 or 2==2 -> YES.\n\n   However, the condition for the number of 'c' is based on the B-given part. The B-given part is \"aabb\", so the number of 'a' is 2, the number of 'b' is 2. Then C appends 2 'c's. So the entire string is \"aabbcc\", which matches.\n\n   But wait, what if the string is \"aabbc\"? \n        Condition0: has 'a' and 'b' -> yes.\n        Condition1: non-decreasing: 'a','a','b','b','c' ->",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed through a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order and under certain conditions. The solution involves checking three main conditions: the presence of at least one 'a' and one 'b', the non-decreasing order of characters, and the count of 'c's matching either the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of 'a' and 'b'**: The string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b' as per the problem's requirements.\n2. **Non-decreasing Order Check**: The string must be in non-decreasing order (all 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's) because the construction process appends characters in this specific sequence.\n3. **Count Condition for 'c's**: The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This is derived from the condition that C appends 'c's equal to the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string provided by B.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    if len(s) == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: The code first checks if the string is empty. If it is, the answer is immediately \"NO\" since the problem requires at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n2. **Presence of 'a' and 'b'**: The code verifies that the string contains both 'a' and 'b'. If either is missing, it prints \"NO\".\n3. **Order Check**: The code ensures the string is in non-decreasing order by comparing each character with the next one. If any character is found to be smaller than the previous one, it prints \"NO\".\n4. **Count Condition**: The code counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string. If the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the string can be constructed according to the specified process.",
