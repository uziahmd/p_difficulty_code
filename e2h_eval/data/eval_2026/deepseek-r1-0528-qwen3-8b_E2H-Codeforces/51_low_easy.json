Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile) with the combined frequency of the first two.\n 3. If the two frequencies match exactly (same letters and same counts), then output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that the pile should be exactly the letters from the two names (without extra or missing).\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines, strip the newlines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines to form a string that represents all the letters needed.\n - Count the frequency of each letter in the concatenated string and in the third string.\n - Compare the two frequency counts.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        SANTACLAUS\n        DEDMOROZ\n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   We combine: \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n   Then we count the letters in \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" and compare with the count in \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n But note: the example input has a trailing newline? We use strip to remove any extraneous whitespace or newline.\n\n However, note: the input may have newline characters. We can use .strip() to remove them.\n\n Alternatively, we can just read the lines and then remove the newline if present.\n\n Let's do:\n\n   guest = input().strip()\n   host = input().strip()\n   pile = input().strip()\n\n Then:\n   total_letters = guest + host\n   total_letters_count = frequency count of total_letters\n   pile_count = frequency count of pile\n\n Then check if for every letter in total_letters_count, the count matches, and also there are no extra letters in the pile.\n\n But note: the pile might have extra letters or missing ones. So we must check that the set of letters in the pile is a subset of the set of letters in total_letters, and the counts are equal.\n\n Actually, we can simply compare the sorted list of characters? Or better, use collections.Counter.\n\n Steps using Counter:\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   c1 = Counter(total_letters)\n   c2 = Counter(pile)\n\n   Then, if c1 == c2, then YES, else NO.\n\n Example 2 and 3 should give NO.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 2:\n   Input:\n        PAPAINOEL\n        JOULUPUKKI\n        JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\n   Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n   We need to check against \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   Let me count manually:\n        Combined: \n            P: 2, A: 2, I: 2, N: 1, O: 2, E: 1, L: 1, J: 1, U: 3, K: 2\n\n        Pile:\n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI -> \n            Let's break down: \n                J:1, O:2, U:3, L:2, N:1, A:2, P:2, I:1, E:1, K:2 -> wait, but wait, let me count again.\n\n        Actually, the example says: \n            \"In the second sample letter 'P' is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter 'L'.\"\n\n        In the combined, L is 1 (from PAPAINOEL: no L, from JOULUPUKKI: one L). \n        In the pile, L appears twice (from the string: 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI') -> so indeed, one extra L and no P.\n\n        But wait, in the pile: \n            JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n            Counting L: \n                ... there is 'L' in \"JOUL\" and then later an extra 'L' in \"LELUPUKKI\" (so two L's).\n\n        So the pile has two L's, while the combined has only one. Therefore, c1 != c2.\n\n Example 3:\n        Input:\n            BABBONATALE\n            FATHERCHRISTMAS\n            BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\n        The example says: there's an extra letter 'L'.\n\n        Combined: \"BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n        Pile: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n        We need to check the frequency.\n\n        Combined: \n            B: 2, A: 4, B: ... (wait, let's break down)\n\n        Alternatively, we can just use",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves comparing the frequency of each letter in the combined names with the frequency of letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Inputs**: The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name, respectively. The third line is the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Count Letters**: Use a frequency counter (like `collections.Counter`) to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Compare Frequencies**: Check if the frequency counts of the combined names and the pile match exactly. If they do, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of letters required to form the names from the given pile, ensuring no extra or missing letters are present.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    total_letters = guest + host\n    total_counter = Counter(total_letters)\n    pile_counter = Counter(pile)\n    \n    print(\"YES\" if total_counter == pile_counter else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Inputs**: The program reads three lines of input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are combined into a single string (`total_letters`).\n3. **Frequency Counting**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined names and the pile.\n4. **Comparison**: The program checks if the frequency counts of the combined names and the pile are identical. If they are, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\". This ensures that all letters in the pile can be used exactly to form the combined names without any extra or missing letters. \n\nThis method efficiently verifies the solution by leveraging the `Counter` class to handle frequency comparisons, making the code concise and easy to understand.",
