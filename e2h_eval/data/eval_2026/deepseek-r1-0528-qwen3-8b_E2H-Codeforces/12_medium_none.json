The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the ringroad is circular and we can only move clockwise, note that moving from house x to house y:\n   If x <= y: then the distance is (y - x) mod n? Actually, because it's circular and clockwise, but note that we can't go counterclockwise.\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is one-way clockwise. So from house 1 we can go to 2,3,...,n, then 1 again.\n\n But note: we start at house 1 and we must complete tasks in increasing index order (but the task locations can be arbitrary).\n\n Important: The problem says \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\" meaning we must do them in order.\n\n However, note that the example input: \n     Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n     Output: 6\n\n Steps for the example:\n     Start at house 1.\n     First task at house 3: \n        From 1 to 3: we can go 1->2->3 (2 steps) OR 1->4->3 (but wait, 1->4 is one step, then 4->3 is not allowed because we can only go clockwise? \n        Actually, clockwise from 1 goes to 2, then 3, then 4, then back to 1. So from 1 to 3: the direct clockwise way is 1->2->3 (distance 2). \n        Alternatively, going the other way is not allowed.\n\n     Then from 3 to 2: \n        But note: from 3, clockwise: 3->4->1->2. That would be 3 steps. However, the example says the optimal sequence is 1->2->3->4->1->2->3, which is 6 steps.\n\n     Let me break down the example:\n\n        Start at 1.\n        Then go to 3: 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n        Then from 3 to 2: 3->4->1->2 (3 steps) -> total so far 5\n        Then from 2 to 3: 2->3 (1 step) -> total 6.\n\n     But wait, why not do from 3 to 2 by going the short way? However, the ringroad is one-way and clockwise, so we cannot go from 3 to 2 directly. \n        The only way is to go from 3 to 4, then 4 to 1, then 1 to 2.\n\n     However, note that the problem says: \"Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\" but that doesn't change the movement.\n\n Approach:\n\n We need to compute the total time (number of moves) to complete all tasks.\n\n Observation:\n   We start at house 1. Then we have to visit the task houses in the order of the input.\n\n   Since we can only move clockwise, the movement from house x to house y is:\n        If y >= x: then the distance is y - x.\n        If y < x: then the distance is (n - x + y) [because we go from x to n, then wrap around to 1 and then to y].\n\n   But wait, the example from 3 to 2: \n        Using the above: since 2 < 3, then distance = (4 - 3 + 2) = 1 + 2 = 3. Correct.\n\n   However, note: sometimes we might have consecutive tasks and we don't want to recalculate the entire journey from scratch.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        total_time = 0\n        current = 1\n\n        For each task location a_i:\n            if a_i >= current:\n                steps = a_i - current\n            else:\n                steps = n - current + a_i\n\n            Then update current to a_i.\n\n        Then add steps to total_time.\n\n   But wait, let's try the example: [3,2,3] with n=4.\n\n        Start at 1.\n\n        Task1: 3 -> steps = 3-1 = 2 -> total=2, current=3.\n        Task2: 2 -> since 2<3, steps = 4-3+2 = 3 -> total=5, current=2.\n        Task3: 3 -> since 3>=2, steps=3-2=1 -> total=6.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, consider another example: [2,3,3] (second example) -> output 2.\n\n        Start at 1.\n\n        Task1: 2 -> steps = 2-1 = 1 -> total=1, current=2.\n        Task2: 3 -> steps = 3-2 = 1 -> total=2, current=3.\n        Task3: 3 -> steps=0 (since 3>=3) -> total=2.\n\n   So output 2.\n\n   But wait, what if the tasks are not in increasing order? The problem says: \"complete all tasks with numbers less than i\", meaning the tasks are given in order and we must complete them in that order.\n\n   However, note: the input is given as m integers, and the i-th task is at a_i. We must do them in the given order.\n\n   But consider: [3,1] with n=4.\n\n        Start at 1.\n        Task1: 3 -> steps = 3-1=2, current=3.\n        Task2: 1 -> steps = (4-3+1)=2, total=4.\n\n        Alternatively, we could think: from 3 to 1: clockwise: 3->4->1, which is 2 steps. Correct.\n\n   But note: there is a catch. The problem says \"Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\" but our method handles that by setting steps=0 when the next task is the same.\n\n   However, we must consider that the tasks are given in the order of execution, and we are only allowed to move clockwise.\n\n   But wait: what if the tasks are given in an order that requires going backwards? Our formula always computes the clockwise distance.\n\n   However, the example [3,1] requires going from 3 to 1 clockwise, which is 2 steps.\n\n   But is there a possibility of optimizing the entire journey? \n\n   Actually, note: the problem does not require to minimize the route by skipping some tasks? No, because we must complete the tasks in order.\n\n   However, the above method is straightforward and uses the fact that we can only move clockwise.\n\n   But note: the constraints: n, m up to 10^5. The above method is O(m) and each step is O(1), so it's efficient.\n\n   However, let's test with a large example.\n\n   Example: n=100000, m=100000, and the tasks are in increasing order: [2,3,4,...,100000,1] (then from 100000 to 1, which is 1 step because 1 is less than 100000, so we do (n - 100000 + 1) = 1)\n\n        Step1: from 1 to 2: 1 step.\n        Step2: from 2 to 3: 1 step.\n        ...\n        Step99999: from 99999 to 100000: 1 step.\n        Step100000: from 100000 to 1: (100000 - 100000 + 1) = 1 step.\n\n        Total steps: 100000.\n\n   But wait, the first task is at 2, so we start at 1 and then go to 2 (1 step). Then from 2 to 3 (another 1) ... until 100000. Then from 100000 to 1: 1 step.\n\n        Total steps = 1 * (number of moves) = 1 * (m) = 100000.\n\n   Another example: tasks in decreasing order: [100000, 99999, 99998, ..., 1]\n\n        Step1: from 1 to 100000: 100000-1 = 99999 steps.\n        Step2: from 100000 to 99999: (n - 100000 + 99999) = 100000 - 100000 + 99999 = 99999 steps.\n        Step3: from 99999 to 99998: (100000 - 99999 + 99998) = 1 + 99998 = 99999 steps.\n\n        Each step is 99999 steps? Then for m=100000, the total steps would be 99999 * 100000, which is 9999900000, that is acceptable in Python as an integer, but note that the problem says the answer is an integer.\n\n   However, wait: the example [100000, 99999, ...] is actually:\n\n        Step1: 1 -> 100000: 99999 steps (because 100000>=1 -> no, wait: 100000>=1 is true, so steps = 100000-1 = 99999.\n        Step2: 100000 -> 99999: 99999 < 100000 -> steps = n - 100000 + 99999 = 100000 - 100000 + 99999 = 99999.\n        Step3: 99999 -> 99998: 99998 < 99999 -> steps = 100000 - 99999 + 99998 = 1 + 99998 = 99999.\n\n        So indeed each step is 99999, and there are 100000 steps (from the first task to the last) so total steps = 99999 * 100000.\n\n   But wait, the number of moves is the sum over the tasks (except the first) but wait, the first task is included.\n\n   Actually, we have m tasks, so we do m-1 moves? No, because we start at house 1 and then we have to go to the first task (which is the first move). Then from the first task to the second, etc.\n\n   So we have m moves? Actually, we start at house 1, then we move to the first task (which is the first move) and then from the first task to the second (second move) ... until the last task.\n\n   Therefore, the total moves is the sum of the steps for each of the m tasks (including the first one). But note: we don't have a starting point for the first task?\n\n   Actually, the problem says initially she is at house 1, and the first task is at a1. So we need to go from 1 to a1 (which is the first move).\n\n   So the code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for a in tasks:\n            if a >= current:\n                steps = a - current\n            else:\n                steps = n - current + a\n            total_time += steps\n            current = a\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   But wait, the example [3,2,3] gives 6, and [2,3,3] gives 2, which are correct.\n\n   However, let's check the example [1,2,3] (with n=4):\n\n        Start at 1.\n        Task1: 1 -> steps = 0 (since 1>=1) -> total_time=0, current=1.\n        Task2: 2 -> steps = 2-1=1 -> total_time=1, current=2.\n        Task3: 3 -> steps=3-2=1 -> total_time=2.\n\n        But the actual path: \n            Start at 1 (already there) -> then to 2 (1 step) -> then to 3 (1 step) -> total 2.\n\n   Another example: [1,1,1] (n=4): \n        Start at 1.\n        Task1: 1 -> steps=0, current=1.\n        Task2: 1 -> steps=0, current=1.\n        Task3: 1 -> steps=0, current=1.\n        Total_time=0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says \"moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time\". \n        In the case of staying at the same house, we don't move, so 0.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1\", and then she has m things to do. The first task is at house a1, and if a1 is 1, then no movement is needed.\n\n   So the code is as above.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say n and m can be up to 10^5. The above loop is O(m) and each operation is O(1), so it will run in time.\n\n   But wait: the example [100000, 99999, ...] (decreasing) leads to a very large total_time (about 10^10), but that is acceptable because the problem allows 64-bit integers.\n\n   However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, but the problem says to use %I64d in C++ but in Python we just use int.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"do not use the %lld specifier\", but in Python we don't use that.\n\n   So we write the code accordingly.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" -> output 6.\n        Example 2: \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" -> output 2.\n\n   However, wait: the example input is given as two strings in a list? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Input:\n            ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n   But in the problem statement, the input is provided as two lines.\n\n   We are reading:\n\n        first_line = input().split() -> two integers\n        second_line = input().split() -> list of m integers\n\n   But the example input is provided as two separate lines.\n\n   However, the example is given as:\n\n        Input:\n            4 3\n            3 2 3\n\n   So the code should read:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   But wait: the example input string is given as \"4 3\\n3 2 3\", meaning two lines.\n\n   However, the problem says:\n\n        The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). \n        The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n).\n\n   So we read two lines.\n\n   Let me test with the example [3,2,3] and [2,3,3] to see if the code produces the expected outputs.\n\n   Example 1: \n        n=4, m=3, tasks = [3,2,3]\n        current = 1\n        a=3: 3>=1 -> steps=2, total_time=2, current=3.\n        a=2: 2<3 -> steps=4-3+2=3, total_time=5, current=2.\n        a=3: 3>=2 -> steps=1, total_time=6.\n\n   Example 2:\n        n=4, m=3, tasks=[2,3,3]\n        current=1\n        a=2: 2>=1 -> steps=1, total_time=1, current=2.\n        a=3: 3>=2 -> steps=1, total_time=2, current=3.\n        a=3: 3>=3 -> steps=0, total_time=2.\n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is circular and the houses are numbered 1 to n clockwise. And movement is only clockwise.\n\n   One more example: [1,4,2] (n=4)\n\n        Start at 1.\n        a=1: steps=0, current=1.\n        a=4: steps=4-1=3, total_time=3, current=4.\n        a=2: steps= (4-4+2)=2, total_time=5.\n\n        Actual path: \n            Start at 1.\n            Then stay at 1 (for the first task).\n            Then move from 1 to 4: 1->2->3->4 (3 steps)\n            Then from 4 to 2: 4->1->2 (2 steps)\n\n        Total 5.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait, is there a shorter path? \n        From 1 to 4: must be 3 steps (clockwise: 1->2->3->4). \n        From 4 to 2: clockwise: 4->1->2 (2 steps). \n        So 5 is minimal.\n\n   However, note: after finishing the first task (at 1) we are still at 1. Then we go to 4 (3 steps) and then from 4 to 2 (2 steps). \n\n   So the code is correct.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: There is one more consideration: the problem says the ringroad has n houses, so the houses are 1,2,...,n.\n\n   The formula for the distance from x to y (clockwise) is:\n        if y >= x: y - x\n        else: n - x + y\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for a in tasks:\n            if a >= current:\n                total_time += a - current\n            else:\n                total_time += n - current + a\n            current = a\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   Let me submit this.\n\n   However, wait: the problem statement says the ringroad has n houses, and the houses are numbered 1 to n. \n        The movement from house x to house y (if x>y) must be: go from x to x+1, then x+2, ... until n, then 1, then 2, ... until y.\n\n        Alternatively, the clockwise distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n, but note that mod arithmetic for negative: \n            We want a nonnegative number. The standard way is (y - x) % n, but that is not the same.\n\n        Example: from 3 to 2 in n=4: (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3 (if we take modulo that way). But note: the modulo operation in Python for negative is defined as: \n            a % b = a - b * floor(a/b)\n\n        But wait: \n            (2-3) % 4 = (-1) % 4 = 3 (because 3 is the smallest non-negative remainder: 4*floor(-1/4)=4*(-1)=-4, then -1 - (-4)=3).\n\n        So we can also compute the distance as: (a - current) % n, but wait:\n\n            If a>=current, then (a-current) % n = a-current (if a-current < n) and if a-current >= n, then we subtract n until it's in [0, n-1]. But our a and current are between 1 and n, and a>=current, then a-current is at most n-1 (if a=n, current=1, then n-1). So modulo doesn't change it.\n\n            If a < current: then (a - current) % n = (a - current + n) % n, but note: a - current is negative and adding n makes it positive, and then modulo n? But we don't need modulo because we know the result is positive and less than n? Actually, the distance is (n - current + a) which is the same as (a - current + n) (without modulo) and that is the same as (a - current) % n? \n\n        Actually, yes: \n            (a - current) % n = (a - current + n) % n   [if a-current is negative, then adding n makes it positive and less than n? Not exactly: \n                Example: a=2, current=3, n=4: (2-3) %4 = (-1)%4 = 3, and (2-3+4)=3, and 3%4=3.\n\n            But if we do (a - current) % n, then for a>=current, it is the same as (a-current) because (a-current) is in [0, n-1] (since a<=n, current>=1, so a-current <= n-1, and >=0). \n\n            However, note: a and current are between 1 and n, and a>=current, then a-current is in [0, n-1] (because a<=n and current>=1, so maximum a is n, minimum current is 1 -> n-1). So (a-current) % n = a-current.\n\n        So we can also write:\n\n            steps = (a - current) % n\n            But wait: if we use modulo, then if a>=current, it works, but if a<current, then (a-current) % n = (a - current + n) % n, which is the same as our formula.\n\n        However, note: the modulo operation might give a negative remainder in some languages, but in Python, % gives non-negative. \n\n        But the problem: if we do (a - current) % n, then for a>=current, it's the same. For a<current, it's (a-current+n) % n, which is the same as our formula.\n\n        But wait: what if (a - current) is negative and (a-current+n) is positive and greater than or equal to n? Then modulo n would reduce it.\n\n        Example: n=5, current=2, a=1: \n            Without modulo: steps = 5-2+1 = 4.\n            With modulo: (1-2) %5 = (-1)%5 = 4 -> same.\n\n        Example: n=5, current=3, a=1: \n            Without modulo: 5-3+1=3.\n            With modulo: (1-3)%5 = (-2)%5 = 3 -> same.\n\n        Example: n=5, current=3, a=0? But a is from 1 to n, so a>=1.\n\n        So we can also do:\n\n            steps = (a - current) % n\n            but wait, what if a>=current? Then (a-current) is positive and less than n? Actually, if a>=current, then a-current is at least 0 and at most n-1 (because a<=n, current>=1 -> a-current <= n-1). So (a-current) % n is a-current.\n\n            But note: if a=current, then 0 % n = 0, which is correct.\n\n        However, the modulo operation is defined for negative as well, and we are getting the same result.\n\n        But wait: what if the difference is negative and we add n, but then the result is still negative? No, because if a<current, then a-current is negative, so we add n (which is positive) and then modulo n. But note: the modulo operation in Python does the right thing.\n\n        However, the problem is that (a - current) % n is the same as (a - current + n) if (a - current) is negative and (a - current + n) is positive and less than n? Not necessarily: \n            Example: n=5, current=1, a=5: \n                Without modulo: 5>=1 -> steps=4, but wait: 5-1=4, which is correct.\n\n            Now, if we do (a - current) % n for a=5, current=1: (5-1)%5=4%5=4 -> correct.\n\n            Example: a=5, current=2: (5-2)=3 -> 3%5=3 -> correct.\n\n            Example: a=5, current=5: 0 -> correct.\n\n            Example: a=5, current=6? But current is from the tasks and we set current to a, and a is in [1,n] so current is in [1,n]. \n\n        So we can use modulo, but note: the modulo operation might be slightly slower than a conditional.\n\n        But the problem size is 10^5, so both are acceptable.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\" \n\n        In Python, we don't care about the specifier, but we are using the straightforward method.\n\n        But let's stick to the conditional for clarity.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            steps = (a - current) % n\n            # But wait, if (a - current) is negative, then modulo gives the positive value, and if positive, then modulo doesn't change. However, note that the modulo operation in Python for positive numbers less than n is the same as the number.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the modulo operation is defined for negative as well, but the problem is that the movement from x to y is the smallest clockwise distance. But note: the clockwise distance is defined as the non-negative steps to move from x to y without going backwards.\n\n        Actually, the distance from x to y clockwise is the smallest non-negative integer d such that (x + d) mod n = y, but note our houses are 1-indexed and the modulo operation here is not exactly the same.\n\n        But wait, the ringroad is circular and the houses are 1 to n. The clockwise distance from x to y is:\n\n            If we consider the positions on a circle, the clockwise distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n, but we have to adjust for the fact that the circle wraps from n to 1.\n\n        Actually, the standard way is:\n\n            d = (y - x) % n\n            But if d==0, then we are at the same house, but if d>0, then we move d steps.\n\n        However, note: if y==x, then (y-x)%n=0, which is correct.\n\n        But if y<x, then (y-x) is negative, and (y-x)%n = (y-x+n) % n, and since y-x+n is positive and less than n? Not necessarily: \n            Example: y=1, x=2, n=4: (1-2)%4 = (-1)%4=3, which is correct.\n\n        However, the issue is that in modular arithmetic, the distance should be the smallest nonnegative d such that (x + d) mod n = y, but note that in our numbering, the houses are 1-indexed. \n\n        But wait, the movement: \n            Starting at x, we move clockwise d steps: we end up at (x + d - 1) % n + 1?\n\n        Actually, we don't need to use modulo for the entire calculation because our formula is:\n\n            if a>=current: steps = a - current\n            else: steps = n - current + a\n\n        This is equivalent to the clockwise distance.\n\n        We'll stick to the conditional.\n\n   However, note: there is a possibility to avoid branching by using:\n\n        steps = (a - current) % n\n        if steps == 0 and (a != current): \n            # Actually, if a==current, then steps=0 is desired. \n        But wait, if a==current, then (a-current)%n=0, which is correct.\n\n        But wait, what if a != current and (a - current) % n is negative? We don't have to worry because modulo already gives a nonnegative.\n\n        However, the problem is that (a - current) % n is the same as our formula, but note: \n\n            When a>=current: (a-current) is positive and less than n (because a<=n and current>=1, so a-current <= n-1). So modulo doesn't change it.\n\n            When a<current: (a-current) is negative, and (a-current+n) is positive and less than n (because a>=1, current<=n, then a-current+n >= 1-n+n = 1, and a-current+n <= n-1+n? Actually, no: a is at least 1 and at most n, current is at least 1 and at most n, and a<current, so the maximum value of (a-current+n) is (n-1 - 1 + n) = 2*n-2, which is greater than n. \n\n        Example: n=4, a=1, current=3: (1-3)%4 = (-2)%4 = 2 (which is correct: 3->4->1, 2 steps). But wait, 2 is less than n=4, so it's correct.\n\n        But wait, what if a=1, current=4, n=5: \n            (1-4)%5 = (-3)%5 = 2 (since -3 + 5 = 2) -> steps=2. \n            Without modulo: steps = n - current + a = 5-4+1=2. Correct.\n\n        But what if a=1, current=5, n=5? \n            (1-5)%5 = (-4)%5 = 1 (since -4+5=1). \n            Without modulo: steps = n - current + a = 5-5+1=1. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: if current=5, then the next task is at 1. In a ringroad of 5 houses: \n            Start at 5, then clockwise: 5->1 (1 step). Correct.\n\n        But wait, the modulo formula: (a - current) % n is defined for any integers a and current, but note: our a and current are in the range [1, n]. \n\n        However, the modulo operation in Python for negative numbers: \n\n            (-4) % 5 = 1, because 5 * (-1) = -5, and -4 - (-5) = 1.\n\n        So the modulo formula gives the same result.\n\n        But note: the distance we computed is the same as (a - current) mod n, and that is the clockwise distance? \n\n        Actually, the clockwise distance from x to y in a circle of n houses (1-indexed) is the smallest nonnegative d such that (x + d) mod n = y, but note: our modulo operation is defined for the additive group of integers modulo n. However, our houses are 1-indexed, so we must map:\n\n            Let x0 = x-1, y0 = y-1, then the clockwise distance from x to y is (y0 - x0) mod n, but then convert back? \n\n        Actually, we can define:\n\n            Let d = (y - x) % n   [using the natural numbers 1..n]\n\n        But wait, the mapping: \n            We can map the houses to 0-indexed: \n                Let x0 = x-1, y0 = y-1.\n                Then the clockwise distance from x to y is (y0 - x0) % n, but if negative then add n.\n\n            Then convert back: the distance in 0-indexed is (y0 - x0) % n, and then the same as (y-x) % n in 1-indexed? \n\n        Actually, (y-x) % n is the same as (y0-x0) % n (because subtracting 1 twice: (y-1 - (x-1)) = y-x). \n\n        So the formula holds.\n\n        However, we don't need to use modulo because the conditional is clear and efficient.\n\n   Therefore, we'll keep the conditional.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        tasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        current = 1\n        total_time = 0\n\n        for a in tasks:\n            if a >= current:\n                total_time += a - current\n            else:\n                total_time += n - current + a\n            current = a\n\n        print(total_time)\n\n   Let me run the sample inputs again to be safe.\n\n   Example 1: [3,2,3] -> 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n   Example 2: [2,3,3] -> 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.\n\n   It's correct.\n\n   However, wait: the problem statement example input was given as:\n\n        Input: \n            ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n        But note: the first example input is \"4 3\\n3 2 3\", meaning n=4, m=3, and the tasks are [3,2,3]. \n\n   We are printing 6 and 2, respectively.\n\n   Therefore, the code is ready.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house\", and our code handles that by having a>=current (so steps=0) for consecutive same houses.\n\n   We'll submit the code.\n\n   However, wait: there is a known alternative solution that uses cumulative sums and avoids the loop by precomputing the positions? \n\n   But the problem requires to do the tasks in order, so we must simulate the journey in the given order.\n\n   Therefore, the above solution is optimal.\n\n   Let me test with a larger example to make sure there are no off-by-one errors.\n\n   Example: n=5, tasks=[5,1,3]\n\n        Start at 1.\n        a=5: 5>=1 -> steps=4, total_time=4, current=5.\n        a=1: 1<5 -> steps=5-5+1=1, total_time=5, current=1.\n        a=3: 3>=1 -> steps=2, total_time=7.\n\n        Actual path:\n            Start at 1.\n            Go from 1 to 5: 1->2->3->4->5 (4 steps)\n            Then from 5 to 1: 5->1 (1 step)\n            Then from 1 to 3: 1->2->3 (2 steps)\n            Total: 4+1+2=7.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   Another example: n=5, tasks=[1,5,1,3]\n\n        Start at 1.\n        a=1: 0, current=1.\n        a=5: 4, total_time=4, current=5.\n        a=1: 1, total_time=5, current=1.\n        a=3: 2, total_time=7.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   I think we are good.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the ringroad is circular and clockwise, and we are only moving clockwise.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        cur = 1\n        time = 0\n        for a in arr:\n            if a >= cur:\n                time += a - cur\n            else:\n                time += n - cur + a\n            cur = a\n\n        print(time)\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a circular ringroad in a clockwise direction. The ringroad consists of `n` houses numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order. Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete her tasks in the given order, moving only clockwise between houses. Each move between neighboring houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must visit a sequence of houses specified by the task locations. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only. The challenge is to calculate the total time taken to move from her current house to each subsequent task house in the given order.\n2. **Key Insight**: The time taken to move from house `x` to house `y` depends on their positions:\n   - If `y >= x`, the distance is simply `y - x`.\n   - If `y < x`, the distance is `(n - x) + y` because Xenia has to move from `x` to the end of the ringroad (house `n`) and then wrap around to house `y`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate through each task location, compute the distance from the current house to the next task house using the above conditions, and accumulate the total time. The current house is updated after each task to reflect Xenia's new position.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(m), where `m` is the number of tasks, which is optimal for the given constraints (m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor a in tasks:\n    if a >= current:\n        total_time += a - current\n    else:\n        total_time += n - current + a\n    current = a\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Read the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. Then read the list of task locations.\n- **Processing Tasks**: For each task location `a`:\n  - If `a` is greater than or equal to the current house, add the difference `a - current` to the total time.\n  - If `a` is less than the current house, add `(n - current) + a` to the total time, accounting for the circular movement.\n- **Update Position**: After processing each task, update the current house to the task location.\n- **Output**: Print the accumulated total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the circular nature of the ringroad and straightforward arithmetic based on the relative positions of consecutive tasks.",
