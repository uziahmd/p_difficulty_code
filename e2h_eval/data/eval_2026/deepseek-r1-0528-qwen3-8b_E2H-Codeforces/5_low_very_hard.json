Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (n up to 150000). Each string contains lowercase Latin letters or '?'. We need to form as many pairs as possible (each boot in at most one pair) such that:\n   - A specific color must match exactly.\n   - '?' can match any color.\n\n However, note: the problem also requires printing the maximum number of pairs and then the pairs (with indices).\n\n Approach:\n\n We cannot try all possibilities because n can be up to 150000. We need an efficient way.\n\n Idea:\n\n We have two types of boots: left and right. We can think of matching a left boot with a right boot.\n\n Let's break down the problem:\n\n 1. We can consider two kinds of matches:\n    a) Both are specific letters (not '?'): then they must be equal for compatibility.\n    b) One or both are '?': \n        - If left is '?' and right is '?', then compatible.\n        - If left is '?' and right is a letter, then compatible.\n        - If left is a letter and right is '?', then compatible.\n\n But note: the problem says an indefinite color (i.e., '?') is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.\n\n So, the condition is:\n   compatible if (l[i] == r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') OR (l[i]!='?' and r[j]=='?')?\n\n Actually, wait: the problem states:\n   - Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same.\n   - An indefinite color (like '?') is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.\n\n So, more precisely:\n   (l[i] == r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j] is any) OR (r[j]=='?' and l[i] is any)\n\n But note: if both are '?', then it's also compatible. And the condition above covers that: \n   If l[i]=='?' then regardless of what r[j] is, it's compatible. Similarly, if r[j]=='?', then regardless of what l[i] is, it's compatible.\n\n However, note that if both are '?', then we can use the condition: '?' matches anything. So the condition can be written as:\n   (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') is not complete.\n\n Actually, the condition should be:\n   if l[i] == '?' or r[j] == '?':\n        compatible = True\n   else:\n        compatible = (l[i] == r[j])\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n   compatible = (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and True) or (r[j]=='?' and True)\n\n But note: we cannot simply use OR because we don't want to require both to be non '?' for the exact match.\n\n Actually, the rule is: \n   The pair is compatible if (the left boot is '?' or the right boot is '?') OR (both are non '?' and they are equal).\n\n This is equivalent to:\n   (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') is not correct because we miss the cases where one is '?' and the other is '?'. \n\n Let me rephrase: \n   The condition is satisfied if:\n     (a) Either both are '?' -> compatible.\n     (b) Or one is '?' and the other is any (including '?') -> but wait, if one is '?' and the other is a letter, then it's covered by the rule. Also, if one is '?' and the other is '?', then it's covered by the rule that '?' is compatible with any.\n\n Actually, the rule can be simplified: \n   The pair is compatible if (l[i] == r[j]) OR (l[i]=='?' and r[j] is any) OR (r[j]=='?' and l[i] is any) OR (both are '?' and then we already have l[i]==r[j] because both are '?' so it's true).\n\n But note: if both are '?', then l[i]==r[j] is true (because '?'== '?' is true). So we can write:\n\n   if l[i] == '?' or r[j] == '?':\n        compatible = True\n   else:\n        compatible = (l[i] == r[j])\n\n However, wait: what if we have:\n   l[i] = 'a' and r[j] = '?' -> then we want to match. The above condition would say: because r[j]=='?' -> True.\n\n   l[i] = '?' and r[j] = 'a' -> True.\n\n   l[i] = '?' and r[j] = '?' -> True.\n\n   l[i] = 'a' and r[j] = 'a' -> True.\n\n   l[i] = 'a' and r[j]",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots, where each boot can be part of at most one pair. The compatibility is defined such that two specific colors must match exactly, while an indefinite color ('?') can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching each left boot with a right boot based on their colors. The key observation is that '?' can match any color, which simplifies the matching process but requires careful handling to maximize the number of pairs.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves categorizing the boots into two groups: those with specific colors (letters) and those with indefinite colors ('?'). We then prioritize matching specific colors first, followed by matching '?' with any remaining boots.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Step 1**: Count the number of '?' in both left and right boots. This helps in determining how many boots can potentially match with '?'.\n   - **Step 2**: Match boots with specific colors first. For each specific color in the left boots, find a matching color in the right boots, ensuring no boot is reused.\n   - **Step 3**: After matching all possible specific color pairs, use the remaining '?' boots to form as many pairs as possible. Each '?' in the left can pair with any '?' in the right, and vice versa.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot in linear time, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of boots.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_letters = []\n    left_question_marks = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            left_question_marks.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            left_letters.append((char, i+1))\n            \n    right_letters = []\n    right_question_marks = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        if char == '?':\n            right_question_marks.append(i+1)\n        else:\n            right_letters.append((char, i+1))\n            \n    left_letters.sort()\n    right_letters.sort()\n    left_question_marks.sort()\n    right_question_marks.sort()\n    \n    matches = []\n    total_specific_pairs = 0\n    \n    for color in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        left_list = [idx for c, idx in left_letters if c == color]\n        right_list = [idx for c, idx in right_letters if c == color]\n        left_list.sort()\n        right_list.sort()\n        while left_list and right_list:\n            left_idx = left_list.pop(0)\n            right_idx = right_list.pop(0)\n            matches.append((left_idx, right_idx))\n            total_specific_pairs += 1\n            \n    q_left = len(left_question_marks)\n    q_right = len(right_question_marks)\n    q_matches = min(q_left, q_right)\n    for i in range(q_matches):\n        matches.append((left_question_marks[i], right_question_marks[i]))\n        \n    print(len(matches))\n    for a, b in matches:\n        print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of boots and the two strings representing the left and right boots' colors.\n2. **Categorizing Boots**: The left and right boots are categorized into those with specific colors (letters) and those with indefinite colors ('?'). Indices are stored for later reference.\n3. **Matching Specific Colors**: For each color from 'a' to 'z', the algorithm matches left boots with the same color to right boots with the same color. This ensures all possible specific color pairs are matched first.\n4. **Matching Indefinite Colors**: After all specific color pairs are matched, the remaining '?' boots are paired together in the largest possible number of pairs.\n5. **Output**: The total number of pairs is printed, followed by each pair's indices.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs by prioritizing specific color matches and then utilizing the flexibility of '?' to form additional pairs.
