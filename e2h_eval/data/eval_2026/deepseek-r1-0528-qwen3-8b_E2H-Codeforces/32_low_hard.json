Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum value.\n Since the instability is defined as max - min, we can consider:\n  Option 1: Remove the minimum element. Then the new array's min would be the next smallest and max remains the same (if there are duplicates, the max might still be present).\n  Option 2: Remove the maximum element. Then the new array's max would be the next largest and min remains the same.\n\n However, note that sometimes removing an element that is neither the global min nor the global max might lead to a smaller instability? \n But observe: The instability is determined by the overall min and max of the remaining array. \n Removing an element that is not the min or max might only affect the min if it was the only min, or similarly for the max.\n\n Actually, let's think: \n   Let the original array have min = m and max = M.\n   If we remove one element, then the new min could be:\n        If we remove an element that is greater than m, then the min remains m (unless m is unique, then we have to look at the next smallest). \n        Similarly, the max remains M unless we remove the only occurrence of M.\n\n Therefore, the candidate removals are the elements that are either the global min or global max, because removing any other element doesn't change the min or max.\n\n But wait, what if the array has multiple minima or maxima?\n Example: [1, 3, 3, 7] -> \n     If we remove the first 1, then the array becomes [3,3,7] -> min=3, max=7, instability=4.\n     If we remove the 7, then the array becomes [1,3,3] -> min=1, max=3, instability=2.\n     If we remove one of the 3's, then the array becomes [1,3,7] -> min=1, max=7, instability=6.\n\n So we see that removing a non-extreme element doesn't help in this case.\n\n However, consider an array with two distinct values: [1, 2, 2, 3]. \n   Removing the 1: [2,2,3] -> min=2, max=3 -> instability=1.\n   Removing the 3: [1,2,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability=1.\n   Removing a 2: [1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n So the best is to remove an extreme. But note that in this example, the extremes are the 1 and 3.\n\n However, what if we have an array with more than two distinct numbers? The key observation is:\n\n We are allowed to remove exactly one element. The resulting array's min will be the min of the original array if we don't remove the only occurrence of the min, or the next smallest otherwise. Similarly for max.\n\n Therefore, we can consider:\n\n Candidate 1: Remove the smallest element (if there are multiple smallest, then the min of the remaining array is the next smallest distinct number? Actually, no: we can have duplicates. But note: if we remove one occurrence of the smallest, the new min is the smallest of the remaining. That might be the same smallest if there are duplicates, but if we remove one smallest and there are duplicates, then the min remains the same.\n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let sorted_a = sorted(a)\n   Then the original min = sorted_a[0], original max = sorted_a[-1]\n\n   If we remove the first element, then the new min is sorted_a[1] (if n>=2) and the max is still sorted_a[-1]. The instability becomes sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1].\n\n   If we remove the last element, then the new max is sorted_a[-2] and the min is sorted_a[0]. The instability becomes sorted_a[-2] - sorted_a[0].\n\n   But what if we remove an element that is in the middle? Then the min and max remain the same (unless we remove the only occurrence of the min or max). However, note that the min and max of the entire array are fixed by the smallest and largest values. \n\n   However, consider: we can also consider the possibility of having an array where the min is duplicated and the max is duplicated. Then removing one duplicate might not change the min or max.\n\n   But note: the goal is to minimize the instability. The instability of the entire array without one element is:\n\n      instability_i = max(remaining) - min(remaining)\n\n   We can compute the instability for each candidate removal (but n can be up to 10^5, so we cannot try each removal).\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   We note that the min",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can potentially change either the minimum or the maximum value of the array. The optimal solution involves either removing the smallest element or the largest element to minimize the instability.\n2. **Intuition**: By removing the smallest element, the new minimum becomes the next smallest element in the array, while the maximum remains unchanged. Similarly, removing the largest element changes the maximum to the next largest element, leaving the minimum unchanged. The instability in these cases would be the difference between the original maximum and the new minimum (when removing the smallest element) or the original minimum and the new maximum (when removing the largest element).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n   - Calculate two candidate instabilities: one by removing the smallest element (instability = last element - second smallest element) and another by removing the largest element (instability = second largest element - first element).\n   - The minimum of these two values will be the answer since it represents the smallest possible instability achievable by removing either the smallest or largest element.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^5 \\). The subsequent operations are O(1), making the overall complexity dominated by the sorting step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    sorted_a = sorted(a)\n    candidate1 = sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1]\n    candidate2 = sorted_a[-2] - sorted_a[0]\n    \n    print(min(candidate1, candidate2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has exactly two elements, removing any one will result in an array with a single element, hence instability is zero.\n- **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n- **Candidate Calculation**: Two candidates for the minimum instability are computed:\n  - **Candidate1**: The instability when the smallest element is removed (difference between the largest and the second smallest element).\n  - **Candidate2**: The instability when the largest element is removed (difference between the second largest and the smallest element).\n- **Result**: The smaller of the two candidates is printed as the result, representing the minimal instability achievable by removing one element.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to considering only the extremities of the sorted array, leveraging sorting for optimal performance.",
