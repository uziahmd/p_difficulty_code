There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and we need to compute the maximum number of games the winner can take part in.\n\nObservation:\nIn a knockout tournament with n players, the winner must win all his/her games. However, the grid is arranged following a rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most 1.\n\nWe can think of the tournament as being structured in rounds, but the rule might allow for a structure that is not strictly balanced (like a complete binary tree). The goal is to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\nLet's denote by f(n) the maximum number of games the winner can play in a tournament with n players.\n\nWe can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: When n is a power of two, then the tournament is a complete binary tree and the winner will play in log2(n) games.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the entire tournament to be a full binary tree. The rule allows a more flexible arrangement.\n\nHowever, the example: \n  Input 3 -> Output 2.\n  Input 4 -> Output 2.\n\nWait, let's break down the examples:\n\nExample n=2: \n  Only one game. Winner plays 1 game. Output 1.\n\nExample n=3:\n  We can arrange two games: first between player1 and player2, then the winner (player1) plays against player3. So the winner (player1) plays 2 games.\n\nExample n=4:\n  If we do two semifinals (each with two players) and then the final, then the winner would play 2 games. But note: the rule says two players can play if their previous games differ by at most one.\n\n  However, the example says output is 2. But wait, what if we try to have the winner play 3 games? Then we would need 4 players: \n      Game1: Player1 vs Player2 -> Player1 wins (1 game for Player1)\n      Game2: Player3 vs Player4 -> Player3 wins (1 game for Player3)\n      Then Game3: Player1 vs Player3 -> Player1 wins (2nd game for Player1)\n      Then we need a fourth opponent for Player1? But there are no more players. \n\n  Alternatively, we might structure differently? Actually, the tournament must have exactly n-1 games because it's knockout. But the winner must win k games, so the total number of wins is k (for the winner) and the rest are distributed. However, the rule on pairing might restrict the depth.\n\nAnother way: we can model the tournament by having two halves. Suppose we split the remaining players (excluding the winner) into two groups such that the winner can play one group and then the other, but the total number of games the winner plays is the sum of the two halves.\n\nBut note: the condition: when the winner has already played some games, the next opponent must have played either the same number or one less or one more. Since the winner is winning, we can design the bracket so that the winner's opponents are scheduled appropriately.\n\nActually, we can use recursion:\n\nLet k be the maximum number of games the winner can play. Then, the tournament must have at least 2^k players (because the winner must defeat k opponents, each from distinct matches, and the minimal structure is a linear progression: first the winner beats one, then that winner beats another, etc.). However, we can also have a structure that is not linear.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider:\n\nLet F(k) be the minimum number of players required so that the winner can play k games.\n\nTo have k games, the winner must have k-1 wins to get to the k-th game. The k-th game must be against an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. \n\nBut how to build the tournament?\n\nWe can use the following recurrence:\n\nLet F(0) = 1 (the winner by default, no game)\nF(1) = 2 (the winner defeats one player)\n\nFor F(2): \n  The winner must have two games. In the first game, the winner beats someone (who came from a match of one player? Actually, the opponent in the second game must have played either 1 or 0 games. But note: the winner's second opponent must have played at least one game? Actually, the second opponent must have played 1 game (if the winner played 1 game, then the difference is 0) or 0? But wait, the condition: \"the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one\".\n\nWait, the rule applies to two players. At the time of the match between the winner and the second opponent, the winner has 1 game, so the second opponent must have 0, 1, or 2 games. But if the second opponent has 0 games, then that means he hasn't played any game, which is possible only if he was sitting out until now. However, the tournament is knockout so all players except the winner must lose at least once.\n\nBut we are trying to maximize the winner's games. How to minimize the total number of players for k games?\n\nActually, we can build the tournament as:\n\nRound 0: the winner is pre-qualified and then we have two groups: one group for the winner's opponents and one group for the other players.\n\nBut note: the rule requires that the winner's opponents must have played at most one game less than the winner. So the first opponent must have played 0 games. Then the winner has 1 game. Then the second opponent must have played either 0, 1, or 2? But if we want the winner to play a third game, then the third opponent must have played 1 or 2 games (because the winner has 2). However, the second opponent must have been defeated, and that second opponent must have come from a match. \n\nActually, the minimal structure for k games:\n\nThe winner must defeat k opponents. Each of these k opponents must have themselves won some matches.\n\nLet the winner's first opponent be a player who hasn't played any game (so we need to have that player). Then the winner's second opponent must be a player who has played 0 or 1 game. But if we want to use minimal players, we can arrange that the second opponent is the winner of a match between two new players (so that opponent has 1 game). Similarly, the third opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. \n\nWe can define F(k) as the minimal total number of players needed for the winner to have k games.\n\nThen, the tournament can be broken down as:\n\nTo have k games, we need to have the winner and k opponents. But the k opponents must have been obtained from sub-tournaments.\n\nSpecifically, the first opponent: 1 additional player.\nThe second opponent: 2 additional players (since he must have played one game, so he must have beaten one of the remaining).\nThe third opponent: 2 additional players (if we use the minimal structure) OR 4? \n\nWait, actually:\n\nWe can use the following recurrence:\n\nF(0) = 1 (only the winner)\nF(1) = 2 (the winner and one opponent)\n\nFor k>=1, to get the k-th game, we have the winner playing against an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games (so that the difference is at most one). But we are building the minimal structure.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire tournament as having the winner and then two subtrees (left and right) that together have the minimal structure for k-1 games? \n\nBut note: the rule doesn't require the entire tournament to be a balanced binary tree. We can mix the two conditions.\n\nActually, we can use:\n\nLet F(k) = 1 + F(k-1) + F(k-2)\n\nWhy?\n\nTo have k games, the winner must have played k-1 games already (so the k-th is the last). The opponent in the k-th game must have played either k-1 (then the opponent comes from a sub-tournament that requires F(k-1) players) or k-2 (then the opponent comes from a sub-tournament that requires F(k-2) players). But note: the winner's path is built by having the k-1 wins. The entire set of players includes the winner and the players in the two subtrees (which are the players that the winner beat directly or indirectly).\n\nHowever, the minimal total players required for the winner to have k games is:\n\nF(0) = 1\nF(1) = 2\nF(2) = 1 + F(1) + F(0) = 1+2+1 = 4\n\nBut wait, with 4 players we can have two semifinals and then a final. The winner would have 2 games. So F(2)=4.\n\nNow, what about k=3?\nF(3) = 1 + F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7\n\nSo with 7 players, the winner can play 3 games.\n\nSimilarly, k=4: F(4)=1+F(3)+F(2)=1+7+4=12.\n\nWe are given n (the total players). We want to find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\nBut note: the tournament must have at least k+1 players (the winner plus k opponents). And we are building the minimal structure for k games.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given n, find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\nBut note: the recurrence is similar to the Fibonacci numbers, but starting from:\n\nk:   F(k)\n0    1\n1    2\n2    4\n3    7\n4    12\n5    20\n6    33\n7    54\n8    88\n...\n\nWe can use a loop to compute F(k) until we exceed n (which can be up to 10^18). But note: k will be at most around 100 (since Fibonacci grows exponentially, 10^18 is about the 90th Fibonacci number in base 1.618...).\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read n (as integer, which can be up to 10^18)\n2. We want to find the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\nBut note: we have defined F(0)=1, F(1)=2, and for k>=2: F(k)=1+F(k-1)+F(k-2)\n\nBut wait: is this correct? Let me check with the examples:\n\nExample n=2: \n  k=0: F(0)=1 <=2 -> valid, but we can have k=1: F(1)=2<=2 -> valid, k=2: F(2)=4>2 -> so maximum k=1 -> output 1. Correct.\n\nExample n=3:\n  k=0: 1<=3\n  k=1: 2<=3\n  k=2: 4>3 -> so maximum k=1? But expected output is 2.\n\nWait, wait! There is a misunderstanding.\n\nIn the example n=3, the winner plays 2 games. So k=2. But according to our F(2)=4, which is greater than 3. This implies that the minimal structure for 2 games is 4 players, but we have only 3. How did the example work?\n\nLet me reexamine the example n=3:\n\nWe have three players: A (winner), B, C.\n\nWe can arrange the tournament as:\n  First, A plays B -> A wins (now A has 1 game)\n  Then, A plays C -> A wins (now A has 2 games)\n\nBut wait, the rule says: two players can play if the number of games they have played differs by at most one.\n\nIn the second game, A has 1 game and C has 0 games. The difference is 1, which is allowed.\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nGame1: A vs B -> A wins (B leaves, A now has 1 game)\nGame2: A vs C -> A wins (C leaves, A now has 2 games)\n\nTotal players: 3, and the winner played 2 games.\n\nBut our recurrence F(k) was defined as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games. In the above, we used 3 players for 2 games.\n\nSo what is the recurrence?\n\nActually, the recurrence I thought (F(k)=1+F(k-1)+F(k-2)) was for a different interpretation: that the two opponents (for the k-th game) must have come from two separate subtrees. But in reality, the two opponents (in the k-1 and k-2 games) are independent, but we don't necessarily need two entire subtrees. \n\nAlternatively, we can define:\n\nLet G(k) be the minimal number of players required so that the winner can play k games.\n\nHow to form the tournament for k games?\n\nThe winner must face k opponents. Each opponent must have been the winner of a subtree. The condition for the k-th opponent: the winner has k-1 games, so the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nBut note: the entire set of players is the winner plus the players in the subtrees of the opponents.\n\nHowever, the subtrees for the opponents are independent, but the condition on the number of games for the opponent at the k-th game is that the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games (so that the difference is at most one). \n\nBut we are free to choose the structure for the entire tournament. To minimize the total number of players, we can use the same structure for the opponent's path.\n\nActually, the minimal structure for the opponent that has played x games is that the opponent must have come from a tournament of size G(x). \n\nBut note: the winner's k-1 wins are against k-1 opponents. The last opponent (the k-th) is the one that gives the k-th win, and that opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nWe can consider two possibilities for the last opponent:\n\nPossibility 1: The last opponent has played k-1 games (so the opponent is the winner of a tournament that required G(k-1) players). Then the total players is 1 (the overall winner) + the players from the last opponent's tournament (G(k-1)) + the players from the previous k-1 wins (but wait, the previous k-1 wins are against k-1 opponents, each of which must have been the winner of a tournament. However, the entire tournament is built by having the winner face one opponent at a time, and the opponent must have been obtained from a subtree.\n\nBut note: the winner's first opponent must have played 0 games (so the subtree for the first opponent is just 1 player). The second opponent must have played 0 or 1 game. \n\nActually, we can break the tournament as:\n\n- The winner plays the first opponent (who has 0 games) -> then the winner has 1 game.\n- Then the winner plays the second opponent (who must have 0 or 1 game). To minimize the total number of players, we can have the second opponent be from a subtree that requires minimal players. The minimal for 1 game is G(1)=2 (the winner of a 2-player tournament). But wait, we already have the first opponent (so we cannot reuse that). Alternatively, we can have the second opponent be the first opponent's opponent? Actually, no, because the first opponent lost to the overall winner.\n\nWait, maybe we should define:\n\nLet H(k) be the minimal number of players required for a tournament where the winner plays exactly k games and the entire tournament is built under the rule.\n\nThen, the winner must have k wins. The k wins must be against k distinct opponents. The entire set of players is the winner and the k opponents, and the opponents must have been obtained from their own subtrees.\n\nBut the condition: the k-th opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. \n\nWe can consider two cases for the last opponent:\n\nCase 1: The last opponent has played k-1 games. Then the opponent is the winner of a tournament of H(k-1) players. Then the total players is 1 (the overall winner) + the players from the last opponent's tournament (H(k-1)) + the players from the first k-1 opponents' tournaments.\n\nBut note: the first k-1 opponents are the ones the winner beat in the previous games, and each of those opponents must have been the winner of a tournament. However, the structure is such that the winner's path is sequential.\n\nActually, we can use the following:\n\nLet H(0) = 1 (no game, only the winner)\nH(1) = 2 (the winner and one opponent)\n\nFor k>=2, the k-th game is played by the winner against an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nBut we are trying to minimize the total number of players. Therefore, we can choose the opponent that requires the least players.\n\nHowever, note that the entire tournament must be consistent. The winner must have played k-1 games before the k-th, and the opponent for the k-th game must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nBut the minimal structure for the k-th opponent is:\n\nIf we choose the opponent with k-1 games, then the opponent's tournament had H(k-1) players, but note: the winner's previous k-1 wins must have been against other opponents. The total players would be:\n\n  H(k) = 1 + min( H(k-1) + H(k-2), ... )   ??? \n\nWait, actually the entire tournament is built by:\n\n- The winner has k wins. The last win (k-th) is against an opponent A who has either k-1 or k-2 wins.\n- The first k-1 wins are against k-1 opponents (say B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1}).\n\nBut the opponent A (for the k-th win) must have come from a subtree that is independent of the previous k-1 opponents (because the previous k-1 opponents are already eliminated). However, the entire set of players is the winner and all the players that ever participated (including the ones that were eliminated in the subtrees).\n\nSo the total players is:\n\n  H(k) = 1 + (players in the subtree for A) + (players in the subtrees for the first k-1 opponents)\n\nBut the first k-1 opponents are the ones the winner beat in the previous k-1 games, and each of those opponents must have been the winner of a subtree. However, the structure of the entire tournament is such that the winner faces one opponent at a time, and the opponent must have been prepared by a tournament.\n\nBut note: the rule allows the pairing condition, so the entire tournament can be arranged arbitrarily as long as the condition holds.\n\nActually, the minimal structure for k games is:\n\n  H(0) = 1\n  H(1) = 2\n  For k>=2, the k-th game must be against an opponent that has either k-1 or k-2 wins. \n\nBut the entire tournament must have:\n\n  - The winner (1 player)\n  - The opponent for the k-th game (with either k-1 or k-2 wins) and the players that formed that opponent's tournament (H(opponent_wins) - 1? because the opponent is the winner of that tournament, so the tournament had H(opponent_wins) players, but we count the opponent as the winner and the others as the rest).\n\nBut wait, the entire tournament is the winner and the players from the k subtrees (one for each opponent). The minimal number of players for the entire tournament is:\n\n  H(k) = 1 + H(a) + H(b)   [but a and b are the wins of the two last opponents?]\n\nActually, we have to consider the entire history. The tournament is built by:\n\n  - The winner's first opponent: a tournament of H(0) = 1 player (just the opponent, because the opponent has 0 wins). Then the winner has 1 win.\n  - Then, to get the second win, the next opponent must have 0 or 1 wins. But if we choose 0 wins, then that opponent is from a fresh tournament of 1 player (so total players becomes 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 1 (second opponent) = 3). But then the winner has two wins. However, the rule for the second game: the winner has 1 game, the second opponent has 0 -> allowed.\n\nBut wait, we can also choose the second opponent from the first opponent's remaining players? Actually, no: the first opponent is eliminated, so the second opponent must be a new player. So minimal for 2 games is 3 players.\n\nThen H(2)=3.\n\nBut then the example n=3: the winner can play 2 games, so k=2, and we require 3 players. Then we can say that the condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, for k=3:\n\nThe third game: the winner has 2 wins. The next opponent must have either 2 or 1 wins.\n\nOption 1: opponent has 2 wins -> then the minimal players for that opponent's tournament is H(2)=3. Then the total players is 1 (winner) + H(2) (the opponent's tournament) + the players from the first two wins? But wait, the first two wins: the first opponent had 0 wins (so 1 player) and the second opponent had 0 wins (so 1 player) OR the second opponent could have 1 win (then the minimal for that opponent's tournament is H(1)=2). \n\nActually, we have two possibilities for the second game: the second opponent could have been from a 1-win tournament (so 2 players) or from a 0-win tournament (1 player). \n\nBut to minimize the total players for k=3, we choose the minimal option for the second game and the third game.\n\nHowever, the entire tournament must be built sequentially. The winner's first opponent (from a 0-win tournament) and then the second opponent must be from a tournament that the opponent won, and the opponent's wins count must be either 0 or 1. \n\nBut note: the condition for the second game: the winner has 1 game, the second opponent must have 0 or 1 games. \n\nAnd for the third game: the winner has 2 games, the third opponent must have 1 or 2 games.\n\nWe can combine the two possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1: The second opponent has 0 wins (so 1 player) and the third opponent has 1 win (so 2 players). Then total players = 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 1 (second opponent) + 2 (third opponent's players) = 5.\n\nPossibility 2: The second opponent has 1 win (so 2 players) and the third opponent has 2 wins (so 3 players). Then total players = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\nPossibility 3: The second opponent has 1 win (so 2 players) and the third opponent has 1 win (so 2 players). Then total players = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\nBut wait, the second opponent is the one the winner beat in the second game, and the third opponent is the one beaten in the third game. The entire tournament must have the winner and the players from the two opponents and their respective subtrees.\n\nBut note: the first opponent (0 wins) is one player. The second opponent (1 win) is the winner of a two-player tournament (so one other player). The third opponent (1 win) is the winner of a two-player tournament (so one other player). However, we cannot reuse the same player for multiple roles. So the total players is:\n\n  Winner: 1\n  First opponent: 1 (from a 0-win tournament)\n  Second opponent: 1 (the other player in the two-player tournament for the second opponent) \n  Third opponent: 1 (the other player in the two-player tournament for the third opponent)\n\nWait, no: the second opponent's tournament requires 2 players (the second opponent and one other). Similarly, the third opponent's tournament requires 2 players (the third opponent and one other). \n\nBut the first opponent is one player. Then we have:\n\n  Total players = 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 1 (the other in the second opponent's tournament) + 1 (the other in the third opponent's tournament) + 1 (the third opponent) ?\n\nActually, the second opponent is one player (the winner of a two-player tournament) and that two-player tournament has two players: the second opponent and one more (who lost to the second opponent). Similarly, the third opponent is one player and the other one in the third opponent's tournament is an additional player.\n\nSo:\n\n  Winner: 1\n  First opponent: 1 (and no one else, because the tournament for 0 wins is just that one player)\n  Second opponent: 2 players (the second opponent and one more)\n  Third opponent: 2 players (the third opponent and one more)\n\nBut wait, the second opponent is already counted in the two-player tournament. Similarly, the third opponent is already counted.\n\nActually, the entire set is:\n\n  {Winner, first_opponent, second_opponent, second_opponent_subopponent, third_opponent, third_opponent_subopponent}\n\nSo total 6 players? \n\nBut wait, the two-player tournament for the second opponent: that tournament is separate from the first opponent. Similarly, the third opponent's tournament is separate.\n\nBut note: the first opponent is eliminated immediately, so we don't need to consider that first opponent having any further matches. \n\nSo the total players is:\n\n  Winner: 1\n  First opponent: 1\n  Second opponent's tournament: 2 (which includes the second opponent and one more)\n  Third opponent's tournament: 2 (which includes the third opponent and one more)\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nBut we found a possibility with 5 players above (by mixing the wins). How?\n\nPossibility 3: \n  Second opponent has 1 win (so the second opponent's tournament requires 2 players: the second opponent and one other)\n  Third opponent has 1 win (so the third opponent's tournament requires 2 players: the third opponent and one other)\n\nBut then the total players is 1 (winner) + 1 (first opponent) + 2 (second opponent's) + 2 (third opponent's) = 6.\n\nWait, but in the example with 3 players, we had:\n\n  Players: A (winner), B, C.\n\n  We did two games: \n      Game1: A vs B -> A wins (B is eliminated)\n      Game2: A vs C -> A wins (C is eliminated)\n\nThis uses 3 players. In this structure, the second opponent (C) has 0 wins. So that is Possibility 1: second opponent 0 wins, third opponent 1 win? Actually, no: we only have two games, so the second opponent (C) has 0 wins. Then why did I consider the third opponent? \n\nWait, for k=2, the two wins. The second game: the opponent (C) has 0 wins. Then the condition is satisfied (difference 1). \n\nSo the total players for k=2 is 3.\n\nBut how did we get 3? \n\n  Winner: 1\n  First opponent: 1 (B)\n  Second opponent: 1 (C)\n\nBut wait, the second opponent (C) is a separate player. So we don't need to account for a subtree for C because C hasn't played any game. \n\nSo the minimal structure for k=2 is:\n\n  First opponent: from a tournament of 1 player (so 1 player)\n  Second opponent: from a tournament of 1 player (so 1 player)\n\nTotal players: 1 (winner) + 1 (first) + 1 (second) = 3.\n\nBut note: the condition for the second game: the winner has 1 game and the second opponent has 0 -> allowed.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence is:\n\nLet H(0) = 1 (only the winner, no games)\nH(1) = 2 (winner and one opponent with 0 games)\n\nFor k>=2, the k-th game can be against an opponent that has either k-1 or k-2 games. The minimal total players for k games is:\n\n  H(k) = 1 + min( H(k-1), H(k-2) )   ??? \n\nWait, no. Actually, the entire tournament for k games requires:\n\n  - The winner (1)\n  - The k opponents, each of whom must be the winner of a tournament. The minimal structure for an opponent with i games is H(i) players (the opponent and the players in his subtree). But note: the same player cannot be reused.\n\nHowever, the entire tournament is built by the winner defeating k opponents, and each opponent's tournament is independent. Therefore, the total players is:\n\n  H(k) = 1 + (number of players in the first opponent's tournament) + (number of players in the second opponent's tournament) + ... + (number of players in the k-th opponent's tournament)\n\nBut the i-th opponent must have played a certain number of games (say, a_i) and the minimal number of players for that opponent's tournament is H(a_i). \n\nBut we are free to choose the a_i (either k-1 or k-2 for the last one) and for the previous ones, we must have chosen a sequence that satisfies the condition (the condition for the j-th game: the j-th opponent must have played either j-1 or j-2 games). \n\nBut to minimize the total number of players, we would choose the minimal H(a_i) for each opponent.\n\nHowever, the wins counts for the opponents are constrained by the rule: the j-th opponent must have played either j-1 or j-2 games (at the moment of the j-th game, the winner has j-1 wins and the opponent must have j-1 or j-2 wins).\n\nTherefore, the minimal structure for k games is:\n\n  H(0) = 1\n  H(1) = 2\n\n  For k>=2, we have two options for the last opponent (the k-th): either k-1 or k-2 wins.\n\n  Then, the total players for k games is 1 (the winner) + the minimal total players we can get by combining the last opponent's tournament and the previous k-1 opponents.\n\nBut note: the previous k-1 opponents are not necessarily from minimal structures. We need to consider the entire sequence.\n\nAlternatively, we can define:\n\n  Let H(k) = 1 + min( H(k-1), H(k-2) )   -> but that doesn't work because the entire tournament requires more.\n\nActually, we must consider that the entire tournament is built by the winner and the k opponents, and each opponent's tournament requires H(a_i) players. The minimal total players is the sum of the minimal players for each of the k opponents' tournaments plus the winner.\n\nBut note: the same player cannot be reused. So the total is:\n\n  H(k) = 1 + (minimal total players from the k opponents' tournaments)\n\nAnd the minimal total players from the k opponents' tournaments is the sum of the minimal players for each opponent's tournament.\n\nBut what is the minimal players for an opponent that must have played a certain number of games? It is H(i) for i being the number of wins.\n\nHowever, we are constrained by the sequence: the i-th opponent must have played either i-1 or i-2 games.\n\nTherefore, we can use dynamic programming to compute the minimal total players for k games.\n\nBut note: the number of games k can be large (since n up to 10^18, k is about O(log_phi(n)) which is around 100). We can iterate.\n\nBut the recurrence for the minimal players for k games is:\n\n  Let dp[0] = 1   (0 games: only the winner)\n  Let dp[1] = 2   (1 game: the winner and one opponent)\n\n  For k>=2, the k-th game can be arranged with an opponent that has played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\n  However, the entire tournament for k games is not simply the sum of the minimal players for the last opponent and the previous k-1 games. \n\nWait, let me define:\n\n  Let F(k) = minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games.\n\n  Then, the k-th game is against an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. But the entire tournament for k games must include:\n\n      - The winner (1 player)\n      - The k opponents, each of which is the winner of a subtree.\n\n  However, the subtrees for the opponents are independent, but the wins counts for the opponents are fixed by the rule.\n\n  Specifically, the opponent for the k-th game must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. \n\n  But the minimal structure for an opponent that has played x games is F(x) players.\n\n  Additionally, the previous k-1 wins are against k-1 opponents, and each of those opponents must have been the winner of a tournament (with their own wins counts). \n\n  However, we don't need to know the entire history, but we know that the minimal number of players required for k games is the minimal over the two choices for the last opponent, combined with the minimal number for the remaining k-1 games.\n\n  But note: the entire tournament is built sequentially. The last opponent's tournament is independent of the previous ones. \n\n  Therefore, the total players is:\n\n      F(k) = 1 + min( F(k-1), F(k-2) )   ??\n\n  But wait, no. The last opponent's tournament requires F(x) players (where x is the wins of that opponent). But the last opponent's wins count is either k-1 or k-2, so the minimal players for the last opponent's tournament is min(F(k-1), F(k-2)).\n\n  However, the previous k-1 wins are against k-1 opponents, and each of those opponents must have been obtained from a tournament. But the total players is the winner plus the players from all the subtrees.\n\n  But the subtrees for the previous k-1 opponents are already accounted for in F(k-1) or F(k-2)? Actually, no.\n\n  Let me try with k=2:\n\n      F(2) = 1 + min(F(1), F(0)) = 1 + min(2,1) = 1+1 = 2.\n\n  But we know that for k=2 we need 3 players.\n\n  Why is that? Because the two opponents (for the two wins) are two separate players, so we need:\n\n      winner: 1\n      first opponent: 1 (from a tournament of 1 player)\n      second opponent: 1 (from a tournament of 1 player)\n\n  Total 3.\n\n  So the minimal structure for k=2 is 3.\n\n  How to account for the two opponents? \n\n  We must consider that the entire tournament has:\n\n      F(k) = 1 + (sum over all opponents' subtrees)\n\n  But the two opponents' subtrees are of size F(0) and F(0) (since both have 0 wins). And F(0)=1, so the total would be 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\n  Similarly, for k=3:\n\n      Option 1: last opponent has 2 wins -> subtree size F(2)=3, and the two previous opponents have 0 and 1 wins? \n\n  But wait, the previous two wins: the first win: opponent has 0 wins -> F(0)=1\n                the second win: opponent has 1 win -> F(1)=2\n                the third win: opponent has 2 wins -> F(2)=3\n\n      Then total players = 1 + 1 (first) + 2 (second) + 3 (third) = 7.\n\n  Option 2: last opponent has 1 win -> F(1)=2, and the two previous wins: \n                first: 0 wins -> F(0)=1\n                second: 1 win -> F(1)=2\n                third: 1 win -> F(1)=2\n            total = 1 + 1+2+2 = 6.\n\n  But is option 2 valid? \n\n      Game1: winner beats an opponent with 0 wins (so a 1-player tournament) -> winner has 1 win.\n      Game2: winner beats an opponent with 1 win. How can we have an opponent with 1 win? That opponent must have won one game. But the only players available are the ones not yet eliminated. Initially, we have the winner and the two opponents from the first game (already eliminated) and the other players. \n\n      Actually, we need to have a separate subtree for the second opponent: a 2-player tournament (the second opponent and one more). Then the second opponent has 1 win.\n\n      Then, the third game: the winner plays the third opponent, who must have either 1 or 2 wins. We choose 1 win. So the third opponent must be the winner of a 2-player tournament (so one more player). \n\n      Total players: winner (1) + first opponent (1) + the extra player in the second opponent's subtree (1) + second opponent (1) + the extra player in the third opponent's subtree (1) + third opponent (1) = 6.\n\n  Now, is this arrangement",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament follows a knockout format where the winner must win all their games. The key constraint is that each opponent the winner faces must have a number of previous games that differs by at most one from the winner's current number of games. This means the winner can strategically choose opponents to maximize their own game count.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the minimal number of players required for the winner to play \\( k \\) games does not exceed \\( n \\). The minimal number of players for \\( k \\) games follows a recurrence relation similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each term depends on the previous two terms.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to compute the minimal number of players required for each possible \\( k \\) (number of games the winner plays). The recurrence relation is \\( F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2) \\), with base cases \\( F(0) = 1 \\) (no games, just the winner) and \\( F(1) = 2 \\) (one game, winner and one opponent).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Given the constraints \\( 2 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18} \\), the algorithm efficiently computes the result by iterating until \\( F(k) \\) exceeds \\( n \\), leveraging the exponential growth of \\( F(k) \\) to ensure logarithmic time complexity relative to \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    a, b = 1, 2\n    k = 1\n    \n    while b < n:\n        next_val = a + b\n        a, b = b, next_val\n        k += 1\n        \n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input integer \\( n \\), which represents the number of players.\n2. **Base Case Handling**: If \\( n \\) is 2, the output is 1 because the winner can only play one game.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Two variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 1 and 2, representing the minimal players needed for 0 and 1 games respectively. The variable `k` keeps track of the current number of games being considered.\n4. **Loop Until Condition Met**: The loop continues to compute the next value in the sequence (similar to Fibonacci) by summing the previous two values. This value represents the minimal players needed for \\( k+1 \\) games. The loop exits when this value exceeds \\( n \\).\n5. **Output Result**: The value of `k` at the end of the loop gives the maximum number of games the winner can play without exceeding the player limit \\( n \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of the sequence derived from the problem's constraints, ensuring optimal performance even for very large \\( n \\).",
