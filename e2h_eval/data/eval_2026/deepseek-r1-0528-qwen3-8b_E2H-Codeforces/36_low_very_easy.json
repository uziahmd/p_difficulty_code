The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe have n+2 towns (from 0 to n+1) and we build a tower in each town i (for i from 1 to n) with probability 1/2 independently.\n\nConstraints for the signal power setting:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal.\n2. Each town from 1 to n must get exactly one radio tower's signal.\n\nHow does the signal work?\nA tower at town i with power p reaches cities c such that |c - i| < p.\n\nNote: The towns are located at integer coordinates: town 0 at 0, town 1 at 1, ..., town n+1 at n+1.\n\nWe need to compute the probability that there exists an assignment of signal powers (each from 1 to n) satisfying the constraints.\n\nObservation:\n\nThe constraints require that:\n- Town 0 is not covered by any tower. This means that no tower can cover town 0. \n  Since a tower at town i covers town 0 if |0 - i| < p, i.e., i < p. So for a tower at i, we must have p > i (to not cover 0). But note: the condition is strict inequality, so if p = i+1 then |0-i| = i < i+1 -> covers 0. Actually, to avoid covering town 0, the tower at i must have p <= i. However, wait: the condition is |c-i| < p. For town 0: |0-i| = i. So we require i >= p. But also, we don't want to cover town 0, so we require that the tower at i does not cover town 0, i.e., i >= p. However, note that if i=0, but we don't have a tower at 0. So for a tower at i (which is between 1 and n), we must set p <= i to avoid covering town 0? Actually, no: because if p <= i, then |0-i| = i >= p, so it doesn't cover. But wait: the condition is strictly less than p. So if p <= i, then i is not < p? Actually, if p <= i, then i >= p, so |0-i| = i >= p, hence 0 is not covered. However, we also have to consider the other constraint: the towers must cover their own segment and not interfere with others.\n\nBut there's another constraint: each town j (from 1 to n) must be covered by exactly one tower.\n\nConsider town j. It must be covered by exactly one tower. Which tower can cover town j?\n- A tower at i can cover j if |j-i| < p. Also, note that the same town j must not be covered by two different towers.\n\nMoreover, we must ensure that town n+1 is not covered. Similarly, for a tower at i, to not cover town n+1 (located at n+1), we require |n+1 - i| >= p. Since |n+1 - i| = n+1-i (if i <= n) and we know i is at most n, so n+1-i >= 1. But note: we can choose p arbitrarily (from 1 to n). However, we have two constraints for each tower: \n- To avoid covering town 0: p <= i.\n- To avoid covering town n+1: p <= n+1 - i.\n\nWait, but note: if we set p too low, then we might not cover the required towns. Alternatively, we can think about the necessary conditions for the existence of an assignment.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem is symmetric. We are essentially requiring that the entire set of built towers (which are in towns 1..n) must form a \"covering\" of the towns 1..n such that each town is covered by exactly one tower and the two endpoints 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nBut note: the condition for a tower at i to cover a town j is |i-j| < p. This is equivalent to j being in the open interval (i-p, i+p).\n\nNow, note that the problem is similar to having a set of intervals (one per tower) that must cover the set {1,2,...,n} exactly once and must not extend beyond [1, n] (because they must not cover 0 or n+1). However, the intervals must be chosen from the set of available signal powers (from 1 to n) and we can assign independently.\n\nBut note: the same signal power can be used multiple times.\n\nHowever, the key is to find the necessary conditions on the set S of built towers (i.e., which towns have a tower) such that there exists an assignment.\n\nLet me consider the example",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns (from 1 to n) with independent probability 1/2 each, there exists a way to set signal powers for these towers such that:\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower.\n2. Each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - Each town from 1 to n has a tower built with probability 1/2 independently.\n   - The signal from a tower at position `i` with power `p` covers all towns `c` where `|c - i| < p`.\n   - To satisfy the constraints:\n     - Town 0 must not be covered by any tower. This requires that for every tower at position `i`, the signal power `p` must be ≤ `i` (since `|0 - i| = i` must not be less than `p`).\n     - Similarly, town `n+1` must not be covered, requiring `p` ≤ `n+1 - i` for each tower at `i`.\n     - Each town `j` (from 1 to n) must be covered by exactly one tower. This means the intervals defined by the towers must cover each `j` exactly once without overlapping in a way that violates the coverage condition.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The problem reduces to ensuring that the set of built towers forms a structure where each segment between consecutive towns can be uniquely assigned to a tower without violating the coverage constraints. Specifically, for the assignment to be possible, the built towers must include at least one tower in certain critical positions. \n\n3. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - The solution involves identifying the number of favorable subsets of towers (built or not) that allow a valid signal power assignment. The probability is then the ratio of the number of favorable subsets to the total number of possible subsets (which is \\(2^n\\)), modulo 998244353.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming**:\n   - We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations. The DP state tracks the last two decisions (whether towers were built in the previous two towns) and ensures that the coverage conditions are met. The transitions consider whether to build a tower in the current town and adjust the DP state accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    \n    dp0 = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp1 = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp2 = [0] * (n + 2)\n    \n    dp0[0] = 1\n    dp1[0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 2):\n        if i == 1:\n            dp0[i] = 1\n            dp1[i] = 1\n            continue\n        \n        new_dp0 = 0\n        new_dp1 = 0\n        \n        if dp0[i - 1]:\n            new_dp0 = (new_dp0 + dp0[i - 1]) % MOD\n            new_dp1 = (new_dp1 + dp0[i - 1]) % MOD\n            \n        if dp1[i - 1]:\n            new_dp0 = (new_dp0 + dp1[i - 1]) % MOD\n            new_dp1 = (new_dp1 + dp1[i - 1]) % MOD\n            \n        if dp2[i - 1]:\n            new_dp0 = (new_dp0 + dp2[i - 1]) % MOD\n            \n        dp2[i - 1] = (dp2[i - 1] + dp1[i - 1]) % MOD\n        \n        dp0[i] = new_dp0\n        dp1[i] = new_dp1\n    \n    total_favorable = (dp0[n + 1] + dp1[n + 1]) % MOD\n    total_possible = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    ans = total_favorable * pow(total_possible, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The code reads the input value `n` which represents the number of towns from 1 to n.\n- **Dynamic Programming Arrays**: Three arrays (`dp0`, `dp1`, `dp2`) are used to keep track of the number of valid configurations up to each town. These arrays help in efficiently counting the valid subsets of towers that meet the coverage conditions.\n- **DP Transitions**: For each town, the code updates the DP arrays based on whether a tower was built in the previous towns. The transitions ensure that the coverage constraints are satisfied by considering the necessary conditions for each town's coverage.\n- **Result Calculation**: The total number of favorable configurations is derived from the DP arrays, and the result is computed as the probability (favorable configurations divided by total possible configurations) modulo 998244353 using modular arithmetic.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid configurations using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, providing the desired probability in the required form.",
