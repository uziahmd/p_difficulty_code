For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of three notes. The notes are from the set: ['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','B','H'] (12 notes)\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (0 to 11) representing the semitone index starting from C=0.\n    Note: The problem states that the notes repeat cyclically, and we start at C.\n\n 2. Since the chord is an unordered set, we can consider all permutations of the three notes.\n\n 3. For a given ordering [a, b, c] (each note represented as a number), we can check the intervals:\n    - Interval from a to b: (b - a) mod 12 (but we need to account for circularity) -> but note: the problem says we take the distance from the lowest to the highest, but wait: in the example, E to C is 8 semitones? Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone\" but then they use integers for semitones.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"C E G\" -> major: \n        C to E: 4 semitones (because C->C#=1, C->D=2, C->D#=3, C->E=4)\n        E to G: 3 semitones (E->F=1, F->F#=2, F->G=3)\n\n But also note: the problem says the distance from E to C is 8 semitones? That is because going from E to C in the upward direction (cyclic) would be: \n        E->F, F->F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C -> 7 steps? Actually, from E to C: \n        E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C -> that's 8 semitones? Actually, the example says \"between E and C is 8 semitones\", so we are taking the upward distance if we go from a lower note to a higher note? But wait, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". \n\n However, in our chord definition, we are to order the notes so that the distances are as specified. So we have to consider the cyclic nature.\n\n But note: In music, the chord is defined by the intervals in the scale. We have to consider the smallest circle that contains the three notes, and then check the consecutive intervals.\n\n However, the problem states: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major.\"\n\n How to compute the distance from note A to note B?\n   Let base_note = 0 for 'C', then 'C#' is 1, ... 'H' is 11.\n\n   Then the distance from A to B (in semitones) is (B - A) % 12, but then we must consider that if (B - A) is negative, we add 12. However, the problem says the distance from E to C is 8. Let's see:\n\n   E is 4 (since C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3, E=4). Then C is 0. So (0 - 4) % 12 = (-4) % 12 = 8. So that matches.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". This implies that we are always measuring in the positive direction (from a lower note to a higher note). However, in the chord definition, we are allowed to reorder the notes arbitrarily.\n\n   So we can assign numbers to the three notes and then consider the three possible cyclic orders.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    - Map the input notes to their corresponding numbers.\n\n    - Then, we can consider the three notes as points on a circle (with 12 points). We can fix one note as the starting point and then check the two possible orderings that start with that note and continue in increasing order (modulo 12).\n\n    Alternatively, we can generate all 6 permutations and check the two conditions (major and minor) for each consecutive pair (with wrapping).\n\n    However, note: the condition requires three consecutive notes (X, Y, Z) such that the first interval is 4 semitones and the second is 3, OR the first is 3 and the second is 4.\n\n    But wait, the problem says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\" for major.\n\n    We can do:\n\n        Let the three notes be a, b, c (as numbers). We can consider the sorted order (in the circle) and then the two possibilities: \n        Possibility 1: Start at the smallest, then next, then next (wrapping if necessary). But note: the circle is 12, so we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Sort the three numbers, but since it's a circle, we might break the circle at the smallest note? Actually, we can consider the three gaps.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let the three notes be represented as numbers: n1, n2, n3.\n\n        We can arrange them in sorted order (without circularity) and then consider the gaps. But wait, the chord may wrap around.\n\n        Example: ['C', 'E', 'G'] -> [0,4,7]\n        Example: ['C#', 'B', 'F'] -> [1, 11, 5]. Now, if we sort: [1,5,11] -> then the gaps: from 1 to 5: 4, from 5 to 11: 6, from 11 to 1+12=13: 2. That doesn't work.\n\n        Instead, we can consider the circular arrangement. We can normalize the three notes so that we start from the minimum and then add 12 to the others if necessary? Or we can consider the three possible starting points.\n\n        Better: Generate all 6 permutations and check the two conditions (for major and minor) for each consecutive pair (including the wrap from last to first? no, because the chord definition has three distinct notes and the condition is about three consecutive intervals that form a cycle? Actually, the condition only requires the two intervals: from X to Y and from Y to Z, and then implicitly the third interval (X to Z) is 7 (which is 4+3) but the problem doesn't require checking the entire cycle, just the two given.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"an unordered set\", so we are free to choose the order. We are to check if there exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that:\n            Condition for major: (Y - X) % 12 == 4 and (Z - Y) % 12 == 3.\n            Condition for minor: (Y - X) % 12 == 3 and (Z - Y) % 12 == 4.\n\n        But note: the modulus operation: we must ensure that we are taking the minimal positive representation.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the direction (ascending or descending). But the definition says \"along the musical scale\" from the lowest to the uppest. So we are only concerned with the positive distances (i.e., moving forward by the specified number of semitones). \n\n        But wait: the example says \"between E and C is 8\", meaning that when we are considering E to C, we are going from E to C in the upward direction? Actually, the problem says \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\", but then in the chord definition, we are ordering the notes so that the first interval is 4 and the second is 3. In the chord \"C E G\", we don't use the distance from E to C, we use the distance from C to E and then from E to G.\n\n        So in the chord, we are not necessarily going in the upward direction without wrapping? Actually, the definition says \"if we can order the notes\", meaning we can arrange them in any order (so we can break the circle arbitrarily). \n\n        Therefore, we can consider the three notes as a set and try every permutation (order) and check the condition.\n\n        Steps for a given permutation [a, b, c]:\n          Condition for major: \n            (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3\n\n          Condition for minor:\n            (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4\n\n        But wait: what if the ordering wraps around? Example: [11, 0, 3] (which corresponds to B, C, D#). Then:\n          Condition for major: \n            (0 - 11) % 12 = (0 - 11 + 12) % 12 = 1 -> not 4.\n            (3 - 0) % 12 = 3 -> not 3.\n\n        However, we can also consider the ordering [0, 3, 11]: \n            (3-0)%12=3, (11-3)%12=8 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n        Another ordering: [0, 3, 11] doesn't work. What about [3, 0, 11]? \n            (0-3)%12 = (0-3+12)%12=9 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n        But wait, the chord [B, C, D#] is not a major or minor? \n\n        Actually, the chord [B, C, D#] is a minor chord? Let me check: \n            In music theory, a minor chord is defined by root, then minor third (3 semitones) then major third (4 semitones). \n            If we take the root as C, then the notes are C, E♭ (which is D#), and G. But here we have B, C, D#. \n\n        How do we identify the root? The root is the note from which we measure the intervals. \n\n        However, the problem states: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 3 semitones and between Y and Z equals 4 semitones, then the triad is minor.\"\n\n        So we need to find an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the first interval is 3 and the second is 4. \n\n        In [B, C, D#]:\n            Ordering: [C, D#, B] -> \n                From C to D#: (D# - C) = 3 semitones? \n                    C=0, C#=1, D=2, D#=3 -> yes, 3 semitones.\n                Then from D# to B: (B - D#) mod 12: B is 10, D# is 3 -> (10 - 3) = 7 -> not 4.\n\n            Ordering: [B, C, D#]: \n                From B to C: (0 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 2 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n            Ordering: [C, B, D#]: \n                From C to B: (10 - 0) %12 = 10 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n            Ordering: [D#, B, C]:\n                From D# to B: (10 - 3) %12 = 7 -> not 3 or 4.\n                From B to C: (0 - 10 + 12) %12 = 2 -> not 4.\n\n            Ordering: [B, D#, C]:\n                From B to D#: (3 - 10 + 12) %12 = 5 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n            Ordering: [D#, C, B]:\n                From D# to C: (0 - 3 + 12) %12 = 9 -> not 3 or 4.\n\n        So [B, C, D#] is not recognized as minor? \n\n        Let me check the example: \"C# B F\" is minor. The example says: ordered as \"B C# F\": \n            B to C#: (C# - B) = (1 - 10 + 12) %12 = (1 - 10) %12 = (1 + 2) %12? Wait, no: (1 - 10) %12 = (1 - 10) = -9, then -9 %12 = 3. So 3 semitones, then C# to F: (F is 5, C# is 1) -> (5-1)=4. So that works.\n\n        But for [B, C, D#] we didn't find an ordering. \n\n        However, let me re-map: \n            B -> 10, C -> 0, D# -> 3.\n\n        Now, if we take the ordering [0, 3, 10] (C, D#, B):\n            C to D#: 3 (correct for minor first interval)\n            D# to B: (10 - 3) %12 = 7 -> which is 7, not 4.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the distance from Y to Z is taken from the lowest to the uppest. However, in the chord definition, we are allowed to break the circle arbitrarily. The condition for minor requires the two intervals to be 3 and 4, but note that the entire chord spans 7 semitones from the root? \n\n        Actually, the chord [C, D#, B] is actually a minor chord? Because the root is C, then D# is a minor third above C (because C to D# is 3 semitones: C->C#->D->D# -> wait, no: C to D# is 3 semitones? \n            C to C# is 1, C# to D is 2, D to D# is 3 -> so yes, 3 semitones from C to D# is a minor third. Then from D# to B: \n            D# to E is 1, E to F is 2, F to F# is 3, F# to G is 4, G to G# is 5, G# to A is 6, A to B is 7 -> so from D# to B is 7 semitones? \n\n        But wait, the minor chord is defined as root, minor third, and then major third (which is 4 semitones from the root). So the total span from root to fifth should be 7 semitones. But in this case, from C to the fifth (which should be G) is 7 semitones (C->E♭ is 3, then E♭->G is 4, total 7). But here the fifth is B? \n\n        Actually, the chord [C, D#, B] is not a standard minor chord. The standard minor chord on C is [C, Eb, G]. Here we have [C, D#, B] which is [C, E♭, B]. B is the seventh of the C major scale, not the fifth. \n\n        Therefore, [B, C, D#] is not a minor chord? \n\n        The problem says: \"Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes.\" and defines major and minor by the two interval conditions.\n\n        So the chord must have two intervals (in some consecutive ordering) of 3 and 4 (or 4 and 3) and the third interval (from the first to the last) is 7.\n\n        However, note: the condition does not require the entire chord to be within 12 semitones? Actually, the condition is local: we are only concerned with the two consecutive intervals (from X to Y and Y to Z). The third interval (X to Z) is implicitly defined (and must be 7 for major, and 7 for minor as well? because 3+4=7). \n\n        But in the example [B, C, D#] we have an ordering [C, D#, B] that gives 3 and 7, so it fails. \n\n        However, wait: the condition for minor requires the two consecutive intervals to be 3 and 4. In [B, C, D#], we did not find an ordering that satisfies either (4 and 3) or (3 and 4). \n\n        Therefore, [B, C, D#] is \"strange\".\n\n        But wait, the example input includes ['A B H'] and outputs 'strange'. So we are consistent.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n        Steps:\n          - Map the input string (split into three tokens) to their corresponding numbers.\n\n          - Create a list of the three numbers.\n\n          - Generate all permutations of these three numbers (there are 6).\n\n          - For each permutation (a, b, c):\n                Check if ( (b - a) % 12 == 4 and (c - b) % 12 == 3 ) -> then major found.\n                Check if ( (b - a) % 12 == 3 and (c - b) % 12 == 4 ) -> then minor found.\n\n          - If we find a major in any permutation, output \"major\".\n          - Else if we find a minor in any permutation, output \"minor\".\n          - Otherwise, output \"strange\".\n\n        However, note: the modulus operation: \n            We want the distance from a to b to be the smallest positive distance? Actually, the problem says the distance is from the lowest to the uppest. But in a circle, we have two ways to go from a to b: the short way and the long way. However, the problem specifies that we are taking the distance from the lowest tone to the uppest one. \n\n        But note: the chord definition requires consecutive notes. In a chord, the intervals are measured as the smallest positive distance? Not necessarily: the example \"E to C\" is 8, which is the long way. \n\n        However, the problem states: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\", meaning that they are considering the upward direction even if it goes over the octave. \n\n        So the modulus operation we are using (computing (b - a) % 12) gives the minimal non-negative residue, but note: \n            If a=10 (B) and b=0 (C): \n                (0 - 10) % 12 = (-10) % 12 = 2. But the problem says the distance from B to C is 2 semitones? Actually, from B to C: \n                    B, then C (next note) -> that's one semitone? Actually, no: the note after B is C, so the distance from B to C is 1 semitone? \n\n        Wait, let me check the mapping:\n\n            C:0, C#:1, D:2, D#:3, E:4, F:5, F#:6, G:7, G#:8, A:9, B:10, H:11.\n\n        Correction: the problem says the 12 notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n        So H is the last one, which is 11. Then the next note after H is C (0). \n\n        So the distance from B (10) to C (0) is (0 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 2, but wait: the actual steps from B to C: \n            B, then C -> one step. But according to our mapping, the step from B (10) to C (0) is one semitone, but our modulus gives 2? \n\n        Let me recalc: \n            The distance from a to b (in the circle) is defined as (b - a) mod 12, but if we are going from a to b in the positive direction (which is the same as adding semitones) then we can define the distance as (b - a) mod 12, but if negative we add 12 until positive? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone\", so the distance from B to C is 1. \n\n        Our mapping: \n            B is 10, C is 0. The distance from B to C is (0 - 10) mod 12 = 2, but that is not 1.\n\n        We must define the distance from a to b as (b - a) mod 12, but if the result is negative, we add 12. However, the modulus operator in Python for negative numbers: \n            (0 - 10) % 12 -> 2, which is not the direct consecutive step.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define the distance from a to b as (b - a) if b>=a, otherwise (b - a + 12). \n\n        Example: \n            a=10 (B), b=0 (C): then since 0 < 10, we do (0 - 10 + 12) = 2. But the consecutive distance from B to C is 1.\n\n        Why is that? \n\n        The issue is that the circle has 12 notes. The distance from a to b in the circle is the minimal positive steps? But the problem says the distance from E to C is 8, which is the long way, not the minimal.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning that we are always moving in the positive direction (clockwise) and if we pass the octave, we continue. \n\n        So the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod 12, but if we are going from a to b and we are allowed to go beyond the octave, then the distance is the smallest non-negative value that is the difference in the circular scale. However, the example E to C is 8, which is the long way (because the short way from E to C is 4 semitones downward? but the problem says upward). \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"the distance between E and C is 8 semitones\" (meaning upward from E to C: E->F->F#->G->G#->A->B->H->C: that's 8 steps). \n\n        Therefore, the distance from a to b is defined as (b - a) mod 12, but if negative we add 12, so that we get the upward distance (which might be more than 6). \n\n        But wait: the problem says \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone\", meaning that the minimal distance between two adjacent notes is 1, but the distance from E to C is 8 because we are going through 8 consecutive steps (each step being a semitone) from E to C.\n\n        Therefore, the distance from a to b is (b - a) % 12, but if the result is negative, we add 12 until positive. This is equivalent to (b - a) % 12, but note: in modular arithmetic, (b - a) % 12 is computed as (b - a + 12) % 12 if (b - a) is negative.\n\n        However, the example E to C: \n            E is 4, C is 0 -> (0-4) % 12 = -4 %12 = 8 (because -4 + 12 = 8). So that matches.\n\n        And the example B to C: \n            B is 10, C is 0 -> (0-10) %12 = -10 %12 = 2. But the consecutive distance from B to C should be 1? \n\n        Wait, let me count the semitones from B to C: \n            B, then C -> that's one semitone. But in our mapping, the note after B is C, so the distance is 1. \n\n        How do we map the semitones? \n\n        The problem says: \n            C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n        So the sequence is:\n            C (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11)\n\n        Then the next note after B (10) is H (11) and then C (0). \n\n        Wait, the problem says: \"after H goes C again, and before C stands H\". So the order is cyclic: ... , H, C, C#, ... \n\n        But then the note after B is not C, but H? \n\n        Actually, the problem says the 12 notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\n        And then: \"We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other.\"\n\n        So the sequence is: \n            ... , H, C, C#, D, ...\n\n        Therefore, the note after H is C, and the note before C is H. \n\n        But then, what is the note after B? The list goes: A, B, H. So after B comes H, then C.\n\n        So the distance from B to C is not 1, but 2: \n            B -> H (1 semitone), H -> C (another semitone) -> total 2.\n\n        And from B to H: 1 semitone.\n\n        Then our mapping is correct: \n            B (10) to H (11): (11-10)=1 -> 1 semitone.\n            B (10) to C (0): (0-10+12)%12 = 2 -> 2 semitones.\n\n        So the example input \"C# B F\" is minor: \n            Notes: C# (1), B (10), F (5)\n\n        They say: order as \"B C# F\": \n            B to C#: (1 - 10 + 12) %12 = 3 -> 3 semitones.\n            C# to F: (5 - 1) %12 = 4 -> 4 semitones.\n\n        That matches.\n\n        Therefore, the mapping is correct.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n        1. Create a dictionary for the note to number mapping:\n\n            note_to_num = {\n                'C': 0,\n                'C#': 1, 'Db': 1,   # but the problem uses '#' and doesn't mention flats, but the example uses only sharps. The input will use the given notation: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n                'D': 2,\n                'D#': 3, 'Eb': 3,    # but the problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So we don't have flats, but the input might use both? The problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input format: space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n            However, the example input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'].\n\n            The problem says: \"There are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\".\n\n            So we don't need to consider flats? The input will only contain the given names.\n\n            But wait: the example input uses only the given names. \n\n            So we can map:\n\n            mapping = {\n                'C': 0,\n                'C#': 1,\n                'D': 2,\n                'D#': 3,\n                'E': 4,\n                'F': 5,\n                'F#': 6,\n                'G': 7,\n                'G#': 8,\n                'A': 9,\n                'B': 10,\n                'H': 11\n            }\n\n        2. Read the input string, split it, and map each note to its number.\n\n        3. Generate all permutations of the three numbers.\n\n        4. For each permutation (a, b, c):\n\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n\n            But wait, the condition requires the entire set to be considered in a linear fashion? Actually, the condition is defined for consecutive notes in the chosen ordering. \n\n            However, note: the condition for major is that the first interval is 4 and the second is 3. But the entire chord must have three notes, and the intervals are defined in the circle? \n\n            Actually, the condition does not require the entire chord to be within one octave? \n\n            But the example \"C E G\": \n                C=0, E=4, G=7: \n                d1 = (4-0)%12=4, d2=(7-4)%12=3 -> major.\n\n            Example \"C# B F\": \n                [10, 1, 5] (if we take the permutation [10,1,5]): \n                d1 = (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12=3, d2=(5-1)%12=4 -> minor.\n\n            But what if the chord wraps around? \n\n            Example: [11, 0, 3] (H, C, D#): \n                Permutation [0,3,11]:\n                    d1 = (3-0)%12=3, d2=(11-3)%12=8 -> not matching.\n\n                Permutation [0,11,3]:\n                    d1 = (11-0)%12=11, d2=(3-11)%12= (3-11+12)%12=4 -> not 3 or 4 for the first condition.\n\n                Permutation [3,0,11]:\n                    d1 = (0-3)%12=9, d2=(11-0)%12=11 -> no.\n\n                Permutation [3,11,0]:\n                    d1 = (11-3)%12=8, d2=(0-11)%12=1 -> no.\n\n                Permutation [11,3,0]:\n                    d1 = (3-11)%12= (3-11+12)%12=4, d2=(0-3)%12=9 -> no.\n\n                Permutation [11,0,3]:\n                    d1 = (0-11)%12=1, d2=(3-0)%12=3 -> no.\n\n            So [H, C, D#] is strange.\n\n        5. However, note: the condition requires the entire set to be consecutive in the circle? Actually, the condition is defined by the two consecutive intervals. \n\n        But wait, the problem does not say that the three notes must be consecutive in the circle. They can be anywhere. \n\n        The condition is: there exists an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 (for major) and from Y to Z is 3. \n\n        In the circle, the distance from X to Y is the upward distance (mod 12) and similarly for Y to Z.\n\n        But note: the entire chord might be broken into two parts: from X to Y (4 semitones) and then from Y to Z (3 semitones) and then from Z to X (which is 7 semitones, but we don't care). \n\n        However, the chord must be contained in a 12-semitone circle, and the condition is local.\n\n        Therefore, we check every permutation.\n\n        Code:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        mapping = {'C':0, 'C#':1, 'D':2, 'D#':3, 'E':4, 'F':5, 'F#':6, 'G':7, 'G#':8, 'A':9, 'B':10, 'H':11}\n\n        notes = input().split()\n        nums = [mapping[note] for note in notes]\n\n        from itertools import permutations\n        found_major = False\n        found_minor = False\n\n        for perm in permutations(nums):\n            a, b, c = perm\n            # Calculate the two consecutive distances\n            d1 = (b - a) % 12\n            d2 = (c - b) % 12\n\n            # But wait: the condition requires the entire set to be considered as three consecutive notes? \n            # Actually, the chord is defined by the two consecutive intervals. However, note: the set of three notes must be the same as {a,b,c}. \n\n            # However, we have to check the entire set? The condition does not require that the third interval (from a to c) is 7, but the two consecutive intervals are 4 and 3 (or 3 and 4). \n\n            # But note: the problem does not require the entire chord to be contained in one octave? Actually, the chord is defined by the two consecutive intervals, and the third interval (from a to c) is d1+d2, which must be 7 for major and 7 for minor? \n\n            # However, the condition does not explicitly say that. It only says the two consecutive intervals. \n\n            # But the example: \"C E G\": \n            #   d1 = 4, d2 = 3 -> then the entire chord from C to G is 7, which is the perfect fifth.\n\n            # In the circle, the chord must be contained within 12 semitones? \n\n            # Actually, the condition does not require that the entire chord is contained in one octave. However, the two consecutive intervals must be 4 and 3 (for major) and then the third interval (from a to c) is 7, which is less than 12.\n\n            # But if the chord wraps around, then the two consecutive intervals might be defined by the upward path that goes over the octave. \n\n            # However, our modulus operation already accounts for the circularity.\n\n            # But note: the condition does not say that the three notes are distinct. The problem says a chord is an unordered set of three notes. So we assume distinct.\n\n            # Check for major: d1==4 and d2==3\n            if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                found_major = True\n            elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n                found_minor = True\n\n        However, wait: in the example \"C# B F\", we have the permutation [10,1,5] (B, C#, F) -> \n            a=10, b=1, c=5\n            d1 = (1-10)%12 = (1-10+12)%12 = 3\n            d2 = (5-1)%12 = 4 -> minor.\n\n        But what if the chord is defined by an ordering that does not use the entire set of three notes in a contiguous block? \n\n        Actually, the permutation generates all orders. But note: the condition requires that the three notes are consecutive in the ordering. \n\n        However, the chord is defined by the set of three notes, and we are allowed to choose any ordering. \n\n        But wait: what if we have a chord that is major in one ordering and minor in another? The problem states: \"Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous\", meaning that a chord cannot be both major and minor.\n\n        Therefore, we break once we find one.\n\n        However, we are iterating over all permutations. We can break early if we found one.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break out of the loop as soon as we find a major or minor.\n\n        But note: we must check all permutations because one permutation might be major and another minor? But the problem says it's unambiguous.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously\", so we can break as soon as we find one.\n\n        But wait: we are generating all permutations and checking independently. We can break early if we found a major or minor.\n\n        However, we are checking for major and minor separately.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            for perm in permutations(nums):\n                a, b, c = perm\n                d1 = (b - a) % 12\n                d2 = (c - b) % 12\n                if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n                    print(\"major\")\n                    exit(0)  ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all possible orderings of the three notes to see if they meet the specific interval conditions for either a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a corresponding number (0 to 11) based on its position in the chromatic scale starting from C (0).\n2. **Generating Permutations**: All possible permutations of the three input notes are generated to explore every possible ordering.\n3. **Checking Intervals**: For each permutation, the intervals between consecutive notes are calculated. A major chord requires the first interval to be 4 semitones and the second interval to be 3 semitones. A minor chord requires the first interval to be 3 semitones and the second interval to be 4 semitones.\n4. **Early Termination**: If any permutation satisfies the conditions for a major or minor chord, the result is immediately determined and printed. If no such permutation is found after checking all possibilities, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    mapping = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    \n    data = input().split()\n    nums = [mapping[note] for note in data]\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(nums):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d1 = (b - a) % 12\n        d2 = (c - b) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n            \n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `mapping` dictionary converts each note to its corresponding semitone value (e.g., 'C' maps to 0, 'C#' to 1, etc.).\n2. **Input Handling**: The input string is split into individual notes, which are then converted to their respective numerical values using the `mapping` dictionary.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The code generates all permutations of the three numerical values. For each permutation, it calculates the intervals between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Chord Classification**: The intervals are checked against the conditions for a major (4 and 3 semitones) or minor (3 and 4 semitones) chord. If a match is found, the corresponding result is printed immediately. If no match is found after all permutations are checked, the output is \"strange\".\n5. **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the notes, ensuring accurate classification while leveraging early termination upon finding a valid chord configuration. This makes the solution both correct and optimal for the given problem constraints.",
