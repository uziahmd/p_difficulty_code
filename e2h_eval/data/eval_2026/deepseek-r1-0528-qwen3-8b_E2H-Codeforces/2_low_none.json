Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. All the letters on both diagonals must be the same.\n    - The main diagonal: from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1)\n    - The anti-diagonal: from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0)\n\n 2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter, and that letter must be different from the diagonal letter.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the diagonals must have the same letter, and the non-diagonals must have the same letter (which is different).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n.\n 2. Read the grid of n lines.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let d_char = the character that should be on the diagonals.\n\n But note: there might be two possibilities for the diagonals? Actually, the condition says both diagonals must have the same letter? \n Actually, the problem states: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\", but it doesn't explicitly say the two diagonals must be the same letter?\n However, looking at the example: \n   Example 1: Input \"5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\" -> Output \"NO\"\n   Why NO? Because in the center there is 's' (which is not the same as the diagonal letter 'x').\n\n But wait, in the example input 2: \n   \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\" -> Output \"YES\"\n\n In the second example, the diagonals are:\n   (0,0): 'w', (1,1): 's', (2,2): 'w' -> not all same? \n   Actually, wait: the example input is 3x3 with:\n        w s w\n        s w s\n        w s w\n\n But the condition says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". \n The main diagonal: ['w','w','w']? Actually, the main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) -> 'w','w','w'? \n But in the example, (1,1) is 'w'? No, the example has:\n        Line0: \"w s w\"\n        Line1: \"s w s\"\n        Line2: \"w s w\"\n\n So the main diagonal is [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[2][2]] -> ['w', 'w', 'w']? Actually, no: \n        grid[0][0] = 'w'\n        grid[1][1] = 'w' (from the second string, the middle character)\n        grid[2][2] = 'w'\n\n And the anti-diagonal: [grid[0][2], grid[1][1], grid[2][0]] -> ['w','w','w'].\n\n So the example does have the same letter on both diagonals (the letter 'w')?\n\n But wait, the example output is \"YES\", so that matches.\n\n However, in the third example:\n        \"3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe\"\n\n Main diagonal: [grid[0][0]='x', grid[1][1]='p', grid[2][2]='e'] -> not the same.\n\n So condition 1 fails.\n\n Therefore, we must check:\n   Condition 1: All the diagonal elements (both diagonals) must be the same letter. But note: what if the two diagonals have the same letter but not necessarily that every element on a diagonal is the same? Actually, the condition says \"all letters are the same\" on each diagonal.\n\n However, note: the two diagonals must have the same letter? Or just that each diagonal has a single letter (but they could be different between the two diagonals)? \n\n Let me re-read: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". This means:\n   For the main diagonal: all the letters are the same (say letter A).\n   For the anti-diagonal: all the letters are the same (say letter B).\n\n But then the condition also says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\".\n\n Now, note: the letter for the non-diagonals must be the same and different from the diagonals. But the diagonals have two different letters? Then the non-diagonals must be a third letter? \n\n Example: \n   If the main diagonal has 'A' and the anti-diagonal has 'B', then the non-diagonals must be a letter C (different from both) and the same for all non-diagonals.\n\n However, the problem does not",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the integer `n` which specifies the size of the grid. Then, read the next `n` lines to get the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that all characters on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same. If they are not, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Characters**: Ensure that all characters not on either diagonal are the same and different from the diagonal characters. If any non-diagonal character violates this condition, the answer is \"NO\".\n4. **Output Result**: If all conditions are satisfied, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag_char1 = None\n    diag_char2 = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = grid[i]\n        if diag_char1 is None:\n            diag_char1 = row[i]\n        else:\n            if row[i] != diag_char1:\n                diag_char1 = None\n                break\n                \n    for i in range(n):\n        row = grid[i]\n        pos = n - 1 - i\n        if diag_char2 is None:\n            diag_char2 = row[pos]\n        else:\n            if row[pos] != diag_char2:\n                diag_char2 = None\n                break\n\n    if diag_char1 is None or diag_char2 is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    if diag_char1 != diag_char2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    main_diag_char = diag_char1\n    other_char = None\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if other_char is None:\n                other_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                if grid[i][j] != main_diag_char:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != other_char:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n\n    if valid and other_char != main_diag_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the grid size `n` and then reads each line of the grid into a list of strings.\n2. **Checking Diagonals**: The code checks if all elements on the main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where row index plus column index equals `n-1`) are the same. If either diagonal has differing characters, it prints \"NO\".\n3. **Checking Non-Diagonal Characters**: The code ensures all non-diagonal characters are identical and different from the diagonal characters. If any non-diagonal character does not meet these conditions, it prints \"NO\".\n4. **Final Validation**: After verifying both diagonals and non-diagonal characters, the code checks if the non-diagonal character is indeed different from the diagonal character. If all conditions are met, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions to determine if the grid forms an \"X\" as specified, ensuring correctness with minimal computational overhead.",
