The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is of size w x h (rows x columns).\n We are to add k gilded rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is the outer border). \n Each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge, and has a width of 1 cell.\n\n The i-th ring (with i starting at 1) is drawn on the inner rectangle of size:\n   (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))\n\n However, note that the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle. The number of cells in the border of an a x b rectangle is:\n   If a >= 3 and b >= 3: then the border (the outer ring) has 2*a + 2*b - 4 (because the four corners are counted twice).\n\n But note: the problem states that the first ring is the entire outer edge of the original plate, so for the first ring we have an outer rectangle of w x h.\n\n However, there's a catch: the rings are drawn inwards. The second ring is drawn on a rectangle that is 2 cells in from each edge, so the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4). But note: the second ring is the border of that (w-4) x (h-4) rectangle.\n\n Important: The condition for k is that k must be at most floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). This means that we won't have a negative dimension.\n\n How to compute the number of cells for the i-th ring?\n   Let the current rectangle for the i-th ring be: \n        a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   Then the number of cells in the ring is: 2 * a_i + 2 * b_i - 4, but wait: this formula counts the entire border of a rectangle of size a_i x b_i.\n\n However, note that the example:\n\n Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> output 8.\n   For i=1: a1 = 3, b1=3 -> 2*3+2*3-4 = 6+6-4 = 8. Correct.\n\n Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> output 28.\n   For i=1: a1=7, b1=9 -> 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4 = 28. Correct.\n\n Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> output 40.\n   First ring: 28.\n   Second ring: i=2 -> a2 = 7 - 4*(2-1)=3, b2=9-4*(2-1)=5 -> 2*3+2*5-4 = 6+10-4=12.\n   Total = 28+12=40. Correct.\n\n Therefore, the total number of gilded cells is the sum for i=1 to k of [2*(w-4*(i-1)) + 2*(h-4*(i-1)) - 4]\n\n But wait: the problem says that the rings are drawn inwards and the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, meaning we subtract 4 from both dimensions for each ring? Actually, for the second ring we subtract 4*(2-1)=4 from both.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\".\n\n So the formula for the i-th ring is: \n   ring_i = 2*(w - 4*(i-1)) + 2*(h - 4*(i-1)) - 4\n\n But note: we must check that the rectangle for the i-th ring has non-negative dimensions and at least 3x3? Actually, the problem states that k is chosen such that the inner rectangle exists (we subtract 4*(k-1) and then we require that the minimum dimension is positive and at least 3? Actually, the condition is that k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n However, let me verify: \n   Condition: k <= floor((min(n, m)+1)/4)\n\n   Example: w=7, h=9 -> min=7 -> (7+1)/4 = 8/4=2 -> so k can be 1 or 2.\n\n   For k=2: we use two rings. The second ring uses a rectangle of (7-4)=3 and (",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is positioned 2 cells away from the previous one, moving inward. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle. The dimensions of the rectangle for the i-th ring are derived by subtracting \\(4 \\times (i-1)\\) from both the original width and height. The number of cells in each ring is calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, adjusted for overlapping corners: \\(2 \\times (a + b) - 4\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the dimensions of the current rectangle.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle, then apply the perimeter formula to find the number of cells in that ring. Sum these values across all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each ring exactly once, leading to a time complexity of \\(O(k)\\), which is efficient given the constraints \\(k \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(w, h) + 1}{4} \\right\\rfloor\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        a = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n        b = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n            break\n        ring_cells = 2 * a + 2 * b - 4\n        total_cells += ring_cells\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: the plate dimensions (w, h) and the number of rings (k).\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize `total_cells` to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - Calculate the dimensions of the current inner rectangle by subtracting \\(4 \\times (i-1)\\) from both the original width and height.\n   - If either dimension becomes non-positive, break the loop as further rings would not be valid.\n   - Compute the number of cells in the current ring using the formula \\(2 \\times (a + b) - 4\\), which accounts for the perimeter of the rectangle while adjusting for corner overlaps.\n   - Add the computed cells to `total_cells`.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all valid rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.",
