Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to process the queries in reverse order because each query replaces a digit with a string, and subsequent queries might use digits that are produced by previous replacements.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the queries are performed in the given order. But if we do them in forward order, then a replacement in an earlier query might be overwritten by a later one? Actually, no: the later queries will also consider the entire current string (with the previous replacements). But note: the replacement is for the digit `di` (which is a digit, not a character). So, for example, if we first replace '2' with '00', then later we replace '0' with something, then the zeros that were introduced by replacing '2' will be replaced as well.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"replace all digits di in string s\", so the replacements are done on the entire string at that moment. And then the next query uses the updated string.\n\n However, if we do the queries in reverse order, we can use dynamic programming or a transformation that builds from the last query to the first.\n\n Insight: Instead of doing the replacements one by one (which would be too slow because each replacement could be long and we have up to 10^5 queries and total length of ti's is 10^5, but the initial string is 10^5 and after replacements the string could become very long), we need to avoid building the entire string.\n\n Alternative approach: We can represent the transformation of the entire string by considering that each digit in the original string is transformed through a series of replacements. But note: the queries are sequential and each replacement applies to every occurrence of the digit at the time of the query.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say that the total length of all ti strings is <= 10^5. But the number of queries is up to 10^5, and the initial string is up to 10^5. If we do the replacements naively (by scanning the whole string for each query) the complexity is O(n * |s|) which is too high.\n\n Another idea: We can use a system of transformations for each digit. Since there are only 10 digits (from '0' to '9'), we can precompute for each digit what it becomes after processing all the queries? But note: the queries are applied in order, and each query replaces a specific digit. Also, the replacement string may contain digits that are subject to later queries.\n\n However, observe: the last query might change the meaning of the digits that were introduced by earlier queries. But actually, the queries are independent in the sense that each query specifies a digit to replace. But if a query replaces digit 'd' with a string containing another digit 'e', then in the next query, if we replace 'e' with something else, then the 'e' that came from the first replacement should be replaced as well.\n\n Therefore, we must process the queries from last to first, and update the meaning of each digit.\n\n Let's define an array `mapping` for digits '0' to '9'. Initially, each digit maps to itself.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to output the string, but the number modulo 10^9+7. We cannot build the huge string.\n\n Instead, we can compute the value of the entire string by processing the string from left to right, but we need to know the effect of all queries on each digit.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Process the queries in reverse order (from last to first). For each query (d -> t), we update the mapping for the digit d: originally, the digit d was going to be replaced by t, but then after that, there might be further queries that replace digits in t. However, we have already processed the later queries (so we know the final outcome of replacing each digit in t). Therefore, we can set the new mapping for d as the result of replacing every digit in t by its mapping (from the reverse processing).\n\n 2. However, we also need to account for the fact that the replacement string t might be built from multiple digits, and each digit in t has been transformed by the subsequent queries. But note: we are processing in reverse, so the mapping we have now for each digit is the result after processing all the queries that come after the current one.\n\n 3. After we have built the mapping for each digit (i.e., what each digit becomes after all the queries), then we can process the initial string s: for each digit c in s, we replace c by mapping[c], and then we form the entire string (but without building it explicitly, we can compute the number modulo 10^9+7).\n\n However, wait: the replacement is done sequentially, and the same digit might appear multiple times and be replaced multiple times? Actually, no: each query replaces a particular digit (so we are replacing all occurrences of that digit at the time of the query). But if we are building the mapping for each digit, then the mapping for a digit d is the string that d is expanded to after all the queries (including the ones that occur after d's replacement).\n\n But note: the queries are applied in order, and the replacement of a digit d in an earlier query is then subject to the subsequent queries. Therefore, the mapping for d must consider that the replacement string t for d (in an earlier query) is itself processed by the subsequent queries (which we have stored as mappings for each digit). So we can do:\n\n   Let `f` be a function (or an array) that maps each digit to a string (or perhaps we break down the string into a value and a length?).\n\n However, the problem: the entire string is built by concatenating the expansion of each digit. But the expansion of a digit is a string of digits, and when we form the number, the value of the entire string is:\n\n   Let F(s) be the number represented by the string s (ignoring leading zeros, but note: the string might start with zeros? Actually, the problem says to ignore leading zeros when forming the number, but note the example: \n        Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\" -> Output: '777'\n        But wait, the sample input: \n            Input: \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\" \n            First query: replace '2' by '00' -> \"0000\"\n            Then second query: replace '0' by '7' -> \"7777\", but the sample output is '777'? \n\n        Actually, the sample input provided in the example is: \n            ['222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n        And the output for the third sample is '777'. \n\n        Let me check: \n          The third sample input is: \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\", then the output is '777'.\n\n        But note: the example says:\n            Input: \n                222\n                2\n                2->00\n                0->7\n\n            Output: 777\n\n        However, the problem states: \n            \"After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007\"\n\n        The example: \n            Initially: \"222\"\n            Query1: replace '2' by '00' -> \"0000\"\n            Query2: replace '0' by '7' -> \"7777\"\n\n        But the expected output is 777, not 7777.\n\n        Wait, the example output is printed as '777', meaning the number 777. \n\n        There must be an error in my reasoning or the example.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n            Example: \"if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212.\"\n\n        So the transformation is done step by step. \n\n        Now, the third sample: \n            \"222\", then two queries: \n                First: \"2->00\": so the string becomes \"0000\"\n                Second: \"0->7\": so the string becomes \"7777\"\n\n        But the example output is '777'. \n\n        This is a discrepancy.\n\n        Looking at the sample input provided in the example: \n            ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n        The fourth sample: \n            Input: \"1000000008\\n0\" -> output: 1\n\n        So the fourth sample: no queries, so the string is \"1000000008\", and we take modulo 10^9+7: \n            1000000008 mod 1000000007 = 1.\n\n        The third sample output is written as '777', but according to our calculation it should be 7777. \n\n        However, the example output list says: \n            ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n        So the third sample output is 777, not 7777.\n\n        Let me reexamine the sample:\n\n            Query1: replace '2' by '00' in \"222\": \n                Original: \"222\" -> becomes \"0000\"\n\n            Query2: replace '0' by '7' in \"0000\":\n                Then we replace every '0' by '7', so we get \"7777\"\n\n            Then the number is 7777, and 7777 mod 1000000007 is 7777, but the example output is 777.\n\n        There seems to be a mistake in the example.\n\n        But wait, the problem statement says:\n\n            \"For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212.\"\n\n        In this example, they did two queries and the resulting string is 1212, which is the number 1212.\n\n        However, in the third sample, the example output is 777. \n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the queries are applied only once per digit? Or maybe the example intended to have two queries but the second query is applied only to the original digits? \n\n        Let me read the problem statement again: \"Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries ... that means 'replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti'\".\n\n        The key word is \"all\", and the replacement is done on the entire current string.\n\n        So the second query should replace every occurrence of '0' (which was introduced by the first query) with '7'. \n\n        Therefore, the result is 7777.\n\n        However, the sample output provided in the example is 777. \n\n        This suggests that the sample input and output might have been miswritten.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \n            Input: \n                222\n                2\n                2->00\n                0->7\n\n            Expected Output: 777\n\n        This does not match.\n\n        After checking the sample outputs in the example:\n\n            Sample 1: Input \"123123\\n1\\n2->00\" -> Output \"10031003\"\n            Sample 2: Input \"123123\\n1\\n3->\" -> Output \"1212\"\n            Sample 3: Input \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\" -> Output \"777\"\n            Sample 4: Input \"1000000008\\n0\" -> Output \"1\"\n\n        The fourth sample is clear.\n\n        The first two samples: \n            Sample1: \n                s = \"123123\"\n                Query: \"2->00\" -> becomes \"10031003\" -> correct.\n            Sample2:\n                s = \"123123\"\n                Query: \"3->\" (empty string) -> becomes \"1212\" -> correct.\n\n        Now, sample3: \n            s = \"222\", two queries: \n                Query1: \"2->00\" -> becomes \"0000\"\n                Query2: \"0->7\" -> becomes \"7777\"\n\n            Then the number is 7777, and 7777 mod 1000000007 is 7777.\n\n        But the expected output is 777.\n\n        I suspect there is a misunderstanding: the problem says \"the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007\". \n\n        The example outputs are printed as the string representation? But the problem says to output the integer remainder.\n\n        However, the sample outputs are shown as strings. But the problem says: Print a single integer.\n\n        The example outputs are:\n\n            ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n        These are integers? Actually, the first two are strings that are the decimal representation, but the third and fourth are integers?\n\n        But wait, the fourth sample input is \"1000000008\\n0\", and the output is 1, which is the integer.\n\n        The third sample output is 777, which is an integer.\n\n        But our program must output an integer (the remainder). \n\n        The example input \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\" results in the string \"7777\", and then we compute 7777 % 1000000007 = 7777. \n\n        Why is the example output 777?\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the problem intended the third sample to be:\n\n            \"222\", then two queries: \n                \"2->00\"\n                \"0->0\" (meaning nothing? but wait, the example writes \"0->7\")\n\n        Or perhaps the problem has a different interpretation: maybe the replacement is done only once for the initial digits and the subsequent digits are not considered? \n\n        But the problem says \"replace all digits di in string s\" (at the time of the query). \n\n        There is another possibility: the problem does not consider that the replacement in the second query affects the entire string (including the zeros that were inserted by the first query). But the problem statement says \"replace all digits di\", so it should.\n\n        After re‐reading the problem statement: \"Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries ... that means 'replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti'\".\n\n        The word \"all\" means every occurrence.\n\n        Therefore, the example should output 7777, but the example says 777.\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        However, looking at the sample outputs provided in the example, the third sample output is written as 777. \n\n        Let me check the official sample test cases (if available) or think of an alternative explanation.\n\n        Alternative interpretation: the queries are applied from left to right, but each replacement is done on the entire string at the time, and the next query uses the entire updated string.\n\n        But that is what we did.\n\n        Another possibility: the problem expects that the replacement in the second query is applied only to the zeros that were originally present? No, the problem does not specify that.\n\n        Or maybe the example meant to write the third sample as:\n\n            Input: \n                \"222\"\n                1\n                2->00\n\n            and then the second query is not part of the third sample? But the sample input is given as:\n\n                \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\"\n\n        There is a known issue: the sample output in the problem statement might be incorrect.\n\n        But wait, the problem statement says:\n\n            Input: \n                The first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.\n                The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.\n                The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries.\n\n            Output: \n                Print a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (10^9+7).\n\n        So the output is an integer. \n\n        The example outputs shown are strings? Actually, the example output for the first sample is \"10031003\", which is a string, but the problem says to output an integer. \n\n        There is a mix-up in the example.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: the output is the remainder, so we output an integer.\n\n        But the example input and output are provided as:\n\n            Input: ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n            Output: ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n        This suggests that the example output for the first two samples are the transformed strings, and for the last two are the remainders.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Print a single integer\".\n\n        Now I see: the problem statement example output is not matching the actual requirement. \n\n        Clarification from the problem: \n            For the first sample: \n                Input: \"123123\", then one query \"2->00\", so the resulting string is \"10031003\", and then the number is 10031003. Then we output 10031003 % 1000000007 = 10031003 (since 10031003 < 1000000007).\n\n            For the second sample: \n                Input: \"123123\", then one query \"3->\", so the resulting string is \"1212\", and then the number is 1212.\n\n            For the third sample: \n                Input: \"222\", then two queries: \"2->00\" and \"0->7\", so the resulting string is \"7777\", and 7777 % 1000000007 = 7777.\n\n            For the fourth sample: \n                Input: \"1000000008\", no queries, so the number is 1000000008, and 1000000008 % 1000000007 = 1.\n\n        But the example output for the third sample is 777, not 7777.\n\n        Unless the problem intended the third sample to have a different set of queries? \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have intended to remove the leading zeros? \n\n        But note: the problem says: \"ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\n        However, the transformation \"2->00\" in the third sample produces a string that starts with zeros. But then the next query replaces zeros by sevens, so the zeros become sevens. \n\n        The string \"7777\" does not have leading zeros.\n\n        Another possibility: the example output for the third sample is a typo and should be 7777.\n\n        But the problem says: \"the remainder after division\", so 7777 is the correct answer.\n\n        However, the sample output provided in the problem statement for the third sample is 777.\n\n        There is a disconnect.\n\n        Let me look at the provided example outputs again:\n\n            Input: \n                ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n            Output: \n                ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n        The first two outputs are the transformed strings (as described) and the last two are the remainders.\n\n        This is inconsistent.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Print a single integer\".\n\n        Therefore, the example output for the first two samples must be the remainders (integers) and not the string representations.\n\n        Let me calculate:\n\n            First sample: \n                String: \"10031003\"\n                Number: 10031003\n                Remainder: 10031003 % 1000000007 = 10031003\n\n            Second sample:\n                String: \"1212\"\n                Number: 1212\n                Remainder: 1212\n\n            Third sample:\n                String: \"7777\"\n                Number: 7777\n                Remainder: 7777\n\n            Fourth sample:\n                String: \"1000000008\"\n                Remainder: 1\n\n        But the example output for the first sample is 10031003 (which is the integer) and for the second sample 1212 (the integer). For the third sample, 7777 (the integer) and fourth 1.\n\n        However, the example output is written as:\n\n            ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n        This matches the integer remainders except for the third sample: 7777 vs 777.\n\n        So unless the problem intended the third sample to be:\n\n            \"222\", then two queries: \n                \"2->00\"\n                \"0->7\" but applied only to the zeros that were not introduced by a replacement? \n\n        Or perhaps the problem has a different transformation rule: the replacement is done only on the digits that are originally in the string (the initial digits) and not on the newly introduced ones? \n\n        But the problem says: \"replace all digits di in string s\" (at the time of the query). \n\n        The second query is applied to the entire string at that time, which includes the zeros from the first replacement.\n\n        Therefore, I conclude that the example output for the third sample is incorrect.\n\n        But wait, the sample input for the third sample is:\n\n            \"222\\n2\\n2->00\\n0->7\"\n\n        The expected output is 777.\n\n        How can we get 777?\n\n        If we interpret the queries differently: maybe the second query \"0->7\" is applied only to the original zeros (if any) and not to the zeros that were inserted by the first query? \n\n        The problem does not say that. It says \"replace all digits di in string s\", meaning the entire current string.\n\n        However, let's try to break down the third sample:\n\n            Start: \"222\"\n            Query1: Replace all '2' with \"00\": \n                So we break \"222\" into three '2's, and each becomes \"00\", so we get \"0000\".\n            Query2: Replace all '0' with \"7\": \n                Break \"0000\" into four '0's, each becomes \"7\", so we get \"7777\".\n\n        So the result is \"7777\", which is the number 7777.\n\n        But 7777 mod 1000000007 is 7777.\n\n        Unless the problem is asking for the number represented by the string, but then removing any leading zeros? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"ignore the leading zeroes\", but then if we have a string that becomes \"0000\", that is not allowed? Actually, the problem says: \"when you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes\".\n\n        But note: the transformation produces a string that may have leading zeros, but then the number is formed by ignoring those leading zeros? \n\n        However, the example: \n            Query1: \"2->00\" in \"222\" -> \"0000\", then ignoring leading zeros: that would be \"0\", but then the second query replaces zeros with sevens? \n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"ignore the leading zeroes\" when forming the number. \n\n        So if the entire string becomes \"0000\", then the number is 0.\n\n        Then after the second query: \n            We have \"0000\" -> but we are about to do the second query on the entire string \"0000\", but note: the second query replaces '0' by '7'. \n\n        But if we ignore leading zeros at the end, then we must consider the entire string as a decimal number. \n\n        The standard way to form a number from a string is to drop leading zeros, but the entire string is the decimal representation. \n\n        However, the problem does not say to drop leading zeros during intermediate steps. It says: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes\".\n\n        This means that at the end, we drop the leading zeros. \n\n        But note: the example \"123123\" becomes \"10031003\" after the first query. Then we form the number 10031003, which has no leading zeros.\n\n        The example \"123123\" becomes \"1212\" after the second query, and 1212 has no leading zeros.\n\n        The third sample: the final string is \"7777\", which has no leading zeros.\n\n        But what if the final string is \"0000\"? Then the number is 0.\n\n        However, the third sample's final string is \"7777\", so no issue.\n\n        Now, consider if the final string is \"0000\", then the number is 0.\n\n        But the third sample does not produce \"0000\", it produces \"7777\".\n\n        So how can the third sample yield 777?\n\n        Unless the problem meant to apply the queries in a different order, or the transformation is defined differently.\n\n        After reading the problem statement again: the queries are performed in the given order, and each query replaces ALL occurrences of the digit di in the current string.\n\n        There is no mention of dropping leading zeros during the transformation, only at the end.\n\n        So I think the example output for the third sample is indeed 7777.\n\n        But the problem statement example output says 777.\n\n        This is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n        However, let us check the sample inputs and outputs from the problem statement:\n\n            Sample 1: \n                Input: \"123123\", query \"2->00\" -> Output: 10031003 (which is the integer, and 10031003 % 1000000007 = 10031003)\n\n            Sample 2:\n                Input: \"123123\", query \"3->\" -> Output: 1212\n\n            Sample 3:\n                Input: \"222\", two queries: \"2->00\" and \"0->7\" -> Output: 7777\n\n            Sample 4:\n                Input: \"1000000008\", no queries -> Output: 1\n\n        But the problem statement example output is:\n\n            ['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n        This is inconsistent.\n\n        I suspect that the example output for sample 3 is a typo and should be 7777.\n\n        However, the problem statement says:\n\n            \"Print a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (10^9+7)\"\n\n        So we must output the integer remainder.\n\n        Given the confusion, let's assume the problem intended the following:\n\n            We have to process the queries in the given order, and the resulting string is then interpreted as a decimal number (ignoring any leading zeros at the very end) and then take modulo 1000000007.\n\n        But note: the string might be very long (up to 10^5 * (length of replacements) initially, but we cannot build the string.\n\n        Alternative approach: \n\n        We can use dynamic programming for each digit (0-9) to represent what that digit expands to in terms of:\n\n            - The numeric value it contributes, modulo 1000000007.\n            - The length of the string it expands to.\n\n        However, the expansion is not just a numeric value but a string of digits, and the value depends on the position (because the value of a string is sum(d_i * 10^(len-1-i)).\n\n        But if we know the length of the expansion, then we can compute the value by breaking it down.\n\n        Let's define for each digit d (from '0' to '9') two things:\n\n            val[d] = the value (mod 1000000007) of the entire string that the digit d expands to, under the final mapping (after all queries).\n            len[d] = the total length of the string that the digit d expands to.\n\n        Then, for the entire string s, we can compute:\n\n            result = 0\n            power = 1\n            for each digit c in s (from left to right):\n                # But note: the expansion of c is a string, and we need to append it to the current result.\n\n                However, the expansion of c is a string of length L = len[c], and its value is val[c]. But the value val[c] is computed assuming that the expansion of c is at the current position.\n\n                Actually, if we have a current result, and we want to append a string T (which is the expansion of c) to the current result, then:\n\n                    new_result = (current_result * (10^(len(T))) + val[T]) % MOD\n\n                But we don't have T stored, but we have for each digit its expansion's value and length.\n\n                However, the expansion of a digit c is a string that is the concatenation of the expansions of each digit in the replacement string for c (from the final mapping). \n\n        But note: the mapping for each digit is fixed by the queries (processed in reverse order). However, we are processing the queries in reverse order to determine the final expansion for each digit.\n\n        Steps for the solution:\n\n        Step 1: Read the initial string s and the number of queries n.\n\n        Step 2: We'll create two arrays (or dictionaries) for the 10 digits:\n\n            Let `value` be an array of 10 integers (for digits '0' to '9'), initially `value[i] = i` (for digit i, which is the digit representing the integer i) and `length[i] = 1`.\n\n            But note: the initial mapping for a digit d is just the digit d, so the value is d (converted to int) and length is 1.\n\n        Step 3: Process the queries in reverse order (from last to first). For each query \"d->t\":\n\n            Let d_char be the digit (a char), and t the string.\n\n            We will update the mapping for the digit d_char.\n\n            However, the current mapping for each digit in t might have been updated by later queries (since we are processing in reverse). \n\n            The expansion of d_char is going to be the string t, but then each character in t is expanded by the current mappings (which include all the queries that come after the current one).\n\n            But note: the mapping for a digit is not changed by a previous query, but by the reverse processing.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Let d = int(d_char)  [But wait, we are working with characters? Actually, we have 10 digits: '0' to '9'.]\n\n                We are going to set:\n\n                    new_value = 0\n                    new_length = 0\n\n                But we cannot simply concatenate the values because the value of a string is not the sum of the values of its parts, but depends on the base (10).\n\n                However, if we know the expansion of each digit in t, then:\n\n                    The entire expansion for d_char is the concatenation of the expansions of each digit in t.\n\n                How to combine?\n\n                    Suppose t = t0 t1 ... tk-1 (each ti is a digit character)\n\n                    Then the expansion of d_char is: expand(t0) + expand(t1) + ... + expand(tk-1)\n\n                    The length is: L0 + L1 + ... + Lk-1, where Li = length[int(ti)]\n\n                    The value is: \n                        value = 0\n                        We traverse the expansion from left to right:\n\n                            value = (value * (10^(Li)) + val[ti]) % MOD\n\n                    But wait, we don't store the expansion as a string, but we can compute the value and the length for the entire t using the current mappings.\n\n                Alternatively, we can precompute for each digit its expansion (as a value and length) and then for a string t, we can do:\n\n                    value_t = 0\n                    len_t = 0\n                    for each char c in t:\n                        digit_index = ord(c) - ord('0')\n                        # The expansion for c is (value[digit_index], length[digit_index])\n                        # Then we append this expansion to value_t.\n\n                        value_t = (value_t * pow(10, length[digit_index], MOD) + value[digit_index]) % MOD\n                        len_t += length[digit_index]\n\n                Then we set:\n                    value[d_char] = value_t\n                    length[d_char] = len_t\n\n            However, note: the expansion of a digit might be very long, but the total length of all ti's is <= 10^5, and we are only storing 10 digits. But the length of the expansion might be huge? \n\n            But the problem: we are only interested in the value modulo 1000000007 and the length (which is used to shift the power) modulo something? \n\n            However, the length is used to compute the power: 10^(length) modulo MOD. But the length can be up to ... the total length of the expansion might be astronomical. But note: the total length of all ti's is <= 10^5, but the expansion is recursive.\n\n            But observe: the queries are up to 10^5, and the total length of the replacement strings is <= 10^5. However, the expansion can be exponential in the worst-case? \n\n            Example: \n                Query1: \"1->11\"\n                Query2: \"1->111\"\n\n                But we are processing in reverse order, so the last query is \"1->111\", then the first query is \"1->11\", but then we update the first query using the last query's mapping.\n\n            Actually, we are processing the queries from last to first, and updating the mapping for the digit in the query.\n\n            We must be cautious: the length of the expansion might be very large, but note that the length is used to compute the power (base 10) modulo 1000000007, but the exponent (the length) might be huge and we cannot compute 10^(length) directly if length is huge.\n\n            However, the problem says the total length of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. But note: the expansion is not limited by the initial 10^5 because the same digit might be expanded multiple times.\n\n            But we are only storing the expansion for the 10 digits. And the total length of the expansion for each digit might be huge, but we are not storing the entire string.\n\n            We are storing for each digit:\n\n                value[d] = the numeric value (mod 1000000007) of the expansion of d.\n                length[d] = the total number of digits in the expansion of d.\n\n            But the length[d] can be huge (exponentially large in the number of queries affecting that digit). \n\n            However, the modulus for the value is 1000000007, but for the length we only care about the exponentiation base 10. But the length is used as an",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of queries that transform a given string of digits by replacing all occurrences of a specific digit with another string of digits. The final transformed string is then interpreted as a decimal number, ignoring any leading zeros, and the result is taken modulo 1000000007.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing each query in the given order (which would be inefficient due to potential exponential growth in string length), we process them in reverse order. This allows us to determine the final transformation for each digit by considering all subsequent queries.\n2. **Dynamic Mapping for Digits**: For each digit (0-9), maintain two pieces of information:\n   - **Value**: The numeric value of the transformed string that the digit expands to, modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length**: The total number of digits in the transformed string that the digit expands to.\n3. **Updating Mappings**: For each query processed in reverse, update the mapping for the specified digit by combining the mappings of each digit in the replacement string. This involves calculating the new value and length by considering the contributions from each digit in the replacement string.\n4. **Final Calculation**: After processing all queries, compute the final numeric value of the initial string by expanding each digit according to its precomputed mapping and combining these values appropriately, taking modulo 1000000007 at each step to prevent overflow.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 1000000007\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n = int(data[1])\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        parts = data[i].split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d_char = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((d_char, t_str))\n    \n    value = [0] * 10\n    length_arr = [0] * 10\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        digit_char = str(i)\n        val_part = int(digit_char) % MOD\n        value[i] = val_part\n        length_arr[i] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n        d_char, t_str = queries[i]\n        if d_char not in '0123456789':\n            continue\n        d = int(d_char)\n        total_value = 0\n        total_length = 0\n        power_base = 1\n        \n        for char in t_str:\n            if char not in '0123456789':\n                continue\n            digit_index = int(char)\n            total_length += length_arr[digit_index]\n            total_value = (total_value * pow(10, length_arr[digit_index], MOD) + value[digit_index]) % MOD\n        \n        value[d] = total_value\n        length_arr[d] = total_length\n    \n    result = 0\n    current_length = 0\n    for char in s:\n        digit_index = int(char)\n        result = (result * pow(10, length_arr[digit_index], MOD) + value[digit_index]) % MOD\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the initial string and the list of queries.\n2. **Initialization**: Two arrays, `value` and `length_arr`, are initialized for each digit (0-9). Initially, each digit maps to itself, so its value is the digit itself and its length is 1.\n3. **Reverse Query Processing**: Each query is processed in reverse order. For each query, the specified digit's mapping is updated by combining the mappings of each digit in the replacement string. The new value is computed by treating the replacement string as a concatenation of the transformed strings of its digits, using modular arithmetic to keep numbers manageable.\n4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all queries, the initial string is transformed by replacing each digit with its final mapped value. The result is computed by iteratively combining these values, again using modular arithmetic to ensure results fit within standard integer limits.\n5. **Output**: The final result, which is the number formed by the transformed string modulo 1000000007, is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially exponential growth of the string by leveraging dynamic mappings and modular arithmetic, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
