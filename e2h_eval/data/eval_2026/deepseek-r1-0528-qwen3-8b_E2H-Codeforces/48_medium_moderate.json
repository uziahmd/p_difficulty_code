He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length up to 1000). However, note that if b is 'R', then the number is guaranteed to be at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given string `c` from base `a` to an integer (in base 10). But note: the string may contain digits beyond '9'. Since the base `a` is at most 25, the digits can be from '0' to 'Z' (but only up to 24, since base 25 requires 0-24). The problem says: \"In bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" So we have to map the string representation of digits to their numerical value.\n\n    However, note: the input string `c` is given in base `a`. The digits in base `a` can be represented by characters. For example, base 16 might have digits up to 'F'. But our base `a` is between 2 and 25, so the digits are from '0' to (base-1). The problem says the string has leading zeros allowed and length up to 1000.\n\n    How to convert?\n        We can treat each character in the string and map it to a digit value.\n\n    Example: \n        Input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base 10 to base 2, so the string \"1\" in base 10 is 1, then convert 1 to base 2 -> \"1\"\n\n        Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> base 16, the string \"5\" is 5 in base 16, then convert 5 to base R (Roman) -> \"V\"\n\n        Input: \"5 R\\n4\" -> base 5, the string \"4\" is 4 in base 5? Actually, wait: the problem says \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\". So if base a is 5, then the digits allowed are 0-4. But the example input is \"5 R\\n4\", meaning the number is 4 (in base 5) which is just 4 in decimal.\n\n    However, note: the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" is base 2, so the string \"1111001\" is 121 in decimal? Actually, let me compute: \n        1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 0*(2^1) + 1*(2^0) = 64+32+16+8+1 = 121. Then output is the same because base 2 remains 121 in base 2? Actually, no: wait, the output is '1111001' because we are converting from base 2 to base 2, so the same string.\n\n    But note: the problem says the input is in base a, and we have to convert to base b. So:\n\n        Step 1: Convert the string c (which is in base a) to a base-10 integer.\n\n    However, there's a catch: the input string may have digits that are represented by letters (for bases above 10). For example, base 12 might use digits up to 'B' (which is 11).\n\n    We need to map:\n        '0' -> 0, '1' -> 1, ... '9' -> 9, then 'A' -> 10, 'B' -> 11, ... up to the base.\n\n    But note: the base a is at least 2 and at most 25. So we can map each character to a digit value by:\n\n        If the character is between '0' and '9': then value = int(char)\n        Else if the character is between 'A' and the character representing (a-1): then value = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n\n    However, note: the input string might have digits that are not valid in base a? The problem states: \"a non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros\". So the digits must be valid.\n\n    But wait: what if base a is 10? Then digits must be from '0' to '9'. If base a is 16, then digits from '0' to 'F'. But note: the example input \"12 13\\nA\" -> base 12, so the digit 'A' represents 10, then we convert 10 (base 12) to base 13, which is 10 in base 13? Actually, 10 in base 12 is 10, then in base 13: 10 is still represented as 'A'? Or wait, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — but wait, that seems to be a typo. Actually, the example input says: \n        Input: \"12 13\\nA\" -> Output: \"A\"\n\n    How do we convert from base a to base 10?\n\n        Let s = input string (without spaces, and it may have leading zeros)\n\n        value = 0\n        for each char in s:\n            digit_value = \n                if char in '0'..'9': int(char)\n                else: 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n            value = value * a + digit_value\n\n    But note: the base a is given, and the string can be up to 1000 characters long. The number might be very large (if not Roman). However, the problem says: if b is not R, then the number is not greater than 10^15^10? Actually, the example says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\" — wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me read again: \n\n        \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n    But wait, 101510 is 10^5.15...? Actually, the problem says \"won't be greater than 101510\", meaning 101510? Or is it 10^1510? \n\n    Actually, the problem statement in the user message says: \n        \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n    But looking at the example: \n        \"2 2\\n1111001\" — this is base 2 and the string is \"1111001\", which is 121 in decimal. And 121 < 101510.\n\n    However, wait: the problem says \"the number\" (which is the integer value) in base a. But if the base is high, then the same string of digits can represent a very large number. \n\n    But note: the constraint says \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\". So even if the base is 25 and the string is 1000 digits, the actual integer value is bounded by 101510? \n\n    Actually, wait: the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\" — meaning when b is not R. And when b is R, the number is at most 300010.\n\n    However, note that the input string for base a can be up to 1000 digits, but if the base is small (like 2) then a 1000-digit number can be astronomically huge. But the guarantee only applies to the cases where the base is not R? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \n        \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n    This means that if b is not R, then the integer value (after converting from base a) is at most 101510. But wait, 101510 is about 10^5, so that's manageable.\n\n    However, wait: the example input \"2 2\\n1111001\" is base 2 and the number is 121, which is less than 101510. But what if we have base 2 with a string of 1000 ones? That would be 2^1000 - 1, which is way bigger than 101510. \n\n    There seems to be a contradiction. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n        \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n    Wait, it says \"its length doesn't exceed 103\", not 1000? Actually, the example input says \"length doesn't exceed 1000\", but the problem statement in the example input section says 1000. But the problem statement above says \"103\"? \n\n    Let me check the problem statement:\n\n        \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\"\n\n    Actually, the example input says 1000, but the problem statement says 103. I think the problem intended to say 1000. However, the guarantee on the value (when not Roman) is that the number is <= 101510.\n\n    Therefore, even though the string can be up to 1000 digits, the integer value (in base 10) is at most 101510 (if not Roman). So we can safely convert the entire string to a base-10 integer without worrying about extremely large numbers (because 101510 is about 10^5, which is within the range of Python integers).\n\n    But wait: if the base is 2 and the string is 1000 digits, then the integer value is 2^(n-1) + ... which is too big for n=1000. However, the problem guarantees that in non-Roman cases the integer value is <= 101510. Therefore, the string of 1000 digits in base 2 would only be valid if the integer value is <= 101510. So the string might have many zeros and ones, but the actual value is limited.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the string may contain leading zeros. So if the base is 2 and the integer value is 10, then the string might be \"0001010\" (which is 10 in base 2). But 10 is <= 101510, so that's okay.\n\n    But how to convert? We can convert the string to a base-10 integer, but if the base is large (say 25) and the string is 1000 digits, then the base-10 integer would be huge? \n\n    However, the problem says: in non-Roman cases, the integer value (the base-10 integer) is <= 101510. So even if the base is 25, the base-10 integer is at most 101510. Therefore, we can convert the entire string to base-10 by processing each digit and doing:\n\n        value = 0\n        for char in s:\n            d = char_to_digit(char, base_a)\n            value = value * base_a + d\n\n    But note: base_a is at most 25, and the base-10 integer is at most 101510 (non-Roman) or 300010 (Roman). So we can safely use Python integers.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Read the first line: split into tokens. One token is either integer or 'R'. The second token is the same.\n\n        Read the next line: the string c.\n\n        If b is 'R':\n            Convert the string c from base a to a base-10 integer (call it n). Then convert n to a Roman numeral string.\n        Else:\n            Convert the string c from base a to a base-10 integer (call it n).\n            Then convert n to base b (which is an integer).\n\n    But note: what if the base a is 10 and the string contains letters? Then the base a must be greater than 10 for letters to appear. So if base a is 10, then the digits must be from '0' to '9'. Similarly, base a is 16, then digits can be from '0' to 'F'.\n\n    How to convert from base a to base-10:\n\n        We'll create a helper function to convert a digit char to its numerical value, given the base.\n\n        Example: base 16, 'A' -> 10.\n\n        Steps for base conversion from base a to base 10:\n\n            num = 0\n            for each character in the string (from left to right, which is most significant first):\n                d = char_to_digit(char, base_a)   # This function returns the integer value of the char in base base_a.\n\n            Then: num = num * base_a + d\n\n    Now, what if the base-10 integer n is 0? Then we output \"0\", unless the base is R, but the problem says for Roman the number isn't 0.\n\n    Now, the conversion from base 10 to base b (if b is integer):\n\n        We have to convert the integer n (which is at most 101510 for non-Roman, or 300010 for Roman) to base b (which is between 2 and 25). We can do:\n\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"0\"\n            digits = []\n            while n:\n                remainder = n % b\n                n = n // b\n                digits.append(remainder)\n\n            Then reverse digits and convert each digit to the corresponding character.\n\n        But note: the digits in base b: \n            For base b, the digits go from 0 to b-1.\n            If the digit is less than 10, we use the char str(digit)\n            Otherwise, we use letters: starting from 'A' for 10, then 'B' for 11, etc.\n\n        However, what if b is 1? The problem states b>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n    But wait: the problem says the base b is between 2 and 25, so we can use letters up to 'Y' (if base is 25, then digits go from 0 to 24, so we need to represent 10 to 24). We can map:\n\n        For a digit d (0<=d<25), if d < 10: use str(d)\n                   else: use chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    Example: base 16, digit 10 -> 'A', 11->'B', ... 24->'O' (since 24-10=14, then 'A'+14 is 'O').\n\n    However, note: the example \"12 13\\nA\": \n        base a=12, string c=\"A\" -> convert to base10: \n            A in base12 is 10, so n=10.\n        Then convert 10 to base13: \n            base13: 10 is represented as 'A' (since 10 < 13, so one digit: 10 -> 'A')\n\n    Another example: base10 to base2: \n        Input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> base10, string \"1\" -> n=1, then base2: 1 -> \"1\"\n\n    But wait: the example \"16 R\\n5\": \n        base16, string \"5\" -> n=5, then convert to Roman: 5 -> 'V'\n\n    And \"5 R\\n4\": \n        base5, string \"4\" -> n=4, then Roman: 4 -> 'IV'\n\n    Now, the Roman numeral conversion:\n\n        We are guaranteed that the number is between 1 and 300010 (if Roman is chosen).\n\n        We need to convert a base-10 integer n (1 <= n <= 300010) to a Roman numeral string.\n\n        Standard Roman numerals: \n            M: 1000, CM: 900, D: 500, CD: 400, C: 100, XC: 90, L: 50, XL: 40, X: 10, IX: 9, V: 5, IV: 4, I: 1.\n\n        We can use a list of tuples (value, symbol) in descending order.\n\n        Steps for converting an integer to Roman:\n\n            roman_numerals = [\n                (1000, 'M'),\n                (900, 'CM'),\n                (500, 'D'),\n                (400, 'CD'),\n                (100, 'C'),\n                (90, 'XC'),\n                (50, 'L'),\n                (40, 'XL'),\n                (10, 'X'),\n                (9, 'IX'),\n                (5, 'V'),\n                (4, 'IV'),\n                (1, 'I')\n            ]\n\n            res = ''\n            for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n                while n >= value:\n                    res += symbol\n                    n -= value\n\n        Example: n=4 -> \n            4 < 1000, ... until we get to 5: 4<5, then 4>=4 -> use 'IV', then n becomes 0.\n\n        Example: n=9 -> \n            9 < 1000, ... until we get to 9: 9>=9 -> use 'IX'\n\n        Example: n=5 -> use 'V'\n\n        Example: n=6 -> 5: use 'V', then 1: use 'I' -> 'VI'\n\n        But wait: the example \"5 R\\n4\" is 4 -> IV, correct.\n\n        Example: n=1994 -> MCMXCIV.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the number is at most 300010. Our method with the standard list of symbols goes up to 1000 (M) and then 900 (CM) etc. But 300010 is 300010.\n\n        Break down 300010:\n\n        We can extend the list if necessary? \n\n        Actually, the standard symbols go up to 1000. But 300010 is 300000 + 10.\n\n        How to represent 300000? \n\n        According to the problem, the system is extended: the same rules apply. But the standard Roman numerals don't have a symbol for 300000. However, the problem does not specify beyond the standard ones. \n\n        But note: the problem says \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n        And also: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — but that was for the input representation, not for the Roman system.\n\n        The Roman system is fixed. However, the problem states that the number is at most 300010. \n\n        Let's see: 300010 = 300000 + 10.\n\n        We don't have a symbol for 1000000, so we use multiple Ms? But wait, 300000 = MMM followed by C (for 100) and then IX? Actually, no. \n\n        But wait, the problem does not specify the representation for numbers beyond 3999. However, the problem says the number is at most 300010. \n\n        Actually, 300010 is 300000 + 10. \n\n        How to represent 300000? \n\n        According to historical Roman numerals, they did not use numbers beyond 3999. But the problem says the number is up to 300010. \n\n        However, note that the problem says the input number (in base a) is converted to base10 and then to Roman. And the base10 number is at most 300010. \n\n        We can use the standard method for numbers up to 3999 and then for numbers above 3999, we break them down.\n\n        But 300010 is 300000 + 10. \n\n        We can use:\n\n            300000: three times 100000? But wait, we don't have a symbol for 100000. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the additive principle arbitrarily. \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the representation for numbers beyond 3999. But note: the example only goes up to 300010, which is 300000 + 10.\n\n        We can break 300000 as 3 * 100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000. \n\n        Actually, according to the problem's definition, the system is extended by the same rules. But the subtractive principle is only for the standard set (like IV, IX, etc.). \n\n        But note: the problem says \"the same for other bases\", meaning the representation of numbers in base a uses the same additive/subtractive rules? Actually, the problem says:\n\n            \"Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: ... and the same for other bases\"\n\n        So the same rules apply. But the standard set of symbols is fixed. \n\n        However, the problem says the number is at most 300010. We can use:\n\n            300000: MMM? But MMM is 3000, not 300000. \n\n        Wait, we can use M repeated 300 times? That would be 300000, but that's too long. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n            Since the problem does not specify, we can use the standard representation for numbers above 3999 by using parentheses or bars? But the problem doesn't mention that.\n\n        Actually, after checking the Wikipedia article, they do have a way to represent larger numbers by placing a bar over a symbol to multiply by 1000, but that's not mentioned here.\n\n        But note: the problem says the number is at most 300010. \n\n        Let me represent 300010:\n\n            Break it down: 300000 + 10.\n\n            How to represent 300000? \n\n            We can use 300000 = 3 * 100000, but we don't have a symbol for 100000.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use: \n                300000 = 3 * 1000 * 100, but that's not straightforward.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we don't need to handle numbers above 3999? Actually, 300010 is above 3999.\n\n        Let me check: the standard Roman numerals use:\n\n            I, V, X, L, C, D, M.\n\n            The largest number we can represent without extensions is 3999.\n\n        But the problem says the number can be up to 300010. \n\n        So we must extend the representation. \n\n        How did ancient Romans represent such numbers? They used a bar notation or simply added more symbols? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify. But note the example: the number is at most 300010, so we need to represent 300010.\n\n        We can use the following: \n\n            We can break the number into thousands and then use the standard representation for the thousands part, and then the rest.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the same rules: the additive and subtractive principles. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing\"\n\n        This implies that we can use the same symbols repeatedly. \n\n        So 300000 can be represented as:\n\n            MMM... (300 times M) — but that is 300000? No, one M is 1000, so 300 Ms would be 300000.\n\n        But that would be a very long string. However, 300010 is 300000 + 10, so:\n\n            MMM... (300 times) + X\n\n        But wait, 300 Ms is 300 * 1000 = 300000, then add X (10) -> 300010.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify a limit on the length of the Roman numeral string, but we know the number is at most 300010, so the maximum number of M's is 300 (for 300000). \n\n        But 300 M's is 300 characters, which is acceptable.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a more compact representation: \n\n            We can use the subtractive principle for thousands? But we don't have a symbol for 5000 or 10000.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the example only requires up to 300010, we can use the direct additive method for the thousands.\n\n        However, note: the standard representation for 4000 is usually represented as MMMM (if we don't use the bar) but that's 4000. So for 300000, we use 300 Ms.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the same rules as the base system? Actually, the problem says the same rules for the base system, but for Roman numerals, the base system part was about the digits. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" — that was for the input representation. The Roman numeral system is fixed.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            We'll use the standard subtractive rules for the standard symbols (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) and then for the thousands part, we simply repeat the M (or use other symbols) without subtractive? \n\n        But actually, the subtractive principle is defined for the standard set. So for thousands, we don't have subtractive? \n\n        The problem says: \"At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.\"\n\n        So for thousands, the subtractive principle is only for the lower ones (like CM for 900). For 9000, we would use CM? But CM is 900, not 9000.\n\n        Actually, the standard representation for 9000 is CM (as thousands)? No, CM is 900. For 9000, we use CM with a bar? Or we use multiple Ms? \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the number is only up to 300010, we can assume that we break the number into parts and use the standard subtractive rules for the entire number, including breaking the number into thousands, hundreds, etc.\n\n        However, 300010 is 300 thousands and 10. \n\n        We can break the number as:\n\n            300000: 300 * 1000 -> 300 Ms? But wait, that's not efficient. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same method as the standard algorithm for Roman numerals, but for numbers above 3999, we break the number by place value and use the standard subtractive rules for each place.\n\n        But note: the standard algorithm for Roman numerals (the one with the list of tuples) only works for numbers up to 3999.\n\n        How to handle 300000?\n\n        We can extend the list to include:\n\n            (1000000, ...) — but we don't have a symbol for 1000000.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break the number into groups of thousands, hundreds, tens, etc.\n\n        Actually, the problem says the number is at most 300010, which is 300000 + 10. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let n = 300010\n\n            Break n into: \n                thousands_part = n // 1000   -> 300\n                remainder = n % 1000          -> 10\n\n            Then convert the thousands_part (300) to Roman numerals for thousands, but note: the standard Roman numerals don't have a symbol for thousands beyond M.\n\n        But wait, we can use the fact that 300000 is 300 * 1000, and 1000 is M. So 300000 is MMM... (300 Ms). \n\n        Then the remainder 10 is X.\n\n        So the whole thing is 300 Ms and then X.\n\n        But 300 Ms is a lot. However, we can also use a more compact representation? \n\n        Actually, there's no standard compact representation for numbers above 3999. \n\n        But note: the problem does not require a minimal representation. So we can output 300 Ms and then X.\n\n        However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so the maximum number of M's is 300 (for 300000). \n\n        But 300 M's is 300 characters. Is that acceptable? The problem doesn't specify a limit on the length of the output.\n\n        But 300010 is 300010, and 300 M's is 300 characters, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can try to use the same subtractive principle for thousands? \n\n        But the subtractive principle is defined for the standard set. We don't have a symbol for 5000 (which would be V with a bar) or 10000 (X with a bar). \n\n        So we stick to additive for thousands.\n\n        Algorithm for Roman conversion for n (1 <= n <= 300010):\n\n            We can use the standard list of symbols, but we need to handle numbers above 3999.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                We can break the number into:\n\n                    thousands = n // 1000\n                    n %= 1000\n\n                    Then convert the thousands part by repeating 'M' thousands times.\n\n                    Then convert the remaining part (which is less than 1000) using the standard method.\n\n            Example: n=300010\n                thousands = 300, remaining = 10\n                Convert 300: we output 'M' * 300\n                Then convert 10: output 'X'\n\n            Example: n=4000\n                thousands = 4, remaining = 0\n                Convert 4: output 'M'*4 -> 'MMMM'\n\n            But wait, the standard representation for 4000 is sometimes written as MMMM, but also sometimes with a bar (like ̅M) for 5000, but we don't have that.\n\n            According to the problem, we are to use the same rules. The same rules say that we use additive repetition. \n\n            However, the subtractive principle is only for the defined symbols. Since 4000 is four thousand, we just use four Ms.\n\n            But note: the subtractive principle is for the same symbol repeated? Actually, the subtractive principle is for using a smaller symbol before a larger one. \n\n            For 4000, we cannot use subtractive because we don't have a larger symbol than M. \n\n            So we use additive.\n\n            Example: n=4000 -> \"MMMM\"\n\n            But wait, the standard representation for 4000 is sometimes written as MMMM, which is acceptable.\n\n            However, the problem says the number is at most 300010, so we don't have to worry about numbers beyond 300010.\n\n        But wait, what about numbers like 1999? \n\n            We use the standard method: \n                MCMXCIX\n\n            Now, let's code the Roman conversion:\n\n            Steps:\n\n                We'll have a list of tuples for the standard Roman numerals (up to 3999) and then separately handle the thousands part (above 3999) by breaking the number.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                roman_numerals = [\n                    (1000, 'M'),\n                    (900, 'CM'),\n                    (500, 'D'),\n                    (400, 'CD'),\n                    (100, 'C'),\n                    (90, 'XC'),\n                    (50, 'L'),\n                    (40, 'XL'),\n                    (10, 'X'),\n                    (9, 'IX'),\n                    (5, 'V'),\n                    (4, 'IV'),\n                    (1, 'I')\n                ]\n\n            Then, for numbers above 3999, we break the number:\n\n                n = 300010\n                # First, convert the thousands part (the part above 3999) by removing the thousands.\n\n            Actually, we can modify the algorithm to handle arbitrarily large numbers (within 300010) by:\n\n                while n >= 1000:\n                    count = n // 1000\n                    n %= 1000\n                    res += 'M' * count\n\n                Then use the standard method for the rest.\n\n            But wait, what about 4000? \n                n=4000 -> count=4, n becomes 0, then we output 'M'*4 -> 'MMMM'\n\n            What about 40000? \n                n=40000 -> count=40, then n=0, so output 'M'*40 -> 40 Ms.\n\n            But 40000 is 40000, and we are only required to handle up to 300010, so the maximum thousands part is 300.\n\n            However, the standard subtractive representation for 4000 is sometimes written as MMMM, but for 400000 we would use 400 Ms? \n\n            But 300010 is 300000+10, so 300 Ms and then X.\n\n            This approach is simple and meets the requirement.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the same rules. The standard rules for Roman numerals do not define subtractive for thousands, so we use additive.\n\n        So the Roman conversion function:\n\n            def",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of the target base being the Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input string from its given base to a decimal number, handling the conversion to Roman numerals if specified, and converting the decimal number to the target base if it's not Roman.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input string is converted from its original base `a` to a decimal number. Each character in the string is mapped to its corresponding digit value (0-9, A-Z for bases above 10). The decimal number is computed by processing each digit from left to right, multiplying the accumulated value by the base and adding the current digit's value.\n\n2. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals. This involves breaking down the number into parts that can be represented by Roman numeral symbols, using a list of value-symbol pairs in descending order. The conversion uses additive and subtractive principles as per standard Roman numeral rules.\n\n3. **Base Conversion to Target Base**: If the target base is an integer, the decimal number is converted to the specified base. The conversion involves repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders, which are then mapped to their corresponding digits (0-9, A-Z for bases above 10).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef char_to_digit(c, base):\n    if '0' <= c <= '9':\n        return ord(c) - ord('0')\n    else:\n        return 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A'))\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, base_a):\n    num = 0\n    for char in s:\n        d = char_to_digit(char, base_a)\n        num = num * base_a + d\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base_b):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        remainder = n % base_b\n        n = n // base_b\n        digits.append(remainder)\n    digits.reverse()\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    base_a_str = first_line[0]\n    base_b_str = first_line[1]\n    try:\n        base_a = int(base_a_str)\n    except:\n        base_a = base_a_str\n        \n    second_line = data[1].strip()\n    \n    if base_b_str == 'R':\n        n_dec = base_a_to_decimal(second_line, base_a)\n        if n_dec == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            roman_str = decimal_to_roman(n_dec)\n            print(roman_str)\n    else:\n        base_b = int(base_b_str)\n        n_dec = base_a_to_decimal(second_line, base_a)\n        result = decimal_to_base(n_dec, base_b)\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **char_to_digit**: This helper function converts a character (digit or letter) to its numerical value based on the given base.
