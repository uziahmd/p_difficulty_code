Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements.

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\nWe are given:\n1. An integer `n`\n2. A list of `n` integers `a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}`\n3. A string `s` (without spaces) of length `n` which is the binary representation of `m` (with leading zeros if necessary)\n\nNote: The function `f(x)` is defined as:\n   f(x) = sum_{i} [bit(i) in x] * a_i\n\nBut note: the indices of `a` are from 0 to n-1, and the binary representation of `x` has `n` bits? Actually, note that the problem says: \n   \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\nAnd then: \n   \"Number m equals ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} s_i * 2^i\"\n\nHowever, note that the array `a` has `n` elements, and the function `f(x)` uses the bits of `x` (which is a number from 0 to 2^n-1). But the binary representation of `m` is given with `n` digits. \n\nBut wait: the example input: \n   Input: \"2\\n3 8\\n10\"\n   Here, n=2, a=[3,8], m is given by binary string \"10\" (which is 2 in decimal).\n\nHowever, note that the problem states: \n   \"for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m\"\n\nBut also note: the function f(x) is defined using the first n bits? Or more? Actually, the definition of `bit(i)` for `x` is about the i-th bit. But the array `a` has only `n` elements. \n\nLooking at the example: \n   In the first test case, n=2, so we have two bits. Then x can be 0 or 1 (since m=2, so x from 0 to 2). But wait, the binary representation of 2 is '10', which has two digits. However, note that the problem says the third line is the binary representation of m, and the length of that string is n.\n\nSo, we are considering numbers x that are represented in base-2 with up to n bits? Actually, the problem says the function f(x) uses the bits from 0 to n-1 (because the array a has n elements). And x is from 0 to m, and m is given by an n-bit binary number.\n\nBut note: the example input says \"10\" for m, and then x can be 0 (binary '00') or 1 (binary '01') or 2 (binary '10')? However, wait: the problem says x is from 0 to m (inclusive). So for m=2, x can be 0,1,2.\n\nBut the function f(x) for x=0: no bits set -> 0.\n        x=1: bit0 set -> a0 = 3.\n        x=2: bit1 set -> a1 = 8.\n\nBut wait, the example output is 3. Why not 8? Because the condition is x<=m, and m=2. So x=2 is allowed. Then why the maximum is 3?\n\nWait, the example input says:\n   Input: \"2\\n3 8\\n10\"\n\nBut the example output is 3.\n\nLet me check: the problem says: \n   \"In the first test case m = 20 = 2, f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3, f(2)=a1=8\"\n\nThen the maximum should be 8. But the example output is 3.\n\nWait, there's a mistake in the example explanation? Let me read again:\n\n   \"In the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3\"\n\nWait, here it says m=20=1? That doesn't make sense. Actually, the example input is:\n\n   ['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\nAnd the outputs are:\n\n   ['3', '27']\n\nSo the first sample input is:\n\n   n=2\n   a = [3, 8]\n   m = 10 (binary) -> which is 2 in decimal.\n\nBut then",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from an array \\( a \\) where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of \\( x \\) is set. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that \\( f(x) \\) is maximized by setting as many bits as possible in \\( x \\) that correspond to the largest values in the array \\( a \\). However, \\( x \\) must not exceed \\( m \\), which is given as an n-bit binary number.\n\n2. **Intuition**: We can think of this problem as a variant of the classic \"maximum subset sum\" problem but with constraints based on the binary representation of \\( m \\). The solution involves traversing the binary digits of \\( m \\) from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB) and deciding whether to set each bit in \\( x \\) or not, while ensuring \\( x \\) does not exceed \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Converting the binary string of \\( m \\) into a list of integers (0s and 1s).\n   - Iterating from the MSB to LSB, keeping track of whether we have encountered a '1' in \\( m \\) so far (this determines if we are restricted by \\( m \\)).\n   - For each bit position, if the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is '1', we can choose to set the bit in \\( x \\) only if it contributes positively to the sum (i.e., if \\( a[i] \\) is positive). If the bit is '0', we cannot set it unless we have not yet encountered any '1' in \\( m \\) (meaning we are still in the leading zeros part).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each bit of \\( m \\) exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of bits in \\( m \\). This is efficient given the constraint \\( n \\leq 10^5 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    s = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total = 0\n    tight = True\n    for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):\n        bit_char = s[i]\n        if not tight:\n            if bit_char == '1':\n                total += a[i]\n        else:\n            if bit_char == '1':\n                if a[i] >= 0:\n                    total += a[i]\n            else:\n                tight = False\n                \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n- **Initialization**: We initialize `total` to accumulate the sum of selected bits and `tight` to keep track if we are constrained by the binary digits of \\( m \\).\n- **Processing Bits**: We iterate from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) of \\( m \\):\n  - If we are still in the \"tight\" constraint (meaning all preceding bits were '1's in \\( m \\)), we check the current bit:\n    - If the bit is '1' and the corresponding element in \\( a \\) is non-negative, we add it to `total`.\n    - If the bit is '0', we switch off the tight constraint, allowing all subsequent bits to be set freely (as long as they contribute positively).\n  - If we are no longer in the tight constraint, we can freely set bits if they contribute positively to the sum.\n- **Output**: The accumulated `total` is printed, which is the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the constraints imposed by \\( m \\) while maximizing the sum by leveraging the positions of bits that contribute positively to the function \\( f(x) \\).",
