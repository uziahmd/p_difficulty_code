    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum (or both) of the entire array.\n\n Observation:\n The instability of the array is defined as max - min.\n After removing one element, the new array's instability will be (max of remaining) - (min of remaining).\n\n We note that if we remove an element that is not the current min or max, then the min and max of the entire array remain unchanged, so the instability remains the same.\n\n Therefore, the only candidates for removal are:\n   - The global minimum\n   - The global maximum\n\n However, note that there might be multiple occurrences of min and max. So we have to consider:\n\n Option 1: Remove one occurrence of the global minimum. Then the new min is the next smallest value (which could be the same if there are duplicates) but the max remains the same unless we removed a max as well? Actually, if we remove one occurrence, the max is still the same unless we removed the only max? But wait, we are removing one element.\n\n Actually, we can think about two possibilities:\n\n Possibility 1: Removing the smallest element. Then the new array's minimum becomes the second smallest (if there was at least two elements originally). The maximum remains the same (unless the smallest element was also the maximum, which would be the case if all elements are equal).\n\n Possibility 2: Removing the largest element. Then the new array's maximum becomes the second largest, and the minimum remains the same.\n\n But note: There could be cases where we remove an element that is both the smallest and the largest? Actually, if the array has only one distinct value, then removing any element leaves the array with all same values, so instability 0.\n\n However, the above two possibilities are independent. But what if the array has more than two distinct values? Then we have two candidate removals: one from the min and one from the max.\n\n But wait: sometimes removing an element that is neither the min nor the max might actually change the min or max? No, because if you remove an element that is not the min, then the min remains. Similarly for the max.\n\n Therefore, we must consider two scenarios:\n\n Scenario 1: Remove the smallest element. Then the new min is the next smallest (which is the original min if there are duplicates, but if we remove one occurrence then the next smallest is the next distinct value or the same if duplicate exists). Actually, we need the next smallest distinct value? Not exactly: we need the overall min of the remaining array.\n\n However, we can precompute:\n\n Let the sorted array be `b`.\n Then, the original instability is b[-1] - b[0].\n\n If we remove the first element (the smallest), then the new min is b[1] (if n>=2, because we have at least two elements) and the max is b[-1]. Then instability becomes b[-1] - b[1].\n\n Similarly, if we remove the last element (the largest), then the new max is b[-2] and the min is b[0], so instability becomes b[-2] - b[0].\n\n But what if we remove an element that is somewhere in the middle? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is unchanged.\n\n Therefore, the minimum instability we can get is the minimum among:\n   original_instability (if we remove an element that is not min or max, but that doesn't change the instability) -> but wait, we are required to remove exactly one element, and we want the minimal instability.\n\n Actually, we are allowed to choose any one element. So we can choose to remove the min or the max or something else. But note:\n\n   - If we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the min and max remain the same, so the instability remains (b[-1]-b[0]).\n   - If we remove the min, then the instability becomes (b[-1] - b[1]).\n   - If we remove the max, then the instability becomes (b[-2] - b[0]).\n\n However, there's a catch: what if there are multiple minima or maxima? For example, [1,1,3,7]: \n   Removing one of the 1's: \n        Original: min=1, max=7, instability=6.\n        After removing one 1: min=1 (because there's another 1) and max=7, instability=6.\n        But if we remove the other 1: same.\n\n So we need to consider the possibility of duplicates.\n\n Actually, the above two scenarios (removing min or removing max) are not enough if there are duplicates. Because if we remove a min, the new min is the next distinct value only if there was no duplicate? \n\n Let me clarify:\n\n Example: [1,1,2,3,4]\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can potentially change either the minimum or the maximum (or both) values of the array. The optimal solution involves either:\n   - Removing the smallest element, which might reduce the range if there are duplicate minimum values.\n   - Removing the largest element, which might reduce the range if there are duplicate maximum values.\n   \n2. **Intuition**: The minimal instability after removal will be the smallest among three scenarios:\n   - The original instability (if no removal affects the min or max).\n   - The instability after removing the smallest element (new min is the next smallest element).\n   - The instability after removing the largest element (new max is the next largest element).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n   - Calculate the original instability.\n   - Compute the instability after removing the smallest element (if applicable).\n   - Compute the instability after removing the largest element (if applicable).\n   - The answer is the minimum value among these scenarios.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 10^5). The subsequent operations are O(1), making the overall complexity dominated by the sorting step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    arr_sorted = sorted(arr)\n    instability_original = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[0]\n    \n    candidate1 = instability_original\n    candidate2 = instability_original\n    candidate3 = instability_original\n    \n    if n >= 2:\n        candidate1 = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[1]\n        candidate2 = arr_sorted[-2] - arr_sorted[0]\n        \n    min_instability = min(candidate1, candidate2, instability_original)\n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements and the array itself.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has only one element, the instability is trivially 0.\n- **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n- **Instability Calculation**: The original instability is the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.\n- **Candidate Scenarios**: \n  - **Removing the smallest element**: The new instability is the difference between the largest element and the second smallest element.\n  - **Removing the largest element**: The new instability is the difference between the second largest element and the smallest element.\n- **Result**: The minimum value among the original instability and the two candidate scenarios is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to three key scenarios, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
