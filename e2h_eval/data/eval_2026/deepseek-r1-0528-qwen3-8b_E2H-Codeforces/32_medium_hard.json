    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum value.\n Since the instability is defined as (max - min), we note that if we remove an element, the new instability is:\n   max_remaining - min_remaining\n\n The key observation: \n   The original array has a global min (let's call it `min_val`) and global max (`max_val`).\n\n If we remove an element that is not the current min or max, then the min and max of the remaining array remain the same.\n\n However, if we remove the only occurrence of the global min, then the new min becomes the next smallest number (which is at least `min_val` but we don't have it anymore).\n Similarly, if we remove the only occurrence of the global max, then the new max becomes the next largest number (which is at most `max_val`).\n\n But note: there could be duplicate values. So we must consider the frequency of the min and max.\n\n Actually, we can break down the possibilities:\n\n Possibility 1: Remove an element that is the global min (if there is at least one global min). Then the new min is the smallest element that is not the global min.\n Possibility 2: Remove an element that is the global max (if there is at least one global max). Then the new max is the largest element that is not the global max.\n\n However, what if we remove an element that is both the global min and global max? Then the array has only one distinct value and the instability is 0.\n\n But note: we are allowed to remove exactly one element.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n We know that the instability of the entire array is `max_val - min_val`.\n\n When we remove an element, the instability of the resulting array is:\n   candidate1 = max_val - next_min (if we remove the min)\n   candidate2 = next_max - min_val (if we remove the max)\n\n But note: if we remove an element that is neither the min nor the max, then the instability remains `max_val - min_val`. So we are not interested in that because we want to minimize.\n\n Therefore, we can consider two scenarios:\n\n Scenario 1: Removing an occurrence of the global min (if exists). Then the new min is the next smallest value (which we can precompute) and the max remains the same. The instability becomes `max_val - next_min`.\n\n Scenario 2: Removing an occurrence of the global max (if exists). Then the new max is the next largest value and the min remains the same. The instability becomes `next_max - min_val`.\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is both the global min and global max? Then we have to consider that the array without that element might have a different min and max.\n\n However, note that if the array has all the same numbers, then after removal the instability is 0. This is covered by:\n\n   Scenario 1: Removing the min (which is also the max) -> the next_min would be the same as min_val? Actually, no: if we remove one occurrence and there are duplicates, then the next_min is still min_val. But wait, if we remove one occurrence and there is another min_val, then the min doesn't change.\n\n So we must consider: \n\n   Let the sorted array be `b`.\n   The original min = b[0], max = b[-1].\n\n   We are going to consider:\n\n   candidate1: Remove the first occurrence (the min) -> then the new min is the next distinct number? Actually, we should take the next smallest value which is the next element in the sorted array that is greater than the min. But note: there could be duplicates.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let `min_val = b[0]`, `max_val = b[-1]`.\n\n   Consider candidate from removing an element that is `min_val`:\n\n        new_min = b[0] but if we remove one occurrence, then the new min is the smallest value that is not `min_val`? Not exactly: if there are multiple `min_val`, then the new min is still `min_val` (because we only remove one). So actually, we need to consider:\n\n        candidate_remove_min = max_val - (the smallest value in the array that is >= min_val, but if we remove one min, then the min might drop only if we remove the last occurrence? No, because if there are duplicates, then even after removal, the min remains.)\n\n   Therefore, we should compute:\n\n        Option 1: Remove one occurrence of the global min. Then the new min is the smallest value in the array that is not less than the global min. But if there are multiple mins, then the min doesn't change. So the instability becomes `max_val - (min_val)` if there is still at least one min left, but wait: we removed one min, so if there was more than one min, then the min remains. Otherwise, if we remove the last min, then the new min becomes the next value.\n\n   Similarly for max.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n   Let:\n        left = 0, right = n-1\n        We sort the array.\n\n   Then, we can consider:\n\n        candidate1: Remove the first element (if there are duplicates, we can remove one occurrence and the min might stay the same or change)\n\n   Instead, we can think of:\n\n        We want to try every possibility of removal and compute the instability. But that would be O(n) and n can be 10^5, and each computation of min and max for n-1 elements is O(n). Total O(n^2) which is too slow.\n\n   We need an efficient way.\n\n   Alternative Insight:\n\n        The instability of the array without one element is the difference between the maximum and minimum of the remaining array.\n\n        The maximum of the remaining array is at least `b[0]` and at most `b[-1]`, but we are removing one element.\n\n        The best scenario is to get an array with the same min and max as the original, but that doesn't help because we want to minimize the range.\n\n        However, note that the removal can only reduce the range if we remove one of the extreme values.\n\n        Actually, we can consider two cases:\n\n        Case 1: Remove an element that is the global min. Then the new array has min = \n                if the original min appears only once: then the new min is the next smallest value (which is b[1])? But wait, what if there are multiple mins? Then the new min is still the original min.\n\n        So we need to know the frequency of the min and max.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Sort the array.\n          2. Let min_val = b[0], max_val = b[-1]\n\n          3. We can consider:\n\n            candidate_ans = float('inf')\n\n            # If we remove an element that is the min, then the new min is the smallest value in the array that is not the min (if the min is removed and there is no other min, then we have to take the next one) OR if there are multiple mins, then the min remains.\n\n            Actually, we can consider:\n\n            Option A: Remove the first element (the smallest) and then the new min is the next element (unless there are duplicates, but then we can remove one and the min remains the same). \n\n            However, we don't know which element to remove. We can consider two possibilities:\n\n            Possibility 1: Remove the global min (if present) and then the instability is:\n                instability1 = max_val - (min_val if there exists at least two min_vals else b[1])\n\n            But wait, if there are multiple min_vals, then even after removal, the min remains min_val. So:\n\n                instability1 = max_val - (min_val if (count_min > 1) else (b[1] if n>=2 else b[0]))\n\n            Similarly, Possibility 2: Remove the global max (if present) and then the instability is:\n                instability2 = (max_val if count_max > 1 else b[-2]) - min_val\n\n            But note: what if we remove an element that is in the middle? Then the instability remains the same as the original, but that might be worse than one of the above?\n\n            Actually, we are trying to minimize the instability. So we have to consider:\n\n                candidate1: remove an element that is the min -> then instability = max_val - (min_val if there are multiple mins else b[1])\n                candidate2: remove an element that is the max -> then instability = (max_val if there are multiple maxes else b[-2]) - min_val\n\n            But wait, what if we remove an element that is not the min nor the max? Then the instability remains max_val - min_val, which is the original. And we are looking for the minimum.\n\n            However, note: sometimes removing a non-extreme element might not help, but we are allowed to choose any. So we can also consider:\n\n            candidate3: remove an element that is neither min nor max? But then the instability is the same as the original. However, maybe we don't need to consider that because if we can get a lower instability by removing an extreme, then we don't care about the same.\n\n            But note: sometimes the original instability is already low, and removing an extreme might make it higher? \n\n            Example: [1,2,3] \n                Original instability: 2.\n                Remove 1: [2,3] -> instability 1.\n                Remove 2: [1,3] -> instability 2.\n                Remove 3: [1,2] -> instability 1.\n\n            In this example, the best is 1.\n\n            However, note that the original array's instability is 2, and we can achieve 1.\n\n            But what if we have [1, 100, 101]?\n                Original instability: 100.\n                Remove 1: [100,101] -> instability 1.\n                Remove 100: [1,101] -> instability 100.\n                Remove 101: [1,100] -> instability 99.\n\n            So we must consider the removal of the min and the removal of the max.\n\n            However, note that the above candidate formulas:\n\n                For [1,100,101]:\n                    min_val = 1, max_val=101\n                    Count_min: 1, so removing min gives: 101 - b[1] = 101-100 = 1.\n                    Count_max: 1, so removing max gives: b[-2]-min_val = 100-1 = 99.\n\n            So the minimum is min(1, 99) = 1.\n\n            Another example: [1,2,3] \n                Removing min: max_val (3) - (min_val if count_min>1 else b[1]) -> 3 - (1 if count_min>1 else 2). Since count_min=1, then 3-2=1.\n                Removing max: (max_val if count_max>1 else b[-2]) - min_val -> (3 if count_max>1 else 2) - 1. Since count_max=1, then 2-1=1.\n\n            But wait, what if we remove the middle element? Then the instability is 3-1=2, which is worse. So we don't consider that.\n\n            However, what if the array has duplicates? Example: [1,1,3]\n                Original: min=1, max=3, instability=2.\n                Possibilities:\n                  Remove one of the 1s: then the array becomes [1,3] -> instability 2.\n                  Remove the 3: then the array becomes [1,1] -> instability 0.\n\n                So according to our candidate for removing the max: \n                  count_max=1 -> so we use b[-2]=1, then instability = 1-1 = 0.\n\n                Candidate for removing the min: \n                  count_min=2 -> so we use min_val=1, then instability = 3-1 = 2.\n\n                So the answer is min(2,0)=0.\n\n            So the formula for candidate1 (removing min) should be:\n                instability1 = max_val - (min_val if the first element appears more than once? Actually, no: we remove one occurrence, so if there are multiple mins, then the min remains min_val. But if we remove one min, then the min is still min_val (because there's at least one left). \n\n                However, wait: if we remove one occurrence, then the new min is the smallest value in the array without that occurrence. \n\n                How to compute that quickly?\n\n            Let's reframe:\n\n            After removing an element, the new min is:\n                If we remove an element that is greater than the current min, then the min remains min_val.\n                If we remove the only occurrence of min_val, then the new min is the next smallest value (which is the first value in the sorted array that is greater than min_val).\n\n            Similarly for max.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n            Let b = sorted(a)\n\n            candidate1: remove an occurrence of the min (if exists) -> \n                if b[0] == b[1]: then the min remains the same, so instability1 = b[-1] - b[0]\n                else: the min increases to b[1], so instability1 = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n            Similarly, candidate2: remove an occurrence of the max (if exists) ->\n                if b[-1] == b[-2]: then the max remains the same, so instability2 = b[-1] - b[0]\n                else: the max decreases to b[-2], so instability2 = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n            But wait, what if we remove an element that is the min and also the max? Then we have to consider both conditions.\n\n            However, note: if the array has all same numbers, then b[0]==b[-1]. Then:\n\n                candidate1: if b[0]==b[1] -> yes, then instability1 = b[-1]-b[0] = 0.\n                candidate2: if b[-1]==b[-2] -> yes, then instability2 = b[-2]-b[0] = 0.\n\n            But what if we remove an element that is the min and the max? Then we are effectively removing one occurrence, and the array still has the same value. Then the instability is 0.\n\n            However, the above two candidates are computed independently. What if we remove an element that is both the min and the max? Then we are removing one occurrence of the same value. Then:\n\n                candidate1: since there is at least one duplicate (because the value is the same as the max and we are removing one, then there must be at least two of them) -> so we use the condition for duplicate min? Actually, we don't know the frequency.\n\n            We can also consider: \n\n            candidate3: remove an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then the instability is the original? But we don't need to consider that because we are minimizing and we can always choose to remove an extreme if it gives a better result.\n\n            However, note: sometimes removing an extreme might not help (like in [1,2,100]), but in that case we have:\n\n                candidate1 (remove min): \n                    b = [1,2,100]\n                    min_val=1, max_val=100.\n                    Condition for min: b[0]!=b[1] -> so instability1 = 100-2 = 98.\n                candidate2 (remove max):\n                    Condition for max: b[-1]!=b[-2] -> so instability2 = 99-1 = 98.\n\n            But wait, the original instability is 99. And the minimum we can get is 98? \n\n            However, note: we are allowed to remove exactly one element. And the example [1,2,100] has three elements. \n\n            Let's check:\n\n                Remove 1: [2,100] -> instability 98.\n                Remove 2: [1,100] -> instability 99.\n                Remove 100: [1,2] -> instability 1.\n\n            So the above candidate formulas did not account for the possibility of removing an element that is not the global min or global max? \n\n            Correction: We must consider that when we remove an element that is the min, we don't necessarily have to use the next min (which is the second element) as the new min. Actually, the entire array's min is the smallest element. In [1,2,100], if we remove 1, then the min becomes 2.\n\n            But the above candidate1 calculation for [1,2,100] is correct: \n                candidate1: instability1 = 100 - 2 = 98.\n\n            Now candidate2: \n                candidate2: instability2 = 99 - 1 = 98.\n\n            But wait, we have a third candidate: removing 2 (which is not the min nor the max) leads to 1. \n\n            Why didn't we consider that? \n\n            Because our candidate formulas only considered removal of the min and removal of the max. \n\n            However, note: the problem says we can remove exactly one element. We are allowed to remove any element. \n\n            But the above two candidates (removing min and removing max) are the only ones that can potentially reduce the instability. Removing an element that is neither min nor max cannot reduce the instability because the min and max remain the same.\n\n            However, wait: in the example [1,2,100], removing the middle element (2) reduces the instability from 99 to 1? That's because the max was 100 and the min was 1. After removing 2, the min is still 1 and the max is still 100? \n\n            Actually, no: the array after removing 2 is [1,100]. The min is 1 and the max is 100, so the instability is 99, not 1.\n\n            I made a mistake: \n                [1,2,100] -> remove 2 -> [1,100] -> instability = 100-1 = 99.\n\n            Then why did I think 1? \n\n            Wait, let me recalc: \n                Original: [1,2,100] -> min=1, max=100, instability=99.\n                Remove 1: [2,100] -> min=2, max=100, instability=98.\n                Remove 2: [1,100] -> min=1, max=100, instability=99.\n                Remove 100: [1,2] -> min=1, max=2, instability=1.\n\n            So the best is 1.\n\n            Why didn't candidate2 for removing max work? \n\n            candidate2: remove the max (100) -> then the new max is the next largest, which is 2 (because the array becomes [1,2]). So the instability = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\n            But wait, how did we compute candidate2? \n\n            We said: candidate2 = (max_val if count_max>1 else b[-2]) - min_val\n\n            For [1,2,100]: \n                count_max (for 100) is 1, so we use b[-2]=2, then 2-1=1.\n\n            So that is correct.\n\n            Now, why did I initially think candidate2 was 98? \n\n            I did: candidate2 = (max_val if count_max>1 else b[-2]) - min_val -> (100 if count_max>1 else 2) - 1.\n\n            Since count_max=1, we use 2, then 2-1=1.\n\n            So the candidate2 calculation is correct.\n\n            Then why did I think candidate2 was 98? \n\n            I mistakenly thought: candidate2 = (max_val if count_max>1 else b[-2]) - min_val -> (if count_max>1 then use max_val, else use b[-2]) and then subtract min_val.\n\n            In [1,2,100]: \n                max_val=100, but we are using b[-2]=2 because count_max==1 -> so 2-1=1.\n\n            So the candidate2 is 1.\n\n            Then the answer is min( candidate1, candidate2 ) = min(98, 1) = 1.\n\n            But wait, candidate1 was 98 and candidate2 was 1. \n\n            However, we must note: we are allowed to remove any element. The above two candidates are the results of removing the min and removing the max respectively. \n\n            But what about removing an element that is not the min nor the max? In this case, removing the min and the max are the two extremes. \n\n            However, note: the above candidate formulas do not consider the possibility of removing an element that is not the min nor the max. But in fact, removing an element that is not the min nor the max leaves the min and max unchanged, so the instability remains 99. \n\n            So the minimal instability we can get is the minimum among:\n\n                candidate1 (remove min): 98\n                candidate2 (remove max): 1\n                candidate_other: 99\n\n            So the minimum is 1.\n\n            But wait, why did candidate1 (removing min) yield 98? \n\n            Removing the min (1) yields [2,100] -> min=2, max=100, so 98.\n\n            And candidate2 (removing max) yields [1,2] -> min=1, max=2, so 1.\n\n            So the answer is 1.\n\n            Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n\n            Step 2: Sort the list.\n\n            Step 3: Let b = sorted(a)\n\n            Step 4: Compute:\n                candidate1 = None, candidate2 = None\n\n                candidate1: if we remove the first occurrence (min) then:\n                    if the first two elements are equal (b[0] == b[1]): \n                        Then the min remains the same -> instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n                    else:\n                        Then the min becomes b[1] -> instability = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n                candidate2: if we remove the last occurrence (max) then:\n                    if the last two elements are equal (b[-1] == b[-2]):\n                        Then the max remains the same -> instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n                    else:\n                        Then the max becomes b[-2] -> instability = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n            However, wait: in the example [1,2,100] we saw that candidate2 was computed by taking the next largest (b[-2]) and subtracting the min (b[0]). \n\n            But note: candidate2 is defined by removing the max. The min remains the same (b[0]) because we are not touching the min. So the formula is correct.\n\n            But wait: what if we have an array like [1,1,2,3]? \n                Original: min=1, max=3, instability=2.\n                Removing one min: \n                    Condition: first two are equal -> so candidate1 = 3-1 = 2.\n                Removing the max:\n                    Condition: last two: 3 and 2 are not equal -> candidate2 = 2-1 = 1.\n\n                Then the answer is 1.\n\n            However, let's check:\n\n                Array: [1,1,2,3] -> remove one occurrence of 1: [1,2,3] -> instability 2.\n                Array: [1,1,2,3] -> remove 3: [1,1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability 1.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            But wait: what if we remove the other 1? Then the array is [1,2,3] -> same as above.\n\n            So the candidate1 calculation: we assume that we remove one occurrence of the min. The condition for candidate1 is based on whether the first two are equal. \n\n            However, what if the array is [1,2,2,3]?\n                Removing the min (1): \n                    Condition: first two (1 and 2) are not equal -> so candidate1 = 3 - 2 = 1.\n                Removing the max (3): \n                    Condition: last two (3 and 2) are not equal -> candidate2 = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\n            Check:\n                Remove 1: [2,2,3] -> instability 3-2=1.\n                Remove 3: [1,2,2] -> instability 2-1=1.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            However, consider an array with more than two distinct values and duplicates in the middle? \n\n            But note: the above candidate1 and candidate2 are only based on the first two and last two. \n\n            Why is that sufficient?\n\n            Explanation:\n\n            candidate1: \n                We remove one occurrence of the smallest element. \n                If there is at least two smallest elements (so the second smallest is the same as the smallest), then the smallest element remains and the instability is the original range (max-min).\n                If there is only one smallest element, then the smallest element becomes the next distinct value (which is b[1]), so the instability becomes max - b[1].\n\n            Similarly for candidate2.\n\n            But wait: what if the array has multiple distinct values and we remove the min, but the min is duplicated but not consecutive in the sorted array? \n\n            Actually, sorting the array ensures that the smallest value is at the beginning. The next distinct value (if we remove one occurrence of the min) is the first value that is greater than the min. And that is b[1] (because the array is sorted). \n\n            However, what if the array is [1,1,1,2,3]? Then removing one 1 leaves the min as 1, so candidate1 = 3-1=2.\n\n            But wait, the condition: first two are 1 and 1 -> so we use the same min. Correct.\n\n            So the algorithm is:\n\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                b = sorted(a)\n\n                # If the entire array is the same, then after removal the instability is 0? Actually, no: if we remove one element from [x,x,...,x] then the remaining array has all x, so the instability is 0.\n\n                # But our candidate1 and candidate2 will be:\n                #   candidate1: if b[0]==b[1] -> then instability1 = b[-1]-b[0] = 0 (if all same) -> but wait, if all same, then b[-1]==b[0] and the condition holds, so 0.\n                #   candidate2: similarly 0.\n\n                # However, let's do [1,1,1]:\n                #   candidate1: b[0]==b[1] -> True, so candidate1 = 1-1 = 0.\n                #   candidate2: b[-1]==b[-2] -> True, so candidate2 = 1-1=0.\n\n                # So the answer is 0.\n\n                # But wait, what if the array is [1,1,2]?\n                #   candidate1: b[0]==b[1] -> True -> candidate1 = 2-1 = 1.\n                #   candidate2: b[-1]==b[-2] -> False (last two: 2 and 1) -> candidate2 = 1-1 = 0.\n\n                # Check: [1,1,2] -> remove the max (2) -> [1,1] -> instability 0. Correct.\n\n            However, wait: [1,1,2] -> \n                candidate1: removing min -> [1,2] -> instability 1.\n                candidate2: removing max -> [1,1] -> instability 0.\n\n            So the answer is 0.\n\n            But note: the above candidate1 condition for [1,1,2] is true (first two are 1) so candidate1 = 2-1=1.\n\n            Now, the problem: the above two candidates are the only two we consider. But is that sufficient?\n\n            We must consider: what if we remove an element that is not the min nor the max? Then the instability is the original (which is 1). But 0 is better.\n\n            So we are good.\n\n            However, note: the above candidate formulas are:\n\n                candidate1 = (b[-1] - b[0]) if (b[0] == b[1]) else (b[-1] - b[1])\n                candidate2 = (b[-1] - b[0]) if (b[-1] == b[-2]) else (b[-2] - b[0])\n\n            But wait, the candidate2 formula is: \n                If the last two are equal, then we use the original max (so the instability is the original range) because we remove one occurrence of the max and there is another max, so the max doesn't change.\n                Else, we use the next largest (b[-2]) and subtract the min (b[0]).\n\n            However, note: the min is always the first element (b[0]) because we are removing an element that is the max, so the min remains the same (if the min is not the same as the max, but if the array is [1,1,2] then the min is 1 and the max is 2, and we remove the 2 -> the min remains 1). \n\n            But what if the array is [1,2,3] and we remove the max (3)? Then the min is still 1, so the instability is 2-1=1.\n\n            However, note: the above candidate2 formula uses b[-2] (which is 2) and subtracts b[0] (1) -> 1.\n\n            Now, what if the array is [1,2,3,4] and we remove the max (4)? Then the instability is 3-1=2.\n\n            According to candidate2: \n                Condition: last two (4 and 3) are not equal -> so candidate2 = 3-1=2.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            But note: the above candidate1 and candidate2 are computed independently. However, we must consider that the array might have multiple candidates for removal? \n\n            Actually, we are allowed to remove exactly one element, and the two candidates we consider (removing an occurrence of the min and removing an occurrence of the max) are the only two that can change the min or the max. \n\n            But wait: what if the array has two distinct values, say [1,2,2,3]? Then the min is 1 and the max is 3.\n\n            candidate1: remove min (1) -> then the min becomes 2, and the max is 3 -> instability 1.\n            candidate2: remove max (3) -> then the max becomes 2, and the min is 1 -> instability 1.\n\n            So the answer is 1.\n\n            However, note: there might be a scenario where removing an element that is not the min nor the max can yield a lower instability? \n\n            Example: [1,2,3,100] \n                Original: min=1, max=100 -> instability 99.\n\n                candidate1: remove min (1) -> [2,3,100] -> min=2, max=100 -> 98.\n                candidate2: remove max (100) -> [1,2,3] -> min=1, max=3 -> 2.\n\n                So the answer is 2.\n\n            But wait, is there a way to get less than 2? \n\n                Removing 2: [1,3,100] -> min=1, max=100 -> 99.\n                Removing 3: [1,2,100] -> min=1, max=100 -> 99.\n\n            So 2 is the minimum.\n\n            However, note: our candidate2 calculation for [1,2,3,100]:\n                candidate2: condition for max: last two (100 and 3) are not equal -> so candidate2 = 3-1 = 2.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            But wait: what if the array is [1,2,100,101]?\n                Original: min=1, max=101 -> 100.\n\n                candidate1: remove 1 -> [2,100,101] -> min=2, max=101 -> 99.\n                candidate2: remove 101 -> [1,2,100] -> min=1, max=100 -> 99.\n\n                But wait, what if we remove 2? \n                    [1,100,101] -> min=1, max=101 -> 100.\n                remove 100? \n                    [1,2,101] -> min=1, max=101 -> 100.\n\n                So the minimum is 99.\n\n            However, the above candidate1 and candidate2 give 99 and 99, so the answer is 99.\n\n            But wait, is 99 the minimum? \n\n            Actually, we can also consider: the instability of the entire array without 1 is 99, without 101 is 99, and without any other element is 100. So 99 is the minimum.\n\n            Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                b = sorted(a)\n\n                # Consider candidate1: removing the first element (min)\n                if n == 2:\n                    # Then we have two elements. Removing one, we get one element -> instability 0? But wait, the problem says the array has at least 2 elements, and we remove one -> then one element. The instability of one element is 0.\n                    # But our formula: \n                    #   candidate1: if b[0]==b[1] -> then candidate1 = b[-1]-b[0] = 0.\n                    #   candidate2: if b[-1]==b[-2] -> then candidate2 = b[-1]-b[0]=0.\n                    # So we can handle with the general method.\n\n                # However, the above general method works for n>=2.\n\n                candidate1 = float('inf')\n                candidate2 = float('inf')\n\n                # candidate1: remove one occurrence of the min\n                if b[0] == b[1]:\n                    # There is at least two mins, so after removal the min remains b[0]\n                    candidate1 = b[-1] - b[0]\n                else:\n                    candidate1 = b[-1] - b[1]\n\n                # candidate2: remove one occurrence of the max\n                if b[-1] == b[-2]:\n                    candidate2 = b[-1] - b[0]\n                else:\n                    candidate2 = b[-2] - b[0]\n\n                ans = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n                print(ans)\n\n            But wait, in the example [1,1,2] we got candidate1=1 and candidate2=0, so the answer 0. Correct.\n\n            However, wait: what if the array is [1,2,3,4] and we remove the min, the instability becomes 3 (from 4-1 originally) to 3 (4-1=3, but wait: no, removing 1: [2,3,4] -> 4-2=2). \n\n            But our candidate1 for [1,2,3,4]:\n                Condition: b[0]==b[1] -> 1==2?

Then the instability becomes 5-2=3.\n\n            But wait, the original instability was 4, and we reduced it to 3. \n\n            But note: we are allowed to remove any element, and we are only considering removal of min and max. \n\n            But is that sufficient? \n\n            Consider: [1,2,100,101] (as above) -> we found the answer by candidate1 and candidate2. \n\n            However, what if the array is [1,2,3,100,101]? \n                Original: min=1, max=101, instability=100.\n\n                candidate1: remove min -> [2,3,100,101] -> min=2, max=101 -> 99.\n                candidate2: remove max -> [1,2,3,100] -> min=1, max=100 -> 99.\n\n                But what if we remove 3? \n                    [1,2,100,101] -> min=1, max=101 -> 100.\n                remove 100?\n                    [1,2,3,101] -> min=1, max=101 -> 100",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can potentially reduce the instability if that element is either the minimum or the maximum of the array. If the removed element is the only occurrence of the minimum or maximum, the new minimum or maximum will be the next smallest or largest element in the array, respectively. Otherwise, if there are duplicates of the minimum or maximum, removing one occurrence does not change the minimum or maximum values.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can efficiently determine the effect of removing the first (minimum) or last (maximum) elements. Specifically:\n   - **Candidate 1**: Removing the first element (if there are duplicates of the minimum, the new minimum remains the same; otherwise, it becomes the second element). The instability is then calculated as the difference between the last element and the new minimum.\n   - **Candidate 2**: Removing the last element (if there are duplicates of the maximum, the new maximum remains the same; otherwise, it becomes the second last element). The instability is then calculated as the difference between the new maximum and the first element.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves sorting the array and then evaluating the two candidates (removing the first or last element) to determine which removal leads to the smallest instability. The solution efficiently computes these candidates in linear time after sorting, which is optimal for large input sizes.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, and the subsequent steps are O(1) operations. Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    b = sorted(a)\n    \n    candidate1 = float('inf')\n    candidate2 = float('inf')\n    \n    if n >= 2:\n        if b[0] == b[1]:\n            candidate1 = b[-1] - b[0]\n        else:\n            candidate1 = b[-1] - b[1]\n            \n        if b[-1] == b[-2]:\n            candidate2 = b[-1] - b[0]\n        else:\n            candidate2 = b[-2] - b[0]\n            \n    ans = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum elements.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**:\n   - **Candidate 1**: Checks if the first two elements are the same (indicating duplicates of the minimum). If true, removing one minimum leaves the minimum unchanged, so the instability remains the difference between the last element and the first. Otherwise, the new minimum is the second element, and the instability is the difference between the last element and this new minimum.\n   - **Candidate 2**: Similarly checks if the last two elements are the same (indicating duplicates of the maximum). If true, removing one maximum leaves the maximum unchanged, so the instability remains the difference between the first element and the last. Otherwise, the new maximum is the second last element, and the instability is the difference between this new maximum and the first element.\n4. **Result**: The minimum value between the two candidates is printed, representing the smallest possible instability achievable by removing one element from the array. This approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only two critical scenarios, leveraging sorting for optimal performance.",
