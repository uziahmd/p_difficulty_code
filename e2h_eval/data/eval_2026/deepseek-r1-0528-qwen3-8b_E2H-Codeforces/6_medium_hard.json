Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x, then n lines of (li, ri, costi)\n Conditions: \n   - We need two distinct vouchers i and j such that:\n        (ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1) = x   [total duration is x]\n   - The two vouchers do not intersect: meaning either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\n Steps:\n\n Observation: The total duration condition is (duration_i + duration_j = x). So if we let d_i = ri - li + 1, then we require d_i + d_j = x.\n\n Also, the two vouchers must be disjoint. This means that one voucher must end before the other starts.\n\n Approach:\n\n 1. Precompute the duration for each voucher.\n 2. We are going to group the vouchers by their duration. For a given duration d, we want to consider all vouchers with that duration and also keep track of their intervals (li, ri) so that we can check non-overlapping condition.\n\n However, note: we have two conditions for non-overlapping: \n      Condition 1: voucher i ends before voucher j starts -> ri < lj\n      Condition 2: voucher j ends before voucher i starts -> rj < li\n\n But note: since the total duration is fixed (d_i + d_j = x), we can let d_i = d, then d_j = x - d.\n\n Then, for a voucher i with duration d and interval [l1, r1] (so r1 = l1 + d - 1), we need a voucher j with duration x-d and interval [l2, r2] (so r2 = l2 + (x-d) - 1) such that either:\n      r1 < l2   OR   r2 < l1.\n\n Alternatively, we can break the problem into two cases:\n\n Case 1: The first voucher ends before the second starts (voucher i: [l1, r1], voucher j: [l2, r2])\n        Condition: r1 < l2.\n\n Case 2: The second voucher ends before the first starts (voucher i: [l1, r1], voucher j: [l2, r2])\n        Condition: r2 < l1.\n\n But note: in the second case, we are effectively swapping the order? Actually, the condition is symmetric. However, we cannot simply swap because the durations are different (unless d = (x-d) i.e., x is even and d = x/2, then we might have two vouchers of the same duration, but then we must ensure they don't overlap).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"exactly two\" and they are distinct. And the condition is that they don't intersect. So we can consider two orders.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n  Let's define:\n    For a voucher with duration d, we store the left endpoints and the right endpoints.\n\n  But note: the condition for disjointness is that the two intervals do not overlap. The condition is: [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] are disjoint if r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1.\n\n  How to efficiently find the minimal cost?\n\n  We can:\n\n  Step 1: Group vouchers by duration. Let's create a dictionary:\n        groups = defaultdict(list_of_vouchers)\n    Each list_of_vouchers for duration d will contain tuples (l, r, cost) for all vouchers with that duration.\n\n  But note: the condition on duration: we need pairs (d, x-d). So we can iterate over the keys d in the dictionary such that d <= x-d (to avoid duplicates, unless d == x-d then we use the same key twice).\n\n  Step 2: For a fixed pair (d, x-d):\n\n        Let A = list of vouchers with duration d (each represented by (l, r, cost))\n        Let B = list of vouchers with duration x-d (each represented by (l, r, cost))\n\n        Then we want to choose one voucher from A and one from B such that the two intervals are disjoint and the sum of costs is minimized.\n\n        There are two disjoint conditions:\n\n          Condition 1: For a voucher a = (l1, r1, cost1) from A and b = (l2, r2, cost2) from B: r1 < l2.\n          Condition 2: For the same a and b: r2 < l1.\n\n        However, note: if we fix the order of the vouchers (say we assume that the first voucher is from A and the second from B), then condition 1 is r1 < l2. Condition 2 would require that the second voucher ends before the first starts, i.e., r2 < l1. But then we are considering two different orders.\n\n        But wait: the problem does not specify which voucher comes first. We just require two distinct vouchers that don't intersect. So we can consider both orders.\n\n        However, note: the condition \"don't intersect\" is symmetric. But the durations are fixed: one must be d and the other x-d. So we can fix:\n\n          Option 1: Use a voucher from A (duration d) and a voucher from B (duration x-d) and check condition 1: A's end < B's start.\n          Option 2: Use a voucher from B (duration x-d) and a voucher from A (duration d) and check condition 2: B's end < A's start.\n\n        But note: condition 1 and condition 2 are two different ways of being disjoint. However, if we consider the two sets separately, we can handle both.\n\n        Actually, we can combine the two conditions by noting:\n\n          In condition 1: we require that the entire A voucher is before the B voucher: so the latest day of A (r1) is less than the earliest day of B (l2).\n          In condition 2: the entire B voucher is before the A voucher: the latest day of B (r2) is less than the earliest day of A (l1).\n\n        However, note: the condition is at least one of the two: so we can have two separate cases.\n\n        But wait: what if the two vouchers are not entirely one before the other? Actually, the condition is: two intervals [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] are disjoint if and only if r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider two possibilities:\n\n          Possibility 1: A is entirely before B (r1 < l2)\n          Possibility 2: B is entirely before A (r2 < l1)\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require the two vouchers to be taken in any particular order. But the condition is symmetric.\n\n        How to check these conditions without iterating over every pair (which would be too slow)?\n\n  We can preprocess the lists for A and B:\n\n    For possibility 1 (A before B):\n        We want to minimize cost1 + cost2, subject to r1 < l2.\n\n        We can sort the list A by r1 (the end date) and the list B by l2 (the start date). Then for each voucher a in A, we want to find the voucher in B with the smallest cost such that l2 > r1.\n\n        Similarly, for possibility 2 (B before A):\n        Sort list A by l1 (the start date) and list B by r2 (the end date). Then for each voucher b in B, we want to find the voucher in A with the smallest cost such that l1 > r2.\n\n        However, note: the condition for possibility 2 is r2 < l1, so we can also say that the entire B is before the entire A.\n\n        Alternatively, we can reverse the roles for possibility 2: we can consider the same as possibility 1 but with A and B swapped.\n\n        But note: in possibility 2, we are using B first and then A, but the condition is about B being entirely before A. So we can think:\n\n          Condition 2: r2 < l1  <=> the entire B is before A.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          For possibility 1 (A before B): \n            Sort A by r (increasing) and B by l (increasing). Then we can use two pointers or binary search to find the B's that have l > r1.\n\n          Similarly, for possibility 2 (B before A):\n            Sort B by r (increasing) and A by l (increasing). Then for each B, we look for an A with l > r_B.\n\n        Actually, we can handle both possibilities in a symmetric way.\n\n        However, note: the two possibilities are independent. We must consider both.\n\n        Steps for possibility 1 (A before B):\n\n          Let A_list = list of (r, cost, l) for vouchers in A (duration d). We are going to sort by r (the end of A).\n          Let B_list = list of (l, cost, r) for vouchers in B (duration x-d). We are going to sort by l (the start of B).\n\n          Then, we want for each voucher a in A_list (with end time r1) to consider all vouchers in B_list with l > r1.\n\n          We can precompute for B_list: sort by l, and then create a structure that allows us to quickly query the minimum cost for any voucher in B_list with l >= some value (and also we need the minimal cost overall, but note: there might be multiple with the same l, so we want the minimum cost for all vouchers with l >= L).\n\n          Similarly, for possibility 2 (B before A):\n\n          Let B_list = list of (r, cost, l) for vouchers in B (duration x-d). Sort by r.\n          Let A_list = list of (l, cost, r) for vouchers in A (duration d). Sort by l.\n\n          Then for each voucher b in B_list (with end time r2) we require an A with l > r2.\n\n        But note: we are storing the same data in two different ways.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          For possibility 1 (A before B):\n            Sort A by r (end of A) and then for each a in A, we want to consider B's that have l > a.r. Then we can also sort B by l and then use a Fenwick tree or segment tree? Or we can do a two-pointer and then use a segment tree for the B_list.\n\n        However, note the constraints: n up to 200,000, and the days (l, r) up to 200,000. We can use coordinate compression and a Fenwick tree or segment tree for the B_list for possibility 1.\n\n        But wait: we are going to do this for every distinct d? The total distinct d might be up to 200,000? Actually, the duration d is between 1 and 200,000 (since l, r in [1, 200000]), and the total n is 200000. So the distinct d values might be up to 200000.\n\n        But note: we only consider d such that d <= x-d (to avoid duplicate pairs). Also, d and x-d must be in the dictionary.\n\n        However, the worst-case total number of distinct d is 200000, and we cannot iterate over each distinct d and do an O(n log n) operation because then the total complexity would be O(n^2 log n) which is too high.\n\n        We must reorganize.\n\n  Let me change perspective:\n\n  Instead of grouping by duration, we can try to use the condition on the durations and the non-overlapping condition to design a solution that runs in O(n log n) or similar.\n\n  Alternate Insight:\n\n  We note that the total duration condition is fixed: d_i + d_j = x.\n\n  We can also note that the two vouchers must be disjoint. \n\n  What if we consider the following:\n\n    We are going to iterate over the possible durations d from 1 to x//2 (if x is even, then d from 1 to floor(x/2); if d = x-d, then we are in the case of two vouchers of the same duration, and we must take two distinct ones).\n\n    But then, for each d, we have two sets: set_d (vouchers with duration d) and set_{x-d} (vouchers with duration x-d). Then we want to find the minimal cost pair (a, b) such that either a is from set_d and b from set_{x-d} and they are disjoint.\n\n    How to quickly get the minimal cost pair for the disjoint condition?\n\n    We can precompute for each set (for each distinct duration) two structures:\n\n        Structure 1: For a set S (with duration d) we want to answer: given an end date E (from the other voucher, say from set_{x-d}), find the minimal cost voucher in S that starts after E (or has start > E) for the condition that the other voucher ends before this one starts (condition 2: entire set_{x-d} voucher is before set_d voucher).\n\n        Structure 2: Similarly, for the condition that the set_d voucher is entirely before set_{x-d}: we want to find the minimal cost voucher in set_{x-d} that starts after the end of the current set_d voucher.\n\n    Actually, we can break the problem into two independent parts for each pair (d, x-d):\n\n        Part 1: Condition: the set_d voucher ends before the set_{x-d} voucher starts.\n            For a voucher a in set_d (with end = r_a), we need a voucher b in set_{x-d} with start >= r_a+1 (or > r_a). Then we want the minimal cost for such a b.\n\n        Part 2: Condition: the set_{x-d} voucher ends before the set_d voucher starts.\n            For a voucher b in set_{x-d} (with end = r_b), we need a voucher a in set_d with start >= r_b+1.\n\n    So we can precompute:\n\n        For each distinct duration, we build two structures:\n\n          Structure A (for the set with duration d) for the condition that we want to query by the end date of the other voucher (from set_{x-d}) and get the minimal cost voucher in set_d that starts after that end date.\n\n          Similarly, structure B (for the set with duration d) for the condition that we want to query by the end date of the other voucher (from set_{x-d}) and get the minimal cost voucher in set_d that has start after that end date? Actually, wait:\n\n        Actually, for Part 1: \n            We have set_d and set_{x-d}. We want for each a in set_d (with end = r_a) to find the minimal cost in set_{x-d} with start > r_a.\n\n        For Part 2:\n            We have set_{x-d} and set_d. We want for each b in set_{x-d} (with end = r_b) to find the minimal cost in set_d with start > r_b.\n\n        Notice: Part 1 and Part 2 are symmetric, but the sets are different.\n\n        We can precompute for each distinct duration d, two sorted lists (by the start and by the end) and then use binary search and a segment tree or a Fenwick tree for the minimal cost.\n\n        However, the total distinct durations might be up to 200000, and we cannot build a Fenwick tree for each distinct duration (that would be too heavy).\n\n  Another idea:\n\n    Instead, we can precompute two global structures:\n\n        Structure 1: For all vouchers, we index by the duration. Then for each duration d, we store:\n            - All the vouchers with duration d, sorted by their start (or end) and then by cost.\n\n        But then, when we consider a pair (d, x-d), we want to combine the two sets.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d, two arrays:\n\n            starts[d]: sorted list of starts (or the entire tuple (start, end, cost)) for vouchers with duration d, sorted by start (for condition 2: we need to find a voucher in set_{x-d} that starts after a given end date, so we can also store by end and then use condition on start).\n\n        But note: condition 1 (set_d ends before set_{x-d} starts) depends on the end of set_d and the start of set_{x-d}. Condition 2 (set_{x-d} ends before set_d starts) depends on the end of set_{x-d} and the start of set_d.\n\n        We can precompute for each duration d:\n\n            list_d = sorted([ (l, r, cost) for each voucher ], key=lambda x: x[0])   # by start\n            list_d_by_end = sorted([ (l, r, cost) for each voucher ], key=lambda x: x[1])   # by end\n\n        Then, for a fixed pair (d, x-d):\n\n            For condition 1: \n                We have set_d and set_{x-d}. We want for each voucher in set_d (with end = r) to find the minimal cost in set_{x-d} that has start > r.\n\n                We can precompute for set_{x-d} (duration = x-d) a sorted list by start, and then for each voucher in set_d, we do a binary search in set_{x-d}'s start list for the first start > r, and then we can have a segment tree / Fenwick tree for set_{x-d} by start to get the minimal cost among those with start > r.\n\n            Similarly, for condition 2: \n                We want for each voucher in set_{x-d} (with end = r') to find the minimal cost in set_d (duration d) that has start > r'.\n\n        However, building a Fenwick tree for each distinct duration is too expensive (both in memory and time) because the total distinct durations can be 200000, and the total number of vouchers is 200000.\n\n  We need a better approach.\n\n  Let me think differently:\n\n    We note that the condition for non-overlapping is that the two intervals do not overlap. The condition is equivalent to: the first voucher must end before the second starts OR the second ends before the first starts.\n\n    We can also consider the entire set of vouchers and then use two pointers or dynamic programming.\n\n  Another idea: instead of grouping by duration, we can try to iterate over the vouchers and use a dictionary that maps duration to a list of (start, end, cost). Then, for each voucher, we know that we need a voucher with duration = x - (end-start+1) and then check non-overlapping.\n\n    But then, how to quickly find the minimal cost for a given duration and satisfying the non-overlapping condition?\n\n    We can precompute for each duration d (from 1 to 200000) the best (minimal cost) voucher for a given start range? \n\n    However, note: the non-overlapping condition depends on the specific start/end.\n\n    We can try to fix the first voucher and then look for the second.\n\n    Steps:\n\n      Let total_duration = x.\n\n      For each voucher i (with duration d_i = r_i-l_i+1), we need a voucher j with duration d_j = x - d_i.\n\n      Then, the condition is either:\n          r_i < l_j   OR   r_j < l_i.\n\n      We can precompute two dictionaries:\n\n        dict1: keyed by duration d, then for each d, we store a list of (l, r, cost) for all vouchers with that duration.\n\n      Then, for each voucher i, we look for a voucher j in dict1[x-d_i] that satisfies either condition.\n\n      Then, we want the minimal cost.\n\n      But how to do that without iterating over all vouchers in the other set?\n\n      We can precompute for each duration d, two sorted lists:\n\n        By start: and then by cost? Or by end and then by cost?\n\n      Specifically, for condition 1 (r_i < l_j): we need a voucher j in set_d (where d = x-d_i) with l_j > r_i. Then we want the minimal cost in set_d for any voucher with l_j > r_i.\n\n      Similarly, for condition 2 (r_j < l_i): we need a voucher j in set_d with r_j < l_i. Then we want the minimal cost in set_d for any voucher with r_j < l_i.\n\n      Then, for each voucher i, we can do:\n\n        d_other = x - d_i\n        if d_other in dict1:\n            candidate1 = minimal cost in set_d_other for any voucher with l > r_i   (condition 1)\n            candidate2 = minimal cost in set_d_other for any voucher with r < l_i   (condition 2)\n\n            Then, if candidate1 or candidate2 exists, update the answer with min(candidate1, candidate2) [if both exist, take the minimum]\n\n      Then, we need to precompute for each duration d:\n\n        We store:\n            starts[d] = sorted list of (l, cost) for vouchers with duration d, but we also need the end (r) because we need to check the condition? Actually, no: the condition only uses the start or the end.\n\n        Actually, for condition 1, we only need the start of the voucher j (must be > r_i). And for condition 2, we only need the end of the voucher j (must be < l_i).\n\n        So we can store:\n\n            For duration d, we can have two separate structures:\n\n                structure_start[d]: for the start condition (we want to query by a threshold on start: we want the minimal cost among all vouchers with start > threshold). We can use a segment tree or a Fenwick tree, but note: we are going to do many queries (n * (number of distinct durations) might be too many). \n\n            Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d:\n\n                Let list_start = sorted([(l, cost) for each voucher in set_d], key=l)\n                Then, we can create an array for the starts and an array for the minimal cost for each start index and beyond.\n\n                Similarly, for condition 2: \n                    Let list_end = sorted([(r, cost) for each voucher in set_d], key=r)   # but note: the condition is on the end being < l_i, so we want minimal cost for vouchers with end < l_i.\n\n            However, note: we are going to do a lot of queries (n up to 200000) for each distinct duration. The total distinct durations might be up to 200000, but note that the sum of the sizes of all sets is n (200000). But we are iterating over each voucher (n=200000) and for each we do two queries (one for condition1 and one for condition2) on two different durations (d_i and d_other). \n\n            But note: the same duration d might be queried multiple times (for each voucher i with duration d_i, we query d_other = x-d_i). And the same duration d is used for multiple queries.\n\n            We can precompute for each distinct duration d (that appears) two arrays:\n\n                For condition1 (query by start threshold T): \n                    We want the minimal cost among all vouchers in set_d with start >= T+1 (or > T). \n\n                    We can precompute an array for set_d (for condition1) by sorting by start, and then create an array min_cost_from_index[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end (in the sorted list by start). Then, we can do a binary search to find the first index where start > T, and then use min_cost_from_index[i].\n\n                Similarly, for condition2 (query by end threshold T): \n                    We want the minimal cost among all vouchers in set_d with end < T (i.e., r < T).\n\n                    We can sort the set_d by end, and then create an array min_cost_from_beginning[i] = minimum cost from 0 to i (in the sorted-by-end list). Then, we can find the last index where end < T and then use min_cost_from_beginning[i].\n\n            Steps for a fixed duration d:\n\n                Step 1: Collect all vouchers with duration d: list1 = [(l, cost, r)]  (but we don't need r for condition1, but we do need to know the duration to compute the condition1 query? Actually, condition1 doesn't require r from the set_d, it requires the start of the voucher in set_d. However, we stored the start and the cost.)\n\n                Step 2: For condition1 (query by a threshold T, which is the end of the other voucher) for set_d:\n                    We are going to query: find the minimal cost in set_d for which l > T.\n\n                    We can do:\n                        sorted_by_start = sorted([(l, cost) for (l,_,cost) in list1], key=l)\n                        Then, we create an array for the starts and an array min_cost_after[i] for i from 0 to len(sorted_by_start)-1.\n\n                    Then, for a query T, we find the smallest index i such that sorted_by_start[i][0] > T. Then the minimal cost from i to the end is min_cost_after[i].\n\n                Step 3: For condition2 (query by a threshold T, which is the start of the other voucher) for set_d:\n                    We are going to query: find the minimal cost in set_d for which r < T.\n\n                    We can do:\n                        sorted_by_end = sorted([(r, cost) for (l,_,cost) in list1], key=r)\n                        Then, we create an array min_cost_before[i] for i from 0 to len(sorted_by_end)-1.\n\n                    Then, for a query T, we find the largest index i such that sorted_by_end[i][0] < T, and then the minimal cost from 0 to i is min_cost_before[i].\n\n            However, note: the condition1 and condition2 queries are independent.\n\n            But the problem: the total distinct durations is D (at most 200000). And the total number of vouchers is n (200000). The worst-case is that we have many distinct durations, then each set_d is small. But then the total work to build the structures for all distinct durations is O(n) because the sum of the sizes of all sets is n.\n\n            But then, when we iterate over each voucher (n=200000) and do two queries (each query O(log(size(set_d_other)))), the total work is O(n * log(n)).\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Precomputation:\n\n                  Read input.\n                  Let n, x = map(int, line.split())\n                  vouchers = []\n                  for i in range(n):\n                      l, r, cost = map(int, line.split())\n                      d = r - l + 1\n                      vouchers.append((l, r, cost, d))\n\n                  # Build dictionary: key = duration, value = list of (l, cost) [we don't need r for condition1, but for condition2 we do? Actually, condition1 uses the start of the voucher from set_d_other, condition2 uses the end of the voucher from set_d_other? Wait, no:\n\n                  Actually, condition1 for a voucher i (duration d_i) and set_d_other (duration d_other) uses the start of the voucher j (from set_d_other) to compare with the end of voucher i (r_i). \n\n                  But wait: in condition1, we require that the voucher j (from set_d_other) has start > r_i. So we don't need the end of voucher j for condition1. Similarly, condition2: we require the voucher j (from set_d_other) has end < l_i. So we do need the end of voucher j for condition2.\n\n                  Therefore, for each set_d (duration d), we need to store two things:\n\n                    For condition1 (when set_d is the other set): we need the start of the voucher (for comparing against the end of the first voucher) and the cost.\n\n                    For condition2 (when set_d is the other set): we need the end of the voucher and the cost.\n\n                  However, note: condition1 is applied when set_d is the other set (so we are looking at set_d_other = set_d) and the first voucher is from set_d_i. Condition1: the other voucher (set_d_other) must have start > r_i. So we store for set_d: the start and the cost.\n\n                  Condition2: the other voucher (set_d_other) must have end < l_i. So we store for set_d: the end and the cost.\n\n                  But wait: the same voucher j has both a start and an end. So we can store two separate structures for each set_d:\n\n                    structure1: for condition1 (query by a threshold T (which is an end date) and we want the minimal cost voucher in set_d with start > T.\n\n                    structure2: for condition2 (query by a threshold T (which is a start date) and we want the minimal cost voucher in set_d with end < T.\n\n                  Then, for a voucher i (with duration d_i, start l_i, end r_i, cost cost_i):\n\n                    Condition1: look in set_d_other (where d_other = x - d_i) for the minimal cost voucher with start > r_i.\n\n                    Condition2: look in set_d_other for the minimal cost voucher with end < l_i.\n\n                  Then, the total cost for the pair would be cost_i + (minimal cost found in condition1 or condition2).\n\n                  Then, we want the minimal total cost over all vouchers i and the two conditions.\n\n            Implementation:\n\n              Step 1: Precompute the dictionary for durations.\n\n                  Let dict_duration = {}\n                  For each voucher (l, r, cost, d) (d = r-l+1):\n                      if d not in dict_duration:\n                          dict_duration[d] = []\n                      dict_duration[d].append( (l, r, cost) )   # we need both l and r for condition2\n\n              Step 2: For each distinct duration d, we build two structures:\n\n                  Structure1 (for condition1): \n                    We want to support queries: given T (end date), find the minimal cost among vouchers with start > T.\n\n                    We can do:\n                      list1 = [ (l, cost) for (l, r, cost) in dict_duration[d] ]\n                      Sort list1 by l (start).\n                      Then, we want to ignore the r for condition1? Actually, condition1 doesn't use r, so we can just use (l, cost).\n\n                  Structure2 (for condition2):\n                    We want to support queries: given T (start date of the first voucher), find the minimal cost among vouchers with end < T.\n\n                    list2 = [ (r, cost) for (l, r, cost) in dict_duration[d] ]\n                    Sort list2 by r (end).\n\n              Step 3: Precompute for each distinct duration d:\n\n                  For structure1 (condition1 for set_d):\n                    Sort list1 by l (start) -> sorted_by_l = sorted(list1, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                    Then, create an array min_cost_arr1 = [0]*len(sorted_by_l)\n                    Traverse from the last element to the first: \n                        min_cost_arr1[i] = min(cost for the current and the rest) \n                    Then, for a query T, we find the first index i such that sorted_by_l[i][0] > T (using bisect_right or bisect_left). Then the minimal cost is min_cost_arr1[i] if i < len(sorted_by_l), else infinity.\n\n                  Similarly, for structure2 (condition2 for set_d):\n                    Sort list2 by r (end) -> sorted_by_r = sorted(list2, key=lambda x: x[0])\n                    Then, create an array min_cost_arr2 = [0]*len(sorted_by_r)\n                    Traverse from the first element to the last: \n                        min_cost_arr2[i] = min(cost for elements from 0 to i)   [but we want the minimal cost for any voucher with end <= sorted_by_r[i][0]? Actually, we want the minimal cost for any voucher with end < T, so we can do:\n\n                    Actually, we want for a query T: the minimal cost among vouchers with r < T.\n\n                    We can do:\n                      sorted_by_r = sorted(list2)  # by r\n                      min_cost_so_far = a big number\n                      min_cost_arr2 = [0]*len(sorted_by_r)\n                      for idx in range(len(sorted_by_r)):\n                          if idx==0:\n                              min_cost_arr2[idx] = sorted_by_r[idx][1]\n                          else:\n                              min_cost_arr2[idx] = min(min_cost_arr2[idx-1], sorted_by_r[idx][1])\n\n                    But note: we want to query by T (threshold for r: must be < T). We can find the last index j such that sorted_by_r[j][0] < T, then the minimal cost is min_cost_arr2[j].\n\n              Step 4: Iterate over each voucher i (l, r, cost, d_i) and:\n\n                    d_other = x - d_i\n                    If d_other in dict_duration:\n\n                      Condition1: Query set_d_other (which is the structure1 for d_other) with T = r (the end of voucher i). \n                          We need the minimal cost in set_d_other for a voucher with start > r.\n\n                      Condition2: Query set_d_other (structure2 for d_other) with T = l (the start of voucher i). \n                          We need the minimal cost in set_d_other for a voucher with end < l.\n\n                    Then, candidate = min(condition1_result, condition2_result)   [if one is not available, use the available one]\n\n                    Then, the total cost for the pair is cost_i + candidate.\n\n                    Then update the global answer.\n\n              However, note: the two conditions are independent and we are allowed to use either. But note: the same voucher j cannot be used twice. But our structures are built from the entire set_d_other, and we are not enforcing distinctness? Actually, the problem requires two distinct vouchers. But note: we are querying set_d_other (which may include the same voucher i if by chance the duration matches and the dates match? But voucher i has duration d_i, and set_d_other has duration d_other (which is x-d_i). Unless d_i == d_other, then we are querying set_d_other which includes the same set of vouchers. Then, we must ensure that we don't pick the same voucher.\n\n              But note: the problem says \"exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j)\". \n\n              How to avoid self-pairing?\n\n              When d_i == d_other (i.e., x is even and d_i = x/2), then the set_d_other is the same set. Then, we must not pick the same voucher.\n\n              However, our query for condition1 and condition2 in set_d_other (which is the same set) might return the same voucher i? \n\n              Condition1: We require a voucher j in set_d_other (same set) such that j's start > r_i. But voucher i has start l_i and end r_i. Since the voucher i has duration d_i, we have r_i = l_i + d_i - 1. Now, if there is another voucher j (distinct from i) in the same set that satisfies the condition, then it's okay. But if the only voucher in set_d_other is voucher i itself, then we cannot use it.\n\n              However, we built set_d_other from all vouchers with duration d_other. So if d_i = d_other, then set_d_other includes all vouchers with duration d_i. Then, we must exclude voucher i from the set when querying.\n\n              But wait: we did not remove voucher i from set_d_other. Therefore, we might accidentally use voucher i again.\n\n              How to handle this?\n\n              We can do:\n\n                When d_i == d_other, we must not consider voucher i itself in the set_d_other.\n\n              But then, we cannot build a static structure for set_d_other.\n\n              Alternative: we can do two passes: one where we precompute the entire set_d_other, and then for each voucher i, we remove its own contribution? But then the query structure must be dynamic.\n\n              Or, we can store for each set_d two structures: one including all and one excluding the current voucher? That is too heavy.\n\n  Revised plan for the case d_i == d_other:\n\n    We can process the pairs (d, x-d) only once (for d <= x-d) and then for d == x-d, we have to consider unordered pairs (i, j) with i != j.\n\n    But note: the problem does not require ordered pairs, so we can consider each unordered pair once.\n\n    However, the original plan was to iterate over each voucher i and then look for a voucher j (in set_d_other). Then, if d_i == d_other, we are including the same set.\n\n    We can do:\n\n      Precompute for each duration d (including the case d == x-d) two structures (structure1 and structure2) for the entire set.\n\n      Then, for a voucher i with duration d_i:\n\n        If d_i != x-d_i:\n            d_other = x - d_i\n            candidate1 = query_structure1(d_other, r_i)   # condition1: other voucher must have start > r_i\n            candidate2 = query_structure2(d_other, l_i)   # condition2: other voucher must have end < l_i\n            candidate = min(candidate1, candidate2) if both exist, else the existing one or infinity\n\n            total = cost_i + candidate\n            update answer.\n\n        If d_i == x-d_i:\n            Then we must consider two different vouchers from the same set.\n\n            Condition1: we need a voucher j (different from i) in set_d_other (which",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires selecting two non-overlapping vouchers where the sum of their durations is exactly `x`. Each voucher is characterized by its start day, end day, and cost. The key insight is to efficiently check for pairs of vouchers that meet the duration and non-overlapping conditions without resorting to a brute-force approach, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each voucher, we can determine the required duration of the complementary voucher (i.e., `x - duration_of_current_voucher`). We then need to find a voucher with this complementary duration that does not overlap with the current voucher. The non-overlapping condition can be either the current voucher ends before the complementary starts or vice versa.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Preprocessing**: Group all vouchers by their duration. For each duration, prepare two structures:\n     - **Structure 1**: Sorted by start day, allowing efficient queries for the minimal cost voucher starting after a given day.\n     - **Structure 2**: Sorted by end day, allowing efficient queries for the minimal cost voucher ending before a given day.\n   - **Query Processing**: For each voucher, use the precomputed structures to find the minimal cost complementary voucher that meets the non-overlapping condition. The total cost is the sum of the current voucher's cost and the minimal cost found.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting operations and binary searches during query processing, where `n` is the number of vouchers.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the voucher data and auxiliary structures.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom bisect import bisect_right, bisect_left\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    it = iter(data)\n    n = int(next(it)); x = int(next(it))\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(next(it)); r = int(next(it)); cost_val = int(next(it))\n        d = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost_val, d))\n    \n    dict_duration = {}\n    for l, r, cost_val, d in vouchers:\n        if d not in dict_duration:\n            dict_duration[d] = []\n        dict_duration[d].append((l, r, cost_val))\n    \n    structure1_dict = {}  # key: duration -> sorted list of (start, cost) and prefix min array for condition2?

The non-overlapping conditions are checked using the precomputed structures, and the minimal cost is updated accordingly.\n5. **Output**: The minimal total cost is printed if valid pairs are found; otherwise, `-1` is printed indicating no solution exists.",
