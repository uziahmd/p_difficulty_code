При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a string `t` and we need to check if it can be formed by two copies of some string `s` with an overlap (at least one character, and less than the length of `s`). Also note: if the entire string is just two copies without any overlap, that's not considered an error.\n\n Conditions for the problem:\n 1. The message t must be the result of two consecutive transmissions of the same message s, but with a possible overlap (which is at least 1 and less than the length of s). \n 2. We cannot have two copies without any overlap (so if t = s+s, that is not considered an error).\n\n However, note that the example says:\n   Input: \"abcabc\" -> Output: \"NO\"\n\n But wait: if we let s = \"abc\", then t = s+s is not allowed. However, what if there is an overlap? Actually, the problem states that the error occurs when two identical messages are sent in a row and they get merged. So the resulting string should be the first part of the first message and then the second message starting after the overlap.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let n = len(t)\n\n We are looking for a string s such that:\n   There exists an integer k (overlap length) with 1 <= k < len(s) and:\n        t = s[0: len(s)-k] + s\n\n But note: the entire string t is built from two copies of s. In fact, the two copies are s and s, and they are overlapped by k characters. Then the total length of t is: |s| + |s| - k = 2*|s| - k.\n\n Also note: the first |s| - k characters of t must equal the first |s| - k characters of s (the beginning of the first copy) and then the next k characters must match the first k of s (the overlapped part). Then the rest of the second copy (from index |s|-k to |s|+|s|-k-1, i.e., the whole second copy except the overlapping part) must also match.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   Let s be a string and let t be the concatenation of s and s, but with the last k characters of the first s being overlapped (and matching the first k of the second s). Then t has length 2*|s| - k.\n\n Conditions for t:\n   Let n = len(t). Then n must be at least 2 and the string t must be such that there exists an integer m (length of s) and an integer k (overlap) with:\n        m >= 2 (since k>=1 and k<m, so m must be at least 2)\n        and n = 2*m - k, so k = 2*m - n, which must be positive and less than m.\n\n Therefore, we can iterate over possible lengths of s.\n\n Since the total length of t is at most 100, we can consider:\n\n   Let m be the length of s. Then m must satisfy: \n        n = 2*m - k, and k = 2*m - n must be in [1, m-1].\n\n   So: 1 <= 2*m - n <= m-1  => \n        2*m - n >= 1  => m >= (n+1)/2\n        2*m - n <= m-1 => m <= n+1\n\n   Also, note that n must be less than 2*m (because k>=1, so n=2*m-k <= 2*m-1). \n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate over m from ceil((n+1)/2) to floor((n+1)) (but note: m must be at least 2, and also n must be even or odd accordingly).\n\n Another approach: \n   We know that t must be such that there exists a split at some position i (where i is the length of the first s, then the second s starts and overlaps). But note, the entire t is built by having the first s and then the second s starting from the middle.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following idea:\n\n   Let the entire string t be broken as: t = A + B, where A is the prefix of the first s and B is the suffix of the second s. However, the condition is that the two s are the same, and the overlap is the last k characters of s (which are the first k of the next s).\n\n   We can also note: the string t must be periodic with period m, but with the condition that the last k characters (of the entire t) are the same as the first k of the next s? Actually, we can break t into two parts: the first m characters and the second m characters, but they are overlapped by k. Then the entire t is of length 2*m - k.\n\n   How to check? We can try all possible k that would yield a valid m (i.e., m = (n+k)/2, but k must be an integer and m must be integer). Alternatively, we can iterate over the possible overlap k.\n\n   Note: k must be at least 1 and at most min(m-1, n//2) because the second copy must start at least at position k and the entire second copy must be contained until the end.\n\n   Actually, we can fix the split point: the message t was formed by two copies of s, so the original two copies were s and s. The overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s and the first k characters of the second s.\n\n   Then, the entire string t must satisfy: \n        t[0:2*m - k] = s[0:m] + s[k:]   [but note: the second s is the whole s, but we only take from k to the end? Actually, the entire second s is present, but we have taken the first m-k characters of the second s?]\n\n   Actually, the entire t is built as: \n        t = s + s[k:]   (without the overlapping part, the first s is complete, and the second s starts at k and goes to the end)\n\n   Then the length of t is: m + (m - k) = 2*m - k.\n\n   Conditions: \n        t[0:m] == s   and t[m-k:m] == s[0:k] and t[m-k:] == s[k:]?\n\n   But note: the second s is exactly the whole s. However, we don't know s. We are trying to find s.\n\n   Alternatively, we can assume that the entire string t is built from two copies of s, so:\n\n        Let m be the length of s, then m must be at least 2 and k = 2*m - n (which must be between 1 and m-1).\n\n   Then, we can set s = t[0:m]. Then we require:\n        t[0:m] = s (by definition)\n        Then the rest of the string (from m to the end) must be s[k:], and also the substring from m-k to m must be s[0:k].\n\n   But note: the entire string t is built by taking the first s and then appending s without its first k characters? Actually, no: the entire second s is present, but the overlapping part is already included in the first s. So we have:\n\n        t = s + s[k:]\n\n   But also, the overlapping condition must hold: the last k characters of s must equal the first k characters of the next s (which is the same s). So the condition for the boundary is:\n\n        s[m-k: m] == s[0:k]   [if we consider s as the first m characters, then the last k of s must be the same as the first k of s]\n\n   However, wait: the entire t is s + s[k:]. Then the entire t is:\n\n        t[0:m] = s\n        t[m:] = s[k:]\n\n   And the condition that the two copies are the same and the overlap is k is naturally satisfied because we defined s from the first m characters. But we must also check that the first m characters form a string s such that the last k characters of s (which is s[m-k:]) are equal to the first k characters of s (s[0:k])? Actually, no: the condition is that the two copies are the same, so the second copy is s, and we are writing the second copy without its first k characters? \n\n   Actually, the process: \n        First message: s (length m)\n        Second message: s (length m) but we only send the part after the overlap. So the received string is: s + s[k:]\n\n   Now, the condition for the error is that the two original messages are the same, and the overlap occurred. But note: the problem does not require that the entire second message is stored; we only see the concatenated result.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"two identical messages\" and the error causes the two messages to be merged by overlapping. So the entire second message is present, but the overlapping part is shared. Therefore, the entire t is s (the first copy) and then the second copy without the overlapping part? No, actually the second copy is still present, but the overlapping part is not duplicated. \n\n   Actually, the problem states: \"the two messages are merged by overlapping\", meaning the first message ends and the second begins at the overlapping part. So the entire second message is still there, but we don't duplicate the overlapping part. Therefore, the total length is |s| + |s| - k.\n\n   But then how do we reconstruct s? \n\n   We know that the entire string t is the first copy of s (without any loss) and then the second copy of s without the first k characters. \n\n   Therefore, the entire t is: \n        t = s + s[k:]\n\n   Then, the entire string t must be equal to s (first m characters) and then the rest (last m-k characters) must be s[k:].\n\n   Now, note: the condition for the second part is that the substring from index m to the end (which is m-k characters) must be the substring of s starting at k and of length m-k.\n\n   But also, the entire string t must be consistent: the first m characters is s, and the next m-k characters is s[k:].\n\n   Then, we can say: the entire string t is s + s[k:]. But note: the length of t is m + (m-k) = 2*m - k, so we have n = 2*m - k.\n\n   So for a fixed k (overlap length), m = (n+k)/2 must be an integer. Then we can set s = t[0:m] and then check that the next part (from m to the end) is indeed s[k:].\n\n   However, we don't know k. But note: k must be in the range [1, m-1]. And m = (n+k)/2, so k = 2*m - n. Then m must be chosen such that k is in [1, m-1]. \n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate over possible k from 1 to floor(n/2) (because the second copy must be at least partially present, and the first copy is the whole s, then the second copy starts and we have at least k characters from the second copy, so n>=m+k, but m=(n+k)/2, then n>= (n+k)/2 + k => 2n>=n+k+2k => n>=3k? Not exactly, but note: n = 2*m - k, and m>=k+1, so n>=2*(k+1)-k = k+2, so k<=n-2). \n\n   Steps:\n\n   Since the length of t is at most 100, we can try all k from 1 to n//2 (because the second copy must be at least k characters, so the total length is at least m + k, and m = (n+k)/2, so n = 2*m - k >= 2*k - k + ...? Actually, we can simply:\n\n   For a fixed k (overlap length) in the range [1, n//2] (because the second copy must have at least k characters, so the first copy is m, and the second copy is m, so total length is 2*m - k, and the second copy's part (after the first k) is m-k, so the entire string is m + (m-k) = 2*m-k, and we have n=2*m-k, so m=(n+k)/2 must be integer and at least k+1.\n\n   Then, we can do:\n\n      for k in range(1, n//2+1):\n          if (n+k) % 2 != 0:\n              continue\n          m = (n+k)//2\n          # Check that k < m (because k is the overlap and must be less than the length of s, which is m)\n          if k >= m:\n              continue\n\n          Then, set s = t[0:m]\n          Then, the expected remaining part (from m to the end) is t[m:], which should be s[k:].\n\n          But also, note: the entire second copy is s, so the part from m to the end should be s[k:], and the length is m - k.\n\n          Then, check if t[m:] == s[k:].\n\n   However, there's another way: the entire string t must be built by two copies of s, so the first m characters is s and the next m-k characters is s[k:]. \n\n   But wait: is that the only possibility? \n\n   Actually, the problem says that the two messages are identical. So the entire string t is the first message s and then the second message s, but without duplicating the overlapping part. So the second message is s, and we are only transmitting s without the first k characters? \n\n   This leads to the above.\n\n   But note: the example: \n        Input: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n        Here, t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", n=21.\n        Let k=1: then m=(21+1)//2=11, then s=\"abrakadabra\", and the rest of t is t[11:] = \"brakadabra\", and s[k:] = \"brakadabra\". So that matches.\n\n        Example: \"acacacaca\", n=9. \n            k=1: m=(9+1)//2=5, then s=\"acaca\", then the rest is t[5:] = \"caca\", and s[1:] = \"cacaca\"? Wait, wait: s[1:] is \"cacac\", but we have only 4 characters left. Actually, the length of the rest is 9-5=4, and s[1:] is 4 characters? s[1:] for \"acaca\" is \"acaca\"[1:] = \"cacac\", which is 5 characters. That doesn't match.\n\n        So what's wrong? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: the entire string t is built as s + s[k:]. The length of s is m, and the length of the appended part is m - k. So the total length is m + (m-k) = 2*m - k = 9. With m=5 and k=1, then the appended part is 4 characters, so the rest of the string is 4 characters. But s[k:] is \"cacac\", which is 5 characters, so we cannot compare 4 characters with 5.\n\n        Alternatively, note: the second copy is s, but we are only sending the part from index k to the end. So the entire second copy is s, but the transmission of the second copy starts at the k-th character. Therefore, the entire t is the first s and then the second s without the first k characters.\n\n        Then, the length of the second copy part is m - k, so the total length is m + (m-k) = 2*m - k.\n\n        In our example, if we set m=5 and k=1, then the second part is 5-1=4 characters. But the rest of t (from index 5) is 4 characters: \"caca\". And s[1:] is \"cacac\", which is 5 characters. \n\n        Why are we comparing with s[k:] which is the entire substring from k to the end of s? That is correct, but then we are taking 4 characters from the second copy (the entire second copy is s, but we are missing the first k=1 character). So the second copy that is transmitted is s[1:], but note: the second copy must be the entire s? Actually, the problem says: \"two identical messages\" so the second message is s. But the error merges them, so the second message is transmitted without the overlapping part. Therefore, the received part for the second message is s without the first k characters.\n\n        So the entire t is: s (the first copy) and then s without the first k characters.\n\n        Then, the condition is: \n            t = s + s[k:]\n\n        But then, the length of t is m + (m - k) = 2*m - k.\n\n        And we must have: t[0:m] = s, and t[m:] = s[k:].\n\n        In the example \"acacacaca\": \n            We want to represent it as s + s[k:].\n\n            Let's try k=2: then m=(9+2)//2 = 11//2 -> not integer.\n\n            k=3: m=(9+3)//2=6 -> integer. Then s=t[0:6]=\"acacac\", then s[3:]=\"ac\", and the rest of t is t[6:]=\"aca\", which is not equal to \"ac\".\n\n            k=4: m=(9+4)//2=13//2 -> not integer.\n\n            k=5: m=(9+5)//2=7 -> integer. Then s=t[0:7]=\"acacaca\", then s[5:]==\"a\", and the rest of t is t[7:]=\"ca\", which is not \"a\".\n\n        But the example output says \"YES\\nacaca\", so s=\"acaca\", which has length 5. Then the total length would be 5 + (5 - k) = 10 - k. We have 9, so 10-k=9 -> k=1. Then we have to check with k=1 and m=5: \n            t = \"acacacaca\" (length 9)\n            s = \"acaca\" (length 5)\n            Then the rest of t (from index 5) should be s[1:] = \"cacac\", but the actual rest is \"caca\" (only 4 characters). \n\n        This does not match.\n\n        Alternatively, the example says: \n            Input: 'acacacaca' -> Output: 'YES\\nacaca'\n\n        So there must be an alternative representation.\n\n        Let me reexamine: the problem says \"if the message t is the result of two copies of s with an overlap of k, then t = s + s[k:]\". \n\n        But note: the two copies are s and s. The entire second copy is s, but we are only receiving s[k:] (because the first k characters of the second copy are already included in the first copy). \n\n        However, the example input is \"acacacaca\", and if we take s=\"acaca\", then the two copies are \"acaca\" and \"acaca\". The merge with overlap k=1 would produce:\n\n            First copy: \"acaca\"\n            Second copy: we only send from the second character: \"caca\" (so the entire string becomes \"acaca\" + \"caca\" = \"acacacaca\", which is 9 characters). \n\n        So the formula is: t = s + s[k:]\n\n        But wait, then the length is 5 + (5-1)=9, so that works.\n\n        Then, we must check that the rest of the string (from index 5) is s[k:] (which is \"caca\"). \n\n        However, the condition above was: t[0:m] = s and t[m:] = s[k:]. \n\n        For m=5, k=1: \n            t[0:5] = \"acaca\" -> matches s.\n            t[5:] = \"caca\" -> and s[1:] = \"cacaca\" (from index1 to the end) -> but wait, s[1:] is \"cacaca\", which is 5 characters, but we only have 4. \n\n        So we must adjust: the second part is s[k:] but we are only taking the first (m-k) characters of s[k:] for the rest of t? \n\n        Actually, the entire second copy is s, but we are only receiving the part that is not overlapped. The length of the second copy that is received is m - k. But note: the entire second copy is s, so the part we receive is s[k:] (which is of length m-k). \n\n        Therefore, we require that the substring of s starting at index k and of length m-k is exactly t[m:].\n\n        But note: s[k:] is the entire substring from k to the end, which has length m-k. So we don't need to take a substring of that. \n\n        Then, for s=\"acaca\", k=1, m=5: \n            s[k:] = s[1:] = \"cacaca\" -> but wait, that is 4 characters? Actually, no: s=\"acaca\" (5 characters): \n                s[1:] is from index1 to the end: \"cacac\" (5-1=4 characters? Actually, in Python: \n                    s = \"acaca\" -> indices: 0:a, 1:c, 2:a, 3:c, 4:a -> so s[1:] is \"caca\" (from index1 to the end) which is 4 characters.\n\n        So the condition is: t[m:] = s[k:] and the length of t[m:] is m-k. \n\n        Since the length of s[k:] is m-k (because s has length m, so from index k to the end is m-k characters), then we can simply check:\n\n            t[0:m] == s   (which we set by taking the first m characters of t) and \n            t[m:] == s[k:]\n\n        But note: we don't know s independently. We set s = t[0:m] and then check the rest.\n\n        However, in the example, if we set m=5, then s=t[0:5]=\"acaca\", and then we check t[5:]==\"caca\" and s[1:]==t[0:5][1:]=\"caca\", which matches.\n\n        Why did I think s[1:] was 5 characters? Because I miscounted: \n            s = \"acaca\" has 5 characters, so s[1:] is from index1 to the last (exclusive? no, in Python slicing is [start:end] by default to the end). So yes, s[1:] is \"cacac\" if the string is \"acaca\"? \n\n        Let me write:\n\n            s = \"acaca\"\n            s[0] = 'a'\n            s[1] = 'c'\n            s[2] = 'a'\n            s[3] = 'c'\n            s[4] = 'a'\n\n            Then s[1:] = s[1:5] (because the end index in slicing is exclusive, but when omitted it goes to the end) -> so it is \"c\" + \"a\" + \"c\" + \"a\" -> \"caca\", which is 4 characters.\n\n        So the condition is satisfied.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Let n = len(t)\n        Let found = False\n        For k in range(1, n//2+1):\n            if (n+k) % 2 != 0:\n                continue\n            m = (n+k)//2\n            # Condition: k must be less than m (overlap length less than s length)\n            if k >= m:\n                continue\n\n            # Now, s = t[0:m]\n            s = t[:m]\n            # The rest of the string after m characters is t[m:]\n            rest = t[m:]\n            # The part of s that should be the second copy without the first k characters is s[k:], which has length m-k.\n            if rest == s[k:]:\n                # But note: the problem says that the two copies are the same, so the entire second copy is s, but we only received s[k:]. \n                # However, we must also ensure that the entire string t is built as s + s[k:] and that the second copy is indeed s (so the part we received is the tail of s). \n                # But we don't have to check beyond that because we set s from the first m characters and the rest is the tail of s.\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s)\n                exit(0)   # or break and then return\n\n        If we didn't find any k, then we try the other possibility: maybe the error happened but the two copies are not contiguous in the way we thought? \n\n        However, note: the problem says that the error is when two identical messages are sent and they get merged by overlapping. So the above covers that.\n\n        But wait: what if the entire string t is built by two copies of s, but the first copy is not necessarily the first m characters? \n\n        Actually, the error happens during transmission, so the two copies are consecutive. The first copy is the first part, and the second copy starts immediately after. Therefore, the entire string t is the first copy and then the second copy without the overlapping part.\n\n        However, note: the example \"tatbt\" is given and output is \"NO\". Let's test:\n\n        t = \"tatbt\", n=5.\n\n        k from 1 to 2 (n//2=2)\n\n        k=1: (5+1)%2=0 -> m=3, then s=t[0:3]=\"tat\", rest=t[3:]=\"bt\", and s[1:]=\"at\", which is not \"bt\".\n\n        k=2: (5+2)%2=1 -> skip.\n\n        So no solution -> output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait, what if we consider the entire string t being built by two copies of s, but s might not be the first m characters? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify the order. The two copies are consecutive. So the first copy is at the beginning and the second copy is the rest, but the second copy is merged with the end of the first.\n\n        But note: the entire string t must be the concatenation of the first copy and the second copy without the overlapping part. Therefore, the first copy is the first m characters.\n\n        However, there is another possibility: the error might occur in the middle? Actually, the problem says \"two consecutive messages\", so the entire first message is at the beginning and the entire second message is the rest, but with the overlapping part.\n\n        But wait: the example \"abcabc\" is given as \"NO\". Let's check:\n\n        t=\"abcabc\", n=6.\n\n        k from 1 to 3.\n\n        k=1: m=(6+1)//2 -> 7//2 not integer.\n        k=2: m=(6+2)//2=4 -> integer, and 2<4 -> valid.\n            s = t[0:4]=\"abca\", rest=t[4:]=\"bc\", and s[2:]=\"ca\", which is not \"bc\".\n\n        k=3: m=(6+3)//2=4.5 -> not integer.\n\n        So no solution. But wait, what if we consider k=3 and m= (6+3)//2=4.5 -> invalid.\n\n        Alternatively, note: the example says \"abcabc\" is not an error. \n\n        But wait, there is another representation: if we let s=\"abc\", then the two copies are \"abc\" and \"abc\", and if there is an overlap of 3, then the entire string would be \"abc\" + \"\" (since we remove the first 3 of the second copy) -> \"abc\", but that's not the case. The error requires the overlap to be positive and less than the length of s. Also, the entire string is two copies, so the length should be 2*m - k. For s=\"abc\", m=3, then k must be 1 or 2. \n\n        k=1: then the string would be \"abc\" + \"bc\" = \"abcbc\", which is not \"abcabc\".\n        k=2: then the string would be \"abc\" + \"c\" = \"abcc\", which is not \"abcabc\".\n\n        So \"abcabc\" cannot be represented by two copies of a string s with an overlap. \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"if the entire string is two copies without any overlap, that is not considered an error\". But \"abcabc\" is two copies without any overlap? Actually, no: two copies without any overlap would be s+s, which is \"abcabc\", and that is not an error. But wait, the problem says: \"if the entire string is two copies without any overlap, that is not considered an error\", so we must output \"NO\" for that.\n\n        But our algorithm does output \"NO\" for \"abcabc\", which is correct.\n\n        However, what if there is an alternative representation? Consider a string that can be represented in two different ways? \n\n        Example: \"aaa\", n=3.\n\n        Possibilities:\n          k=1: m=(3+1)//2=2 -> integer, then s=\"aa\", rest=t[2:]=\"\" and s[1:]=\"a\", which is not empty string. -> fails.\n\n          k=1: m=2, then s=\"aa\", rest=\"\" -> we require s[1:]==\"a\" but we have rest=\"\", so no.\n\n        But wait: if we consider s=\"a\", then the two copies are \"a\" and \"a\", and the overlap must be less than 1 (which is not allowed). So no.\n\n        Another example: \"aaaa\", n=4.\n\n        k=1: m=(4+1)//2 -> 5//2=2 (if integer division? but 5%2!=0 -> skip).\n        k=2: m=(4+2)//2=3 -> then s=t[0:3]=\"aaa\", rest=t[3:]=\"a\", and s[2:]=\"a\" -> matches. So output \"YES\\naaa\".\n\n        But wait: is that correct? \n            Two copies of \"aaa\": the first copy is \"aaa\", and the second copy is \"aaa\", and the overlap is 2, so we remove the first 2 characters of the second copy. Then the second copy part is \"a\". \n            Then the entire string is \"aaa\" + \"a\" = \"aaaa\", which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that the two messages are identical. So the two copies are both \"aaa\". Then the error condition applies: the two copies are merged by overlapping the last 2 of the first and the first 2 of the second. \n\n        But wait: the second copy is \"aaa\", so the first two characters of the second copy are \"aa\", and the last two of the first copy are \"aa\". Then the merged string is \"aaa\" (the first copy) and then the last part of the second copy that is not overlapping is the last character \"a\". So the entire string is \"aaa\"+\"a\" = \"aaaa\". \n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"acaca\", which is of length 5, and the entire string is 9, so we used k=1 and m=5.\n\n        However, there might be multiple solutions. The problem says: if there are multiple, output any.\n\n        But wait: what if the string can be represented by two different s? \n\n        Example: \"abab\", n=4.\n\n        Possibilities:\n          k=1: m=(4+1)//2 -> not integer.\n          k=2: m=(4+2)//2=3 -> s=\"aba\", rest=t[3:]=\"b\", and s[2:]=\"a\", which is not \"b\".\n\n        What about s=\"ab\"? Then the two copies are \"ab\" and \"ab\", and if there is an overlap of 1: \n            t = \"ab\" + \"b\" = \"abb\", which is not \"abab\".\n        Overlap of 2: not allowed (must be less than m=2).\n\n        Alternatively, s=\"abab\" (then m=4, then k=2: then the string would be \"abab\" + \"ab\", but wait, the second copy without the first 2 is \"ab\", so the entire string would be \"ababab\", which is 6, not 4.\n\n        Alternatively, consider: the entire string is \"abab\", which is two copies of \"ab\" without any overlap? But the problem says that is not an error, so we output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"if the entire string is two copies without any overlap, that is not considered an error\". So we must not output \"YES\" for two copies without overlap.\n\n        However, note: our method does not consider two copies without overlap because we require k>=1. \n\n        But what if we consider s=\"abab\", then the two copies without overlap would be s+s=\"abababab\", which is not the case.\n\n        Alternatively, is there a representation for \"abab\"?\n\n        Let me try: \n          k=1: m=(4+1)//2 -> 2.5 -> skip.\n          k=2: m=3, s=\"aba\", rest=\"b\", and s[2:]=\"a\" != \"b\".\n\n        k=3: m=(4+3)//2=3.5 -> skip.\n\n        So no solution.\n\n        But wait, what if we consider the entire string t as two copies of s, but the first copy is not the entire first part? \n\n        Actually, the problem states: the two messages are consecutive. So the entire first message is the first m characters and the entire second message is the next m characters, but with the first k characters of the second message being merged with the last k of the first.\n\n        Therefore, the representation is fixed.\n\n        One more example: \"ababa\", n=5.\n\n        k=1: m=(5+1)//2=3 -> s=\"aba\", rest=\"ba\", and s[1:]=\"ba\" -> matches. So output \"YES\\naba\".\n\n        Then the entire string is \"aba\" + \"ba\" (which is s[1:]) -> \"aba\"+\"ba\" = \"ababa\", correct.\n\n        However, note: the two copies are \"aba\" and \"aba\", and the overlap is 1, so the second copy without the first character is \"ba\", which is exactly the rest.\n\n        But wait, is there another representation? \n          k=2: m=(5+2)//2=3.5 -> skip.\n\n        So only one representation.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        For k in range(1, n//2+1):\n            if (n+k) % 2 != 0:\n                continue\n            m = (n+k)//2\n            if k >= m:\n                continue\n            s = t[:m]\n            if t[m:] == s[k:]:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s)\n                return\n\n        After the loop, if no representation found, print \"NO\".\n\n        However, wait: what if the string t can be represented by two copies of s, but the first copy is not the entire first m characters? \n\n        Actually, the error happens during the transmission of two consecutive messages, so the entire first message is at the beginning and the entire second message is the rest, but with the overlapping part. Therefore, the first m characters must be the first copy.\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify that the entire string t is built by two consecutive copies. However, the problem says: \"By transmission of two identical messages\", so the two copies are consecutive.\n\n        Therefore, the above algorithm should work.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the condition we checked is that the rest of the string (t[m:]) equals s[k:]. But note: the entire second copy is s, so the part we receive is s[k:], and that must be the entire rest of the string.\n\n        But what if the string is longer than 2*m - k? Then we are only checking the first m-k characters of the rest? Actually, the length of the rest is n - m, and we require that n - m = m - k, so n = 2*m - k. \n\n        Therefore, we are covering the entire string.\n\n        But wait: we set m = (n+k)//2, so n = 2*m - k, which is the condition. Therefore, the length of the rest is n - m = (2*m - k) - m = m - k, and s[k:] is of length m - k. So we are comparing two strings of the same length.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that the two messages are identical. Our algorithm sets s to be the first m characters, and then the rest is the second copy without the first k characters. But the second copy is supposed to be the same as s. \n\n        We are not explicitly checking that the entire second copy (without the first k) is the same as the part of s starting at k. But that is exactly what we are doing: we set s to the first m characters, and then we check that the rest (which is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlapping part. The overlap must be at least one character and less than the length of `s`. If such a decomposition is possible, we output `YES` followed by the string `s`; otherwise, we output `NO`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by taking the first `m` characters (string `s`) and appending the substring of `s` starting from the `k`-th character (where `k` is the overlap length). The total length of `t` should be `2*m - k`, ensuring that `k` is between 1 and `m-1`.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over all possible overlap lengths `k` from 1 to half the length of `t`. For each `k`, we check if `(n + k)` is even, where `n` is the length of `t`. If it is, we compute `m` as `(n + k) // 2`. We then verify that `k` is less than `m` and that the substring `t[m:]` matches `s[k:]` (where `s` is `t[0:m]`).\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks up to `n/2` values of `k`, each involving string slicing and comparison operations. Given that `n` is at most 100, this approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    found = False\n    for k in range(1, n//2 + 1):\n        if (n + k) % 2 != 0:\n            continue\n        m = (n + k) // 2\n        if k >= m:\n            continue\n        s = t[:m]\n        rest = t[m:]\n        if rest == s[k:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s)\n            return\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Overlaps**: For each possible overlap length `k` from 1 to half the length of `t`, the algorithm checks if `(n + k)` is even. If not, it skips to the next iteration.\n3. **Check Validity of `m`**: The value `m` is calculated as `(n + k) // 2`. If `k` is not less than `m`, the loop continues.\n4. **String Decomposition**: The string `s` is taken as the first `m` characters of `t`. The remaining part of `t` (from position `m` onwards) is compared with `s[k:]`. If they match, the solution is found, and `s` is printed.\n5. **Output Result**: If no valid decomposition is found after all iterations, the algorithm outputs `NO`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could be formed by two overlapping copies of `s`, ensuring correctness while maintaining optimal performance.",
