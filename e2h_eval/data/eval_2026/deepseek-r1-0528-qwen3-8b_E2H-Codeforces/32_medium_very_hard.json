    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering that removing one element might help us avoid either the minimum or the maximum (or both) of the entire array.\n\n Observation:\n The instability of the array is defined as max - min.\n After removing one element, the new array's instability will be (max of remaining) - (min of remaining).\n\n We note that if we remove an element that is not the current min or max, then the min and max of the entire array remain unchanged, so the instability remains the same.\n\n Therefore, the only candidates for removal are:\n   - The global minimum\n   - The global maximum\n\n However, note that there might be multiple occurrences of the min and max. Removing one occurrence might not change the overall min or max if they still exist elsewhere.\n\n But note: we can also consider removing an element that is not the global min or max but which might be part of a subarray that has a lower instability? Actually, wait:\n\n However, the key is that the instability of the entire array is determined by the global min and max. Removing an element that is not the global min or max does not change the global min or max, hence the instability remains the same.\n\n Therefore, the minimal instability must come from one of two cases:\n  Case 1: Remove the smallest element. Then the new min is the next smallest (which could be the same if there are duplicates) and the max remains the same? Actually, no: if there are duplicates, then the min might stay the same even after removing one occurrence of the min.\n\n So let's reframe:\n\n Let the original array be sorted: b[0] <= b[1] <= ... <= b[n-1]\n\n Possibilities:\n  Option 1: Remove an element that is the smallest. Then the new array has min = b[1] (if n>=2) and max = b[n-1]. So instability = b[n-1] - b[1].\n  Option 2: Remove an element that is the largest. Then the new array has min = b[0] and max = b[n-2]. So instability = b[n-2] - b[0].\n\n However, note: what if we remove an element that is in the middle? Then the min and max of the entire array remain the same, so the instability remains (b[n-1]-b[0]). But we are trying to minimize, so we don't want that unless we have no better option.\n\n But wait, what if we remove an element that is neither the smallest nor the largest? Then the min and max of the entire array are still b[0] and b[n-1], so the instability is unchanged.\n\n Therefore, the minimal instability must be the minimum between:\n   candidate1 = b[n-1] - b[1]   [when we remove the first occurrence of the smallest, but note: there might be multiple smallest. Actually, we can remove any one occurrence of the smallest and the new min becomes the next distinct smallest? Not necessarily: if we have [1,1,3,7], then removing one 1: the array becomes [1,3,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability 6. But wait, we want to remove one element. In this case, if we remove one of the 1s, the min remains 1 (because there's another 1). So actually, we must remove an element that is the smallest and then check the new min.\n\n Actually, the above two options (removing the smallest or the largest) are the only ones that can change the min or max. But note: we are allowed to remove exactly one element.\n\n However, consider: what if we remove an element that is the smallest but there are multiple smallest? Then the min doesn't change, and the instability remains the same as the original? Then we cannot get a better result by removing a smallest? Similarly, if we remove a largest and there are multiple largest, the max doesn't change.\n\n Therefore, we must consider:\n\n  candidate1: Remove the smallest element (if there is at least one occurrence of the smallest, then the new min becomes the next smallest distinct value? Actually no: the new min is the smallest value in the remaining array. If we remove one occurrence of the smallest, and there is at least one more smallest, then the min remains the same. So the instability would be (max - min) = (b[n-1] - b[0]) because the min didn't change.\n\n  But wait, we don't know the position of the smallest. Actually, we can do:\n\n  Let m = min(a), M = max(a)\n\n  Then, if we remove an element x, the new min is:\n      if x == m, then the new min is the next smallest number (which is m if there is another m, otherwise the next distinct number)\n      else, the min remains m.\n\n  Similarly, the new max is:\n      if x == M, then the new max is the next largest number (M if there is another M, otherwise the next distinct number)\n      else, the max remains M.\n\n  However, we are trying to minimize the instability, and we are allowed to remove one element.\n\n  We can consider two strategies:\n\n  Strategy 1: Remove one occurrence of the minimum value. Then the new min is:\n        if the frequency of m is > 1, then the new min is still m, so instability = M - m (same as original) \n        else (frequency of m is 1), then the new min is the next distinct value, which is the smallest value greater than m. \n\n  But note: we don't know the entire array, but we can sort the array and then use the sorted array to easily compute the next distinct value.\n\n  Alternatively, we can consider all possibilities by looking at the sorted array.\n\n  Since the array is sorted, we can consider:\n\n  Possibility 1: Remove the first element (the smallest). Then the new instability is (last element - second element) = b[n-1] - b[1]\n  Possibility 2: Remove the last element (the largest). Then the new instability is (second last element - first element) = b[n-2] - b[0]\n\n  But what if we remove an element that is not the first or last? Then the instability remains (b[n-1]-b[0]).\n\n  However, note: what if the array has duplicate values? Consider [1,1,3,7]. \n      Possibility 1: Remove the first 1 -> [1,3,7]: min=1, max=7 -> instability=6.\n      Possibility 2: Remove the last 7 -> [1,1,3]: min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n  So we see that removing the last element gives a better result.\n\n  Now, consider [1,2,3,4]:\n      Possibility 1: Remove first -> [2,3,4]: instability=2\n      Possibility 2: Remove last -> [1,2,3]: instability=2\n      Original: 3\n\n  But wait, what if we remove an element from the middle? Then the array becomes [1,2,4] or [1,2,3] or [1,3,4]? Actually, we are only allowed to remove one element. The best is 2.\n\n  However, note: we can also consider removing an element that is not the first or last, but that doesn't change the min and max? For example, remove 2 from [1,2,3,4] -> [1,3,4]: min=1, max=4 -> instability=3, which is worse.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal instability must be the minimum between:\n      candidate1: b[n-1] - b[1]   (remove the first element)\n      candidate2: b[n-2] - b[0]   (remove the last element)\n\n  But wait: what if we remove an element that is the smallest but not at the beginning? For example, in [1,2,3,4] if we remove the 1 (which is the first) we get candidate1. But if the smallest appears in the middle? Actually, the array is sorted, so the smallest is at the beginning.\n\n  However, note: the problem does not require the array to be sorted. But we can sort the array.\n\n  But consider: what if we have [1, 100, 200, 300] and we remove the 1? Then the new array is [100,200,300] -> instability 200. But if we remove the 300, we get [1,100,200] -> instability 199. But wait, what if we remove the 100? Then the array becomes [1,200,300] -> instability 299, which is worse.\n\n  However, note that we are allowed to remove exactly one element. And we are not forced to remove the first or last. But the above reasoning says that if we remove an element that is not the min or max, then the min and max remain the same (unless the min or max is duplicated, but in this case the min is 1 and max is 300, and they are unique). So if we remove 100, the min and max are still 1 and 300 -> instability 299.\n\n  So the minimal instability must be the minimum between candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n  But wait, what if we have an array with multiple minima and maxima? Example: [1,1,2,3,3,4]\n\n  Possibility 1: Remove the first 1 -> [1,2,3,3,4]: min=1, max=4 -> instability=3.\n  Possibility 2: Remove the last 4 -> [1,1,2,3,3]: min=1, max=3 -> instability=2.\n\n  But what if we remove the first occurrence of 1 and then the min is still 1? Then the instability is 3. Similarly, if we remove the last 4, then the max becomes 3. However, we are allowed to remove any one element. So we can choose to remove the 4, which gives 2.\n\n  However, what if we remove an element that is not the smallest or largest? For example, remove the first 1: we get 3. Remove the last 4: we get 2. Remove a 3? Then the array becomes [1,1,2,3,4] -> min=1, max=4 -> instability=3. Remove a 2? Then [1,1,3,3,4] -> min=1, max=4 -> 3. Remove the other 1? Same as removing the first 1.\n\n  So the minimal instability is 2.\n\n  How do we capture that?\n\n  We can consider two scenarios:\n\n  Scenario 1: The array without its smallest element (any occurrence of the smallest). Then the instability is (max of entire array) - (next smallest element, which is the smallest element if there are duplicates, but actually we can remove one occurrence and then the smallest might still be present). \n\n  Actually, the minimal instability we can achieve by removing one element is the minimum over:\n\n      For each distinct value x in the array, consider removing one occurrence of x and compute the new min and max.\n\n  However, that would be O(n) and n can be up to 10^5, but note: we don't need to iterate over all distinct values. The key is that the min and max of the entire array are fixed. Removing an element that is not the min or max doesn't change the min and max. Removing the min (if it's the only occurrence) changes the min, similarly for max.\n\n  But note: the min and max might appear multiple times. So:\n\n  Let m = min(a), M = max(a)\n\n  Then, the minimal instability after removal is the minimum among:\n\n      candidate1: If there exists at least one occurrence of m, then when we remove one occurrence, the new min is:\n          if count(m) > 1: then the new min is still m, so instability = M - m (same as original)\n          else: the new min is the next value (which is the smallest value greater than m). But note: we don't know the next value? Actually, we can precompute the next distinct value after m and the previous distinct value before M.\n\n  However, we can use the sorted array:\n\n      Sort the array: b\n\n      Then, if we remove the smallest element (b[0]), the new min is b[1] (if we remove the first element) and the max is b[-1]. But note: if there are duplicates, then b[1] might be equal to b[0] (if the smallest appears multiple times). \n\n  Actually, the correct way:\n\n      candidate1: Remove one occurrence of the smallest (b[0]): \n          If there are multiple smallest, then the new min is still b[0] (because we removed one, but there's still at least one left). So the instability is (b[-1] - b[0]).\n          If there is only one smallest, then the new min is b[1] (the next distinct value) and the max is b[-1]. So instability = b[-1] - b[1].\n\n      Similarly, candidate2: Remove one occurrence of the largest (b[-1]):\n          If there are multiple largest, then the new max is still b[-1] (because we removed one, but there's still at least one left) -> instability = b[-1] - b[0] (same as original).\n          If there is only one largest, then the new max is b[-2] and the min is b[0] -> instability = b[-2] - b[0].\n\n  But wait, we are allowed to remove any one element. So we can also remove an element that is not the smallest or largest, but then the min and max remain the same. So the candidate for such removal is the original instability (b[-1]-b[0]).\n\n  However, note: we are trying to minimize. So we are interested in the minimum among:\n\n      candidate1: (if we remove the smallest and there are duplicates) then (b[-1]-b[0])\n                 (if we remove the smallest and there is only one occurrence) then (b[-1]-b[1])\n\n      candidate2: (if we remove the largest and there are duplicates) then (b[-1]-b[0])\n                 (if we remove the largest and there is only one occurrence) then (b[-2]-b[0])\n\n      candidate3: (if we remove an element that is neither) then (b[-1]-b[0])\n\n  But note: candidate1 and candidate2 might be worse than the original? Actually, we want to minimize.\n\n  However, we don't know the counts of the smallest and largest. But we can do:\n\n      Let sorted_arr = sorted(a)\n\n      Then, the original instability is sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[0]\n\n      Now, consider:\n\n        candidate_remove_min = \n            if sorted_arr[0] != sorted_arr[1]:   # meaning the smallest is unique\n                then instability_after_removing_one_min = sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[1]\n            else:\n                then instability_after_removing_one_min = sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[0]   # because the min remains\n\n        Similarly,\n        candidate_remove_max =\n            if sorted_arr[-1] != sorted_arr[-2]:\n                then instability_after_removing_one_max = sorted_arr[-2] - sorted_arr[0]\n            else:\n                then instability_after_removing_one_max = sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[0]\n\n      Then, the answer is the minimum among:\n\n          candidate_remove_min, candidate_remove_max, and the original instability (but wait, the original instability is the same as candidate_remove_min or candidate_remove_max when there are duplicates, and when there are no duplicates, removing the min or max gives a better result? Actually, no: when there are duplicates, removing the min (or max) doesn't change the min (or max) so the instability remains the same. But we are allowed to remove any element, and sometimes we might get a better result by removing an element that is not the min or max? \n\n      Let me clarify: \n\n        If we remove an element that is not the min or max, the min and max remain the same, so the instability is the original.\n\n        The best we can do is to remove one element to possibly drop the min or the max.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n            candidate_remove_min (if we remove the smallest, and if the smallest is unique then we get a drop, else not) \n            candidate_remove_max (similarly)\n\n        But note: we are allowed to remove any one element. So we can choose the best removal.\n\n        We can also consider: maybe removing an element that is not the min or max can lead to a situation where the min or max changes? No, because if we don't remove the min, the min remains; if we don't remove the max, the max remains.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal instability is:\n\n          min( \n              (sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[1]) if sorted_arr[0] < sorted_arr[1] else (sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[0]),   # This is candidate_remove_min: if the smallest is unique then we use sorted_arr[1] as the new min, else we use the same min (so the difference remains)\n              (sorted_arr[-2] - sorted_arr[0]) if sorted_arr[-1] > sorted_arr[-2] else (sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[0])      # candidate_remove_max: if the largest is unique then we use sorted_arr[-2] as the new max, else the same max\n          )\n\n      But wait, is that sufficient? What if the array has only two elements? Example: [1,2]. Then:\n\n          sorted_arr = [1,2]\n\n          candidate_remove_min: \n             if sorted_arr[0] < sorted_arr[1] -> True, so candidate_remove_min = 2 - 1 = 1.\n          candidate_remove_max:\n             if sorted_arr[-1] > sorted_arr[-2] -> True, so candidate_remove_max = sorted_arr[-2]-sorted_arr[0] = 2-1 = 1.\n\n          Then the answer is 1.\n\n      Another example: [1,1,2] \n          sorted_arr = [1,1,2]\n\n          candidate_remove_min: \n             sorted_arr[0] == sorted_arr[1] -> so we use the else branch: candidate_remove_min = 2-1 = 1.\n          candidate_remove_max:\n             sorted_arr[-1] > sorted_arr[-2] -> 2>1 -> True, so candidate_remove_max = 1-1 = 0.\n\n          Then the answer is 0.\n\n      However, wait: if we remove the max (2) from [1,1,2], then the array becomes [1,1] -> instability = 0. Correct.\n\n      But wait, what if we remove one of the 1's? Then the array becomes [1,2] -> instability = 1. So we have two possibilities. Our candidate_remove_min was computed assuming we remove the smallest (and since there are duplicates, we don't change the min) so the instability remains 2-1=1. But note: we are allowed to choose which removal. So we should take the minimum of the two candidate removals.\n\n      However, we are also allowed to remove an element that is not the smallest? But in this case, the smallest is 1 and the largest is 2. Removing the 2 gives 0, which is better than removing a 1 (which gives 1). So our candidate_remove_min is 1 and candidate_remove_max is 0, and the answer is 0.\n\n      But wait, what if we remove the smallest (one of the 1's)? Then the instability is 1, but we are not forced to consider that candidate? Actually, we are considering two specific removals: removing the smallest (by which we mean we remove one occurrence of the smallest) and removing the largest (one occurrence of the largest). \n\n      However, note: the problem allows removing any one element. We don't have to remove the smallest or the largest. But we argued that removing an element that is not the smallest or largest leaves the min and max unchanged. So the instability remains the original (which is 1). But we have two other possibilities: removing the smallest (which leaves the min unchanged) and removing the largest (which changes the max). So we have three possibilities:\n\n        Remove the smallest (one of the 1's): instability = 2-1 = 1.\n        Remove the largest (the 2): instability = 1-1 = 0.\n        Remove the other smallest (the other 1): same as above.\n\n      Therefore, we must consider the two removals: removing the smallest (at least one occurrence) and removing the largest (at least one occurrence). And then take the minimum of these two possibilities.\n\n      Why is that sufficient? Because if we remove an element that is not the smallest or largest, the instability is the original (which is 1) and we are already considering two possibilities (both <= 1) so the minimum is 0.\n\n      However, wait: in the example [1,1,2] the original instability is 1. But we are allowed to remove an element that is not the smallest or largest? There isn't one. But in general, if we have [1,2,3,4] (all distinct), then removing an element that is not the smallest or largest (like 2 or 3) leaves the instability as 3 (from 1 to 4). So we don't want that.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n          candidate1: removing the smallest (if the smallest is unique, then the instability becomes (M - next_min)), else (M - m)\n          candidate2: removing the largest (if the largest is unique, then the instability becomes (next_max - m)), else (M - m)\n\n      And note: we don't need to consider other removals because they yield the original instability (which is M-m) and we are trying to minimize.\n\n      However, wait: what if the array has more than two distinct numbers? Example: [1,2,3,4] (all distinct). Then:\n\n          candidate_remove_min: remove 1 -> instability = 4-2 = 2.\n          candidate_remove_max: remove 4 -> instability = 3-1 = 2.\n          candidate_remove_other: 2 or 3 -> instability = 4-1 = 3.\n\n          So the minimal is 2.\n\n      But note: we are allowed to remove any one element. We are considering two removals (min and max) and the rest are worse. So we take 2.\n\n      However, wait: what if we remove an element that is the smallest and then the new min is the next smallest, and then the new max is the same (if we don't remove the max). But note: if we remove the smallest, the max remains the same (unless we remove the max too, but we only remove one). Similarly for the largest.\n\n      Therefore, the answer is the minimum between:\n\n          candidate_remove_min = (if the smallest appears only once) then (M - next_min) else (M - m)\n          candidate_remove_max = (if the largest appears only once) then (next_max - m) else (M - m)\n\n      But note: the next_min is the smallest value that is greater than m. In the sorted array, if we remove the first occurrence (which is the smallest) then the next_min is the next element (which is the next distinct value). However, if there are duplicates, then the next_min might be the same as m. But wait: we defined candidate_remove_min as:\n\n          if the smallest is unique (i.e., the first element is different from the second) then we use the second element (which is the next distinct value) as the new min.\n\n          But if there are duplicates, then the next_min is still m, so the instability is M - m.\n\n      Similarly for candidate_remove_max.\n\n      However, note: the condition for uniqueness is:\n\n          candidate_remove_min: \n            if sorted_arr[0] < sorted_arr[1] -> then the smallest is unique, so we use sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[1]\n            else -> use sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[0]\n\n      Similarly for candidate_remove_max:\n            if sorted_arr[-1] > sorted_arr[-2] -> then the largest is unique, so we use sorted_arr[-2] - sorted_arr[0]\n            else -> use sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[0]\n\n      Then, we take the minimum between candidate_remove_min and candidate_remove_max.\n\n      But wait: is it possible that the two candidates are the same? Then we just return that.\n\n      However, what if the array is [1,2,3,4] (all distinct)? Then:\n\n          candidate_remove_min = 4 - 2 = 2\n          candidate_remove_max = 3 - 1 = 2\n\n      Then answer=2.\n\n      Example: [1,1,100000] (n=3, two 1's and one 100000)\n\n          candidate_remove_min: \n            sorted_arr = [1,1,100000]\n            smallest is not unique (1==1) -> candidate_remove_min = 100000 - 1 = 99999\n          candidate_remove_max:\n            sorted_arr[-1]=100000, sorted_arr[-2]=1 -> 100000>1 -> unique, so candidate_remove_max = 1-1=0\n\n          Then answer=0.\n\n      Example: [1,2,2,10] (n=4)\n\n          candidate_remove_min: \n            smallest is 1, unique? yes, because 1<2 -> so candidate_remove_min = 10-2 = 8\n          candidate_remove_max:\n            largest is 10, unique? yes, because 10>2 -> candidate_remove_max = 2-1=1\n\n          Then answer=1.\n\n      Example: [1,2,2,10,10] (n=5)\n\n          candidate_remove_min: smallest is 1, unique -> 10-2=8\n          candidate_remove_max: largest is 10, but there are two 10's -> so candidate_remove_max = 10-1=9\n\n          Then answer=8.\n\n      Example: [1,2,2,10] -> we computed 1.\n\n      But wait: if we remove the 10 from [1,2,2,10] then the array becomes [1,2,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability=1. Correct.\n\n      Example: [1,2,2,10,10] -> removing 10: the array becomes [1,2,2,10] -> min=1, max=10 -> instability=9. Removing the 1: [2,2,10,10] -> min=2, max=10 -> instability=8. Removing a 2: [1,2,10,10] -> min=1, max=10 -> 9. Removing another 2: same as above. So the best is 8.\n\n      Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and the list of n integers.\n        Step 2: Sort the list.\n        Step 3: \n            candidate1 = None\n            candidate2 = None\n\n            # Check for candidate1: remove the smallest\n            if n >= 2:\n                # Check if the first element is unique\n                if sorted_arr[0] < sorted_arr[1]:\n                    candidate1 = sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[1]\n                else:\n                    candidate1 = sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[0]\n\n            # Check for candidate2: remove the largest\n            if n >= 2:\n                if sorted_arr[-1] > sorted_arr[-2]:\n                    candidate2 = sorted_arr[-2] - sorted_arr[0]\n                else:\n                    candidate2 = sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[0]\n\n            Then, the answer is min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n        But wait: what if n==2? Then we have two elements.\n\n        Example: [1,2] (n=2)\n            candidate1: sorted_arr[0]=1 < sorted_arr[1]=2 -> True, so candidate1 = 2-1 = 1\n            candidate2: sorted_arr[-1]=2 > sorted_arr[-2]=1 -> True, so candidate2 = 1-1 = 0? Wait, no: candidate2 formula is sorted_arr[-2]-sorted_arr[0] = 1-1=0.\n\n            Then answer = min(1,0)=0.\n\n        But wait, [1,2] has two elements. Removing one element leaves one element. The instability of an array with one element is 0 (because max-min=0). So that is correct.\n\n        However, let me check: [1,2] -> remove 1: [2] -> instability=0; remove 2: [1] -> instability=0. So we can get 0.\n\n        But note: our candidate1 and candidate2 are defined for removal of the smallest and the largest. In [1,2], the smallest is 1 and the largest is 2. Removing the smallest (1) leaves [2] -> instability=0. Removing the largest (2) leaves [1] -> instability=0. So both candidates are 0? Actually, no:\n\n            candidate1: remove the smallest (1) -> the array becomes [2]: min=2, max=2 -> instability=0.\n            candidate2: remove the largest (2) -> the array becomes [1]: min=1, max=1 -> instability=0.\n\n        But wait, how did we compute candidate1 for [1,2]?\n            candidate1: because 1<2, so candidate1 = 2-1? That would be 1, but that is not correct.\n\n        Correction: When we remove the smallest (1) from [1,2], the array becomes [2]. The new min and max are both 2. So the instability is 0.\n\n        Similarly, removing the largest (2) leaves [1] -> instability 0.\n\n        So why did we use the formula:\n\n            candidate1 = sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[1]   if the smallest is unique?\n\n        In [1,2]: \n            sorted_arr[0]=1, sorted_arr[1]=2 -> unique smallest -> then we use sorted_arr[-1] (which is 2) - sorted_arr[1] (which is 2) -> 0.\n\n        But wait, the formula for candidate1: \n            if the smallest is unique, then the new min is the next smallest (which is sorted_arr[1]) and the max is the original max (sorted_arr[-1]). So the instability is sorted_arr[-1] - sorted_arr[1] = 2-2=0.\n\n        Similarly, candidate2: \n            if the largest is unique, then the new max is sorted_arr[-2] and the min is sorted_arr[0]. So instability = sorted_arr[-2] - sorted_arr[0] = 1-1=0.\n\n        So the formula is correct.\n\n        However, note: in the example [1,2] the smallest is unique and the next smallest is 2, which is the same as the max. So the instability becomes 0.\n\n        But wait, what if we have [1,2,3] (n=3, distinct)?\n\n          candidate1: remove smallest (1) -> new min=2, max=3 -> instability=1.\n          candidate2: remove largest (3) -> new min=1, max=2 -> instability=1.\n\n        Formula: \n          candidate1: 3-2 = 1\n          candidate2: 2-1 = 1\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          arr_sorted = sorted(arr)\n\n          # If n==1, but the problem states n>=2, so we don't handle n==1.\n\n          if n == 2:\n              # Then we have two elements. We can remove one and get an array of one element -> instability 0.\n              # But our formula works for n>=2.\n              pass\n\n          candidate1 = float('inf')\n          candidate2 = float('inf')\n\n          # Candidate1: remove the smallest\n          if arr_sorted[0] < arr_sorted[1]:\n              candidate1 = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[1]\n          else:\n              candidate1 = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[0]\n\n          # Candidate2: remove the largest\n          if arr_sorted[-1] > arr_sorted[-2]:\n              candidate2 = arr_sorted[-2] - arr_sorted[0]\n          else:\n              candidate2 = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[0]\n\n          ans = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n          print(ans)\n\n      Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"4\\n1 3 3 7\"\n            sorted_arr = [1,3,3,7]\n            candidate1: 1 < 3 -> True, so candidate1 = 7-3 = 4.\n            candidate2: 7>3 -> True, so candidate2 = 3-1 = 2.\n            ans = 2 -> matches.\n\n        Example 2: \"2\\n1 100000\"\n            sorted_arr = [1, 100000]\n            candidate1: 1<100000 -> True, candidate1 = 100000-100000 = 0.\n            candidate2: 100000>1 -> True, candidate2 = 1-1=0.\n            ans=0 -> matches.\n\n        Example 3: [1,2] -> 0, as above.\n\n        Example 4: [1,2,3,4] (distinct) -> \n            candidate1: 4-2=2\n            candidate2: 3-1=2 -> ans=2.\n\n        Example 5: [1,1,2] -> \n            candidate1: 1==1 -> else branch: candidate1 = 2-1=1.\n            candidate2: 2>1 -> True: candidate2 = 1-1=0 -> ans=0.\n\n        Example 6: [1,2,2,10] -> \n            candidate1: 1<2 -> True: candidate1 = 10-2=8.\n            candidate2: 10>2 -> True: candidate2 = 2-1=1 -> ans=1.\n\n        Example 7: [1,2,2,10,10] -> \n            candidate1: 1<2 -> True: candidate1 = 10-2=8.\n            candidate2: 10==10 -> else: candidate2 = 10-1=9 -> ans=8.\n\n      But wait, in example 5: [1,1,2] we got 0, which is correct.\n\n      However, note: in example 5, if we remove the smallest (one of the 1's) then the array becomes [1,2] -> instability=1. But wait, we are allowed to remove the largest (the 2) to get [1,1] -> instability=0. So the minimal is 0.\n\n      The code is working.\n\n      But wait, why in the candidate1 for [1,1,2] we did the else branch? Because the smallest (1) is not unique (since the next element is 1). Then we use the entire array's max (2) minus the smallest (1) -> 1. But note: when we remove one of the 1's, the min remains 1 (because there is still one 1 left) so the instability is 2-1=1. But we can also remove the 2, which gives 0. So the minimal is 0.\n\n      The code correctly considers candidate1 and candidate2 separately and takes the minimum.\n\n      Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        arr_sorted = sorted(arr)\n\n        # If the array has at least two elements (given n>=2)\n        if n == 2:\n            # We can remove one element and get an array of one element -> instability 0.\n            # But our formula also works for n=2.\n            pass\n\n        if arr_sorted[0] < arr_sorted[1]:\n            candidate1 = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[1]\n        else:\n            candidate1 = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[0]\n\n        if arr_sorted[-1] > arr_sorted[-2]:\n            candidate2 = arr_sorted[-2] - arr_sorted[0]\n        else:\n            candidate2 = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[0]\n\n        ans = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n        print(ans)\n\n      However, note: the above code uses arr_sorted[-1] and arr_sorted[-2] for candidate2. But if n==1, we don't handle. But n>=2.\n\n      Let me test with n=2: [1,2] -> \n          candidate1: arr_sorted[0]=1 < arr_sorted[1]=2 -> True, so candidate1 = 2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that removing an element from the array can potentially change either the minimum or the maximum (or both) values of the array. The minimal instability is achieved by either:\n   - Removing the smallest element (if it is unique, the new minimum becomes the next smallest element; otherwise, the minimum remains the same).\n   - Removing the largest element (if it is unique, the new maximum becomes the next largest element; otherwise, the maximum remains the same).\n\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the smallest and largest elements. The solution involves checking two scenarios:\n   - **Scenario 1**: Remove the smallest element and compute the new instability.\n   - **Scenario 2**: Remove the largest element and compute the new instability.\n   The minimal instability between these two scenarios is the answer.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily identify the smallest and largest elements.\n   - **Comparison**: For each scenario, compare the current smallest or largest element with its adjacent element in the sorted array to determine if it is unique. This helps in deciding whether the removal affects the minimum or maximum value of the array.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: The dominant operation is sorting the array, which has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) for storing the array, which is optimal for the given problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\narr_sorted = sorted(arr)\n\nif arr_sorted[0] < arr_sorted[1]:\n    candidate1 = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[1]\nelse:\n    candidate1 = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[0]\n\nif arr_sorted[-1] > arr_sorted[-2]:\n    candidate2 = arr_sorted[-2] - arr_sorted[0]\nelse:\n    candidate2 = arr_sorted[-1] - arr_sorted[0]\n\nans = min(candidate1, candidate2)\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` (number of elements) and an array `arr` of `n` integers.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to facilitate easy access to the smallest and largest elements.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**:\n   - **Candidate1**: If the smallest element is unique, removing it sets the new minimum to the next smallest element. Otherwise, the minimum remains unchanged.\n   - **Candidate2**: If the largest element is unique, removing it sets the new maximum to the next largest element. Otherwise, the maximum remains unchanged.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimal instability is the smaller value between `candidate1` and `candidate2`.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the minimal instability achievable by removing exactly one element from the array.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to two critical scenarios, leveraging sorting to simplify the identification of key elements and their impact on the array's instability.",
