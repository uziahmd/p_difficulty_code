Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering the gaps between lanterns and the ends.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n 2. The entire street must be covered from 0 to l.\n 3. Consider two parts: \n    a) The left end (from 0 to the first lantern)\n    b) The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n    c) The right end (from the last lantern to l)\n\n 4. For the left end: we need to cover from 0 to the first lantern at position a0.\n    The required d for the left end is at least a0 / 2.0.\n\n 5. For the gaps between two consecutive lanterns (say, between a[i] and a[i+1]):\n    The gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]). To cover this gap, the two lanterns must have their light overlap or meet.\n    The required d for this gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0.\n\n 6. For the right end: we need to cover from the last lantern (at position a[-1]) to l.\n    The required d for the right end is (l - a[-1]) / 2.0.\n\n 7. However, note that the lanterns can cover beyond their own positions. We are to find the minimum d such that the entire street is lit.\n\n 8. Actually, we can think of the entire street being covered if the maximum of the following is sufficient:\n    - The left gap: d >= (a[0] - 0) / 2.0? Actually, the first lantern must cover from 0 to a[0]. So d must be at least (a[0])/2. But wait: if d is at least a0, then the first lantern covers [0, a0+d] which must include 0. Actually, the condition for the left end is: the leftmost point 0 must be within d of the first lantern, i.e., a0 <= d + 0 => d >= a0. However, wait: the lantern at a0 lights from (a0-d) to (a0+d). So to cover 0, we require a0-d <= 0 <= a0+d -> but since 0 is to the left, we only need 0 <= a0+d. Since a0>=0, that condition is automatically satisfied if d>=0. However, we also have the requirement that the entire street is lit. The key is that the light must extend from the lantern to the left and right.\n\n Actually, let's reframe:\n\n The entire street is lit if:\n   - The left end (0) is covered by the first lantern: so we require that the first lantern's left side reaches 0, i.e., d >= a0 (if we consider the lantern at a0 must cover from 0 to a0). But wait: actually, the condition is that the light from the first lantern must extend to 0. The distance from a0 to 0 is a0, so we require d >= a0. Similarly, the last lantern must extend to l, so d >= (l - a_last).\n\n However, that is not the whole story because we have multiple lanterns. In fact, the requirement for the entire street is that the union of the intervals [a_i - d, a_i + d] must cover [0, l].\n\n We can also consider the gaps between lanterns. The maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns (after sorting) is (a[i+1] - a[i]). To cover the gap, the two lanterns must have their lights meet or overlap. The condition for two consecutive lanterns is: d must be at least half the gap, i.e., (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.\n\n However, note: if we set d to be the maximum of:\n   left_gap = a0  (but wait: actually, we require that the first lantern's left side goes to 0, so the necessary d for the left end is a0/2? Not exactly.)\n\n Let me clarify with the example: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n We have two lanterns at 2 and 5. The street is from 0 to 5.\n\n For the left end: the first lantern at 2 must cover 0. The distance from 2 to 0 is 2, so d must be at least 2? Then the first lantern would cover [-2, 4] which covers 0 and part of the street. Then the second lantern at 5 must cover the remaining from 4 to 5. The distance from 5 to 4 is 1, so d must be at least 1. Therefore, the overall d must be at least 2.\n\n But wait, the sample output is 2.0.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it\". So the first lantern at 2 with d=2 covers [0,4]. The second lantern at 5 with d=2 covers [3,7]. Now, the entire street [0,5] is covered because [0,4] and [3,5] (since 5 is included) and note that the segment [4,5] is covered by the second lantern because 5-2=3, but wait: the second lantern's coverage is [5-2, 5+2] = [3,7] so indeed [4,5] is covered.\n\n However, what if we set d=1? Then the first lantern covers [1,3] and the second lantern covers [4,6]. Then the street from 0 to 1 and from 3 to 4 is not covered. So d=1 is insufficient.\n\n Now, what is the minimal d? We can consider:\n\n Option 1: Cover the left end: requires d >= 2 (from the first lantern: to cover 0, we need d>=2).\n Option 2: Cover the gap between the two lanterns: the gap is from 2 to 5, which is 3. The condition for covering the gap between two consecutive lanterns is that d must be at least (5-2)/2 = 1.5. But wait, with d=1.5, the first lantern covers [0.5, 3.5] and the second lantern covers [3.5,6.5]. Then the point 0 is not covered (because 0.5>0) and the point 0 is not lit. So that doesn't work.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the entire street must be covered. We can break the problem into segments:\n\n 1. From 0 to the first lantern: the first lantern must cover from 0 to at least its own position. The distance from 0 to the first lantern is a0. So the first lantern must have a light that extends to 0: i.e., a0 - d <= 0 => d >= a0 (if we consider the left side). But note: the light is symmetric. Actually, the condition for the first lantern is that d must be at least the distance from the first lantern to the start (which is a0). Similarly, for the last lantern, d must be at least (l - a_last).\n\n However, that is one way. But consider the middle: we need to ensure that between two lanterns, the gap is covered. The gap between two consecutive lanterns at positions x and y (with x<=y) is (y-x). The condition is that the right side of the left lantern must meet the left side of the right lantern. The left lantern's right side is x+d, and the right lantern's left side is y-d. We require x+d >= y-d, i.e., 2*d >= y-x. So d >= (y-x)/2.\n\n Therefore, the minimal d must be at least the maximum of:\n   - a0 (to cover the left end)   -> but wait, actually for the left end we require that the first lantern's left side reaches 0: so d >= a0 (because the leftmost point 0 must be within d from a0: |0 - a0| <= d -> d>=a0). Similarly, for the right end, d >= (l - a_last).\n\n However, note: the above reasoning for the left end is correct only if we assume that the first lantern is the one that must cover the left end. But what if there is more than one lantern? Actually, the entire street must be covered. The left end is 0. The first lantern is at a0. The condition for 0 is: d >= a0. Similarly, the condition for the right end is: d >= l - a_last.\n\n But now, consider the gap in the middle: we might have a large gap that requires d to be even larger. However, note that the condition for the gap is d >= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2. \n\n Actually, the minimal d is the maximum of three values:\n   candidate1 = a[0] / 2.0   ??? Wait, no.\n\n Let me think again:\n\n The entire street is covered if:\n\n 1. The first lantern covers from 0 to a0+d. But we require that the entire street starts at 0, so the first lantern must have d at least the distance from a0 to 0, which is a0. However, wait: if we have multiple lanterns, maybe we don't need the first lantern to cover the entire left part by itself? Actually, the first lantern is the closest to the left end. The condition is that the first lantern must cover the segment from 0 to ... at least until the next lantern? Actually, no: the entire street must be covered, so the leftmost part is 0, and the first lantern must cover 0. The condition is: d >= a0 (because the distance from a0 to 0 is a0). Similarly, for the last lantern, d >= (l - a_last).\n\n But then, what about the gaps between lanterns? Consider two lanterns at positions a and b (a < b). The gap between them is (b - a). To cover the gap, we require that the right side of the left lantern (a+d) meets the left side of the right lantern (b-d). So we require a+d >= b-d, i.e., d >= (b-a)/2.\n\n However, note: the entire street must be covered from 0 to l. The condition for the left end is d >= a0 (so that the first lantern covers 0). The condition for the right end is d >= (l - a_last). And the condition for the gaps is d >= (gap between consecutive lanterns)/2.\n\n But wait: is the left end condition really d >= a0? Actually, no: the first lantern at a0 must cover 0, so the distance from a0 to 0 is a0, so we require d >= a0. Similarly, for the right end, the last lantern must cover l, so the distance from a_last to l is (l - a_last), so we require d >= (l - a_last). \n\n However, consider: if we have two lanterns, the first at 0 and the last at l, then the conditions are:\n   left_end: d >= 0 (which is trivial)\n   right_end: d >= 0 (trivial)\n   and the gap between 0 and l: d >= (l-0)/2.\n\n So the answer would be max(0,0,(l-0)/2) = l/2.\n\n But wait, in the example \"2 5\\n2 5\", we have two lanterns at 2 and 5, so the gap is 3, and the condition for the gap is 3/2=1.5. However, the condition for the left end is 2 (distance from 2 to 0) and for the right end is 0 (because 5 to 5 is 0, but wait: the last lantern at 5 must cover up to 5, so the condition for the right end is (5-5)=0, but the street goes to 5, so the last lantern must cover from 5-d to 5+d, and to cover the point 5, we require that 5 is at most 5+d (which is always true) and the point just to the right of 5? No, the street ends at 5. But the condition is that the entire street [0,5] is lit. The last lantern must cover the point 5, which is done as long as d>=0. However, the part from 0 to 5 must be covered.\n\n But note: the first lantern at 2 must cover the left part until 0, so d>=2. The gap condition requires d>= (5-2)/2 = 1.5. The right end condition is (5-5)=0, so 0. Then the answer would be the maximum of these: max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0. This matches.\n\n However, let me test with another example: n=1, l=10, and the lantern at 5.\n\n Conditions:\n   left_end: d >= 5 (because the first and only lantern at 5 must cover 0, so d>=5)\n   right_end: d >= (10-5)=5\n   no gaps (n=1, so no consecutive gaps)\n   Then the answer is 5.\n\n But what if we set d=5? Then the lantern covers [0,10] which is the entire street. Correct.\n\n Another example: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 3 and 7.\n\n Conditions:\n   left_end: d >= 3\n   right_end: d >= (10-7)=3\n   gap: (7-3)=4, so d>=2.\n\n Then the answer is max(3,3,2)=3.\n\n Check: with d=3, the first lantern covers [0,6] and the second lantern covers [4,10]. The entire street [0,10] is covered? \n   From 0 to 6: covered by first.\n   From 4 to 10: covered by second.\n   What about 6 to 4? Actually, the first lantern goes to 6 and the second starts at 4, so there is an overlap from 4 to 6. The entire street is covered.\n\n However, wait: the condition for the gap was d>=2, but we used d=3 which is greater than 2. That's okay because we take the maximum.\n\n But note: the condition for the gap is that the two lanterns must meet or overlap. The gap between 3 and 7 is 4, so the condition is d>=2. However, we also have the conditions from the ends. The ends require d>=3. So the overall d must be 3.\n\n How about if we set d=2? Then the first lantern covers [1,5] and the second lantern covers [5,9]. Then the street from 0 to 1 is not covered (by the first lantern: 0 is not covered because 3-2=1, so 0 is not included). So d=2 is insufficient.\n\n Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n  Step 1: Read n and l.\n  Step 2: Read the list of n integers (lantern positions).\n  Step 3: Sort the list.\n  Step 4: Consider the gaps and the ends.\n\n  Conditions:\n    d1 = a[0]  # to cover from 0 to a[0] (the left end): we need d >= a[0] (because the first lantern must cover 0, and the distance from a[0] to 0 is a[0])\n    d2 = l - a[-1]  # to cover from a[-1] to l\n    d3 = 0\n    For i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        d3 = max(d3, gap/2.0)\n\n  Then the answer is the maximum of d1, d2, and d3.\n\n However, wait: is the left end condition really d1 = a[0]? \n\n Let me check: the first lantern is at a[0]. To cover 0, we require that the left end of the first lantern (a[0]-d) is <= 0. But note, the light is defined as points within d, so the condition is: 0 must be in [a[0]-d, a[0]+d]. Since a[0]>=0, the left side is the constraint: a[0]-d <= 0  => d >= a[0]. \n\n Similarly, for the last lantern: we require l <= a[-1]+d, and since the light extends to the right, we have a[-1]+d >= l  => d >= l - a[-1].\n\n But note: the condition for the left end is actually that the entire segment from 0 to the first lantern must be covered. However, the first lantern alone must cover the point 0. The condition d>=a[0] ensures that the first lantern's light reaches 0. Similarly, for the last lantern, d>= (l - a[-1]) ensures that the last lantern's light reaches l.\n\n However, consider if the first lantern is at 0. Then d>=0, which is fine.\n\n But wait: what if we have a lantern at 0 and then the next lantern at 10, and the street goes to 20? Then the condition for the left end is 0 (so d>=0), for the right end is 10 (because 20-10=10), and for the gap between 0 and 10 is 10/2=5. Then the answer is max(0,10,5)=10.\n\n With d=10, the first lantern (at 0) covers [-10,10] and the second lantern (at 10) covers [0,20]. Then the entire street [0,20] is covered.\n\n But note: the condition for the gap between the first and second lantern (0 and 10) is that d>=5. Why is 10>=5? Yes, but is 10 the minimal? Actually, the minimal d is 10 because of the right end.\n\n However, let me check if d=10 is the minimal. What if we set d=5? Then the first lantern (at 0) covers [-5,5] and the second lantern (at 10) covers [5,15]. Then the street from 0 to 20: \n   From 0 to 5 is covered by the first lantern.\n   From 5 to 15 is covered by the second lantern.\n   But then from 15 to 20 is not covered. So d=5 is insufficient because the right end requires d>=10.\n\n Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n   d = max( a[0], \n            l - a[-1],\n            max( (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0 for i in range(n-1) ) \n          )\n\n However, note: the condition for the left end is actually the distance from the first lantern to the start (which is a[0]), and similarly for the right end. But wait, the condition for the gap is independent.\n\n But wait, what if we have a single lantern? Then we don't have any consecutive gaps, but we have the left and right conditions.\n\n Example: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then:\n   d = max(5, 10-5=5, max() ) = 5.\n\n Example: n=0? The problem states n>=1.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n   First, sort: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n   left_end: 0 (since a[0]=0) -> d1 = 0\n   right_end: 15-15=0 -> d2=0\n   gaps: \n      3-0=3 -> 1.5\n      5-3=2 -> 1.0\n      7-5=2 -> 1.0\n      9-7=2 -> 1.0\n      14-9=5 -> 2.5\n      15-14=1 -> 0.5\n   Then d3 = max(1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5\n\n   Then answer = max(0,0,2.5) = 2.5 -> matches.\n\n Example 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n   sorted: [2,5]\n   left_end: 2\n   right_end: 5-5=0\n   gaps: (5-2)=3 -> 1.5\n   Then answer = max(2,0,1.5)=2.0 -> matches.\n\n But wait: in the example [0,3,5,7,9,14,15] for the left_end we have 0, but the condition for the left_end is 0, meaning d>=0. However, the entire street must be covered. The first lantern is at 0, so the left_end is covered. The gaps are the critical part.\n\n However, note: the condition for the left_end is that the first lantern must cover the left end (0). The first lantern is at 0, so d>=0 is correct.\n\n But wait, what if the first lantern is at 0 and the next lantern is at 3? Then the gap between 0 and 3 is 3, and the condition for the gap is 1.5. However, the left_end condition is 0. Then the answer is 1.5. Let me check:\n\n   d=1.5: \n     First lantern (0): covers [-1.5, 1.5] -> includes 0 to 1.5.\n     Second lantern (3): covers [1.5,4.5] -> so the gap from 0 to 3 is covered.\n\n   But wait, the entire street is from 0 to 15. We have other lanterns. The condition for the entire street is the maximum of the three.\n\n However, note: the example input has more lanterns. The minimal d is determined by the worst-case condition.\n\n Therefore, the code:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n\n   # If there is only one lantern, then we have two conditions: left and right.\n   # But if n==0, we cannot do this, but n>=1.\n\n   # Condition 1: left end (from 0 to first lantern)\n   # Condition 2: right end (from last lantern to l)\n   # Condition 3: gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n   candidates = []\n   # Left end\n   if n == 0:\n       # According to the problem, n>=1, so skip.\n       pass\n   else:\n       candidates.append(a[0])   # for the left end: d >= a[0]\n       candidates.append(l - a[-1]) # for the right end: d >= (l - a[-1])\n\n   # Gaps\n   for i in range(1, n):\n       gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n       # The condition for this gap is that the two adjacent lanterns must cover the gap: d >= gap/2.0\n       # But note: the gap is the distance between two consecutive lanterns. The condition is that the two lanterns must meet in the middle, so half the gap.\n       candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n   # However, wait: in the gap condition, we are only considering the gap between consecutive lanterns. But note that the entire street might have multiple gaps, and we want the maximum required d for any gap.\n\n   # But wait, the above gap condition is for one gap. We should take the maximum gap/2.0.\n\n   # Actually, we are appending every gap's half to the candidates. Then we take the maximum candidate.\n\n   # But we can also compute the maximum gap separately.\n\n   # Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   # d_left = a[0]   # condition for the left end\n   # d_right = l - a[-1] # condition for the right end\n   # d_gap = 0\n   # for i in range(1, n):\n   #   gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n   #   if gap > d_gap * 2:   # actually, we care about gap/2, so we can store gap/2 and then take the maximum\n   #       d_gap = gap / 2.0\n\n   # Then answer = max(d_left, d_right, d_gap)\n\n   # However, note: in the above code, we appended each gap/2 to candidates, so then we take the maximum of all candidates.\n\n   # But wait: the left_end condition is a[0] (which is the entire distance from 0 to the first lantern) and the right_end condition is (l - a[-1]). However, the gap condition is (a[i]-a[i-1])/2.0.\n\n   # But is that correct for the gap condition? Consider two lanterns at positions x and y (x<y). The gap is (y-x). The condition is that the two lanterns must cover the entire gap. The first lantern at x must extend to at least y-d, but wait: actually, the two lanterns together must cover from x to y. The left lantern covers [x-d, x+d] and the right lantern covers [y-d, y+d]. The condition for the gap is that x+d >= y-d, i.e., d >= (y-x)/2.\n\n   # So yes, the condition for the gap is (y-x)/2.\n\n   # But note: the left_end condition is a[0] (the distance from the first lantern to 0). Similarly, the right_end condition is (l - a[-1]).\n\n   # However, wait: the left_end condition is actually the distance from the first lantern to 0, which is a[0]. But what if the first lantern is at 0? Then condition is 0. Similarly, if the first lantern is at a[0] and the next lantern is at a[1], then the gap condition is (a[1]-a[0])/2. The left_end condition is a[0] (which is the same as the gap condition if a[0] is the same as (a[1]-a[0])/2? Not necessarily.\n\n   # We are taking the maximum of all conditions.\n\n   # Now, we can write:\n\n   if n == 0:\n       print(0.0)\n   else:\n       # Compute left_end and right_end\n       left_end = a[0]\n       right_end = l - a[-1]\n\n       # Compute the maximum gap condition\n       gap_condition = 0.0\n       for i in range(1, n):\n           gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n           # The condition for this gap is gap/2.0, but note: if gap is 0, then condition is 0.\n           if gap_condition < gap / 2.0:\n               gap_condition = gap / 2.0\n\n       # The answer is the maximum of left_end, right_end, and gap_condition.\n       ans = max(left_end, right_end, gap_condition)\n\n       # Format the answer to have 9 decimal places.\n       print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\n However, wait: in the example [0,3,5,...] the gap_condition was 2.5 (from the gap 5 to 9: 5 units, so 2.5). But the left_end was 0 and the right_end was 0, so the answer was 2.5.\n\n But wait, what about the gap from 0 to 3? The condition for that gap is (3-0)/2=1.5. Then the gap_condition would be 2.5 (from the gap 5 to 9) and that is the maximum.\n\n However, note: the gap_condition is computed from the maximum of all gaps divided by 2. But the condition for the entire street is that the maximum of the three (left_end, right_end, and the maximum gap_condition) is the answer.\n\n But wait: the condition for the entire street is that the street is covered from 0 to l. The left_end condition (a[0]) is the minimal d required for the left end. The right_end condition (l - a[-1]) is the minimal d required for the right end. The gap_condition is the minimal d required for the largest gap.\n\n However, note: the condition for the left_end is that the first lantern must cover the left end (0). This condition is independent of the gaps. Similarly, the right_end condition is independent. The gaps are independent.\n\n But is that correct? Consider: if we have two lanterns at 0 and 10, and the street is from 0 to 20. Then:\n   left_end = 0\n   right_end = 10 (because 20-10=10)\n   gap_condition = (10-0)/2 = 5.\n\n   Then the answer is 10 (because 10 is the maximum). But wait, the condition for the right_end is 10, so d>=10. Then the first lantern (at 0) with d=10 covers [-10,10] and the second lantern (at 10) with d=10 covers [0,20]. So the entire street [0,20] is covered.\n\n But what if we set d=5? Then the first lantern covers [-5,5] and the second lantern covers [5,15]. Then the street from 0 to 20: \n   [0,5] is covered by the first lantern, [5,15] by the second, but [15,20] is not. So d=5 is insufficient.\n\n However, the condition for the right_end is 10, so we must have d>=10.\n\n But wait, why did we use the condition for the right_end as (l - a[-1])? Because the last lantern (at 10) must cover the point 20. The distance from 10 to 20 is 10, so d must be at least 10.\n\n Now, consider if we have two lanterns at 0 and 20, and the street is from 0 to 20. Then:\n   left_end = 0\n   right_end = 0 (because 20-20=0)\n   gap_condition = (20-0)/2 = 10.\n\n   Then the answer is 10.\n\n   Check: d=10, then the first lantern covers [-10,10] and the second lantern covers [10,30]. Then the entire street [0,20] is covered.\n\n But wait, the condition for the right_end is 0, so we don't require the last lantern to extend beyond 20? Actually, the last lantern at 20: to cover the point 20, we require d>=0, but the condition for the gap is 10. Then the answer is 10.\n\n However, note: the condition for the left_end is 0, so the first lantern must cover 0 (which it does with d=10). The condition for the gap is 10, so the two lanterns must meet: the first lantern goes to 10 and the second lantern starts at 10 (if d=10). So they meet at 10.\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait, what if the lanterns are not sorted? We sorted the list, so consecutive lanterns are in increasing order.\n\n However, note: the gap condition uses consecutive lanterns, and we sorted the list so that consecutive elements are adjacent on the street.\n\n One more edge: if the street is of length 0? The problem says l>=1, so no.\n\n Code:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n\n   # If there is only one lantern, then we still have the left and right conditions and no gap (so the gap_condition will be 0 from the for loop if n==1, but the for loop runs from 1 to n-1, so if n==1, the for loop doesn't run. Then we have to consider that.\n\n   left_end = a[0] if n > 0 else 0\n   right_end = l - a[-1] if n > 0 else 0\n\n   gap_condition = 0.0\n   if n > 1:\n       for i in range(1, n):\n           gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n           gap_condition = max(gap_condition, gap / 2.0)\n\n   # But wait, what if n==0? The problem states n>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   ans = max(left_end, right_end, gap_condition)\n\n   print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\n However, wait: the condition for the left_end is the entire distance from the first lantern to 0, which is a[0]. But what if the first lantern is at 0? Then left_end=0, which is correct.\n\n But wait: consider if the first lantern is at 0 and the street starts at 0, then the left_end condition is 0, meaning d>=0. Similarly, if the first lantern is at 0 and the next lantern is at 1, then the gap condition is (1-0)/2=0.5, so the answer would be max(0, (l - a[-1]), 0.5). \n\n Example: n=2, l=1, lanterns at [0,1]. Then:\n   left_end = 0\n   right_end = 1-1=0\n   gap_condition = (1-0)/2=0.5\n   ans = 0.5\n\n   Check: d=0.5. The first lantern (0) covers [-0.5,0.5] -> includes 0 and 0.5. The second lantern (1) covers [0.5,1.5] -> includes 1. The entire street [0,1] is covered because from 0 to 0.5 by the first lantern and from 0.5 to 1 by the second.\n\n   However, note the street goes to 1, and the second lantern at 1 must cover 1: d>=0, so that's okay.\n\n   But wait, the condition for the second lantern to cover 1 is that 1 <= 1+d, which is always true for d>=0.\n\n   But the entire street [0,1] is covered.\n\n   However, the condition for the gap is 0.5, and that is the minimal d.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: what if the lanterns are not distinct? The problem says multiple lanterns can be located at the same point.\n\n Example: n=2, l=10, lanterns at [5,5]. Then:\n   sorted: [5,5]\n   left_end = 5\n   right_end = 10-5=5\n   gap_condition = (5-5)/2=0.0\n   ans = 5.0\n\n   Check: d=5. The first lantern (5) covers [0,10] and the second lantern (5) also covers [0,10]. The entire street is covered.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left_end is 5, which is the distance from 5 to 0, so d>=5. Similarly for the right_end. The gap condition is 0, so the maximum is 5.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n However, wait: what if the lanterns are at the same point and that point is not the center? \n\n Example: n=2, l=10, lanterns at [0,0]. Then:\n   left_end = 0\n   right_end = 10-0=10\n   gap_condition = 0\n   ans = 10.0\n\n   Check: d=10. The first lantern (0) covers [-10,10] and the second lantern (0) also covers [-10,10]. The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   But wait, the condition for the left_end is 0, so the first lantern must cover 0 (which it does). The condition for the right_end is 10, so the last lantern must cover 10 (which requires d>=10). So correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   n, l = map(int, input().split())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   a.sort()\n\n   left_end = a[0]\n   right_end = l - a[-1]\n\n   gap_condition = 0.0\n   for i in range(1, n):\n       gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n       # If there's a gap, we need to consider the half of it\n       if gap > 0:   # if gap is 0, then condition is 0, so we can skip updating if we want, but 0 won't change the max.\n           gap_condition = max(gap_condition",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns to illuminate the entire street from point `0` to point `l`. The solution involves analyzing the positions of the lanterns and calculating the necessary `d` to cover the gaps between lanterns and the ends of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is represented as a line segment from `0` to `l`, with `n` lanterns placed at specific positions. Each lantern illuminates all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The first lantern must extend its light far enough to cover the start of the street (point `0`). The required `d` here is the distance from the first lantern to `0`.\n   - **Right End Coverage**: Similarly, the last lantern must cover the end of the street (point `l`). The required `d` here is the distance from the last lantern to `l`.\n   - **Gap Coverage**: For any two consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined light. The minimal `d` required for each gap is half the distance between the two lanterns.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the lantern positions to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n   - Calculate the minimal `d` required for the left end, right end, and all gaps between lanterns.\n   - The overall minimal `d` is the maximum value among these individual requirements, ensuring all parts of the street are covered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    left_end = a[0]\n    right_end = l - a[-1]\n    \n    gap_condition = 0.0\n    if n > 1:\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            gap_condition = max(gap_condition, gap / 2.0)\n    \n    ans = max(left_end, right_end, gap_condition)\n    print(\"{:.9f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in order along the street.\n3. **Left and Right End Conditions**: The distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (`left_end`) and from the last lantern to the end of the street (`right_end`) are calculated. These values directly give the minimal `d` needed for the ends.\n4. **Gap Conditions**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them is divided by 2 to find the minimal `d` required to cover that gap. The largest such value across all gaps is stored in `gap_condition`.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the maximum value among `left_end`, `right_end`, and `gap_condition`, ensuring all parts of the street are illuminated. The result is printed with a precision of 9 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all critical segments of the street (ends and gaps between lanterns) to determine the minimal light radius required, ensuring optimal coverage with the least possible `d`.",
