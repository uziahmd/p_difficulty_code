There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m and then m lines of restrictions [l_i, r_i, x_i]\n Since n, m, h are at most 50, we can use dynamic programming or try to assign heights satisfying all constraints.\n\n However, note: the profit function is a^2 for each house. The goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\n The challenge is that the restrictions impose that in some intervals the maximum height is bounded by x_i.\n\n Observation:\n Since the constraints are independent and the objective is separable (each house's profit depends only on its own height),\n we can think of assigning a height a_i for each spot i (from 0 to h) such that for every restriction (l, r, x): \n   max{ a_i for i in [l, r] } <= x.\n\n But note: we have multiple restrictions that might overlap. The key is that the restrictions must be satisfied simultaneously.\n\n We can consider the following:\n\n 1. The entire street has an overall maximum height h, but restrictions may lower the allowed height in certain areas.\n\n 2. We need to assign a height for each spot, but the same house must satisfy all restrictions that cover it.\n\n 3. For a given spot i, the maximum height we can assign is the minimum between h and the minimum x from all restrictions that cover i.\n\n However, wait: this is not entirely correct. Consider two restrictions:\n    Restriction A: [1,3] with x=2\n    Restriction B: [2,4] with x=3\n\n Then for spot 2: the restrictions say that the tallest in [1,3] must be <=2 and the tallest in [2,4] must be <=3.\n But note: the first restriction already forces the house at spot 2 to be at most 2 (since if spot2 is 3, then the max in [1,3] would be 3 which violates the first restriction).\n\n However, what if we set spot2 to 2? Then both restrictions are satisfied.\n\n So for each spot i, we must ensure that the height a_i does not exceed the minimum x value from any restriction that covers i.\n\n But wait: is that sufficient? Actually, no. Because the restrictions are about the entire interval. The condition for a restriction (l, r, x) is that the maximum height in [l, r] is <= x.\n\n If we set every house i to the minimum x among restrictions covering i (and also not exceeding h), then in the interval [l, r] the maximum height would be the maximum of the minimum x's in that interval? Not necessarily.\n\n Example: \n    Restriction1: [1,3] with x=2\n    Restriction2: [2,3] with x=3\n\n For spot1: only restriction1 -> min_x=2\n For spot2: min(2,3)=2\n For spot3: min(2,3)=2\n\n Then the entire interval [1,3] would have maximum 2, which is <=2 (restriction1). And [2,3] has maximum 2<=3. So it works.\n\n However, consider:\n    Restriction1: [1,2] with x=2\n    Restriction2: [2,3] with x=1\n\n Then:\n    Spot1: min_x=2\n    Spot2: min(2,1)=1\n    Spot3: min_x=1\n\n Now check restriction1: [1,2] -> max(2,1)=2 -> satisfies restriction1 (<=2)\n restriction2: [2,3] -> max(1,1)=1 -> satisfies restriction2.\n\n But now, what if we have:\n    Restriction1: [1,2] with x=2\n    Restriction2: [1,3] with x=1\n\n Then:\n    Spot1: min(2,1)=1\n    Spot2: min(2,1)=1\n    Spot3: min(1)=1\n\n Then [1,2]: max=1<=2 -> ok, [1,3]: max=1<=1 -> ok.\n\n But now, consider a more complex example:\n\n    Restriction1: [1,3] with x=2\n    Restriction2: [1,2] with x=3\n    Restriction3: [2,3] with x=1\n\n Then:\n    Spot1: min(2,3)=2\n    Spot2: min(2,3,1)=1\n    Spot3: min(2,1)=1\n\n Check restrictions:\n    Restriction1: [1,3] -> max(2,1,1)=2 <=2 -> ok.\n    Restriction2: [1,2] -> max(2,1)=2 <=3 -> ok.\n    Restriction3: [2,3] -> max(1,1)=1 <=1 -> ok.\n\n So the idea is: for each spot i, let M(i) = min{ x_j for each restriction j such that [l_j, r_j] covers i } (if there are no restrictions, then M(i)=h).\n\n However, note: the problem says that the maximum height of a house is h (so we cannot exceed h). So actually, the effective maximum for spot i is min(h, M(i)).\n\n But wait: is that always sufficient? \n\n Let's define for each spot i: a_i = min(h, M(i))\n\n Then, does this assignment satisfy all restrictions?\n For a restriction (l, r, x): we require that the maximum a_j for j in [l, r] is <= x.\n\n But note: for any j in [l, r], we have a_j <= M(j) (because a_j = min(h, M(j)) and M(j) is the minimum x from restrictions covering j). However, note that M(j) might be defined by a restriction that is not this one. \n\n Moreover, note that M(j) for a spot j is the minimum x among restrictions that cover j. But the restriction (l, r, x) requires that the maximum over [l, r] is <= x. \n\n However, consider: if we set a_j = min(h, M(j)), then for the restriction (l, r, x) we have that each a_j in [l, r] is <= M(j) (which is at least as large as the x of this restriction? Not necessarily). \n\n Actually, M(j) is the minimum of x from all restrictions covering j. Therefore, if a restriction (l, r, x) covers j, then M(j) <= x. But wait: no, because M(j) is the minimum of ALL restrictions that cover j, including possibly ones that are more restrictive. \n\n However, note: the restriction (l, r, x) is one of the restrictions that might cover j. Then M(j) <= x. So a_j = min(h, M(j)) <= x. Therefore, for every j in [l, r], a_j <= x. Hence the maximum in [l, r] is <= x.\n\n Therefore, the assignment a_i = min(h, M(i)) for each spot i satisfies all restrictions.\n\n But is this the maximum profit?\n\n Since the profit for a house is a_i^2, and we are allowed to set the height arbitrarily (as long as the restrictions are satisfied) and the function a^2 is increasing in a (for a>=0), we want to set each house as high as possible.\n\n However, note: we cannot set a house higher than the effective maximum (min(h, M(i))). So the above assignment is the maximum we can set for each house independently.\n\n Then the profit would be sum_{i=1}^{n} [min(h, M(i))]^2.\n\n But wait: what if we set a house lower than the effective maximum? Would that allow us to set a neighboring house higher and still satisfy the restrictions? \n\n Let me clarify: The restrictions are global. The effective maximum for a house i is determined by the minimum x from all restrictions that cover i. If we set a house below that, then we are not using the maximum allowed. However, sometimes setting a house lower might relax the constraints on other houses? \n\n Example: \n    Two houses and two restrictions:\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x=1\n        Restriction2: [1,2] with x=2\n\n    Then M(1)=min(1,2)=1, M(2)=min(1,2)=1. So we set both to 1 and profit=1+1=2.\n\n    But what if we set house1 to 0? Then the maximum in [1,2] is house2. We can set house2 to 2? Then the maximum in [1,2] is 2, which violates the first restriction (x=1). \n\n    Alternatively, set house1 to 0 and house2 to 1: then profit=0+1=1, which is worse.\n\n    Another example: \n        Two houses, two restrictions:\n            Restriction1: [1,1] with x=1\n            Restriction2: [2,2] with x=2\n            Restriction3: [1,2] with x=0\n\n        Then M(1)=min(1,0)=0, M(2)=min(2,0)=0. So we set both to 0, profit=0.\n\n        But if we set house1 to 0 and house2 to 0, then the restriction [1,2] (x=0) is satisfied. \n\n    Now consider without the third restriction:\n            Restriction1: [1,1] with x=1\n            Restriction2: [2,2] with x=2\n\n        Then M(1)=1, M(2)=2. Then profit=1^2+2^2=5.\n\n    But note: the two restrictions are independent. There is no restriction that forces the entire interval [1,2] to be low. So we set house1 to 1 and house2 to 2, which is valid.\n\n    Now, what if we have overlapping restrictions that might allow a trade-off? \n\n    Example from the first sample:\n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n        Then:\n          M(1)=min(1)=1 -> height=1\n          M(2)=min(3)=3 -> height=3\n          M(3)=min(2)=2 -> height=2\n        Profit=1+9+4=14.\n\n    The sample output is 14.\n\n    Second sample:\n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n        Then:\n          M(1)=min(no restriction? Actually, we have two restrictions: [2,3] and [3,4]. So spot1: no restriction -> so we use h=10.\n          M(2)=min(8)=8\n          M(3)=min(8,7)=7\n          M(4)=min(7)=7\n\n        Then profit=10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2=100+64+49+49=262.\n\n    But wait: the sample input says two restrictions: [2,3] and [3,4]. So:\n        Spot1: no restriction -> effective max = min(10, ... ) but we haven't defined M(1). How do we compute M(1)?\n\n    We must consider that if there is no restriction covering spot1, then M(1) should be set to something very large (so that min(h, M(1)) becomes h). \n\n    However, our definition: M(i) = min{ x_j for each restriction j such that [l_j, r_j] covers i }.\n\n    For a spot i not covered by any restriction, we don't have any x_j, so the min over an empty set is undefined. We can set M(i)=h (the overall maximum) but wait: the problem says the maximum height is h. So without any restriction, the house can be at most h.\n\n    However, note: the overall maximum is h, and the restrictions are additional. Without any restriction, we can set up to h.\n\n    But in our formula, if we define M(i) as the minimum of the x's from the restrictions that cover i, then for an uncovered spot we don't have any x to take the min of. We can set M(i) = h (because if we set M(i)=h, then min(h, h)=h, which is correct). \n\n    Alternatively, we can set M(i) = min( {x_j for j in restrictions covering i} ) if the set is non-empty, otherwise h. But note: the problem says the house can be built with height between 0 and h. So without restrictions, we can set to h.\n\n    However, let me reexamine: the restrictions are the only constraints. The base maximum is h. The restrictions might lower the maximum. So we can define:\n\n        M(i) = min( {x_j for j in restrictions if l_j<=i<=r_j} )   [if the set is non-empty, then we take the min; if empty, then we don't have any constraint from the restrictions, so we can go up to h]\n\n    Then the effective maximum for house i is min(h, M(i))? Actually, if M(i) is taken from the restrictions and we set M(i)=min(...), then if there are no restrictions, we don't take any min? \n\n    We can define M(i) as follows: \n        Let R(i) = { x_j | restriction j: l_j<=i<=r_j }\n        Then M(i) = min(R(i)) if R(i) is non-empty, else h.\n\n    Then the effective maximum is min(h, M(i)) = M(i) if R(i) non-empty, and h if empty. But note: if R(i) is non-empty and we set M(i)=min(R(i)), then the effective maximum is min(h, M(i)) = min(h, min(R(i))). However, if R(i) is non-empty, then we must have min(R(i)) <= h? Not necessarily: the problem says 0<=x_i<=h, so yes, but then min(R(i)) is at most h. So min(h, M(i)) is just M(i) when we have restrictions, and h when we don't.\n\n    Alternatively, we can define M(i) as the minimum between h and the min of the x_j from the restrictions that cover i. But wait, if a restriction gives x_j that is greater than h, then we don't need to worry because h is the absolute maximum. However, the input says 0<=x_i<=h, so x_j is at most h.\n\n    Therefore, we can simply set:\n\n        M(i) = min( {x_j for j in range(m) if l_j<=i<=r_j} )   [if the set is empty, then we set M(i) = h]\n\n    Then the effective maximum for house i is M(i) (because M(i) <= h).\n\n    Then the profit for house i is M(i)^2.\n\n    But wait: is that the maximum? Since the function is increasing, we want to set each house to the maximum allowed, which is M(i). \n\n    However, consider: what if the restrictions interact in a way that we can set a house higher than M(i) if we lower an adjacent house? \n\n    Example: \n        Two houses and two restrictions:\n            Restriction1: [1,2] with x=1\n            Restriction2: [1,2] with x=2\n\n        Then M(1)=min(1,2)=1, M(2)=min(1,2)=1. So we set both to 1, profit=1+1=2.\n\n        But what if we set house1 to 0? Then the restriction1 [1,2] would require that the maximum is <=1, but house2 can be set to 1 (so max=1) -> valid, but profit=0+1=1, which is worse.\n\n        Another example: \n            Two houses, three restrictions:\n                Restriction1: [1,1] with x=1\n                Restriction2: [2,2] with x=2\n                Restriction3: [1,2] with x=0\n\n            Then M(1)=min(1,0)=0, M(2)=min(2,0)=0. So we set both to 0, profit=0.\n\n        Now, without the third restriction, we set house1 to 1 and house2 to 2, profit=5.\n\n        But what if we have two restrictions that are conflicting but not overlapping the entire set?\n\n        Example: \n            Two houses, two restrictions:\n                Restriction1: [1,1] with x=2\n                Restriction2: [2,2] with x=1\n                Restriction3: [1,2] with x=1\n\n            Then M(1)=min(2,1)=1, M(2)=min(1,1)=1. So profit=1+1=2.\n\n        But without the third restriction, we could set house1 to 2 and house2 to 1 (profit=4+1=5). The third restriction forces the maximum in [1,2] to be <=1, so we cannot set house1 to 2.\n\n        Therefore, the assignment M(i) is the maximum allowed for house i and we must set it to M(i) to get the maximum profit.\n\n    However, wait: what if we set a house to less than M(i)? Then we might relax the constraints for the entire interval? \n\n    Let me think: the constraint for an interval is that the maximum in that interval must be <= x. The assignment M(i) for each house i is the minimal x that appears in any restriction covering i. Then the maximum in any interval must be <= the minimum x in the restrictions that cover that interval? \n\n    Actually, we must ensure that for every restriction j: the maximum in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j.\n\n    In our assignment, for each house i, we set a_i = M(i). Now, consider a restriction j: [l_j, r_j] with x_j. For any house i in [l_j, r_j], we have M(i) <= x_j? \n\n        Since i is in [l_j, r_j], then by definition, x_j is one of the values in the set used to compute M(i). Therefore, M(i) = min( ... , x_j, ...) <= x_j.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum in [l_j, r_j] is at most max_{i in [l_j, r_j]} M(i) <= x_j (because each M(i) <= x_j, so the maximum is <= x_j). \n\n    But note: the maximum in [l_j, r_j] might be less than x_j, but that's okay.\n\n    However, is it necessary to set every house to M(i)? \n\n    Since the profit function is increasing, we want to set each house as high as possible. The constraint for house i is that it must be <= M(i). But note: if we set a house to less than M(i), then we are leaving potential profit on the table. Unless there is a constraint that we are breaking by having a high house elsewhere? \n\n    But observe: the restrictions are defined by intervals. The only constraints are that in each interval [l_j, r_j] the maximum is <= x_j. Since we set every house i to M(i) and we know that M(i) is the minimum x_j for which i is in [l_j, r_j], then if we set a house to a value less than M(i), we are not violating any constraint. However, we are reducing the profit.\n\n    Therefore, the optimal solution is to set each house i to M(i).\n\n    But wait: what if two restrictions force two different constraints on the same house, and we set the house to the minimum of the two, but then in an interval that contains this house and others, the maximum might become too high because of a neighboring house? \n\n    Example: \n        Three houses, two restrictions:\n            Restriction1: [1,3] with x=2\n            Restriction2: [2,2] with x=3\n\n        Then:\n            M(1)=min(2)=2\n            M(2)=min(2,3)=2\n            M(3)=min(2)=2\n\n        Then the assignment is [2,2,2]. The entire interval [1,3] has max=2<=2, and [2,2] has max=2<=3 -> valid.\n\n        What if we set house2 to 3? Then the assignment would be [2,3,2]. Then [1,3] has max=3 which violates restriction1 (x=2). So we cannot set house2 to 3.\n\n        But wait, our M(2)=2, so we set it to 2. That is correct.\n\n    Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        Step1: Read n, h, m.\n        Step2: For each of the m restrictions, store (l, r, x).\n        Step3: For each spot i from 1 to n:\n                Let S_i = { x_j for each restriction j such that l_j <= i <= r_j }\n                Then M(i) = min(S_i) if S_i is non-empty, else h.\n\n                Then the height for spot i is M(i).\n\n        Step4: Compute profit = sum_{i=1}^{n} (M(i))^2.\n\n    However, wait: what if we have a restriction that doesn't cover the entire street? \n\n    Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n    Example 1: \n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Restrictions: [1,1,1], [2,2,3], [3,3,2]\n\n        i=1: S_1 = {1} -> M(1)=1\n        i=2: S_2 = {3} -> M(2)=3\n        i=3: S_3 = {2} -> M(3)=2\n\n        Profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4 = 14. Correct.\n\n    Example 2:\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        Restrictions: [2,3,8], [3,4,7]\n\n        i=1: no restriction -> M(1)=10\n        i=2: S_2={8} -> M(2)=8\n        i=3: S_3={8,7} -> M(3)=7\n        i=4: S_4={7} -> M(4)=7\n\n        Profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262. Correct.\n\n    But wait, what if the same house is constrained by multiple restrictions and the minimum x is the same? It doesn't matter.\n\n    However, consider a case where the same house is constrained by two different restrictions with the same x: that's okay.\n\n    But what if we have multiple restrictions that don't cover the entire street? \n\n    Example: \n        n=3, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [2,3] with x=6\n\n        Then:\n            i=1: {5} -> 5\n            i=2: {5,6} -> 5\n            i=3: {6} -> 6\n\n        Profit = 5^2+5^2+6^2 = 25+25+36 = 86.\n\n        Now, is that valid?\n            Restriction1: [1,2] -> max(5,5)=5<=5 -> ok.\n            Restriction2: [2,3] -> max(5,6)=6<=6 -> ok.\n\n    One more example: \n        n=3, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,3] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [1,2] with x=6\n\n        Then:\n            i=1: min(5,6)=5\n            i=2: min(5,6)=5\n            i=3: min(5)=5\n\n        Profit = 5^2*3 = 75.\n\n        Check: \n            Restriction1: [1,3] -> max=5<=5 -> ok.\n            Restriction2: [1,2] -> max=5<=6 -> ok.\n\n    Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n    However, note: the problem statement says the maximum height is h. Our method sets the house to M(i) which is at most h (because if there is a restriction, x_i<=h, and if there isn't, we set to h). So we never exceed h.\n\n    Code:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        restrictions = []\n        for _ in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n            restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\n        # Create an array for M for each spot from 1 to n\n        M_arr = [0] * (n+1)   # index from 1 to n\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            # Collect all x from restrictions that cover i\n            candidate = []   # will collect x values for restrictions that cover i\n            for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n                if l <= i <= r:\n                    candidate.append(x)\n\n            if candidate:\n                M_arr[i] = min(candidate)\n            else:\n                M_arr[i] = h\n\n        profit = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            profit += M_arr[i] * M_arr[i]\n\n        print(profit)\n\n    But wait: what if we have no restrictions? Then for each i, candidate is empty -> set to h. Then profit = n * h^2.\n\n    Example: n=1, h=10, m=0 -> profit=100.\n\n    This matches: we can build a house of height 10 and get 100.\n\n    However, wait: the problem says the maximum height is h, and there are no restrictions. So yes.\n\n    But consider: what if we have two restrictions that are the same? \n\n    Example: \n        n=1, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [1,1] with x=5\n\n        Then candidate = [5,5] -> min=5. Then profit=5^2=25.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    However, note: the problem says that the restrictions are given and we must satisfy all. So if two restrictions give the same x, then we are forced to 5.\n\n    But wait: what if we have two restrictions that give different x's? \n\n    Example: \n        n=1, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [1,1] with x=7\n\n        Then candidate=[5,7] -> min=5. So we set to 5.\n\n    But note: the second restriction allows up to 7, but the first restricts to 5. So the house must be <=5.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    However, wait: the problem says the restrictions are independent and we must satisfy all. The above method sets each house to the minimal x from all restrictions that cover it. This is the tightest constraint.\n\n    Let me run the provided examples again.\n\n    Example1: \n        Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n        Output: 14\n\n    Example2: \n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n        Output: 262\n\n    The code produces these outputs.\n\n    But wait: what if the same house is constrained by two restrictions with different x's, but one of them is not the minimal? \n\n    Example: \n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [1,2] with x=10\n\n        Then for i=1: candidate=[5,10] -> min=5\n        i=2: candidate=[5,10] -> min=5\n        Profit = 5^2+5^2=50.\n\n        Check: \n            Restriction1: [1,2] -> max=5<=5 -> ok.\n            Restriction2: [1,2] -> max=5<=10 -> ok.\n\n    But note: the second restriction is redundant.\n\n    Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\n    However, wait: what if the same house is constrained by two restrictions that are not the same, and we set it to the minimum, but then an interval that includes this house and others is broken because the minimum of the two restrictions is too low? \n\n    Example: \n        n=3, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,3] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [2,2] with x=10\n\n        Then:\n            i=1: {5} -> 5\n            i=2: {5,10} -> 5\n            i=3: {5} -> 5\n\n        Profit = 5^2*3 = 75.\n\n        Check: \n            Restriction1: [1,3] -> max=5<=5 -> ok.\n            Restriction2: [2,2] -> max=5<=10 -> ok.\n\n    It's okay.\n\n    But consider: \n        n=3, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,3] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [1,2] with x=10\n\n        Then:\n            i=1: {5,10} -> 5\n            i=2: {5,10} -> 5\n            i=3: {5} -> 5\n\n        Same result.\n\n    But what if the two restrictions are on different parts and the minimal constraint is from one that is not the overall minimal? \n\n    Example: \n        n=3, h=10, m=3\n        Restriction1: [1,1] with x=5\n        Restriction2: [2,2] with x=10\n        Restriction3: [3,3] with x=15   [but note: x is at most h, so 15 is not allowed. Actually, x<=h, so let x=10 for restriction3]\n\n        Then:\n            i=1: {5} -> 5\n            i=2: {10} -> 10\n            i=3: {10} -> 10\n\n        Profit = 25+100+100=225.\n\n        Check: \n            Restriction1: [1,1] -> 5<=5 -> ok.\n            Restriction2: [2,2] -> 10<=10 -> ok.\n            Restriction3: [3,3] -> 10<=10 -> ok.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    However, note: the problem states that the maximum height is h, and the restrictions' x_i are between 0 and h. So we don't need to worry about x_i > h.\n\n    Therefore, the code is as follows.\n\n    But wait: the problem says the input x_i is between 0 and h. So we are safe.\n\n    However, there is a catch: what if a restriction has x_i=0? Then the house must be 0.\n\n    Example: \n        n=1, h=10, m=1\n        Restriction: [1,1] with x=0\n\n        Then M(1)=0, profit=0.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    But note: the profit function is a^2, and a=0 gives 0.\n\n    However, we must consider that the house can be built with height 0, which is allowed.\n\n    Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n        restrictions = []\n        for i in range(m):\n            data = input().split()\n            l, r, x = map(int, data)\n            restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\n        # Build an array for the effective maximum for each spot\n        M_arr = [0]*(n+1)   # 0-indexed, we'll use indices 1..n\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            # Go through each restriction and check if it covers i\n            min_val = h   # start with the overall maximum h, then if we find a restriction, we take the min of the found x's\n            found = False\n            for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n                if l <= i <= r:\n                    if x < min_val:\n                        min_val = x\n                    found = True\n\n            # If we found at least one restriction, then we use min_val, else we use h (which is the initial value and found remains False)\n            M_arr[i] = min_val\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            total += M_arr[i] ** 2\n\n        print(total)\n\n    But note: the above loop for each spot i goes through all m restrictions. Since n, m <=50, this is acceptable (at most 50*50=2500 operations).\n\n    Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n    Example1: \n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Restrictions: (1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2)\n\n        i=1: \n            (1,1,1): 1<=1<=1 -> update min_val=min(3,1)=1\n            (2,2,3): 2<=1<=2 -> false\n            (3,3,2): 3<=1<=3 -> false -> so M_arr[1]=1\n\n        i=2:\n            (1,1,1): 1<=2<=1 -> false\n            (2,2,3): 2<=2<=2 -> update min_val=min(3,3)=3 (but initially min_val=3, so remains 3)\n            (3,3,2): 3<=2<=3 -> false -> M_arr[2]=3\n\n        i=3:\n            (1,1,1): false\n            (2,2,3): false\n            (3,3,2): true -> update min_val=min(3,2)=2 -> M_arr[3]=2\n\n        Profit=1+9+4=14.\n\n    Example2:\n        n=4, h=10, m=2\n        Restrictions: (2,3,8), (3,4,7)\n\n        i=1: no restriction -> min_val=10 (initially set to h=10, and no update) -> 10\n        i=2: (2,3,8): 2<=2<=3 -> update min_val=min(10,8)=8 -> then (3,4,7): 3<=2<=4 -> false -> 8\n        i=3: (2,3,8): update min_val=min(10,8)=8 -> then (3,4,7): update min_val=min(8,7)=7 -> 7\n        i=4: (2,3,8): 2<=4<=3 -> false -> (3,4,7): update min_val=min(10,7)=7 -> 7\n\n        Profit=10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2=100+64+49+49=262.\n\n    This matches.\n\n    However, note: the initial min_val is set to h. Then we update only if we find a restriction. This is equivalent to:\n\n        M(i) = min( {x_j for j in restrictions if i in [l_j, r_j]} )   if the set is non-empty, else h.\n\n    But wait, if we set the initial min_val to h, then even if we find a restriction with x_j > h, we don't update? But the problem says 0<=x_j<=h, so x_j<=h. Therefore, we are safe.\n\n    But what if we set the initial min_val to a very large number? Then we could update with x_j and then take the minimum. The current method uses h as the initial, which is the maximum allowed. Then we update with the actual x_j's (which are <=h) and then the result is the minimum x_j found, or h if none.\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    However, there's a nuance: if we set the initial min_val to h, then if we find a restriction with x_j = h, then min_val remains h. That is okay.\n\n    Therefore, we can write the code as above.\n\n    But note: the problem says the input x_i can",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The key challenge is to ensure that the height of each house does not violate any of the given restrictions, which specify that the tallest house in certain intervals must not exceed a specified maximum height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the optimal height for each house such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction dictates that within a specific interval, the maximum house height must not exceed a given value. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the squares of the house heights.\n\n2. **Insight**: For each house at position `i`, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive restriction that includes this position. Specifically, it is the minimum value among all `x_i` from restrictions covering position `i`. If no restrictions cover a position, the maximum height allowed is the global maximum `h`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - For each position from 1 to `n`, collect all `x_i` values from restrictions that include this position.\n   - The effective maximum height for the position is the minimum of these collected `x_i` values. If no restrictions apply, the height is set to `h`.\n   - The profit is then calculated by summing the squares of these effective maximum heights for all positions.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each position and checks all `m` restrictions for each position. With `n` and `m` both up to 50, the total operations are manageable (up to 2500), making the solution efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    restrictions = []\n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        x_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        restrictions.append((l, r, x_val))\n    \n    M_arr = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        min_val = h\n        for (l, r, x_val) in restrictions:\n            if l <= i <= r:\n                if x_val < min_val:\n                    min_val = x_val\n        M_arr[i] = min_val\n    \n    total_profit = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total_profit += M_arr[i] ** 2\n        \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first three values are `n` (number of spots), `h` (maximum height), and `m` (number of restrictions). The subsequent lines contain the restrictions themselves.\n\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each spot from 1 to `n`, the algorithm checks all restrictions to find the minimum `x_i` value among those that include the current spot. This minimum value becomes the effective maximum height for that spot.\n\n3. **Calculating Profit**: The profit is computed by summing the squares of the effective maximum heights for all spots. This approach ensures that all zoning restrictions are satisfied while maximizing the total profit.\n\n4. **Output**: The total profit is printed, which is the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints by leveraging simple iteration and min-value checks, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
