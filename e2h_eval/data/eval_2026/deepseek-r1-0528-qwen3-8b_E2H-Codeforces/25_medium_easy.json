При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string `t` and we need to check if it can be formed by taking two copies of some string `s` (with the same length) and then overlapping them at least once (but not completely, meaning the overlap must be positive and less than the entire message). However, note that the problem says: \n \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений.\" \n This means that if the entire second message is overlapped (so t is exactly two copies of s with the entire second copy overlapping the first), then that is not considered an error. But note the example: \n   Input: \"abcabc\" -> Output: \"NO\"\n\n Actually, the problem states:\n   - If the entire message is just two copies without any proper overlap (like \"abcabc\") then it is considered no error.\n\n However, the example output for \"abcabc\" is \"NO\", meaning that we must not consider that as an error.\n\n The idea is: \n   We are to check if there exists a non-empty string s such that:\n      t = s + s   [without any overlap?] but wait, the problem allows an overlap of positive length (but not the whole second s).\n\n But note: the example says that if we get \"abcd\", no error. And \"abcabc\" is also no error.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   \"Ошибки может произойти только при передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд\", meaning that the original two messages were the same and each was of length |s|, and the total string is built from two copies of s, but with an overlap (which is a positive number and less than |s|? Actually, the problem says \"меньшим длины текста сообщения\", meaning the overlap is less than the length of the entire message? But wait, the example: \n        \"abrakadabra\" (length 11) and then another \"abrakadabra\", and they can be overlapped by 1 or 4.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения.\" \n But note: the text of the message is the entire message? Or the message itself? The message is s, so the length of s is n, then the overlap must be less than n? \n\n However, the example: \"abrakadabra\" has length 11. Then the overlap is 1 or 4, which are both less than 11.\n\n But note: the example output for 'acacacaca' is 'YES\\nacaca'. \n   Let s = \"acaca\", then two copies: \"acacaacaca\". Now, if we overlap by 2, then we get:\n        First part: \"acaca\"\n        Second part: \"acaca\" -> but when overlapping, we align the next two characters: \n            Without overlap: \"acacaacaca\"\n            With overlap 2: we take the first 5-2=3 characters of the second s and append? Actually, the problem says: \n                \"конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго\"\n\n So the resulting string would be: s[0: n - overlap] + s[overlap:] ... wait, let me clarify:\n\n Actually, the process: \n   We have two identical messages s. When sending, if there's an error, the second message starts being merged from the end of the first. The merging continues until a mismatch or until the entire second message is merged.\n\n Example: \n   s = \"abrakadabra\", n = 11.\n   Case 1: overlap 1 -> then the second message starts at the last character of the first? Actually, the merging condition is that the overlapping part must be identical.\n\n   So, the first message is s[0:11] and the second is s[0:11]. When merging, we require that the suffix of the first message (of length L) is equal to the prefix of the second (of length L). Then the merged string is s[0:11-L] + s[L:11] + s[0:L]? \n\n   Actually, wait: the problem says the entire two messages are sent, but when there's an error, they merge. The merged result is:\n        t = s[0: n] + s[L:]   but wait, actually the merging doesn't duplicate the overlapping part. \n\n   Example: \n        s = \"abc\", and if we have an overlap of 1: \n            Without error: \"absc\" (if we had two messages) but wait, the two messages are the same. Actually, the problem says two identical messages. \n\n   Let me re-read: \"two identical messages\" and then they are merged. The merged message is: \n        We have the first message: s[0:n]\n        Then the second message: s[0:n], but we start merging from the end of the first and the beginning of the second. \n\n   The merging condition: we can only merge if the last L characters of the first message equal the first L characters of the second. Then the resulting string is:\n        s[0:n] + s[L:n]   but wait, that would be the same as s[0:n] + s[L:n] = s[0:n] + s[L:n] = the original two without the overlapping part duplicated.\n\n   Actually, the example: \n        \"abrakadabra\" (first message) and then \"abrakadabra\" (second message) with an overlap of 1: \n            Result: \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" -> wait, how?\n            Without error: we would have \"abrakadabraabrakadabra\" (length 22)\n            With error and overlap 1: \n                The first message is \"abrakadabra\", then the second message starts with 'a' which matches the last 'a' of the first? \n                Then the merged string is: \"abrakadabra\" (the first) and then the remaining part of the second message (without the first character) appended: \"brakadabra\", so we get \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n   Similarly, for overlap 4: \n        The first message is \"abrakadabra\", then the second message's first 4 letters \"abra\" match the last 4 of the first message? \n        The first message ends with \"a\" (last char) -> wait, the last four of \"abrakadabra\" are \"abra\"? \n            a b r a k a d a b r a -> the last four: 'bra' (if we take last four: from index 7 to 10: 'd','a','b','r','a'? Actually, the last four: \n            indices: 0-indexed: \n                s[0]='a', s[1]='b', s[2]='r', s[3]='a', s[4]='k', s[5]='a', s[6]='d', s[7]='a', s[8]='b', s[9]='r', s[10]='a'\n            The last four: s[7:11] = \"abra\" -> yes, so we can overlap 4.\n\n        Then the merged string: \n            Take the first 11-4 = 7 characters of the first message: \"abrakad\" and then the rest of the second message: s[4:11] = \"dabra\" (wait, that doesn't seem right). \n\n        Alternatively, the merged string should be: \n            The entire first message (11 chars) and then the second message without the overlapping part (which is 4) -> so we remove the first 4 of the second message and append the rest? \n            Then the string would be: \"abrakadabra\" (first) and then \"dabra\" (from the second) -> \"abrakadarabradabra\"? \n\n        Actually, the example says the result is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" or \"abrakadabrakadabra\".\n\n        Let me break down the example with overlap 4:\n\n        First message: \"abrakadabra\"\n        Second message: \"abrakadabra\"\n\n        We overlap by 4, meaning the last 4 of the first and the first 4 of the second must be equal. They are \"abra\" and \"abra\" -> equal.\n\n        Then the resulting string is: \n            We write the first message entirely: \"abrakadabra\"\n            Then we write the second message without the overlapping part: so we skip the first 4 and then write the rest: \"dabra\"\n\n        So the full string: \"abrakadabra\" + \"dabra\" = \"abrakadarabradabra\"? \n\n        But the example says one possibility is \"abrakadabrakadabra\". \n\n        Let me check: \n            \"abrakadabrakadabra\": \n                The first message is \"abrakadabra\", then the second message is \"abrakadabra\", but wait, that doesn't look like it skipped the first 4.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe the merging is done by taking the first message and then appending the second message from the point after the overlap? \n\n        Actually, the example output says: \n            Input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' and 'abrakadabrakadabra'\n\n        How did they get \"abrakadabrakadabra\"?\n\n        Let me see: \n            First message: \"abrakadabra\"\n            Second message: \"abrakadabra\"\n\n        What if the overlap is 8? Then the last 8 of the first must equal the first 8 of the second. The last 8 of \"abrakadabra\": \n            s[2:11] = \"rakadabra\" -> wait, that's 9 characters from index2 to index10: \"rakadabra\" (9 chars). \n\n        Alternatively, the example says two possibilities: \n            Possibility 1: overlap 1 -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n            Possibility 2: overlap 4 -> \"abrakadabrakadabra\"\n\n        Let me reconstruct possibility 2:\n\n        Possibility 2: \n            First message: \"abrakadabra\"\n            Second message: \"abrakadabra\"\n\n        If we overlap by 4, we take the first 4 of the second message to match the last 4 of the first. Then the merged string is:\n            s[0:11-4] + s[4:11] + s[0:4] ??? \n\n        That would be: \n            s[0:7] = \"abrakad\", then s[4:11] = \"kadabra\", then s[0:4] = \"abra\" -> \"abrakadkadabraabra\" -> that's not matching.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be defining the merged string as: \n            t = s + s[L:]   where L is the overlap.\n\n        Then for L=4: \n            s + s[4:] = \"abrakadabra\" + \"dabra\" = \"abrakadarabradabra\" -> which is 15 characters, but the example says one of the results is \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (which is 15 too? Let me count: \n                \"abrakadabrakadabra\": \n                    a b r a k a d a b r a k a d a b r a -> wait, actually: \n                    a b r a k a d a b r a k a d a b r a -> 18 characters.\n\n        Wait, the example input was \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", which is 22 characters? \n\n        Let me count: \n            \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\": \n                a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a -> 21 characters.\n\n        Actually, the example input in the problem statement is given as:\n            Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', ...]\n\n        And the example output: \n            'YES\\nabrakadabra'\n\n        So the original s is \"abrakadabra\", and the merged string is 21 characters.\n\n        How do we get 21 from two copies of \"abrakadabra\" (each 11) with an overlap of 1?\n            Without error: 11*2 = 22.\n            With error and overlap 1: we remove the overlapping part (1 character) so total length = 11 + 10 = 21.\n\n        Similarly, for overlap 4: \n            Total length = 11 + (11-4) = 18.\n\n        But the example output says that one possibility is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (21) and the other is \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (which I counted as 18? Let me count again: \n            \"abrakadabrakadabra\": \n                a b r a k a d a b r a k a d a b r a -> 17 characters? \n\n        Actually, let me write it: \n            abrakadabrakadabra: \n                a b r a k a d a b r a k a d a b r a -> \n                positions: \n                0:a,1:b,2:r,3:a,4:k,5:a,6:d,7:a,8:b,9:r,10:a,11:k,12:a,13:d,14:a,15:b,16:r,17:a -> 18 characters.\n\n        So the example input string \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" is 21, and \"abrakadabrakadabra\" is 18.\n\n        The problem says: \n            \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (21) OR \"abrakadabrakadabra\" (18)\n\n        So the rule: \n            Given s, the merged string t will have length = len(s) + len(s) - overlap = 2*n - L, where L is the overlap (and L>=1 and L<n).\n\n        Therefore, we have: \n            t = s[0: n - L] + s[L: n] + s[L: n]   ? No.\n\n        Actually, the process is: \n            The first copy of s is written entirely, and then the second copy is written without the first L characters (because those L characters are already provided by the end of the first copy). \n\n        So t = s + s[L:]\n\n        Then the length is n + (n - L) = 2*n - L.\n\n        Now, we are given t and we must check if there exists an s and an integer L (1<=L<n) such that:\n            t = s + s[L:]\n\n        Also note: the two original messages were identical, so s must be the same as the base string.\n\n        How to approach the problem?\n\n        Conditions:\n          Let n = len(t). Then we must have that t is composed of two parts: \n            Let x = s (the base string) and we don't know n_x (the length of x). Then the entire string t must be split into two consecutive copies of x, but with an overlap of L (so the second copy is shifted by L).\n\n        However, note: the two messages are identical, so the base string x is fixed and must be the same for both.\n\n        Alternate view: \n          Since the two messages are the same, the entire string t must be such that if we take a substring x of length n1, then the next part must be the tail of x (or something) but actually the condition is:\n\n          We require that the entire string t can be broken down as:\n            t = A + B, where A is a prefix of x and B is a suffix of x, but wait.\n\n        Actually, we know that the two messages are copies of x. The merging happens at the boundary. The first message is x, the second is x. The merging uses the last L characters of the first and the first L of the second. Then the resulting string is x + x[L:].\n\n        Therefore, the entire string t must be equal to x + x[L:].\n\n        Also, the length of t is 2*n_x - L.\n\n        Now, what are the constraints on x? \n          x must be a substring of t of length n_x, and then the next part (from n_x to the end) must be x[L:]. \n\n        But note: the entire string t is built from two copies of x, so we can also think:\n\n          Let n_x be the length of x. Then the length of t must be 2 * n_x - L, and L is between 1 and n_x-1.\n\n        How can we find x? \n\n        Observation:\n          The entire string t must be periodic with period n_x, but with an offset. Actually, the string t must satisfy:\n\n          For all i from 0 to n_x - L - 1, the character at position i+n_x (if it exists) must equal the character at position i+L? \n\n        Alternatively, we can try to consider the possible lengths of x. \n\n        Note: the entire string t must be broken into two parts: the first part is x (length n_x) and the second part is x[L:] (length n_x - L). Therefore, the total length is n_x + (n_x - L) = 2*n_x - L.\n\n        Also, since L is between 1 and n_x-1, the length of t must be between n_x+1 and 2*n_x-1.\n\n        But note: we are given t. We don't know x. \n\n        Another observation: the entire string t must be equal to x repeated twice with an overlap. \n\n        There is an alternative way: \n          We can consider the entire string t and try to find a split such that the first part (say of length k) and the second part (of length m) must satisfy: \n          k + m = len(t) and k = n_x, m = n_x - L, so k = n_x and m = k - L, hence k = n_x and m = n_x - L, so k > m (since L>=1) and k + m = 2*k - L = len(t).\n\n        But note: the two parts are related: the second part must be the tail of x (which is the same as the tail of the first part). \n\n        Actually, we can think: \n          Let n_x be the length of x. Then we have two conditions:\n            Condition 1: The first n_x characters of t must be x.\n            Condition 2: The substring starting at position n_x of length n_x - L must equal the substring of x from L to the end.\n\n        But note: the entire string t is x + x[L:], so the second part is exactly the substring of x from L to the end.\n\n        Therefore, we can iterate over the possible lengths of x. \n\n        How long can x be? \n          The entire string t is built from two copies of x, so the length of t must be at least n_x+1 (minimum overlap 1) and at most 2*n_x-1 (maximum overlap n_x-1). \n\n        Also, note: the two copies of x are consecutive. Therefore, the entire string t must be such that the first n_x characters is x, and then the next (len(t)-n_x) characters must be the tail of x (from index L to the end).\n\n        But note: the tail of x is of length n_x - L, and we know that the total length is n_x + (n_x - L) = 2*n_x - L.\n\n        Therefore, the length of t must be even? Not necessarily: \n          Example: t = \"abcd\" -> no error (so NO). But what if we have t = \"abcabc\" (which is 6) and that is considered NO.\n\n        Actually, we are told that if the entire second message is overlapped (so L = n_x) then that is not considered an error. But note: the problem says \"Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения\", meaning L < n_x. So the maximum overlap is n_x-1.\n\n        Therefore, the minimum length of t is n_x+1, and the maximum is 2*n_x-1.\n\n        Now, the entire string t must be at least n_x+1 and at most 2*n_x-1. \n\n        Also, note that the two copies of x are consecutive, so the entire string t must be of length at least n_x+1 (so the minimal length of t is n_x+1). \n\n        Now, we can express n_x in terms of the length of t, say n_t = len(t). Then we must have:\n          n_x <= n_t - 1   (since at least one character is not overlapped, so the second part is non-empty) and \n          n_t = 2*n_x - L >= 2*n_x - (n_x-1) = n_x+1, so n_x <= n_t - 1.\n\n        Also, from the equation: n_t = 2*n_x - L, we have n_x = (n_t + L) / 2, and since L is at least 1 and at most n_x-1, we have:\n          n_x = (n_t + L) / 2 => n_t must be odd? Not necessarily: \n          Example: n_x=5, L=1 -> n_t=9; n_x=5, L=3 -> n_t=7.\n\n        Actually, we can iterate over possible n_x (the length of x) such that:\n          n_x >= ceil((n_t+1)/2) ? \n\n        Alternatively, note: \n          n_t = 2*n_x - L, so n_x = (n_t + L) / 2, and L is between 1 and n_x-1. Then:\n          n_t = 2*n_x - L => n_x = (n_t + L) / 2, and since L <= n_x-1, we have:\n          n_x >= (n_t + 1) / 2, but also n_x must be an integer and n_t must be such that (n_t + L) is even.\n\n        However, there is a simpler way: \n\n        We know that the entire string t must be broken into two parts: \n          Let x be the base string. Then the first part is x (length n_x) and the second part is x[L:] (length n_x - L). \n\n        Also, note: the second part is a substring of x. Therefore, the entire string t must satisfy:\n\n          t[0: n_x] = x\n          t[n_x: n_x + (n_x - L)] = x[L: ]\n\n        But also, note that the second part of t must be a substring of the first part (because x[L:] is contained in x). \n\n        Moreover, the second part of t must be exactly the substring of x from L to the end.\n\n        How to find x? \n\n        Idea: \n          Let n_x be the length of x. Then the entire string t must be of length 2*n_x - L, so n_x must be greater than n_t/2 (because L>=1, so n_x > n_t/2). \n\n        Actually, from n_t = 2*n_x - L, and L>=1, we have n_x >= ceil((n_t+1)/2). \n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Let n = len(t)\n          2. We iterate over possible n_x (the length of x) such that n_x is in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n] (because the minimal n_x is (n+1)//2 (ceiling) and maximal is n).\n\n          But note: if n_x is too large, then the second part (n_x - L) might be negative? Actually, n_x must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) because:\n            n_t = 2*n_x - L >= 2*n_x - (n_x-1) = n_x+1, so n_x <= n_t-1. And also, n_x must be at least ceil((n+1)/2) because the minimal total length is n_x+1, so n_x+1 <= n_t -> n_x <= n_t-1, and the minimal n_x is (n_t+1)//2? Actually, from n_t = 2*n_x - L and L>=1, we have n_t <= 2*n_x-1, so n_x >= ceil((n_t+1)/2). \n\n          Example: n_t=5 -> n_x>= (5+1)//2 = 3. Then n_x can be 3 or 4 or 5? But wait, if n_x=3, then n_t=5 => 5 = 2*3 - L => L=1, which is valid. \n          If n_x=4, then n_t=5 => 5=2*4 - L => L=3, which is valid (since L must be < n_x -> 3<4).\n          If n_x=5, then n_t=5 => 5=2*5 - L => L=5, but L must be less than n_x (5<5 is false) -> invalid.\n\n          So n_x must be in the range [ceil((n_t+1)/2), n_t-1] (if n_t>=2).\n\n          However, note: the minimal n_x is ceil((n_t+1)/2) and the maximal n_x is floor(n_t) (but we have n_x<=n_t-1).\n\n        Then for a candidate n_x, we set:\n          L = 2*n_x - n_t   (because n_t = 2*n_x - L => L = 2*n_x - n_t)\n\n        Conditions for candidate n_x:\n          - L must be an integer and in the range [1, n_x-1].\n\n        Then, we must check that:\n          The first n_x characters of t form x.\n          The substring t[n_x: n_x + (n_x - L)] (which is t[n_x:]) must equal x[L:].\n\n        But note: the length of the second part is n_x - L, and we know the entire string t has length n_t, so we must have:\n          n_x + (n_x - L) = n_t, which is satisfied by our equation.\n\n        However, we must also ensure that the second part of t (from index n_x to the end) is exactly the substring of x from index L to the end.\n\n        But note: the entire string t is built from x and then the tail of x (of length n_x-L). \n\n        Steps for candidate n_x:\n          1. Check that L = 2*n_x - n_t is an integer and 1<= L <= n_x-1.\n          2. Then, let x = t[0:n_x]\n          3. Check that the substring t[n_x:] equals x[L:].\n\n        However, note: the second part of t is exactly the tail of x (from index L to the end). \n\n        Example: \n          t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\", n_t=21.\n          Candidate n_x: from ceil((21+1)/2)=11 to 20.\n\n          We found that n_x=11 gives L=2*11-21=1, which is in [1,10].\n          Then x = t[0:11] = \"abrakadabra\"\n          Then the second part of t is t[11:] = \"abrabrakadabra\" (length 10) and x[L:] = x[1:] = \"brakadabra\" (length 10). \n          But \"abrabrakadabra\" != \"brakadabra\", so this candidate fails.\n\n          However, wait: the example says the answer is \"YES\" and s is \"abrakadabra\". \n\n          Why? Because the example output says: \n              Input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' -> Output: 'YES\\nabrakadabra'\n\n          But according to our condition, for n_x=11, the second part of t is \"abrabrakadabra\", and x[1:] is \"brakadabra\", which are not equal.\n\n          What's wrong?\n\n          Let me recompute the example:\n\n          The example says: \n            Without error: two copies of \"abrakadabra\" would be \"abrakadabraabrakadabra\" (length 22).\n            With error and overlap 1: \n                The first message: \"abrakadabra\"\n                The second message: \"abrakadabra\", but we merge the last 1 character of the first (which is 'a') with the first 1 of the second (which is 'a'). \n                Then the merged string is: \"abrakadabra\" + \"brakadabra\" (because the second message without the first character) -> \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\n          So the second part should be \"brakadabra\", not \"abrabrakadabra\".\n\n          In our candidate, we took the second part from index 11 to the end (which is 21-11=10 characters) and compared it to x[1:] (which is 10 characters). \n\n          But the merged string is built by taking the entire first message (11 characters) and then the second message without the first L=1 character, so the second part is indeed the substring from index L (which is 1) to the end of x? \n\n          Actually, the second part is the substring of the second message (which is x) without the first L characters, i.e., x[L:].\n\n          In the example, the second part is x[1:], which is \"brakadabra\", but the actual t[11:] is \"brakadabra\"? \n\n          Let me break t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\":\n            First 11: \"abrakadabra\"\n            Next 10: \"brakadabra\"\n\n          But wait, the string t[11:11+10] is \"brakadabra\", which is indeed x[1:].\n\n          However, in our code above, we did:\n            t[11:] = t[11:21] = \"brakadabra\"\n\n          But wait, in Python, slicing: \n            t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n            t[11:11+10] is correct, but note: the length of t is 21, so t[11:21] is 10 characters.\n\n          But why did I write above that t[11:] is \"abrabrakadabra\"? \n\n          Let me count the indices:\n\n          t = \"a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\"\n          Index 0 to 20.\n\n          First 11: from 0 to 10: \"abrakadabra\"\n          Then from 11 to 20: \n            index11: 'b', index12:'r', index13:'a', index14:'k', index15:'a', index16:'d', index17:'a', index18:'b', index19:'r', index20:'a'\n\n          So the substring from 11 to 20 is \"brakadabra\", which is indeed x[1:].\n\n          So why did I say \"abrabrakadabra\" earlier? I must have miscounted.\n\n          Correction: \n            t = \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n            Break it down:\n              \"abrakadabra\" (first 11) \n              then the next 10: \"brakadabra\"\n\n          So the candidate n_x=11 works.\n\n        Therefore, algorithm:\n\n          Let n = len(t)\n          For n_x in range(ceil((n+1)/2), n):   # from floor((n+1)/2) to n-1, but note: ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1)//2 if n is odd, but we can use (n+1)//2 for ceiling division for integers.\n\n          Actually, we can set:\n            min_nx = (n+1)//2   # This is the ceiling of (n+1)/2? \n            For example: n=21 -> (21+1)//2 = 22//2=11 -> correct.\n            n=5 -> (5+1)//2=3 -> correct.\n\n          Then for each n_x from min_nx to n-1 (inclusive):\n\n            L = 2*n_x - n\n\n            If L is not an integer? Actually, it is an integer because n_x and n are integers.\n\n            Conditions: \n              1. L must be between 1 and n_x-1 (both inclusive).\n              2. Then, we set x = t[0:n_x]\n              3. The second part of t is t[n_x: n_x + (n_x - L)] but note: the total length is n, and n_x + (n_x - L) = 2*n_x - L = n, so the second part is t[n_x:]\n\n            Then, we check if t[n_x:] == x[L:]\n\n          If we find one candidate n_x that satisfies, then we output \"YES\" and x.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that the two messages are identical and the base string is s. We are to output any possible s.\n\n        But wait: what if there are multiple candidates? Then we can output any.\n\n        Example: \n          Input: \"acacacaca\" (from the example) -> Output: \"YES\\nacaca\"\n\n          Let's check: \n            t = \"acacacaca\", n=9.\n\n            min_nx = (9+1)//2 = 5.\n\n            n_x from 5 to 8.\n\n            n_x=5: \n                L = 2*5 - 9 = 1 -> valid (1<=1<=4)\n                x = t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n                second part = t[5:] = \"caca\" (length 4) and x[1:] = \"caca\" -> matches.\n\n            So we output \"YES\\nacaca\"\n\n        Another example: \n          Input: \"abcabc\", n=6 -> Output: \"NO\"\n\n          min_nx = (6+1)//2 = 3 (since 7//2=3)\n\n          n_x from 3 to 5.\n\n          n_x=3: L=2*3-6=0 -> not in [1,2] -> skip.\n          n_x=4: L=2*4-6=2 -> valid (1<=2<=3)\n                x = t[0:4] = \"abcabc\"[:4] = \"abca\"\n                second part = t[4:] = \"bc\" (length 2) and x[2:] = \"ca\" -> \"bc\" != \"ca\" -> fail.\n          n_x=5: L=2*5-6=4 -> valid (1<=4<=4)\n                x = t[0:5] = \"abcab\"\n                second part = t[5:] = \"c\" (length 1) and x[4:] = \"b\" -> \"c\" != \"b\" -> fail.\n\n          So no candidate -> output \"NO\"\n\n        But wait, the example \"abcabc\" is not an error, so we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example input \"abcabc\" is 6 characters. The problem says that if we have two copies of \"abc\", then that is not an error. But our algorithm did not consider n_x=3 because L=0 which is not allowed (we require L>=1). \n\n        But note: the problem says that the entire second message being overlapped (i.e., L = n_x) is not considered an error, but also note that our candidate requires L < n_x. \n\n        However, what if we consider the possibility that the entire second message is overlapped (L=n_x)? Then the merged string would be:\n            t = s + s[L:] = s + s[n_x:] = s + \"\" = s, so the total length would be n_x.\n\n        But our equation: n_t = 2*n_x - L, then if L=n_x, n_t = n_x, so the length of t would be n_x. \n\n        In the example \"abcabc\", the length is 6, so if we consider n_x=3, then we require L=3, and then the merged string would be of length 3, which is not 6.\n\n        So the condition for the entire second message being overlapped is not applicable here because the length of t is 6, not 3.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n          n = len(t)\n          min_nx = (n+1)//2   # This is the smallest n_x (ceiling of (n+1)/2)\n\n          For n_x in range(min_nx, n):\n            L = 2*n_x - n\n            if L < 1 or L >=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlapping part of positive length but less than the length of `s`. If such an `s` exists, we output \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be constructed by taking two copies of `s` and merging them such that the end of the first copy overlaps with the start of the second copy. The overlap length `L` must be between 1 and `len(s) - 1`.\n2. **Insight**: For a candidate string `s` of length `n_x`, the total length of `t` must satisfy `n_t = 2 * n_x - L`, where `L` is the overlap length. This implies that `n_x` must be at least `(n_t + 1) // 2` and at most `n_t - 1`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over possible lengths `n_x` from `(n_t + 1) // 2` to `n_t - 1`. For each `n_x`, compute the overlap length `L = 2 * n_x - n_t`. If `L` is within the valid range (1 ≤ L < n_x), check if the substring of `t` starting at position `n_x` matches the suffix of `s` (i.e., `t[n_x:] == s[L:]`). If such an `s` is found, it is a solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    min_nx = (n + 1) // 2\n    ans = \"NO\"\n    for n_x in range(min_nx, n):\n        L = 2 * n_x - n\n        if L < 1 or L >= n_x:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:n_x]\n        if t.startswith(s_candidate) and t.startswith(s_candidate + s_candidate[:n_x - L]):\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            return\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initial Setup**: Calculate the minimum possible length `min_nx` of the base string `s` as `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is the length of `t`.\n3. **Iteration Over Possible Lengths**: For each candidate length `n_x` from `min_nx` to `n-1`:\n   - Compute the overlap length `L = 2 * n_x - n`.\n   - Check if `L` is valid (1 ≤ L < `n_x`).\n   - If valid, extract the candidate string `s_candidate` from the start of `t` of length `n_x`.\n   - Verify if the remaining part of `t` (after `s_candidate`) matches the suffix of `s_candidate` starting at index `L`.\n4. **Output Result**: If a valid `s_candidate` is found, print \"YES\" followed by `s_candidate`. If no valid candidate is found after all iterations, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible candidates for `s` by leveraging the constraints on the overlap length and the structure of the resulting string `t`. The solution ensures correctness by validating each candidate against the problem's requirements.",
