Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n (number of vertices) and a (the target angle in degrees)\n We are to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 (from 1 to n) such that the angle at v2 (formed by the points v1, v2, v3) is as close as possible to a.\n\n In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n The angle we are interested in is an angle formed by three vertices. However, note that the problem does not require the center of the polygon, but just three vertices.\n\n Observation:\n The angle at vertex v2 can be calculated using the circle. Since the polygon is regular and convex, we can use the following idea:\n\n Let's fix the vertex v2. Then, we consider two other vertices v1 and v3. The angle at v2 is determined by the two edges (v2 to v1) and (v2 to v3). \n\n However, note that the angle we are forming might be measured inside or outside? But the problem states: \"the value |angle - a| should be minimized\", and the example uses angles that are part of the polygon's internal structure.\n\n Important: In a convex polygon, the angle we form must be less than 180 degrees (because it's an angle in a convex polygon). The angle we calculate is the one inside the polygon? Actually, note that the problem says: \"three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3\" and then the angle with vertex v2. In the context of the polygon, we can consider two rays from v2: one going through v1 and the other through v3.\n\n But note: the angle we are calculating is the one between these two rays. However, the problem does not specify whether we take the smaller angle or the larger one. But since the polygon is convex, the angle we form must be the one that lies entirely within the polygon? Actually, no: we are just taking three points. The angle we compute is the one at v2, and because the polygon is convex, the angle we form will be the one that is either the interior angle of the triangle or the exterior? \n\n Let me clarify with examples:\n\n Example 1: n=3, a=15. The answer is any three vertices (which are the only three). The triangle has an angle of 60 degrees. But wait, the problem says: the angle formed by the three distinct vertices. In fact, the problem does not require the angle to be the one of the polygon's own angles, but the angle between the two sides (v1-v2 and v2-v3). \n\n However, note: the example input \"4 67\" gives output \"2 1 3\", which forms a 45-degree angle (since in a square, if you take two adjacent sides from a vertex, the angle is 90, but if you take two non-adjacent sides? Actually, let me check the example outputs:\n\n Input: \"4 67\" -> Output: \"2 1 3\"\n\n In the square (n=4), the vertices are labeled 1,2,3,4 in clockwise order.\n\n Let's draw vertex 2 (the middle one in the output \"2 1 3\"): \n   From vertex 2, we have edges to 1 and to 3 (if we consider adjacent). But wait, the example output is \"2 1 3\". So the angle is formed by the points 1, 2, 3. In the square, the vertices 1,2,3: \n     Vertex 1 is connected to 2, and vertex 3 is connected to 2. The two edges are from 2 to 1 and 2 to 3. In the square, the angle between edge 2-1 and 2-3 is 90 degrees? But wait, the example says that 45 degrees was chosen for the second sample? Actually, wait:\n\n The sample input is \"4 67\", and the output is \"2 1 3\". The note says: \"Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only.\" and then the second sample test (input \"4 67\") chooses 45 degrees because |45-67| < |90-67|.\n\n How do we get 45 degrees?\n\n Consider: In a square, the four vertices are equally spaced on a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 90 degrees. The angle at a vertex (like vertex 2) when we take two edges that are not adjacent? \n\n Actually, the angle we are measuring is the one at vertex 2. But note: the problem says that the two sides of the angle are the ones from v2 to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the vertex (v2) by the other two vertices (v1 and v3) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The solution involves leveraging the properties of regular polygons and efficiently checking possible angles without resorting to brute-force methods.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Angle Calculation**: In a regular convex n-gon, the angle formed at any vertex by two other vertices can be derived from the central angles. The key insight is that the angle between two chords from a vertex is determined by the number of steps (arcs) between the vertices on the polygon.\n2. **Central Angle Calculation**: The central angle between two adjacent vertices is \\( \\frac{360}{n} \\) degrees. The angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices separated by k arcs is calculated using the formula \\( 180 - k \\times \\frac{360}{n} \\). This formula accounts for the internal angle of the triangle formed by the three vertices.\n3. **Efficient Search for Optimal Angle**: Instead of checking all possible triplets (which would be computationally expensive), we consider the closest angles around the target angle 'a' by leveraging the symmetry of the regular polygon. We calculate potential angles based on the number of arcs between vertices and check the minimal absolute difference from 'a'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_angle = 360\n    central_angle = total_angle / n\n    \n    candidate_angles = set()\n    for k in range(1, n//2 + 1):\n        angle_val = 180 - k * central_angle\n        candidate_angles.add((abs(angle_val - a), angle_val))\n        \n    min_diff = min(candidate_angles, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]\n    best_angle = None\n    for diff, angle_val in candidate_angles:\n        if diff == min_diff:\n            best_angle = angle_val\n            break\n            \n    k = (180 - best_angle) / central_angle\n    step = int(round(k))\n    if step < 1 or step >= n//2 + 1:\n        step = 1\n        \n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = (v2 - step - 1) % n + 1\n    v3 = (v2 + step + 1) % n + 1\n    \n    if v1 == v3:\n        v1 = (v1 - 1) % n + 1\n        v3 = (v3 + 1) % n + 1\n        \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, n (number of vertices) and a (target angle).\n2. **Central Angle Calculation**: The central angle between two adjacent vertices is computed as \\( \\frac{360}{n} \\).\n3. **Generating Candidate Angles**: For each possible step count k (from 1 to n/2), the angle formed by vertices separated by k arcs is calculated. The absolute difference between each candidate angle and the target angle 'a' is stored.\n4. **Finding the Best Angle**: The candidate angle with the smallest absolute difference to 'a' is selected.\n5. **Determining Vertices**: Using the best angle, the corresponding vertices are determined by stepping a calculated number of arcs from a fixed vertex (vertex 1). The vertices are adjusted to ensure they are distinct and within the valid range.\n6. **Output**: The three vertices forming the angle closest to 'a' are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space by leveraging the geometric properties of regular polygons, ensuring optimal performance even for large n.",
