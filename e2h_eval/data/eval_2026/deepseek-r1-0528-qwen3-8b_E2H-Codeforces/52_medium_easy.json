Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with two integers: a and b.\n We start with `a` new candles. Each candle burns for 1 hour and then becomes a leftover (which can be combined to make new candles).\n We can combine `b` leftovers to make one new candle.\n\n The process:\n   - Initially, we have `a` new candles and 0 leftovers.\n   - Each hour, we can use one new candle (or a candle made from leftovers) to light up the room for that hour.\n   - After burning, each candle becomes one leftover.\n\n However, we can reuse leftovers: every time we have at least `b` leftovers, we can convert them into floor(leftovers / b) new candles, and the remainder leftovers remain.\n\n Steps:\n   Let `hours = 0`\n   Let `leftover = 0`\n   We start with `candles = a`\n\n   But note: we can simulate until we don't have enough to burn for an hour.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   while candles + leftover >= 1:\n        We burn as many candles as possible? Actually, we burn one candle per hour, but we can burn multiple in one go only if we have multiple.\n\n   However, the problem says: when we light a new candle, it burns for an hour. So we can think:\n\n   We have two types: current new candles and leftovers that we can convert.\n\n   Actually, we can model the process by:\n\n   total_hours = 0\n   current_candles = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   But note: we can also consider that each candle gives one hour and one leftover.\n\n   We can do:\n\n   while current_candles > 0:\n        total_hours += current_candles   # because we can burn all current_candles in separate hours\n        leftover += current_candles\n        # Now, we can convert leftover into new candles: every b leftovers make one candle\n        new_candles = leftover // b\n        leftover = leftover % b\n\n        current_candles = new_candles\n\n   However, wait: this might overcount because the conversion happens after burning, and the burning of the converted candles will then produce more leftovers.\n\n   But note: the above simulation is standard for these kinds of problems.\n\n   However, let's test with the example: \"4 2\"\n\n   Step 0: current_candles = 4, leftover = 0, total_hours = 0.\n   Step 1: \n        total_hours += 4 -> 4\n        leftover = 4\n        new_candles = 4 // 2 = 2, leftover = 0\n        current_candles becomes 2.\n\n   Step 2:\n        total_hours += 2 -> 6\n        leftover = 2\n        new_candles = 2 // 2 = 1, leftover = 0\n        current_candles becomes 1.\n\n   Step 3:\n        total_hours += 1 -> 7\n        leftover = 1\n        new_candles = 1 // 2 = 0, leftover = 1 -> then current_candles becomes 0, so we break.\n\n   This gives 7, which matches.\n\n   But wait, the example input is \"4 2\" and output is 7.\n\n   Another example: \"6 3\"\n\n   Step 0: current_candles = 6, leftover=0, total_hours=0.\n   Step 1: \n        total_hours=6, leftover=6\n        new_candles = 6//3=2, leftover=0\n        current_candles=2\n\n   Step 2:\n        total_hours=8, leftover=2\n        new_candles=0, leftover=2 -> done.\n\n   Output 8, which matches.\n\n   However, note that the above simulation does not account for the fact that we might not need to burn all the current candles at once if we are going to convert leftovers. But the problem says: we act optimally. And we can burn one candle per hour, and we can use any candle (whether new or recycled) for an hour.\n\n   The above method counts every hour that we burn a candle, and then we recycle the leftovers. It's correct.\n\n   But note: the initial step uses the initial a candles. Then we get a // b new candles, etc.\n\n   However, there is an alternative way: \n\n   total = a\n   while a >= b:\n        hours += a\n        a = a // b + a % b   # But wait, no: we use all a to get some new ones, and then we continue with the new ones and the leftovers.\n\n   Actually, the above simulation is equivalent to:\n\n   hours = 0\n   candles = a\n   leftover = 0\n\n   while True:\n        # Burn all current candles (if any)\n        if candles == 0 and leftover < b:\n            break\n        # But we can also think: we can burn one candle at a time, but the above method burns all at once.\n\n   However, our first simulation is simpler.\n\n   But wait: what if we have leftovers from previous steps? The above code does:\n\n        total_hours += current_candles   (burning all current candles)\n        then add the leftovers from those burned candles (which is current_candles) and then convert.\n\n   This is correct because burning a candle gives one leftover, so burning k candles gives k leftovers.\n\n   However, note that the conversion happens after burning, and then we use the new candles (from conversion) as part of the next cycle.\n\n   But the problem allows us to use any candle (new or recycled) arbitrarily. So we can burn all the current candles we have (which includes the ones we just created from leftovers in the previous step) at the same time.\n\n   Therefore, the simulation is correct.\n\n   However, note that the problem does not require to burn one candle at a time necessarily. We can burn as many as we have (each burning lasts one hour). So we can burn all available candles (which are the current_candles) at the same time, and then get leftovers from all of them.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"Vasily lights up a new candle\", meaning one candle per lighting. But he can light multiple candles in multiple hours. The key is: we have a total number of candles (current and recycled) that we can use, and we can use them one by one.\n\n   The above simulation uses all available candles (current) in one go and then converts the leftovers. This is valid because burning one candle per hour, so burning 'current' candles takes 'current' hours.\n\n   However, we must note that we cannot burn more than we have. The simulation is correct.\n\n   But let's consider the possibility of having leftover candles from previous cycles. Our simulation accounts for that by accumulating leftover and converting them.\n\n   One more edge: if b is 2, and a is 1, then:\n\n        Step0: candles=1, leftover=0, hours=0.\n        Then: hours += 1 -> 1, leftover becomes 1, then new_candles = 1//2 = 0, leftover=1 -> then break.\n\n        So total hours=1.\n\n   This is correct: one candle burns for one hour.\n\n   However, note: the problem states that Vasily can make b went out candles into a new candle. So if we have less than b leftovers, we cannot make a new candle.\n\n   The simulation breaks when after burning we don't have enough leftovers to make a new candle and no new candles left.\n\n   But wait: what if we have leftover from previous steps and we also have new candles? The simulation continues as long as current_candles (the ones we get from conversion) are positive OR we have leftover that can be converted? Actually, the condition is: we break when current_candles becomes zero AND leftover is less than b? \n\n   In our simulation, we don't check the leftover condition separately. We break when current_candles becomes zero and then in the next iteration, if leftover is less than b, we break. However, our code doesn't break explicitly. Let me look:\n\n   We set current_candles to 0 and then the next time we enter the loop, we check if current_candles>0? Actually, no: the loop condition is while current_candles>0? \n\n   But wait, in our simulation we did:\n\n        while current_candles > 0:\n\n   Then we burn all current_candles, then set current_candles to the new_candles (which is floor(leftover/b)).\n\n   However, note: we don't consider leftover alone. The leftover is stored and used in the next iteration to form new_candles along with the current_candles.\n\n   But actually, the leftover is carried over and we don't burn them until they are converted. The process is:\n\n        We have two types: current_candles (which we can burn immediately) and leftover (which we can only burn after converting, or rather, we don't burn leftover directly).\n\n   However, the problem doesn't say we can burn leftover. We must convert them to get new candles.\n\n   So the simulation is:\n\n        We burn all current_candles (so we get current_candles hours and current_candles leftovers).\n        Then, we combine the leftover (from the burned candles and any leftover from before) to make new_candles.\n\n   But note: the leftover from previous steps is carried over and added to the current burned leftovers.\n\n   Actually, in our simulation we did:\n\n        leftover += current_candles   [at the beginning of the loop?]\n\n   However, wait: in the example we started with 0 leftover, then after burning 4, we have 4 leftover, then we convert 4 into 2, so then we set current_candles to 2 and leftover to 0.\n\n   But what if we had leftover from before?\n\n   Example: a=5, b=3\n\n        Start: current_candles=5, leftover=0, total=0.\n        Step1: total=5, leftover=5.\n                new_candles = 5//3 = 1, leftover=2.\n                current_candles=1.\n\n        Step2: total=6, leftover=1+? Wait, no: we are adding the 1 (from current_candles) to the leftover? Actually, we did:\n\n            leftover += current_candles   -> but wait, in the example above we didn't have leftover from previous steps? \n\n        Let me rewrite the code:\n\n            candles = a\n            leftover = 0\n            hours = 0\n\n            while candles > 0:\n                hours += candles   # burn all the current candles\n                leftover += candles   # because each burned candle gives one leftover\n                # Now, we can convert the leftover into new candles\n                new_candles = leftover // b\n                leftover = leftover % b\n                candles = new_candles\n\n        Now, for a=5, b=3:\n\n            Iteration1: \n                candles=5 -> hours=5, leftover=5\n                new_candles = 5//3 = 1, leftover=2\n                candles=1\n\n            Iteration2:\n                candles=1 -> hours=6, leftover=1+? Wait, no: we are adding the current candles (which is 1) to the leftover? \n\n            Actually, in the code above, we are doing:\n\n                leftover += candles   (which is 1)\n\n            Then leftover becomes 2 (from previous) + 1 = 3.\n\n            Then new_candles = 3//3=1, leftover=0, candles=1.\n\n            Iteration3:\n                hours=7, leftover=1 (from the 1 candle we burned) -> then convert: 1//3=0, leftover=1, candles=0 -> break.\n\n            So total hours=7.\n\n        Let's verify manually:\n\n            Start with 5 candles: burn for 5 hours -> now we have 5 burned (leftover) and 5 new candles become leftovers.\n            Then we can make 5//3 = 1 new candle (with 2 leftover).\n            Then we have 1 new candle to burn -> hour 6.\n            Then that candle leaves 1 leftover (so total leftover becomes 2 (from before) + 1 = 3? Actually, we have 2 leftover from the first conversion and then we burn the new candle and get 1 more, so total 3.\n\n            Then we convert 3 to 1 new candle -> hour 7, and then burn that candle -> hour 8? \n\n            Wait, I see a discrepancy.\n\n        Correction: In the second iteration, after burning the 1 candle, we get 1 leftover. Then we combine that 1 with the leftover from the first conversion (which was 2) -> so total 3. Then we get 1 new candle and 0 leftover. Then in the third iteration, we burn that 1 candle (hour 7) and get 1 leftover, then try to convert: 1//3=0, so we break. So total hours=7.\n\n        But according to the manual calculation, we should have:\n\n            Hours 1-5: burn 5 candles -> 5 hours, leftovers=5.\n            Then we make 1 candle (using 3 of the 5), so we have 2 leftover and 1 new candle.\n            Then burn the 1 new candle (hour 6) -> now we have 2 (old leftover) + 1 (from this candle) = 3 leftover.\n            Then we make 1 candle from 3 (using all 3), so we have 0 leftover and 1 new candle.\n            Then burn the 1 new candle (hour 7) -> now we have 1 leftover (from this candle) and no new candles because 1<3.\n\n            So total hours=7.\n\n        So the simulation is correct.\n\n        However, note that the above code does:\n\n            In the second iteration, we have:\n                candles=1 (from conversion)\n                Then we add this 1 to leftover (which was 2) -> so leftover becomes 3.\n\n            Then we compute new_candles = 3//3=1, and leftover=0.\n\n            Then in the third iteration, we use the 1 from the conversion (but wait, we set candles=1 again) and then burn it.\n\n        But wait, we set candles=1 again, so we burn that one and then leftover becomes 1 (from that one) and then we break.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: the process is that we have two sources of candles: the initial a, and then the ones we convert. And the leftovers are the sum of the burned candles (from the current and previous cycles) that haven't been converted.\n\n        The above code is correct.\n\n        But note: the above code does not account for the fact that we might have leftover from previous steps that are not burned until converted. That's okay because we accumulate the leftover and then convert as much as we can.\n\n        However, the above code has a small issue: we are updating `leftover` by adding the entire `candles` (which we are burning) and then converting the entire leftover. But note: we are allowed to use the leftover from previous steps without burning them? Actually, no: we must burn a candle to get a leftover. But the problem is: we cannot burn leftover; we must convert them to get new candles. So the leftover from previous steps are just stored until we have enough to convert.\n\n        The simulation is correct because:\n\n            We burn all the current candles (which are the ones we have from conversion) and that adds to the leftover pool.\n\n        However, there is a more efficient way to write the same logic without using a while loop that accumulates all the candles at once. But the constraints are small (a and b between 1 and 1000) so the while loop will run at most around log_b(a) times, which is acceptable.\n\n        But let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the above simulation does not account for the fact that we might have leftover from previous steps that were not burned. Actually, we do: we carry the leftover from one iteration to the next.\n\n        Code:\n\n        Read input: \n            data = input().split()\n            a = int(data[0])\n            b = int(data[1])\n\n        Then:\n\n        candles = a\n        leftover = 0\n        hours = 0\n\n        while candles > 0:\n            hours += candles\n            leftover += candles\n            # Convert the leftover into new candles\n            new_candles = leftover // b\n            leftover = leftover % b\n            candles = new_candles\n\n        print(hours)\n\n        Let's test with the examples:\n\n        Example1: a=4, b=2 -> hours=7 (correct)\n\n        Example2: a=6, b=3 -> hours=8 (correct)\n\n        Example3: a=1, b=2 -> hours=1 (correct)\n\n        Example4: a=5, b=3 -> hours=7 (correct)\n\n        However, wait: what if we have leftover from previous steps and we don't burn all the current candles? Actually, we are burning all the current candles (the variable `candles`) in the current iteration. Is that always optimal?\n\n        Yes, because burning one candle per hour, and we can burn as many as we have (without restriction) in consecutive hours.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n        Read the input, then:\n\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n        candles = a\n        leftover = 0\n        hours = 0\n\n        while candles > 0:\n            hours += candles\n            leftover += candles\n            # Calculate how many new candles we can make\n            new_candles = leftover // b\n            leftover = leftover % b\n            candles = new_candles\n\n        print(hours)\n\n        But wait, there is a potential issue: the leftover from previous iterations is being added to the current candles we are burning. This is correct because the leftover is stored and then when we burn the current candles (which are the ones we got from conversion) we are effectively using the entire stock.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require burning the candles we just got from conversion separately. They are just like any other candle.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is as above.\n\n        Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example: ['4 2', '6 3'] -> outputs 7 and 8.\n\n        But wait, the sample input is given as a list of strings: ['4 2', '6 3']. However, the problem says the input is a single line. So we read one line.\n\n        We assume one line of input.\n\n        Code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            # but the problem says there are two integers, so we assume there is data.\n            pass\n        else:\n            a = int(data[0])\n            b = int(data[1])\n\n        Then the rest.\n\n        We'll write accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the input is two integers in one line.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        Read one line, split into two integers, then run the while loop.\n\n        But note: the above code might be inefficient if we have very large numbers, but the constraints are small (a and b up to 1000). The while loop runs at most about O(log_b(a)) which is very small.\n\n        Let me test with a=1000, b=2:\n\n            First iteration: hours=1000, leftover=1000 -> new_candles=500, leftover=0\n            Second: hours=1500, leftover=500 -> new_candles=250, leftover=0\n            Third: hours=1750, new_candles=125, leftover=0\n            Fourth: hours=1875, new_candles=62, leftover=1 (because 125//2=62 and 125%2=1)\n            Fifth: hours=1937, leftover=62+1=63 -> 63//2=31, 63%2=1\n            Sixth: hours=1968, leftover=31+1=32 -> 32//2=16, 0\n            Seventh: hours=1984, 16 -> 16//2=8, 0\n            Eighth: hours=1992, 8 -> 8//2=4,0\n            Ninth: 1996, 4->2,0\n            Tenth: 1998,2->1,0\n            Eleventh: 1999,1->0,1 -> break.\n\n            Total hours=1999.\n\n        We can verify: \n            With 1000 candles, we burn 1000 -> 1000 hours, then we get 500 new candles -> burn 500 -> total 1500, then 250 -> 1750, then 125 -> 1875, then 62 -> 1937, then 31 -> 1968, then 16 -> 1984, then 8 -> 1992, then 4->1996, then 2->1998, then 1->1999.\n\n        So the code works.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Vasily acts optimally\". This simulation is optimal because we are burning all available candles at each step.\n\n        Therefore, we can submit this code.\n\n        But wait, there is an alternative approach that uses integer division and avoids a while loop (using recursion or mathematical formula). However, the problem is small enough that the while loop is acceptable.\n\n        We'll stick with the while loop.\n\n        Code:\n\n        Read input, then:\n\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        candles = a\n        leftover = 0\n        hours = 0\n\n        while candles > 0:\n            hours += candles\n            leftover += candles\n            # Convert leftover to new candles\n            new_candles = leftover // b\n            leftover = leftover % b\n            candles = new_candles\n\n        print(hours)\n\n        Let's run the provided examples.\n\n        Example: \"4 2\" -> 7, \"6 3\" -> 8.\n\n        But wait, the example input is given as two separate lines? Or one line with two numbers?\n\n        The problem says: \"The single line contains two integers, a and b\"\n\n        So we read one line.\n\n        However, the example input format in the problem statement is:\n\n        Input\n        ['4 2', '6 3']\n\n        But this is just showing two examples. The actual input is one line per test case.\n\n        Since we are reading from stdin, we read one line.\n\n        Therefore, the code is as below.\n\n        But note: the example input format in the problem statement is shown as a list of strings, but in reality, the input is provided as two numbers in one line.\n\n        We assume the input is one line.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"The single line contains two integers, a and b\".\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Let me run the code with the example inputs.\n\n        Example1: \n            Input: \"4 2\"\n            Output: 7\n\n        Example2:\n            Input: \"6 3\"\n            Output: 8\n\n        We are done.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a=0? The problem says a>=1, so no problem.\n\n        Similarly, b>=2.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Code:\n\n        Read one line, split into two integers, then run the while loop.\n\n        However, there is an alternative: we can use a mathematical approach to avoid the while loop.\n\n        Mathematical approach:\n\n        We can consider that the total number of candles we can burn is the initial a plus the leftover from the first round (a//b) plus the leftover from the second round ( (a//b + a % b) // b ) and so on.\n\n        But note: the total hours is the sum of the candles we burn in each cycle.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        total = 0\n        current = a\n        while current > 0:\n            total += current\n            # The next cycle: we have current burned, which gives current leftovers, so the next current is (current + leftover_from_previous) // b, but we don't have the leftover from previous? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n        total = 0\n        n = a\n        while n:\n            total += n\n            r = n % b\n            n = n // b + r\n\n        This is similar to what we did, but note: we are breaking down the current candles and the leftover from the previous conversion (if any) together.\n\n        But wait, in our simulation we were accumulating the leftover from the burned candles and then converting. Here, we are breaking the current candles and the leftover from the previous cycle (r) and then forming the next cycle.\n\n        Actually, the above is equivalent to:\n\n            n = a\n            total = 0\n            while n:\n                total += n\n                # The next cycle: we can convert the current n into n//b new candles, and we also have the leftover from the previous cycle (if any) which is the remainder from the previous conversion. But wait, in the above code we don't store leftover, we break the current n into quotient and remainder, and then the next n is quotient + remainder.\n\n        But note: the process is that after burning n candles, we get n leftovers, and we combine them with the leftovers from the previous cycle (if any) to form the next cycle's candles.\n\n        However, in the above code we are not storing the leftover from the previous cycle. Instead, we are breaking the current n (which is the number of candles we are going to burn) and then the next n is the number of candles we will burn in the next cycle.\n\n        Actually, the above code is a common solution for such problems.\n\n        Let me test with a=4, b=2:\n\n            n=4\n            total=4\n            r = 4 % 2 = 0, n = 4//2 + 0 = 2\n\n            Then n=2\n            total=6\n            r=0, n=1\n\n            Then n=1\n            total=7\n            r=1, n=0 -> break.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        For a=6, b=3:\n\n            n=6\n            total=6\n            r=0, n=6//3=2\n\n            n=2\n            total=8\n            r=2, n=0+2=2 -> but wait, n=2, then we break because n becomes 2 and then we do:\n\n            Actually, wait: in the code above, we break when n becomes 0. But in the last step, n=2, so we enter the loop:\n\n            total=8+2=10 -> which is wrong.\n\n        So the above alternative code is not the same.\n\n        Why? Because in the alternative code, we are breaking the current n (which is the candles we are going to burn) and then the next n is the new candles we get from conversion, but we are ignoring the fact that the burned candles (n) produce n leftovers that we haven't accounted for in the next cycle.\n\n        Actually, the common solution for the \"New Year Candles\" problem is:\n\n            def solve(a, b):\n                hours = 0\n                while a:\n                    hours += a\n                    a = a // b * (b-1) + a % b   # This is not standard.\n\n        Actually, the standard solution is to use the while loop that we originally wrote, or to use:\n\n            total = 0\n            while a:\n                total += a\n                a = (a // b) * (b-1) + (a % b)\n\n        But wait, no.\n\n        Let me check with a=4, b=2:\n\n            Step0: a=4\n            Step1: total=4, a = (4//2)* (2-1) + (4%2) = 2*1 + 0 = 2\n            Step2: total=6, a = (2//2)*1 + 0 = 1\n            Step3: total=7, a = (1//2)*1 + 1 = 0+1=1 -> infinite loop.\n\n        This is not correct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            total = 0\n            while a:\n                total += a\n                a = (a // b) + (a % b)\n\n        Then for a=4, b=2:\n\n            Step0: a=4\n            Step1: total=4, a = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2+0=2\n            Step2: total=6, a = 2//2+0=1\n            Step3: total=7, a=1//2+1=0+1=1 -> infinite.\n\n        So we must account for the fact that the leftover from the burned candles is the entire a (which is then broken into quotient and remainder) and then the next a is the quotient (number of new candles) plus the remainder (leftover from the conversion) but wait, no: the next a should be the new candles we get (from the conversion) and the leftover from the current burning is already accounted for in the conversion.\n\n        Actually, the correct mathematical formulation is:\n\n            total += a\n            a = (a // b) + (a % b)   # This is the same as our original simulation? \n\n        But in our original simulation, we did:\n\n            leftover += a\n            new_candles = leftover // b\n            leftover = leftover % b\n            a = new_candles\n\n        Which is equivalent to:\n\n            a_next = (a + leftover_prev) // b   [but we don't have leftover_prev stored]\n\n        Actually, we can combine the leftover from the previous steps with the current a. But in the original simulation, we were storing the leftover and then adding the current a to it. \n\n        The above code without storing leftover is:\n\n            total = 0\n            a0 = a\n            while a0:\n                total += a0\n                # The next a0 is the number of new candles we can make, which is (a0 + leftover_prev) // b, but we don't know leftover_prev.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            total = 0\n            while a:\n                total += a\n                # The next a is the number of new candles we can make from the current a (after burning) and the leftover from previous steps?\n                # But note: the burning of a candles produces a leftovers, and we combine them with the leftover from the previous steps (which we don't know) to form the next a.\n\n        We can avoid storing the leftover by keeping track of the leftover separately, but then we are back to the original.\n\n        Since the original simulation is clear and the constraints are small, we'll stick with the original.\n\n        However, there is a known solution for the \"New Year Candles\" problem that uses:\n\n            total = a\n            while a >= b:\n                total += a // b\n                a = a // b + a % b\n\n        But wait, let me test with a=4, b=2:\n\n            total=4\n            while 4>=2: \n                total += 4//2 = 2 -> total=6\n                a = 4//2 + 4%2 = 2+0=2\n\n            Then 2>=2: \n                total += 2//2=1 -> total=7\n                a = 2//2+0=1\n\n            Then 1<2 -> break.\n\n        This gives 7.\n\n        How does this work?\n\n            In the first iteration, we add the number of new candles (which is a//b) to the total hours. But wait, the new candles are burned in subsequent iterations.\n\n            Actually, the total hours is the sum of all candles burned. The initial a is burned, then the a//b new candles are burned, and then the next set.\n\n            But note: the process is that we burn the initial a, then we get a//b new candles and a % b leftover. Then we burn the new candles (which are a//b) and then we have (a//b) burned -> so we get a//b leftovers, and we combine with the previous a % b to get (a//b + a%b) for the next cycle.\n\n            Then we add the next cycle's candles (which is (a//b + a%b)//b) to the total.\n\n            However, in the above code, the total is initially a, then we add a//b, then we set a to (a//b + a%b), then we add that divided by b, etc.\n\n            But wait, the above code does not account for the fact that the new candles from the first cycle are burned in the next cycle, so we are adding the initial a and then the new candles from the first cycle (a//b) and then the new candles from the second cycle (which is (a//b + a%b)//b) and so on.\n\n            However, the total hours is the sum of all candles burned, which is the initial a plus the new candles from the first cycle (a//b) plus the new candles from the second cycle ( (a//b + a%b)//b ) etc.\n\n            But note: the initial a is burned in the first cycle, then the new candles from the first cycle are burned in the second cycle, and so on.\n\n            So the total hours is the sum of all the candles burned in each cycle.\n\n            This is equivalent to:\n\n                total = 0\n                while a:\n                    # Burn all the current candles (a) -> adds a hours\n                    total += a\n                    # Then we get a new supply of candles from the burned ones: floor(a/b) and a % b leftover.\n                    # Then we set a to the new supply: floor(a/b) + a % b\n\n            But wait, that is exactly the same as the original simulation.\n\n            However, the code above does:\n\n                total = a   [then enters the loop and adds a//b, then sets a to a//b + a%b, etc.]\n\n            Let me write the same process without initializing total to a:\n\n            total = 0\n            a = a_initial\n            while a:\n                total += a\n                a = (a // b) + (a % b)\n\n            Then for a=4, b=2:\n\n                total=0, a=4\n                total=4, a= (4//2)+(4%2)=2+0=2\n                total=6, a=(2//2)+0=1\n                total=7, a=(1//2)+1=0+1=1 -> then total=8, a= (1//2)+1=1 -> infinite.\n\n            So that is not the same.\n\n            The known solution (from other people's code) for the \"New Year Candles\" problem is:\n\n                def candles(a, b):\n                    res = 0\n                    while a >= b:\n                        res += a\n                        a = a // b + a % b\n                    res += a\n                    return res\n\n            But wait, let me test with a=4, b=2:\n\n                while 4>=2: \n                    res=4, a= (4//2)+(4%2)=2+0=2\n                then since 2>=2: \n                    res=4+2=6, a= (2//2)+0=1\n                then 1<2, so break and add a=1 -> res=7.\n\n            But the code above does:\n\n                def candles(a, b):\n                    res = 0\n                    while a >= b:\n                        res += a\n                        a = a // b + a % b\n                    res += a\n                    return res\n\n            This gives 7 for (4,2).\n\n            Now for (6,3):\n\n                while 6>=3:\n                    res=6, a=6//3+6%3=2+0=2\n                then 2<3, so break and add a=2 -> res=8.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            But why is that? \n\n            Explanation:\n\n            The while loop runs as long as we have at least b candles (so we can make at least one new candle). In each iteration, we burn all the current candles (adding a to the result) and then set a to the number of new candles we can make (which is a//b) plus the leftover (a % b). Note: the leftover from burning the current candles is a % b, and the new candles we make is a//b.\n\n            Then, when the loop breaks (a < b), we have a leftover amount of candles (which we cannot convert) and we can burn them (each one gives one hour). So we add a to the result.\n\n            This is equivalent to our original simulation, but written differently.\n\n            However, note: in the original simulation, we did:\n\n                candles = a\n                leftover = 0\n                hours = 0\n\n                while candles > 0:\n                    hours += candles\n                    leftover += candles\n                    new_candles = leftover // b\n                    leftover = leftover % b\n                    candles = new_candles\n\n            In the known solution, we do:\n\n                res = 0\n                while a >= b:\n                    res += a\n                    a = a//b + a % b   # This is the total number of candles we will have for the next cycle (which is the new candles from conversion and the leftover from burning the current a)\n\n                res += a\n\n            Why is this the same?\n\n            Let me compare:\n\n            Original:\n\n                Step0: a=4, b=2\n                candles=4, leftover=0\n                hours=4, leftover=4\n                new_candles = 4//2=2, leftover=0\n                candles=2",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can light up his room using candles, given that he starts with `a` new candles and can convert `b` burned-out candles into a new one. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and converting leftovers into new candles until no more candles can be burned.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given number of candles (`a`) and initialize the total hours to zero.\n2. **Burning Candles**: While there are candles available (either new or converted from leftovers), burn all of them. Each candle provides one hour of light.\n3. **Conversion**: After burning the candles, calculate how many new candles can be made from the burned-out ones. Specifically, every `b` burned-out candles can be converted into one new candle. The remaining burned-out candles that couldn't be converted remain as leftovers for future cycles.\n4. **Update Candles**: Set the number of candles to the newly converted ones and repeat the process until fewer than `b` burned-out candles remain, making conversion impossible.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the burning and recycling process, ensuring optimal use of all available candles to maximize the total illumination time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    while a >= b:\n        total += a\n        a = a // b + a % b\n    total += a\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of burned-out candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Loop for Burning and Converting**: The loop continues as long as there are at least `b` candles. In each iteration:\n   - The current number of candles (`a`) is added to the total hours (`total`).\n   - The number of new candles that can be made is calculated as `a // b`, and the leftover burned-out candles are `a % b`. The sum of these two values gives the new number of candles for the next iteration.\n3. **Final Burn**: After the loop exits (when `a` is less than `b`), any remaining candles (`a`) are burned, adding their count to the total hours.\n4. **Output**: The total hours are printed, representing the maximum time the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging simple arithmetic operations within a loop, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
