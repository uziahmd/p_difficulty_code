Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can use any number of additional cards, each with an integer from -x to x (excluding 0? Actually including 0? But note: the problem says \"each card\" doesn't exceed x in absolute value, so from -x to x inclusive.\n\n However, note: the problem says that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x.\n\n We want the minimum number of additional cards such that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Calculate the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. The additional cards must be chosen from the set {-x, -x+1, ..., x}. Note that we can use zeros as well, but zeros don't help in changing the sum.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to choose any number of cards (from the infinite set) with numbers in [-x, x]. But we want the minimum number.\n\n Observation:\n Let S = current sum.\n\n We need to achieve a total sum of 0. So the additional cards must have a total sum of -S.\n\n But note: we can also consider that maybe we don't need to fix the entire deficit at once because we can use multiple cards.\n\n Since we can choose any number of cards (each between -x and x), we are effectively looking for the smallest k (nonnegative integer) such that there exist integers a1, a2, ... , ak (each in [-x, x]) satisfying:\n   a1 + a2 + ... + ak = -S\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use any integer in the range. Also, we are minimizing the number of cards.\n\n We can think greedily:\n\n Case 1: If the current sum is already zero, then we need 0 additional cards.\n\n Case 2: Otherwise, we need to cover the deficit (which is -S). But note: the deficit can be positive or negative. Let deficit = -S.\n\n However, we can break it into two cases: when deficit is positive and negative, but note: if deficit is negative then we need to add negative numbers, so we can just take absolute value? Actually, let's reframe:\n\n We need to achieve a total sum of 0, so we need to add a set of numbers that sum to -S. Without loss of generality, we can consider the absolute value of the deficit, but note: the numbers we can use are bounded by x.\n\n Important: We can use both positive and negative numbers arbitrarily (as long as they are in [-x,x]). But we want to minimize the number of cards.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let d = |S| (the absolute value of the current sum). We need to cover d with a combination of numbers each between -x and x.\n\n However, note: we can use positive and negative numbers arbitrarily. But the goal is to cancel out the current sum. \n\n Actually, we can think: \n   If S is positive, then we need to add negative numbers (or a mix that results in a negative sum). Similarly, if S is negative, we need positive numbers.\n\n But wait: we are allowed to use any numbers. However, using zeros doesn't help. We are minimizing the number of cards.\n\n Let T = -S (the amount we need to add). Then we need to write T as a sum of k numbers, each in [-x, x], and we want the smallest k.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require the additional cards to be non-zero. But zeros don't help, so we can ignore zeros.\n\n But note: sometimes zeros might be used? Actually, no: because if we use a zero, it doesn't change the sum. So we can assume we only use non-zero cards.\n\n However, wait: what if we need to cover T=0? Then we don't need any card. But our T is -S, so if S=0 then T=0.\n\n How to solve for T?\n\n We can use the following:\n\n Since we can use any integer in [-x, x] (and we are minimizing the number of cards), we can use:\n\n   k_min = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n But wait: is that always valid?\n\n Example: \n   First sample: n=3, x=2, cards = [-1, 1, 2] -> current sum = 2, so T = -2. Then |T|=2, and ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1. Correct.\n\n   Second sample: n=2, x=3, cards = [-2,-2] -> current sum = -4, so T = 4. Then ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.33) = 2. Correct.\n\n However, consider: can we always achieve T by k_min cards?\n\n But note: we can use positive and negative numbers. However, if T is positive, then we can use only positive numbers (if we are going to cover a positive deficit, we need to add negative numbers? Wait, let me clarify:\n\n Actually, T = -S. In the second sample, S=-4, so T=4. Then we need to add cards that sum to 4. We can use two cards of 2 (each 2 is within [ -3, 3 ]). \n\n But what if T is negative? Then we need to add cards that sum to a negative number.\n\n However, the above formula uses absolute value. But note: the formula ceil(|T|/x) works because:\n\n   - If T is positive, then we can use positive cards (if we are allowed to use positive cards to cover a positive T, but wait: actually, we need to add a negative sum to cancel a positive S. Or is it the other way?\n\n Let me re-express:\n\n   We have current sum S, we want to add cards with total sum = -S.\n\n   Let T = -S.\n\n   We need to represent T as the sum of k integers, each in [-x, x].\n\n   Now, if T is positive, then we can use positive cards (because positive cards will add to T). But note: we can also use negative cards? That would reduce T. However, we are free to use any numbers. But to minimize the number of cards, we would use as many positive cards as needed (if T is positive) or negative cards (if T is negative). \n\n   However, the problem is symmetric: we can use the same reasoning for positive and negative by taking absolute value.\n\n   But note: the maximum absolute value of one card is x. Therefore, to achieve a total absolute value of |T|, we cannot do better than ceil(|T|/x).\n\n   Why? Because the maximum absolute value we can get from one card is x. So to achieve |T|, we need at least ceil(|T|/x) cards (if we use all cards with the same sign as T). \n\n   However, we must check: is it always possible to achieve T with exactly ceil(|T|/x) cards?\n\n   Consider: \n      We can use k = ceil(|T|/x) cards, and we can assign each card to be either the same sign as T or the opposite? Actually, we are free to use any numbers.\n\n   But note: we are constrained by the range [-x, x]. \n\n   Let k = ceil(|T|/x). Then we can represent T with k cards if:\n\n        If T is positive: we can use k-1 cards with value x and one card with value (T - (k-1)*x). But note: (T - (k-1)*x) must be in [-x, x]. However, by the definition of ceiling:\n\n        Let k = ceil(|T|/x) => k-1 < |T|/x <= k.\n\n        Then (k-1)*x < |T| <= k*x.\n\n        For T positive: \n            We require T <= k*x (which holds) and we require T - (k-1)*x <= x (which is true because T <= k*x and (k-1)*x + x = k*x >= T, so T - (k-1)*x <= x). Also, T - (k-1)*x >= 0 (because T>=0 and (k-1)*x <= T). And since T - (k-1)*x <= x, we have the last card is between 0 and x, which is acceptable.\n\n        Similarly, if T is negative, we can use k-1 cards with value -x and one card with value (T + (k-1)*x). But wait, T negative: then |T| = -T, so k = ceil(-T/x). Then we require:\n\n            k-1 < (-T)/x <= k   =>   (k-1)*x < -T <= k*x.\n\n            Then the last card: T + (k-1)*x = (k-1)*x + T = (k-1)*x - |T|. And we require this value to be >= -x.\n\n            Since (k-1)*x < |T|, then (k-1)*x - |T| < 0, and the absolute value is |T| - (k-1)*x. And from the ceiling condition, |T| - (k-1)*x <= x (because |T| <= k*x, so |T| - (k-1)*x <= k*x - (k-1)*x = x). Also, since |T| > (k-1)*x, then |T| - (k-1)*x > 0? Not necessarily: wait, we have (k-1)*x < |T|, so |T| - (k-1)*x > 0. But wait, then the last card is negative? Actually, no: because T is negative, we are adding (k-1)*x (positive) and then T (negative). But note: we are representing T (negative) by having (k-1) negative cards? Actually, we did:\n\n            Alternatively, we can use k-1 cards of -x and then one card of (T + (k-1)*x). Since T is negative, and (k-1)*x is positive, but we know |T| > (k-1)*x, so T + (k-1)*x = (k-1)*x + T is negative? Because (k-1)*x + T = (k-1)*x - |T|, and since (k-1)*x < |T|, then (k-1)*x - |T| is negative. And its absolute value is |T| - (k-1)*x <= x (by the ceiling condition). So the last card is in the range [-x,0] (since it's negative and at least -x). \n\n        However, wait: the example above for positive T used positive cards. For negative T, we can use negative cards. But note: the set [-x,x] includes positive and negative. So we can use a mix? Actually, we don't need to mix because we are only concerned with the total sum.\n\n        But the above reasoning for negative T: we are using k-1 negative cards and one negative card (the last one) to make the total negative. Alternatively, we could use some positive and negative? But that wouldn't minimize the number of cards because we are already achieving the target with k cards.\n\n        However, note: what if we use a mix? Actually, we don't need to because the minimal number of cards is determined by the maximum absolute value per card. The ceiling division by x (in absolute value) gives the minimal k.\n\n        But wait: is there a case where we cannot achieve T with k = ceil(|T|/x) cards? \n\n        Example: T=1, x=2 -> ceil(1/2)=1. Then we can use one card with 1, which is in [-2,2]. So yes.\n\n        Another: T=3, x=2 -> ceil(3/2)=2. Then we can use two cards: 2 and 1, but wait, 1 is allowed. Alternatively, we can use two cards: 2 and 1. But note: we can use two cards: 2 and 1, but 1 is positive and 2 is positive. Or two cards of 2? Then 2+2=4, which is too much. But wait, we don't require the cards to be positive. Actually, we can use one card of 2 and one card of 1, and that is two cards. But we can also use one card of 3? But wait, the card must be in [-2,2]. So 3 is not allowed. So we must use two cards. But 2+1=3, which is allowed because 1 is in the range.\n\n        However, note: the above formula only considered using all positive (or all negative) cards. But we can use a mix. But the minimal k is still ceil(|T|/x). \n\n        Why is that? Because the maximum absolute value we can cover with k cards is k*x (if we use k cards each of absolute value x). And we need |T| <= k*x. The minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|, which is k = ceil(|T|/x).\n\n        But note: we are allowed to use both positive and negative. However, the minimal k is still the same because we are bounded by the maximum absolute value per card.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          k = ceil(|T| / x)   if T != 0.\n\n        However, wait: what if T=0? Then k=0.\n\n        But note: we can also consider that we might use fewer cards by using a combination that cancels the current sum? Actually, the above reasoning holds.\n\n        However, wait: there is a catch. What if the current sum is zero? Then T=0, so k=0.\n\n        But note: the problem allows the use of zero cards.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n          Read n and x.\n          Read the list of n integers.\n\n          S = sum(list)\n          T = -S\n\n          If T == 0:\n              print(0)\n          Else:\n              k = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n          However, wait: what if we have negative T? The absolute value takes care.\n\n        But wait: is that really the minimal?\n\n        Let me test with the examples:\n\n          Example 1: n=3, x=2, cards = [-1,1,2] -> S=2, T=-2 -> |T|=2, ceil(2/2)=1 -> correct.\n\n          Example 2: n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> S=-4, T=4, ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> correct.\n\n        But consider another example: \n          n=1, x=5, cards=[3] -> S=3, T=-3, ceil(3/5)=1 -> we can use one card: -3 (which is in [-5,5]). Correct.\n\n        However, consider: \n          n=1, x=5, cards=[0] -> S=0, T=0, so 0 cards. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is not an integer? Actually, the input integers are integers, so S is integer, T is integer.\n\n        However, the problem says: the numbers on the found cards are integers, and x is integer.\n\n        But note: the above formula uses absolute value and ceiling. Since |T| and x are integers, then |T|/x might not be an integer, so we need to compute the ceiling.\n\n        How to compute ceiling of a division of two positive integers a and b?\n          ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b   when a and b are positive.\n\n        But note: |T| is nonnegative, and x is positive.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: if T is negative, we take absolute value. So we are dealing with nonnegative |T|.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          deficit = abs(S)   # because T = -S, so |T| = |S|\n          But wait: T = -S, so |T| = |S|. So we can also say: we need to cover |S|.\n\n        Actually, let me define:\n\n          current_sum = S\n          deficit = abs(S)\n\n        Then the minimal number of cards is ceil(deficit / x)\n\n        However, wait: is that always true? \n\n        Example: \n          S = 0 -> deficit=0, ceil(0/x)=0 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we need 0.\n\n        However, consider: \n          Example: S=4, x=3 -> deficit=4, ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2.\n\n          We can use two cards: 3 and 1 (if 1 is allowed) -> but wait, 1 is allowed (since 1<=3). But note: we can also use two cards: 3 and 1, or even two cards: 2 and 2? \n\n        But wait, the formula is about the minimal k such that k*x >= deficit. \n\n        However, note: we are allowed to use any numbers in [-x, x]. The maximum absolute value we can get from one card is x. So the maximum absolute value we can get from k cards is k*x. But we are not forced to use the same sign? Actually, we can use both positive and negative, but the total absolute value we need to cover is deficit (if S is positive, we need to add negative numbers, so the total negative sum must be -S, which has absolute value S). \n\n        However, note: the absolute value of the sum of the additional cards must be at least deficit (if we are to cancel the current sum). But wait, the minimal absolute value we can achieve with k cards is 0 (by using zeros) but that doesn't help. The key is that the total sum must be -S (so absolute value deficit). \n\n        But note: the minimal k must satisfy that the maximum absolute value we can get from k cards is k*x, and we need k*x >= deficit. So k_min = ceil(deficit/x).\n\n        However, there is a caveat: what if we don't need to use the same sign for all? \n\n        Example: deficit=5, x=3 -> k_min = ceil(5/3)=2. Can we achieve 5 (if S=-5, then we need to add 5) with two cards? Yes: 3 and 2 (both positive). Or 3 and 2 are allowed because 2<=3.\n\n        But wait: what if we have deficit=5, x=3, but we are allowed to use negative cards? Actually, we don't need negative cards in this case because we are trying to add a positive total (to cancel a negative current sum). Similarly, if the current sum is positive, we need to add negative total.\n\n        However, the minimal k is the same regardless of the sign because we can use positive cards for positive deficit and negative cards for negative deficit.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          k = ceil(|S| / x)   if S != 0, but wait: no, we defined T=-S, and |T|=|S|.\n\n        Actually, we can simplify:\n\n          Let d = abs(S)\n          Then k = ceil(d / x)\n\n        But wait: what if d==0? Then k=0.\n\n        However, consider: what if the current sum is 0? Then we don't need any card. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is not zero, but the deficit can be achieved by fewer cards if we use a mix of positive and negative? \n\n        Example: \n          S = 5, x = 3 -> deficit=5, ceil(5/3)=2. With two cards: maximum negative we can get is -6 (two cards of -3) but that would give a total negative of -6, which is too negative. However, we need a total negative of -5.\n\n          We can use two cards: one card of -3 and one card of -2 -> total -5. So two cards.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use three cards: for example, two cards of -3 and one card of +1 -> total -5? But wait, that's three cards, which is more than two.\n\n          So two is minimal.\n\n        But wait, what if we use one card? One card must be between -3 and 3, so the closest we can get is -3, which leaves 2 (still positive). Then we need more.\n\n        So two is indeed minimal.\n\n        However, note: the above reasoning for positive deficit (S positive) we need to add negative numbers. Similarly, for negative deficit we need positive numbers.\n\n        But wait: is there a possibility that using both positive and negative cards can lead to a cancellation that requires fewer cards? \n\n        Example: \n          Suppose we have S = 1, and x=2. Then deficit=1, ceil(1/2)=1. We can use one card: -1. Correct.\n\n        Example: \n          S = 3, x=2 -> deficit=3, ceil(3/2)=2. We can use two cards: -2 and -1. Or two cards: -2 and -1. \n\n        Example: \n          S = 4, x=2 -> deficit=4, ceil(4/2)=2. But wait, 2*2=4, so two cards: two -2's. Correct.\n\n        Example: \n          S = 5, x=2 -> deficit=5, ceil(5/2)=3. Three cards: three -2's would be -6, but we can do two -2 and one -1: total -5. So three cards.\n\n        Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n        However, wait: what if the deficit is very large? \n\n        Example: deficit=10, x=3 -> ceil(10/3)=ceil(3.33)=4. \n          We need to cover 10 with four cards, each at most 3. Maximum we can cover is 4*3=12, which is >=10. And indeed, we can use three 3's and one 1: 3+3+3+1=10.\n\n        But wait: we need negative numbers if S is positive? Actually, if S is positive, we need to add negative numbers. So we are subtracting. So for S=10, we need to add cards that sum to -10. Then we need four cards: each card can be at most -3. So four cards of -3: -12, which is less than -10. Then we can adjust: three cards of -3 and one card of -1: total -10.\n\n        So the formula still holds.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n          Read n and x.\n          Read the list of n integers.\n\n          s = sum(list)\n          d = abs(s)\n\n          if d == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              # Compute k = ceil(d / x)\n              # Since d and x are integers, we can do: (d + x - 1) // x\n              k = (d + x - 1) // x\n              print(k)\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is negative? Then d = abs(s) is positive, so same.\n\n        However, wait: consider the example where the deficit is 0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n        But note: the above formula for ceiling: \n            (d + x - 1) // x\n\n        Example: d=2, x=2 -> (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (integer floor division) -> correct.\n\n        Example: d=3, x=2 -> (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        Example: d=4, x=3 -> (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if d=0?\n            (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x = 0 (for x>=1) -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can write without an if:\n\n          k = (abs(s) + x - 1) // x\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is zero? Then abs(s)=0, and (0+x-1)//x = (x-1)//x. Since x>=1, then (x-1)//x is 0 when x>=1 (because x-1 < x, so integer division by x is 0). Correct.\n\n        However, let me test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n            n=3, x=2, cards=[-1,1,2] -> s = -1+1+2 = 2, d=2, k=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (in Python, 3//2 is 1) -> correct.\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            n=2, x=3, cards=[-2,-2] -> s=-4, d=4, k=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: the example output for the first sample is 1, and for the second sample is 2.\n\n        However, wait: what if the deficit is not an integer? Actually, s is integer because the inputs are integers.\n\n        But wait: what if we have fractional deficit? No, because s is integer.\n\n        However, wait: there is an alternative scenario. What if the current sum is zero? Then we output 0.\n\n        But note: there is a catch! \n\n        Consider: \n          We are allowed to use any integer from -x to x. But what if the deficit is 0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n        However, what if the deficit is non-zero, but we can achieve the required sum with zero cards? No, then we need at least one card.\n\n        But wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n        But note: the above formula uses the absolute value of the current sum. However, what if the current sum is negative? Then we need to add positive numbers. The same formula applies.\n\n        However, wait: is there a possibility that we can use fewer cards by using both positive and negative? \n\n        Example: \n          Current sum = 1, x=1. Then deficit=1, k=ceil(1/1)=1. Correct.\n\n        Example: \n          Current sum = 1, x=2. Then deficit=1, k=ceil(1/2)=1. Correct.\n\n        Example: \n          Current sum = 2, x=1. Then deficit=2, k=ceil(2/1)=2. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is 0, but we have an odd number of cards? Actually, the sum being 0 is independent of the number of cards.\n\n        However, wait: there is a different interpretation. The problem says: Vanya wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. He has found n cards. He can find additional cards (any number) from the set of integers in [-x, x].\n\n        But note: the problem asks for the minimum number of additional cards.\n\n        The above reasoning is correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example in the note: \n          Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> Output: 2.\n\n        But what if we consider: \n          We have two cards: [-2,-2] -> sum=-4.\n          We need to add cards so that the total becomes 0. So we need to add 4.\n\n          We can use two cards: two 2's. Each 2 is in [-3,3]. So two cards.\n\n        But wait: the example output is 2.\n\n        However, wait: what if we use one card? One card must be an integer in [-3,3]. The maximum positive we can add is 3. Then the total becomes -4+3=-1, which is not zero. Then we need two cards.\n\n        Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\n        But wait: I just realized: the above reasoning is based on the absolute value of the deficit. However, the deficit is the absolute value of the current sum. But note: the additional cards can be positive or negative. However, the minimal number of cards is determined by the requirement to cover the deficit (in absolute value) with cards of maximum absolute value x.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is negative? Then we need to add positive numbers. But the maximum positive we can add per card is x. So the minimal number of cards is the same as if the current sum were positive.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(cards)\n          d = abs(s)\n          # If d==0, then we need 0 cards, but the formula (d+x-1)//x will also give 0.\n          k = (d + x - 1) // x\n          print(k)\n\n        However, wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then k=0, which is correct.\n\n        But wait: consider the example where the current sum is 0, but the cards are non-zero. Then we don't need any additional card. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is not zero, but we can use a combination of positive and negative cards to achieve the total sum zero with fewer cards? \n\n        Example: \n          Current sum = 3, x=2. \n          Our formula: d=3, k=ceil(3/2)=2.\n\n          With two cards: we can use one card of 2 and one card of 1 (positive) to make the total 3+2+1=6, but that's not zero. \n\n          Wait, no: we are allowed to use negative cards. We need to add cards that sum to -3. \n\n          We can use two cards: one -2 and one -1 -> total -3. Then the overall sum becomes 3 + (-3)=0.\n\n          So two cards.\n\n        But wait, what if we use three cards? \n          Example: three cards: -1, -1, -1 -> total -3. Then three cards. But two is better.\n\n        So the minimal is two.\n\n        But wait, what if we use one card? One card must be between -2 and 2. The closest we can get to -3 is -2, then the total becomes 3-2=1, which is not zero. Then we need two cards.\n\n        Therefore, the formula is correct.\n\n        However, wait: there is a more subtle issue. The problem states that the initial set of cards included every integer from -x to x. But note: we are allowed to use any integer in that range. The above reasoning holds.\n\n        But wait: what if the deficit is 1, and x=1? Then k=ceil(1/1)=1. Correct.\n\n        What if the deficit is 1, and x=2? Then k=ceil(1/2)=1. Correct.\n\n        What if the deficit is 2, and x=2? Then k=ceil(2/2)=1. Correct.\n\n        What if the deficit is 3, and x=2? Then k=ceil(3/2)=2. Correct.\n\n        What if the deficit is 4, and x=2? Then k=ceil(4/2)=2. Correct.\n\n        What if the deficit is 5, and x=2? Then k=ceil(5/2)=3. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          d = abs(s)\n          # If d==0, then k=0, else k = ceil(d/x)\n          # Using integer arithmetic: ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b for positive a and b.\n          k = (d + x - 1) // x\n          print(k)\n\n        However, wait: the problem statement says the first line has two integers: n and x. Then the second line has n integers.\n\n        But note: the example input format: \n          ['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n        We are reading the first line with two integers, then the second line with n integers.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But wait: what if n=0? The problem says n>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n        However, wait: I just saw the example input: \n          Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n\n        We read n=3, x=2, and then the next line has three integers.\n\n        But wait: the example input string is given as: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\", meaning we read two tokens in the first line: '3' and '2', then the next line is \"-1 1 2\".\n\n        This is standard.\n\n        Let me run through the example:\n\n          n=3, x=2, arr = [-1,1,2]\n\n          s = -1+1+2 = 2\n          d = 2\n          k = (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (in integer division)\n\n        Print 1.\n\n        Second example:\n\n          n=2, x=3, arr = [-2,-2]\n\n          s = -4\n          d = 4\n          k = (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2\n\n        Print 2.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          d = abs(s)\n          k = (d + x - 1) // x\n          print(k)\n\n        But wait: wait a minute! There is a flaw.\n\n        The above reasoning assumed that the minimal number of cards is ceil(|S|/x). However, note that the additional cards can be any integers in [-x, x]. But the total sum we need to add is -S. \n\n        However, the minimal number of cards is not necessarily ceil(|S|/x) because we are allowed to use negative and positive cards arbitrarily. \n\n        Example: \n          Current sum = 1, x=3. \n          Then deficit=1, k=ceil(1/3)=1. Correct.\n\n        But what if the current sum is 0? Then k=0.\n\n        However, consider: \n          Current sum = 0, but we have n=0? No, n>=1. But the sum could be zero.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is 0? Then we don't need any card.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is 0, but we are forced to use at least one card? No, the problem says we can use any number of additional cards (including zero).\n\n        But wait: there is a different possibility. The problem says: \"minimum number of cards does he need to find\". \n\n        However, what if the current sum is 0, then we need 0.\n\n        But wait: consider the following: \n\n          The problem says: \"the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero\". \n\n          Initially, he found n cards. Then he can find more. \n\n          If the current n cards already sum to zero, then we need 0.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current n cards do not sum to zero, but we can use negative and positive to cancel out the current sum? \n\n        The above formula is correct.\n\n        But wait, I see an issue: \n\n          Example: \n            n=1, x=10, cards=[5] -> deficit=5, k=ceil(5/10)=1. Correct: use one card of -5.\n\n          Example: \n            n=2, x=10, cards=[5,5] -> deficit=10, k=ceil(10/10)=1. Correct: use one card of -10.\n\n          Example: \n            n=2, x=10, cards=[5,5] -> we can also use two cards: -5 and -5. But that would be two cards, which is worse.\n\n        So the minimal is 1.\n\n        But wait: is -10 allowed? Yes, because x=10, so from -10 to 10. So -10 is allowed.\n\n        However, wait: what if the deficit is 11, x=10? \n          k = ceil(11/10)=2. \n          We can use two cards: -10 and -1 -> total -11. Correct.\n\n        But wait: the problem says the card numbers are integers from -x to x. So -1 is allowed.\n\n        Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n        However, wait: what if the deficit is 0? Then we use 0 cards. Correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the deficit is 0, but we have non-zero cards? Then the current sum is 0, so we don't need any card.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, wait: I just thought of an example where the deficit is very small but the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on the found cards equals zero. The initial set of found cards has a certain sum, and we can add any number of cards, each with an integer value between -x and x (inclusive), to balance the sum to zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the additional cards must be exactly the negative of the current sum of the found cards. The minimal number of cards required to achieve this is determined by the absolute value of the current sum divided by the maximum absolute value of a single card (x). This is because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) towards reducing the deficit (the absolute value of the current sum).\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards needed is the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the current sum by x. This is derived from the fact that each card can adjust the sum by at most x units. For example, if the current sum is 5 and x is 3, we need at least two cards (since one card can only adjust by up to 3 units, leaving a remainder of 2 which requires a second card).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves calculating the current sum of the found cards, taking its absolute value, and then computing the ceiling of this value divided by x. The ceiling operation ensures we round up to the nearest integer, as even a partial adjustment requires an additional card.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves a simple sum calculation over n elements and a constant-time ceiling division operation. Thus, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    s = sum(arr)\n    d = abs(s)\n    k = (d + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, n (number of found cards) and x (maximum absolute value of a card). The second line contains n integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. If this sum is zero, no additional cards are needed (output is 0).\n3. **Deficit Calculation**: The absolute value of the sum is taken to determine the deficit that needs to be balanced by the additional cards.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: The minimal number of cards required is calculated using the formula `(d + x - 1) // x`, which effectively computes the ceiling of `d / x` without floating-point operations.\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, representing the minimum number of additional cards needed to make the total sum zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages basic arithmetic operations to solve the problem with optimal performance.",
