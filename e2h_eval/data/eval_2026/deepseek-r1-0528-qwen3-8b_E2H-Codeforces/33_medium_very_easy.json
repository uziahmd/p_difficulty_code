You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105.

    "thought": "\n We are allowed to replace at most m digits (each element in s can be used at most once) but we can choose which ones to use.\n The goal is to maximize the number.\n\n Observation:\n We want to replace digits in a from left to right because a digit in a more significant position has a greater impact on the overall value.\n\n However, note: \n  - We cannot introduce leading zeros. But since the original number doesn't have leading zeros, and we are replacing digits arbitrarily (but we can only use each element of s once), we must be cautious.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We have two strings: the original number 'a' (with no leading zeros) and the string 's' (which is a sequence of digits).\n\n 2. We are allowed to use each element in 's' at most once, and we can choose which positions to replace.\n\n 3. Strategy:\n    We want to assign the largest available digits from s to the leftmost positions first, but note: sometimes we might not want to use a large digit if it leads to a lower digit in a higher place? Actually, we want to maximize the entire number.\n\n    However, consider: \n        Example: a = \"1024\", s = \"010\"\n        Possibilities: \n            We have three digits: '0', '1', '0'\n            We can replace one or two digits? But note: we can use each element at most once, but we can choose which ones.\n\n        We can do:\n            Replace the first digit (if we replace with a digit that is larger than the current one, then we get a bigger number). \n            However, if we replace the first digit with '1' (from s) then we get \"1024\" -> same as original? Actually, we can also replace the second digit: \n                Option 1: Replace first digit: original first digit is '1'. We have a '1' in s. Then we would replace the first digit with '1' -> same, so no change.\n                Option 2: Replace the second digit: original second digit is '0'. We have a '1' and two '0's. If we replace the second digit with '1', then we get \"1124\", which is better.\n\n        So the idea: we want to replace a digit at position i (0-indexed) with a digit d (from s) if d > the current digit at i. But we have limited digits.\n\n    But note: we might have multiple replacements. We can choose which digits from s to use and in which order (but we can assign any digit from s to any position arbitrarily, as long as we don't reuse an element).\n\n    However, we must not break the condition of having no leading zeros. But note: if we are replacing the very first digit, then we cannot replace it with a digit that is '0' (unless the number becomes 0? but original has no leading zeros and we are replacing only one digit, so if we replace the first digit with '0' then the number would have a leading zero. However, the problem says the printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n    Therefore, we must avoid replacing the first digit with '0' if that would lead to a leading zero. But note: the original number doesn't have leading zeros, so the first digit is non-zero. If we replace the first digit with '0', then we would have a leading zero, which is not allowed. So we should never replace the first digit with '0'? Actually, we can leave it as the original non-zero digit. So for the first digit, we can only replace it if we have a digit that is greater than the current one and non-zero? Actually, we can replace the first digit with a non-zero digit that is greater than the current one.\n\n    But what if we have a digit '0' in s? We can use it for a later position.\n\n    Approach:\n\n    We are allowed to use each element of s at most once, and we can choose which positions to replace.\n\n    We can do:\n\n    Step 1: Precompute the available digits (count of each digit from 9 down to 0) in s. But note: we have to use the best digits first.\n\n    However, we are constrained by the fact that we can only replace a digit if we have a digit in s that is greater than the current one. And we want to do this from left to right.\n\n    Alternate approach:\n\n    We have two arrays: \n        a_digits = list of digits of a (as integers or characters)\n        s_digits = list of digits of s (as integers or characters)\n\n    We can sort s_digits in descending order? But wait, we are allowed to use each at most once.\n\n    However, we are allowed to choose which positions to replace. We want to maximize the number.\n\n    We can try:\n\n        For each position from left to right (starting at index 0), we try to replace the digit with the largest available digit that is greater than the current digit. But if we do that, we use one occurrence of that digit and remove it from the available set.\n\n    However, the catch: we might save a large digit for a later position that might be more beneficial? Actually, no: because the leftmost digit has the highest weight. So we want to assign the largest available digit that is greater than the current one to the current position, and then move to the next.\n\n    But wait: consider two possibilities:\n\n        Example: a = \"19\", s = \"98\"\n\n        If we assign the '9' to the first digit: then we get \"99\", which is good.\n        Alternatively, if we assign the '8' to the first digit: then we get \"89\", which is worse than using '9'.\n\n        Now, what if we have two digits: a = \"12\", s = \"39\"\n\n        Option 1: Replace the first digit with '9' -> \"92\" (good)\n        Option 2: Replace the first digit with '3' -> \"32\" (bad) so we wouldn't do that.\n\n        But what if we have a = \"12\", s = \"39\", and we are forced to use two digits? Actually, we are allowed to use at most two, but we don't have to. We want the maximum.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n        Let's have an array (or multiset) of the digits in s. We can use a frequency array for digits 0-9.\n\n        Then, traverse the number from left to right (from the most significant to least):\n\n            For the current digit (at position i), we look for the largest digit d in s (that we haven't used) such that d > current_digit.\n\n            If we find one, then we use that digit, remove one occurrence of that digit from the frequency array, and set the current digit to d.\n\n            If we don't find any digit greater than the current_digit, then we leave the digit as is (and move on).\n\n        However, is this greedy safe?\n\n        Consider: \n            a = \"123\", s = \"987654\"\n\n            We want to replace the first digit: the largest digit in s that is > '1' is '9'. Then we replace, and then the next digit: the remaining s has digits [8,7,6,5,4] and current digit is '2'. The largest digit >2 is '8'. Then we get \"983\", which is correct.\n\n        But consider: \n            a = \"155\", s = \"999\"\n\n            We want to replace the first digit: we have '9' (largest) so we replace first digit: becomes '9'. Then for the second digit: we have two '9's, so we replace the second digit with '9', then the third digit: same. We get \"999\".\n\n        However, what if we have a = \"199\", s = \"98\"?\n\n            Without the greedy: \n                First digit: current is '1'. The available digits are ['9','8'] -> the largest is '9' (which is >1) so we use '9': becomes \"999\".\n            But wait, we have two digits in s: we can use both. \n\n            But what if we have a = \"199\", s = \"98\": \n                We have two digits: '9' and '8'. \n                First digit: replace with '9' -> becomes \"999\". Then we have one digit left: '8'. But the next digits are already '9' (which is greater than '8') so we don't need to use it. So we stop.\n\n            Another example: \n                a = \"199\", s = \"89\": \n                First digit: we have '9' and '8'. The largest digit greater than '1' is '9'. Then we use '9' -> \"999\", and then we have '8' left. Then we look at the second digit: current is '9' (from original) but now we have replaced the first digit. The second digit is still '9' (original) and we have an '8'. Since 8 < 9, we don't replace. Similarly the third digit.\n\n            But wait: what if we don't use the '9' for the first digit? \n                Then we use the '9' for the second digit: \n                    Original: \"199\"\n                    Replace second digit with '9': but the second digit is already '9', so no improvement. Then we use the '8' for the first digit: \n                        Then we get \"899\", which is less than \"999\".\n\n            So the greedy (using the largest available digit for the current position) is correct.\n\n        However, there is a catch: we cannot use a digit that is equal to the current digit? Actually, if we have a digit equal to the current digit, we can skip it because it doesn't improve. But if we have a digit greater, we must use it? Actually, we want to maximize the number.\n\n        But note: sometimes we might want to save a digit for a later position? Consider:\n\n            a = \"1234\", s = \"33\"\n\n            Possibility 1: \n                Replace the first digit: we don't have a digit greater than '1' (since the available digits are '3' and '3'), so we leave it.\n                Then the second digit: current is '2'. We have two '3's. The largest digit greater than '2' is '3'. We replace the second digit with '3', then we have one '3' left. Then the third digit: current is '3' (from original) and we have a '3' (which is not greater). Then we leave the third and fourth as is. Result: \"1334\".\n\n            Possibility 2: \n                What if we don't replace the second digit and replace the third digit?\n                Then we use the two '3's: replace the third digit (which is '3') with nothing (because 3==3) or if we use one for the third then no improvement. Actually, we can only use the two '3's. But if we use one for the third, then we have one left for the fourth? The fourth digit is '4', so 3<4, so we wouldn't use it. \n\n            But wait: we have two '3's. We can use both. However, if we use one for the second digit, we get \"1334\", which is better than leaving the second digit as '2'. \n\n            The greedy from left to right: \n                Position0: no digit in s is greater than '1' (we have two '3's, but 3>1, so we have two choices. But we don't need to use one here because we are going to use them later. However, the greedy above said: use the largest available digit that is greater than the current. But if we use one at the first digit, then we use a '3' for the first digit, then we have one '3' left. Then the second digit: current is '2', we have a '3' which is greater, so we use it. Then the third digit: current is '3' and we have no digit greater, so we leave it. Then the fourth digit: no digit left. Result: \"3334\".\n\n            Now, which one is better? \"3334\" vs \"1334\": obviously \"3334\" is bigger.\n\n            So the greedy from left to right, even though we have two '3's, we can use one at the first digit and one at the second digit to get a much bigger number.\n\n            Therefore, we should use the largest available digit for the current position if it is greater than the current digit. Even if we can use it later, if we can use it now and make the number bigger, we should.\n\n            However, note: we are not forced to use all the digits. But if we have two '3's and the first digit is '1', then using one '3' at the first digit is beneficial because 3>1. Then we can use the other '3' at the second digit (if the second digit is 2, then 3>2) and so on.\n\n            But wait: what if we have a = \"1234\", s = \"33\", and we use the two '3's at the first digit? Then we get \"3334\", which is the maximum.\n\n            So the greedy is: at each position, if there exists a digit in s (that we haven't used) that is greater than the current digit, then we take the largest one available (so that we maximize the current digit as much as possible). \n\n            Why the largest one? Because we want the current digit to be as high as possible.\n\n        However, there is a potential issue: we might run out of large digits for later positions. But note: we are going from left to right and the leftmost digit is the most significant. We want to maximize the leftmost digit as much as possible. Then the next, etc. \n\n        But consider: \n            a = \"19\", s = \"98\"\n\n            We have two digits: '9' and '8'\n\n            Greedy for first digit: \n                We have two digits greater than '1': '9' and '8'. We take the largest, which is '9'. Then the number becomes \"99\". Then we have an '8' left, but the second digit is now '9' (from replacement) and 8<9, so we don't use it.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n        However, what if we have a = \"19\", s = \"89\"? \n            Same thing: we take '9' for the first digit, then we have an '8' for the second digit (which is 9 -> 8<9, so we don't use). \n\n        But wait: what if we have a = \"19\", s = \"89\", and we take '8' for the first digit? Then we get \"89\", and then we have a '9' for the second digit: but the second digit is '9' (original) and 9==9, so we don't use. Then the result is \"89\", which is less than \"99\". So the greedy (taking the largest available) is better.\n\n        Therefore, the plan:\n\n        Step 1: Read the two strings: a and s.\n\n        Step 2: Count the frequency of each digit in s. We'll use an array `freq` of size 10 (for digits 0 to 9). We can use a list of zeros of length 10.\n\n        Step 3: Traverse the digits of a from left to right (from the first character to the last):\n\n            Let current_digit = int(a[i])\n\n            We want to find the largest digit d (from 9 down to current_digit+1) that is available (freq[d] > 0). \n\n            If we find such a d, then:\n                Replace the current_digit with d.\n                Decrement freq[d] by 1.\n\n            Otherwise, we leave the digit as is.\n\n        Step 4: Output the resulting string.\n\n        But wait: what about the possibility that we might have a digit that is greater than the current_digit, but not the largest? Why use the largest? Because we want the maximum number. Using a larger digit now gives a bigger immediate gain.\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to use the digits arbitrarily (any order, any positions). So the greedy is correct because:\n\n            The goal is to maximize the entire number. The leftmost digit has the highest weight. Therefore, we want to maximize the leftmost digit as much as possible. Then, given the leftmost digit fixed, maximize the next one, and so on.\n\n        But note: sometimes we might have a trade-off: if we use a large digit for a left position, we might not have it for a right position. However, the left position is more important. \n\n        Example: \n            a = \"19\", s = \"98\": \n                If we use '9' for the left, we get \"99\". \n                If we use '8' for the left, we get \"89\", which is less.\n\n            Another example: \n            a = \"199\", s = \"98\": \n                We use '9' for the first digit: \"999\", which is the maximum.\n\n            But consider: \n            a = \"199\", s = \"98\": \n                We have two digits: '9' and '8'. \n                We use the '9' for the first digit, then the second digit: we have an '8' but 8 < 9 (the current digit at the second position is '9') so we don't use.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n        However, there is a caveat: the original digit at the first position is '1'. We have a '9' and an '8' in s. We use the '9' for the first digit. But what if we use the '8' for the first digit and the '9' for the second? \n\n            Then we get: first digit becomes '8', second digit becomes '9' (from the original second digit was '9', so we don't actually change the second digit because we are replacing with a digit that is not greater? Actually, the second digit is originally '9', and we are replacing it with '9' (if we use the '9' for the second digit) which doesn't change the number. \n\n            So the result would be \"899\", which is less than \"999\".\n\n        Therefore, the greedy is safe.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n        We'll create an array `freq` for digits 0 to 9.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            a_str = input().strip()\n            s_str = input().strip()\n\n            # Build frequency array for s_str\n            freq = [0]*10\n            for char in s_str:\n                digit = int(char)\n                freq[digit] += 1\n\n            # Convert a_str to list of characters (or integers) for easier mutation\n            a_list = list(a_str)\n\n            # Traverse each index in a_list\n            for i in range(len(a_list)):\n                # Convert current character to integer\n                current_digit = int(a_list[i])\n                # We want to try to replace with a digit from 9 down to current_digit+1 (i.e., the next digit up to 9)\n                # But note: we might have multiple same digits, so we check from 9 down until we find one that is greater and available.\n                found = False\n                # We are going to try from 9 down to current_digit+1 (inclusive)\n                for d in range(9, current_digit, -1):\n                    if freq[d] > 0:\n                        # Use this digit\n                        a_list[i] = str(d)\n                        freq[d] -= 1\n                        found = True\n                        break\n\n                # If we didn't find a digit greater than current_digit, we leave the digit as is.\n\n            # Then output the string formed by a_list\n            print(''.join(a_list))\n\n        But wait: what if we have a digit that is equal to the current_digit? We skip it. We don't use it because it doesn't help. \n\n        However, what if we have a situation where we can use an equal digit to save a larger digit for a later position? \n\n        Example: \n            a = \"123\", s = \"333\"\n\n            Possibility 1: \n                We want to replace the first digit: we have a '3' (which is greater than '1') so we replace and then we have two '3's left. Then the second digit: we have two '3's, and the current digit is '2' -> we replace with '3', then the third digit: we have one '3' left, and the current digit is '3' -> we don't replace. Result: \"333\".\n\n            Possibility 2: \n                What if we don't use a '3' for the first digit? Then we use two '3's for the second and third digits? \n                First digit remains '1'. Then second digit: replace with '3' -> becomes \"133\", then third digit: replace with '3' -> \"133\" becomes \"133\" (wait, we have three '3's: if we use two for the second and third, then the first digit is still '1'. But then the number is \"133\", which is less than \"333\".\n\n            So it's clear that we should use the largest available digit (greater than current) for the current position.\n\n        However, consider a different scenario:\n\n            a = \"155\", s = \"59\"\n\n            Possibility 1 (greedy): \n                First digit: current_digit=1. We have two digits: 5 and 9. The largest digit greater than 1 is 9. We replace the first digit with 9. Then the rest: \n                    Second digit: current_digit=5. We have 5 left? Actually, we removed 9, so we have one 5 left. Now, 5==5, so we don't replace. Third digit: same, 5==5, so we don't replace. Result: \"955\"\n\n            Possibility 2: \n                What if we don't use the 9 for the first digit? Then we use the 5 for the first digit? But 5>1, so we could. Then we have the 9 left. Then the second digit: current_digit=5, we have 9>5 -> replace the second digit with 9: becomes \"595\". Then the third digit: we have no digit left. \n\n            Now compare: \"955\" vs \"595\": which is bigger? \n                955 > 595.\n\n            So the greedy (using the largest available digit) is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a = \"155\", s = \"59\", and we use the 5 for the first digit? That gives \"555\" (if we use the 5 for the first, then we have 9 left for the second or third). \n            First digit: replace with 5 -> \"555\", then we have 9 left. Then the second digit: 5, we can replace with 9 -> \"595\", then the third digit: 5, we can't replace because 9 is already used? Actually, we have one 9 and one 5 initially. Wait: s=\"59\", so we have one '5' and one '9'. \n\n            Actually, we have two digits: '5' and '9'. \n            Possibility 1 (using the 9 for the first digit): \n                First: 9 -> then we have the 5 left. Then the second digit: 5 (current) and we have 5 (available) -> but 5==5, so we don't replace. Then third: same. Result: \"955\".\n\n            Possibility 2 (using the 5 for the first digit): \n                First: 5 -> then we have the 9 left. Then the second digit: 5, we can replace with 9 -> becomes \"595\". Then the third digit: we have no digit left. \n\n            Possibility 3: use the 5 for the second digit and the 9 for the first? \n                First digit: replace with 9 -> same as Possibility 1.\n\n            Possibility 4: use the 5 for the third digit and the 9 for the first? \n                First: 9 -> then the third digit: we have the 5, which is less than the current third digit (5) -> so we don't use. Result: \"955\".\n\n            Possibility 5: use the 5 for the second digit and leave the first as is? \n                First: 1 -> then we have 9 and 5. Then second digit: replace with 9 -> \"195\", then third digit: replace with 5 (but 5==5, so we don't). Result: \"195\".\n\n            Possibility 6: use the 5 for the second digit and the 9 for the third? \n                First: 1 -> then second: 5 (so the number becomes \"155\" -> wait, we are replacing the second digit with 5? Then the number becomes \"155\" -> but the original is \"155\", so no change. Then third: we have 9, so we can replace the third digit (5) with 9 -> \"159\". \n\n            Now we have three possibilities: \"955\", \"595\", \"195\", \"159\". The maximum is \"955\".\n\n            So the greedy (using the largest available digit for the current position) produces \"955\", which is the maximum.\n\n        Therefore, the code above should work.\n\n        But note: we are iterating from 9 down to current_digit+1. This ensures we pick the largest available digit.\n\n        However, we must note that the same digit might appear multiple times. Our frequency array handles that.\n\n        Let's test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \n                a = \"1024\"\n                s = \"010\"\n\n            Frequency: \n                '0': count=2, '1': count=1\n\n            Process:\n                i=0: current_digit=1. We look for digits from 9 down to 2 (excluding 1). The available digits: 0 and 1. None in the range [2,9] is available. So we leave it as '1'.\n                i=1: current_digit=0. We look for digits from 9 down to 1. We have a '1' available. So we replace with '1'. Then frequency of 1 becomes 0.\n                i=2: current_digit=2. We look for digits from 9 down to 3. Available digits: two '0's. None in [3,9]. So we leave it.\n                i=3: current_digit=4. Similarly, no digit in [5,9] is available.\n\n            Result: \"1124\", which matches the example.\n\n        Example 2:\n            Input: \n                a = \"987\"\n                s = \"1234567\"\n\n            Frequency: \n                We have digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 -> each one time.\n\n            Process:\n                i=0: current_digit=9. We look for digits from 9 down to 10 -> there is no digit above 9. So we leave it as '9'.\n                i=1: current_digit=8. We look for digits from 9 down to 9 (since 8+1=9). We have a '9'? No, because we didn't use it. But wait: our frequency for 9 is 0. So we look for digits from 9 down to 9 (only 9). Not available. Then we look for digits from 8 down to 9? Actually, we start from 9 and go down to 9 (only 9). Then we don't find. So we leave it as '8'. \n                i=2: current_digit=7. We look for digits from 9 down to 8. We have 8 and 9? But we have to check: \n                    From 9 down to 8: \n                        9: not available (freq[9]==0)\n                        8: available? yes, because we have an '8' in s? Actually, wait: s is \"1234567\", so no 8. Then we go down to 7+1=8, so we check from 9 to 8, and 8 is not available. Then we leave it as '7'.\n\n            Result: \"987\", which is correct.\n\n        However, wait: in the example, s is \"1234567\", so we don't have an 8. So the example output is \"987\".\n\n        But note: the example input is given as:\n            Input: \n                ['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n        And the expected outputs are:\n            ['1124', '987']\n\n        So the code works for the examples.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a digit that is not available, but a digit that is equal to the current_digit? We skip it. But we don't use it. \n\n        One more edge: what if the original number is one digit? Then we replace it if we have a digit greater than itself.\n\n        Example: \n            a = \"0\", s = \"1\" -> but note the problem says: the given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. And the printed number shouldn't contain leading zeros. But if a is \"0\", then it's a single digit. However, the problem states that a is given as an integer and its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 10^5. It doesn't say that the integer is positive, but the example input doesn't have leading zeros. \n\n        However, note: the problem says \"The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes.\" and \"The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\"\n\n        But if a is \"0\", then we are not allowed to replace it with a digit that would make it have a leading zero? Actually, if we replace the only digit (which is 0) with a digit from s, then we must not use a digit that is 0? \n\n        But wait: the problem says we are allowed to use not all elements from s. And we are replacing arbitrary positions. \n\n        However, the example input does not include \"0\". The problem says: positive integer a. So a is at least 1-digit and no leading zeros.\n\n        Therefore, we assume the first digit is not zero.\n\n        But what if we have a = \"10\", s = \"0\"? \n            We cannot replace the first digit with 0 because then we get \"00\", which is not allowed (leading zeros). But according to our algorithm, we are allowed to replace any position. However, we must avoid leading zeros.\n\n        In our algorithm, we are replacing from left to right. For the first digit, we are checking for digits greater than the current_digit (which is 1). The available digit is 0, which is less than 1, so we don't replace the first digit. Then the second digit is 0, and we have a 0 in s. We are allowed to replace the second digit with 0? But then we get \"10\" -> same. Or we don't use the 0. \n\n        But wait: the problem says we can use each element at most once. We don't have to use all. \n\n        However, the problem says: the printed number shouldn't contain leading zeros. In the case of a=\"10\", after replacement we get \"10\", which is acceptable.\n\n        But what if we have a=\"10\", s=\"0\", and we try to replace the first digit? We are not going to because 0<1. Then we leave it.\n\n        However, what if we have a=\"0\", but the problem says the given number a doesn't contain leading zeros, so a=\"0\" is given as \"0\", which is allowed? The problem says positive integer a. So a>=1. Therefore, we don't have to worry about a starting with '0'.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"positive integer a\", so a>=1. Then the first digit is at least 1.\n\n        However, note: the example input format: \n            The first line contains positive integer a.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a=\"10\", and s=\"0\", and we replace the second digit with 0? Then we get \"10\", same as before.\n\n        The problem says: we are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n        So the algorithm is:\n\n            Read a and s.\n            Build frequency array for s.\n            For each digit in a (from left to right):\n                current_digit = int(char)\n                For d from 9 down to current_digit+1:\n                    if freq[d] > 0:\n                        replace the current digit with str(d)\n                        freq[d] -= 1\n                        break\n\n            Print the resulting string.\n\n        However, note: we are breaking the inner loop after the first replacement. That is intended.\n\n        But the inner loop goes from 9 down to current_digit+1. We are only replacing once per digit in a.\n\n        Time complexity: O(n * 10) which is acceptable since n<=10^5, but 10^5 * 10 is 1e6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n        But wait: we are iterating from 9 down to current_digit+1. The worst-case current_digit is 0, then we iterate from 9 down to 1 (9 steps). So worst-case 9 * n, which is 900000, acceptable.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: we are reading two lines.\n\n        Code:\n\n            a_str = input().strip()\n            s_str = input().strip()\n\n            # Build frequency array for s_str\n            freq = [0] * 10\n            for char in s_str:\n                digit = int(char)\n                if digit < 10:   # It's a digit, so it's between 0 and 9, so this is safe.\n                    freq[digit] += 1\n\n            # Convert a_str to list of characters\n            a_list = list(a_str)\n\n            # Traverse each character in a_list\n            for i in range(len(a_list)):\n                current_digit = int(a_list[i])\n                # We are going to try from 9 down to current_digit+1 (inclusive)\n                for d in range(9, current_digit, -1):\n                    if freq[d] > 0:\n                        a_list[i] = str(d)\n                        freq[d] -= 1\n                        # Once we replace, we break because we use one digit for one position.\n                        break\n\n            # Output the result\n            print(''.join(a_list))\n\n        Let me test with the examples again.\n\n        Example 1: \n            a_str = \"1024\", s_str = \"010\"\n            freq: \n                freq[0]=2, freq[1]=1, others 0.\n            i=0: current_digit=1 -> d from 9 to 2: no digit available, so no change.\n            i=1: current_digit=0 -> d from 9 to 1: we see d=1 is available -> replace with '1'. Then freq[1] becomes 0.\n            i=2: current_digit=2 -> d from 9 to 3: nothing available (only 0 and 1, but 1 is gone, 0 is less than 3? Actually, we are only checking from 9 down to 3, and 0 and 1 are below 3, so we don't check them). So no change.\n            i=3: current_digit=4 -> d from 9 to 5: nothing. So result: \"1124\" -> correct.\n\n        Example 2:\n            a_str = \"987\", s_str = \"1234567\"\n            freq: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0] (for digits 0 to 9)\n            i=0: current_digit=9 -> d from 9 to 10: but 10 is not in our range (we go from 9 to 10, so we check 9: freq[9]==0 -> no). Then no replacement.\n            i=1: current_digit=8 -> d from 9 to 9: 9 is 0 -> no. Then d from 8 down to 9? Actually, our loop is from 9 down to 8 (exclusive of 8? No: the range is from 9 to 8 (exclusive of 8) meaning we stop at 9? Actually, the range in Python is range(9,8,-1) -> that is [9,8] but note: the range function: range(start, stop, step). \n            Correction: the range is from 9 down to current_digit (which is 8) but the stop condition is when d > current_digit? Actually, the loop condition is for d from 9 down to current_digit+1. But wait,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given number by replacing its digits with digits from a provided sequence, using each digit in the sequence at most once. The key insight is that replacing a digit in a more significant position (leftmost digits) with a larger digit will yield a higher overall number compared to replacing digits in less significant positions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves processing two inputs: the original number and a sequence of digits. The goal is to replace digits in the original number such that the resulting number is as large as possible. Each digit from the sequence can be used at most once.\n2. **Intuition**: The leftmost digits have the highest impact on the number's value. Therefore, we should prioritize replacing the leftmost digits with the largest possible digits from the sequence. This ensures that the most significant digits are maximized first.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a frequency array to keep track of available digits in the sequence. For each digit in the original number, starting from the left, we check if there is a larger digit available in the sequence. If found, we replace the current digit with the largest available larger digit and decrement its count in the frequency array.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each digit of the number once and, for each digit, checks up to 9 possible digits (from 9 down to the current digit + 1). Given that the number can have up to 100,000 digits, the total operations are around 900,000, which is efficient for modern computing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    a_str = input().strip()\n    s_str = input().strip()\n    \n    freq = [0] * 10\n    for char in s_str:\n        digit = int(char)\n        freq[digit] += 1\n            \n    a_list = list(a_str)\n    \n    for i in range(len(a_list)):\n        current_digit = int(a_list[i])\n        for d in range(9, current_digit, -1):\n            if freq[d] > 0:\n                a_list[i] = str(d)\n                freq[d] -= 1\n                break\n                \n    print(''.join(a_list))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the original number (`a_str`) and the sequence of digits (`s_str`).\n2. **Frequency Array Setup**: A frequency array `freq` is initialized to count occurrences of each digit (0-9) in the sequence.\n3. **Processing Digits**: For each digit in the original number (from left to right), the code checks for the largest available digit in the sequence that is greater than the current digit. If found, it replaces the current digit with this larger digit and updates the frequency array.\n4. **Output**: The modified number is printed by joining the processed digits into a string.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number by leveraging a greedy strategy, ensuring the most significant digits are replaced first with the largest available digits, leading to the highest possible value.",
