Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem.\n\n We are given two points (home and university) and n lines (roads). The roads divide the plane into blocks. We can move from one block to another if they share a nonzero length border. This means we can only cross a road (i.e., move from one side to the other) by stepping through an intersection, but note that the movement is defined by crossing entire roads? Actually, the problem says: \"in one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero\". \n\n However, note that two blocks adjacent at an intersection might not have a common border segment of nonzero length if they only meet at the point (like four regions meeting at an intersection). Therefore, we cannot cross multiple roads in one step? Actually, the step is defined as moving from one block to another when they share a border (which is part of a road). So each step must cross exactly one road? But wait: the problem says \"if the length of their common border is nonzero\". That border is part of a road. So if two blocks share a common segment (of positive length) of a road, then they are adjacent and we can move between them.\n\n How do we model the problem?\n\n Observation: The entire plane is divided by n lines. Each line divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university lie in some regions (blocks). The key is to note that each road (line) has two sides. To go from the home block to the university block, we must cross a set of roads (lines). However, the movement is defined in steps: one step crosses one road (because if two blocks share a border, that border is part of one road, so crossing that road moves you from one side to the other).\n\n But note: the problem does not require crossing the road at any particular point. We are allowed to take the shortest path in terms of steps. However, the catch is: we can only move from one block to an adjacent one (sharing a border) in one step. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home block from the university block, but wait: actually, each road that separates the two points must be crossed an odd number of times? Or more precisely, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points (each time we cross a road, we change from one side to the other). However, note: we don't necessarily have to cross a road only once. But we want the minimum number of steps.\n\n Actually, consider: to go from home to university, we must cross every road that separates the two points. And each crossing is one step. But also note: if two roads are parallel, then we can cross one and then the other without being affected by the same road twice? Actually, the condition for a road to be separating the two points is that the two points lie on opposite sides of the road. Then we must cross that road at least once. However, if we cross a road twice, then we are effectively undoing the crossing and we end up on the same side as we started. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the two points (each such road must be crossed exactly once). But wait: is that always true?\n\n Let me think with two roads: \n  Road1: separates home and university.\n  Road2: separates home and university.\n\n Then we must cross both. But if we cross Road1 first, then we are on the opposite side of Road1, and then we cross Road2. Then we are at the university. So that's 2 steps.\n\n Now consider three roads. If all three separate home and university, then 3 steps.\n\n However, what if two roads do not separate the two points? Then we don't need to cross them.\n\n But wait: the problem does not say that we must cross only the separating roads. Actually, we can move arbitrarily in the plane (as long as we stay in blocks). The minimal steps is the minimal number of road crossings required to get from home to university. Since each road crossing is a step, and we can choose the order arbitrarily, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n Why? Because we must cross a road if the two points are on opposite sides. And we cannot avoid crossing a road that separates the two points. Moreover, we don't need to cross a road that does not separate them (because then the two points are on the same side, so we don't need to cross that road to get from one to the other).\n\n However, note: sometimes the two points might be separated by a road, but we might cross the same road twice? But that would be inefficient. So the minimal steps is the number of roads for which the two points lie on opposite sides.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count of roads i for which:\n   sign(a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i) != sign(a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i)\n\n But wait: the input says that the roads are given by aix + biy + ci = 0. We can evaluate the expression for the two points and check the sign.\n\n However, there is a caveat: the expression a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i might be zero for a point? The problem states: \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so we don't have to worry about zeros.\n\n But note: the sign function: we have to define a convention. Let's define:\n   f(x, y) = a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i\n\n Then, for a given road i, if f(x1) and f(x2) have opposite signs (one positive and the other negative), then the road separates the two points.\n\n However, we must be cautious because the sign could be negative or positive, but the product is negative.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Read x1, y1 (home)\n 2. Read x2, y2 (university)\n 3. Read n\n 4. For each of the n roads (each with a_i, b_i, c_i):\n        value1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i\n        value2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i\n\n        If value1 * value2 < 0, then this road separates the two points.\n\n 5. Count the number of such roads.\n\n Then output the count.\n\n But wait: is that really the answer? Let me test with the examples.\n\n Example 1:\n      Input: \n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          2\n          0 1 0   -> This is the road: 0*x + 1*y + 0 = 0, i.e., y=0 (the x-axis)\n          1 0 0   -> This is the road: 1*x + 0*y + 0 = 0, i.e., x=0 (the y-axis)\n\n      Home: (1,1) -> above the x-axis (y>0) and right of the y-axis (x>0).\n      University: (-1,-1) -> below the x-axis (y<0) and left of the y-axis (x<0).\n\n      Road1 (x-axis): \n          f(1,1) = 0*1+1*1+0 = 1 >0\n          f(-1,-1)= 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 <0 -> opposite, so count=1\n\n      Road2 (y-axis):\n          f(1,1)= 1*1+0*1+0 = 1 >0\n          f(-1,-1)= 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 <0 -> opposite, so count=2\n\n      Output: 2 -> matches example.\n\n Example 2:\n      Input:\n          1 1\n          -1 -1\n          3\n          1 0 0   -> x=0\n          0 1 0   -> y=0\n          1 1 -3  -> x+y-3=0\n\n      We already know the first two roads give 2. Now the third road: x+y-3=0.\n\n      For (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0\n      For (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5 <0 -> same side.\n\n      So the third road does not separate the two points. Therefore, the answer is still 2.\n\n However, the example output is 2.\n\n But wait: the example input is given as:\n      ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n And the output is 2.\n\n Therefore, the solution is to count the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says the roads are infinite lines. And the two points are not on any road.\n\n But wait: what if the road is vertical? Our calculation still holds because we are just evaluating the linear equation.\n\n However, there is one more issue: the sign convention. What if the road equation is multiplied by -1? Then the sign of the evaluation changes. But note that the condition is based on the product: if value1 * value2 < 0, then they are on opposite sides. This condition is independent of the sign of the equation. Because if we multiply the entire equation by -1, then both value1 and value2 become negative of the original, so the product remains the same (since (-value1)*(-value2) = value1*value2). Therefore, it is invariant.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   home = (x1, y1)\n   uni = (x2, y2)\n\n   count = 0\n   for each road (a, b, c):\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n However, wait: what if the product is zero? The problem states that the points are not on the road, so d1 and d2 are nonzero. But we are using the product, and if one is zero then the product is zero, but that case won't occur. But wait, the problem says the points are not on the road, so d1 and d2 are never zero. So we are safe.\n\n But wait: what if the product overflows? The numbers can be as large as 10^6 for coefficients and coordinates. The maximum absolute value of d1 and d2 could be:\n\n        |a*x1 + b*y1 + c| <= |a|*|x1| + |b|*|y1| + |c|\n        and since |a|,|b|,|c| <= 10^6 and |x1|,|y1|<=10^6, the maximum absolute value is at most 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 * 10^6 + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6, which is about 2e12. The product then can be as large as (2e12)^2 = 4e24, which is within the range of Python integers (Python integers are arbitrary precision, but we are comparing with 0). However, the problem says the input integers are up to 10^6, so the product might be very large. But note: we are only checking the sign, and the product being negative or positive. However, if the product is too large, we might face performance issues? But 4e24 is a big integer, but Python can handle it, and we have at most 300 roads.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the product by checking the signs separately, but then we have to consider the possibility of zero (but we know they are nonzero). However, the product method is straightforward.\n\n But note: if the product is negative, then one is positive and the other negative. However, if the product is positive, they are on the same side. We don't care about the actual value, just the sign of the product.\n\n However, there is a caveat: if the product is too large and we are concerned about performance (but 300 iterations is small) or even memory, but 4e24 is a fixed size, so it's acceptable.\n\n But wait: what if the two values are both very large and the product overflows in other languages, but in Python we are safe because integers are arbitrary precision. However, the problem constraints say the inputs are integers, so we can use this method.\n\n However, there is an alternative: we can check if (d1 < 0 and d2 > 0) or (d1 > 0 and d2 < 0). This avoids the product and might be faster (though the product is one multiplication, and comparing two signs is two comparisons). But the product is a single operation and then one comparison. The two comparisons might be faster? Actually, in terms of operations, the product is one multiplication and then one comparison. The two comparisons are two condition checks. The multiplication might be more expensive for big integers? But the numbers are integers, and the multiplication is O(1) for fixed-precision, but here the numbers can be up to 2e12, which is still within the range that Python handles as integers (not floats, so no rounding). \n\n However, let's stick to the product because it's concise.\n\n But wait: what if the product is negative zero? In mathematics, negative zero is zero, but in Python, integers don't have negative zero. However, our d1 and d2 are nonzero, so the product is nonzero. And the sign of the product is determined by the signs of d1 and d2.\n\n However, there's a catch: what if the product is too large and we are concerned about the representation? But 2e12 * 2e12 is 4e24, which is an integer that Python can handle without problem (it uses arbitrary precision, so it will take more memory for huge numbers, but 4e24 is about 80 bits, which is still small). \n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b, c = data\n        d1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n        d2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n        if d1 * d2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        home = (1,1), uni = (-1,-1), roads = [ (0,1,0), (1,0,0) ]\n        For (0,1,0): d1 = 0*1+1*1+0 = 1, d2 = 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 -> product = -1 -> count=1\n        For (1,0,0): d1 = 1*1+0*1+0 = 1, d2 = 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0 = -1 -> product=-1 -> count=2 -> output 2.\n\n Example 2: \n        home = (1,1), uni = (-1,-1), roads = [ (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,-3) ]\n        First two: same as above, count becomes 2.\n        Third: (1,1,-3): d1 = 1*1+1*1-3 = 1+1-3 = -1, d2 = 1*(-1)+1*(-1)-3 = -1-1-3=-5 -> product = (-1)*(-5)=5 (positive) -> no increment. So output 2.\n\n But wait, the example input was given as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n And the expected output is 2.\n\n However, the problem statement example output is 2.\n\n But wait, I just noticed the second example in the problem statement is:\n\n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n So it matches.\n\n But wait, the problem statement also has:\n\n        Input: \n            '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0'\n\n        Output: 2\n\n        and \n\n        Input: \n            '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3'\n\n        Output: 2\n\n        However, the example input format in the problem statement is given as two separate strings, but actually the first example is:\n\n            \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0\"\n\n        and the second example is:\n\n            \"1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3\"\n\n        and the outputs are both 2.\n\n Therefore, the code should work.\n\n However, wait: what if the road equation is given in a normalized form? Actually, the problem does not specify normalization, so we have to rely on the fact that the sign of the entire equation is arbitrary. But we already argued that the product is invariant to flipping the sign of the entire equation.\n\n One more test: consider two roads that are the same but with opposite signs? The problem says \"no two roads are the same\", so we don't have duplicate equations. But note: two different equations might represent the same line if one is a multiple of the other? Actually, the problem says \"no two roads are the same\", meaning that the equations are distinct. However, they might be scalar multiples. For example, (1,0,0) and (2,0,0) represent the same line. But the problem says \"each road is defined by the equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0\", and \"no two roads are the same\". So if two equations are scalar multiples, they are considered the same? Actually, the problem says \"the coefficients of the line\", and then \"no two roads are the same\". So we assume that the equations are given in distinct forms (so they are not scalar multiples). However, the problem does not explicitly state that. But note: the input condition is \"It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same\".\n\n So we don't have to worry about duplicate equations.\n\n Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n But wait: what if one of the evaluations is positive and the other negative, but due to overflow we get incorrect sign? The numbers are integers and we are doing integer arithmetic. There's no floating point rounding. So we are safe.\n\n However, let me consider a potential issue: the product of two very large numbers might be negative even if they are both positive? No, because the product of two positive numbers is positive, and two negative numbers is positive, and one positive and one negative is negative.\n\n But wait, the product being negative is exactly the condition we want.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        # Evaluate the two points\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        # Check if the signs are opposite\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me submit this.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the roads are defined by the equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. But note: the sign of the equation can be arbitrary. We are using the product to check opposite signs. This is correct.\n\n But wait: what if the road is defined such that the expression is negative for the home and positive for the university? Then the product is negative. Similarly, positive for home and negative for university also gives negative product.\n\n So it's symmetric.\n\n However, note: the product might be negative zero? In Python, integers don't have negative zero. So we are safe.\n\n But wait: what if the product is negative due to the magnitude being huge? Actually, the sign is determined by the signs of val1 and val2, regardless of magnitude. And the product being negative is equivalent to having opposite signs.\n\n Therefore, we can run this.\n\n But wait: there's an alternative way: we can avoid the product and do:\n\n        if (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0) or (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0):\n\n This is the same condition and avoids the multiplication. It might be more efficient for very large integers? Because multiplication of two large integers can be more expensive than two comparisons. But the numbers are integers and the multiplication is exact. However, the product might be a very big integer (like 4e24) and that might take more memory and time. Whereas the comparisons are done on the original integers (val1 and val2) which are at most 2e12 in absolute value. \n\n But the problem says the inputs are up to 10^6, so the maximum absolute value of a*x+b*y+c is at most 10^6*(10^6) + 10^6*(10^6) + 10^6 = 2e12 + 1e6, which is about 2e12. So the absolute value of val1 and val2 is at most around 2e12, which is acceptable for integer comparisons.\n\n However, the product of two such numbers can be up to 4e24, which is a very big integer and might be slower to compute. \n\n But note: 2e12 * 2e12 = 4e24, which is a number with about 80 bits (base 10: 13 digits, base 2: 80 bits). Python can handle this, but if we are concerned about performance, we can use the sign comparisons.\n\n Let me change to:\n\n        if (val1 < 0) ^ (val2 < 0):\n\n But wait: the XOR (^) operator for booleans: (val1 < 0) is a boolean, and (val2 < 0) is a boolean, then (val1 < 0) ^ (val2 < 0) is True if they are different. However, note: if both are zero, then it would be False, but they are nonzero. Also, if one is positive and the other negative, then one is True and the other False, so XOR is True.\n\n But wait: what if one is negative and the other positive? Then (val1 < 0) is True and (val2 < 0) is False -> True. Similarly, if val1 is positive and val2 is negative: (val1 < 0) is False and (val2 < 0) is True -> True. And if both positive: False XOR False -> False. Both negative: True XOR True -> False.\n\n So this is the same condition.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n\n This is the same.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the minimal steps to be the count of separating roads? Actually, we argued that the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n However, wait: is that always true? Consider that we are allowed to cross roads in any order, and each crossing is a step. But sometimes, we might have to cross a road twice? Actually, no: because if we cross a road an even number of times, we end up on the same side as we started. Since we start on one side and end on the other, we must cross each separating road an odd number of times. The minimal odd number is 1. Therefore, we must cross each separating road at least once, and we can arrange the path so that we cross each separating road exactly once (by choosing the crossings appropriately). Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n So the answer is the count.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        # Using sign comparison: \n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n This is equivalent and avoids the product.\n\n Let me test with the examples again.\n\n Example 1: \n        Road1: (0,1,0): \n            val1 = 1 (positive) -> not <0 -> False\n            val2 = -1 (negative) -> True\n            False != True -> True -> count=1\n\n        Road2: (1,0,0): \n            val1 = 1 -> False\n            val2 = -1 -> True -> True -> count=2\n\n Example 2: \n        Third road: (1,1,-3):\n            val1 = 1+1-3 = -1 -> True (for <0)\n            val2 = -1-1-3 = -5 -> True\n            True != True -> False -> no count.\n\n So it works.\n\n But note: what if the expression is negative for one and positive for the other? The condition (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0) is the same as the product condition.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the condition (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0) is exactly the same as (val1 * val2 < 0) because:\n        If val1 and val2 have opposite signs, then one is positive and the other negative, so the product is negative.\n        If they have the same sign, then the product is positive.\n\n But wait: if one is zero, then the product is zero (and we know they are nonzero). So it's safe.\n\n However, the condition (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0) is slightly more efficient because it doesn't compute the product (which is a multiplication) and instead does two comparisons and an inequality. \n\n But note: the multiplication might be optimized in C, but for integers, the comparison might be cheaper. However, the multiplication of two integers that are 2e12 in absolute value is a costly operation (because it's a big integer multiplication). Comparisons are cheaper.\n\n Therefore, we can use the sign comparison method.\n\n But note: the sign of the expression is defined by the equation. The equation is defined as a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0. The sign of the expression determines the side. \n\n However, there is an edge: what if the road equation is not normalized? For example, if the road equation is multiplied by a negative constant, then the sign of the expression flips. But then the two points would have their signs flipped. However, the condition (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0) is independent of the overall sign because if we flip the equation, then both val1 and val2 become negative (if originally positive) or positive (if originally negative). But then the condition: originally, if they were opposite, after flipping they are still opposite. If they were the same, they remain the same. So it is invariant.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n We'll output the count.\n\n However, wait: the problem statement says the roads divide the plane into connected regions. The minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. But is that really the case?\n\n Let me consider: if we are in a region and we want to get to another region, we must cross the road that separates them. And each road crossing is one step. But note: the problem allows moving from one block to another if they share a common border (of nonzero length). This means that we can only cross one road per step. Therefore, we must cross each separating road exactly once (in the minimal path). Hence, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n However, wait: what if two roads are crossed in a single step? Actually, no: because the common border between two blocks must be a contiguous segment of a single road. Therefore, we cannot cross two roads at once.\n\n Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of separating roads.\n\n But wait: what if the two points are separated by k roads, but these roads are arranged in such a way that we can cross two roads at an intersection? Actually, the movement is defined by moving from one block to an adjacent block (which is separated by one road). Therefore, we must cross each road individually.\n\n Therefore, the answer is the count.\n\n However, there is a known similar problem: the arrangement of lines, and the minimal number of lines to cross to go from one side of the arrangement to the other (from one face to another). The solution is indeed the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\n Therefore, we output the count.\n\n Let me run the provided examples again.\n\n Example 1: 2\n Example 2: 2\n\n But wait, the problem statement example outputs are both 2.\n\n However, I just read the problem statement again: the example input is given as:\n\n        ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n and the expected outputs are ['2','2'].\n\n Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and then the example input. However, the example input is given as two separate strings. But the problem expects one input. Our code reads from stdin.\n\n We assume the input is given in standard input.\n\n Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n Let me submit the code.\n\n However, wait: there is one more thing. What if the road is horizontal or vertical? Our method still works because we are evaluating the expression.\n\n Example: a horizontal road: a=0, b=1, c=0 -> y=0. Then for a point (x,y), the expression is y. So if the point is above (y>0) then positive, below (y<0) negative.\n\n Similarly, vertical road: a=1, b=0, c=0 -> x=0. Then expression is x: positive for x>0, negative for x<0.\n\n So it works.\n\n Code:\n\n   x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n   x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n   n = int(input())\n   count = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            continue\n        a = int(data[0])\n        b = int(data[1])\n        c = int(data[2])\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n            count += 1\n\n   print(count)\n\n Let me run with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            2\n            0 1 0\n            1 0 0\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n        Input:\n            1 1\n            -1 -1\n            3\n            1 0 0\n            0 1 0\n            1 1 -3\n\n        Output: 2\n\n It works.\n\n However, note: the problem says the roads are defined by a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0, and the expression we are evaluating is the same. \n\n But wait: what if the road equation is not normalized and the expression is negative for the entire plane? For example, if the equation is given as -x - y + 1 = 0, then the expression is negative for (0,0): -0-0+1 = 1 (positive). But wait, (0,0) is not on the line, but the sign is positive. \n\n However, the condition is independent of the normalization. We are only checking the relative signs of the two points.\n\n Therefore, we are confident.\n\n Submit.\n\n But wait: the problem statement says \"neither your home nor the university is located on the road\", so we don't have to worry about division by zero or anything.\n\n Final code:\n\n   Read two points, then n, then n lines.\n\n   For each line, compute the expression for the two points.\n\n   Count the lines that separate the two points.\n\n   Print the count.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a single road (line) that separates the two blocks. The key observation is that each road that separates the home and university points must be crossed exactly once in the minimal path.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking how many roads (infinite lines) separate the home point from the university point. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The home and university points lie in specific regions (blocks) defined by these roads. The minimal steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equal to the number of roads that separate the two points.\n2. **Insight**: For each road, evaluate the side of the line on which each point lies. If the two points lie on opposite sides of a road, then that road must be crossed once in the path from home to university.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both points. If the signs of these values differ, the points are on opposite sides of the line, and thus the road separates them. Count all such roads.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each road exactly once, performing constant-time arithmetic operations for each. With \\( n \\) roads (up to 300), the solution efficiently handles the input constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if (val1 < 0) != (val2 < 0):\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the coordinates of the home and university points, followed by the number of roads.\n2. **Processing Each Road**: For each road, defined by coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in the line equation \\(ax + by + c = 0\\), the code evaluates the equation at both points.\n3. **Checking Separation**: The signs of the evaluated expressions for the two points are compared. If they differ, the road separates the points, and the count is incremented.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of separating roads is printed, which represents the minimal steps needed to reach the university from home, as each step crosses one such road.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages geometric properties and simple arithmetic to solve the problem within the given constraints.",
