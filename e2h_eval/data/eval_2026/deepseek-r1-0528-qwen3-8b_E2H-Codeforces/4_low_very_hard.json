The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

So the loss is for Scissors.\n   Scissors beats Paper -> (Scissors, Paper): Scissors wins, so Paper loses.\n   Paper beats Rock -> (Paper, Rock): Paper wins, so Rock loses.\n\n So, we can define the outcome for a pair (x, y):\n   if x == y -> draw\n   else:\n        if (x, y) is (R, S), (S, P), (P, R) then x wins, so y loses? Actually, wait:\n\n        Actually, let's map the outcomes:\n\n        We have:\n          R beats S -> so if Nikephoros plays R and Polycarpus plays S, then Nikephoros wins and Polycarpus loses.\n          S beats P -> so if Nikephoros plays S and Polycarpus plays P, then Nikephoros wins and Polycarpus loses.\n          P beats R -> so if Nikephoros plays P and Polycarpus plays R, then Nikephoros wins and Polycarpus loses.\n\n        Conversely, if the roles are reversed, then the opposite happens.\n\n        Alternatively, we can say:\n          For a given (x, y):\n            if (x, y) is (R, S): then x wins -> so Polycarpus loses (because y=S)\n            if (x, y) is (S, P): then x wins -> Polycarpus loses\n            if (x, y) is (P, R): then x wins -> Polycarpus loses\n\n            Similarly, if (x, y) is (S, R): then y wins (because R beats S) -> so Nikephoros loses.\n            if (x, y) is (P, S): then y wins (because S beats P) -> so Nikephoros loses.\n            if (x, y) is (R, P): then y wins (because P beats R) -> so Nikephoros loses.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think of the outcome as:\n          Let outcome(x, y) = \n            if (x, y) is (R, S): +1 for Nikephoros (so loss for Polycarpus)\n            if (x, y) is (S, P): +1 for Nikephoros (so loss for Polycarpus)\n            if (x, y) is (P, R): +1 for Nikephoros (so loss for Polycarpus)\n            if (x, y) is (S, R): -1 for Nikephoros (so loss for Nikephoros)\n            if (x, y) is (P, S): -1 for Nikephoros (so loss for Nikephoros)\n            if (x, y) is (R, P): -1 for Nikephoros (so loss for Nikephoros)\n\n        But note: we don't need the score for both, we just need to count the losses.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute for every possible pair (x, y) whether it's a loss for Nikephoros or for Polycarpus.\n\n        We can define:\n          loss_nike(x, y) = True if (x, y) is (R, S), (S, P), (P, R) -> wait, no: actually, if x is R and y is S, then x wins -> so this is not a loss for Nikephoros, but a win.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) for both players in a series of rock-paper-scissors games played over `n` rounds. The players use cyclic sequences of moves, and the challenge is to efficiently compute the results without simulating each round individually due to the large possible value of `n` (up to 2·10^9).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use cyclic sequences of moves (rock, paper, scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current moves of both players. The key observation is that the sequences repeat every `m` and `k` rounds respectively, where `m` and `k` are the lengths of the sequences. \n\n2. **Key Insight**: The problem can be broken down by analyzing one full cycle of both sequences (i.e., `lcm(m, k)` rounds). Within this cycle, we can count the number of losses for each player. Since `n` can be very large, we calculate the number of full cycles and then handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: Instead of processing each round one by one, we:\n   - Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths to find the cycle length.\n   - Precompute the outcomes for all pairs of moves (from both sequences) to quickly determine wins/losses.\n   - For each position within the cycle, count the losses for both players.\n   - Multiply these counts by the number of full cycles and add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    total_rounds = n\n    \n    cycle_length = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    full_cycles = total_rounds // cycle_length\n    remainder_rounds = total_rounds % cycle_length\n    \n    def outcome(x, y):\n        if x == y:\n            return 0, 0\n        if (x == 'R' and y == 'S') or (x == 'S' and y == 'P') or (x == 'P' and y == 'R'):\n            return 0, 1\n        else:\n            return 1, 0\n            \n    loss_nike_total = 0\n    loss_poly_total = 0\n    \n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n        idx_a = (i // k) % m\n        idx_b = (i % k) + (i // k) * k\n        x = A[idx_a]\n        y = B[idx_b % k]\n        loss_nike, loss_poly = outcome(x, y)\n        loss_nike_total += loss_nike\n        loss_poly_total += loss_poly\n        \n    loss_nike_total *= full_cycles\n    loss_poly_total *= full_cycles\n    \n    for i in range(remainder_rounds):\n        idx_a = (i * k // cycle_length) % m\n        idx_b = (i * k) % k\n        x = A[idx_a]\n        y = B[idx_b]\n        loss_nike, loss_poly = outcome(x, y)\n        loss_nike_total += loss_nike\n        loss_poly_total += loss_poly\n        \n    print(loss_nike_total, loss_poly_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The cycle length is computed as the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths `m` and `k`. This helps in determining the pattern of moves that repeats.\n3. **Outcome Determination**: The `outcome` function checks the result of each round based on the current moves of both players. It returns `(0, 1)` if Polycarpus loses, `(1, 0)` if Nikephoros loses, and `(0, 0)` for a draw.\n4. **Full Cycles Processing**: The number of full cycles is calculated, and the losses for each player in one full cycle are multiplied by this number to get the total losses from full cycles.\n5. **Remaining Rounds**: The remaining rounds after processing full cycles are handled separately to account for any partial cycles.\n6. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging cyclic patterns and mathematical operations to avoid brute-force simulation.",
