Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, and then n lines of n characters each.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n 1. All the letters on both diagonals must be the same (but note: the center is part of both diagonals, so we can consider the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal).\n 2. All the other squares (not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, and that letter must be different from the one on the diagonals.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\", meaning that the entire main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) must have the same letter, and the entire anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must have the same letter. But note: the center is common to both diagonals. So the entire cross must be the same letter, say 'x', and the rest must be the same letter, say 'o'.\n\n But wait: the example input:\n   Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw -> Output: YES\n\n Let's break down the example:\n   w s w\n   s w s\n   w s w\n\n The main diagonal: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][2]='w' -> all 'w'\n The anti-diagonal: [0][2]='w', [1][1]='w', [2][0]='w' -> all 'w'\n\n Then the rest: \n   [0][1] = 's', [1][0] = 's', [1][2] = 's', [2][1] = 's' -> all 's'\n\n And note: the two conditions: \n   Condition 1: both diagonals are the same letter (here 'w').\n   Condition 2: the non-diagonal parts are the same letter (here 's') and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n However, note that the center is included in both diagonals, but we are told that the entire diagonal must be the same. So we can extract:\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read n and the grid.\n 2. Extract the main diagonal: for i in range(n): grid[i][i]\n 3. Extract the anti-diagonal: for i in range(n): grid[i][n-1-i]\n\n 4. Check that all characters in the main diagonal are the same and all characters in the anti-diagonal are the same.\n    But note: the two diagonals might have different letters? According to the problem, they must be the same? Actually, the problem states:\n        \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n    This means that the entire main diagonal has one letter (say 'a'), and the entire anti-diagonal has one letter (say 'b'). But wait, the condition does not say they must be the same as each other? \n\n    However, the example output for the second example is 'YES', but in the example the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are both 'w'. \n\n    Let me reread: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". It doesn't explicitly say that the two diagonals have the same letter. But then what about the rest? The rest must be the same and different from the diagonals. But if the two diagonals have different letters, then the rest must be two different letters? Actually no: the rest must be a single letter that is different from the diagonals. But wait, the diagonals have two different letters? Then the rest must be the same and also different from both? That is impossible because the rest must be the same letter and different from the diagonals, but if the diagonals have two different letters then we have two different letters that the rest must avoid? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n    So the non-diagonal part is one letter, and that letter must be different from the letter on the diagonals. But note: the diagonals have two sets: the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal. The condition for the diagonals is that the entire main diagonal is the same and the entire anti-diagonal is the same. There is no requirement that the two diagonals have the same letter.\n\n    However, look at the example: \n        Example 1: \n          5\n          xooox\n          oxoxo\n          soxoo\n          oxoxo\n          xooox -> NO\n\n        Why? Because the main diagonal is: ['x','o','x','o','x'] -> not all the same.\n\n        Example 2: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw -> YES\n\n        Example 3:\n          3\n          xpx\n          pxp\n          xpe -> NO\n\n    In example 3, the diagonals:\n        Main diagonal: ['x','p','e'] -> not all same? Actually, the main diagonal: \n            first row: 'x' (at [0][0]), second row: 'p' (at [1][1]), third row: 'e' (at [2][2]) -> not the same.\n\n    But wait, example 3 is given as NO. So the condition for the diagonals is that the entire main diagonal is the same and the entire anti-diagonal is the same.\n\n    However, in example 2, the main diagonal is all 'w' and the anti-diagonal is all 'w'. So same letter for both diagonals.\n\n    But what if the two diagonals have different letters? For example, consider:\n\n        n=3\n        aaa\n        aba\n        aaa\n\n    Here, main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not all same -> fails.\n\n    Another example with different letters in the two diagonals:\n\n        n=3\n        aba\n        bab\n        aba\n\n    Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not same -> fails.\n\n    How about:\n\n        n=3\n        aaa\n        bbb\n        aaa\n\n    Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not same.\n\n    Now, let's try:\n\n        n=3\n        aaa\n        abb\n        aac\n\n    Main diagonal: ['a','b','c'] -> not same.\n\n    But what if the two diagonals have different letters? Example:\n\n        n=3\n        aba\n        bcb\n        abd\n\n    Main diagonal: ['a','c','d'] -> not same.\n\n    So the condition for the diagonals is that the main diagonal must be composed of the same letter, and the anti-diagonal must be composed of the same letter (which can be different from the main diagonal's letter). \n\n    However, the problem statement says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". It doesn't require the two diagonals to be the same letter. \n\n    But then, consider the non-diagonal part: they must be the same letter and different from the diagonals. But note: the non-diagonal part must be one letter, say 'x'. However, the diagonals have two letters: let's say the main diagonal is 'a' and the anti-diagonal is 'b'. Then the non-diagonal part must be the same letter and different from the diagonals. But the diagonals have two different letters, so the non-diagonal part must be a letter that is not 'a' and not 'b'. \n\n    However, the example outputs only when the two diagonals are the same letter? Actually, no, the examples don't cover this. Let me check the problem statement again: it doesn't say the two diagonals must be the same letter, but it says \"on both diagonals\" (each diagonal independently) the letters are the same.\n\n    Now, the non-diagonal part must be the same letter and that letter must be different from the letters on the diagonals. But if the two diagonals have different letters, then the non-diagonal part must be a letter that is not the main diagonal's letter and not the anti-diagonal's letter.\n\n    Example: \n        n=3\n        aaa\n        aba\n        aaa   -> This fails because main diagonal is not all same.\n\n    Let me make a valid example with two different diagonals:\n\n        n=3\n        xxx\n        xyy\n        xxx\n\n    Main diagonal: ['x','y','x'] -> not same.\n\n    Another try:\n\n        n=3\n        xxx\n        xyy\n        yxx   -> main diagonal: ['x','y','x'] -> not same.\n\n    Actually, the main diagonal must be all the same. So the example must have the same letter on the main diagonal. Similarly, the anti-diagonal must be the same, but the two diagonals can be two different letters.\n\n    Example:\n\n        n=3\n        aba\n        bcb\n        aba\n\n    Main diagonal: ['a','c','a'] -> not same.\n\n    How about:\n\n        n=3\n        aaa\n        bbb\n        aaa   -> main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not same.\n\n    We need the main diagonal to be same, so let me set the main diagonal to be 'a' and the anti-diagonal to be 'b':\n\n        n=3\n        a b a\n        b c b\n        a b a\n\n    Then main diagonal: ['a','c','a'] -> not same.\n\n    To have the main diagonal same, set the main diagonal to be 'a':\n\n        n=3\n        a b a\n        b a b\n        a b a\n\n    Then main diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> same.\n    Anti-diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> same.\n\n    So now, the two diagonals are both 'a'. Then the non-diagonal part: \n        [0][1] = 'b', [1][0] = 'b', [1][2] = 'b', [2][1] = 'b' -> all 'b'. \n        Condition: non-diagonal part is the same and different from the diagonal (which is 'a') -> 'b' != 'a'. \n\n    So this should be \"YES\".\n\n    Now, what if I set the anti-diagonal to a different letter?\n\n        n=3\n        a b a\n        b b b\n        a b a\n\n    Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not same.\n\n    How about:\n\n        n=3\n        a b a\n        b c b\n        a b a   -> main diagonal: ['a','c','a'] -> not same.\n\n    Let me try with:\n\n        n=3\n        a b a\n        b c d\n        d c b   -> main diagonal: ['a','c','b'] -> not same.\n\n    It seems very hard to have two different letters for the two diagonals and satisfy the condition that the main diagonal is all same and the anti-diagonal is all same (each independently) and then the non-diagonals are the same and different from both.\n\n    Actually, the two diagonals must be two letters, say d1 for the main and d2 for the anti. Then the non-diagonal part must be a letter d3 such that d3 != d1 and d3 != d2.\n\n    But note: the two diagonals share the center. So the center must be both d1 and d2. Therefore, d1 must equal d2.\n\n    Why? Because the center is included in both diagonals. So the center must be the same letter for both diagonals. Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\n    So the condition is: the entire main diagonal is a single letter, say 'x'; the entire anti-diagonal is the same letter, and by the center being common, that letter must be 'x' (same as the main diagonal). Then the non-diagonal part must be a letter, say 'o', which is different from 'x'.\n\n    Therefore, the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n\n    Correction: The problem does not explicitly say the two diagonals must be the same letter, but the center is common. So the center must be the same for both diagonals. Hence, the entire main diagonal is one letter and the entire anti-diagonal is that same letter (because the center is fixed).\n\n    So steps:\n\n    Let d = the letter for the diagonals (must be the same for both diagonals).\n\n    Then, for every cell (i, j):\n        If (i == j) or (i+j == n-1), then the letter must be d.\n        Otherwise, the letter must be the same (say e) and e != d.\n\n    Algorithm:\n\n    1. Read n.\n    2. Read grid (list of strings)\n\n    3. Traverse the grid to collect:\n        - All the letters that are on the main diagonal (i==j) and anti-diagonal (i+j == n-1). But note: the center is repeated. We can set a variable `diag_letter` to the letter at (0,0) and then check the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal.\n\n    4. However, we can do:\n\n        Let d = grid[0][0]   (but wait, what if the main diagonal starts with a different letter? We must check the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal to determine the letter.)\n\n        Actually, we can:\n\n        Step 1: Check the main diagonal and anti-diagonal for consistency.\n\n        Let diag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\n        Let diag2 = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n)]\n\n        Then, the entire main diagonal must be the same letter. Similarly for anti-diagonal.\n\n        So:\n        if len(set(diag1)) != 1 or len(set(diag2)) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        But wait: we also have the constraint that the two diagonals must be the same letter because of the center? Actually, the center is the same element. The center is at index (n//2, n//2). Then:\n\n        diag1_center = diag1[n//2]\n        diag2_center = diag2[n//2]\n\n        Since both sets are of size 1, then diag1 is [d1] and diag2 is [d2]. But d1 must equal d2 because the center is the same element: grid[n//2][n//2] is in both diag1 and diag2.\n\n        So actually, we don't need to check separately that the two diagonals are the same, because the center forces it. However, if we check the entire main diagonal and anti-diagonal, then the center is included in both, so the entire diag1 must be d1 and diag2 must be d2, and the center must be d1 and d2, hence d1 must equal d2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set d = the letter of the main diagonal (which is the same for all) and then check the anti-diagonal: it must be the same d.\n\n        But note: what if the main diagonal has a letter, and the anti-diagonal has a different letter? Then the center would have to be two letters at once, which is impossible.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n        d = diag1[0]   # because the main diagonal is all same, so any element is d.\n\n        Then, check that the anti-diagonal is all d.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check that the entire main diagonal is the same and the entire anti-diagonal is the same, and then check that the center is the same for both. But since the center is in both, if the main diagonal is same and anti-diagonal is same, then the center must be the same for both.\n\n        Actually, the condition for the anti-diagonal being same doesn't guarantee that the letter is the same as the main diagonal. However, the center is shared, so the center of the anti-diagonal must equal the center of the main diagonal. Therefore, the entire anti-diagonal must be the same as the main diagonal's letter.\n\n        But wait, if the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b', then the center is 'a' (from main) and the center is also 'b' (from anti) -> contradiction. So the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n\n        Therefore, we can:\n\n        Step 1: Check that the main diagonal is composed of the same letter, say d.\n        Step 2: Check that the anti-diagonal is composed of the same letter, and that letter must be d.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check:\n\n        Step 1: Check that the entire main diagonal is the same (if not, \"NO\")\n        Step 2: Check that the entire anti-diagonal is the same (if not, \"NO\")\n        Step 3: Check that the main diagonal's letter is the same as the anti-diagonal's letter (if not, \"NO\")\n\n        But note: the center is the same for both, so if the main diagonal is same and anti-diagonal is same, then the center is the same for both, so the entire anti-diagonal must be the same as the main diagonal? Not necessarily: the anti-diagonal could be all 'b' and the main diagonal all 'a', but the center is included in both, so the center must be both 'a' and 'b', which is impossible unless a==b.\n\n        So we can simply check:\n\n        diag1 = set(grid[i][i] for i in range(n))\n        diag2 = set(grid[i][n-1-i] for i in range(n))\n\n        if len(diag1) != 1 or len(diag2) != 1 or next(iter(diag1)) != next(iter(diag2)):\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n\n        But wait, the set operation for diag1 and diag2: if the main diagonal has one letter, then diag1 has one element. Similarly for diag2. Then we compare the two letters.\n\n        Alternatively, we can:\n\n        d1 = grid[0][0]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d1:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        d2 = grid[0][n-1]   # but wait, the anti-diagonal starts at [0][n-1] and goes to [n-1][0]. However, the entire anti-diagonal must be the same, so we can use any element.\n\n        But note: the center is the last element of the main diagonal, which is [n-1][n-1] but also the first element of the anti-diagonal is [0][n-1] and the center is [n//2][n//2]. We cannot assume that the entire anti-diagonal is the same as the main diagonal until we check.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        d = grid[0][0]   # from the main diagonal start\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n        # Now check anti-diagonal: we know the center must be d, so the anti-diagonal must have the same d throughout?\n        # But wait, we just established that the two diagonals must be the same letter because of the center. So the anti-diagonal must be d.\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n        Then, we check the non-diagonal part.\n\n        For each cell (i, j) that is not on the diagonals (i.e., i != j and i+j != n-1), we must have the same letter, say e, and e != d.\n\n        However, note: the non-diagonal part must be the same letter. So we can:\n\n        e = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue   # skip the diagonals\n                if e is None:\n                    e = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != e:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        return\n\n        And then check that e != d.\n\n        But wait, what if the non-diagonal part is empty? For n=1, but n>=3. So there will be non-diagonal cells.\n\n        However, there is a catch: what if the entire grid is the same letter? Then the non-diagonal part is the same as the diagonal part? Then we would have e == d, which violates the condition.\n\n        Example: \n            n=3, grid:\n            aaa\n            aaa\n            aaa\n\n        Then the diagonals are all 'a'. Then the non-diagonal part is also 'a'. Condition requires non-diagonal part to be same and different from diagonal -> fails.\n\n        So we must check that the non-diagonal part is the same and that letter is different from d.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\". So if the non-diagonal part is the same, and that same letter is different from d, then it's okay.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Read n and grid.\n        2. Check the main diagonal: all same letter, call it d1.\n        3. Check the anti-diagonal: all same letter, call it d2.\n        4. But note: the center is common, so d1 must equal d2. Actually, we can check the entire anti-diagonal with the main diagonal's letter.\n\n        Alternatively, we can combine:\n\n        Let d = grid[0][0]\n        # Check main diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        # Check anti-diagonal: we know the center must be d, but we must check the entire anti-diagonal is d.\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n\n        # Now, check non-diagonal part: all the same and different from d.\n        base_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if base_letter is None:\n                    base_letter = grid[i][j]\n                elif grid[i][j] != base_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n\n        if base_letter is None:\n            # This means there's no non-diagonal cell, but n>=3 so there is always at least one non-diagonal cell? Actually, for n=3, the center is the only diagonal, and the others are non-diagonal. But wait, for n=3, the non-diagonal part has 5 cells. But what if n=1? The problem says n>=3. So we are safe.\n            print(\"NO\")   # Actually, this case should not happen because n>=3, but we can avoid by ensuring we have at least one non-diagonal cell.\n        else:\n            if base_letter == d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n        However, wait: what if the non-diagonal part is empty? Actually, for n=3, the total cells are 9, and the diagonals (main and anti) have 3+3-1=5 cells (because center is counted twice). So 9-5=4 non-diagonal cells. So base_letter will be set.\n\n        But what if the grid is 3x3 and we have:\n\n            aaa\n            aaa\n            aaa\n\n        Then the main diagonal is 'a', anti-diagonal is 'a', and then the non-diagonal part: we set base_letter to 'a' (from the first non-diagonal cell, say [0][1]). Then we check all non-diagonal cells: they are 'a'. Then we check base_letter == d -> 'a'=='a' -> True, then we print \"NO\".\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, consider a grid where the non-diagonal part has two different letters? Then we break in the middle and output \"NO\".\n\n        But wait: we set base_letter from the first non-diagonal cell and then check the rest. If we find a different one, we break.\n\n        Example:\n\n            a b a\n            b c b\n            a b a\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','c','a'] -> fails because not same. So we never get to the non-diagonal part.\n\n        Another example that passes:\n\n            a b a\n            b a b\n            a b a\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> ok, so d='a'\n        Anti-diagonal: [grid[0][2]='a', grid[1][1]='a', grid[2][0]='a'] -> ok.\n\n        Then non-diagonal part: \n            [0][1] = 'b', then base_letter='b'\n            [1][0] = 'b' -> matches\n            [1][2] = 'b' -> matches\n            [2][1] = 'b' -> matches\n\n        Then check base_letter != d -> 'b' != 'a' -> True, so output \"YES\".\n\n        One more example:\n\n            xooox\n            oxoxo\n            soxoo\n            oxoxo\n            xooox\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            row0: 'x'\n            row1: 'o'\n            row2: 's' -> already fails. So we output \"NO\".\n\n        Example 3: \n            3\n            xpx\n            pxp\n            xpe\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            row0: 'x'\n            row1: 'p'\n            row2: 'e' -> not same -> \"NO\"\n\n        So the code:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            grid.append(input().strip())\n\n        # Check main diagonal\n        d = grid[0][0]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check non-diagonal part\n        base_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if base_letter is None:\n                    base_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != base_letter:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n        # Now, base_letter must exist because n>=3 and there is at least one non-diagonal cell.\n        if base_letter is None:\n            # This would mean there are no non-diagonal cells, which only happens when n==0 or n==1, but n>=3, so normally we don't get here.\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        if base_letter == d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n    However, wait: what if the entire grid is the diagonal letter? Then the non-diagonal part would be the same as d, and we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n    But what if the non-diagonal part is not present? Actually, for n>=3, there are always non-diagonal cells.\n\n    But wait, what if the grid is 3x3: the main diagonal has 3 cells, anti-diagonal has 3 cells, but the center is repeated so total diagonal cells is 5. So 9-5=4 non-diagonal cells.\n\n    However, there is a possibility: what if the grid is 3x3 and we have:\n\n        aaa\n        aab\n        aba\n\n    Then the main diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> ok, d='a'\n    Anti-diagonal: [grid[0][2]='a', grid[1][1]='a', grid[2][0]='a'] -> ok.\n\n    Then non-diagonal: \n        [0][1] = 'a' -> base_letter='a'\n        Then we check the rest: [1][0]='a', [1][2]='b', [2][1]='b'\n\n        At [1][2]: 'b' != 'a' -> fails.\n\n    So the above grid is correctly rejected.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the entire non-diagonal part must be the same letter. So we must check that all non-diagonal cells are the same.\n\n    The above code does that.\n\n    But wait, what if the non-diagonal part is not contiguous? We are checking every cell that is not on the diagonals.\n\n    This is acceptable.\n\n    However, there is a potential performance issue: the grid can be up to 299x299 (n<300). The non-diagonal part has about (n*n - 2*n + 1) cells. Since n<300, the maximum is around 89900, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n    But we can optimize the non-diagonal part: we don't need to iterate over the entire grid if we break early. The code above breaks early if a non-diagonal cell is different.\n\n    However, we are setting base_letter only once and then comparing the rest. This is efficient.\n\n    Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n    Example 1: \n        Input: \n            5\n            xooox\n            oxoxo\n            soxoo\n            oxoxo\n            xooox\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            row0: 'x'\n            row1: 'o' -> not 'x' -> prints \"NO\"\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input:\n            3\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            row0: 'w'\n            row1: 'w'\n            row2: 'w' -> ok, d='w'\n        Anti-diagonal:\n            row0: grid[0][2] = 'w'\n            row1: grid[1][1] = 'w'\n            row2: grid[2][0] = 'w' -> ok.\n\n        Non-diagonal part:\n            [0][1] = 's' -> base_letter='s'\n            [1][0] = 's' -> ok\n            [1][2] = 's' -> ok\n            [2][1] = 's' -> ok\n\n        Then base_letter ('s') != 'w' -> YES.\n\n    Example 3:\n        Input:\n            3\n            xpx\n            pxp\n            xpe\n\n        Main diagonal: \n            row0: 'x'\n            row1: 'p' -> not 'x' -> NO.\n\n    So the outputs: ['NO','YES','NO'] as expected.\n\n    However, wait: the example 2 was given as YES, and our code returns YES.\n\n    But note: the example 3: \n        Input: \n            3\n            xpx\n            pxp\n            xpe\n\n        Our code checks the main diagonal: \n            row0: 'x'\n            row1: 'p' -> fails, so we output \"NO\".\n\n    But wait, the example 3 is the third example and expected output is \"NO\", which matches.\n\n    However, the example input was provided as:\n\n        ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n    So we are good.\n\n    But wait, there is a nuance: what if the main diagonal is same and the anti-diagonal is same, but the anti-diagonal is a different letter? \n\n    Example:\n\n        n=3\n        aaa\n        bbb\n        aaa\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not same, so we output \"NO\".\n\n    Another example:\n\n        n=3\n        aba\n        bab\n        aba\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not same.\n\n    How about:\n\n        n=3\n        abc\n        def\n        ghi\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','e','i'] -> not same.\n\n    Now, what if:\n\n        n=3\n        a b c\n        d e f\n        g h i\n\n        We require main diagonal same: a,e,i must be same -> not, so NO.\n\n    But what if:\n\n        n=3\n        a a a\n        a b a\n        a a a\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','b','a'] -> not same.\n\n    How about:\n\n        n=3\n        a a a\n        a a a\n        a a a\n\n        Main diagonal: ['a','a','a'] -> same.\n        Anti-diagonal: [grid[0][2]='a', grid[1][1]='a', grid[2][0]='a'] -> same.\n\n        Then non-diagonal part: \n            [0][1] = 'a' -> base_letter='a'\n            Then we check the rest: [1][0]='a', [1][2]='a', [2][1]='a' -> all 'a'\n\n        Then base_letter=='a' and d=='a' -> same, so output \"NO\".\n\n    This is correct.\n\n    But wait, the problem says the non-diagonal part must be the same and different from the diagonal. In this case, the non-diagonal part is the same as the diagonal, so it fails.\n\n    One more example with two different diagonals? But we already proved the two diagonals must be the same because of the center. So no.\n\n    Code:\n\n    We assume the grid is read correctly.\n\n    Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n    However, note: the problem says n is odd and at least 3.\n\n    Final code:\n\n    Note: We must not use exit(0) in the middle? Or we can use return if we are in a function. But the problem doesn't specify function. Let me use:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Check main diagonal\n        d = grid[0][0]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check non-diagonal part\n        base_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if base_letter is None:\n                    base_letter = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != base_letter:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        exit(0)\n\n        if base_letter is None:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if base_letter == d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n    But wait, the problem says the grid has n lines, each of n letters. We are reading correctly.\n\n    However, we can avoid multiple exits by using a function.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Check main diagonal\n        d = grid[0][0]\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check anti-diagonal\n        for i in range(n):\n            if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\n        # Check non-diagonal part\n        base_letter = None\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                    continue\n                if base_letter is None:\n                    base_letter = grid[i][j]\n                elif grid[i][j] != base_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit(0)\n\n        # Now, if we haven't exited, then base_letter is set (unless n==1, but n>=3) and we check.\n        if base_letter == d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n    But wait, what if the grid has no non-diagonal cells? For n>=3, the minimum non-diagonal cells is 4 (for n=3). So base_letter is set.\n\n    However, if n==1, then the main diagonal is [0][0] and the anti-diagonal is [0][0] (since 0+0==0, and n-1-0=0). Then the non-diagonal part: for i in range(1) and j in range(1): no loop. So base_letter remains None.\n\n    But the problem says n>=3, so we don't have to worry.\n\n    But let me adjust: if n==1, then the entire grid is one cell. Then the condition for diagonals: the main diagonal is [grid[0][0]] and the anti-diagonal is [grid[0][0]]. Then the non-diagonal part is empty. Then base_letter is None. Then we check: base_letter is None -> then we print \"NO\"? But the problem says n>=3, so we ignore.\n\n    We can run the code for n=3,5,... up to 299.\n\n    Let me test with n=3 and the example that should be YES and NO.\n\n    Example 2: \n        Input: \n            3\n            wsw\n            sws\n            wsw\n\n        Output: YES.\n\n    Example 3: \n        Input: \n            3\n            xpx\n            pxp\n            xpe\n\n        Output: NO.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Main Diagonal**: The main diagonal consists of cells where the row index equals the column index (i.e., `grid[i][i]` for each `i`). All these cells must contain the same letter, say `d`.\n2. **Check Anti-Diagonal**: The anti-diagonal consists of cells where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1` (i.e., `grid[i][n-1-i]` for each `i`). All these cells must also contain the same letter `d`. Note that the center cell is common to both diagonals, so the letter `d` must be consistent across both diagonals.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: All cells not on either diagonal must contain the same letter, say `e`, which is different from `d`. \n\nIf all these conditions are met, the grid forms an \"X\"; otherwise, it does not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    d = grid[0][0]\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n            \n    base_letter = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if base_letter is None:\n                base_letter = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != base_letter:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    return\n                    \n    if base_letter is None:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if base_letter == d:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and the grid itself as a list of strings.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check**: The code checks if all elements on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are the same letter `d`. If any element differs, it immediately prints \"NO\" and exits.\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, the code checks if all elements on the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same letter `d`. Again, if any element differs, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Check**: The code then checks all other cells (not on either diagonal) to ensure they contain the same letter `e`, which must differ from `d`. If any cell contains a different letter, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n5. **Final Decision**: If all checks pass, the code verifies that the non-diagonal letter `e` is different from `d` and prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies all conditions required to determine if the grid forms an \"X\" by leveraging systematic checks and early termination upon encountering any invalid condition.",
