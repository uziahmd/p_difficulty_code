His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x in the first line, then two lists of n integers: a (first tour) and b (second tour).\n\n We know that Vasya has at least x points in total. But note: the problem says the results have no names. However, we know that there exists two indices i, j (possibly same, but note: the participant's two tours are fixed for them) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify that the same index must be used for Vasya? Actually, wait: the input gives two lists of n integers each. The Olympiad has n participants, each with one score in the first tour and one in the second.\n\n However, we are told that Vasya was present. There is exactly two numbers (one from the first list and one from the second) that belong to Vasya, but we don't know which ones. But note: the problem says \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" and \"It is guaranteed that Vasya was present\".\n\n Actually, the problem states: \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x\". But note: it doesn't say that the same participant's two scores are given by a_i and b_j. However, the problem also says: \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", meaning that each participant has one score in the first and one in the second.\n\n But note: the input provides two lists of n integers. So we can think of the data as two arrays: \n   First array: [a1, a2, ..., an] for the first tour.\n   Second array: [b1, b2, ..., bn] for the second tour.\n\n And we don't know which a_i and which b_j belong to the same participant (except that Vasya has one a and one b, and his total is at least x).\n\n However, the catch: the entire set of participants is these n people. Each participant is defined by one element from a and one from b, but the pairing is unknown. The total results table sorts by the sum (a_i + b_j) for the same participant.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the participants' points are given in the arbitrary order\". So the two lists are independent.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are to find the best and worst place Vasya could have.\n\n 2. How to model?\n    Let Vasya's two scores be (a_i, b_j). Then his total is s = a_i + b_j, which must be at least x.\n\n 3. The ranking is by the total s. But note: the same total s might be achieved by multiple participants, and the jury can assign the places arbitrarily (so we can assume that we can break ties arbitrarily in our favor or against us).\n\n 4. To compute the best place:\n    We want to minimize the number of participants that have a total >= Vasya's total (because if there are k participants with total >= Vasya's total, then Vasya's rank is at most k+1). But note: the ranking is by descending order, so the highest total gets the first place. \n\n    However, in the best case scenario, we can arrange the other participants (and Vasya) so that as few as possible participants have a total greater than or equal to Vasya's, and we can even break ties arbitrarily.\n\n    Specifically, for the best place:\n        We can choose Vasya's scores (a_i, b_j) such that his total is as high as possible? Not necessarily. Actually, we want to minimize the number of participants that have a total >= Vasya's. \n\n    Alternatively, we can fix Vasya's total to be T (with T>=x). Then, we can assign the rest of the participants (which are n-1) to have totals that are as low as possible, so that we minimize the count of participants (including Vasya) with total >= T.\n\n    However, note: the entire set of participants is fixed. We have two arrays a and b. The entire set of totals for all participants is {a_i + b_j for all pairs (i,j)} but wait: actually, each participant has one a_i and one b_j, but the assignment of which a_i goes with which b_j is arbitrary. \n\n    But note: the problem does not specify that the same participant's two scores are independent. In fact, the problem says: \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" meaning two lists of n numbers. This implies that we have two multisets and we can assign any a_i to any b_j to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The key insight is that the ranking depends on how his total points compare to others, considering all possible pairings of the given scores from the two tours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - We are given two lists of integers representing scores from the first and second tours.\n   - Vasya's total score must be at least `x`, but we don't know which scores he received in each tour.\n   - The goal is to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) rank Vasya can achieve by considering all possible valid combinations of his scores.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Rank**: To get the best rank, we need to maximize the number of participants with totals strictly greater than Vasya's. This involves pairing Vasya's highest possible score with another participant's highest possible score in a way that minimizes the count of higher-scoring participants.\n   - **Worst Rank**: To get the worst rank, we need to minimize the number of participants with totals strictly greater than Vasya's. This involves pairing Vasya's lowest possible score (still meeting the minimum `x`) with other participants' scores in a way that maximizes the count of higher-scoring participants.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting and Two Pointers**: We sort both lists of scores. For the best rank, we use a two-pointer technique to count how many participants can have totals greater than Vasya's chosen total. Similarly, for the worst rank, we adjust Vasya's total to be just above `x` and count participants with higher totals.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting both lists takes O(n log n) time.\n   - The two-pointer traversal is O(n) for each scenario (best and worst), leading to an overall O(n log n) time complexity, which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort()\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    total_list = [a + b for a, b in zip(a_list, b_list)]\n    total_list.sort()\n    \n    best_place = 1\n    worst_place = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the best place\n    s = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        while j >= 0 and a_list[i] + b_list[j] > s:\n            s += 1\n            j -= 1\n        if s == n:\n            break\n            \n    best_place = n - j\n    \n    # Calculate the worst place\n    s = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        while j >= 0 and a_list[i] + b_list[j] >= x:\n            s += 1\n            j -= 1\n        if s == n:\n            break\n            \n    worst_place = n - j\n    \n    print(f\"{best_place} {worst_place}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum required total score `x`, and the two lists of scores from the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted to facilitate efficient pairing using a two-pointer technique.\n3. **Best Rank Calculation**: By traversing the sorted lists from the end, we count how many participants have totals greater than Vasya's chosen total (initially set to the maximum possible). The best rank is then derived from this count.\n4. **Worst Rank Calculation**: Similarly, we traverse the sorted lists to count participants with totals at least `x`. The worst rank is derived from this count by considering Vasya's minimal valid total.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed, providing the solution to the problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible ranks by leveraging sorting and a two-pointer method, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
