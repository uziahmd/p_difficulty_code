Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\n Conditions for a non-degenerate triangle: x + y > z.\n\n Since the sides are constrained by ranges, we can use the following approach:\n\n Let:\n   x in [A, B]\n   y in [B, C]   (Note: since B<=C, and also note that the condition is B<=y<=C)\n   z in [C, D]\n\n However, note that the constraints on x, y, z are independent except for the triangle inequality.\n\n The total number without the triangle condition is (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1). But we have to subtract the degenerate cases.\n\n Alternatively, we can fix two variables and then count the valid third variable. However, the ranges are large (up to 500000) so we need an efficient method.\n\n Another idea: use the necessary and sufficient condition for the triangle: \n   x + y > z, and note that we already have x+y >= A+B >= ... but wait, we also know that the sides must satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\n However, note that we have fixed ranges and the triangle inequality for sides (a,b,c) requires a+b>c, a+c>b, b+c>a. \n But since x<=y<=z (because x<=B<=y<=C<=z) then the most restrictive condition is x+y>z (the others: \n   x+z>y -> because z>=y and x>=A (positive) so x+z>=A+y>=A+B>=... but note: actually, since x<=y<=z, we have:\n     x+z>=x+y>=? Actually, the condition x+z>y is automatically satisfied if x+y>z and z>=y? Not exactly.\n\n Let's check: \n   Condition 1: x+y>z (most restrictive)\n   Condition 2: x+z>y -> since x>=A>0, and z>=y, then x+z >= A+y. But we require x+z>y. Since z>=y, then x+z>=x+y. And x+y>y? Yes because x>=A>=1. So condition 2 is automatically satisfied.\n   Condition 3: y+z>x -> similarly, since y>=B>=A and z>=C>=B, then y+z>=B+C>=A+A>=2A, which is greater than x (since x<=B<=C, and x is at least A). But wait, we must be cautious: the minimal x is A, and minimal y+z is B+C. We need to check if B+C > A? Given that A<=B<=C, then B+C >= A+A = 2A, and since A>=1, then 2A>=2, and A can be as large as 500000? Actually, the minimal x is A, and the minimal y+z is B+C (with B>=A, C>=B) so B+C>=A+A=2A. Then 2A>A, so condition 3 is automatically satisfied.\n\n Therefore, we only need to ensure x+y>z.\n\n Now, we can break down the problem:\n\n We have three ranges:\n   x in [A, B]\n   y in [B, C]\n   z in [C, D]\n\n And we require x+y>z.\n\n We can fix x and y, then z must be in [C, min(D, floor(x+y-1)] (because z < x+y, and z must be integer, so z <= x+y-1). But note: we also have z>=C and z<=D.\n\n However, iterating over x from A to B and y from B to C would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which can be up to 500000*500000, too slow.\n\n Alternative approach: iterate over x and y is too heavy, so we need to invert the problem.\n\n We can fix z (the largest side) and then count pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C].\n\n But note: the condition on x and y: x<=B<=y<=C, so x is at least A and at most B, y is at least B and at most C.\n\n For fixed z, we require x+y > z.\n\n How many pairs (x,y) satisfy A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, and x+y>z?\n\n We can precompute the count of pairs (x,y) for each z, but then we must consider z from C to D (which is up to 500000) and for each z, we would still need to iterate over x or y? That would be too slow.\n\n Instead, we can fix x and y and then determine the range of z that satisfies z < x+y and z>=C and z<=D. Then we can use prefix sums or something similar.\n\n Alternatively, we can count the total number of triangles and subtract the ones that do not satisfy the triangle condition? But note: the condition is only one side (x+y>z) and the other two conditions are automatically satisfied.\n\n But wait, let me reexamine: we have established that the other conditions are automatically satisfied. So we can count all triples (x,y,z) and subtract those that do not satisfy x+y>z.\n\n However, note: the condition for degenerate triangle is x+y<=z. But actually, we require non-degenerate, so we want x+y>z.\n\n So total triples without condition: T = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\n Then subtract the triples for which x+y<=z.\n\n But how to count the triples with x+y<=z?\n\n Conditions:\n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D] and x+y<=z.\n\n We can fix x and y, then z must be in [max(C, x+y), D]. But note: we require x+y<=z, so z>=x+y. However, z must be at least C. So the lower bound for z is max(C, x+y). But we must also have x+y<=D? Actually, if x+y>D then there is no z. \n\n But note: we are counting the triples (x,y,z) that satisfy A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D and x+y<=z.\n\n We can change the order: fix x and y, then the condition on z is: z >= max(C, x+y) and z<=D. So the number of z for fixed x,y is: max(0, D - max(C, x+y) + 1).\n\n Then the total invalid triples is: sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} max(0, D - max(C, x+y) + 1) ?\n\n However, note: the condition x+y<=z and z>=C. But if x+y < C, then we require z>=C and z<=D, so the count is (D-C+1). If x+y >= C, then we require z>=x+y and z<=D, so the count is (D - x+y + 1) but only if x+y<=D, else 0.\n\n Actually, for fixed x,y, the condition x+y<=z is equivalent to z>=x+y. But we also have z>=C. So the lower bound for z is L = max(C, x+y) and then the count is: \n   if L > D: 0\n   else: D - L + 1\n\n Then the total invalid = sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} max(0, D - max(C, x+y) + 1)\n\n But note: the ranges for x and y are independent, and the inner loop over y for each x would be too heavy (O(B-A+1) * (C-B+1) ~ 500000*500000).\n\n We need to optimize the counting.\n\n We can break the double sum into two parts:\n\n Part 1: when x+y < C, then the lower bound is C, so the count for (x,y) is (D-C+1) for each (x,y) with x+y < C.\n\n Part 2: when x+y >= C, then the lower bound is x+y, so the count is (D - (x+y) + 1) for each (x,y) with x+y>=C and x+y<=D (if x+y>D, then count=0).\n\n But note: if x+y>=C and x+y<=D, then count = D - (x+y) + 1. Otherwise (x+y>D) then 0.\n\n However, the entire range of x+y might be very large. We can try to use two-dimensional prefix sums, but note that x+y can go from A+B (minimal) to B+C (maximal). The range of x+y is [A+B, B+C]. The value of A+B is at least 2 (since A>=1) and B+C is at most 1000000 (since B,C<=500000).\n\n But the total distinct values of x+y is about (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C - A + 1) which is up to 500000. \n\n Alternatively, we can iterate over x and then for each x, we can find the range of y such that x+y < C and the range where x+y>=C and x+y<=D.\n\n However, we still have two loops. We need to use a different approach.\n\n Idea: Instead of iterating over x and y, we can fix the sum s = x+y, and then count the pairs (x,y) that yield s, and then for each s, we know the contribution to the invalid count.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Precompute the frequency of x+y for x in [A,B] and y in [B,C]. But note: x and y are independent, so the possible s is from A+B to B+C.\n\n  2. Then, for each s from A+B to B+C, we know the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y=s.\n\n     How to count pairs (x,y) with x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and x+y=s?\n        => x in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] and y = s-x must be in [B, C].\n        => The condition on x: \n            x >= max(A, s-C)\n            x <= min(B, s-B)\n\n        But note: we also require y = s-x to be in [B, C] which is equivalent to:\n            s-x >= B  => x <= s-B\n            s-x <= C  => x >= s-C\n\n        So x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] and also the interval must be non-empty.\n\n  3. Then, for a given s, the contribution to the invalid count is:\n        If s < C: then for each pair (x,y) with x+y=s, the count for z is (D-C+1) [because z must be at least C, and we have x+y=s < C, so z from C to D].\n        If C <= s <= D: then for each pair (x,y) with x+y=s, the count for z is (D - s + 1) [because z must be from s to D].\n        If s > D: then no z satisfies (since z<=D and we require z>=s>D), so 0.\n\n  4. Then, the total invalid count is:\n        invalid = 0\n        for s from A+B to B+C:\n            count_s = number of (x,y) pairs with x+y=s\n            if s < C:\n                invalid += count_s * (D - C + 1)\n            elif s <= D:\n                invalid += count_s * (D - s + 1)\n            # else: s > D, skip\n\n  5. Then answer = total_triples - invalid, where total_triples = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1)\n\n But wait: the above method counts the invalid triples (with x+y<=z) by grouping by s=x+y. However, note that in the invalid condition we have z>=max(C, s). In our breakdown, we considered:\n        For s < C: then z>=C, so the count for z is (D-C+1).\n        For s>=C and s<=D: then z>=s, so the count is (D-s+1).\n\n But note: the condition for invalid triple is x+y<=z, and we broke it by s=x+y and then the z must be at least max(C, s). This is correct.\n\n However, the challenge is to compute count_s (the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y=s, with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C]) efficiently.\n\n We can iterate s from A+B to B+C, but the range of s is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1) which is up to 500000, which is acceptable.\n\n But how to compute count_s for each s?\n\n        x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] and also we require that y = s-x is in [B, C]. But note that the condition on y is automatically enforced by the bounds on x? \n\n        Conditions from y: \n            y = s-x >= B  => x <= s-B\n            y = s-x <= C  => x >= s-C\n\n        And we also require x in [A,B]. So the x must be in [L, R] where:\n            L = max(A, s-C, ...) but note: the condition from y gives x>=s-C and x<=s-B, and then we intersect with [A,B].\n\n        So the valid x are in the intersection: [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)].\n\n        Then count_s = max(0, min(B, s-B) - max(A, s-C) + 1)   provided that the interval is non-empty.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the condition on y is built into the bounds for x (via s-C and s-B). \n\n Example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, and s=3.\n        x must be in [max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1, min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1] -> x=1, then y=2 which is in [B,C]=[2,3] -> valid.\n\n Example: s=4: \n        x in [max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1, min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2] -> x can be 1 or 2.\n          x=1 -> y=3 (valid)\n          x=2 -> y=2 (valid)\n\n        So count_s for s=4 is 2.\n\n But wait, what if s is too small or too large?\n        s_min = A+B = 1+2=3, s_max = B+C=2+3=5.\n\n        s=5: \n            x in [max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2, min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2] -> x=2, then y=3 -> valid.\n\n        s=2: not in the range [3,5] so we skip.\n\n Therefore, we can iterate s from max(A+B, C) ? No, we must start from A+B to B+C.\n\n However, note: the condition for the invalid triple breaks at C, but we are iterating s from A+B to B+C.\n\n But note: the total number of s is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1) which is at most 500000, so we can iterate.\n\n Steps:\n\n   total_triples = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\n   invalid = 0\n   s_low = A+B\n   s_high = B+C\n\n   for s in range(s_low, s_high+1):\n        low_x = max(A, s-C)\n        high_x = min(B, s-B)\n\n        if low_x > high_x:\n            count_s = 0\n        else:\n            count_s = high_x - low_x + 1\n\n        # Now, we must ensure that for each x in [low_x, high_x], the corresponding y = s-x is in [B, C]? \n        # But note: we set low_x = max(A, s-C) and high_x = min(B, s-B). \n        # Condition for y: y = s-x must be between B and C.\n        #   s-x >= B  => x <= s-B -> which is our high_x\n        #   s-x <= C  => x >= s-C -> which is our low_x\n        # So the conditions are built in. Therefore, every x in [low_x, high_x] gives a valid y.\n\n        if s < C:\n            invalid += count_s * (D - C + 1)\n        elif s <= D:\n            invalid += count_s * (D - s + 1)\n        # else: s > D, then no z, so nothing.\n\n   answer = total_triples - invalid\n\n But wait: is this correct?\n\n Let's test with the example: \"1 2 3 4\" (A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4)\n\n total_triples = (2-1+1) * (3-2+1) * (4-3+1) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\n Now, we break down the invalid triples (x+y<=z):\n\n   s from 3 to 5 (since A+B=3, B+C=5)\n\n   s=3:\n        low_x = max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1\n        high_x = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n        count_s=1\n        s<3? no, 3==C, so we use the elif: s<=D -> yes, so invalid += 1*(4-3+1) = 1*2 = 2.\n\n   s=4:\n        low_x = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n        high_x = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n        count_s = 2-1+1=2\n        s=4<=4 -> invalid += 2*(4-4+1)=2*1=2.\n\n   s=5:\n        low_x = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n        high_x = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2\n        count_s=1\n        s=5>4 -> skip.\n\n   invalid = 2+2 = 4.\n\n   Then answer = 8 - 4 = 4.\n\n The example output is 4, so it matches.\n\n Another example: \"1 2 2 5\" (A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5)\n\n total_triples = (2-1+1) * (2-2+1) * (5-2+1) = 2 * 1 * 4 = 8.\n\n Now, s from 1+2=3 to 2+2=4.\n\n   s=3:\n        low_x = max(1,3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n        high_x = min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n        count_s=1\n        s=3 > C=2 -> so we use elif: s<=5 -> invalid += 1*(5-3+1)=1*3=3.\n\n   s=4:\n        low_x = max(1,4-2)=max(1,2)=2\n        high_x = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n        count_s=1\n        invalid += 1*(5-4+1)=1*2=2.\n\n   invalid = 3+2 = 5.\n\n   answer = 8-5=3.\n\n Matches the example.\n\n But wait, the example input \"1 2 2 5\" is given as:\n\n    Input: ['1 2 2 5'] -> Output: 3.\n\n However, note: the example output is 3.\n\n Another example: \"500000 500000 500000 500000\"\n\n   A=B=C=D=500000\n\n   total_triples = (500000-500000+1)^3 = 1^3 = 1.\n\n   s from 500000+500000=1000000 to 500000+500000=1000000.\n\n   s=1000000:\n        low_x = max(500000,1000000-500000)=max(500000,500000)=500000\n        high_x = min(500000,1000000-500000)=min(500000,500000)=500000\n        count_s=1\n\n        s=1000000 > C=500000 -> so we use elif: s<=500000? No, 1000000>500000 -> then we skip (since s>D=500000? Actually, D=500000, so s=1000000>D -> condition s<=D fails, so we don't add.\n\n   invalid = 0.\n\n   answer = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n   Matches.\n\n However, note: the example input says: ['500000 500000 500000 500000'] -> output '1'\n\n But wait: in the example, the condition is that the triple must satisfy x+y>z. With x=y=z=500000, we have 500000+500000>500000 -> true, so it is a valid triangle. So our count should include it. \n\n However, in our method, we subtract the invalid ones. The invalid ones are those with x+y<=z. The only triple is (500000,500000,500000) and 500000+500000=1000000>500000, so it is not invalid. Hence, we did not subtract it, so we got 1.\n\n But wait, in the example, the condition for invalid was broken down by s=x+y=1000000, and then we checked: if s<=D (which is 500000)? 1000000<=500000 is false, so we skipped. Then we did not subtract. So the invalid count is 0, and the answer is 1.\n\n So the code is:\n\n   Read A, B, C, D.\n\n   total = (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1)\n\n   s_low = A+B\n   s_high = B+C\n\n   invalid = 0\n   for s in range(s_low, s_high+1):\n        low_x = max(A, s-C)\n        high_x = min(B, s-B)\n\n        if low_x > high_x:\n            count_s = 0\n        else:\n            count_s = high_x - low_x + 1\n\n        if s < C:\n            invalid += count_s * (D - C + 1)\n        elif s <= D:\n            invalid += count_s * (D - s + 1)\n\n   print(total - invalid)\n\n However, note: the range of s is from A+B to B+C, which is (B+C - A - B + 1) = (C-A+1). The maximum value of C-A+1 is 500000, so the loop runs at most 500000 times, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait, what if A+B > B+C? Then the loop runs from A+B to B+C, but if A+B>B+C then the range is empty. However, since A<=B<=C, we have A+B <= B+C (because A<=C). So the loop is safe.\n\n However, note: the example \"1 2 3 4\": A+B=3, B+C=5 -> 3<=5.\n\n But what if the input is such that A+B>B+C? That cannot happen because A<=B<=C implies A+B<=B+C.\n\n But wait, if A<=B<=C, then A+B <= B+C? \n        A+B <= B+C  <=> A <= C, which is given.\n\n So the loop is safe.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say A<=B<=C<=D, so we are safe.\n\n But there's a catch: the value of s might be very large? The maximum s is B+C, which is at most 1000000 (since B and C are up to 500000). So the loop runs from A+B (at least 2) to B+C (at most 1000000) -> 1000000 steps, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait, worst-case: A=1, B=500000, C=500000, then s_low=500001, s_high=1000000. Then the loop runs 500000 steps, which is acceptable.\n\n However, note: the problem constraints say that A,B,C,D can be up to 500000, so the maximum s is 1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait, the worst-case for the range of s is from A+B (minimum 2) to B+C (maximum 1000000). The number of s values is at most 1000000, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the problem constraints say that the numbers can be as large as 500000, so the maximum s is 1000000, and we are iterating from A+B to B+C, which is about 1000000 steps. This is acceptable in Python? \n\n But note: worst-case 1000000 iterations is acceptable.\n\n But wait, there's a better way: we can avoid the loop by using arithmetic progression and cumulative sums. However, the problem size is only 1e6, so a loop of 1e6 is acceptable.\n\n But wait, the problem says D can be up to 500000, and the range of s is (B+C - A - B + 1) = (C-A+1) which is at most 500000. So the loop runs at most 500000 times. Actually, the range is from A+B to B+C, so the number of integers is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1) which is at most 500000. \n\n So the loop runs at most 500000 times, which is even better.\n\n However, let me recalc: \n        s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C, then the number of s is (B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C - A + 1.\n\n        Since A<=B<=C, then C-A+1 <= C-A+? Actually, C-A+1 is the length of the interval [A, C] in terms of consecutive integers, but here we are just counting the number of s.\n\n        The worst-case for C-A+1 is when A=1, C=500000, then 500000, which is acceptable.\n\n Code:\n\n   A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\n   total = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1)\n\n   s_low = A + B\n   s_high = B + C\n\n   invalid = 0\n   # We'll iterate over s from s_low to s_high\n   # But note: sometimes s_low might be greater than s_high? No, because A<=B<=C, so A+B <= B+C.\n\n   for s in range(s_low, s_high+1):\n        low_x = max(A, s - C)\n        high_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n        if low_x > high_x:\n            count_s = 0\n        else:\n            count_s = high_x - low_x + 1\n\n        if s < C:\n            # Then the condition for z is z>=C, and the number of z is (D-C+1)\n            invalid += count_s * (D - C + 1)\n        elif s <= D:\n            invalid += count_s * (D - s + 1)\n\n   print(total - invalid)\n\n However, wait: in the condition for the invalid triple, we are counting the triples (x,y,z) that satisfy x+y<=z. But note: the condition for the triple is that x,y,z must be in their respective intervals. Our count_s counts pairs (x,y) such that x+y=s and the x,y are in the allowed ranges. Then for each such (x,y) we count the z's that are at least max(C,s) and at most D.\n\n But note: the condition for the triple is that z must be in [C, D] and also z>=s (for the invalid case). However, if s<C, then the condition becomes z>=C, which is independent of s. But we are counting the same (x,y) pairs for all z from C to D. \n\n This is correct.\n\n However, let me test with a small example that might break: A=1, B=3, C=3, D=5.\n\n   x in [1,3], y in [3,3] (so y=3), z in [3,5].\n\n   total_triples = (3-1+1) * (3-3+1) * (5-3+1) = 3 * 1 * 3 = 9.\n\n   Now, the condition for non-degenerate: x+y>z -> 1+3=4, 2+3=5, 3+3=6.\n\n   So the invalid triples are those with x+y<=z.\n\n   Possibilities:\n\n      x=1: y=3 -> x+y=4: then z must be <=4. z in [3,4] -> z=3,4 -> two invalid.\n      x=2: y=3 -> x+y=5: then z<=5 -> all z: 3,4,5 -> three invalid.\n      x=3: y=3 -> x+y=6: then z<=6 -> but z<=5, so all z: 3,4,5 -> three invalid.\n\n   Total invalid = 2+3+3 = 8.\n\n   Then answer = 9-8=1.\n\n   Now, let's compute by our code:\n\n        s_low = 1+3=4, s_high=3+3=6.\n\n        s=4:\n            low_x = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n            high_x = min(3,4-3)=min(3,1)=1\n            count_s=1\n            s=4>=C=3 -> then check s<=D=5 -> yes, so invalid += 1*(5-4+1)=1*2=2.\n\n        s=5:\n            low_x = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n            high_x = min(3,5-3)=min(3,2)=2\n            count_s=1\n            invalid += 1*(5-5+1)=1*1=1.\n\n        s=6:\n            low_x = max(1,6-3)=max(1,3)=3\n            high_x = min(3,6-3)=min(3,3)=3\n            count_s=1\n            s=6<=5? no, so skip.\n\n        invalid = 2+1 = 3.\n\n        Then answer = 9-3=6, which is not 1.\n\n What's wrong?\n\n Let me reexamine: the condition for invalid is x+y<=z. In our breakdown by s, we are counting for a fixed s (which is x+y) the z's that are >= s (if s>=C) or >=C (if s<C). But note: the condition for invalid is x+y<=z, so for a fixed (x,y) (which has x+y=s) we count the z's that are >= s (if s>=C) OR >=C (if s<C) but note: if s<C, then the condition x+y<=z is equivalent to z>=C (since s<C and z>=C, then z>=C>s, so x+y=s<=z). But wait, if s<C, then z>=C implies z>=s (because s<C<=z) so the condition z>=C implies x+y<=z. However, if s<C, then the condition x+y<=z is automatically satisfied for every z in [C, D] (because z>=C>s). \n\n But wait, in the example with s=4 (which is >=C=3) we did the right thing: we counted the z's from 4 to 5 (which are 2: z=4,5). But note: the condition for invalid is x+y<=z. For (x,y)=(1,3): s=4, then z must be at least 4 (because 4<=z) and at most 5. So z=4 and 5. But wait, the condition for invalid is x+y<=z, so for z=4: 4<=4 -> invalid, for z=5: 4<=5 -> invalid. So two invalid for (1,3). Similarly, for (2,3): s=5, then z>=5 and <=5, so only z=5. One invalid. For (3,3): s=6, then z>=6, but z<=5, so none.\n\n So according to the condition, the invalid triples are:\n   (1,3,3), (1,3,4), (1,3,5) -> wait, no: the triple (1,3,5): x+y=4, 4<=5 -> invalid. But wait, we have to remember: the triple is (x,y,z) and we are counting (x,y) pairs and then z from [C, D] that are >= max(C, s). \n\n However, note: the condition for invalid is x+y<=z. So for (1,3,5): x+y=4<=5 -> invalid. But our code for s=4 (which is x+y=4) counts z>=4 (so z=4 and 5) -> two invalid for (1,3). But wait, the triple (1,3,5) is invalid, and (1,3,4) is invalid. \n\n Now, for (2,3): s=5, we count z>=5 -> only z=5. So (2,3,5) is invalid.\n\n For (3,3): s=6, we don't count any invalid.\n\n So the invalid triples are: (1,3,3), (1,3,4), (1,3,5), (2,3,5) -> four invalid.\n\n Then the answer should be 9-4=5.\n\n But wait, the manual count earlier was 8? I think I miscounted.\n\n Let me recount:\n\n   x=1, y=3: z can be 3,4,5 -> all three are invalid because 1+3=4, and 4<=3? no, wait: \n        Actually, the condition for invalid is x+y<=z, so for (1,3,3): 1+3<=3 -> 4<=3 -> false -> valid? \n        Wait, no: the condition for non-degenerate is x+y>z. So the triangle is valid if 1+3>3 -> 4>3 -> true. So (1,3,3) is valid.\n\n        But wait, the problem states: non-degenerate triangle. The condition for non-degenerate is that the sum of two sides must be greater than the third. The triangle inequality: \n            a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints \\(A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D\\), we can simplify the problem by recognizing that the most restrictive condition is \\(x + y > z\\), since the other conditions \\(x + z > y\\) and \\(y + z > x\\) are automatically satisfied due to the ordering of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), such that \\(x + y > z\\). The key insight is that for each pair \\((x, y)\\), the valid \\(z\\) values must be less than \\(x + y\\) and within the range \\([C, D]\\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: Instead of iterating over all possible triples (which would be computationally expensive), we can iterate over possible sums \\(s = x + y\\) and count the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) for each sum. For each sum \\(s\\), the number of invalid \\(z\\) values (those that make the triangle degenerate) is determined by how many \\(z\\) values in \\([C, D]\\) satisfy \\(z \\geq s\\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Total Triples Calculation**: First, compute the total number of triples without any constraints, which is \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1) \\times (D - C + 1)\\).\n   - **Invalid Triples Calculation**: For each possible sum \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\), count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y = s\\) and \\(x \\in [A, B]\\), \\(y \\in [B, C]\\). For each such sum \\(s\\), if \\(s < C\\), all \\(z\\) values from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\) are invalid; otherwise, \\(z\\) values from \\(s\\) to \\(D\\) are invalid.\n   - **Result Calculation**: Subtract the number of invalid triples from the total triples to get the answer.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm iterates over all possible sums \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\), which is \\(O(C - A)\\) operations. Since \\(C - A\\) can be up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\), this approach efficiently handles the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    total_triples = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) * (D - C + 1)\n    \n    s_low = A + B\n    s_high = B + C\n    \n    invalid_count = 0\n    for s in range(s_low, s_high + 1):\n        low_x = max(A, s - C)\n        high_x = min(B, s - B)\n        \n        if low_x > high_x:\n            count_s = 0\n        else:\n            count_s = high_x - low_x + 1\n            \n        if s < C:\n            invalid_count += count_s * (D - C + 1)\n        elif s <= D:\n            invalid_count += count_s * (D - s + 1)\n            \n    result = total_triples - invalid_count\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) read from standard input.\n2. **Total Triples Calculation**: The total number of triples \\((x, y, z)\\) without any constraints is computed as \\((B - A + 1) \\times (C - B + 1) \\times (D - C + 1)\\).\n3. **Invalid Triples Calculation**: For each possible sum \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\):\n   - Determine the range of \\(x\\) values that satisfy \\(x + y = s\\) with \\(y\\) in \\([B, C]\\).\n   - Count the number of valid \\(x\\) values for each \\(s\\).\n   - If \\(s < C\\), all \\(z\\) values from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\) are invalid for these pairs.\n   - If \\(s \\leq D\\), \\(z\\) values from \\(s\\) to \\(D\\) are invalid.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is obtained by subtracting the count of invalid triples from the total triples and printing the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid triangles by leveraging mathematical insights and careful iteration over possible sums, ensuring optimal performance even for large input ranges.",
