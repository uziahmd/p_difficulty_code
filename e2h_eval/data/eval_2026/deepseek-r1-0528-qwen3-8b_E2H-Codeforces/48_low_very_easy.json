He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000). The number is guaranteed to be representable.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given string c (which is in base a) to an integer in base 10.\n    Since the string may have leading zeros, we can use int(c, base=a) but note: the base a is between 2 and 25, and the digits might include letters? However, the problem says \"the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" only if not Roman, but when Roman is included the number is at most 300010 and non-zero.\n\n    But note: the input c is given in base a, and a is between 2 and 25. The digits in base a can be from '0' to str(a-1). However, for bases above 10, we use letters? Actually, the example includes base 12 and digit 'A' (which is 10). So we need to handle that.\n\n    How to convert?\n      We can do: \n        num = 0\n        for each char in c:\n            d = digit_to_int(char)\n            num = num * a + d\n\n    But note: the string might contain digits that are letters. For example, in base 16, we have 'A' meaning 10. However, our base a is at least 2 and at most 25, so we need to map the characters.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the built-in int function? But wait: the problem says the number c is in base a and may contain leading zeros. The built-in int does not allow bases above 36, but our base is up to 25, so it's okay. However, the digits must be in the range [0, a-1]. The input string may contain digits represented by characters. For bases above 10, we use letters from 'A' onward? Actually, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n    Example: base 12, the digits go from 0 to 11. So we would use '0','1',...,'9','A','B'. \n\n    The built-in int uses base conversion for bases up to 36, and uses the usual letters. But note: the input string might have digits beyond '9'? Only if base is >10. And the problem says the string has digits that are either digits or letters (from 'A').\n\n    However, the problem does not specify the exact representation for bases above 10. It says \"A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n    Let's check: \n        In base 12, the number 10 is represented as 'A'. So yes.\n\n    But note: the input string for base 12 might have a digit 'A' (which is 10) and that is valid.\n\n    However, using the built-in int with base a works only if the string contains digits and letters that are valid for base a. But the built-in int for base a will stop at the maximum digit value (a-1). But wait: what if the string contains a digit that is invalid? The problem says the input is in base a, so we assume valid digits.\n\n    But note: the problem says the next line is a non-negative integer c in base a. So we can safely use:\n\n        n = int(c, base=a)\n\n    However, there's a catch: the problem says the input string may contain leading zeros. The int function handles that.\n\n    But wait: what about the Roman numeral case? In the Roman numeral case, we are not given a base b, but the letter 'R'. However, the first token is still a base a, then the second token is 'R'. Then we have the string c in base a.\n\n    However, the problem states: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\". So even if we are converting to Roman, we still have to convert the string c from base a to base 10 first.\n\n 2. Now, if b is an integer (not 'R'), then we convert the base-10 number to base b (without leading zeros). Similarly, if b is 'R', then we convert the base-10 number to a Roman numeral.\n\n 3.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, which could either be a standard base or a Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, then converting it to the desired output base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input String to Base 10**: The input number is provided as a string in base `a`. We first convert this string into a base 10 integer. This involves processing each digit of the string, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value by multiplying the current total by the base `a` and adding the digit's value.\n2. **Convert Base 10 to Output Base**: If the target base `b` is an integer, we convert the base 10 number to base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting the remainders. These remainders are then mapped to their corresponding digits (using letters for values greater than 9) and reversed to form the final result.\n3. **Convert Base 10 to Roman Numerals**: If the target base `b` is 'R', we convert the base 10 number to Roman numerals. This involves mapping the number to its Roman numeral equivalent by breaking it down into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, using predefined mappings for each place value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    a_str = parts[0]\n    b_str = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n    \n    c_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input for base a\")\n        return\n        \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        b = 'R'\n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(b_str)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input for base b\")\n            return\n\n    n_base10 = 0\n    for char in c_str:\n        if '0' <= char <= '9':\n            d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n        else:\n            d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            \n        if d >= a:\n            print(\"Invalid digit for base\", a)\n            return\n            \n        n_base10 = n_base10 * a + d\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        if n_base10 == 0:\n            print(\"\")\n        else:\n            roman_numerals = []\n            # Thousands\n            for _ in range(n_base10 // 1000):\n                roman_numerals.append('M')\n                n_base10 %= 1000\n            # Hundreds\n            if n_base10 >= 900:\n                roman_numerals.append('CM')\n                n_base10 -= 900\n            elif n_base10 >= 500:\n                roman_numerals.append('D')\n                n_base10 -= 500\n            elif n_base10 >= 400:\n                roman_numerals.append('CD')\n                n_base10 -= 400\n            elif n_base10 >= 100:\n                roman_numerals.append('C')\n                n_base10 -= 100\n            elif n_base10 >= 90:\n                roman_numerals.append('XC')\n                n_base10 -= 90\n            elif n_base10 >= 50:\n                roman_numerals.append('L')\n                n_base10 -= 50\n            elif n_base10 >= 40:\n                roman_numerals.append('XL')\n                n_base10 -= 40\n            elif n_base10 >= 10:\n                roman_numerals.append('X')\n                n_base10 -= 10\n            elif n_base10 >= 9:\n                roman_numerals.append('IX')\n                n_base10 -= 9\n            elif n_base10 >= 5:\n                roman_numerals.append('V')\n                n_base10 -= 5\n            elif n_base10 >= 4:\n                roman_numerals.append('IV')\n                n_base10 -= 4\n            elif n_base10 >= 1:\n                roman_numerals.append('I')\n                n_base10 -= 1\n                \n            result = ''.join(roman_numerals)\n            print(result)\n    else:\n        if n_base10 == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            while n_base10:\n                n_base10, r = divmod(n_base10, b)\n                if r < 10:\n                    digits.append(str(r))\n                else:\n                    digits.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n                    \n            result = ''.join(digits[::-1])\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains the bases `a` and `b`, where `b` can be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals. The second line is the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The number `c` is converted from base `a` to a base 10 integer by processing each character in the string, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Standard Base**: If `b` is an integer, the base 10 number is converted to base `b` by repeated division. The remainders are collected, mapped to their respective digits (using letters for values 10 and above), and reversed to form the result.\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If `b` is 'R', the base 10 number is broken down into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units. Each segment is mapped to its corresponding Roman numeral symbols, following the rules of Roman numeral formation (e.g., subtractive notation for numbers like 4 and 9).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
