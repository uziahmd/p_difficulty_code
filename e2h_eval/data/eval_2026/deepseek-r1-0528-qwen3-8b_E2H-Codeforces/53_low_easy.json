    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Since the string is short, we can try to consider every substring and check for duplicates.\n However, note: We need the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. If the string length is less than 2, then no duplicate substring of length>=1? Actually, if the string is of length 1, then we cannot have two same substrings (unless there's at least two same characters? But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", meaning two occurrences). So for a string of length 1, the answer is 0.\n\n 2. We can iterate over all possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (which is len(s)//2 + something) down to 1, and check for each length if there's any substring that appears at least twice.\n\n 3. Alternatively, we can generate all substrings and store their frequency. Then look for the maximum length where the frequency is at least 2.\n\n However, note: the problem allows overlapping occurrences. Example: \"ababa\" -> the substring \"aba\" appears twice (at index0 and index2).\n\n Approach:\n  Let n = len(s)\n  We can iterate over lengths from floor(n/2) down to 1 (because if a substring of length L appears twice, then L must be <= n//2, but actually it can be up to n//2? Actually, the two occurrences can start at indices i and j, and the condition is that the substring of length L starting at i and at j must be the same, and we require that the two occurrences are distinct (so j-i >= L? Actually, they can overlap, so j can be as low as i+1, meaning the next character after the first occurrence starts at i+1. But the condition is just that the two substrings are the same, and they are contiguous in the string.\n\n  But note: The two occurrences can be anywhere, even overlapping arbitrarily. However, the maximum length L such that the substring appears twice must satisfy: the entire substring of length L must appear at least twice. The maximum L can be at most floor((n+1)/2) ? Actually, consider \"aaa\": \n      n=3, maximum duplicate substring: \n          length 2: \"aa\" appears at [0:2] and [1:3] -> two times.\n          length 3: \"aaa\" only once.\n\n  Actually, the maximum L can be up to floor(n/2) because if you have two non-overlapping occurrences, then L <= n/2. But with overlapping, we can have longer substrings? Actually, no, because the two occurrences must be distinct. The minimal distance between the two starting indices is 0? Actually, they must be distinct. But note: the problem doesn't require non-overlapping. However, the substring itself is contiguous. \n\n  Example: \"abcabcabc\", the substring \"abc\" appears 3 times, but also \"bca\" appears 2 times, etc. The longest substring that appears at least twice? \n      For example, the substring of length 4: \"abca\" appears at index0 and index3? Actually, \"abca\" is at index0 and then at index3? \n          s[0:4] = \"abca\", s[3:7] = \"cabc\" -> not the same. \n      How about \"abcabc\": \n          The entire string is 6, so we can have a substring of length 3 repeated: \"abc\" three times. But wait, what is the longest substring that appears twice?\n          Consider: \n            length 5: \"abcabc\" has two occurrences? No, because the entire string is one occurrence and then the next would require starting at index1: \"bcab\" (if we take 5 starting at index1: \"bcabc\") which is different from \"abcabc\". \n          Actually, the substring of length 5 appears only once.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"at least twice\". So we are looking for the maximum L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n  However, note: we can have a substring that appears more than twice, but we only care about the length.\n\n  We can do:\n\n  Option 1: Check from the maximum possible length (which is floor(n/2) + 1?) but actually, the maximum length we can have for a duplicate substring is floor(n/2) because if we have two occurrences, the first occurrence ends at index i+L-1 and the second starts at index j (with j < i+L) then the two substrings must not be identical if they are too long? Actually, the maximum length for a substring that appears twice (allowing overlap) is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which means we need to consider all possible substrings and check their frequencies efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters in a string that occurs at least twice. The key observation here is that the maximum possible length of such a substring is half the length of the string (since two overlapping occurrences must fit within the string). \n\n2. **Intuition**: We can start by checking all possible substrings from the longest possible down to the shortest. For each substring length, we check if any substring of that length appears at least twice in the string. The first length we find where this condition is met will be our answer since we are checking from the largest to the smallest.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (floor(n/2)) down to 1.\n   - For each length, generate all unique substrings of that length and count their occurrences.\n   - If any substring occurs at least twice, return the current length as the result.\n   - If no such substring is found after checking all lengths, return 0.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves nested loops: an outer loop for substring lengths and an inner loop for generating substrings. Given the constraints (string length ≤ 100), the approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n^3) in the worst case, which is feasible for small input sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n <= 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    max_length = n // 2\n    for L in range(max_length, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                seen[substr] += 1\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = 1\n        for count in seen.values():\n            if count >= 2:\n                print(L)\n                return\n                \n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If the string length is 1 or less, the output is immediately 0 since no substring can appear twice.\n- **Substring Length Check**: The algorithm checks from the maximum possible substring length (half the string length) down to 1. For each length, it generates all substrings of that length and records their frequencies.\n- **Frequency Check**: If any substring's frequency is at least 2, the current length is printed, and the program exits. If no such substring is found after all lengths are checked, the output is 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging the fact that longer substrings are less likely to repeat, thus optimizing the search process.",
