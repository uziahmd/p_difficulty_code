            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. We can draw any number of extra tiles (each draw adds one tile) and we can choose any tile.\n\n We want the minimum number of draws so that we have at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Since we start with 3 tiles, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Already have a mentsu -> then answer 0.\n\n Option 2: We might need to draw 1, 2, or even 3? But note: drawing one tile might form a mentsu (if we complete a triplet by drawing a duplicate, or complete a sequence). However, sometimes we might need two draws.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Conditions for a mentsu:\n   - Koutsu: three identical tiles (same digit and same suit).\n   - Shuntsu: three consecutive digits (with no repetition) in the same suit.\n\n We have three tiles. We can consider:\n\n Case 0: Already a mentsu? Then 0.\n\n Otherwise, we consider:\n\n Case 1: Drawing 1 tile.\n\n   For koutsu: if there is a pair (two same tiles), then drawing one more of the same tile gives a triplet.\n\n   For shuntsu: if we have two tiles that are part of a sequence, then drawing the missing tile (the next or previous) might complete the sequence.\n\n   Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> drawing 3m would complete [1m,2m,3m] and [2m,3m,4m] (but note we only need one mentsu). However, we don't necessarily have two tiles that form two parts of a sequence.\n\n   Actually, we can have:\n\n     - If we have two same tiles, then we can form a triplet by drawing one.\n     - Or, we might have two tiles that are consecutive and the third tile is different but in the same suit, then we can form a sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n   But note: we have three tiles. They might not be all in the same suit. So we must consider:\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Check if already has a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu). \n\n        For koutsu: \n            Count each distinct tile. If any tile appears 3 times, then yes.\n\n        For shuntsu:\n            Group by suit. Then for each suit, we have some numbers. Sort them and check for consecutive numbers (with step 1) in the same suit.\n\n   Step 2: If not, check if we can get a mentsu by drawing 1 tile.\n\n        Possibility 1: Form a koutsu from a pair.\n\n            If there is a tile that appears at least twice, then drawing one more will complete the triplet.\n\n        Possibility 2: Form a shuntsu.\n\n            We need to see if there exists a set of three consecutive numbers (in the same suit) that can be formed by the three tiles (or two of them and the drawn tile) in one of the suits.\n\n            However, note: we have three tiles. They might be distributed in two or three suits. We can consider each suit separately.\n\n            For a given suit, we look at the distinct numbers present. Then we can try to form a sequence of three consecutive numbers. But note: we might have duplicates.\n\n            Actually, we can also use the same tile multiple times? No, because we cannot use the same physical tile twice. But we can consider having two tiles of the same number? Then we can only use one.\n\n            How to check for a shuntsu possibility with one draw?\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (and leave out 4m) OR [2m,3m,4m]. But note: we are allowed to use any three tiles (so we can ignore the fourth). However, we only draw one tile and then we have four tiles, but we only need one mentsu (three tiles). So we can form one mentsu and leave the others.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"at least one mentsu\", so we don't require the entire hand to be a mentsu. We just need one set of three.\n\n            So for shuntsu:\n\n            Condition: In a given suit, we have at least two distinct numbers (since we need three consecutive, they must be at least two apart? Actually, we need three consecutive numbers). But we can have duplicates? \n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> we have two 1m and one 2m. Then we can form a shuntsu [1m,2m,?] but we are missing 3m. However, we can also form a koutsu for 1m if we draw another 1m (which we can do). But wait, we are checking for one draw: we can either complete a triplet or a sequence.\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to draw any tile. So we can choose to draw a tile that completes a triplet OR a tile that completes a sequence.\n\n            Therefore, if either condition (koutsu or shuntsu) is possible with one draw, then the answer is 1.\n\n            But note: we have three tiles. We might have two possibilities at the same time? Then still 1.\n\n            How to check for shuntsu with one draw?\n\n            We can consider:\n\n            For each suit, we look at the set of numbers we have in that suit.\n\n            Then, we can iterate over the possible sequences (from 1 to 9) and check if the sequence is missing one tile (and that tile is not already present, or we have duplicates that allow using one occurrence of a tile for two sequences? Actually, we can only use one tile once.\n\n            Alternatively, we can think: for each suit, we have a multiset of numbers. Then, we can sort the distinct numbers and check for consecutive triplets.\n\n            However, note: we can use the same tile only once. So if we have two 1m, then we can use one 1m for the sequence [0,1,2] (which is invalid because 0 doesn't exist) or [1,2,3]? Actually, we need three consecutive. The sequence must be three distinct numbers.\n\n            So for a given suit, we can have:\n\n                Let S be the sorted list of distinct numbers (without duplicates) in that suit.\n\n                But wait, duplicates might help: we can use the same number only once. However, having duplicates might allow forming two sequences? But we only need one.\n\n            Actually, we are going to consider: what sequences (of three consecutive numbers) can we form in a suit? We need to check if the set of numbers we have (with multiplicities) can cover two of the three consecutive numbers, and the third is missing.\n\n            However, note: we have three tiles. It is possible that the same suit has two tiles, and the third tile is in another suit. So we must consider each suit independently.\n\n            Steps for shuntsu check with one draw:\n\n            For each suit (m, p, s):\n\n                Let L be the list of numbers (integers) for that suit (only the ones that are in the suit).\n\n                Then, we consider the distinct numbers and their counts. But we cannot use the same tile twice.\n\n                We can also consider: we have up to three tiles in this suit (since total three tiles, but maybe fewer in this suit).\n\n                Possibilities:\n\n                    - If there are three tiles in the same suit, then we can check if they form a shuntsu (sorted and consecutive) -> then we already have it (so we wouldn't be in the case of needing one draw, because we already have a mentsu).\n\n                    - Otherwise, we have less than three tiles in this suit.\n\n                Actually, if we have two tiles in the same suit, then we can try to form a sequence by drawing the third. But the two tiles might be consecutive or not.\n\n                Example: \n                    Tiles: ['1m','2m','3p'] -> in suit 'm', we have [1,2]. Then we can draw 3m to form [1,2,3]m.\n\n                    Example: ['1m','3m','5m'] -> no two consecutive, so we cannot form a sequence with one draw.\n\n                    Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> in suit 'm', we have [1,2] (with two 1s). Then we can draw 0m (which doesn't exist) or 3m. So we can only form [1,2,3] if we draw 3m.\n\n                    Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> we have two tiles in suit 'm': [1,2,4]. Then we can form two sequences: [1,2,3] (by drawing 3m) or [2,3,4] (by drawing 3m). So one draw.\n\n                    Example: ['1m','1m','1m'] -> already a koutsu, so we don't get here.\n\n                So algorithm for shuntsu in one draw for a suit:\n\n                    Let the suit have n tiles (n=0,1,2, or 3). But note: we are in the case where we don't have a mentsu (so no koutsu and no shuntsu). And we are checking for one draw.\n\n                    We need to check for each suit that has at least two tiles (because we need two to form part of a sequence). Then, we look for a gap of one in the consecutive numbers.\n\n                    However, we have to account for duplicates. We can use at most one occurrence per number.\n\n                    Steps:\n\n                      Let A = sorted(set(numbers in this suit))? But we have duplicates. Actually, we need to know the available distinct numbers and their counts, but we can use each tile only once.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n                      We have a multiset of numbers for the suit. We can try to form a sequence (x, x+1, x+2) for x from 1 to 7 (since 8,9,10: 10 doesn't exist).\n\n                      For a fixed x, we need to have at least one tile with number x, one with x+1, and one with x+2.\n\n                      But wait: we can use the same tile for two purposes? No.\n\n                    However, note: we are allowed to draw one tile. So we can cover one missing number.\n\n                    So for a fixed x, we require:\n\n                        We have at least one tile with x or x+1 or x+2 missing, and we can draw that one.\n\n                    But we have three tiles in total, and they are distributed arbitrarily.\n\n                    Actually, we can have:\n\n                      We have two tiles in the suit: then we are missing one number. We can check if the two tiles are two consecutive numbers? Not necessarily: they could be [1,3] then we can draw 2. Or [1,4] then we cannot form a sequence with one draw.\n\n                    Actually, the condition for a suit with two tiles (a and b) is: \n\n                      There exists an integer x such that {a, b} ∩ {x, x+1, x+2} contains two distinct numbers, and the third (the missing one) is not in the set (unless we have duplicates, but we only have two distinct tiles? Actually, we might have two of the same, then we have [a,a] and we are missing two numbers. Then we cannot form a sequence with one draw.\n\n                    But wait: two same tiles: [a, a] -> then we have two a's. Then we can form a sequence only if a-1, a, a+1 or a, a+1, a+2? Actually, no, because we need three consecutive. With two same tiles we cannot form a sequence (we need three distinct consecutive). So two same tiles in the same suit does not help for a shuntsu with one draw.\n\n                    Therefore, for a suit with two tiles:\n\n                      The two tiles must be two distinct numbers (say a and b). Then, we can form a sequence if the set {a, a+1, a+2} or {b-2, b-1, b} or ... etc. Actually, we can check: the three consecutive numbers must include both a and b.\n\n                      Alternatively, we can check: the two numbers must be within a span of 2. Because the maximum gap between two numbers for being part of a three-consecutive set is 2 (like 1 and 3: then we need 2; 1 and 2: then we need 3 or 0, but 0 is invalid so we need 3? Actually, if we have 1 and 2, we can complete to 1,2,3 (draw 3) OR we can complete to 0,1,2 (invalid). So we can only complete to 1,2,3.\n\n                      Similarly, if we have 2 and 3, we can complete to 2,3,4.\n\n                      But if we have 1 and 3, we can complete to 1,2,3 (draw 2) OR 0,1,2 (invalid) OR 2,3,4 (but we don't have 4) -> so only 1,2,3.\n\n                      So the condition for two distinct numbers (a, b) is: the absolute difference |a-b| <= 2, and the set {a, b} must be two of the three consecutive numbers (so the smallest and largest of a,b must be at most 2 apart, and then the missing number is the one in the middle or one of the ends if the set is two consecutive numbers?).\n\n                    Actually, let min_val = min(a,b), max_val = max(a,b)\n\n                    Then the three consecutive numbers must be [min_val, min_val+1, min_val+2] or [max_val-2, max_val-1, max_val] (but these are the same if min_val+2 == max_val?).\n\n                    Conditions:\n\n                      - If the two numbers are consecutive (min_val+1 == max_val): then we can form two sequences: [min_val, min_val+1, min_val+2] (if min_val+2<=9) OR [min_val-1, min_val, min_val+1] (if min_val-1>=1). But note: we have only two tiles, so we need to draw one of the two possibilities. So if either min_val-1 exists (>=1) or min_val+2 exists (<=9), then we can form a sequence.\n\n                      Example: [1,2]: \n                          Sequence1: [0,1,2] -> invalid because 0.\n                          Sequence2: [1,2,3] -> valid (if 3<=9). So we can form [1,2,3] by drawing 3.\n\n                      Example: [2,3]:\n                          Sequence1: [1,2,3] -> valid (if 1>=1) -> yes, so draw 1.\n                          Sequence2: [2,3,4] -> valid (if 4<=9) -> yes, so we can draw 1 or 4. But we only need one.\n\n                      Example: [1,3]:\n                          The two numbers are 1 and 3. The consecutive sets that include both are [1,2,3] (we are missing 2). Also, [0,1,2] (doesn't contain 3) and [1,2,3] is the only one. So we can draw 2.\n\n                      Example: [2,4]:\n                          Consecutive sets: [2,3,4] (we have 2 and 4, missing 3). But also [1,2,3] (has 2, but not 1 and 3? we don't have 1 and 3) and [3,4,5] (has 4, but we don't have 3 and 5). So only [2,3,4] is the one that contains both 2 and 4. So we can draw 3.\n\n                      Example: [1,4]: \n                          The consecutive sets: \n                            [1,2,3] -> contains 1, missing 2,3 -> but we have 4 which is not in this set, so we can't use 4 here.\n                            [2,3,4] -> contains 4, and we have 1 which is not in this set? Actually, we need to use the two tiles we have. But note: we have two tiles (1 and 4). We cannot use the same tile twice. So we must use one tile for one set and the other for another? But we are forming one mentsu. So we are going to use three tiles (the drawn one and two from our hand). But we have two in the suit, so we use both and the drawn one. The drawn one must complete the sequence that includes both 1 and 4? There's no three consecutive that includes both 1 and 4 (the gap is 3, so we need four numbers: 1,2,3,4, but we need only three). So [1,4] cannot form a sequence with one draw.\n\n                    Therefore, the condition for two distinct numbers (a, b) in the same suit is:\n\n                      Let low = min(a, b), high = max(a, b)\n                      Then the set of three consecutive numbers must be [low, low+1, low+2] OR [high-2, high-1, high] (which is the same as [low, low+1, low+2] if high==low+2, but if high>low+2, then we have two possibilities: [low, low+1, low+2] and [high-2, high-1, high] and possibly others in between? Actually, we can also consider the entire range from low to high, but we require consecutive.\n\n                    Actually, we can check: the two numbers must be contained in some three consecutive numbers. The three consecutive numbers must cover the entire range from low to high (so high - low <= 2) and then we can fill the missing one.\n\n                    So condition: high - low <= 2.\n\n                    Then, the missing number is:\n\n                      In the set {low, low+1, low+2} (if we use the lower bound as the start) we are missing one number. Similarly, if we use the higher bound, we might get the same.\n\n                    But note: the three consecutive set must be contiguous. So if we have two numbers, say [a, b] (a<b), then the three consecutive set must start at a or end at b, or somewhere in the middle.\n\n                    Actually, the three consecutive set must be [x, x+1, x+2] such that x <= a and b <= x+2.\n\n                    Then, the condition is: a <= x and x+2 >= b, and the set [x,x+1,x+2] must contain both a and b.\n\n                    The minimal x is a-2 (so that x+2 >= a) and the maximal x is b-2 (so that x <= b). But we require x <= a and x+2>=b -> so x must be at least b-2 and at most a.\n\n                    Then, we require: b-2 <= a.\n\n                    Which is the same as: a >= b-2, i.e., the gap is at most 2.\n\n                    Then, the missing number is the one that is not a or b in the set [x, x+1, x+2]. But note: we are allowed to draw that missing number.\n\n                    However, we must ensure that the missing number is between 1 and 9.\n\n                    Example: [1,3]: \n                        Then we require x such that x<=1 and x+2>=3 -> x>=1 (from x<=1 and x>=1) -> x=1. Then the set is [1,2,3]. Missing number is 2.\n\n                    Example: [2,4]:\n                        Then we require x<=2 and x+2>=4 -> x>=2. So x=2. Then the set is [2,3,4]. Missing number is 3.\n\n                    Example: [1,2]:\n                        Then x<=1 and x+2>=2 -> x>=0. But x must be at least 1 (since numbers start at 1). Then x=1 -> set [1,2,3]. Missing number 3.\n\n                    Example: [2,3]:\n                        Then x<=2 and x+2>=3 -> x>=1. So x can be 1 or 2.\n                        If x=1: set [1,2,3] -> we have 2,3 so missing 1.\n                        If x=2: set [2,3,4] -> missing 4.\n\n                    So we can form a sequence by drawing either 1 or 4.\n\n                    But note: we are only drawing one tile, so we can choose any one. So the existence of at least one x (in the range [max(1, b-2), min(a, 9-2)]?) Actually, the condition is just that the gap is <=2, and the set [x, x+1, x+2] must have the missing number in [1,9].\n\n                    However, we must check that the missing number is between 1 and 9. But if the set [x,x+1,x+2] is defined by the two numbers, then x is chosen such that x<=a and x+2>=b. The missing number is one of x, x+1, x+2, so we must check that the entire set [x,x+1,x+2] is within [1,9]?\n\n                    Actually, the problem allows numbers from 1 to 9. So the set [x,x+1,x+2] must be entirely in [1,9]. But note: if we have [8,9] (gap=1) then we can form [8,9,10] -> but 10 is invalid. So we must ensure that x+2<=9.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can iterate over the possible starting points for the sequence? But note: the two numbers are fixed, so we can compute the required x.\n\n                    Actually, we can do:\n\n                      Let low = min(a,b), high = max(a,b)\n\n                      Then the necessary condition is: high - low <= 2.\n\n                      And the sequence must be entirely in [1,9]. The sequence that covers [low, high] is [low, low+1, low+2] (if high==low+2) OR [high-2, high-1, high] (if high==low+2, same) OR if high==low+1, then we can have two sequences: [low, low+1, low+2] and [low-1, low, low+1] (if low-1>=1) and [high-2, high-1, high] (if high-2>=1) but actually [high-2, high-1, high] is the same as [low-1, low, low+1] when high=low+1? Let me check: if low=2, high=3, then [2,3,4] and [1,2,3] (if we use [low-1, low, high] then [1,2,3] is the same as [high-2, high-1, high] because high=3, so [1,2,3]).\n\n                    So we can simply:\n\n                      If high - low <= 2 and the entire set [min_value, max_value] is contained in [1,9] (which they are) but the sequence must not go out of bounds.\n\n                    Actually, the sequence [x, x+1, x+2] must have x>=1 and x+2<=9.\n\n                    Then, the missing number is the one that is not in {a,b}. And we must check that the missing number is between 1 and 9 (which it is, because the set [x,x+1,x+2] is entirely in [1,9]).\n\n                    But note: we are drawing one tile, so we can draw the missing number.\n\n                    However, what if the two numbers are [1,3] and the sequence [1,2,3] is valid (1 and 3 are in [1,9] and 2 is too). Similarly, [8,9]: then the sequence [8,9,10] is invalid because 10. So we must check the entire set [x,x+1,x+2] is in [1,9].\n\n                    Therefore, the conditions for a suit with two distinct tiles (a,b) is:\n\n                      Let low = min(a,b), high = max(a,b)\n                      Condition1: high - low <= 2\n                      Condition2: There exists an integer x (the start of the sequence) such that:\n                          x <= low and x+2 >= high and x>=1 and x+2<=9.\n\n                    But note: the sequence that covers both is uniquely determined? Actually, we can take x = low (then the sequence is [low, low+1, low+2]), and then we require low+2>=high (which is true because high<=low+2) and low>=1 (true) and low+2<=9 (so low<=7). Similarly, we can take x = high-2 (then the sequence is [high-2, high-1, high]), and then we require high-2>=1 (so high>=3) and high<=9 (true). \n\n                    Actually, we can use the same sequence for both representations. The condition for the sequence to be valid is that the entire set [x,x+1,x+2] is in [1,9] and contains both a and b.\n\n                    We can set x = low (then the set is [low, low+1, low+2]). Then we require low+2<=9 (so that the set is valid) and high<=low+2 (which is given). Then the missing number is the one that is not a or b in the set.\n\n                    Alternatively, we can set x = high-2, then the set is [high-2, high-1, high]. Then we require high-2>=1 (so that the set is valid) and low>=high-2 (which is given because low<=high and high-low<=2).\n\n                    But note: we don't need to check both. We just need to know if there exists at least one sequence (any) that uses both a and b and is entirely in [1,9]. The condition is:\n\n                      The set [min_value, max_value] is contained in an interval of length 2 (so consecutive numbers) and the entire set [x, x+2] (with x chosen appropriately) is within [1,9].\n\n                    Actually, we can check:\n\n                      Let the two numbers be a and b (sorted: a<=b). Then the three consecutive set must be [a, a+1, a+2] (if b==a+2) OR [a, a+1, a+2] (if b==a+1, then we can use [a, a+1, a+2] OR [a-1, a, a+1] if a-1>=1). Similarly, if b==a (duplicate) then we cannot form a sequence (as discussed).\n\n                    Alternatively, we can iterate over the possible sequences that include both a and b. The sequences that include a and b are the ones that start at max(1, a-2) and go to min(7, a) [but wait, we can also consider the entire range from 1 to 7 for the start of the sequence?]\n\n                    Actually, we can do:\n\n                      For x in range(1, 8): # because x+2<=9 => x<=7\n                          if a in [x, x+1, x+2] and b in [x, x+1, x+2]:\n                              then we can form the sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n                    But note: we have two distinct tiles (so a != b). And the set [x,x+1,x+2] must contain both a and b.\n\n                    Then, we iterate x from 1 to 7, and check if both a and b are in [x, x+1, x+2]. Then we can draw the third.\n\n                    But note: the two tiles are in the same suit. And we are only concerned with the suit.\n\n                    However, we are in the context of one draw for the entire hand. We can also consider that we might have more than two tiles in the same suit? Actually, we have three tiles in total, so the same suit can have at most three tiles.\n\n                    But wait: if we have three tiles in the same suit, then we might have a koutsu (triplet) or a shuntsu (sequence). However, we are already checking for koutsu (if any tile appears three times, then we have a koutsu). And for shuntsu, we check if the three tiles form a sequence. But if we have three tiles, we might have duplicates.\n\n                    Actually, we are in the case where we don't have a mentsu. So we don't have a triplet and we don't have a sequence.\n\n                    Now, if we have three tiles in the same suit, then we don't have a mentsu, so they must not form a triplet and not form a sequence.\n\n                    Then, we can consider:\n\n                      Case: three tiles in the same suit (all three) and they are not a triplet and not a sequence.\n\n                      Then, we can complete a triplet by drawing one more (if we have a pair) OR we can complete a sequence by drawing one (if two of them form a consecutive pair with a gap of at most 2, and the entire sequence is within 1..9).\n\n                    Actually, if we have three tiles in the same suit, we can also use two of them to form part of a sequence and the third is redundant. But note: we are allowed to use any three tiles (so we can drop one). But wait, the problem is: we need at least one mentsu in the hand. After drawing one tile, we have four tiles. Then we can form a mentsu by selecting three of the four.\n\n                    However, the problem does not require that the entire hand is a mentsu, just that there exists one.\n\n                    So for three tiles in the same suit (all three) and they don't form a mentsu, we can consider:\n\n                      Possibility 1: They are three distinct numbers. Then we can check if they form a sequence (then we already have it, so we wouldn't be here). Or if not, can we complete a sequence by drawing one? \n\n                      Example: [1,2,4] -> we can draw 3 to complete [1,2,3] or [2,3,4]. So one draw.\n\n                      Example: [1,3,4] -> we can draw 2 to complete [1,2,3] (which uses 1,3,4? no, because 1,2,3 uses 1,2,3, and we have 1 and 3, so we can use 1,3 and the drawn 2. But wait, we have three tiles: [1,3,4]. Then the set [1,2,3] requires 2, and we don't have 2. But we have 4, which is not used. Then we can form [1,2,3] by drawing 2, and ignore 4. Similarly, [2,3,4] would require 2, but we don't have 2.\n\n                      But wait, we have [1,3,4]. We can form [3,4,?] -> we need 5 for [3,4,5] (if we draw 5) OR [2,3,4] (if we draw 2). So two possibilities.\n\n                      However, we are checking for one draw. So we can draw either 2 or 5 to form a sequence.\n\n                      But note: the problem asks for the minimum number of draws. So if we can form a mentsu with one draw, then we output 1.\n\n                    Therefore, we must consider:\n\n                      We have three tiles. We might have:\n\n                        0, 1, 2, or 3 tiles in a suit.\n\n                    We can break the three tiles by suit:\n\n                      Let hand = [t1, t2, t3] (each tile is a string of two chars)\n\n                      Group by suit: count the frequency per suit.\n\n                    Then, we can check:\n\n                      Case 1: Already a mentsu (0 draws)\n\n                      Case 2: One draw:\n\n                          - There is a pair (two same tiles) in any suit: then drawing one more of that tile forms a triplet.\n\n                          - Or, there is a suit with two distinct tiles (a,b) such that the gap is <=2 and the entire set [x,x+1,x+2] is in [1,9] (for some x) and the missing number is in [1,9].\n\n                          - Or, there is a suit with three distinct tiles (and they are not consecutive) but we can complete a sequence by drawing one. Actually, wait: if we have three distinct tiles, we can only use two of them for a sequence and the third is extra. But we can form a sequence by drawing one if the two that we use are consecutive (with gap<=2) and the entire set [x,x+1,x+2] is in [1,9].\n\n                      However, we have three tiles, so if we have three in the same suit, then we have three distinct numbers (otherwise, if there's a duplicate, then we have a pair and we can form a triplet by one draw).\n\n                    Actually, we can combine:\n\n                      For one draw, we can do:\n\n                          Option A: Complete a triplet (if there is a tile that appears at least twice)\n\n                          Option B: Complete a sequence (if there exists a suit and two tiles in that suit that are part of a three consecutive set (with gap<=2) and the entire set [x,x+1,x+2] is in [1,9])\n\n                    But note: the two tiles for the sequence might be from two different suits? No, because the sequence must be in the same suit.\n\n                    And the triplet must be in the same suit.\n\n                    Therefore, we can do:\n\n                      Step 1: Check for existing mentsu.\n\n                      Step 2: Check for one draw:\n\n                          Check if there is any tile that appears at least twice -> then we can draw one more to complete triplet.\n\n                          Check for any suit that has at least two distinct tiles (even if they are from three tiles) and the two tiles (or two of the three) form a consecutive set (with gap<=2) and the entire set [x,x+1,x+2] is in [1,9] (i.e., x>=1 and x+2<=9). But note: we might have three tiles in the same suit, then we have three distinct numbers. Then we can check for any two of them (or all three) to form a consecutive set.\n\n                    However, we can simplify the sequence check:\n\n                      We are going to check for every suit that has at least two tiles (distinct or not) but note: duplicates don't help for a sequence (because we need three distinct consecutive). So we must consider distinct numbers.\n\n                      For a given suit, let S be the set of distinct numbers (ignore duplicates). Then, we want to know: is there a three consecutive numbers [x,x+1,x+2] such that at least two of them are in S? (But wait, we need to form a sequence of three, so we need all three. However, we are allowed to draw one, so we need two of the three and the third is missing.)\n\n                      Actually, we need to check: for the set S (the distinct numbers in the suit), and for each x in [1,7] (so that the sequence [x,x+1,x+2] is valid), we check if the set [x,x+1,x+2] has at least two elements in common with S (because we can use two from our hand and draw the third). But wait, we might have more than two? Then we don't need to draw that one? Actually, no: we are drawing one tile to complete the sequence.\n\n                      However, note: we have three tiles. We might have two tiles that are x and x+1, then we draw x+2. Or two tiles that are x and x+2, then we draw x+1. Or two tiles that are x+1 and x+2, then we draw x.\n\n                      But we don't care about the third tile (if any) in the suit. We only care about having two of the three.\n\n                    Therefore, for a suit, we can check:\n\n                      For x from 1 to 7:\n                          Let T = {x, x+1, x+2}\n                          If |S ∩ T| >= 2, then we can form the sequence by drawing the missing tile (if the missing tile is in [1,9], which it is by definition of T).\n\n                    But note: we are only concerned with the two tiles we have. We don't require the entire set T to be in the suit, only two of them.\n\n                    However, we must also consider that we have three tiles. The other tile (if present) might be in the same suit and might be one of the numbers in T, then we have three numbers (so we have two or three of T). But we only need two.\n\n                    Example: [1,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the current hand already contains a mentsu. A mentsu can be either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit (e.g., 1m, 2m, 3m).\n\n2. **Check for One Draw**: If no mentsu is present, we then check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. This can happen in two ways:\n   - **Completing a Triplet**: If there are at least two identical tiles, drawing one more of the same tile completes the triplet.\n   - **Completing a Sequence**: If there exists a suit with at least two distinct tiles that can form part of a sequence (i.e., their numbers differ by at most 2), then drawing the missing tile completes the sequence.\n\n3. **Check for Two Draws**: If neither of the above conditions is met, then drawing two tiles is required. This could involve:\n   - **Two Pairs**: Drawing one tile to complete each of two different pairs (though this scenario is less common and might require further analysis).\n   - **Other Combinations**: Drawing two tiles to form either a triplet or a sequence from scratch or by completing two separate pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = [t for t in data[0].split(',') if t] + [t for t in data[1].split(',') if t] + [t for t in data[2].split(',') if t]\n    \n    suits = {'m', 'p', 's'}\n    count_by_tile = {}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        if tile not in count_by_tile:\n            count_by_tile[tile] = 0\n        count_by_tile[tile] += 1\n\n    has_koutsu = any(count >= 3 for count in count_by_tile.values())\n    \n    suits_dict = {suit: [] for suit in suits}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        suit = tile[1]\n        suits_dict[suit].append(num)\n        \n    has_shuntsu = False\n    for suit, nums in suits_dict.items():\n        if len(nums) < 3:\n            continue\n        distinct_nums = set(nums)\n        sorted_nums = sorted(distinct_nums)\n        n = len(sorted_nums)\n        for i in range(n - 2):\n            if sorted_nums[i+1] == sorted_nums[i] + 1 and sorted_nums[i+2] == sorted_nums[i] + 2:\n                has_shuntsu = True\n                break\n        if has_shuntsu:\n            break\n            \n    if has_koutsu or has_shuntsu:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    count_by_suit = {}\n    for suit in suits:\n        count_by_suit[suit] = len(suits_dict.get(suit, []))\n        \n    has_pair = any(count >= 2 for count in count_by_tile.values())\n    if has_pair:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    for suit, nums_list in suits_dict.items():\n        if len(nums_list) < 2:\n            continue\n        distinct_nums = set(nums_list)\n        for x in range(1, 8):\n            seq = {x, x+1, x+2}\n            if len(seq.intersection(distinct_nums)) >= 2:\n                print(1)\n                return\n                \n    print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into individual tiles. The tiles are processed to count occurrences of each tile and group them by suit.\n2. **Koutsu Check**: The code checks if any tile appears at least three times, indicating a triplet (koutsu) is already present.\n3. **Shuntsu Check**: For each suit, the code checks if there are three consecutive numbers (e.g., 1,2,3) in the same suit, forming a sequence (shuntsu).\n4. **One Draw Check**: If no mentsu is found, the code checks if drawing one tile can complete a triplet (by having at least two identical tiles) or a sequence (by having two tiles in the same suit with numbers differing by at most 2).\n5. **Two Draws Default**: If none of the above conditions are met, the solution defaults to requiring two draws, as it's the minimum number needed to form a mentsu in the remaining scenarios.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu with minimal draws, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum input size.",
