After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read the first line to get n and m.\n Then, we read the next n lines, each containing a string of m digits.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We need to know for each subject, what is the maximum mark? (since best means highest mark)\n 2. However, note: there might be multiple students with the same highest mark in a subject. But the problem says: \n    \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student who got a higher mark\". So if two students have the same highest mark, then they are both best at that subject.\n\n 3. For a student to be successful, there must exist at least one subject in which he is the best.\n\n Approach:\n Let's create a list `students` where each element is a string (or list of characters) of length m.\n\n We can do:\n   - For each subject j, find the maximum mark (character) in that column.\n   - Then, for each student i, check for at least one subject j such that the student's mark in j is equal to the maximum mark for j.\n\n However, note: if we have two students with the same highest mark, then they are both best in that subject.\n\n But wait: the problem does not require a unique best. It just requires that there is no one with a higher mark. So having the same highest mark doesn't disqualify.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   For subject 0: max is '3' -> from the first row: '2', second row: '2', third row: '1' -> so only the first row has '2'? Actually wait:\n\n   Actually, let me break down the example:\n\n   The input is given as:\n        n=3, m=3\n        Row0: \"223\"\n        Row1: \"232\"\n        Row2: \"112\"\n\n   So the columns are:\n        col0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n        col1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n        col2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n   Now, for each student:\n        Student0: [2,2,3] -> Check each subject:\n            Subject0: 2 == max0 (which is '2') -> yes, so best in subject0? Actually, note: the problem says \"best\" meaning no one has a higher mark. \n                    But here, student0 and student1 both have 2 in subject0. However, note: the condition is \"no student has a higher mark\", so 2 is the highest (since 3 is higher but in different subject). \n                    But wait: in subject0, the highest mark is 2. There is no mark greater than 2. So both student0 and student1 are best in subject0.\n\n        However, the sample output is 2 successful students. \n\n        Let's check the sample output: \n            Student0 is successful because he is best in subject0 and also subject2? \n                subject0: yes (because 2 is the highest)\n                subject1: his mark is 2, but the highest is 3 -> not best\n                subject2: his mark is 3, which is the highest -> so best in subject2.\n\n            So student0 is successful because he is best in at least one subject.\n\n            Student1: \n                subject0: 2 (same as max) -> best\n                subject1: 3 (same as max) -> best\n                subject2: 2 (max is 3) -> not best.\n            So student1 is successful.\n\n            Student2:\n                subject0: 1 < 2 -> not best\n                subject1: 1 < 3 -> not best\n                subject2: 2 < 3 -> not best\n            So student2 fails.\n\n        Therefore, we count student0 and student1.\n\n        But wait: our example above for student0: we said he is best in subject0 and subject2. That's two. But note: being best in one is enough.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"successful if there exists a subject he is the best at\". So we only need one.\n\n        How to determine for a student i and subject j: \n            student[i][j] == max_mark[j]   --> then he is best in subject j.\n\n        But note: if the max_mark[j] is achieved by multiple students, then all those students are best in subject j.\n\n        So algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Read n and m.\n        Step 2: Read the n lines.\n\n        Step 3: For each subject j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum character in that column.\n\n        Step 4: For each student i, check for any subject j (0 to m-1) such that the mark of student i in subject j equals the max_mark[j]. \n                If at least one such j exists, then student i is successful.\n\n        Step 5: Count the number of successful students.\n\n Example 2: \n        Input: \n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Let's break it down:\n\n        Columns:\n            col0: ['9','1','1'] -> max='9'\n            col1: ['1','1','1'] -> max='1'\n            col2: ['7','8','1'] -> max='8'\n            col3: ['2','2','1'] -> max='2'\n            col4: ['8','8','1'] -> max='8'\n\n        Now, for each student:\n\n        Student0: \"91728\"\n            col0: '9' == '9' -> best in col0 -> successful.\n\n        Student1: \"11828\"\n            col0: '1' != '9'\n            col1: '1' == '1' -> best in col1 -> successful.\n\n        Student2: \"11111\"\n            col0: '1' != '9'\n            col1: '1' == '1' -> best in col1 -> successful.\n\n        So answer is 3.\n\n Implementation:\n\n        We can store the marks as a list of strings.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        gradebook = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n            gradebook.append(s)\n\n        # Precompute the maximum for each subject (each column)\n        # Since m is the number of subjects, and n the number of students.\n        max_marks = [0] * m   # We'll make a list of m elements, initially zeros but we want to compare characters.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        max_marks = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = [gradebook[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_col = max(col)   # This works because the characters '1' to '9' are lex order same as numeric order.\n            max_marks.append(max_col)\n\n        Then, for each student i, we look at each subject j: if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j], then we break out (or set a flag) and count this student.\n\n        However, note: we don't need to break the entire outer loop, but we can check for each student until we find one subject where the condition holds.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            successful = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    successful = True\n                    break\n            if successful:\n                count += 1\n\n        Print(count)\n\n Let's test with the first example:\n\n        gradebook = [\"223\", \"232\", \"112\"]\n        m=3, so max_marks for:\n            j0: ['2','2','1'] -> max is '2'\n            j1: ['2','3','1'] -> max is '3'\n            j2: ['3','2','2'] -> max is '3'\n\n        Student0: \"223\"\n            j0: '2' == '2' -> True -> successful.\n\n        Student1: \"232\"\n            j0: '2'=='2' -> True -> successful.\n\n        Student2: \"112\"\n            j0: '1' != '2'\n            j1: '1' != '3'\n            j2: '2' != '3' -> not successful.\n\n        So count=2 -> correct.\n\n        Second example: \n            gradebook = [\"91728\", \"11828\", \"11111\"]\n            max_marks: \n                j0: ['9','1','1'] -> '9'\n                j1: ['1','1','1'] -> '1'\n                j2: ['7','8','1'] -> '8'\n                j3: ['2','2','1'] -> '2'\n                j4: ['8','8','1'] -> '8'\n\n            Student0: \"91728\"\n                j0: '9'=='9' -> True -> successful.\n\n            Student1: \"11828\"\n                j0: '1' != '9'\n                j1: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful.\n\n            Student2: \"11111\"\n                j0: '1' != '9'\n                j1: '1'=='1' -> True -> successful.\n\n        Count=3 -> correct.\n\n        Edge cases: \n          n=1, m=1: \n            Input: \"1 1\\n5\"\n            Then: max_marks[0] = '5'\n            Student0: '5'=='5' -> successful -> count=1.\n\n          n=1, m=0: \n            Then we read one line with 0 characters. Then max_marks would be an empty list, and the student would not have any subject -> not successful. \n            But the problem states: \"each student got a mark from 1 to 9 for each subject\", but m>=1 according to constraints (n,m>=1).\n\n        According to constraints, n, m are at least 1.\n\n        We assume input as described.\n\n        Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        gradebook = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            line = input().strip()\n            gradebook.append(line)\n\n        # If there are no students, then n=0, but n>=1 so skip.\n\n        max_marks = [0]*m   # We'll use list of characters, but we can do with max per column.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can do without storing the whole column if we want to save memory, but n, m <=100 so it's okay.\n\n        for j in range(m):\n            col = []\n            for i in range(n):\n                col.append(gradebook[i][j])\n            max_marks[j] = max(col)   # max of a list of single-digit strings\n\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Check if student i is successful\n            found = False\n            for j in range(m):\n                if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n            if found:\n                count += 1\n\n        print(count)\n\n Let me run the provided examples.\n\n However, note: the input example is given as a string that includes the newline. We are using .strip() so that should remove any extra spaces or newlines.\n\n But the problem says: the first line contains two integers, then n lines each containing m characters.\n\n We are reading exactly n lines.\n\n We can also use:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n        gradebook = data[1:1+n]\n\n But the problem says to read from stdin, and the input format is as described.\n\n Let's write accordingly.\n\n But note: the example input is given as:\n        ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n However, in standard input, we don't get a list. We get the input as is.\n\n But the example input is provided as a string that includes the newlines.\n\n Since the problem says \"The first input line ...\", then we read the first line and then the next n lines.\n\n We are doing:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\n        Then we read n lines.\n\n This is standard.\n\n I think we are good.\n\n Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        Output: 2\n\n Example 2:\n        Input:\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Output: 3\n\n We'll submit the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the input may be provided in a single line for the first part? But the example input is given as a string that includes the entire input. \n\n In competitive programming, we read from stdin line by line.\n\n Since the problem states the first line has two integers and then n lines, we are safe.\n\n Code:\n\n Note: We are using the fact that the characters are digits and the max function on a list of single-digit strings will work because '1'<'2'<...<'9'. \n\n But if we had negative numbers or other characters, we cannot rely on lex order. However, the problem says marks from 1 to 9.\n\n So we are safe.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing a gradebook where each student's marks across multiple subjects are given. For each subject, we need to find the highest mark achieved by any student. A student is successful if they have the highest mark in at least one subject.\n2. **Intuition**: For each subject, identify the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If they do, they are marked as successful.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Read the input values, which include the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook entries.\n   - For each subject, compute the maximum mark across all students.\n   - For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If yes, count them as successful.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves two main steps: computing maximum marks for each subject (O(n*m)) and checking each student against these maxima (O(n*m)). Thus, the overall complexity is O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    n, m = map(int, data[0].split())\n    gradebook = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        line = data[i].strip()\n        gradebook.append(line)\n        \n    max_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            col.append(gradebook[i][j])\n        max_marks[j] = max(col)\n        \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        found = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first line contains the number of students (n) and subjects (m). Subsequent lines contain the gradebook entries.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by examining all student entries in that column.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: Each student is checked against the maximum marks of each subject. If a student has the highest mark in any subject, they are counted as successful.\n4. **Output**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input and checks each student's performance against the highest marks in each subject, ensuring accurate results with optimal performance.",
