He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n We are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. \n   - a is an integer base (2 <= a <= 25)\n   - b can be either an integer (same constraints) or the letter 'R'\n\n Then we are given a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (with possible leading zeros, but length <= 1000). The number is guaranteed to be representable.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Convert the given string c (which is in base a) to an integer in base 10.\n    Since the base a can be up to 25, and the string can have digits and letters (from 'A' onward for digits above 9), note:\n        - Digits in base a: from '0' to '9' and then letters from 'A' to ... until the base-1 digit representation.\n        - However, note that the input string c is given in base a, so each character must be in the range [0, a-1]. \n        - But wait: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0\", and for other cases the number isn't too big.\n\n 2. If b is an integer (so not 'R'):\n      Convert the base-10 integer we just got to base b, with the same rules: digits from 0 to b-1. For digits above 9, use letters starting from 'A' for 10, then 'B' for 11, etc.\n\n 3. If b is 'R':\n      Convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral. Note: the problem states that the number is at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n However, note the example: \n      Input: \"5 R\\n4\" -> Output: \"IV\"\n\n But also note: \n      Input: \"10 2\\n1\" -> Output: \"1\"\n      Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> Output: \"V\"\n\n Important: The input c is given in base a, so we must first convert from base a to base 10.\n\n Steps for converting from base a to base 10:\n\n   We are given a string `c_str` and base `a`.\n   We can do: \n        num = 0\n        for each char in c_str:\n            d = int(char) if char is a digit from '0' to '9', but note: the string might have letters for bases above 10?\n        However, the problem says: \"each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty.\"\n\n   But note: the input c is a non-negative integer in base a. The representation of c in base a uses digits from 0 to a-1.\n\n   How to map characters to digits?\n        - If the character is between '0' and '9' and the digit value is less than a, then that's fine.\n        - But what if the base is 11? Then we might have a digit 'A' (which is 10) and that is valid.\n\n   However, note the input string may contain leading zeros, but the length is up to 1000.\n\n   Steps for base a to base 10 conversion:\n\n        Let `digits` be a dictionary or mapping from character to integer, but note: the input string might use digits and then letters for digits >=10.\n\n        Alternatively, we can convert each character to a digit value:\n\n          For a character `ch`:\n            if '0' <= ch <= '9': then digit = ord(ch) - ord('0')\n            else: digit = ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        But wait: is this always true? The problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" \n\n        However, we must ensure that the digit value is less than the base a. The problem guarantees that the number is in base a, so every character should represent a digit in [0, a-1].\n\n        Example: base 11, then digits can be 0-10, so we see 'A' (which is 10) and that's okay.\n\n        But note: the input might have a digit that is represented by a letter even if the base is <=10? The problem says: \"The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\". So the digits must be in the set {0,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, which could either be a standard base or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves three main steps: converting the input number from its given base to base 10, then converting it to the desired output base (either standard or Roman numerals).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input String to Base 10**: The input string is given in base `a`. Each character in the string represents a digit in base `a`. We convert each character to its corresponding numerical value and compute the total value in base 10.\n2. **Convert Base 10 to Output Base**:\n   - **Standard Base**: If the target base `b` is an integer, we convert the base 10 number to base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. Digits greater than 9 are represented by letters starting from 'A'.\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', we convert the base 10 number to Roman numerals using predefined values for thousands, hundreds, tens, and units. Special cases for numbers like 4 and 9 are handled using subtractive notation.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the input number is zero or very large, ensuring correct conversion without leading zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n\n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid base a\")\n        return\n        \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        b = 'R'\n    else:\n        try:\n            b = int(b_str)\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid base b\")\n            return\n\n    c_str = data[1].strip()\n\n    n = 0\n    negative = False\n    if c_str.startswith('-'):\n        negative = True\n        c_str = c_str[1:]\n    if not c_str:\n        num_base10 = 0\n    else:\n        valid_chars = set()\n        for char in c_str:\n            valid_chars.add(char)\n        \n        digits = []\n        for char in c_str:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                digits.append(d)\n            elif 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n                digits.append(d)\n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid character in input number\")\n                return\n                \n        if any(d >= a for d in digits):\n            print(\"Digit exceeds base a\")\n            return\n            \n        num_base10 = 0\n        power = 1\n        for i in range(len(c_str)-1, -1, -1):\n            digit_val = digits[i]\n            num_base10 += digit_val * power\n            power *= a\n\n    if negative:\n        num_base10 = -num_base10\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        if num_base10 == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n\n        roman_numerals = ''\n        M = [\"\", \"M\"]\n        C = [\"\", \"C\", \"CC\", \"CCC\", \"CD\", \"D\", \"DC\", \"DCC\", \"DCCC\", \"CM\"]\n        X = [\"\", \"X\", \"XX\", \"XXX\", \"XL\", \"L\", \"LX\", \"LXX\", \"LXXX\", \"XC\"]\n        I = [\"\", \"I\", \"II\", \"III\", \"IV\", \"V\", \"VI\", \"VII\", \"VIII\", \"IX\"]\n\n        num = abs(num_base10)\n        roman = ''\n        roman += M[num // 1000] + C[(num % 1000) // 100] + X[(num % 100) // 10] + I[num % 10]\n        roman_numerals = roman\n        print(roman_numerals)\n    else:\n        if num_base10 == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n            return\n\n        base_b = b\n        if base_b < 2 or base_b > 36:\n            print(\"Invalid base b\")\n            return\n\n        digits_list = []\n        num = abs(num_base10)\n        while num:\n            num, r = divmod(num, base_b)\n            if r < 10:\n                digits_list.append(str(r))\n            else:\n                digits_list.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n\n        res = ''.join(digits_list[::-1])\n        if negative:\n            res = '-' + res\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line specifies the source base `a` and the target base `b` (which can be 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line is the number to convert.\n2. **Base Conversion**: The input string is converted from base `a` to base 10 by processing each character, converting it to its numerical value, and accumulating the total value.\n3. **Output Conversion**:\n   - **Standard Base**: The base 10 number is converted to the target base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders. Remainders greater than 9 are converted to letters.\n   - **Roman Numerals**: The base 10 number is split into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units. Each segment is converted to Roman numerals using predefined patterns, handling subtractive notation for numbers like 4 and 9.\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution checks for invalid inputs, zero values, and negative numbers, ensuring correct conversion and formatting.
