При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's analyze the problem:\n\nWe are given a string `t` (which can be up to 100 characters). We want to check if there exists a string `s` such that:\n  t = s + s[overlap:]   for some overlap (with 0 < overlap < len(s))\n\nBut note: \n  - The entire message t must be formed by two consecutive transmissions of `s` with an overlap (at least 1 and at most len(s)-1).\n  - However, if the entire t is just two copies of s without any overlap, then we don't consider that as an error. So we require that the two copies of s are overlapped (so the total length of t is between len(s)+1 and 2*len(s)-1).\n\nBut wait: the example says that if we get \"abcabc\", then there is no error. Why?\n  Because we can break it into two parts: the first part is \"abc\", and the second part is \"abc\". However, note that the second part might have been intended as an overlap? But the problem states: \"The error occurs when two identical messages are sent in a row and they merge by overlapping at the same characters. The length of the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message.\"\n\nHowever, note that the example output for \"abcabc\" is \"NO\".\n\nSo the idea is: \n  We are allowed to have an overlap (so t is formed by two copies of s with an overlap of k, where 0 < k < len(s)), but if t is simply two copies of s without any overlap (i.e., k=0) then that is not considered an error.\n\nBut also note: the problem says \"Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений.\" -> meaning if the entire second message is overlapped (so t is exactly two copies of s with no extra characters) then that is not an error. Actually, the example says: if you get \"abcd\", then no error. And \"abcabc\" is also no error.\n\nWait, how do we interpret \"abcd\"? \n  If we break \"abcd\": \n    We require that t is formed by two copies of s with an overlap. So we need to find an s such that:\n        t = s + s[overlap:]\n    and the overlap is between 1 and len(s)-1.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"If the entire second message is overlapped\" (meaning the whole second message is overlapped) then that is not considered an error. Actually, the condition for error requires that the overlap is strictly less than the length of the message. But note: the overlap must be positive and less than the length of the message. \n\nHowever, note the example: \n  Input: 'abcabc' -> Output: 'NO'\n\nWhy? Because if we try to break it as two copies of \"abc\" with an overlap of 3 (which is the full length of \"abc\"), then that is not allowed (overlap must be less than the length). But wait, there's another possibility: maybe we can break it differently?\n\nActually, note: the problem says the two messages are identical and the error causes a merge by overlapping. The entire message t must be the result of two transmissions. \n\nBut the problem does not say that the two transmissions were of the same string. Wait, the problem says: \"two identical messages\". So the two messages are the same, so we are looking for a string s such that t is formed by s and then s again with an overlap (but the entire second copy is not necessarily used?).\n\nActually, the process: \n  We send two copies of s. Then an error might occur, merging them with an overlap of k (where 0 < k < len(s)). So the resulting string is:\n      s + s[k:]\n\nBut note: the entire string t must be equal to s + s[k:].\n\nAlso, note that the problem says: \"if the obtained message t can be represented in this way, then output YES and one possible s. Otherwise, output NO.\"\n\nBut wait, there's a catch: what if the entire t is just two copies of s without any overlap? That is, k=0? Then we would have t = s + s. But the problem says that the error requires an overlap (so k>=1 and k < len(s)), so k=0 is not an error. Therefore, if t is two copies of s (without any overlap) then that is not an error. But note: what if we break t differently? Maybe we can break t as two copies of a different s?\n\nLet me clarify: \n  We are to determine if there exists ANY string s and an integer k (0 < k < len(s)) such that t = s + s[k:].\n\nHowever, note: the two messages are identical, so both are s.\n\nApproach:\n\nLet n = len(t)\n\nWe are going to consider all possible ways to split t into two parts: \n  Let the first part be of length i (from 1 to n-1) and the second part of length n-i.\n\nBut note: the two parts are two copies of the same string s. However, the first part is the entire first message, and the second part is the second message (which might have been overlapped by k characters). \n\nBut actually, the entire t is built from two copies of s. The first message is s, and the second message is s but we only use the last k characters of the first s and then the remaining s[k:].\n\nAlternatively, we can think: \n  Let s be the first message. Then the second message is s, but we only take the part from index k to the end. So the entire string t is:\n      t = s + s[k:]\n\nAnd the total length of t is: len(s) + (len(s) - k) = 2*len(s) - k.\n\nBut note: k must be between 1 and len(s)-1.\n\nHow can we relate the entire string t to s?\n\nWe know that the beginning of t must be s, and the end of t must be s[k:]. Also, the entire second part (from the second message) must be a suffix of s.\n\nBut also, the entire string t must be consistent: the first len(s) characters of t must be s, and the last (len(s)-k) characters must be the same as the substring of s starting at k.\n\nBut note: the entire second message (the second copy of s) is broken into two parts: the first k characters are merged with the end of the first s, so they are not stored separately. Then the remaining part (from index k to the end of s) is appended.\n\nTherefore, the condition for a candidate s (which has length L) is:\n  - The entire t must be of length 2*L - k, so we have: 2*L - k = n => k = 2*L - n.\n  - Conditions on k: 0 < k < L.\n\nBut also, the string t must satisfy:\n  t[0:L] = s\n  t[L:] = s[k:]   => but note: s[k:] is the substring of s from index k to the end, which is of length L - k.\n\nBut note: k = 2*L - n, so the length of the second part is L - (2*L - n) = n - L.\n\nAnd indeed, the length of t[L:] is n - L, so that matches.\n\nTherefore, for a candidate L (length of s), we must have:\n  L >= ceil(n/2) + 1? Actually, note: \n      n = 2*L - k, and k is at least 1 and at most L-1, so:\n      n_min = 2*L - (L-1) = L+1\n      n_max = 2*L - 1\n\nBut note: the entire string t must be built from two copies of s. \n\nBut wait, we can also consider: the entire t must be such that the first L characters are s, and the next n-L characters (which is the second part) must equal s[k:], and k = 2*L - n.\n\nMoreover, we must have that the second part (t[L:]) is exactly the suffix of s of length n-L, starting at k (which is 2*L-n).\n\nBut note: k must be less than L, so 2*L - n < L  => L < n. Also, k must be positive, so 2*L - n > 0 => L > n/2.\n\nSo L must be in the range (n/2, n). \n\nBut note: the length of s must be greater than n/2 and less than n.\n\nNow, how to iterate? Since n<=100, we can iterate over possible L from floor(n/2)+1 to n-1 (because L must be integer). Then for each L:\n  k = 2*L - n   (must be positive and less than L, which we already have by our range)\n\nThen we set s = t[0:L]\n\nThen we check: \n  The substring t[L:] should be equal to s[k:].\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple possibilities? We can output any s.\n\nHowever, note: the entire second part (of length n-L) must be the same as s[k:]. And k = 2*L-n, so the length of s[k:] is L - (2*L-n) = n-L, which is the same as the length of t[L:].\n\nTherefore, the condition is: t[L:] == s[k:]\n\nBut note: k = 2*L - n, so we can write:\n  t[L:] == t[k:k+(n-L)]   -> but wait, k+(n-L) = 2*L - n + n - L = L, so actually t[L:] == t[k:]\n\nBut wait, we have s = t[0:L], and then we require t[L:] == s[k:] = t[k:L] (but note: k might be greater than L? No, because we have k = 2*L - n, and since L > n/2, then 2*L - n > 0, and we also require k < L, so k is in [1, L-1]. But note: k must be less than L, and our range for L ensures that.\n\nHowever, there's an issue: the substring s[k:] is from index k to the end of s, which is of length L-k, and we are comparing to t[L:], which is of length n-L. We know that L-k = n-L, because:\n  k = 2*L - n  => L-k = L - (2*L-n) = n-L.\n\nSo the lengths match.\n\nBut note: we must ensure that k is at least 1 and less than L, and also that the substring t[L:] is indeed the same as s[k:].\n\nHowever, there is a catch: what if we choose a different L? \n\nExample: \n  t = \"abababab\", n=8.\n\nPossible L: from floor(8/2)+1 = 4+1 to 7.\n\nCheck L=5: k=2*5-8=2. Then s = t[0:5] = \"ababa\", and we require t[5:]==\"babab\" and s[2:]==\"aba\". But \"babab\" != \"aba\", so fails.\n\nL=6: k=2*6-8=4. s=t[0:6]=\"ababab\", then t[6:]=\"ab\", and s[4:]=\"ab\" -> matches. So we have found an s of length 6.\n\nBut wait, note: the problem says that the entire second message (s) is sent, and the error causes an overlap of k (here k=4). Then the merged message is s + s[4:] = \"ababab\" + \"ab\" = \"abababab\", which is t.\n\nSo the answer for t=\"abababab\" is \"YES\\nababab\".\n\nBut note: the example output says: for input \"abababab\", output \"YES\\nababab\".\n\nHowever, the example provided in the input list is: \n  Input: ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\nAnd the expected outputs are:\n  ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\nBut wait, for the second example: \n  Input: \"acacacaca\", output \"YES\\nacaca\"\n\nLet n = 9.\n\nWe consider L from floor(9/2)+1 = 4+1 to 8.\n\nCheck L=5: k=2*5-9=1. s = t[0:5] = \"acaca\", then t[5:]==\"caca\", and s[1:]==\"cacac\"? Wait, no: s[1:] is from index1 to the end: \"acaca\"[1:] = \"cacac\", which has length 4, but t[5:] is \"caca\" (length 4). However, \"cacac\" vs \"caca\": not equal.\n\nL=6: k=2*6-9=3. s=t[0:6]=\"acacac\", then t[6:]=\"aca\", and s[3:]=\"acac\"[3:] -> wait, s[3:] is \"ac\" (if we take from index3: \"acacac\"[3:] is \"ac\"). But t[6:] is \"aca\", which is \"aca\" vs \"ac\" -> not equal.\n\nL=7: k=2*7-9=5. s=t[0:7]=\"acacaca\", then t[7:]=\"ca\", and s[5:]=\"ca\" (since s[5]='c', s[6]='a') -> \"ca\" vs \"ca\" -> equal.\n\nSo we found an s of length 7: \"acacaca\". But the example output says \"acaca\".\n\nWait, the example output says \"YES\\nacaca\", meaning they are using s=\"acaca\" (length 5). \n\nBut wait, why did we get two possibilities? \n\nActually, note: the problem says \"if possible, output any\". But our method found two possibilities? \n\nBut wait, for L=5 we had a failure because the condition was not met. Then why did the example output say \"acaca\"?\n\nWait, let me re-check for L=5 and t=\"acacacaca\":\n\n  t = \"acacacaca\", n=9, L=5, k=2*5-9=1.\n  s = t[0:5] = \"acaca\"\n  t[5:] = \"caca\"\n  s[1:] = \"acaca\"[1:] = \"cacac\"\n\nBut \"caca\" != \"cacac\", so condition fails.\n\nBut wait, the example output says \"YES\\nacaca\". How did they get that?\n\nAlternative view: perhaps we are not restricted to taking the entire first part as s? \n\nWait, the problem says: two identical messages. The entire t is formed by two copies of s. But note: the two copies are consecutive. \n\nBut note: the example output says \"acaca\". So s=\"acaca\". Then the two copies are \"acaca\" and \"acaca\". The error might have occurred with an overlap of 1 or 2 or 3 or 4? \n\nBut note: the condition for the error is that the two copies are merged by overlapping at the same characters. The total length of t is 9. If s has length 5, then the two copies without error would be 10. With an error (overlap) of k, the total length would be 5 + (5-k)=10-k. We have 10-k=9 -> k=1.\n\nBut then the merged string would be: \n  First copy: \"acaca\"\n  Second copy: starting from the first character (overlap k=1) so we take the rest: \"acaca\"[1:] = \"cacac\", so the total string is \"acaca\" + \"cacac\" = \"accacacac\" (wait, no: actually, the first copy is \"acaca\", and the second copy is \"cacac\", so together: \"acaca\" + \"cacac\" = \"accacacac\", which is 9 letters: \n      a c c a c a c a c? \n\nWait, let me write:\n  s = \"acaca\"\n  s[1:] = \"cacac\"\n  Then t = s + s[1:] = \"acaca\" + \"cacac\" = \"accacacac\", which is \"accacacac\", but our input t is \"acacacaca\".\n\nThey are different.\n\nBut wait, the example input is \"acacacaca\", and the example output is \"acaca\". \n\nWait, maybe the example intended to say that the entire string is two copies of \"acaca\" with an overlap of 5? But the overlap must be less than the length of s (which is 5), so maximum overlap 4. \n\nBut note: the example output says \"acaca\", so we must explain how \"acacacaca\" comes from two copies of \"acaca\" with an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example intended to use a different s? \n\nBut wait, the example output says \"acaca\", so let me check with s=\"acaca\" and see if there's an overlap that produces \"acacacaca\".\n\nActually, note: the entire t is \"acacacaca\". \n\nIf we break it as two copies of s=\"acaca\", then the first copy is \"acaca\", and the second copy is \"caca\" (which is the last 4 characters). But wait, the second copy must be a contiguous part of s? \n\nThe problem says: the two messages are identical. So the second message is \"acaca\". Then the merging is done by overlapping at the same symbols. \n\nBut note: the problem does not specify that the entire second message is used. It says: the two identical messages are sent, and then an error causes a merge by overlapping. The merge takes the entire second message and overlaps it by k characters (from the beginning of the second message). \n\nBut wait, the example says: \n  \"For example, if two messages 'abrakadabra' are sent, the result might be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (overlap 1) or 'abrakadabrakadabra' (overlap 4).\"\n\nIn the example, the entire second message is used, but only the part that does not overlap is appended.\n\nBut note: in the example, the second message is entirely 'abrakadabra'. The overlap part (k) is taken from the beginning of the second message.\n\nSo the process is:\n  t = s + s[k:]\n\nNow, in the example \"acacacaca\", if we take s=\"acaca\", then k must be chosen such that:\n  t = s + s[k:] = \"acaca\" + s[k:]\n\nBut note, the entire t is \"acacacaca\", which is 9 characters. Then the length of the second part is 4. So we require:\n  len(s) + (len(s)-k) = 9 -> 5 + (5-k)=9 -> k=1.\n\nThen we require: s[1:] = \"cacac\", and then t = \"acaca\"+\"cacac\" = \"accacacac\", which is not \"acacacaca\".\n\nBut wait, what if we break t differently? Maybe the two copies of s are not the entire first part? \n\nWait, the problem says: the two identical messages are sent. The first message is s, and the second message is s. Then an error causes a merge: we take the first message and then the second message but remove the first k characters (because the last k characters of the first message and the first k characters of the second message are merged). \n\nBut note: the example output says \"acaca\", so we must find an s of length 5 that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example intended to use s=\"aca\" (length 3) or something else? \n\nBut the example output says \"acaca\", so we must find a way to represent \"acacacaca\" as s + s[k:] with s=\"acaca\".\n\nWait, maybe we are not forced to take the entire string as two copies of s? \n\nWait, no: the entire string t is the result. \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"By transmission of two identical messages\". So the two messages are s and s, and the entire t is built from these two.\n\nBut wait, there's an alternative: maybe the two messages are not necessarily the entire string? \n\nActually, the problem doesn't specify that the entire string t must be built from the two copies. But the problem says: \"the obtained message t\". So the entire t is the result.\n\nBut then, how can we get \"acacacaca\" from two copies of \"acaca\"? \n\nWait, let me try to break \"acacacaca\" into two copies of \"acaca\":\n\n  First copy: \"acaca\"\n  Second copy: \"caca\" (which is the last 4 characters). \n\nBut note: the second copy is \"acaca\", so we cannot just take \"caca\". \n\nUnless the error merging is defined as: we take the first message (s) and then the second message (s) but we skip the first k characters (where k is the length of the overlap). However, the entire second message must be s, so the part that is appended is s[k:]. \n\nBut then, the entire second message is s, so the appended part is s[k:], and the entire string t is s + s[k:].\n\nBut then, the total length is 5 + (5-k)=10-k. We require 10-k=9 -> k=1, then appended part is s[1:]==\"cacac\", so t becomes \"acaca\"+\"cacac\" = \"accacacac\", which is not \"acacacaca\".\n\nWait, but the example input is \"acacacaca\", and the example output says \"acaca\". \n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the example might have intended a different interpretation.\n\nWait, the example input list is: \n  ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\nAnd the expected outputs are:\n  ['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\nSo for \"acacacaca\", the expected output is \"acaca\".\n\nBut wait, there's an alternative: maybe the error can occur only once, and the entire string t is the result of the first message and then the second message (which is overlapped by k). But what if the second message itself contains an error? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"When two identical messages are transmitted consecutively, there might be an error that merges them\". So only one error? \n\nBut note: the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"acaca\", so we must find an s such that:\n\n  t = s + s[k:]   for some k in [1, len(s)-1].\n\nBut note: the entire string t is 9 characters. Then:\n\n  Let s be of length L, then 2*L - k = 9, and k in [1, L-1]. So L must be at least ceil((9+1)/2)=5, and at most 8.\n\nBut we found for L=7: s=\"acacaca\", and k=5, and then t = \"acacaca\" + \"acaca\"[5:] = \"acacaca\" + \"ca\" -> \"acacacaca\", which matches.\n\nSo we can also represent t as two copies of s=\"acacaca\" (length 7) with an overlap of 5.\n\nBut the example output says \"acaca\" (length 5). \n\nBut the problem says: \"output any\". So we can output either. However, the example output chooses the shorter one? \n\nBut wait, the example output for \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (which is \"abrakadabra\" repeated twice with an overlap of 1) outputs \"abrakadabra\", which is the original string of length 11.\n\nSo why for \"acacacaca\" output is \"acaca\" (length 5) and not \"acacaca\" (length 7)? \n\nBecause the example output is arbitrary. \n\nBut wait, the example input \"acacacaca\" is 9 characters. \n\nIf we use s=\"acaca\" (length 5) then we require k=10-9=1, but then the appended part is s[1:]=\"cacac\", so the total string would be \"acaca\"+\"cacac\" = \"accacacac\", which is 9 characters but not matching \"acacacaca\".\n\nWait, unless the problem allows the second message to be truncated arbitrarily? \n\nBut note: the problem says the two messages are identical. So the second message is s, and then we remove the first k characters. \n\nBut wait, the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"acaca\", so we must have an explanation.\n\nAnother possibility: the error might occur at the boundary of the two messages, but the entire second message is not necessarily the entire s? \n\nWait, no. The problem says: two identical messages. \n\nBut note: the example output says \"acaca\", so maybe the intended solution is to check for the existence of an s such that t is the result of two copies of s with an overlap, but without requiring that the entire t is built by the two copies? \n\nWait, no, the problem says: \"by transmission of two identical messages\", meaning the entire two copies are sent, and then the error causes a merge.\n\nBut wait, there's a known approach for similar problems (like \"String Merge\" or \"Repetitions with Overlap\"):\n\n  We can try to break t into two parts: a prefix and a suffix. Let the prefix be s (the first message) and the suffix be the second message (which is s) but without the first k characters. Then the condition is that the prefix (s) must be equal to the entire second message (s) but we don't know the split.\n\nBut note: the entire t is the concatenation of the first message and the non-overlapping part of the second message. \n\nHowever, there is an alternative: the two messages are s and s, and the merged string is s + s[k:].\n\nBut the entire string t must be exactly that.\n\nBut then, for \"acacacaca\", we cannot use s=\"acaca\" because then the merged string would be \"accacacac\", not \"acacacaca\".\n\nWait, unless the example intended that the two copies are not necessarily the entire string? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"the obtained message t\". So the entire t is the result.\n\nBut note: the example output for \"acacacaca\" is \"YES\\nacaca\". \n\nThis implies that the intended solution might be to check for the existence of a string s such that t is a substring of s+s? \n\nWait, that is a common trick in circular string problems. \n\nCondition: t must be a substring of s+s (for s being a substring of t, but wait) and the length of t must be less than 2*len(s). \n\nBut note: the error condition requires that the two copies are merged with an overlap (so the entire t is built from two copies, but the second copy is truncated by the overlap). \n\nBut note: the example \"abcabc\": \n  Check if \"abcabc\" is a substring of s+s, where s is \"abc\". Then s+s = \"abcabc\", so yes, but the problem says no error. \n\nSo we cannot use the substring condition alone.\n\nBut wait, the condition for an error is that the two copies are merged, meaning the entire t is built by two copies of s with an overlap (so the length of t is between len(s)+1 and 2*len(s)-1). \n\nBut note: the example \"abcabc\": \n  If we break t=\"abcabc\", then we require an s such that t = s + s[k:] and 0<k<len(s). \n  The length of t is 6. Then for s=\"abc\", we would require 3 + (3-k)=6 -> k=0, which is not allowed. \n  For s=\"abcab\", then k=2*5-6=4 -> but 4 is not <5? Actually, 4<5, then t = \"abcab\" + \"abcab\"[4:] = \"abcab\" + \"c\" = \"abcabc\" -> wait, that matches.\n\nBut wait, then we have found an s=\"abcab\" (length 5) for t=\"abcabc\". Then why is the example output \"NO\"?\n\nWait, wait! \n\nBut note: the two messages must be identical. In this case, the two messages are both \"abcab\"? Then the first message is \"abcab\", and the second message is \"abcab\", and the error caused an overlap of 4. Then the merged string is \"abcab\" + \"abcab\"[4:] = \"abcab\"+\"c\" = \"abcabc\", which is correct.\n\nBut then the example \"abcabc\" should be YES with s=\"abcab\". However, the example output is \"NO\".\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nWait, let me read the example again: \n  \"An example: if two messages 'abrakadabra' are sent consecutively, it is possible that the result will be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' or 'abrakadabrakadabra' (in the first case, the overlap is 1, and in the second, the overlap is 4).\"\n\nBut note: the example \"abcabc\" is explicitly stated as having no error.\n\nSo why is \"abcabc\" not an error? \n\nBecause the problem states: \"The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and then they merge\". \n\nBut note: the two messages are the same. In the example \"abcabc\", if the two messages were \"abc\", then we would have two copies of \"abc\", and the merged string would be \"abcabc\", but that is without any overlap (k=0) which is not allowed. \n\nHowever, we found a representation with s=\"abcab\" (which is longer than the obvious period). \n\nBut wait, the problem does not specify that the two messages are the minimal string. They could be any string s. \n\nBut then, why is \"abcabc\" not an error? \n\nBecause the problem says: \"if the obtained message t can be represented in this way, then output YES\". \n\nAnd we just showed that it can be represented with s=\"abcab\". \n\nBut the example output says \"NO\". \n\nThis indicates that there is an additional constraint: the two messages must be the minimal representation? \n\nWait, no. The problem does not say minimal. \n\nBut wait, the example output says for \"abcabc\" is \"NO\", meaning no error. \n\nSo what is the issue? \n\nThe key is: the two messages must be identical. In the representation with s=\"abcab\", the two messages are \"abcab\", but then the entire string t=\"abcabc\" is built from two copies of \"abcab\" with an overlap of 4. \n\nBut is that valid? \n\nYes, according to the rules: \n  t = s + s[4:] = \"abcab\" + \"c\" = \"abcabc\"\n\nBut note: the entire second message is \"abcab\", and the error causes the first 4 characters of the second message to be merged with the last 4 characters of the first message. \n\nBut wait, the first message is \"abcab\", and the second message is \"abcab\". The last 4 characters of the first message are \"bcab\", and the first 4 characters of the second message are \"abca\". These are not the same? \n\nAh! There is the catch: the problem states that the merging is only possible by overlapping at the same characters. \n\nThat means the overlapping part must be identical. \n\nIn the example \"abcabc\", with s=\"abcab\", the overlap part is the last 4 characters of the first message and the first 4 characters of the second message. \n\nBut the first message is \"abcab\", so its last 4 characters are \"bcab\".\nThe second message is \"abcab\", so its first 4 characters are \"abca\".\n\nThese two strings \"bcab\" and \"abca\" are not the same. \n\nTherefore, the overlap condition is not satisfied. \n\nSo we require that the overlapping part (the last k characters of the first message and the first k characters of the second message) are identical.\n\nBut in our candidate, we require that s[0:L] = s[0:L] (trivial) and also that the suffix of the first s (of length k) is equal to the prefix of the second s (of length k). \n\nBut wait, the second s is the same as the first s, so the prefix of the second s is s[0:k] and the suffix of the first s is s[L-k:L]. \n\nBut for the merge to occur, we require that the last k characters of the first s (which is s[L-k:]) are equal to the first k characters of the second s (which is s[0:k]). \n\nBut the second s is the same as the first s, so we require:\n  s[L-k:L] == s[0:k]\n\nBut in our candidate for \"abcabc\" with s=\"abcab\" (L=5, k=4):\n  s[L-k:L] = s[1:5] = \"bcab\"\n  s[0:k] = s[0:4] = \"abca\"\n\nBut \"bcab\" != \"abca\", so the overlap is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the condition is not only that t = s + s[k:], but also that the overlapping part (the last k of the first s and the first k of the second s) must be identical. \n\nBut wait, the second s is the same as the first s, so we require that the last k characters of s (which is s[L-k:]) must be equal to the first k characters of s (which is s[0:k]).\n\nSo the condition for candidate s (of length L) and k=2*L-n (which must be between 1 and L-1) is:\n\n  1. t[0:L] == s\n  2. t[L:] == s[k:]   (which is the same as saying the part from L to the end is the tail of s after the overlap)\n  3. Additionally, the overlapping part must match: the last k characters of s must equal the first k characters of s.\n\nBut wait, condition 2 already uses s[k:], and condition 3 is that s[0:k] == s[L-k:L].\n\nBut note: the entire s is fixed. Condition 2 is: t[L:] = s[k:L+k'] ??? \n\nWait, let's reexamine:\n\n  t = s + s[k:]   (this is the structure)\n\nBut the merging process requires that the overlapping part (the last k characters of the first s and the first k characters of the second s) are the same. \n\nBut the second s is the same as the first s, so the first k characters of the second s are s[0:k]. \n\nAnd the last k characters of the first s are s[L-k:L]. \n\nSo we require s[L-k:L] == s[0:k].\n\nBut also, the entire t is built as: \n  t = s + s[k:L]   (because the second message's part that is appended is from index k to the end, which is s[k:])\n\nBut note: the length of the appended part is L - k, and the length of t[L:] is n - L, so we require L - k = n - L => n = 2*L - k.\n\nNow, the condition for the overlap is that the last k characters of s (which is s[L-k:L]) must be equal to the first k characters of s (which is s[0:k]).\n\nBut note: this is automatically true if we define s as the first part and then the second part is s[k:], because the second part is defined from s. But wait, no: the second part is s[k:], so the entire s is fixed and the condition for the overlap is that the suffix of s of length k is equal to the prefix of s of length k.\n\nTherefore, we must add the condition that s[-k:] == s[:k].\n\nBut note: k = 2*L - n, and L is the length of s.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\n  Let n = len(t)\n\n  We iterate over L from floor(n/2)+1 to n-1 (inclusive) [since L>n/2 and L<n]\n\n  For each L:\n      k = 2*L - n\n      if k < 1 or k >= L: continue   (but by our range, k should be in [1, L-1] because L>n/2 -> k=2L-n>L? Let me check: 2L-n > L -> L>n, but we have L<n, so k=2L-n < L. And k>0 because L>n/2 -> 2L>n -> k=2L-n>0. So we don't need to check the bounds for k? Actually, k is between 1 and L-1.)\n\n  Then, set s = t[0:L]\n  Check if t[L:] == s[k:]   (this is the appended part from the second message)\n\n  And also, check if s[-",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` can be formed by concatenating two identical strings `s` with an overlap of some positive length less than the length of `s`. The solution involves checking all possible valid lengths for `s` and verifying the conditions required for the overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the string `t` must be formed by taking a string `s` and appending the substring of `s` starting from some index `k` (where `0 < k < len(s)`). This means `t` should be structured as `s + s[k:]`, and the overlapping part (the last `k` characters of the first `s` and the first `k` characters of the second `s`) must match exactly.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible length `L` of `s` (from `floor(n/2) + 1` to `n-1`), we calculate the overlap `k` as `2*L - n`. We then check if the first `L` characters of `t` form `s` and if the remaining characters of `t` match `s[k:]`. Additionally, the overlapping part must satisfy `s[0:k] == s[L-k:L]`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Iterate over all possible lengths `L` of `s`. For each `L`, compute `k` and verify the conditions. If any `L` satisfies the conditions, output `YES` and the corresponding `s`; otherwise, output `NO`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm checks all possible lengths `L` from approximately `n/2` to `n-1`, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case (since each check involves slicing and comparing strings of length up to `n`). Given the constraint `n ≤ 100`, this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    \n    found = False\n    ans_s = None\n    \n    for L in range((n // 2) + 1, n):\n        k = 2 * L - n\n        if k < 1 or k >= L:\n            continue\n            \n        s = t[:L]\n        if n - L != len(s) - k:\n            continue\n            \n        if t[L:] == s[k:]:\n            if s[:k] == s[L - k:]:\n                found = True\n                ans_s = s\n                break\n                \n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(ans_s)\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `L` of `s` (from `floor(n/2) + 1` to `n-1`), compute the overlap `k` as `2*L - n`.\n3. **Check Conditions**: For each `L`, check if the substring `t[L:]` matches `s[k:]` and if the overlapping parts `s[0:k]` and `s[L-k:L]` are identical.\n4. **Output Result**: If any valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by `s`; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways the string `t` could be formed by two overlapping copies of `s`, ensuring correctness while adhering to the problem constraints.",
