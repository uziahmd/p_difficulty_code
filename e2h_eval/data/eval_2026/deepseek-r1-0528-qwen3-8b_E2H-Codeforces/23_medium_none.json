In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles. Each tile is a string of two characters: first digit (1-9) and second one of 'm','p','s'\n\n We can draw any number of tiles (each draw adds one tile) and we can choose arbitrarily (even duplicates).\n\n We need the minimum number of draws so that there is at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Note: \n   - A koutsu is three identical tiles (same number and same suit).\n   - A shuntsu is three consecutive numbers in the same suit (e.g., [n, n+1, n+2]).\n\n However, note that after drawing some tiles, we have more than three? Actually, we start with three and then add k tiles (k>=0) so total tiles = 3+k.\n\n But note: we only require that there is at least one mentsu (three tiles that form either a triplet or a sequence). The rest can be anything.\n\n However, the problem says: \"she must have at least one mentsu\", and she can draw as many as she wants (minimum) to achieve that.\n\n Since we are allowed to draw arbitrarily, we can consider:\n\n Possibilities:\n\n 1. Already have a mentsu -> 0 draws.\n\n 2. Otherwise, we can try to form a mentsu by drawing 1, 2, or even 3 tiles?\n\n But note: we can also break down the problem:\n\n Let's denote:\n   - We have three tiles initially.\n\n We can think about:\n\n Option 1: Koutsu (triplet)\n   - We need three of the same tile.\n\n   With zero draws: if we have three same, done.\n\n   With one draw: we can have two of a kind and then draw one more of the same to complete the triplet.\n\n   But note: what if we have two different pairs? Actually, we have only three tiles. So possibilities:\n\n     Case: [a, b, c] (all distinct)\n\n        Option for triplet: we can try to complete a pair.\n\n        For example, if we have two same tiles, then we can complete with one draw.\n\n        If we don't have two same, then we need two draws (to get two copies of one tile) but wait, we can draw two same tiles.\n\n        However, note: we can also form a triplet by drawing three new ones? But that would be three draws. But we want minimum.\n\n        Actually, we can draw one tile to complete a pair (if we have two of a kind). But if we don't have two of a kind, then we cannot complete with one draw.\n\n        Alternatively, we can form a triplet from scratch? We have three distinct, so we can change all three to the same tile? But that would require three draws (because we have to replace each of the three). But wait, we can also keep two and change one? Actually, no: we have three distinct, so we can't form a triplet without having at least two of one type.\n\n        However, we are allowed to draw arbitrarily and we don't have to use the existing ones. But the goal is to minimize draws.\n\n        But note: we can draw up to three tiles and then we have six tiles. Then we can pick three of the same. But that requires three draws and then we have a triplet.\n\n        However, is there a better way?\n\n        Actually, we can also form a triplet by drawing two tiles (if we have one tile, then draw two of the same) but wait: we have three distinct. So we can choose to discard two and then draw two? No, the problem doesn't say we can discard. We just draw extra tiles. And then we look for a mentsu in the entire hand.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"after drawing\", we have more tiles. Then we need to check if there is a mentsu. However, we are allowed to have more than three.\n\n        However, the requirement is to have at least one mentsu. So we can use the original three plus the drawn ones arbitrarily.\n\n        Important: the drawn tiles can be any. So we can choose to draw two tiles and then have five tiles. Then we can use three of them to form a triplet.\n\n        But actually, we don't need to use all the tiles. So we can consider:\n\n          - If we have at least two of a tile, then we can complete the triplet by drawing one more.\n\n          - If we have exactly one of each, then we need to draw two more of one of the tiles (so we have three of that one) OR we can draw three of a new tile (then we have three of the new tile).\n\n        Which is cheaper? \n\n          Option 1: Draw two more of an existing tile (say we have one of tile A, one of B, one of C). We choose one of A, and draw two more A's -> total two draws.\n\n          Option 2: Draw three of a new tile (not present in the hand) -> three draws.\n\n        So minimum for triplet when having three distinct is two.\n\n        But wait, maybe we can use the possibility of forming a triplet from a different set? Actually, we have three distinct, so we cannot form a triplet without adding at least two.\n\n        However, note: we can also mix and match? Actually, no: triplet requires three identical.\n\n        So for triplet:\n\n          - If there's a tile that appears at least two times, then we need 1 draw (if there are two) or 0 (if three).\n          - If all are distinct, then we need 2 draws.\n\n Option 2: Shuntsu (sequence)\n\n   Conditions: three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\n   Example: [1,2,3] in the same suit.\n\n   What are the constraints for the numbers? They must be consecutive and in the same suit.\n\n   The numbers are from 1 to 9.\n\n   We can consider:\n\n     - Already have a shuntsu: 0 draws.\n\n     - Otherwise, we can form a shuntsu by drawing one or two tiles.\n\n   How?\n\n     We have three tiles. Let's group by suit.\n\n     For a given suit, we can have multiple tiles (from 1 to 9). We can form a shuntsu if we have three consecutive numbers.\n\n     However, we might have two tiles in the same suit. Then we can complete the sequence by drawing one tile (the missing number in between or at the ends? Actually, a shuntsu requires consecutive. \n\n     Example: [2,3,?] in the same suit -> we can draw 1 or 4? But wait, the sequence must be three consecutive. So:\n\n        To form a sequence from [2,3]: \n          - We can form [1,2,3] by drawing 1.\n          - Or [2,3,4] by drawing 4.\n\n        Similarly, [1,2]: we can form [1,2,3] (draw 3) or [0,1,2] (invalid because 0 not allowed). So only [1,2,3] is possible.\n\n        Similarly, [8,9]: we can form [7,8,9] (draw 7) or [8,9,10] (invalid because 10 not allowed). So only [7,8,9].\n\n        Also, [3,5]: we can form [3,4,5] (draw 4) or [2,3,5] (but 2,3,5 is not consecutive) or [3,5,6] (again not consecutive). Actually, we can only form a sequence by having the three consecutive numbers. \n\n        But note: we are allowed to have more than three tiles. So we can also form a sequence from two non-consecutive numbers? \n\n        Example: [1,3,5] in the same suit: \n          - We can draw one tile to form [1,2,3] (by drawing 2) or [3,4,5] (by drawing 4). So one draw.\n\n        However, what if we have two separate pairs that are not connected? \n\n        Actually, the hand has three tiles. So we can have:\n\n          Case 1: All three tiles in the same suit and consecutive: already good.\n\n          Case 2: Two tiles in the same suit, and the third in a different suit.\n\n          Case 3: Three tiles in two different suits.\n\n        We are going to consider the possibility of forming a shuntsu.\n\n        Steps for shuntsu:\n\n          Group the tiles by suit.\n\n          For each suit, we have a multiset of numbers.\n\n          We can sort the numbers for that suit and then try to see if we can form a consecutive sequence of three.\n\n          However, we are allowed to draw extra tiles (anywhere from 1 to 9) in that suit.\n\n          The minimal number of draws for a particular suit to form a shuntsu:\n\n            Let S be the sorted list of distinct numbers in that suit (or we can consider duplicates? Actually, duplicates don't help for a sequence unless we use one of the duplicates to fill in? But note: we need three consecutive distinct numbers. Duplicates are allowed in the hand, but the sequence requires three consecutive numbers (each distinct). However, if we have duplicates, they can be used to form multiple sequences? Actually, no: the problem does not specify that the tiles are removed, but we are only looking for the existence of one mentsu.\n\n          However, note: the hand will consist of the original three and the drawn ones. We can use the same tile only once? Actually, no: the problem does not say that we use distinct tiles. But a mentsu is defined by three tiles. So we cannot use the same tile twice.\n\n          Therefore, we require three distinct tiles (with distinct numbers? Actually, no: the definition of shuntsu requires consecutive numbers, and consecutive numbers are distinct. But note: the tile representation is (number, suit). So two tiles with the same number and suit are duplicates. \n\n          However, the condition for shuntsu is three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit. So the numbers must be distinct and consecutive.\n\n          So we can use each tile only once.\n\n          Therefore, we must have three distinct tiles (in terms of number) in the same suit that form a consecutive sequence.\n\n          Now, how many draws are needed for a suit with a given multiset of numbers to form a consecutive sequence of three?\n\n          We can consider:\n\n            Let the suit have a set of distinct numbers (we don't care about duplicates beyond one because having two of the same number doesn't help for consecutive sequence).\n\n          Steps:\n\n            We are allowed to draw any tile (any number in [1,9] in that suit). We want the minimum number of draws to have at least one set of three consecutive numbers.\n\n            This is similar to a classic \"minimum removals\" or \"minimum additions\" to form a consecutive sequence? Actually, we are adding.\n\n            We can consider gaps.\n\n            Example:\n\n              Suit has [1,2,4,5] -> then we have two consecutive sequences: [1,2] and [4,5]. But we need three consecutive. We can form [1,2,3] by drawing 3, or [2,3,4] by drawing 3, or [4,5,6] by drawing 6. So one draw.\n\n            How to compute the minimal draws for one suit?\n\n            Actually, we are not limited to using the existing numbers. We can form a sequence anywhere.\n\n            However, we can use the existing numbers to minimize the draws.\n\n            We want to cover three consecutive numbers. Let the consecutive sequence be [x, x+1, x+2]. We can choose x from 1 to 7.\n\n            For a fixed x, we need to have at least one tile for x, one for x+1, and one for x+2.\n\n            But note: we can use the same tile for multiple sequences? No, because we are only concerned with having one mentsu. However, we are allowed to have overlapping sequences? Actually, we can use the same tile in multiple sequences, but we are only required to have one set of three.\n\n            However, we are counting the total draws. We are going to consider the entire hand (all suits) and we can form a shuntsu in any one suit.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to draw tiles in any suit. However, to form a shuntsu, we must draw in the same suit.\n\n            Approach:\n\n              We are going to consider the possibility of forming a shuntsu in each suit independently.\n\n              For a given suit, let the set of distinct numbers present be D (and we can ignore duplicates because having more than one doesn't help for the consecutive sequence).\n\n              Then, we can consider each possible consecutive triplet [x, x+1, x+2] (for x from 1 to 7) and count how many of these numbers we already have.\n\n              Then, the number of draws needed for that triplet is (3 - (# of numbers in the triplet that are in D)).\n\n              Then, the minimal draws for this suit to form a shuntsu is the minimum over x of (3 - |D ∩ {x, x+1, x+2}|).\n\n              However, note: we are allowed to draw multiple tiles (each draw is one tile) and we can draw the same tile multiple times? Actually, we are allowed to draw any tile arbitrarily. But note: we are forming a set of three distinct numbers. So if we are missing one, we draw one; if we are missing two, we draw two; if we are missing three, we draw three.\n\n            BUT: we are drawing from the entire hand (which includes other suits) and we can draw in different suits arbitrarily. However, we are focusing on one suit to form a shuntsu.\n\n            However, note: we might form a shuntsu in a suit that originally had no tiles? Then we have to draw three.\n\n            Example: empty suit: then we need to draw three (for example, [1,2,3] in that suit).\n\n            But wait: we have three tiles initially. So if we have a suit with no tiles, then we must draw three tiles of that suit.\n\n            However, what if we have two suits? We can form a shuntsu in any suit. So we should consider the minimal draws across all suits.\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to draw in any suit. So we can choose to form a shuntsu in a suit that we already have some tiles, or even in a new suit.\n\n            But the problem: we have three tiles. These tiles are distributed among the three suits (m, p, s). So we can have:\n\n              - Tiles in one suit: then we have two suits empty.\n              - Tiles in two suits: then one suit empty.\n\n            So the minimal draws for shuntsu overall is the minimum over:\n\n              - For each suit (including empty ones) the minimal draws to form a shuntsu in that suit.\n\n            However, we can also combine the possibility of using the existing tiles in multiple suits? Actually, no: a shuntsu must be in one suit.\n\n            Therefore, we compute for each suit (m, p, s) the minimal draws to form a shuntsu.\n\n            Steps for one suit:\n\n              Let the suit be represented by a set S (of numbers, from 1 to 9) that we have.\n\n              We consider x from 1 to 7 (the starting number of the consecutive triplet).\n\n              For each x, the triplet T = {x, x+1, x+2}. The number of existing tiles in T is |S ∩ T|.\n\n              Then the cost for this triplet is max(0, 3 - |S ∩ T|) [but actually, we cannot have negative, so just 3 - |S ∩ T| if |S ∩ T|<=3, else 0? Actually, we are trying to form one triplet, so we need at least one occurrence of each in T. But we are allowed to draw multiple tiles? Actually, we are allowed to draw as many as needed. However, if we have duplicates, they don't help because we need distinct numbers.\n\n              But note: we can use the same drawn tile for multiple purposes? Actually, no: we are forming one specific triplet. We need three distinct numbers.\n\n              However, we are allowed to draw multiple tiles of the same number? The problem says we can draw any tiles arbitrarily. But for forming a consecutive triplet, we need three distinct numbers.\n\n              But note: we can draw the same number multiple times? Then we can use one of the duplicates to complete the triplet? Actually, no: because we need three distinct numbers. So if we have two of the same number, then we cannot use both for two different positions.\n\n              Actually, the representation: each tile is (number, suit). So two tiles with the same number and same suit are identical. But in a sequence, we need three distinct numbers. So even if we have two tiles with the same number, we can use at most one.\n\n              Therefore, we are only interested in the distinct numbers in the suit.\n\n            However, wait: what if we have two tiles of the same number? Then we have that number available. But we only need one copy of each.\n\n            Therefore, for a suit, we only care about the set of numbers (ignoring duplicates).\n\n            Then, the minimal draws for a suit is:\n\n              min_{x=1 to 7} (max(0, 3 - |S ∩ {x, x+1, x+2}|))\n\n            But note: we can also form a shuntsu that uses numbers outside the range [1,9]? No, because the tiles are from 1 to 9.\n\n            However, there is another possibility: we might use the same drawn tile for multiple sequences? Actually, no, because we are forming one specific triplet.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to draw tiles arbitrarily. So we can choose which numbers to draw.\n\n            However, the above formula counts the minimal draws to complete a particular triplet. Then we take the best triplet (lowest cost).\n\n            Then, the overall minimal draws for a shuntsu is the minimum cost over all suits (including the empty suits, which we represent by S=set()).\n\n            However, note: we are allowed to draw in any suit. So we can choose to form a shuntsu in the suit that requires the least draws.\n\n            But wait: the hand has three tiles. We cannot draw negative tiles. And we are going to consider the entire hand (the three initial tiles) and then the drawn ones.\n\n            However, the above calculation for a suit does not consider that we might already have some tiles in that suit. And we are going to use the initial tiles.\n\n            So for each suit, we know the set of numbers we have.\n\n            Then, the minimal draws for a shuntsu is:\n\n                min( \n                    min_draws_for_suit('m'),\n                    min_draws_for_suit('p'),\n                    min_draws_for_suit('s')\n                )\n\n            But wait, we are allowed to draw from any suit. However, if we have two suits, we can choose to form a shuntsu in the suit that requires the least draws, regardless of which suit we draw from.\n\n            However, we are also allowed to use the initial tiles from any suit. The initial tiles are given.\n\n            Example: Input ['1s', '2s', '3s'] -> already a shuntsu in 's'. So 0.\n\n            Example: Input ['1m', '1m', '1m'] -> triplet, so 0.\n\n            Example: Input ['1m', '1m', '2m'] -> we can form a triplet by drawing one more '1m', so 1 for triplet. For shuntsu: in suit 'm' we have {1,2}. Then for x=1: {1,2,3} -> we have 2, so missing 1 and 3? Actually, we have 1 and 2, so we are missing 3. Then the triplet [1,2,3] requires 1 draw (because we have two out of three). But wait, we already have two of 1 and one of 2. So we need to draw one tile: 3. Then we have the sequence [1,2,3]. So shuntsu can be formed with one draw. But note: we also have the option of forming a triplet: we have two 1's, so we draw one more 1 to get a triplet. So both options are one draw.\n\n            However, we are asked for the minimum number of draws so that she can win (i.e., has at least one mentsu). So we can choose the best option.\n\n            Therefore, we must consider both possibilities (triplet and shuntsu) and take the minimum.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              Step 1: Check if the hand already contains a mentsu (either a triplet or a shuntsu). If yes, output 0.\n\n              Step 2: Otherwise, consider:\n\n                  Option A: Form a triplet (koutsu). How?\n\n                      Count the frequency of each tile (considering suit and number). For a tile (n, s), we count how many we have.\n\n                      For each distinct tile (n,s) that appears at least once, the number of draws needed to complete a triplet is (3 - count). But if count==3, then 0. If count>=3, we don't need to draw (but the problem says we can draw arbitrarily, but we don't need to). Actually, we are starting with three tiles, so maximum count for a tile is 3? Or we can have more? The input is three tiles. So initially, the maximum frequency for a tile is 3 (if all three are the same). But if we have two of one and one of another, then maximum is 2.\n\n                      However, we are allowed to draw arbitrarily, so we can also form a triplet from a tile that is not present at all? Then we need three draws.\n\n                      Actually, the minimal draws for triplet is:\n\n                          Let freq be the frequency of the most frequent tile.\n\n                          Then, if freq >= 3: 0\n                          Else if freq == 2: then we need 1 draw (because we have two, so we need one more)\n                          Else (freq == 1): then we need 2 draws (because we have one, so we need two more)\n\n                      But wait: what if we have three distinct tiles? Then the maximum frequency is 1. Then we need two draws to complete a triplet (by drawing two more of one of them). However, we can also consider drawing three new tiles (all the same) which is three draws. But two is cheaper.\n\n                      However, note: we can also form a triplet from a tile that is not present at all? Then we need three draws. But we have three distinct tiles, so we have three different tiles. Then we can choose one of them to duplicate (by drawing two) and that gives two draws.\n\n                      So the minimal draws for triplet is:\n\n                          Let max_freq = maximum frequency of any tile (considering both number and suit) in the hand.\n\n                          Then, if max_freq >= 3: 0\n                          elif max_freq == 2: 1\n                          else: 2\n\n                  Option B: Form a shuntsu (sequence). How?\n\n                      We break the hand into three suits: m, p, s.\n\n                      For each suit, we collect the distinct numbers (ignore duplicates) that appear.\n\n                      Then for each suit, we compute:\n\n                          min_draws = min_{x from 1 to 7} (3 - len(set([x, x+1, x+2]) & set_of_numbers_in_that_suit))\n\n                      Then, the minimal draws for shuntsu is the minimum of these min_draws over the three suits.\n\n                      However, note: we can also draw from a suit that we don't have any tile? Then the set_of_numbers_in_that_suit is empty, so for any x, we have 0 matches, so cost=3. Then we compare with the other suits.\n\n                  Step 3: Answer is the minimum between the triplet option and the shuntsu option.\n\n            However, wait: is it possible that we can form a mentsu by drawing a tile that completes both a triplet and a shuntsu? Actually, we don't care, because we only need one mentsu.\n\n            Example: ['1m', '1m', '1m'] -> triplet already (0). But what if we have ['1m','1m','2m']? \n\n              Triplet: we have two 1m, so we can complete to three 1m (1 draw) OR we can form a shuntsu [1m,2m,?] -> we have 1 and 2, so we need 3 (one draw). So either way, one draw.\n\n            But note: the problem does not require to form a specific type. So we can choose the cheaper option.\n\n            However, the above two options are independent. We must consider the minimal draws for either forming a triplet (any triplet) or a shuntsu (any shuntsu) in the entire hand.\n\n            Therefore, we compute:\n\n              ans_triplet = \n                  if there exists a tile with frequency 3: 0\n                  else if there exists a tile with frequency 2: 1\n                  else: 2\n\n            But wait: is it always true that if we don't have a triplet already, then we can form one by drawing 1 or 2? \n\n            However, note: we are allowed to draw any tiles. So we can choose to draw two of the same tile (if we have one) to complete a triplet. \n\n            But what if we have three distinct tiles? Then we can choose one of them and draw two copies (so two draws). \n\n            However, there's a catch: what if we have two different tiles that are the same number but different suit? \n\n            Example: ['1m','1p','1s']: \n                Frequency for '1m':1, '1p':1, '1s':1 -> so triplet: we need two draws (to complete one of them).\n\n            But note: the definition of triplet requires identical tiles (same number and same suit). So [1m,1p,1s] is not a triplet.\n\n            Therefore, we must consider the tile as (number, suit) as distinct.\n\n            So we have to count per distinct tile (each tile is identified by the string).\n\n            In the input, the tiles are given as three strings. Each string is two characters.\n\n            Example: Input: \"1m 1p 1s\" -> three distinct tiles (each has different (suit, number) pair). \n\n            Therefore, the triplet calculation: we look at the entire hand and count the frequency of each distinct tile (each distinct (number, suit)).\n\n            So:\n\n                tiles = ['1m', '1p', '1s'] -> frequencies: each 1.\n\n                Then triplet: 2 draws.\n\n            Similarly, for shuntsu: we break by suit.\n\n                For suit 'm': {'1'} -> minimal draws for m: min_{x}(3 - |{x,x+1,x+2} ∩ {1}|) \n                    x=1: {1,2,3} -> 3 - 1 = 2\n                    x=2: {2,3,4} -> 3 - 0 = 3\n                    ... so minimal is 2.\n\n                Similarly for p and s: same.\n\n                So shuntsu: 2 draws.\n\n            Then the answer is min(2,2) = 2.\n\n            But wait: is there a better way? \n\n            Actually, we can also form a shuntsu by drawing two tiles and then combining with two of the existing? \n\n            However, note: we have three distinct tiles. We cannot use two of the same number because they are in different suits. \n\n            So the minimal draws is 2.\n\n            Another example: ['1m','2m','3m'] -> already a shuntsu, so 0.\n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','2m'] -> \n                Triplet: we have two '1m', so 1 draw.\n                Shuntsu: in suit 'm': distinct numbers {1,2}. Then:\n                    x=1: {1,2,3} -> we have 1 and 2, so 3-2 = 1 draw.\n                    x=2: {2,3,4} -> we have 2, so 3-1 = 2 draws.\n                    ... so minimal is 1.\n\n                Then answer = min(1,1) = 1.\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> \n                Triplet: no tile repeated, so 2 draws.\n                Shuntsu: in suit 'm': distinct numbers {1,2,4}\n                    x=1: {1,2,3} -> we have 1,2 -> missing 3: 1 draw.\n                    x=2: {2,3,4} -> we have 2,4 -> missing 3: 1 draw.\n                    x=3: {3,4,5} -> missing 3,5: 2 draws.\n                    ... so minimal is 1.\n\n                Answer = 1.\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> we can form a shuntsu by drawing one tile (either 3 to complete [1,2,3] or [2,3,4]). So one draw.\n\n            But wait: the hand has three tiles. After drawing one tile, we have four. Then we can form a mentsu (shuntsu) by picking three of them (the original three plus the drawn one, or two of the original and the drawn one and one more? Actually, no: the mentsu is defined by three tiles. We can choose any three. So we can use [1m,2m,3m] (if we draw 3m) or [2m,3m,4m] (if we draw 3m). \n\n            However, note: we are allowed to have extra tiles. So yes.\n\n            Therefore, we have:\n\n              Option triplet: 2 draws (because no triplet base, so we need two draws to duplicate one of the tiles to form a triplet)\n\n              Option shuntsu: 1 draw\n\n            Then answer is 1.\n\n            Now, what about the case where we have two different suits and we can form a triplet in one suit and a shuntsu in the other? \n\n            Example: ['1m','1m','1p'] -> \n                Triplet: we have two '1m' (so we can complete to three '1m') -> 1 draw.\n                Shuntsu: \n                    suit 'm': {1} -> minimal draws 2 (because we need two more for [1,2,3])\n                    suit 'p': {1} -> minimal draws 2 (same)\n\n                Then the minimal for shuntsu is 2.\n\n                So answer = min(1,2) = 1.\n\n            Example: ['1m','2p','3p'] -> \n                Triplet: all distinct (each tile appears once) -> 2 draws.\n                Shuntsu: \n                    suit 'p': {2,3} -> \n                        x=2: {2,3,4} -> 3-2=1\n                    suit 'm': {1} -> 2\n                    suit 's': {} -> 3\n                Then shuntsu: 1 draw.\n\n                Answer = 1.\n\n            But wait: is it possible that we can form a triplet by drawing one tile? \n\n            We have ['1m','2p','3p'] -> we can draw one tile to complete a triplet? \n\n            We need three identical tiles. We have three distinct tiles. So we can draw two more of one of them (so two draws) or three of a new one (three draws). So triplet requires two or three draws.\n\n            However, the above triplet calculation: \n\n                We have three distinct tiles (each tile is distinct: '1m','2p','3p'). So the maximum frequency is 1. Then triplet: 2 draws.\n\n            So our triplet calculation is correct.\n\n            Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n              Step 1: Parse the input (one line with three strings)\n\n              Step 2: Check if there is already a mentsu (either triplet or shuntsu) in the three tiles.\n\n                  For triplet: check if any tile (same (number, suit)) appears three times. Since we have three tiles, that means if there is a tile that appears three times, then we have triplet.\n\n                  But wait: we have three tiles. So triplet exists if any tile appears three times.\n\n                  However, we can also have a triplet by having three identical tiles. \n\n                  Actually, we have three tiles. So:\n\n                    if there exists a tile that appears three times -> triplet exists.\n\n                  But note: we can have a triplet even if we have three distinct tiles? No, because triplet requires three identical.\n\n                  So:\n\n                    Count the frequency of each tile (each string). \n\n                    If any frequency is 3, then triplet exists.\n\n                  For shuntsu: check if there exists a suit and three consecutive numbers (with distinct numbers) in that suit.\n\n                    Group by suit, then for each suit, extract the distinct numbers (if we have duplicates, we still only need one).\n\n                    Then, check if there exists a consecutive triplet (x, x+1, x+2) such that the suit has all three.\n\n                    But note: we have only three tiles. So we can check:\n\n                      For each suit, let the set of numbers be S.\n\n                      Then, for each x from 1 to 7, check if {x, x+1, x+2} is a subset of S.\n\n                    If found, then shuntsu exists.\n\n              Step 3: If either triplet or shuntsu exists, output 0.\n\n              Step 4: Otherwise, compute:\n\n                  Option_triplet = \n                    Let freq = frequency dictionary for the three tiles (each tile is a key, and we count the frequency of that exact string)\n\n                    max_freq = maximum value in freq.values()\n\n                    if max_freq >= 3: 0\n                    elif max_freq == 2: 1\n                    else: 2\n\n                  Option_shuntsu = \n                    Break the hand into suits: \n                      suits = {'m': set(), 'p': set(), 's': set()}\n                    For each tile in the hand:\n                      number = tile[0]\n                      suit = tile[1]\n                      suits[suit].add(number)\n\n                    Then for each suit, compute:\n\n                      min_draws_suit = float('inf')\n                      for x in range(1, 8):   # x from 1 to 7\n                          triplet_set = {x, x+1, x+2}\n                          common = len(triplet_set & suits[suit])\n                          draws_needed = 3 - common\n                          if draws_needed < min_draws_suit:\n                              min_draws_suit = draws_needed\n\n                    Then Option_shuntsu = min_draws_suit (the minimum over the three suits)\n\n              Step 5: Answer = min(Option_triplet, Option_shuntsu)\n\n            However, wait: is it possible that Option_shuntsu might be negative? No, because common is at least 0, so draws_needed is at most 3.\n\n            Example: empty suit: \n                for x in 1..7: triplet_set is a set of three, common=0 -> draws_needed=3.\n\n            Example: one tile in a suit: \n                common = 1 if the number is in the triplet_set, else 0.\n\n            Example: two tiles in a suit: \n                common = 2 if both numbers are in the triplet_set, else 1 or 0.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            Let's test with the example: ['1m','2m','4m'] for shuntsu:\n\n                suit 'm': set('1','2','4') -> but wait, we have to convert to integers? Actually, the numbers are characters, but we can compare as characters? \n\n                But note: the numbers are digits from '1' to '9'. We can compare by converting to int, but actually, the set is of characters. However, the consecutive condition is based on integer value.\n\n                But wait: the consecutive condition: {x, x+1, x+2} is integer set. But our set is characters. \n\n                We have to be careful.\n\n                We stored the set as characters. Then when we do:\n\n                  triplet_set = {x, x+1, x+2}  -> integers.\n\n                Then we do: common = len(triplet_set & suits[suit])\n\n                But suits[suit] is a set of characters, and triplet_set is integers. \n\n                That will not work.\n\n            Correction: we must store the numbers as integers, or both as integers? \n\n            Let me re-read the input: the tile is a string of two characters: first is digit, second is letter.\n\n            We can store the numbers as integers.\n\n            So:\n\n                suits = {'m': set(), 'p': set(), 's': set()}\n\n                for tile in hand:\n                    num_char = tile[0]\n                    num_int = int(num_char)\n                    suit_char = tile[1]\n                    suits[suit_char].add(num_int)\n\n            Then triplet_set is a set of integers.\n\n            Example: ['1m','2m','4m'] -> suit 'm': {1,2,4}\n\n            Then for x=1: {1,2,3} -> common = {1,2} (since 1 and 2 are in the set) -> 2, so draws_needed=1.\n\n            For x=2: {2,3,4} -> common = {2,4} -> 2, draws_needed=1.\n\n            For x=3: {3,4,5} -> common = {4} -> 1, draws_needed=",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) from her initial three tiles. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial hand already contains a mentsu. A mentsu can be either:\n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n   \n2. **Calculate Minimum Draws for Koutsu**: If no koutsu exists, compute the minimum draws needed to form one. This involves:\n   - Counting the frequency of each tile.\n   - If any tile appears three times, no draws are needed.\n   - If a tile appears twice, one more draw completes the triplet.\n   - If all tiles are distinct, two draws are needed (duplicating one of them).\n\n3. **Calculate Minimum Draws for Shuntsu**: If no shuntsu exists, compute the minimum draws needed to form one. This involves:\n   - Grouping tiles by suit and noting distinct numbers.\n   - For each suit, check all possible consecutive triplets (from 1-2-3 up to 7-8-9).\n   - The draws needed for each triplet is `3 - number of existing tiles in the triplet`.\n   - The minimal draws across all suits is the answer.\n\n4. **Determine Minimum Draws**: The answer is the minimum between the draws needed for koutsu and shuntsu.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = [tile.strip() for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for existing koutsu or shuntsu\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    freq_dict = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        freq_dict[tile] += 1\n        \n    has_koutsu = False\n    for count in freq_dict.values():\n        if count >= 3:\n            has_koutsu = True\n            break\n            \n    suits = defaultdict(set)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num_char = tile[0]\n        suit_char = tile[1]\n        suits[suit_char].add(int(num_char))\n        \n    has_shuntsu = False\n    for suit_set in suits.values():\n        if len(suit_set) < 3:\n            continue\n        sorted_nums = sorted(suit_set)\n        n = len(sorted_nums)\n        for i in range(n - 2):\n            if sorted_nums[i+1] == sorted_nums[i] + 1 and sorted_nums[i+2] == sorted_nums[i] + 2:\n                has_shuntsu = True\n                break\n        if has_shuntsu:\n            break\n\n    if has_koutsu or has_shuntsu:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    # Calculate triplet draws\n    max_freq = max(freq_dict.values())\n    if max_freq == 3:\n        triplet_draws = 0\n    elif max_freq == 2:\n        triplet_draws = 1\n    else:\n        triplet_draws = 2\n        \n    # Calculate shuntsu draws\n    min_shuntsu_draws = float('inf')\n    for suit, num_set in suits.items():\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            triplet = {start, start+1, start+2}\n            common = len(triplet & num_set)\n            draws_needed = 3 - common\n            if draws_needed < current_min:\n                current_min = draws_needed\n        if current_min < min_shuntsu_draws:\n            min_shuntsu_draws = current_min\n            \n    ans = min(triplet_draws, min_shuntsu_draws)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into individual tiles.\n2. **Frequency Dictionary**: A dictionary counts occurrences of each tile to check for existing koutsu.\n3. **Suit Grouping**: Tiles are grouped by suit, and distinct numbers are stored for each suit to check for shuntsu.\n4. **Existing Mentsu Check**: The code checks if any tile appears three times (koutsu) or if any suit has three consecutive numbers (shuntsu). If found, it prints 0 and exits.\n5. **Triplet Calculation**: Based on the maximum frequency of any tile, it calculates the draws needed to form a triplet (0, 1, or 2 draws).\n6. **Shuntsu Calculation**: For each suit, it checks all possible consecutive triplets (1-2-3 up to 7-8-9) and determines the minimal draws required to complete any such triplet.\n7. **Result**: The minimum between the triplet and shuntsu draws is printed as the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a mentsu with minimal draws, leveraging frequency counts and set operations for clarity and correctness.",
