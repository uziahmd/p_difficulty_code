He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed that the string only contains 'a','b','c'\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the problem statement, because A appended some 'b's to a string with at least one 'a')\n 2. The process: \n    - Start with a string of one or more 'a's.\n    - Then append some 'b's (at least one).\n    - Then append some 'c's (the number of 'c's is either equal to the total number of 'a's OR the total number of 'b's OR both).\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: 'aabc' -> YES (because after the initial 'aa', then one 'b' (so now we have two a's and one b) then C appends 'c's: the number of c's should be either 2 (number of a's) or 1 (number of b's). In this case, there is one 'c'. So it matches the number of b's.\n\n But note: the order must be such that all 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's? Actually, the problem says:\n   - A has a string of some number of 'a's.\n   - B appends some number of 'b's to the end.\n   - C appends some number of 'c's to the end.\n\n Therefore, the string must be in non-decreasing order of the letters? Actually, the letters are fixed: 'a', then 'b', then 'c'. But note: what if there are no 'b's? The problem states that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist. So the string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and then the 'c's are appended.\n\n However, note that the example 'bbacc' is \"NO\". Why?\n   - The string is 'bbacc'. Let's break down:\n        Count of 'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 2.\n        The condition for C: the number of 'c' must be either 1 (the number of 'a') or 3 (the number of 'b'). Here, 2 is not equal to 1 or 3 -> so condition fails? But wait, the example says NO.\n\n However, the example output for 'bbacc' is 'NO'. But note the problem also says the order must be correct: meaning that the 'a's must come first, then 'b's, then 'c's. \n\n Let's check the order in 'bbacc': \n   The string starts with 'b', so there are no 'a's at the beginning? Actually, the problem says A gives a string of some number of 'a's, then B appends 'b's, then C appends 'c's. So the entire string must be in the form: [one or more 'a'] [one or more 'b'] [one or more 'c']? \n\n But note: the example 'aabc' is valid. In 'aabc': \n   'a' then 'a' then 'b' then 'c' -> but wait, the two 'a's are consecutive and then one 'b' and then one 'c'. This is acceptable.\n\n Now, for 'bbacc': \n   The string is: 'b','b','a','c','c'\n   There is an 'a' that comes after a 'b'. This violates the condition that the initial part is all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n Therefore, the conditions we must check:\n\n Condition 1: The string must be split into three contiguous parts: \n   Part1: one or more 'a's (if there are none, invalid)\n   Part2: one or more 'b's (if there are none, invalid)\n   Part3: one or more 'c's (if there are none, then the condition for C (which requires appending at least one 'c'? Actually, note: the problem says C appends some number of 'c's, which could be zero? But wait, the problem says \"equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'\", and if the number of 'c' is zero, then we require 0 == count_a or 0 == count_b. However, the problem states that the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So if we have zero 'c's, then we require either count_a==0 or count_b==0, but we know there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So zero 'c's would not be allowed. But wait, the problem does not explicitly say that C must append at least one 'c', but note: the condition is that the number of",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the following process: starting with a string of one or more 'a's, appending one or more 'b's, and then appending a number of 'c's equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the string must be in the correct order (all 'a's followed by all 'b's followed by all 'c's), and the count of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Order**: The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and end with one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like 'a's after 'b's or 'b's after 'c's) makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the order, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate C Count**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If both conditions are satisfied, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Check if the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'\n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check the order: all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's\n    parts = s.split('c')\n    if len(parts) != 3 or parts[0] == '' or parts[1] == '':\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Count the characters\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check the condition for the number of 'c's\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: The code first checks if the string contains at least one 'a' and one 'b'. If not, it immediately prints \"NO\" since the problem requires at least one of each.\n2. **Order Validation**: The string is split into parts using 'c' as the delimiter. If splitting results in more than three parts or any part before 'c' is empty (indicating 'a's or 'b's after 'c's), the string is invalid.\n3. **Character Counting**: The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are determined using the `count` method.\n4. **Final Validation**: The number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is met, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural and numerical conditions required for the string to be valid according to the problem's specifications.",
