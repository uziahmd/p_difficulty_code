Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting non-degenerate triangles (x, y, z) with integer sides such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nBut note: the condition is actually: \n   A <= x <= B and B <= y <= C and C <= z <= D.\n\nHowever, the triangle condition for sides (x, y, z) is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.\nBut note: the problem does not require the triangle to be acute or right, just non-degenerate (so strict inequality).\n\nBut note: the sides are constrained by ranges. We have:\n   x in [A, B]\n   y in [B, C]   (since B<=y<=C)\n   z in [C, D]\n\nAnd the triangle condition: \n   x + y > z\n   x + z > y   (which is automatically satisfied because z >= C >= y and x>=A>=1, so x+z >= 1+y, but we need to check the minimal case: actually, if x+z>y, but since x>=A, z>=C, and y<=C, then x+z >= A+C >= A+B (if A<=B) but wait, we have to be careful. However, note that the condition x+z>y is always true because x+z >= A+C and y<=C, and A>=1, so A+C >= 1+C >= C >= y. Similarly, y+z>x is also always true because y+z >= B+C (and B>=A, so at least A) and x<=B, so B+C >= x? Not exactly: we have x<=B, and y+z>=B+C. Since B+C >= B (because C>=B) and x<=B, then y+z>=B+C >= B >= x? Actually, no: if B+C is greater than x, but note that x<=B and y+z>=B+C, so y+z >= B+C >= B >= x? Actually, no: because B+C might be less than x? But wait, x<=B and B+C >= B, so y+z>=B+C >= B >= x? Actually, we have y+z >= B+C >= B >= x (since x<=B). So the other two conditions are automatically satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only condition we need to worry about is x+y>z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of triples (x,y,z) such that:\n   A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D, and x+y>z.\n\nWe can fix x and y and then count the number of z in [C, D] that are less than x+y.\n\nBut note: z must be at least C and at most D, and we require z < x+y.\n\nSo for fixed x and y, the valid z are in the interval [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\nBut note: if x+y-1 < C, then there are 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n   Let L = max(C, ...) but actually the lower bound is C and the upper bound is min(D, x+y-1). Then the count for z is: max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) if min(D, x+y-1) >= C, else 0.\n\nBut note: the ranges for x, y, z are large (up to 500000). So we cannot iterate over all x and y (which would be (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be up to 500000*500000, which is too slow).\n\nWe need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet's break down:\n\nWe have to count:\n   Sum_{x=A}^{B} Sum_{y=B}^{C} [number of z in [C, D] with z < x+y]\n\nWhich is the same as:\n   Sum_{x=A}^{B} Sum_{y=B}^{C} max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)\n\nBut note: the condition for z is z <= min(D, x+y-1) and z>=C.\n\nWe can change the order of summation or use mathematical functions.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the minimum and maximum of x+y and then use prefix sums.\n\nBut note: x from A to B, y from B to C, so x+y ranges from A+B to B+C.\n\nWe can consider the following:\n\nLet F(s) = the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y = s, with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C.\n\nThen, for each s from max(A+B, B+C_min?) to min(B+C, ?), but actually the smallest s is A+B (when x=A, y=B) and the largest s is B+C (when x=B, y=C).\n\nWait, actually: \n   x from A to B -> minimum x is A, maximum x is B.\n   y from B to C -> minimum y is B, maximum y is C.\n\nSo s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C.\n\nBut note: we are going to count for each s from s_min to s_max, the number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y=s.\n\nThen, for each s, the condition for z is: we require z < s, i.e., z in [C, min(D, s-1)]. The number of z for a given s is: \n   Let L_z = C, R_z = min(D, s-1)\n   Then if R_z < C, then 0; else (R_z - C + 1)\n\nThen the total count is:\n   For s from s_min to s_max:\n        count_s = number of (x,y) pairs with x+y=s (with constraints on x and y)\n        count_z(s) = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n\nThen total = sum_{s=s_min}^{s_max} [count_s * count_z(s)]\n\nBut note: the s_min and s_max might be large (from A+B to B+C, which could be up to 1e6, but the range is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) which is (C-A+1) and C-A can be up to 500000, so about 500000 values of s). \n\nNow, how to compute count_s for s from s_min to s_max?\n\nFor a fixed s, the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y=s, A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C is:\n\n   x must satisfy: max(A, s-C) <= x <= min(B, s-B)   [because y = s-x must be in [B, C] => s-x>=B => x<=s-B, and s-x<=C => x>=s-C]\n\nBut also x must be in [A, B].\n\nSo the x must be in [L, R] where:\n   L = max(A, s-C, s-C)   [actually, we have two conditions: x>=A and x>=s-C (from y<=C) and also x<=min(B, s-B) (from y>=B and x<=B)]\n   R = min(B, s-B)\n\nBut note: we also have y = s-x must be at least B and at most C, so:\n   s-x >= B  => x <= s-B\n   s-x <= C  => x >= s-C\n\nSo the condition for x is: max(A, s-C) <= x <= min(B, s-B)\n\nThen the count for s is: max(0, min(B, s-B) - max(A, s-C) + 1) if the lower bound <= the upper bound, else 0.\n\nBut note: the range of s is from s_min = A+B to s_max = B+C.\n\nHowever, note that for s < A+B, there are no pairs. Similarly, for s > B+C, no pairs.\n\nBut wait: what if s is less than A+B? Then the minimal x+y is A+B, so s_min = A+B. Similarly, s_max = B+C.\n\nSo we can iterate s from A+B to B+C.\n\nBut the range of s is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C - A + 1) which is at most 500000, so we can iterate over s.\n\nBut then, for each s, we do:\n   low_x = max(A, s-C)\n   high_x = min(B, s-B)\n\n   if low_x <= high_x:\n        count_s = high_x - low_x + 1\n   else:\n        count_s = 0\n\nThen, for each s, we add count_s * (number of z for s) = count_s * max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n\nBut wait: the total s from A+B to B+C is (C-A+1) which is about 500000, and then for each s we do a constant-time operation, so overall O(C-A) which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, note that the input constraints say A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, and the range of s is (C-A+1) which is at most 500000. So this is acceptable.\n\nBut wait: what if A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000? Then s_min = 1+500000=500001, s_max=500000+500000=1000000, so the range of s is from 500001 to 1000000, which is 500000 numbers. That is acceptable.\n\nBut note: in this example, we have to compute for each s from 500001 to 1000000 the count_s. How many pairs (x,y) for a given s?\n   x in [max(1, s-500000), min(500000, s-500000)]? Actually, wait: \n        y = s-x must be in [500000,500000] (since C=500000) so y=500000. Then x must be s-500000. And x must be in [1,500000]. So only one x per s, if s is between 1000000 and 1000000? Actually, for s=1000000, x=500000, which is valid. For s=500001, x=1, which is valid. But then the count_s for each s is 1 (if s is between 500001 and 1000000) but wait, no: for s=500001, x=1 and y=500000, which is valid. But then the next s=500002: x=2, y=499998? but y must be in [500000,500000] -> no, so wait, I think I messed up.\n\nActually, in the example: \n   A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000.\n\nBut the condition for y: B<=y<=C, i.e., 500000<=y<=500000 -> y must be 500000.\n\nSo for x+y = s, then y=500000, so x = s-500000. Then x must be in [A, B] i.e., [1,500000]. So s must be in [500001, 1000000] and for each s, x=s-500000 must be in [1,500000] -> s from 500001 to 1000000, but note: when s=500000, then x=0, which is invalid. So indeed, s from 500001 to 1000000.\n\nBut then, for each s, we have exactly one pair (x,y) = (s-500000, 500000). Then the condition for z: z in [500000, 500000] (since D=500000) and z < s. So we require z=500000 < s. So s must be >500000, which it is (s>=500001). Then the number of z is 1 for each s (because z must be 500000 and 500000< s). \n\nBut wait, the triangle condition is x+y>z: (s-500000)+500000 = s > 500000, which holds for s>=500001. So for each s from 500001 to 1000000, we have 1 triangle.\n\nBut note: x must be in [1,500000] and y=500000, so x from 1 to 500000 gives s from 500001 to 1000000. So the total triangles is (1000000-500001+1) = 500000.\n\nBut the example input was ['500000 500000 500000 500000'] and expected output is 1.\n\nWait, wait! The example input says: \"500000 500000 500000 500000\", meaning A=B=C=D=500000.\n\nThen the condition: A<=x<=B -> x=500000, B<=y<=C -> y=500000, C<=z<=D -> z=500000.\n\nThen the triple is (500000,500000,500000). Then we check: 500000+500000>500000 -> 1000000>500000 -> yes. So only one triangle.\n\nBut in our calculation above, we considered s from 500001 to 1000000, but in reality, when A=B=C=D=500000, then x is fixed to 500000, y fixed to 500000, and z fixed to 500000. Then s=x+y=1000000. Then we count for s=1000000: one pair (x,y) and then z must be <1000000, but z is 500000, so that is valid. But why did we get 500000 triangles above? \n\nAh, I see: the example I considered above (A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000) is different from the provided example. The provided example is A=B=C=D=500000.\n\nSo let me recast:\n\nIn the example A=B=C=D=500000, then:\n   x must be 500000, y must be 500000, z must be 500000.\n\nSo the triple is fixed. Then the triangle condition: 500000+500000>500000 -> yes.\n\nBut in the example A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000, then:\n   x from 1 to 500000, y=500000, z=500000.\n\nThen the condition: x+500000 > 500000 -> x>0, which is always true. So the number of triangles is the number of x from 1 to 500000, which is 500000.\n\nBut the problem states that the input is four integers A, B, C, D (with A<=B<=C<=D). In the example, we are given \"500000 500000 500000 500000\", so we are in the fixed case.\n\nSo the algorithm must account for the constraints.\n\nBut wait, in the example A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000, the condition for y is B<=y<=C, i.e., 500000<=y<=500000, so y is fixed. Similarly, the condition for x is A<=x<=B, i.e., 1<=x<=500000, and z is fixed to 500000.\n\nBut note: the condition for y is B<=y<=C, and in the input we have A<=B<=C<=D. So if B=C, then y is fixed. Similarly, if C=D, then z is fixed.\n\nBut in the general case, we cannot assume that the ranges for x,y,z are single points.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Read A, B, C, D.\n\n2. s_min = A+B, s_max = B+C.\n\n3. Initialize total = 0.\n\n4. For s from s_min to s_max:\n\n   a. Determine the range for x (and then y=s-x) such that:\n        x in [A, B] and y in [B, C] (which implies x in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)])\n\n   b. If the range for x is empty, skip.\n\n   c. Else, count_s = (min(B, s-B) - max(A, s-C) + 1)\n\n   d. Then, for the z part: we need to count the number of z in [C, D] such that z < s.\n\n        Let L_z = C, R_z = D (but we can't exceed D, and we require z < s, so the upper bound is min(D, s-1))\n\n        Then, if min(D, s-1) < C, then count_z = 0.\n        Else, count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n\n   e. Add count_s * count_z to total.\n\n5. Print total.\n\nBut wait, is this correct for the example A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000?\n\n   s_min = 1+500000 = 500001, s_max = 500000+500000=1000000.\n\n   For s=500001:\n        x in [max(1, 500001-500000)=max(1,1)=1, min(500000,500001-500000)=min(500000,1)=1] -> x=1, so count_s=1.\n        Then, count_z = min(500000, 500000) - 500000 + 1? Wait, no: the condition for z is z < s, i.e., z < 500001. Since z is in [500000,500000], then z=500000 <500001 -> valid. So count_z = 1.\n        Then add 1.\n\n   For s=500002:\n        x in [max(1,500002-500000)=max(1,2)=2, min(500000,500002-500000)=min(500000,2)=2] -> count_s=1.\n        count_z = 1 (same reason) -> add 1.\n\n   ... until s=1000000.\n\n   Then total = 1000000-500001+1 = 500000.\n\nBut the example input \"1 2 2 5\" (second example) should output 3.\n\nLet me test the second example: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nConditions: x in [1,2], y in [2,2] (so y=2), z in [2,5].\n\nTriangle condition: x+y>z -> x+2>z.\n\nWe have two choices for x: 1 and 2.\n\nFor x=1: then 1+2=3, so z must be <3 and >=2 -> z=2. So one triangle: (1,2,2)\n\nFor x=2: then 2+2=4, so z must be <4 and >=2 -> z=2,3. So two triangles: (2,2,2) and (2,2,3)\n\nTotal triangles: 3.\n\nNow, using our algorithm:\n\n   s_min = 1+2=3, s_max=2+2=4.\n\n   s=3:\n        x in [max(1, 3-2)=max(1,1)=1, min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1] -> count_s=1.\n        count_z: z in [2,5] and z<3 -> z=2. So count_z=1.\n        total += 1.\n\n   s=4:\n        x in [max(1,4-2)=max(1,2)=2, min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2] -> count_s=1.\n        count_z: z in [2,5] and z<4 -> z=2,3 -> count_z=2.\n        total += 1*2 = 2.\n\n   Total = 1+2 = 3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: first example input \"1 2 3 4\"\n\nExpected output: 4.\n\nConditions: x in [1,2], y in [2,3], z in [3,4].\n\nList the triangles:\n\n(1,3,3): 1+3>3 -> 4>3 -> yes.\n(2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> 4>3 -> yes.\n(2,3,3): 2+3>3 -> 5>3 -> yes.\n(2,3,4): 2+3>4 -> 5>4 -> yes.\n\nSo four.\n\nUsing the algorithm:\n\n   s_min = 1+2=3, s_max=2+3=5.\n\n   s=3:\n        x in [max(1,3-3)=max(1,0)=1, min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1] -> count_s=1.\n        count_z: z in [3,4] and z<3 -> none. So 0.\n\n   s=4:\n        x in [max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1, min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2] -> x from 1 to 2.\n            But wait, we have two possibilities: \n            Actually, we have two pairs: (1,3) and (2,2). But wait, the condition for y: y in [2,3] and for (1,3): y=3 is allowed (since 3<=3) and for (2,2): y=2 is allowed (since 2>=2). So two pairs.\n\n        How do we compute?\n            x_min = max(1,4-3)=1, x_max=min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2 -> count_s=2.\n\n        count_z: z in [3,4] and z<4 -> z=3 -> count_z=1.\n\n        total += 2*1 = 2.\n\n   s=5:\n        x in [max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2, min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2] -> count_s=1.\n        count_z: z in [3,4] and z<5 -> both 3 and 4. count_z=2.\n        total += 1*2 = 2.\n\n   Total = 0+2+2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to work.\n\nBut note: the example A=500000, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000:\n\n   s_min = 500000+500000=1000000, s_max=500000+500000=1000000.\n\n   s=1000000:\n        x in [max(500000,1000000-500000)=max(500000,500000)=500000, min(500000,1000000-500000)=min(500000,500000)=500000] -> count_s=1.\n        count_z: z in [500000,500000] and z<1000000 -> yes, so count_z=1.\n        total=1.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut note: the s_min and s_max are computed as A+B and B+C, and we iterate from s_min to s_max. The range of s is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1) which is at most 500000, so the loop runs at most 500000 times, which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, note that A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, so the maximum value of s is 500000+500000=1000000, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait: what if A=1, B=500000, C=500000, D=5000000? Then s_min=1+500000=500001, s_max=500000+500000=1000000. Then the loop runs from 500001 to 1000000 (about 500000 iterations) and for each s, we do two max and two min operations, then a subtraction and addition. This is O(1) per s, so total time is about 500000, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait: what if the range of s is very large? Actually, the range of s is (C-A+1) which is at most 500000 (since C>=B>=A, and C-A <= 500000-1=499999). So the loop runs at most 500000 times.\n\nBut note: the condition for the z part: we do min(D, s-1) and then subtract C. This is O(1) per s.\n\nTherefore, the code:\n\n   Read A, B, C, D.\n\n   s_min = A+B\n   s_max = B+C\n\n   total = 0\n\n   for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n        # Compute the valid x range: [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)]\n        low_x = max(A, s - C)\n        high_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n        if low_x > high_x:\n            count_s = 0\n        else:\n            count_s = high_x - low_x + 1\n\n        # Count the valid z for this s: z in [C, D] and z < s\n        # The smallest z is C, the largest z we can take is min(D, s-1)\n        if s-1 < C:\n            count_z = 0\n        else:\n            # We can take z from C to min(D, s-1)\n            high_z = min(D, s-1)\n            if high_z < C:\n                count_z = 0\n            else:\n                count_z = high_z - C + 1\n\n        total += count_s * count_z\n\n   print(total)\n\nBut wait, there is an alternative: we can compute the z part without branching twice. We can do:\n\n        if s-1 < C:\n            count_z = 0\n        else:\n            count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n\nBut note: if s-1 >= C, then we set count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1, but if min(D, s-1) < C, then that expression would be negative. However, we already checked that s-1>=C, so min(D, s-1) >= C? Not necessarily: if D < C, but the input condition is A<=B<=C<=D, so D>=C. Therefore, min(D, s-1) is at least min(C, s-1). But wait, we know s>=s_min=A+B>=A+B (which is at least 2, but more importantly, we have s_min=A+B, and we know A>=1, B>=A, so s_min>=2). And we have s>=s_min, and we are checking s-1>=C. \n\nBut note: the condition for z: z must be at least C. So if s-1 < C, then no z. Otherwise, the smallest z is C and the largest z is min(D, s-1). Since D>=C, then min(D, s-1) is at least C only if s-1>=C? Actually, no: if s-1>=C, then min(D, s-1) is at least C? Not necessarily: if D < s-1, then min(D, s-1)=D, and we know D>=C, so yes. If s-1 < D, then min(D, s-1)=s-1, and we know s-1>=C (from the condition) so then s-1>=C and s-1 is the upper bound. So the expression is safe.\n\nBut wait: the input condition is A<=B<=C<=D, so D>=C. Therefore, we can write:\n\n        if s-1 < C:\n            count_z = 0\n        else:\n            count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n\nThis is correct.\n\nBut note: what if D < C? Then the condition A<=B<=C<=D wouldn't hold, so we don't have to worry.\n\nLet me test with the examples:\n\nExample1: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5 -> s=3: count_z = min(5,2) - 2 + 1 = 2-2+1=1 -> correct.\nExample2: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4 -> s=3: count_z = min(4,2) - 3 + 1 -> wait, 2-3+1=0 -> correct (as above).\n\nBut wait, in the first example of the problem: \"1 2 3 4\", we have:\n\n   s=3: count_z = min(4,2)-3+1 -> 2-3+1=0 -> correct.\n   s=4: min(4,3)-3+1=3-3+1=1 -> correct.\n   s=5: min(4,4)-3+1=4-3+1=2 -> correct.\n\nBut wait, in the example A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, s_min=3, s_max=5.\n\nBut note: the condition for y: y in [B, C] = [2,3]. Then for s=5: x+y=5, with x in [1,2] and y in [2,3]. Then x=2, y=3. Then z in [3,4] and z<5 -> [3,4] -> two values.\n\nBut the above formula for s=5: count_z = min(4,4)-3+1=4-3+1=2 -> correct.\n\nNow, let's try a tricky one: A=1, B=3, C=4, D=10.\n\nWhat are the triangles?\n\nConditions: \n   x in [1,3], y in [3,4], z in [4,10].\n\nTriangle condition: x+y>z.\n\nWe can list:\n\nx=1: y can be 3 or 4 -> \n   (1,3,z): 1+3=4 -> z must be <4 -> but z>=4 -> no z? because 4 is not <4. So no.\n   (1,4,z): 1+4=5 -> z must be <5 -> z=4. So one triangle: (1,4,4)\n\nx=2: \n   (2,3,z): 2+3=5 -> z in [4,4] (since <5) -> z=4 -> one triangle: (2,3,4)\n   (2,4,z): 2+4=6 -> z in [4,5] (since <6) -> z=4,5 -> two triangles: (2,4,4) and (2,4,5)\n\nx=3:\n   (3,3,z): 3+3=6 -> z in [4,5] -> two triangles: (3,3,4) and (3,3,5)\n   (3,4,z): 3+4=7 -> z in [4,6] -> three triangles: (3,4,4), (3,4,5), (3,4,6)\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+2+3 = 9.\n\nNow, using the algorithm:\n\n   s_min=1+3=4, s_max=3+4=7.\n\n   s=4:\n        x in [max(1,4-4)=max(1,0)=1, min(3,4-3)=min(3,1)=1] -> count_s=1.\n        count_z = min(10,3)-4+1 -> but wait, s=4: then z must be <4 -> but z>=4, so no z. But wait, condition for z: z in [4,10] and z<4 -> none. So count_z=0.\n\n   s=5:\n        x in [max(1,5-4)=max(1,1)=1, min(3,5-3)=min(3,2)=2] -> x from 1 to 2 -> count_s=2.\n        count_z = min(10,4)-4+1 = 4-4+1=1.\n\n        total += 2*1 = 2.\n\n   s=6:\n        x in [max(1,6-4)=max(1,2)=2, min(3,6-3)=min(3,3)=3] -> x from 2 to 3 -> count_s=2.\n        count_z = min(10,5)-4+1 = 5-4+1=2.\n\n        total += 2*2 = 4.\n\n   s=7:\n        x in [max(1,7-4)=max(1,3)=3, min(3,7-3)=min(3,4)=3] -> count_s=1.\n        count_z = min(10,6)-4+1 = 6-4+",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is strictly greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we can simplify the problem by recognizing that the only condition we need to enforce is \\(x + y > z\\), as the other conditions are automatically satisfied due to the ranges of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) is in \\([A, B]\\), \\(y\\) is in \\([B, C]\\), and \\(z\\) is in \\([C, D]\\), and \\(x + y > z\\). The key observation is that for any valid \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), the condition \\(x + z > y\\) and \\(y + z > x\\) will always hold true given the ranges of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). Thus, we only need to ensure \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible sum \\(s = x + y\\) (where \\(s\\) ranges from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\)), we determine the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) that result in this sum. For each such pair, we then count the number of valid \\(z\\) values in \\([C, D]\\) that are less than \\(s\\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate over all possible sums \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\).\n   - For each \\(s\\), compute the range of \\(x\\) values that satisfy \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\) and \\(B \\leq s - x \\leq C\\). This translates to \\(x\\) being in \\([max(A, s - C), min(B, s - B)]\\).\n   - If there are valid \\(x\\) values, the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) for this \\(s\\) is the count of integers in the computed range.\n   - For each valid \\(s\\), the number of valid \\(z\\) values is the count of integers in \\([C, min(D, s - 1)]\\).\n   - Multiply the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) by the number of valid \\(z\\) values and accumulate the result.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm iterates over \\(O(C - A)\\) values of \\(s\\), each requiring constant time operations. Since \\(C - A\\) can be up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\), the solution efficiently handles the constraints with a linear pass through the possible sums.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    s_min = A + B\n    s_max = B + C\n    \n    total_triangles = 0\n\n    for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n        low_x = max(A, s - C)\n        high_x = min(B, s - B)\n        \n        if low_x > high_x:\n            count_s = 0\n        else:\n            count_s = high_x - low_x + 1\n            \n        if s - 1 < C:\n            count_z = 0\n        else:\n            high_z = min(D, s - 1)\n            count_z = high_z - C + 1\n            \n        total_triangles += count_s * count_z\n        \n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) read from standard input.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The minimum and maximum possible sums \\(s\\) of \\(x + y\\) are calculated as \\(A + B\\) and \\(B + C\\), respectively.\n3. **Iterating Over Sums**: For each sum \\(s\\) from \\(s_{min}\\) to \\(s_{max}\\):\n   - **Determine Valid \\(x\\) Values**: The valid \\(x\\) values must satisfy \\(A \\leq x \\leq B\\) and \\(B \\leq s - x \\leq C\\). This is translated into a range for \\(x\\) using `max(A, s - C)` and `min(B, s - B)`.\n   - **Count Valid Pairs \\((x, y)\\)**: The number of valid \\(x\\) values gives the count of pairs \\((x, y)\\) for the current sum \\(s\\).\n   - **Count Valid \\(z\\) Values**: The valid \\(z\\) values must be in \\([C, D]\\) and less than \\(s\\). The upper bound for \\(z\\) is the minimum of \\(D\\) and \\(s - 1\\).\n4. **Accumulate Results**: The product of the counts of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) and valid \\(z\\) values is added to the total.\n5. **Output Result**: The total number of valid triangles is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking each possible sum \\(s\\) and leveraging simple arithmetic to count valid configurations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
