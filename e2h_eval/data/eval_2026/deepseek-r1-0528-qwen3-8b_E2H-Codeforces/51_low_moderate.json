Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from standard input.\n The idea is:\n 1. Combine the first two strings (guest name and host name) and count the total frequency of each letter.\n 2. Compare the total frequency with the frequency of letters in the third string (the pile).\n 3. If the frequencies match exactly, then we output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n However, note: the problem says that the pile must be exactly the letters from the two names (without extra letters).\n\n Steps:\n - Read the three lines.\n - Concatenate the first two lines (strip newline characters).\n - Count the frequency of each character in the concatenated string and in the third string.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n      SANTACLAUS\n      DEDMOROZ\n      SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   We combine \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" and compare with \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n But note: the example input is given as a list of three strings in the example, but the actual input is three lines.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Let's do:\n\n   s1 = first line (guest)\n   s2 = second line (host)\n   s3 = third line (pile)\n\n   total_letters = s1 + s2\n   sorted_total_letters = sorted(total_letters)   # or use collections.Counter\n\n   pile_letters = s3\n\n   Then check if sorted(total_letters) == sorted(pile_letters)\n\n However, note: the example input has multiple test cases? Actually, the example shows multiple outputs for one input?\n\n But looking at the example:\n\n   Input: ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...] \n\n   This is actually a list of three test cases? But wait, the problem says:\n\n   Input: three lines.\n\n   And the example output is: ['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n   So there are three separate test cases? Or is it one test case with three parts?\n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"The input file consists of three lines\"\n\n   But then the example input is given as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS',\n         'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI',\n         'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This suggests that the entire input is three lines, but the example input is provided as a list of three strings, each string containing three lines? \n\n   Actually, let me read the problem again: \n\n        The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile.\n\n   So the example input is actually three separate inputs? Or is the example input a single string that contains three lines?\n\n   The example input format is:\n\n        Line 1: guest name\n        Line 2: host name\n        Line 3: pile\n\n   But the example provided in the problem is:\n\n        Input: \n          ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', \n           'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', \n           'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   This seems to be three different examples, but the problem states:\n\n        The input file consists of three lines.\n\n   So actually, we are to read three lines from stdin.\n\n   However, the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string having three lines? That doesn't fit.\n\n   Let me clarify: the problem says \"The input file consists of three lines\". So we have one test case.\n\n   But then the example output is three letters: ['YES','NO','NO'].\n\n   Wait, the example input is provided as:\n\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n   This is confusing. Actually, looking at the example, it's showing three separate examples, but the problem says:\n\n        Example Input\n        ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\\nPAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\\nBABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n   No, the example input is given as a list of three strings, each string being a concatenation of three lines?\n\n   Actually, the problem statement says:\n\n        The following",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the frequency of each letter in the combined names matches the frequency of each letter in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read three lines from the input, which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Frequency Comparison**: Compare the frequency of each character in the combined names with the frequency of each character in the pile. If both frequencies match exactly, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    total_letters = guest + host\n    counter_total = Counter(total_letters)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    print(\"YES\" if counter_total == counter_pile else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three lines of input: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string `total_letters`.\n3. **Frequency Counting**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, the program counts the occurrences of each character in `total_letters` and in the pile.\n4. **Comparison**: The program checks if the character counts from the combined names match those from the pile. If they do, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies whether the pile contains exactly the required letters by leveraging frequency counting, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum input size.",
