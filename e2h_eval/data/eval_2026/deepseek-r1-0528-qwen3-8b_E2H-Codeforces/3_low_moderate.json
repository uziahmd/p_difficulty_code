Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to solve the problem by considering the gaps between lanterns and the ends.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the list of lantern positions.\n 2. The entire street must be covered from 0 to l.\n 3. Consider two parts: \n    a) The left end: from 0 to the first lantern.\n    b) The right end: from the last lantern to l.\n    c) The gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n 4. For the left end: we need at least (first lantern's position) / 2 to light from 0.\n    Why? Because if the first lantern is at position x, then we need a radius d such that d >= x - 0, but note: \n        Actually, the lantern at x lights from (x-d) to (x+d). To cover 0, we require x-d <= 0 -> d>=x. However, wait: \n        But note that the lantern might not be at 0. Actually, we can have a gap from 0 to the first lantern at a0.\n\n    Actually, the condition for covering the left end is that the leftmost point (0) must be within d of the first lantern.\n        So: d >= a0 - 0 = a0.\n\n    But wait: what if the first lantern is at 0? Then d>=0. However, we might also consider the middle gaps.\n\n 5. Similarly, for the right end: d must be at least (l - last_lantern) so that the last lantern covers up to l.\n\n 6. For the gaps between consecutive lanterns: \n    Consider two consecutive lanterns at positions a_i and a_{i+1}. The gap between them is (a_{i+1} - a_i).\n    To cover this gap, the two lanterns together must have a combined coverage that spans the entire gap. \n    The minimal d for this gap would be the half of the gap? Actually, we require that the right side of the left lantern (a_i + d) meets the left side of the next lantern (a_{i+1} - d) at least in the middle.\n\n    Actually, the condition is that the distance between the two lanterns should be covered by the two radii: \n        d + d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i)\n    Therefore, d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2.\n\n 7. However, note that the same d is used for every lantern. Therefore, the minimum d required is the maximum among:\n    - The left end requirement: d1 = a0\n    - The right end requirement: d2 = l - a[-1]\n    - The gaps between consecutive lanterns: d_gap = (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2 for each i\n\n 8. But wait: is that correct? Let me test with the example: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n    n=2, l=5, lanterns at [2,5] (already sorted)\n\n    Left end: 0 to 2 -> requires d >= 2 (so that the first lantern covers from 0 to 4)\n    Right end: 5 to 5 -> requires d >= 5-5 = 0\n    Gap: 5-2 = 3, so d_gap = 3/2 = 1.5\n\n    Then the answer would be max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2.0 -> which matches the sample.\n\n    However, let's check the sample: ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0'] -> sorted: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n    Left end: 0 (so d must be at least 0) -> no requirement from left.\n    Right end: 15-15 = 0 -> no requirement from right.\n    Now gaps:\n        3-0 = 3 -> d_gap = 1.5\n        5-3 = 2 -> d_gap = 1.0\n        7-5 = 2 -> d_gap = 1.0\n        9-7 = 2 -> d_gap = 1.0\n        14-9 = 5 -> d_gap = 2.5\n        15-14 = 1 -> d_gap = 0.5\n\n    Then the answer would be max(0, 0, 1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.5, 0.5) = 2.5 -> which matches.\n\n 9. But wait: is that really correct for the middle gaps? \n\n    Consider two lanterns",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` required for all lanterns on a street to illuminate the entire street. The street is represented as a straight line from 0 to `l`, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: The first step is to sort the positions of the lanterns in ascending order. This helps in systematically analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check End Conditions**: The street has two ends (0 and `l`). The leftmost end requires that the first lantern's position must be within `d` of 0, so `d` must be at least the position of the first lantern. Similarly, the rightmost end requires that the last lantern's position must be within `d` of `l`, so `d` must be at least `l` minus the position of the last lantern.\n3. **Analyze Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the distance between them must be covered by the combined light radii of the two lanterns. Specifically, the sum of the radii from each lantern to the midpoint between them should cover the gap. Thus, the required `d` for each gap is half the distance between the two lanterns.\n4. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The overall minimum radius `d` is the maximum value among the requirements from the left end, the right end, and all the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = float(data[1])\n    positions = list(map(float, data[2:2+n]))\n    positions.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(l/2.0))\n        return\n        \n    # Left end\n    first_gap = positions[0] - 0\n    max_d = max(max_d, first_gap)\n    \n    # Right end\n    last_gap = l - positions[-1]\n    max_d = max(max_d, last_gap)\n    \n    # Middle gaps\n    for i in range(len(positions)-1):\n        gap = positions[i+1] - positions[i]\n        required = gap / 2.0\n        if required > max_d:\n            max_d = required\n            \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate the analysis of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If there are no lanterns (`n == 0`), the entire street must be illuminated by a single lantern with radius `l/2`.\n4. **Left and Right Ends**: The left end requires `d` to be at least the distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (0). The right end requires `d` to be at least the distance from the end of the street (`l`) to the last lantern.\n5. **Middle Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required `d` is half the distance between them. The maximum value among all these requirements gives the minimal `d` needed to illuminate the entire street.\n6. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's accuracy requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all critical segments of the street (ends and gaps between lanterns) to determine the minimal light radius required, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
