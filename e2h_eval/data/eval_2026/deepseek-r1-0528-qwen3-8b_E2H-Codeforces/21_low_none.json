The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j is odd. This means that one must be even and the other odd.\n\n Therefore, we can separate the chests into two groups:\n   Group 0 (even): chests with even numbers.\n   Group 1 (odd): chests with odd numbers.\n\n Similarly, separate the keys:\n   Group 0 (even): keys with even numbers.\n   Group 1 (odd): keys with odd numbers.\n\n Then, note:\n   - An even chest can only be opened by an odd key (because even + odd = odd).\n   - An odd chest can only be opened by an even key (because odd + even = odd).\n\n So, the problem reduces to matching between two bipartite graphs:\n\n   Graph 1: Even chests (from input) and Odd keys (from input)\n   Graph 2: Odd chests (from input) and Even keys (from input)\n\n But note: we cannot use the same key twice, so we have two independent matchings.\n\n However, we cannot mix the two because the conditions are exclusive.\n\n Therefore, the maximum number of chests we can open is the sum of the maximum matching in both bipartite graphs.\n\n But note: In a bipartite graph, the maximum matching for a complete bipartite graph with two sets (A and B) is min(|A|, |B|) if there's no restriction? \n However, wait: in our case, every chest in one group is compatible with every key in the opposite parity group? \n\n Actually, the condition is purely based on parity. So any even chest can be opened by any odd key, and any odd chest by any even key.\n\n So the bipartite graphs are complete from one set to the other.\n\n Then the maximum matching for the first bipartite graph (even chests and odd keys) is min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count).\n Similarly, the second bipartite graph (odd chests and even keys) is min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count).\n\n However, wait: is that really the case? Let me check with the example.\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \n        n=5, m=4\n        Chests: [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] -> even: [14,6,2] (3), odd: [9,11] (2)\n        Keys: [8,4,7,20] -> even: [8,4,20] (3), odd: [7] (1)\n\n   Then by the above, the matching for even_chest and odd_key: min(3,1)=1\n        for odd_chest and even_key: min(2,3)=2\n        total = 3 -> matches the example.\n\n Example 2:\n        n=5, m=1\n        Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even: 5\n        Keys: [5] -> odd: 1\n\n        Matching for even_chest and odd_key: min(5,1)=1\n        Matching for odd_chest and even_key: min(0,0)=0 (since there are 0 odd chests and 0 even keys)\n        total = 1 -> matches.\n\n Example 3:\n        n=1, m=4\n        Chest: [10] -> even:1, odd:0\n        Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even:4, odd:0\n\n        Matching for even_chest and odd_key: min(1,0)=0\n        Matching for odd_chest and even_key: min(0,4)=0\n        total=0 -> matches.\n\n But wait, what if we have more than one way to assign? Actually, we are just counting the maximum matching in two independent bipartite graphs. Since the graph is complete, then the maximum matching is indeed the minimum of the two set sizes.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the keys and chests are distinct beyond the counts. Since each key can open any chest of the opposite parity, then we can use up to min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) for the first matching and min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count) for the second.\n\n Therefore, the answer is simply:\n   even_chests = count of even numbers in the chest array\n   odd_chests = n - even_chests\n\n   even_keys = count of even numbers in the key array\n   odd_keys = m - even_keys\n\n   result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n But wait, is there a catch? The problem says one key can open at most one chest and vice versa. However, we are not using the same key for two purposes, and we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can be opened by a key only if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This condition implies that one must be even and the other odd. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching chests and keys such that each chest is opened by exactly one key, and each key is used at most once. The compatibility between a chest and a key is determined by their parity (even or odd). Specifically:\n   - An even-numbered chest can only be opened by an odd-numbered key.\n   - An odd-numbered chest can only be opened by an even-numbered key.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves categorizing both chests and keys into even and odd groups. The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of:\n   - The minimum of the count of even chests and the count of odd keys.\n   - The minimum of the count of odd chests and the count of even keys.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves counting the number of even and odd chests and keys. The solution then computes the two minima mentioned above and sums them up. This approach efficiently leverages the complete bipartite nature of the problem (any even chest matches any odd key, and vice versa) to derive the solution in linear time.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each chest and key exactly once to count their parities, resulting in a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is optimal for the given constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n            \n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n            \n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Chests**: The code counts how many chests have even numbers (`even_chests`) and how many have odd numbers (`odd_chests`).\n3. **Counting Even and Odd Keys**: Similarly, the code counts even and odd keys (`even_keys` and `odd_keys` respectively).\n4. **Calculating Maximum Openings**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by summing the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys. This gives the total number of compatible pairs.\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests Neko can open under the given constraints. \n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks and simple arithmetic to solve the problem within optimal time complexity.",
