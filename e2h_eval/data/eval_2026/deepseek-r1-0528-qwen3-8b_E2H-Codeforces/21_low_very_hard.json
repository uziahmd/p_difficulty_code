The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are going to use the condition: a_i + b_j ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n This means that if a_i is even, then we need a key with odd integer (b_j) to open it.\n Similarly, if a_i is odd, then we need a key with even integer (b_j) to open it.\n\n Let:\n   Chests: \n        even_chest = number of chests with even a_i\n        odd_chest = number of chests with odd a_i\n\n   Keys:\n        even_key = number of keys with even b_j\n        odd_key = number of keys with odd b_j\n\n But note: The condition for a chest of even a_i requires an odd key, and for odd a_i requires an even key.\n\n However, we cannot use one key more than once. So we have two types of matching:\n\n   Type 1: Use even keys for odd-chests.\n   Type 2: Use odd keys for even-chests.\n\n But wait: what if there are more chests of one type than the available keys of the complementary type?\n Then we can only open as many as the minimum between the two.\n\n However, note: There are two independent sets of requirements.\n\n Actually, the problem becomes: we have two bipartite graphs (or two independent matching problems):\n\n   - Even keys can only match with odd-chests (because even + odd = odd? Actually: even + odd = odd, which is 1 mod 2 -> yes)\n   - Odd keys can only match with even-chests (because odd + even = odd, which is 1 mod 2)\n\n But note: the condition is defined by the sum being odd. \n\n However, we can also consider: the entire set of keys must be partitioned into two sets: even and odd.\n\n And the entire set of chests must be partitioned into two sets: even and odd.\n\n Then the maximum matching is:\n\n   total = min(even_chest, odd_key)   [matching even-chests with odd keys]\n          + min(odd_chest, even_key)   [matching odd-chests with even keys]\n\n Why? Because the even keys are only useful for odd-chests, and the odd keys are only useful for even-chests.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Chests: [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] -> \n        even_chest: 14,6,2 -> 3\n        odd_chest: 9,11 -> 2\n\n   Keys: [8,4,7,20] ->\n        even_key: 8,4,20 -> 3\n        odd_key: 7 -> 1\n\n   Then:\n        even_chest matched with odd_key: min(3,1) = 1\n        odd_chest matched with even_key: min(2,3) = 2\n        total = 1+2 = 3.\n\n Another example: \n   Input: \"5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5\"\n        Chests: [2,4,6,8,10] -> all even -> even_chest=5, odd_chest=0\n        Keys: [5] -> odd_key=1, even_key=0\n        Then: \n            even_chest matched with odd_key: min(5,1)=1\n            odd_chest matched with even_key: min(0,0)=0\n        Total = 1.\n\n Another example: \n   Input: \"1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50\"\n        Chests: [10] -> even_chest=1, odd_chest=0\n        Keys: [20,30,40,50] -> all even -> even_key=4, odd_key=0\n        Then: even_chest matched with odd_key: min(1,0)=0; odd_chest matched with even_key: min(0,4)=0 -> total 0.\n\n Therefore, the solution is straightforward.\n\n Steps:\n   Read n, m.\n   Read the list of n integers for the chests.\n   Read the list of m integers for the keys.\n\n   Count:\n      even_chest = count of numbers in the chest list that are even (a_i % 2 == 0)\n      odd_chest = n - even_chest\n\n      even_key = count of numbers in the key list that are even (b_j % 2 == 0)\n      odd_key = m - even_key\n\n   Then the answer is: min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\n Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can be opened only if the sum of its number and the key's number is odd. This condition translates to specific pairing requirements between the chests and keys based on their parity (even or odd).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - A chest with an even number can only be opened by a key with an odd number (since even + odd = odd).\n   - A chest with an odd number can only be opened by a key with an even number (since odd + even = odd).\n   - Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - We categorize the chests into two groups: those with even numbers and those with odd numbers.\n   - Similarly, we categorize the keys into those with even numbers and those with odd numbers.\n   - The solution involves matching even-numbered chests with odd-numbered keys and odd-numbered chests with even-numbered keys, limited by the smaller count in each category.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Count the number of even and odd chests.\n   - Count the number of even and odd keys.\n   - The maximum number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The algorithm processes each chest and key exactly once to count their parities, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n + m), where n is the number of chests and m is the number of keys. This is efficient for the given constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    ans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by their respective numbers.\n- **Counting Parities**: The code counts how many chests have even and odd numbers, and similarly for the keys.\n- **Matching Calculation**: The solution calculates the maximum number of chests that can be opened by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys, taking the minimum of each category's counts.\n- **Output**: The result is printed, which is the sum of the two minimum values obtained from the matching process.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the parity conditions to maximize the number of chests opened without exceeding the available keys, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
