A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. They have k bottles -> total drink = k * l milliliters.\n For a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. But note: the toasts are for the entire group? Actually, the problem says:\n \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. But they all drink the same amount.\n\n However, note: the example calculation: \n   Input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n   Drink: 4*5 = 20 ml -> enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (since each toast requires 3 ml for one friend? but wait: the requirement is per friend per toast)\n\n Let me clarify: \n   The problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt\" to make one toast.\n\n But then, if we are making toasts for the entire group, and each friend must have the same number of toasts, then for T toasts per friend, we need:\n   - Drink: n * T * nl milliliters (because each of the n friends makes T toasts, and each toast requires nl ml)\n   - Lime: n * T slices (each toast requires one slice, and each friend makes T toasts so each friend uses T slices; total slices available: c * d)\n   - Salt: n * T * np grams\n\n However, wait: the example says:\n   Overall drink: 20 ml, which is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But note: 3 friends, so if we do 2 toasts per friend, that's 3*2=6 toasts. \n\n So actually, the total number of toasts is T * n (because each of the n friends makes T toasts). Then:\n\n   Total drink needed: T * n * nl <= k * l\n   Total lime slices needed: T * n <= c * d\n   Total salt needed: T * n * np <= p\n\n Therefore, the maximum T (toasts per friend) is the minimum value of:\n   T1 = (k * l) / (n * nl)   [from drink]\n   T2 = (c * d) / (n)        [from lime]\n   T3 = p / (n * np)         [from salt]\n\n But note: T must be an integer and we take the floor (since we can't have a fraction of a toast).\n\n However, the example calculation does:\n   Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 (which is the requirement for one toast for one friend? But wait, the requirement for one toast for one friend is nl=3 ml. \n   But in the example, they are considering the total toasts as 6, which is 20/3. Then they divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   The total number of toasts (for the whole group) is limited by:\n      T_total = min( (k*l) // (nl), (c*d) // 1, p // (np) )   [but wait, for drink: each toast requires nl ml for one friend, but note: one toast is for one friend? Actually, no: the problem says each toast requires nl milliliters for one friend. So if we have T_total toasts (across the whole group), then we have to account for the fact that these toasts are distributed among n friends. \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for one toast. So if we are making T toasts per friend, then the total drink required is T * n * nl.\n\n Therefore, the constraints are:\n   T * n * nl <= k * l   => T <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n   T * n <= c * d        => T <= (c * d) / n\n   T * n * np <= p       => T <= p / (n * np)\n\n Then T_max = floor(min( (k*l)/(n*nl), (c*d)/n, p/(n*np) ))\n\n However, note: the example input: n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n   Drink: (4*5) = 20 -> T <= 20/(3*3) = 20/9 ≈ 2.22 -> floor gives 2\n   Lime: (10*8)=80 -> T <= 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> floor gives 26\n   Salt: 100/(3*1)= 33.33 -> floor gives 33\n\n Then T_max = min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n But the example output is 2.\n\n However, note: the example explanation says: \n   \"min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2\"\n\n What are 6, 80, 100?\n   Drink: 20 ml / 3 ml per toast (for one friend) but wait, the example explanation says: \n        \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\"\n   This 6 is the total number of toasts (if we consider that one toast uses 3 ml, but note: one toast for one friend uses 3 ml. \n   However, if we have multiple friends, then the same toast cannot be shared? Actually, each toast is for one friend. \n\n   But note: the total number of toasts we can make is limited by the drink: 20 ml / 3 ml per toast (each toast being for one friend) -> 6 toasts in total for the entire group? \n   However, there are 3 friends, and each toast is for one friend. So we cannot have more than 6 toasts in total.\n\n   Then, if we have 6 toasts in total, and 3 friends, then each friend gets 6/3 = 2 toasts.\n\n   Similarly, the lime: total slices available is 80. Each toast requires one slice (and there are 80 slices) so 80 toasts in total. Then 80/3 ≈ 26.66 -> each friend can have up to 26 toasts? But wait, the lime constraint is independent of the drink.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\", meaning each toast (per friend) requires one slice.\n\n   So the total number of toasts (across the entire group) is the limiting factor from drink, lime, and salt.\n\n   We can compute the total toasts T_total as:\n        T_total_drink = (k * l) // nl   [if we ignore the fact that each toast is for one friend? But wait: the requirement is for one friend, so if we use the drink for multiple friends, we need to account for the entire group]\n\n   Actually, let's reframe: \n        One toast (for one friend) requires: nl ml, 1 slice, np grams of salt.\n\n   Therefore, the entire group's requirement for T_total toasts (where each toast is assigned to one friend) is:\n        Drink: T_total * nl\n        Lime: T_total (each toast requires one slice)\n        Salt: T_total * np\n\n   And note: the friends are n, but the total toasts T_total must be at least the number of toasts per friend times n? Actually, no: because the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for one toast. So if a friend makes t_i toasts, then that friend uses t_i * nl ml and t_i slices. The condition is that each friend must have the same number of toasts, say T. Then the total toasts is T * n.\n\n   Therefore, we can also express the constraints in terms of T (toasts per friend):\n\n        Drink: T * n * nl <= k * l\n        Lime: T * n <= c * d\n        Salt: T * n * np <= p\n\n   Then T_max = floor(min( (k*l)/(n*nl), (c*d)/n, p/(n*np) ))\n\n   But note: the example uses the total toasts (without breaking down by friend) and then divides by n? Actually, the example did:\n\n        Drink: total toasts from drink perspective (if we consider each toast requiring 3 ml) is 20/3 ≈ 6. Then they divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2.\n\n   This is equivalent to: \n        T_max = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )   [using integer division?] \n\n   However, note: the constraints might not be integers. We should use floor division? But the problem says the numbers are positive integers and we are to output an integer.\n\n   But the example calculation in the problem used floating point and then floor? Actually, the example did:\n\n        Drink: 20/3 = 6.66... but then they took 6 (floor) for the total toasts? Then divided by n=3 -> 2.\n\n   However, if we do:\n\n        total_toasts = min( (k*l) // nl, (c*d), p // np )   [if we were to use the total toasts without considering friends] \n\n   But wait, the requirement for drink for one toast (one friend) is nl, so the total toasts (across the entire group) cannot exceed (k*l) // nl? Actually, no: because the drink is used by the entire group. Each toast (one friend) uses nl ml, so the total toasts (counting each friend's toast individually) is (k*l) // nl. Then the number of toasts per friend is (k*l)//nl divided by n, but only if we don't exceed the other constraints.\n\n   Actually, we can think:\n\n        Let T_total be the total number of toasts (each toast is for one friend, so T_total = n * T).\n\n        Constraints:\n            T_total * nl <= k * l   => T_total <= (k*l) / nl\n            T_total <= c*d           (because each toast requires one slice, and we have c*d slices)\n            T_total * np <= p        => T_total <= p / np\n\n        Then T_total_max = min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np )   [but using integer division? Actually, we are dealing in whole toasts]\n\n        However, note: the drink constraint: we can only use whole toasts, so we take floor of (k*l)/nl.\n\n        But wait: (k*l) might not be divisible by nl. Example: k*l=20, nl=3 -> 20//3 = 6 (if integer division) or 6.66... (if float). Since we can't have a fraction of a toast, we take the floor.\n\n        Similarly, for salt: p//np (integer division) if p is not divisible by np, then we take floor.\n\n        Then T_total_max = min( (k*l) // nl, c*d, p // np )   [but wait: the salt constraint is T_total * np <= p -> T_total <= p // np? Actually, if we use integer division, then p//np is the maximum integer T_total such that T_total * np <= p.\n\n        However, note: the lime constraint is T_total <= c*d (because each toast requires one slice, and we have c*d slices).\n\n        Then the toasts per friend T = T_total_max // n   [because we have n friends, and the total toasts must be distributed equally?]\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters, a slice and np grams\" for one toast. And they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\n\n        So the total toasts T_total must be divisible by n? Not necessarily, because we can have some friends having one less toast? \n\n        However, the problem says \"each friend needs\" for one toast. And they want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\n\n        This means: we are to find the maximum integer T (toasts per friend) such that:\n\n            T * n * nl <= k * l\n            T * n <= c * d\n            T * n * np <= p\n\n        So T_max = min( (k*l) // (n*nl), (c*d) // n, p // (n*np) )\n\n        But note: integer division in Python for positive numbers is the same as floor division.\n\n        However, let me check with the example:\n\n            n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\n            Drink: (k*l) = 20, n*nl=9 -> 20//9 = 2 (if we use integer division) but wait, 20//9 is 2 in integer division (floor).\n\n            Lime: (c*d) = 80, n=3 -> 80//3 = 26 (integer division)\n\n            Salt: p=100, n*np=3 -> 100//3 = 33 (integer division)\n\n            Then T_max = min(2, 26, 33) = 2.\n\n        Another example: \n            Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n\n            n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\n            Drink: (100*10) = 1000, n*nl=5*4=20 -> 1000//20 = 50\n            Lime: (1*19)=19, n=5 -> 19//5 = 3\n            Salt: 90, n*np=5*3=15 -> 90//15=6\n\n            Then T_max = min(50,3,6)=3.\n\n            Output: 3, which matches the sample.\n\n        Third example:\n            Input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n\n            n=10, k=1000, l=1000, c=25, d=23, p=1, nl=50, np=1.\n\n            Drink: 1000*1000 = 1000000, n*nl=10*50=500 -> 1000000//500 = 2000\n            Lime: 25*23=575, n=10 -> 575//10 = 57\n            Salt: 1, n*np=10*1=10 -> 1//10 = 0\n\n            Then T_max = 0.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n            drink_limit = (k * l) // (n * nl)   # toasts per friend from drink: (total drink) / (drink per friend per toast) then divided by n? Actually, wait: the formula above was T <= (k*l) / (n*nl). But note: the drink requirement for T toasts per friend is T*n*nl. So the maximum T is floor((k*l) / (n*nl)).\n\n            However, note: if we do integer division, then (k*l) // (n*nl) is the same as floor((k*l)/(n*nl)) for positive integers.\n\n            Similarly for the others.\n\n        So code:\n\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n            # Calculate the maximum toasts per friend from each resource\n            drink_toasts = (k * l) // (n * nl)   # Because T * n * nl <= k*l -> T <= (k*l) / (n*nl); integer division gives the floor.\n            lime_toasts = (c * d) // n            # Because T * n <= c*d -> T <= (c*d) / n; integer division gives floor.\n            salt_toasts = p // (n * np)            # Because T * n * np <= p -> T <= p / (n*np); integer division gives floor.\n\n            # The answer is the minimum of these three\n            ans = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        But wait: why did we use n*nl in the denominator for drink_toasts? Because the drink requirement per toast for the entire friend's set is n*nl (for one toast for each of the n friends). However, note: we are calculating toasts per friend. The total drink used for T toasts per friend is T * n * nl. So the constraint is T <= (k*l) / (n*nl). \n\n        However, note: the example calculation in the problem statement for the drink was 20/3 (which is 6.66) and then they divided by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2. That is equivalent to:\n\n            T = (k*l) / (n * nl)   [without integer division] -> 20/(3*3)=20/9≈2.22, then floor to 2.\n\n        So our calculation is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if the division is not exact? We are using integer division which truncates. However, the condition is T * n * nl <= k*l. The maximum integer T satisfying that is indeed floor((k*l) / (n*nl)).\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n            drink_limit = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n            lime_limit = (c * d) // n\n            salt_limit = p // (n * np)\n            ans = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n\n        Print ans.\n\n        However, note: the constraints say the numbers are positive integers and at least 1, so no division by zero.\n\n        Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \n            Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n            drink_limit = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20 // 9 = 2\n            lime_limit = (10*8) // 3 = 80 // 3 = 26\n            salt_limit = 100 // (3*1) = 100 // 3 = 33\n            min(2,26,33)=2 -> Output 2.\n\n        Example 2: \n            Input: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\"\n            drink_limit = (100*10) // (5*4) = 1000 // 20 = 50\n            lime_limit = (1*19) // 5 = 19 //5 = 3\n            salt_limit = 90 // (5*3) = 90 //15 = 6\n            min(50,3,6)=3 -> Output 3.\n\n        Example 3: \n            Input: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\"\n            drink_limit = (1000*1000) // (10*50) = 1000000 // 500 = 2000\n            lime_limit = (25*23) // 10 = 575 //10 = 57\n            salt_limit = 1 // (10*1) = 1//10 = 0\n            min(2000,57,0)=0 -> Output 0.\n\n        It matches.\n\n        But wait: the example input is given as:\n\n            ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n        However, note: the second example input is \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\", and the third is \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\".\n\n        We are reading from stdin, so we just read one line.\n\n        Code:\n\n            data = input().split()\n            if not data:\n                # but the problem says there is one line with 8 integers, so we assume there is data.\n                pass\n            n = int(data[0]); k = int(data[1]); l = int(data[2]); c = int(data[3]); d = int(data[4]); p = int(data[5]); nl = int(data[6]); np = int(data[7])\n\n            drink_limit = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n            lime_limit = (c * d) // n\n            salt_limit = p // (n * np)\n\n            ans = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        However, note: the example inputs are provided as a list of strings, but in the problem, the input is one line.\n\n        We'll write accordingly.\n\n        But wait: what if the division is not exact? Our integer division is correct because we are only concerned with whole toasts.\n\n        Let me test with non-exact division:\n\n            Suppose: n=2, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\n            Then: \n                drink_limit = (1*1) // (2*1) = 1//2 = 0\n                lime_limit = (1*1) // 2 = 0\n                salt_limit = 1 // (2*1) = 0\n\n            Then answer 0.\n\n            Is that correct? \n                We have 1 ml of drink, but two friends. Each toast for one friend requires 1 ml. So for two friends to have at least one toast, we need 2 ml. We don't have that. So 0 is correct.\n\n        Another test: n=1, k=10, l=10, c=10, d=10, p=10, nl=1, np=1.\n\n            drink_limit = (10*10) // (1*1) = 100\n            lime_limit = (10*10) // 1 = 100\n            salt_limit = 10 // (1*1) = 10\n            ans = 10.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n            Read the 8 integers from stdin.\n\n            n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n            drink_limit = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n            lime_limit = (c * d) // n\n            salt_limit = p // (n * np)\n\n            print(min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit))\n\n        However, note: the problem says the numbers are separated by exactly one space, so split() is safe.\n\n        Let's run the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\" -> 2\n        Example 2: \"5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\" -> 3\n        Example 3: \"10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\" -> 0\n\n        Therefore, we output the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the limiting factor among the drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring that all friends can participate equally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on the available resources. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The solution involves determining how many toasts can be made considering all constraints (drink, lime, and salt) and then finding the minimum value across these constraints to ensure all friends can partake equally.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution hinges on three main calculations:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The total available drink divided by the drink required per toast per friend.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The total available lime slices divided by the number of friends (since each toast requires one slice per friend).\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The total available salt divided by the salt required per toast per friend.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each resource (drink, lime, salt), compute the maximum number of toasts per friend that can be supported. The answer is the minimum of these three values, as it represents the bottleneck resource that limits the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, making it efficient with a constant time complexity O(1), suitable for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    drink_limit = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n    lime_limit = (c * d) // n\n    salt_limit = p // (n * np)\n    \n    ans = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of eight integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters per toast, and grams of salt per toast, respectively.\n2. **Calculating Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Limit**: Total drink volume (k * l) divided by the drink required per toast for all friends (n * nl), using integer division to ensure whole numbers.\n   - **Lime Limit**: Total lime slices (c * d) divided by the number of friends (n), again using integer division.\n   - **Salt Limit**: Total salt (p) divided by the salt required per toast for all friends (n * np), using integer division.\n3. **Determining Result**: The result is the smallest of the three calculated values, ensuring no resource is exceeded while allowing all friends to make the same number of toasts.\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of toasts each friend can make under the given constraints.",
