On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, note: The array only contains 1s and 2s.\n\n Observation:\n Since the array is composed only of 1s and 2s, the non-decreasing subsequence can be at most the entire sequence if we have a sequence of 1s then 2s.\n However, we are allowed to reverse any contiguous interval [l, r]. \n\n Let's think:\n\n Without any reversal, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a sequence of 1s and 2s is simply the total number of elements if the entire sequence is non-decreasing? \n But note: we might have a mix. Actually, the LNDS in such an array is the length of the entire array if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we can break it down.\n\n However, note that after reversal, we can change the order of a contiguous segment. The reversal might help to fix some inversions.\n\n Since the array is only 1 and 2, the entire sequence must be non-decreasing if there is no 2 followed by a 1. So the goal is to have as many consecutive 1s and 2s as possible.\n\n What are the possibilities?\n There are two types of operations: reversing an interval. This operation can change a segment that originally has a pattern to a pattern that might be more favorable.\n\n Important: We are allowed to reverse any contiguous interval. Therefore, we can consider that we might want to \"fix\" a part of the array that has 2s followed by 1s.\n\n However, note: the reversal operation is not limited to fixing one inversion. It reverses a contiguous segment, so it might fix multiple inversions but also create new ones.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider that the final sequence must be a permutation of the original. The LNDS in a sequence of 1s and 2s is determined by the entire array being split into a block of 1s and then a block of 2s. The maximum length of the LNDS would be the entire array if the entire array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, we might get a longer subsequence by having a larger contiguous block of 1s and 2s.\n\n But note: we are allowed to reverse one contiguous segment. How does that affect?\n\n Let's denote:\n   Original sequence: A = [a1, a2, ..., an]\n\n After reversing [l, r]: \n   The new sequence is: [a1, ..., al-1, ar, ar-1, ..., al, ar+1, ... an]\n\n Since the reversal operation can only reverse one contiguous segment, we have to consider how to maximize the longest non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n Note: The entire sequence is made of 1s and 2s. The longest non-decreasing subsequence in such an array is the entire sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing. Otherwise, the LNDS is the total length (because we can always pick all the 1s and then all the 2s, but wait: what if the reversal breaks the possibility of having a contiguous block of 1s and 2s? Actually, the entire sequence is still the same multiset of 1s and 2s. So the LNDS cannot exceed the total number of elements. And note: the entire sequence is not necessarily non-decreasing, but we can choose a non-decreasing subsequence that picks every element because the sequence only has two numbers. However, wait: that is true only if the sequence is non-decreasing. But if we have a 2 and then a 1, then we cannot have both in an increasing subsequence.\n\n Actually, the entire sequence is fixed (same multiset) so the entire sequence is not necessarily non-decreasing, but we can form a non-decreasing subsequence by taking all the 1s and then all the 2s. The length of that subsequence is (total number of 1s + total number of 2s) = n. However, wait: that is the entire sequence. But if the sequence is not non-decreasing, we cannot take the entire sequence as a non-decreasing subsequence. However, note: the entire sequence is not required to be contiguous. But wait, the definition of non-decreasing subsequence allows non-contiguous indices. \n\n Actually, the problem is about the entire sequence. But note: the entire sequence might have inversions (2 then 1). Then the entire sequence is not non-decreasing. However, we can take the entire sequence as a non-decreasing subsequence only if we can reorder the indices arbitrarily? No, the indices must be increasing. But note: the condition is that the values at increasing indices must be non-decreasing. So if we have a 2 followed by a 1, then we cannot include both in the same non-decreasing subsequence.\n\n However, note: the entire sequence is fixed. We can choose a subsequence (not necessarily",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in a binary sequence (composed of 1s and 2s) after reversing any contiguous interval within the sequence. The key observation here is that the LNDS in such a sequence is determined by the arrangement of 1s and 2s, where all 1s must come before all 2s for the entire sequence to be non-decreasing. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Analysis**: The problem involves a sequence of 1s and 2s. The goal is to reverse a contiguous interval to maximize the length of the LNDS. The LNDS can be the entire sequence if it is non-decreasing (all 1s followed by all 2s). Otherwise, the LNDS will be the sum of the number of 1s and 2s, but constrained by the arrangement after reversal.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal solution involves ensuring that after reversal, as many 1s as possible appear before any 2s. The reversal operation can help in moving 1s from positions after 2s to earlier positions, thus increasing the LNDS length.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Step 1**: Count the total number of 1s and 2s in the sequence.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the leftmost 2 and the rightmost 1. These positions are critical because reversing around them can potentially bring more 1s to the left of 2s.\n   - **Step 3**: Calculate the potential LNDS by considering the number of 1s to the left of the leftmost 2 and the number of 2s to the right of the rightmost 1. The sum of these counts gives the maximum possible LNDS after an optimal reversal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    total_ones = sum(1 for num in arr if num == 1)\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n\n    leftmost_two = None\n    rightmost_one = None\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if arr[i] == 2:\n            leftmost_two = i\n            break\n\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        if arr[i] == 1:\n            rightmost_one = i\n            break\n\n    if leftmost_two is None or rightmost_one is None:\n        print(n)\n        return\n\n    ones_left = 0\n    for i in range(leftmost_two):\n        if arr[i] == 1:\n            ones_left += 1\n\n    twos_right = 0\n    for i in range(rightmost_one+1, n):\n        if arr[i] == 2:\n            twos_right += 1\n\n    candidate1 = ones_left + total_twos\n    candidate2 = total_ones + twos_right\n\n    ans = max(candidate1, candidate2)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the sequence length and the sequence itself.\n2. **Counting 1s and 2s**: It calculates the total number of 1s and 2s in the sequence.\n3. **Finding Critical Positions**: It identifies the leftmost occurrence of 2 and the rightmost occurrence of 1. These positions are crucial because reversing around them can maximize the number of 1s before 2s.\n4. **Calculating Potential LNDS**: \n   - **ones_left**: Counts the number of 1s to the left of the leftmost 2.\n   - **twos_right**: Counts the number of 2s to the right of the rightmost 1.\n5. **Determining Maximum LNDS**: The maximum LNDS is either the sum of 1s to the left of the leftmost 2 and all 2s, or the sum of all 1s and 2s to the right of the rightmost 1. The larger of these two values is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to critical segments of the sequence, leveraging the binary nature of the elements to compute the optimal solution with minimal computational overhead.",
