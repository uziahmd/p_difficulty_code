She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Python script is ready to solve this competitive programming problem!**  I've broken down the problem into a few key cases based on the position of the desired tab range `[l, r]` relative to the total number of tabs `n`.\n\n*   **Case 1:** If the desired range *is* the entire range (l=1, r=n), then there's nothing to do, and the cost is 0.\n\n*   **Case 2:** If only the tabs to the *left* of `l` need closing (l>1, r=n), I'll move the cursor to `l` and close them, so `abs(pos - l) + 1` seconds.\n\n*   **Case 3:** If only the tabs to the *right* of `r` need closing (l=1, r<n), I'll move the cursor to `r` and close them, so `abs(pos - r) + 1` seconds.\n\n*   **Case 4:** If tabs on *both* sides of `[l, r]` need closing (l>1, r<n), it's the most interesting. The key is to get the cursor to `l` and `r` efficiently. I've figured out the best strategy is to calculate the time to get to `l` and `r` and *select* the minimum path: the cursor will either move from starting position to `l` then `r` or starting position to `r` then `l`. The time cost is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`  since we must close `2` groups of tabs.\n\nI've tested the cases with examples (including edge cases), and my formula produces the correct results, so I am confident I've got this one! I'm now ready to write the code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all browser tabs outside a specified range `[l, r]`. We are given the total number of tabs `n`, the initial cursor position `pos`, and the target range `[l, r]`.\n\nThere are four types of operations, each taking 1 second:\n1.  Move cursor left: `pos -> max(pos-1, a)`\n2.  Move cursor right: `pos -> min(pos+1, b)`\n3.  Close tabs to the left of cursor: `[a, pos-1]`\n4.  Close tabs to the right of cursor: `[pos+1, b]`\n\nHere, `a` and `b` represent the minimum and maximum indices of currently unclosed tabs. Initially, `a=1` and `b=n`.\n\nWe need to close tabs in the segments `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`).\n\nLet's analyze the problem based on which segments need to be closed:\n\n**1. No tabs need to be closed:**\nThis occurs if the target range `[l, r]` covers all tabs, i.e., `l = 1` and `r = n`.\nIn this case, no operations are needed.\n**Cost: 0**\n\n**2. Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed:**\nThis occurs if `l = 1` and `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.\nTo do this, the cursor must be at or to the left of `r`. The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `r` and then perform the \"close tabs to the right\" operation.\n*   Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n*   Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: 1 second.\n**Total Cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1`**\n\n**3. Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed:**\nThis occurs if `l > 1` and `r = n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`.\nTo do this, the cursor must be at or to the right of `l`. The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `l` and then perform the \"close tabs to the left\" operation.\n*   Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n*   Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: 1 second.\n**Total Cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1`**\n\n**4. Tabs to both the left of `l` AND the right of `r` need to be closed:**\nThis occurs if `l > 1` and `r < n`. We need to close `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.\nThis requires two \"close\" operations, each costing 1 second, for a total of 2 seconds for closing. The remaining time will be for cursor movement.\nTo close `[1, l-1]`, the cursor must be at `l` (or to its right).\nTo close `[r+1, n]`, the cursor must be at `r` (or to its left).\nEffectively, the cursor needs to visit both `l` and `r`. There are two main sequences of operations:\n\n*   **Sequence A: Close left part first, then right part.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)`.\n    2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n    3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `r - l`. (Since `l <= r`).\n    4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n    Total cost for Sequence A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n\n*   **Sequence B: Close right part first, then left part.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)`.\n    2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n    3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `r - l`. (Since `l <= r`).\n    4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n    Total cost for Sequence B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`\n\nWe need the minimum of these two strategies.\n`min( (abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2), (abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2) )`\nThis simplifies to: `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`\n**Total Cost: `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`**\n\nThe `a` and `b` bounds on movement and closing operations do not complicate this logic, as `l` and `r` are always within the current active tab range (or become the new `a`/`b`), allowing all necessary movements and closings.\n\nLet's implement this logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    cost = 0\n\n    # Case 1: All tabs are already within [l, r]. No action needed.\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        cost = 0\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the right of r need to be closed (l is already 1).\n    elif l == 1:\n        # Move cursor to r, then close tabs to the right.\n        # Movement cost: abs(pos - r)\n        # Closing cost: 1\n        cost = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the left of l need to be closed (r is already n).\n    elif r == n:\n        # Move cursor to l, then close tabs to the left.\n        # Movement cost: abs(pos - l)\n        # Closing cost: 1\n        cost = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    # Case 4: Tabs to both left of l AND right of r need to be closed.\n    else:\n        # We need to perform two closing operations (cost 2 seconds).\n        # The cursor must visit both l (to close left) and r (to close right).\n        # The total movement cost will be:\n        # (distance from initial pos to the first boundary visited) +\n        # (distance between l and r)\n        # The distance between l and r is always (r - l).\n        # We choose to go to either l or r first, whichever is closer to pos.\n        # Movement cost: min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l)\n        # Total cost = Movement cost + Closing cost\n        cost = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n    \n    print(cost)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
