The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing Rock-Paper-Scissors Losses with Cyclic Strategies**\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many losses Nikephoros and Polycarpus rack up in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, given that they both use repeating strategies.  The key is that the number of rounds, `n`, can be massive (up to 2 billion!), while the lengths of their sequences, `m` and `k`, are comparatively small (at most 1000 each).  This screams \"find the repeating pattern!\"\n\nMy first instinct is to define the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. Draws don't count as losses.  A loss is a red spot, as the prompt specifies.\n\nSince Nikephoros and Polycarpus use cyclic sequences `A` and `B`, I need to realize that the *least common multiple* (LCM) of `m` and `k` will determine the length of the repeating cycle of their moves.  This makes sense – it's the smallest number of rounds where their sequences will realign.  I can efficiently calculate this LCM, which is simply `(m * k) / GCD(m, k)`.  And since both m and k are bounded, this LCM will be small enough to easily compute.\n\nThe core idea is to figure out the losses within one complete cycle of length `L = LCM(m, k)`.  I can iterate through this cycle, simulating each round with Nikephoros playing `A[i % m]` and Polycarpus playing `B[i % k]`, and keep track of who wins.  This gives me `n_losses_N_cycle` and `n_losses_P_cycle`.\n\nNow comes the clever part: to handle the large number of total rounds `n`. I can calculate how many full cycles fit into `n` by using integer division: `num_full_cycles = n // L`.  The remaining rounds after the full cycles are handled with the modulo operator: `remaining_rounds = n % L`.\n\nThe total losses are therefore: `total_losses_N = num_full_cycles * n_losses_N_cycle + losses_N_remaining` and `total_losses_P = num_full_cycles * n_losses_P_cycle + losses_P_remaining`.  The `losses_remaining` can be calculated by running through the initial `remaining_rounds`.  This should give me the correct result without needing to simulate every single round. It's a neat optimization. I think this will work.\n",
