The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Diving Deep into \"The Number Games\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Number Games\" problem in front of me, and my initial thought is, \"Python solution, let's go!\"  First things first, I need to break down the structure. It's clear that the districts and roads form a tree. That's a key piece of information.  We've got these contestants with fans exponentially increasing with their district number, which is a classic setup. The goal is to maximize the total fans of the *remaining* contestants after removing `k` of them.\n\nThe connected component constraint is really what makes this interesting. We can't just pick the `n-k` best districts, because removing a district makes it impassable. That means the remaining districts have to form a connected subgraph. It feels a bit like a game of strategic removals.\n\nThe real insight here is the weight of each district, it's growing at an exponential rate. That screams, \"prioritize the bigger numbers!\" So, when we need to remove districts, we should be aiming for the *smallest* indices possible. That's the core of the greedy approach I'm thinking about.\n\nHowever, the connectivity requirement is the kicker. How do we ensure we keep a connected component while being greedy?  It's clear that we'll need to remove nodes with smaller indices, but removing a node could force us to remove more. That's where things get tricky.\n\nI'm thinking about it from the \"keeping\" perspective.  We need to keep `n-k` districts that have the largest indices and also maintain connectivity.  Sorting the indices in descending order is the right way to visualize this. Starting from `n`, we try to choose the nodes which maintains a connected component, meaning that either the nodes are adjacent or connected via other chosen nodes. This is where I start thinking about tree DP or some specialized graph algorithm.\n\nSo, in essence, the problem boils down to selecting a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that maximizes the sum of the node values, where the values are `2` raised to the power of the node's index. That's my rephrased version of the challenge.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts such that they form a connected subgraph in the original tree, and the sum of `2^i` for these districts is maximized. This is equivalent to minimizing the sum of `2^i` for the `k` removed districts. Since `2^i` grows very rapidly with `i`, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices and removing districts with smaller indices.\n\nLet's rephrase the problem: we need to find a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that contains districts with the largest possible indices.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order of their indices: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`. We want to select `n-k` districts from this list, starting from `n`, such that they form a connected component.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1.  We *must* keep the district with the largest index, `n`, because `2^n` is by far the largest contribution.\n2.  We then greedily try to keep districts with the next largest indices, `n-1, n-2, ...`, as long as we can maintain connectivity and stay within our `n-k` target.\n\nThis leads to a specific algorithm:\nStart by marking district `n` as \"kept\". We need to keep `n-k` districts in total.\nIterate downwards from district `n-1` to `1`. For each district `i`:\nIf district `i` is currently connected to the set of \"kept\" districts (i.e., it has at least one neighbor that is already \"kept\"), then we can potentially keep district `i`. If we keep it, we add `i` to our \"kept\" set.\nIf district `i` is *not* connected to the set of \"kept\" districts, then keeping it would mean creating a new disconnected component, or requiring us to keep additional districts just to connect it to the main component. This is generally suboptimal as it would force us to keep smaller-indexed districts later, or exceed our `n-k` limit.\n\nHowever, this greedy approach doesn't quite work directly. What if `i` is not connected to the current \"kept\" set, but it's the *only* way to connect a very large-indexed node `j` (which is not yet processed) to the \"kept\" set?\n\nA better approach is to consider which nodes to *remove*. We want to remove `k` nodes with the smallest possible indices.\nThe `n-k` nodes we keep must form a connected component. If we fix a root for this component (say, the node with the largest index among the `n-k` nodes), then all other `n-k-1` nodes must be reachable from it *without passing through any removed nodes*.\n\nThis structure suggests that the `n-k` nodes we keep will form a connected subtree if we consider the tree rooted arbitrarily (e.g., at node `n`).\nThe \"largest indices first\" strategy is crucial. We will always try to keep the node `n`.\nThen we try to keep `n-1`, `n-2`, ..., as many as possible, up to `n-k` nodes.\n\nLet's maintain a set of `n-k` nodes. We want to maximize their sum.\nConsider the nodes from `n` down to `1`.\nWe *must* keep node `n`. Add `n` to our set of `n-k` nodes.\nNow, we have `n-k-1` spots left.\nFor `i = n-1` down to `1`:\nIf `i` is connected to any node already in our set of `n-k` nodes, we can add `i` to our set. But we have a limit of `n-k` nodes.\n\nThis problem can be solved by a greedy strategy based on a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the largest indexed node (`n`).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Build Adjacency List:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list.\n2.  **Initialize:**\n    *   `kept_nodes`: A set to store the indices of districts we decide to keep. Initially, add district `n` to this set.\n    *   `removed_nodes`: A list to store the indices of districts we decide to remove.\n    *   `q`: A queue for BFS/DFS, initialized with district `n`.\n    *   `visited`: A boolean array/set to track visited nodes during traversal, initialized with `n` as visited.\n    *   `count_kept`: Number of districts currently kept, initialized to `1` (for district `n`).\n3.  **Iterate for Removal:** We need to remove `k` nodes. We will iterate downwards from `n-1` to `1`. The goal is to remove nodes with small indices, *unless* removing them disconnects a path to a larger-indexed node that we want to keep.\n    This is tricky. A simpler approach is to determine the `n-k` nodes to keep.\n\nLet's use a modified BFS/DFS to find the `n-k` nodes to keep:\n\nThe optimal set of `n-k` nodes will always include node `n` because `2^n` is the largest possible value.\nWe can use a BFS-like approach, but prioritizing larger indices.\n\n1.  **Adjacency List:** Build `adj` list for the tree.\n2.  **`is_removed` array:** Create a boolean array `is_removed` of size `n+1`, initialized to `False`. This tracks which nodes are kept.\n3.  **`removed_count`:** Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n4.  **Iterate from `n` down to `1`:**\n    *   For `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n        *   If `is_removed[i]` is already `True` (meaning `i` was marked for removal because it was a leaf of a subtree being removed), continue.\n        *   If `n - removed_count == k` (meaning we have exactly `k` nodes marked for removal, so all remaining nodes must be kept), then we are done. Break the loop.\n        *   Otherwise, we *tentatively* mark `i` for removal: `is_removed[i] = True`, `removed_count += 1`.\n        *   **Check Connectivity:** Now, we need to verify if the remaining `n - removed_count` nodes form a connected component. This is the core challenge.\n            A simpler check: If `i` is a leaf node in the *current* graph (considering only nodes not yet marked `is_removed`), and `i` is not node `n`, then we can remove `i` without disconnecting anything *if* its parent is still connected to the main component.\n            This is essentially removing leaves.\n\nThe problem can be solved by iteratively removing \"leaf\" nodes that have the smallest indices.\nA node `u` is a \"leaf\" if it has degree 1 in the *current* graph formed by the remaining nodes. If `u` is not node `n`, and it has the smallest index among all current leaves, we can remove it.\n\n**Corrected Greedy Approach (Iterative Leaf Removal):**\n\n1.  **Build Adjacency List:** `adj` where `adj[u]` stores neighbors of `u`.\n2.  **`degree` array:** `degree[u]` stores the current degree of node `u`. Initialize with actual degrees.\n3.  **`removed_nodes` set:** Initialize an empty set to store removed nodes.\n4.  **`q` (priority queue):** A min-priority queue storing tuples `(node_index, node_index)` for all nodes `u` such that `degree[u] == 1` and `u != n`.\n    *   We use `(node_index, node_index)` because Python's `heapq` is a min-heap, and we want to retrieve the smallest `node_index`.\n    *   Add all initial leaf nodes (degree 1) except `n` to `q`. If `n` is a leaf, it cannot be removed unless `n-k=1` and `n` is the only node.\n5.  **Iterate `k` times:**\n    *   While `len(removed_nodes) < k`:\n        *   If `q` is empty, it means we cannot remove any more leaves without potentially disconnecting the graph (or `n` is the only remaining node). This shouldn't happen if `k < n`.\n        *   Extract the node `u` with the smallest index from `q`.\n        *   Add `u` to `removed_nodes`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n            *   Decrement `degree[v]`.\n            *   If `degree[v]` becomes `1` and `v` is not `n` and `v` is not already in `removed_nodes`, add `v` to `q`. (Important: `v` might already be in `q` with a higher degree, but it will be processed later. Or it might be added again. Using a set for `removed_nodes` handles duplicates if `v` is already processed.)\n            *   A more robust way for `q`: only add `v` to `q` if it's not `n` and `v` is not yet removed. When extracting from `q`, check if `u` is already removed. If so, skip.\n\nThis greedy approach works because removing a leaf node `u` (that is not node `n`) with the smallest index among all current leaves guarantees that we are removing the smallest possible `2^u` value without disconnecting any other part of the graph. The remaining graph `G'` is still connected, and its leaves are candidates for the next removal.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n=6, k=3`\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\n\n1.  **Adjacency List:**\n    `1: [2]`\n    `2: [1, 6, 4, 3]`\n    `3: [2]`\n    `4: [2]`\n    `5: [6]`\n    `6: [2, 5]`\n\n2.  **Degrees:**\n    `deg[1]=1`, `deg[2]=4`, `deg[3]=1`, `deg[4]=1`, `deg[5]=1`, `deg[6]=2`\n\n3.  **Initialize `removed_nodes` = set(), `q` (min-heap):**\n    `n=6`.\n    Leaves are 1, 3, 4, 5. All are not `n`.\n    `q = [(1,1), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)]`\n\n4.  **Remove `k=3` nodes:**\n\n    *   **Iteration 1:**\n        *   Pop `(1,1)` from `q`. `u=1`.\n        *   Add `1` to `removed_nodes`. `removed_nodes = {1}`.\n        *   Neighbor of `1` is `2`. `deg[2]` becomes `3`.\n        *   `deg[2]` is not `1`, so `2` is not added to `q`.\n        *   `len(removed_nodes)` is `1`. Need to remove `2` more.\n\n    *   **Iteration 2:**\n        *   Pop `(3,3)` from `q`. `u=3`.\n        *   Add `3` to `removed_nodes`. `removed_nodes = {1, 3}`.\n        *   Neighbor of `3` is `2`. `deg[2]` becomes `2`.\n        *   `deg[2]` is not `1`.\n        *   `len(removed_nodes)` is `2`. Need to remove `1` more.\n\n    *   **Iteration 3:**\n        *   Pop `(4,4)` from `q`. `u=4`.\n        *   Add `4` to `removed_nodes`. `removed_nodes = {1, 3, 4}`.\n        *   Neighbor of `4` is `2`. `deg[2]` becomes `1`.\n        *   `deg[2]` is `1`, `2` is not `n` (which is `6`), `2` is not in `removed_nodes`. Add `(2,2)` to `q`. `q = [(2,2), (5,5)]`.\n        *   `len(removed_nodes)` is `3`. Done.\n\n5.  **Output:** Sort `removed_nodes`: `[1, 3, 4]`.\n\nThis matches the sample output.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   `k=n-1`: We remove `n-1` nodes, leaving only `1` node. This node must be `n`. The algorithm will remove all leaves until only `n` remains, which is correct.\n*   `n` itself is a leaf (e.g., `1-2-3-4-5-6`). `n=6` is degree 1. It will not be added to `q`. Its neighbor (e.g., 5) will have its degree reduced and eventually become a leaf itself, and be added to `q`. This works.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list: `O(N+M)` where `M=N-1` for a tree. So `O(N)`.\n*   Initializing degrees and priority queue: `O(N)`.\n*   Loop `k` times:\n    *   `heapq.heappop`: `O(log N)`\n    *   Iterating neighbors: `deg[u]` neighbors. Total degree updates over all iterations is `O(N)` because each edge is processed at most twice (when its endpoints are removed).\n    *   `heapq.heappush`: `O(log N)`\n    *   In total, `k` pops and at most `2*(N-1)` pushes. Total `O(N log N)`.\n*   Sorting `removed_nodes`: `O(k log k)`.\n\nOverall complexity: `O(N log N)`. Given `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is acceptable (`10^6 * log_2 10^6` approx `10^6 * 20`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    degrees = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        degrees[u] += 1\n        degrees[v] += 1\n\n    # Priority queue for leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1)\n    # We store (node_index, node_index) because heapq is a min-heap\n    # and we want to extract nodes with the smallest index first.\n    pq = [] \n\n    # Keep track of nodes that have been marked for removal\n    is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # The node 'n' (largest index) is special.

Loop:\n    #    a. **Process forced removals first:** While `forced_q` is not empty AND `removed_count < k`:\n    #       Pop `(u, u)` from `forced_q`.\n    #       If `is_removed[u]` is true, continue.\n    #       Mark `is_removed[u] = True`, add `u` to `removed_list`, `removed_count += 1`.\n    #       Update neighbors of `u` (decrement degrees).

This is impossible in a tree, as there are always leaves\n    #       unless only one node remains. The only scenario is if `n` is the only remaining node\n    #       and `removed_count < k` implies `k = n-1`.\n    #       The problem guarantees `k < n`. So this implies we must remove a non-leaf node.\n    #       This would be the smallest-indexed non-removed, non-n node. This is a different strategy.\n    #       However, for a tree, this should not happen.\n\n    # Let's stick with the simpler leaf removal, and trust that if a node becomes degree 0,\n    # it *was* a leaf before its last neighbor was removed, and thus would have been processed.\n    # The only exception is if `n` is the only node left, and `k = n-1`.\n    # In that case, `n` is kept, and the `removed_count` will be `n-1`.\n\n    # Final simplified logic for the loop:\n    # 1. Pop from PQ. If `u` is already removed or not a leaf (degrees[u] != 1), skip.\n    # 2. Mark `u` removed. Add to `removed_list`. Increment `removed_count`.\n    # 3. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n    #    Decrement `degrees[v]`.\n    #    If `degrees[v] == 1` and `v != n` and `v` is not yet removed, add `(v,v)` to `pq`.\n    #    Crucially, if `degrees[v] == 0` and `v != n`, then `v` is now isolated. It *must* be removed.\n    #    This means we should add `v` to `removed_list` and `is_removed[v]=True`, and `removed_count++`.\n    #    This is a recursive removal. This is problematic if `v` has a larger index than other `pq` nodes.\n    #    The strategy must be strictly smallest index first, or forced removal.\n\n    # The problem implies we must remove `k` nodes.
