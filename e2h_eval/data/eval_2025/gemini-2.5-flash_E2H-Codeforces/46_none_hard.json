The value (j - i + 1) denotes the length of the subsegment.Your task is to find the longest subsegment of a, such that it is possible to change at most one number (change one number to any integer you want) from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing.You only need to output the length of the subsegment you find.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).\n\n## Output\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6']\n\n### Output\n['5']\n\n## Note\nYou can choose subsegment a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and change its 3rd element (that is a4) to 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

The subsegment is already strictly increasing (no change needed). Max length is `max(left)`.\n    #    This covers cases where we don't use our \"one change\" ability.\n    #    For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `max_len = 5`.\n    #    `[1, 2, 5, 4, 3]`, `max_len = 2` (from `[1, 2]`).\n    #\n    # 2. We change an element `a[i]` to `X`.\n    #    a. `a[i]` becomes part of a longer subsegment by extending a subsegment to its left.\n    #       For any `j < n-1`, if we change `a[j+1]` to `a[j]+1`, the length of the subsegment ending at `j+1` becomes `left[j] + 1`.\n    #       This is equivalent to considering `left[j]` and extending it by 1 to the right.\n    #       So, `max_len = max(max_len, left[j] + 1)` for `j < n-1`.\n    #       Similarly, for any `j > 0`, if we change `a[j-1]` to `a[j]-1`, the length of the subsegment starting at `j-1` becomes `right[j] + 1`.\n    #       So, `max_len = max(max_len, right[j] + 1)` for `j > 0`.\n    #       These two cases can be summarized as: for any `k` from `0` to `n-1`, we can potentially make `left[k] + 1` or `right[k] + 1` length.\n    #       This implies `max_len = max(max_len, left[k] + 1)` for all `k` where `k < n-1`.\n    #       And `max_len = max(max_len, right[k] + 1)` for all `k` where `k > 0`.\n    #       This is effectively `min(n, max(left) + 1)` if `n > 1`.\n    #       Let's initialize `max_len = 1` if `n >= 1`, else `0`.\n    #       If `n == 0`, `max_len = 0`.

(This is a safe lower bound for `n >= 2`)\n    # Let's use `max_len = 0` and update it.\n    # For `n=0`, `max_len=0`.\n    # For `n=1`, `max_len=1`.\n    # For `n >= 1`, `max_len` should be at least `max(left)` (no change).\n    # And for `n >= 2`, `max_len` should be at least `max(left) + 1` (change one adjacent element).\n    # Example: `[7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]`. `left = [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`. `max(left) = 3`.\n    # If we extend `[5, 6]` (length 2) by changing `a[3]` (1) to `4`, we get `[4, 5, 6]`. Length 3.\n    # If we extend `[2, 3]` (length 2) by changing `a[0]` (7) to `1`, we get `[1, 2, 3]`. Length 3.\n    # This `max(left) + 1` logic is for extending an existing subsegment.\n    #\n    # The actual calculation for `max_len` should be:\n    # 1. Initialize `max_len = 0`.\n    # 2. If `n > 0`, `max_len = 1`.\n    # 3. For `i` from `0` to `n-1`: `max_len = max(max_len, left[i])`. (No change needed)\n    # 4. For `i` from `0` to `n-1`:\n    #    If `i > 0`: `max_len = max(max_len, left[i-1] + 1)`. (Change `a[i]` to extend `left[i-1]`)\n    #    If `i < n-1`: `max_len = max(max_len, right[i+1] + 1)`. (Change `a[i]` to extend `right[i+1]`)\n    #    These two cases are essentially saying: take any strictly increasing subsegment `S`, and extend it by one element\n    #    either to its left or to its right by changing one element. The length would be `len(S) + 1`.\n    #    This is equivalent to `min(n, max(left) + 1)` for `n > 0`.\n    #    Let's combine: `max_len = max(max(left), min(n, max(left) + 1))` if `n > 0`.\n    #    This still doesn't get 5 for the example.\n\n    # Let's consider the three types of subsegments after at most one change:\n    # Type 1: The subsegment is already strictly increasing.\n    #   The maximum length for this type is `max(left)` (or `max(right)`).\n    #   We can initialize `max_len` with this value.\n    #   If `n=0`, `max_len=0`. If `n=1`, `max_len=1`.\n    #   If `n >= 1`, `max_len = max(left)` (which is `max(right)`).\n    #   For `[7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]`, `left = [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`. `max_len = 3`.\n\n    # Type 2: We change an element `a[i]` to `X`, and this `X` becomes the new end of a subsegment\n    #   that was strictly increasing to its left, or the new beginning of a subsegment\n    #   that was strictly increasing to its right.\n    #   Effectively, we take `left[i-1]` and make `a[i]` `a[i-1]+1`.
