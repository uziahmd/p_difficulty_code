For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my understanding of the problem and the solution approach:**\n\nI'm tackling a competitive programming challenge. The core task is to count how many ways we can assign values (0 to k) to binary strings ('c_s' values) such that the maximum size of a \"beautiful multiset\" equals a given target 'f'. The multiset's \"beauty\" stems from an upper bound on how often each string's prefix appears.\n\nThe problem screams \"dynamic programming\" and hints at a binary tree (or trie) structure. I visualize the binary strings as nodes in a complete binary tree, with depth representing string length. `c_s` acts as a limit on the number of strings having `s` as a prefix (or the number of times `s` itself appears).\n\nTo maximize multiset size, I need to maximize string counts while staying within the `c_s` bounds. This translates to calculating `max_size(s)`, which represents the maximum number of strings having 's' as a prefix. For leaves, `max_size(s)` is simply `c_s`. For internal nodes, it's the `min` of `c_s` and the combined `max_size` of its children.  The ultimate multiset size is tied to  `N(\"\")` (the root of the tree, which is technically  `N(0) + N(1)` due to the \"length from 1 to n\" constraint).\n\nThe key insight is the symmetry across strings of the same length – their calculations are structurally identical. This allows me to define a DP state: `dp[d][val]` to represent the number of ways to assign `c_s` values for descendants of a node at depth `d-1` such that `max_size` for that node is `val`.\n\nThe base case for my DP is at the leaves (depth `n`): `dp[n][val] = 1` if `c_s = val` (which is `0 <= val <= k`), and 0 otherwise.\n\nFor depths less than `n`, I work bottom-up. The recurrence relation involves calculating a convolution, as the ways to form a certain `max_size` value depend on summing up combinations of `max_size` from children. I use Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) to efficiently handle this convolution.\n\nTo prevent numbers getting too large, I’m working modulo 998244353. The maximum size of intermediate values can be limited by the values of `f` and `k`.\n\nThe final answer is extracted by computing the convolution result, specifically looking at the `f`-th coefficient of the resulting polynomial. I need to keep in mind that I only need the `dp` values up to a maximum size of `f`, and any value greater than `f` will not be achievable. I'm using an NTT routine to multiply the polynomials, working within the necessary bounds.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to assign integer values `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) to every binary string `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of strings of length `n` is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo 998244353.\n\nLet `V(s)` be the maximum possible number of strings in a beautiful multiset that have `s` as a prefix.\nThe conditions for a beautiful multiset are: for every string `s` of length `1` to `n`, the number of strings in the multiset having `s` as a prefix must not exceed `c_s`.\nTo maximize the multiset size, we should make `V(s)` as large as possible.\n\n1.  **Base Case (Leaf Nodes):** If `s` is a string of length `n`, then `s` itself is an element of the multiset. The number of times `s` appears in the multiset is `V(s)`. The condition is `V(s) <= c_s`. To maximize, we set `V(s) = c_s`.\n\n2.  **Recursive Step (Internal Nodes):** If `s` is a string of length `d < n`, then `s0` and `s1` are its children. The strings in the multiset that have `s` as a prefix are exactly those that have `s0` as a prefix plus those that have `s1` as a prefix. So, `V(s) = V(s0) + V(s1)`. However, this sum must not exceed `c_s`. Therefore, `V(s) = min(c_s, V(s0) + V(s1))`.\n\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `V(\"0\") + V(\"1\")`. We want this sum to be exactly `f`.\n\nThis problem has a dynamic programming structure due to the symmetry of binary strings. All strings of the same length `d` behave identically in terms of how `V(s)` is calculated from its children and `c_s`.\nLet `dp[d][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s'` values for all strings `s'` that are descendants of a *single* node `s_parent` at depth `d-1` (meaning `s_parent` has length `d-1`), such that `V(s_parent)` (the maximum size for that node) is `val`. The `dp` computation will proceed from `d=n` down to `d=1`.\n\n**State Definition:**\n`dp_arr[d]` is a list (representing polynomial coefficients) where `dp_arr[d][val]` stores the number of ways to assign `c_s'` values for all strings `s'` that are descendants of a string `s` of length `d` (including `s` itself if `d=n`), such that `V(s)` equals `val`. We only need to compute `val` up to `f`. So `dp_arr[d]` will be an array of size `f+1`.\n\n**Base Case: `d = n`**\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `V(s) = c_s`. We need to choose `c_s` such that `V(s) = val`. This means `c_s` must be `val`. Since `0 <= c_s <= k`, this is possible if and only if `0 <= val <= k`.\nSo, `dp_arr[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k` (and `val <= f`), and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step: `d` from `n` down to `1`**\nWe want to compute `dp_arr[d-1]` using `dp_arr[d]`.\nLet `s_parent` be a string of length `d-1`. Its children are `s_parent + '0'` and `s_parent + '1'`.\nLet `P_d(x)` be the polynomial `sum_{val=0}^{f} dp_arr[d][val] * x^{val}`.\nThe number of ways to get `V(s_parent + '0') = val_0` and `V(s_parent + '1') = val_1` is `dp_arr[d][val_0] * dp_arr[d][val_1]`.\nThe sum of children's values is `S = val_0 + val_1`.\nThe number of ways to get a specific sum `S` from the children is the `S`-th coefficient of `P_d(x)^2`. Let `W[S]` be this coefficient.\n`W[S] = sum_{val_0 + val_1 = S} (dp_arr[d][val_0] * dp_arr[d][val_1])`.\nThis convolution can be computed efficiently using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). The maximum `S` can be `2f`.\n\nNow we calculate `dp_arr[d-1][val]` for `s_parent` of length `d-1`, where `V(s_parent) = val`.\nRecall `V(s_parent) = min(c_{s_parent}, S)`.\nWe need to choose `c_{s_parent}` from `0` to `k`.\nFor a fixed `S = val_0 + val_1`:\n*   If `val < S`: We must choose `c_{s_parent} = val`. This is only possible if `val <= k`. If so, there is 1 way to choose `c_{s_parent}`.\n*   If `val = S`: We must choose `c_{s_parent} >= S`. This is only possible if `S <= k`. If so, there are `k - S + 1` ways to choose `c_{s_parent}`.\n*   If `val > S`: Not possible, because `V(s_parent)` cannot exceed `S`.\n*   If `val > k`: Not possible, because `V(s_parent)` cannot exceed `c_{s_parent}` which is at most `k`.\n\nCombining these, `dp_arr[d-1][val]` for `val <= f` is:\nIf `val > k`, `dp_arr[d-1][val] = 0`.\nElse (`val <= k`):\n`dp_arr[d-1][val] = (W[val] * (k - val + 1) + sum_{S=val+1}^{2f} W[S]) % MOD`.\nLet `SuffixSum[S] = sum_{j=S}^{2f} W[j]`. This can be precomputed from `W`.\nThen, `dp_arr[d-1][val] = (W[val] * (k - val + 1) + SuffixSum[val+1]) % MOD`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nAfter computing `dp_arr[1]`, we need to find the number of ways to choose `c_s` for the entire tree such that `V(\"0\") + V(\"1\") = f`.\nThis is `sum_{val_0 + val_1 = f} (dp_arr[1][val_0] * dp_arr[1][val_1])`.\nThis is exactly the `f`-th coefficient of `P_1(x)^2`, where `P_1(x) = sum_{val=0}^{f} dp_arr[1][val] * x^{val}`.\nSo, we compute `Q = P_1(x)^2` using NTT, and the answer is `Q[f]`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Initialize `dp_arr[n]` (current `dp` array) as a list of size `f+1`.\n    `dp_arr[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= min(f, k)`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n2.  Loop `d` from `n` down to `1`:\n    a.  Let `P_current = dp_arr[d]`.\n    b.  Compute `Q = P_current^2` using NTT. `Q` will be a list of coefficients `W[S]` for `S` up to `2f`. The length of `Q` should be `2f+1`.\n    c.  Compute `SuffixSum` array from `W`: `SuffixSum[S] = (W[S] + SuffixSum[S+1]) % MOD` for `S` from `2f` down to `0`. `SuffixSum[2f+1] = 0`.\n    d.  Initialize `dp_next` (for `dp_arr[d-1]`) as a list of size `f+1` with zeros.\n    e.  For `val` from `0` to `f`:\n        If `val > k`, `dp_next[val] = 0`.\n        Else, `dp_next[val] = (W[val] * (k - val + 1) + SuffixSum[val+1]) % MOD`.\n    f.  Set `dp_arr[d-1] = dp_next`.\n\n3.  After the loop, `dp_arr[1]` contains the necessary counts.\n    a.  Let `P_final = dp_arr[1]`.\n    b.  Compute `Q_final = P_final^2` using NTT.\n    c.  The answer is `Q_final[f]`.\n\n**NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) Details:**\n*   Modulo `MOD = 998244353`.\n*   Primitive root `G = 3`.\n*   The length of polynomials for NTT must be a power of 2. The maximum degree needed for `P_d(x)` is `f`, so `P_d(x)` has `f+1` coefficients. `P_d(x)^2` will have degree `2f`, so `2f+1` coefficients.\n*   For `f = 2 * 10^5`, `2f + 1 = 4 * 10^5 + 1`. The smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to this is `2^19 = 524288`.\n*   `n` iterations of DP, each involves an NTT multiplication of `O(f log f)`. Total time complexity: `O(n * f log f)`.\n    `15 * 2*10^5 * log(2*10^5)` is approximately `15 * 2*10^5 * 18 = 5.4 * 10^7`, which is feasible within typical time limits.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\nG = 3  # Primitive root modulo MOD\n\ndef pow_mod(base, exp, mod):\n    res = 1\n    base %= mod\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % mod\n        base = (base * base) % mod\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    # Bit-reversal permutation\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    # Iterative butterfly operations\n    length = 2\n    while length <= n:\n        wlen = pow_mod(G, (MOD - 1) // length, MOD)\n        if invert:\n            wlen = pow_mod(wlen, MOD - 2, MOD) # Inverse of wlen\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, length):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(length // 2):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + length // 2] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + length // 2] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n        length <<= 1\n    \n    # Scale for inverse NTT\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = pow_mod(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\ndef multiply_polys(p1, p2, target_degree):\n    # p1 and p2 are lists of coefficients, representing polynomials\n    # target_degree is the maximum degree of the result we care about (f or 2f)\n    \n    len1 = len(p1)\n    len2 = len(p2)\n    \n    # Determine NTT size, must be power of 2 and >= len1 + len2 - 1\n    n_ntt = 1\n    while n_ntt < len1 + len2 - 1:\n        n_ntt <<= 1\n    \n    a = list(p1) + [0] * (n_ntt - len1)\n    b = list(p2) + [0] * (n_ntt - len2)\n    \n    ntt(a, False) # Forward transform\n    ntt(b, False) # Forward transform\n    \n    c = [(a[i] * b[i]) % MOD for i in range(n_ntt)]\n    \n    ntt(c, True) # Inverse transform\n    \n    # Truncate to target_degree + 1 coefficients\n    return c[:target_degree + 1]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # dp_arr represents dp_arr[d] in the explanation\n    # It stores the counts for current depth d\n    # dp_arr[val] = number of ways to get max_size = val for a node at current depth\n    \n    # Base case: d = n (strings of length n)\n    # V(s) = c_s.
