He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Analyzing Trailing Zeroes in Factorials for a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem where I need to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends in exactly `m` zeroes. The output wants the count of such `n`'s and then the `n` values themselves in ascending order. My first thought is to figure out how to efficiently count those trailing zeroes.\n\nI know the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of factors of 10, which is the same as counting the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of `n!`. Since there are always more 2s than 5s, it boils down to counting the 5s.\n\nLegendre's formula gives me a way to calculate this: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`, going on as long as `5^k` is less than or equal to `n`. This function, `Z(n)`, is critical, and I need to understand its behavior.\n\nI can see that `Z(n)` is non-decreasing. It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5. It starts at 0 and grows, but it doesn't increase by 1 every time. For example, `Z(24)` is 4, but `Z(25)` is 6. This jumps in values means that `Z(n)` skips some values.\n\nI get it! When `n` is a multiple of `5^k` but not `5^(k+1)`, `Z(n)` increases by `k` compared to `Z(n-1)`. This skipping behavior is key. I'll need to use this to efficiently search for the values of `n` that yield a specific number of trailing zeroes.\n",
