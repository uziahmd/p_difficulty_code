And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**A Python Script for Average Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The challenge here is to figure out the average sleep time over a series of \"weeks,\" where a week is defined as a consecutive set of `k` days, and we have `n` days of sleep data. I need a Python script to do this efficiently.\n\nMy first thought is to identify all the possible weeks, calculate the total sleep time for each, and then average these sums.  There are `n - k + 1` possible weeks in a dataset of `n` days with a week length of `k`.\n\nA naive solution involves looping through each week, calculating the sum of sleep times for that week by iterating through `k` days, and then averaging the sums. But, this `O(n*k)` approach would be too slow because `n` and `k` can be large.\n\nThen, it hit me: this is a sliding window problem!  I can calculate the sum of the first week, and then cleverly derive the sum for each subsequent week by subtracting the departing element and adding the new element.  This is a significant optimization, bringing the complexity down to `O(n)`.\n\nHere's the plan: first calculate the initial sum for the first `k` days.  Then, in a loop, for each subsequent week, subtract the sleep time of the departing day and add the sleep time of the new day.  This updated sum becomes the sleep sum for the next window. I continue this operation until I have summed up the sleep times for all the `n - k + 1` weeks. Finally, I will divide by `n - k + 1` to find the average sleep time over all weeks.  It's simply `TotalSum / (n - k + 1)`. That should do it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\". A week is defined as `k` consecutive days. Given `n` days of sleep records `a1, a2, ..., an`, there will be `n - k + 1` such weeks.\n\nLet's denote the sleep times as a 0-indexed array `a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]`.\nThe `i`-th week (0-indexed) consists of sleep times `a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[i+k-1]`.\nLet `S_i` be the sum of sleep times for the `i`-th week.\nThe first week (index 0) has sum `S_0 = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]`.\nThe second week (index 1) has sum `S_1 = a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[k]`.\n...\nThe last week (index `n-k`) has sum `S_{n-k} = a[n-k] + a[n-k+1] + ... + a[n-1]`.\n\nThe problem asks for the average of these weekly sums. That is, `(S_0 + S_1 + ... + S_{n-k}) / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nA naive approach would be to calculate each `S_i` by summing `k` elements, which takes `O(k)` time. Doing this for all `n - k + 1` weeks would result in a total time complexity of `O((n - k + 1) * k)`. Given `n` can be up to `2 * 10^5`, this could be `O(n^2)` in the worst case (e.g., `k = n/2`), which is `(2 * 10^5)^2 = 4 * 10^{10}` operations, too slow.\n\nWe can use a sliding window technique to calculate `S_i` efficiently.\n1. Calculate `S_0` by summing the first `k` elements: `current_week_sum = sum(a[0:k])`. This takes `O(k)` time.\n2. Initialize `total_sum_of_weeks = current_week_sum`.\n3. For subsequent weeks, `S_{i+1}` can be derived from `S_i` in `O(1)` time:\n   `S_{i+1} = S_i - a[i] + a[i+k]`.\n   This means we subtract the element leaving the window (`a[i]`) and add the element entering the window (`a[i+k]`).\n4. We iterate `i` from `0` to `n-k-1` (to calculate `S_1` through `S_{n-k}`). In each step:\n   - Update `current_week_sum` using the sliding window formula.\n   - Add the new `current_week_sum` to `total_sum_of_weeks`.\n\nThis approach has an initial `O(k)` step and then `n-k` steps each taking `O(1)` time. The total time complexity is `O(k + (n-k)) = O(n)`, which is efficient enough for `n = 2 * 10^5`.\n\nThe maximum value for `total_sum_of_weeks` can be `(n-k+1) * k * max(ai)`.\nWith `n=2*10^5, k=1, max(ai)=10^5`, `total_sum_of_weeks` can be `2*10^5 * 1 * 10^5 = 2*10^{10}`. This fits within a 64-bit integer type (like Python's arbitrary precision integers).\nThe final division should be performed using floating-point numbers to maintain precision.\n\nExample walk-through: `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`\n1. `current_week_sum = a[0] + a[1] = 3 + 4 = 7`. (This is `S_0`)\n2. `total_sum_of_weeks = 7`.\n3. Loop `i` from `0` to `n-k-1 = 3-2-1 = 0`.\n   - `i = 0`: (calculate `S_1`)\n     `current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[0] + a[0+k] = 7 - a[0] + a[2] = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11`.\n     `total_sum_of_weeks = total_sum_of_weeks + 11 = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n4. Loop finishes.\n5. Number of weeks `num_weeks = n - k + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n6. Average = `total_sum_of_weeks / num_weeks = 18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Edge case: If k is equal to n, there's only one week\n    if k == n:\n        print(f\"{sum(a) / 1:.10f}\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the first k elements (first week's sum)\n    current_week_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n    total_sum_of_weeks = current_week_sum\n\n    # Use a sliding window to calculate sums for subsequent weeks\n    # The loop iterates from the second week's starting index (1) up to the last possible week's starting index (n - k)\n    # The iteration variable 'i' here represents the starting index of the *new* window.\n    # The element leaving the window is a[i-1].\n    # The element entering the window is a[i+k-1].\n    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n        current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sum_of_weeks += current_week_sum\n\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    average = total_sum_of_weeks / num_weeks\n\n    # Output the result formatted to at least 10 decimal places for precision\n    print(f\"{average:.10f}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
