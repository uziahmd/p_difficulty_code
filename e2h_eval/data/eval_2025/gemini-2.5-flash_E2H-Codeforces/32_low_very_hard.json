Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The Array Stabilization Problem: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Array Stabilization\" problem, and I need to figure out the most efficient Python solution. My understanding is solid – we've got an array of integers, and we need to remove a single element to minimize the instability, which is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the remaining array. The constraints are pretty standard, so performance shouldn't be a huge hurdle.\n\nMy initial thought is to explore the extremes. We're trying to minimize `max - min`, and after some thought, it becomes clear that the sorted order of the input array is key to this. I've broken this down into some obvious test cases.\n\n*   If I remove the smallest element, my new minimum would be the next smallest value and the maximum stays as is.\n*   Conversely, if I remove the largest element, I am removing that maximum value and the remaining maximum value would be the next largest element.\n*   If I remove some arbitrary value, the current maximum and minimum would still be present.\n\nLet's say we have the sorted array `A_sorted = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`.  If I remove `a_1`, the instability is `a_n - a_2`. If I remove `a_n`, the instability is `a_{n-1} - a_1`. And if I remove some middle element, I end up with the original array instability `a_n - a_1`.\n\nComparing these, it's clear that removing an intermediate element will always be worse than removing either the smallest or largest, given that `a_1 <= a_2` and `a_{n-1} <= a_n`.\n\nTherefore, the minimal instability must occur from removing either the minimum or the maximum element.  My strategy is to sort the array, calculate the instability for removing the smallest and largest elements, and choose the minimum of those two. This seems like a pretty straightforward and efficient approach, and the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is `O(n log n)`.\n",
