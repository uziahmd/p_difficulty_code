On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so the challenge is this \"A Twisty Movement\" problem. We're given a sequence of 1s and 2s, and we can flip any continuous subsegment of it. Our job is to figure out which flip yields the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the *new* sequence.  The tricky part is that LNDS length is defined by how many 1s you can find before the first two, so it’s basically ‘how many 1s’ + ‘how many 2s’ within an ascending order of 1s and 2s in that sequence.\n\nThe constraints are manageable: sequence length is no more than 2000, and elements are only 1s or 2s. So, the first thought is to just brute-force it.  We’d try all possible segments to flip—that's `O(n^2)` potential flips. For each flip, we calculate the LNDS of the *modified* sequence. But calculating LNDS in a straightforward way would be costly, it takes O(n). That's quickly becomes `O(n^3)` runtime, which is too slow.\n\nSo, here's the clever bit: because the array has only 1s and 2s, finding an LNDS can be optimized! It really becomes a counting problem. If we reverse the segment, all we need to do is efficiently count the number of 1s and 2s. Therefore, we can precompute these values to optimize our searches.\n\nThe core idea is to realize that the LNDS of a sequence of 1s and 2s is the maximum value we get by splitting it at some point ‘k’: it's the number of 1s before ‘k’ plus the number of 2s after ‘k’.  This splits our new array into three sections: the unmodified part *before* the start of the flipped segment, the reversed part, and the unmodified part *after* the flipped section.  I'm calling the first part prefix, reversed segment and suffix, respectively.\n\nWe’re going to iterate through all possible start positions ‘l’ and end positions ‘r’ for our reversal. Inside this loop, we’ll check every possible split point ‘k’, where we take all the 1s up to point ‘k’ and all the 2s after.  We want the best split, or the ‘best k’. In this scenario, we only need to compare and find the maximum k for the reversed segment.\n\nLet me put it in code: We'd precompute \"prefix ones\", \"prefix twos\", and \"suffix twos.\" Within the ‘l’ and ‘r’ loops, we want to maximize the \"prefix ones\" up to the position `l`, the \"prefix ones\" of the reversed segment, the \"prefix twos\" of the reversed segment and the \"suffix twos\" of the array. The maximum value after our reversals is our answer.  This optimization brings us down to `O(n^2)` time complexity, which should be fast enough.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a chosen subsegment `a[l...r]` of the original sequence `a`. The sequence elements are restricted to 1s and 2s.\n\n**Understanding LNDS with only 1s and 2s:**\nA non-decreasing subsequence consisting only of 1s and 2s must be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. This means all chosen 1s must appear before or at the same index as all chosen 2s in the subsequence. To maximize its length, we should pick as many 1s as possible, followed by as many 2s as possible.\nIf we consider a \"split point\" `k` (0-indexed, meaning we take 1s from indices `0` to `k-1` and 2s from indices `k` to `n-1`), the length of the LNDS for a sequence `b` would be `(count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`. The actual LNDS for sequence `b` is the maximum of this sum over all possible split points `k` from `0` to `n`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Precompute prefix/suffix sums:** To efficiently count 1s and 2s, we can precompute:\n    *   `P1[i]`: Count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`. `P1[0]=0`.\n    *   `P2[i]`: Count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`. `P2[0]=0`.\n    *   `S2[i]`: Count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`. `S2[n]=0`.\n\n2.  **Calculate initial LNDS:** The LNDS of the original sequence (without any reversal) is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (P1[k] + S2[k])`. This will be our initial maximum.\n\n3.  **Iterate over all possible reversal intervals `[l, r]`:**\n    The indices `l` and `r` are 0-indexed, so `0 <= l <= r < n`.\n    When `a[l...r]` is reversed, the new sequence `b` looks like:\n    `a[0...l-1] | reversed(a[l...r]) | a[r+1...n-1]`\n\n    For any such `b`, its LNDS is `max_{0 <= k_split <= n} (count_ones(b[0...k_split-1]) + count_twos(b[k_split...n-1]))`.\n    Let's analyze the sum `count_ones(b[0...k_split-1]) + count_twos(b[k_split...n-1])` for different ranges of `k_split`:\n\n    *   **Case 1: `k_split <= l`** (split point is before or at `l`)\n        The prefix `b[0...k_split-1]` is identical to `a[0...k_split-1]`. So `count_ones(b[0...k_split-1]) = P1[k_split]`.\n        The suffix `b[k_split...n-1]` consists of `a[k_split...l-1]`, then `reversed(a[l...r])`, then `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n        The count of 2s in `b[k_split...n-1]` is `(P2[l] - P2[k_split])` (from `a[k_split...l-1]`) + `(P2[r+1] - P2[l])` (from `a[l...r]`, reversal doesn't change count) + `S2[r+1]` (from `a[r+1...n-1]`).\n        So the sum is `P1[k_split] + (P2[l] - P2[k_split]) + (P2[r+1] - P2[l]) + S2[r+1]`.\n        This simplifies to `P1[k_split] - P2[k_split] + P2[r+1] + S2[r+1]`.\n        To maximize this for `k_split <= l`, we need to maximize `P1[k_split] - P2[k_split]`.\n\n    *   **Case 2: `k_split > r`** (split point is after `r`)\n        The prefix `b[0...k_split-1]` consists of `a[0...l-1]`, then `reversed(a[l...r])`, then `a[r+1...k_split-1]`.\n        The count of 1s in `b[0...k_split-1]` is `P1[l]` + `(P1[r+1] - P1[l])` + `(P1[k_split] - P1[r+1])`. This simplifies to `P1[k_split]`. (Reversal changes positions but not counts within the segment `[l,r]`).\n        The suffix `b[k_split...n-1]` is identical to `a[k_split...n-1]`. So `count_twos(b[k_split...n-1]) = S2[k_split]`.\n        The sum is `P1[k_split] + S2[k_split]`. This is the same as the original LNDS calculation for `k_split > r`.\n\n    *   **Case 3: `l < k_split <= r`** (split point is inside the reversed segment)\n        The prefix `b[0...k_split-1]` consists of `a[0...l-1]` and the part of `reversed(a[l...r])` up to `k_split-1`.\n        The part `reversed(a[l...r])` is `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`.\n        The part up to `k_split-1` in `b` means `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[k_split]` (original indices).\n        So `count_ones(b[0...k_split-1]) = P1[l] + (P1[r+1] - P1[k_split])`.\n        The suffix `b[k_split...n-1]` consists of the part of `reversed(a[l...r])` from `k_split` onwards, and `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n        The part from `k_split` onwards in `b` means `a[k_split-1], a[k_split-2], ..., a[l]` (original indices).\n        So `count_twos(b[k_split...n-1]) = (P2[k_split] - P2[l]) + S2[r+1]`.\n        The sum is `P1[l] + P1[r+1] - P1[k_split] + P2[k_split] - P2[l] + S2[r+1]`.\n        This can be rewritten as `(P1[l] - P2[l]) + (P1[r+1] + S2[r+1]) + (P2[k_split] - P1[k_split])`.\n\n    Combining all cases, for a fixed `l, r`, the LNDS of `b` is:\n    `max_{0 <= k_split <= n} (P1[k_split] + S2[k_split])` (for `k_split <= l` or `k_split > r`)\n    and\n    `max_{l < k_split <= r} ((P1[l] - P2[l]) + (P1[r+1] + S2[r+1]) + (P2[k_split] - P1[k_split]))`.\n\n    Let's simplify. The overall LNDS for the modified array `b` can be seen as:\n    `P1[l]` (1s from left part)\n    `+ max_{l <= k_mid <= r+1} ( (P1[r+1] - P1[k_mid]) + (P2[k_mid] - P2[l]) )` (1s and 2s from the reversed segment)\n    `+ S2[r+1]` (2s from right part)\n\n    The term `(P1[r+1] - P1[k_mid])` represents 1s in `a[k_mid...r]` (original indices), which become `a[r], ..., a[k_mid]` in the reversed segment.\n    The term `(P2[k_mid] - P2[l])` represents 2s in `a[l...k_mid-1]` (original indices), which become `a[k_mid-1], ..., a[l]` in the reversed segment.\n    This sum `(P1[r+1] - P1[k_mid]) + (P2[k_mid] - P2[l])` is the LNDS of the *reversed segment itself*, with `k_mid` acting as the split point within that segment (1s are taken from `a[k_mid...r]` and 2s from `a[l...k_mid-1]`).\n\n    So, for a given `l, r`, the LNDS is `P1[l] + S2[r+1] + max_{l <= k_mid <= r+1} ( (P1[r+1] - P1[k_mid]) + (P2[k_mid] - P2[l]) )`.\n    Rearranging the terms inside the `max`:\n    `max_{l <= k_mid <= r+1} ( (P1[r+1] - P2[l]) + (P2[k_mid] - P1[k_mid]) )`.\n    Since `(P1[r+1] - P2[l])` is constant for fixed `l, r`, we need to find `max_{l <= k_mid <= r+1} (P2[k_mid] - P1[k_mid])`.\n\n    Let `val[k] = P2[k] - P1[k]`.\n    The LNDS for a given `l, r` is `P1[l] + S2[r+1] + (P1[r+1] - P2[l]) + max_{l <= k_mid <= r+1} val[k_mid]`.\n\n    **Algorithm (O(N^2) complexity):**\n    1.  Initialize `max_overall_lnds = 0`.\n    2.  Precompute `P1`, `P2`, `S2` arrays of size `n+1`.\n        `P1[i+1] = P1[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)`\n        `P2[i+1] = P2[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)`\n        `S2[i] = S2[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)`\n    3.  Precompute `val[k] = P2[k] - P1[k]` for `k` from `0` to `n`.\n    4.  Calculate initial LNDS (no reversal):\n        `for k from 0 to n: max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, P1[k] + S2[k])`\n    5.  Iterate `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n        Initialize `max_val_in_segment = val[l]`. (This is for `k_mid = l`)\n        Iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n            Update `max_val_in_segment = max(max_val_in_segment, val[r+1])`. (This extends the range for `k_mid` to `r+1`)\n            `current_lnds = P1[l] + S2[r+1] + (P1[r+1] - P2[l]) + max_val_in_segment`\n            `max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, current_lnds)`\n    6.  Print `max_overall_lnds`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Precomputation: `O(N)` for `P1`, `P2`, `S2`, `val`.\n*   Initial LNDS: `O(N)`.\n*   Nested loops for `l` and `r`: `N` iterations for `l`, `N` iterations for `r`. Inside the inner loop, operations are `O(1)`. Total `O(N^2)`.\nOverall time complexity: `O(N^2)`.\nFor `N=2000`, `N^2 = 4 * 10^6`, which is efficient enough for typical time limits (usually 1-2 seconds).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example): `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, `n = 4`**\n\n1.  **Precomputation:**\n    `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`\n    `P1 = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\n    `P2 = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`\n    `S2 = [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]` (S2[0]=2s in a[0..3], S2[1]=2s in a[1..3], etc.)\n    `val = [P2[k] - P1[k]]`\n    `val = [0-0, 0-1, 1-1, 1-2, 2-2]`\n    `val = [0, -1, 0, -1, 0]`\n\n2.  **Initial LNDS (no reversal):**\n    `k=0: P1[0]+S2[0] = 0+2 = 2`\n    `k=1: P1[1]+S2[1] = 1+1 = 2`\n    `k=2: P1[2]+S2[2] = 1+1 = 2`\n    `k=3: P1[3]+S2[3] = 2+1 = 3`\n    `k=4: P1[4]+S2[4] = 2+0 = 2`\n    `max_overall_lnds = 3`\n\n3.  **Reversals:**\n    `l=0`:\n        `r=0`: `a=[1,2,1,2]`. `max_val_in_segment = val[0] = 0`. `max_val_in_segment = max(0, val[1]=-1) = 0`.\n                 `current_lnds = P1[0]+S2[1]+(P1[1]-P2[0])+0 = 0+1+(1-0)+0 = 2`. `max_overall_lnds = max(3,2)=3`.\n        `r=1`: `a=[2,1,1,2]`. `max_val_in_segment = max(0, val[2]=0) = 0`.\n                 `current_lnds = P1[0]+S2[2]+(P1[2]-P2[0])+0 = 0+1+(1-0)+0 = 2`. `max_overall_lnds = max(3,2)=3`.\n        `r=2`: `a=[1,2,1,2]` reversed `[1,2,1]` is `[1,1,2]`. `b = [1,1,2,2]`. `max_val_in_segment = max(0, val[3]=-1) = 0`.\n                 `current_lnds = P1[0]+S2[3]+(P1[3]-P2[0])+0 = 0+1+(2-0)+0 = 3`. `max_overall_lnds = max(3,3)=3`.\n        `r=3`: `a=[1,2,1,2]` reversed `[1,2,1,2]` is `[2,1,2,1]`. `b = [2,1,2,1]`. `max_val_in_segment = max(0, val[4]=0) = 0`.\n                 `current_lnds = P1[0]+S2[4]+(P1[4]-P2[0])+0 = 0+0+(2-0)+0 = 2`. `max_overall_lnds = max(3,2)=3`.\n    `l=1`: `max_val_in_segment = val[1] = -1`.\n        `r=1`: `a=[1,2,1,2]` reversed `[2]` is `[2]`. `b = [1,2,1,2]`. `max_val_in_segment = max(-1, val[2]=0) = 0`.\n                 `current_lnds = P1[1]+S2[2]+(P1[2]-P2[1])+0 = 1+1+(1-0)+0 = 3`. `max_overall_lnds = max(3,3)=3`.\n        `r=2`: `a=[1,2,1,2]` reversed `[2,1]` is `[1,2]`. `b = [1,1,2,2]`. `max_val_in_segment = max(0, val[3]=-1) = 0`.\n                 `current_lnds = P1[1]+S2[3]+(P1[3]-P2[1])+0 = 1+1+(2-0)+0 = 4`. `max_overall_lnds = max(3,4)=4`.\n        `r=3`: `a=[1,2,1,2]` reversed `[2,1,2]` is `[2,1,2]`. `b = [1,2,1,2]`. `max_val_in_segment = max(0, val[4]=0) = 0`.\n                 `current_lnds = P1[1]+S2[4]+(P1[4]-P2[1])+0 = 1+0+(2-0)+0 = 3`. `max_overall_lnds = max(4,3)=4`.\n    ... and so on for `l=2, 3`.\n\nThe maximum found is 4.
