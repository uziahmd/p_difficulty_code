    "thought": "**My Analytical Journey Through This Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nMy primary goal here is to determine the sum of a specific function, *d(1,n)*, across all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. \"Good\" trees are defined as having edge weights of +1 or -1, with the critical constraint that for each vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges must equal -1.  The problem's structure necessitates a keen understanding of graph theory and modular arithmetic.\n\nInitially, I focused on understanding the core properties of \"good\" trees. By analyzing the product of the vertex conditions across all vertices, I deduced that a \"good\" tree can only exist if the number of vertices, *n*, is even.  This immediately gives me a zero result for all odd inputs.  This constraint on *n* then becomes a central pivot point for the remaining analysis.\n\nWith *n* even, I shifted my focus to constructing such good trees and efficiently calculating *d(1, n)*. I considered assigning weights to the edges, recognizing that any tree structure can be made good. I represented the weight of each edge with a binary variable (0 or 1), leveraging modular arithmetic (GF(2)) to express the vertex condition as a system of linear equations.  This analysis affirmed the requirement of even *n* for solutions. For any given spanning tree, the linear system with *n* even has one solution, confirming the count of *n^(n-2)*.\n\nThe next critical step was to calculate *d(1,n)*, which is the sum of edge weights on the unique path from vertex 1 to vertex n. I considered linearity to split the computation over all edges, then all trees. I recognize the challenge: How often is a specific edge on the shortest path between nodes 1 and *n*? This is where the core computational challenge lies. I explored ways to express the number of good trees containing a specified edge on the path from 1 to *n*.\n\nI tried several techniques, including applying the Prüfer code, the Matrix Tree theorem, and path generating function to count the number of trees with specific structures, or to determine how a change in edge weight would influence the total sum. However, these techniques did not yield an elegant result. I reasoned about this probability directly by considering the constraints of the graph and the influence of each edge on the structure of the good tree, attempting to apply inclusion-exclusion. I formulated a method to count the contribution of each edge to the final answer. This involves looking at the edge weight and the possible trees where it appears in a path from node 1 to node *n*.\n\nMy ultimate objective is to count trees where a fixed edge e lies on the unique path from node 1 to node *n*.  I need to determine the count of trees such that a particular edge exists and is on the unique path from the starting node to the ending node. However, computing the path count is quite challenging due to the dependence on the assignments of positive and negative edge weights.\n\nThe final insight involves calculating the probability that a specific edge is on the path from 1 to n. The count of such edge is related to the count of the nodes in either component created by removing it from the graph. I need to calculate, for any tree, how many nodes from the original tree are present and where they're located. This can be calculated using the matrix-tree theorem. This direction seemed very close to the optimal way of formulating the solution.\n\nThe problem, ultimately, can be simplified to counting the number of trees. The complexity remains in applying efficient graph traversal algorithms for large datasets. I understand that the key insight here is to apply linearity, carefully account for edge contributions, apply known properties of tree structures (such as Prüfer sequence), and carefully analyze the equation system.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of `d(1, n)` over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. An edge-weighted tree is \"good\" if each edge has weight 1 or -1, and for each vertex `i`, the product of weights of all edges incident to `i` is -1. `d(u,v)` is the sum of weights of edges on the unique path between `u` and `v`.\n\nLet `w(e)` be the weight of an edge `e`. The condition for a tree to be good is `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1` for all vertices `i`.\n\n**1. Condition for existence of good trees:**\nConsider the product of these conditions over all vertices:\n`product_{i=1 to n} (product_{e incident to i} w(e)) = product_{i=1 to n} (-1)`\nThe right side is `(-1)^n`.\nOn the left side, each edge `e=(u,v)` contributes `w(e)` to the product for vertex `u` and `w(e)` to the product for vertex `v`. So `w(e)` appears twice. Thus, the left side is `product_{e in E} (w(e)^2)`. Since `w(e)` is either 1 or -1, `w(e)^2 = 1`. So the left side is `1`.\nTherefore, we must have `1 = (-1)^n`. This implies that `n` must be an even number.\nIf `n` is odd, no good trees exist, so the sum of `d(1,n)` is 0. This covers the `n=1` case in the example.\n\n**2. Number of good weight assignments for a fixed tree structure:**\nAssume `n` is even. For a fixed tree structure `T`, how many ways are there to assign weights `w(e) in {1, -1}` to make it good?\nLet `y_e = 0` if `w(e) = 1`, and `y_e = 1` if `w(e) = -1`. Then `w(e) = (-1)^{y_e}`.\nThe condition `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1` becomes `product_{e incident to i} (-1)^{y_e} = -1`, which simplifies to `sum_{e incident to i} y_e = 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations over `GF(2)` with `n-1` variables (one for each edge).\nAs shown in standard graph theory, for a connected graph (a tree, in this case), this system has a solution if and only if the sum of the right-hand sides is even. Here, all right-hand sides are 1, so their sum is `n`. Since `n` is even, a solution exists.\nFurthermore, for a tree, the incidence matrix (excluding one row, for example, the row for vertex `n`) has full rank `n-1`. This means the `n-1` variables `y_e` are uniquely determined by the `n-1` equations (after removing one redundant equation, e.g., for vertex `n`).\nSo, for any fixed tree structure `T` (when `n` is even), there is exactly one way to assign weights to make it good.\nThe total number of distinct good trees is `n^(n-2)` (the number of tree structures) multiplied by 1.\n\n**3. Calculating `d(1,n)` for a good tree:**\n`d(1,n) = sum_{e in P_{1,n}} w(e) = sum_{e in P_{1,n}} (-1)^{y_e}`.\nWe need to sum this value over all `n^(n-2)` good trees.\nBy linearity of summation, we can swap the sums:\n`S = sum_{T good} sum_{e in P_{1,n}(T)} (-1)^{y_T(e)} = sum_{u,v: u!=v} sum_{T good: (u,v) in P_{1,n}(T)} (-1)^{y_T(u,v)}`.\nThis approach is complicated because `y_T(u,v)` depends on the entire tree structure `T`.\n\nLet's use a known property of `y_e` values. For any cut `(X, V \\setminus X)`, `sum_{e in delta(X)} y_e = |X| (mod 2)`.\nConsider the path `P_{1,n}`. Let `e=(u,v)` be an edge on this path. Removing `e` splits `T` into two components, `T_u` containing `u` and `T_v` containing `v`. Since `e` is on `P_{1,n}`, `1` must be in one component and `n` in the other. Assume `1` is in `T_u` and `n` is in `T_v`.\nLet `X` be the set of vertices in `T_u`. Then `delta(X) = {e}`.\nSo `y_e = |X| (mod 2)`.\nThe number of vertices in `T_u` is `k`. So `y_e = k (mod 2)`.\nThis means `w(e) = (-1)^k`.\n\nWe need to sum `d(1,n) = sum_{e in P_{1,n}} (-1)^k_e`, where `k_e` is the size of the component containing `1` when `e` is removed from `P_{1,n}`.\nThe sum is `sum_{T good} sum_{e=(u,v) in P_{1,n}(T)} (-1)^{k_e(T)}`.\nThis can be rewritten as `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} sum_{e=(u,v)} sum_{T: e in P_{1,n}(T) and k_e(T)=k} (-1)^k`.\nThe number of trees where `e=(u,v)` is on `P_{1,n}` and removing `e` creates components of size `k` (containing `1`) and `n-k` (containing `n`) is given by the formula:\n`N(k) = binom(n-2, k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1)`.\nThis formula counts trees where `1` is in `u`'s component, `n` is in `v`'s component, and `u`'s component has `k` vertices, `v`'s component has `n-k` vertices. The specific edge `(u,v)` is chosen implicitly by the formula.\nThis `N(k)` is the number of trees `T` such that `P_{1,n}(T)` contains an edge `e` where `1`'s side of the cut has size `k`.\nThe sum becomes `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} N(k) * (-1)^k`.\n\nSo the answer is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} binom(n-2, k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * (-1)^k`.\nThis formula is valid for `n >= 2`.\n\n**Special cases:**\n*   If `n=1`: The answer is `0` (as `n` is odd). `d(1,1)=0`.\n*   If `n=2`: The formula sum is for `k=1`.\n    `binom(0, 0) * 1^(1-1) * (2-1)^(2-1-1) * (-1)^1`\n    `= 1 * 1^0 * 1^0 * (-1) = -1`.\n    For `n=2`, there is only one tree: `1-2`. `deg(1)=1, deg(2)=1`.\n    `w(1,2) = -1` for `1`'s condition. `w(1,2) = -1` for `2`'s condition.\n    So `w(1,2)=-1`. `d(1,2)=-1`. This matches.\n\n**Final formula:**\nIf `n` is odd, answer is `0`.\nIf `n` is even, answer is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} binom(n-2, k-1) * k^(k-1) * (n-k)^(n-k-1) * (-1)^k`.\nThe sum starts from `k=1` and goes up to `n-1`. Note that `k=1` implies `k-1=0`, and `k^(k-1)` becomes `1^0=1`. `(n-k)^(n-k-1)` for `k=1` is `(n-1)^(n-2)`.\nFor `k=n-1`, `k-1=n-2`, and `(n-k)^(n-k-1)` becomes `1^0=1`.\nThe terms `k^(k-1)` and `(n-k)^(n-k-1)` are evaluated as `1` when the exponent is `0` and base is `1`. For `k=0` or `k=n`, `k^(k-1)` would be `0^something`, which is `0`. But `k` is from `1` to `n-1`, so `k` and `n-k` are always positive.\nThe powers `k^(k-1)` are calculated using modular exponentiation.\nThe binomial coefficients `binom(n-2, k-1)` require precomputing factorials and inverse factorials.\n\n**Modulo arithmetic:**\nAll calculations should be done modulo `998244353`. This is a prime number.\n`a^b mod M` can be computed efficiently.\n`binom(N, K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!) = N! * (K!)^(M-2) * ((N-K)!)^(M-2) mod M`.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  If `n % 2 != 0` (n is odd), print `0`.\n3.  If `n == 1`, print `0`. (This is covered by `n % 2 != 0`).\n4.  If `n == 0`, this is not possible based on constraints `1 <= n`.\n5.  If `n == 2`, the formula gives `-1`.\n6.  Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to `n-2`.\n    `fact[i] = i!`\n    `invfact[i] = (i!)^(-1) mod MOD`\n7.  Define `nCr(N, R) = fact[N] * invfact[R] * invfact[N-R] mod MOD`.\n8.  Initialize `total_sum = 0`.\n9.  Loop `k` from `1` to `n-1`:\n    a.  `term = nCr(n-2, k-1)`\n    b.  `term = (term * pow(k, k-1, MOD)) % MOD`\n    c.  `term = (term * pow(n-k, n-k-1, MOD)) % MOD`\n    d.  If `k` is odd, `total_sum = (total_sum - term + MOD) % MOD`.\n    e.  If `k` is even, `total_sum = (total_sum + term) % MOD`.\n10. Print `total_sum`.\n\n**Edge case `n=1`**:\nInput `n=1`. Output `0`. My logic `n % 2 != 0` handles this.\n\n**Edge case `n=2`**:\nInput `n=2`. Output `998244352` (which is -1 mod 998244353).\nLoop `k` from `1` to `1`:\n`k=1`:\n`nCr(0, 0) = 1`\n`pow(1, 1-1, MOD) = pow(1, 0, MOD) = 1`\n`pow(2-1, 2-1-1, MOD) = pow(1, 0, MOD) = 1`\n`term = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1`.\n`k=1` is odd, `total_sum = (0 - 1 + MOD) % MOD = -1 % MOD`.\nResult is `-1`. Correct.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\nPrecomputation: `O(N log MOD)` for inverse factorials or `O(N)` if using `invfact[N] = pow(fact[N], MOD-2, MOD)` and then `invfact[i-1] = invfact[i] * i % MOD`.\nLoop: `N-1` iterations. Each iteration involves `nCr` (constant time after precomputation) and two `pow` operations (`log MOD` each).\nTotal: `O(N log MOD)`.\n`N = 5 * 10^5`, `log MOD` is around `30`. So `5 * 10^5 * 30` is `1.5 * 10^7`, which is acceptable.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    MOD = 998244353\n\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # For n=2, the sum is -1.\n    # The loop for n=2 runs for k=1.\n    # n-2 = 0. binom(0, 0) = 1.\n    # k^(k-1) = 1^0 = 1.\n    # (n-k)^(n-k-1) = (2-1)^(2-1-1) = 1^0 = 1.\n    # term = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.\n    # k=1 is odd, total_sum = (0 - 1 + MOD) % MOD = -1.
