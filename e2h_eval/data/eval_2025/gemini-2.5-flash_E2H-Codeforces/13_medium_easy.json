For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey: Classifying Triads**\n\nAlright, so I've got this problem: a three-note chord, and I need to figure out if it's major, minor, or just... *strange*.  My initial thought is, this seems straightforward.  It's just applying the definitions, right?\n\nFirst, I need to represent the notes.  Mapping those note names (C, C#, D, etc.) to numbers 0 through 11 makes the math much easier.  Then, calculating the distance between two notes becomes simple modular arithmetic:  `(note2 - note1 + 12) % 12`. This handles the cyclical nature of the notes.\n\nThe crux of the matter is the triad definition. A major triad *must* have intervals of 4 and 3 semitones (or 3 and 4, for a minor triad), in *that* specific order.  The \"strange\" ones are everything else. Since this is an *unordered* set of notes, I initially figured I'd sort them, calculate the cyclic distances between adjacent notes, and then match those distances to the major/minor patterns. The pattern turned out to be (4,3,5) for major, (3,4,5) for minor\n\nBut, the definition is a bit more strict than that. The problem statement says the notes must be ordered where the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones and Y and Z is 3 semitones for a major triad.  So, I quickly realized that doesn't work. The notes need to be considered in every possible order.\n\nSo, I thought, okay, let's just brute-force it.  Since there are only three notes, there are only six possible orderings. For each permutation of notes, I'll calculate the semitone distance and see if it fits the major/minor definition. It's not the most elegant solution, but it's guaranteed to work, and the problem explicitly states there's an unambiguous answer.  I can use `itertools.permutations` in Python. I'll make sure to calculate distance, and check for the major and minor conditions. Also, since only one of these could happen, I can stop as soon as I get a match.\n\nI'll iterate through each permutation of the three input notes. For each permutation, I can calculate the distance between the first and second note (`X` and `Y`) and then the second and third note (`Y` and `Z`). If the two calculated distances are (4,3) it's a major triad. If it's (3,4) it's a minor triad. Anything else is strange.\n\nThis direct approach, directly matching the definitions, is the most robust and clear way to handle this. It will be efficient for this task. I believe it's correct. Let's test it out!\n",
