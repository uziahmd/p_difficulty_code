Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on Tackling the Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem involving string substitutions and modular arithmetic. My initial thought is that a straightforward string replacement approach is going to be far too inefficient.  The potential for exponential growth in the string length with repeated substitutions immediately sets off alarm bells. I need a way to calculate the final number without explicitly constructing the final, potentially massive, string.\n\n**Breaking Down the Problem & Identifying Challenges**\n\nThe problem has three key parts: (1) An initial string of digits, (2) a series of queries that replace digits with other strings, and (3) a final calculation where the resulting string is interpreted as a number, modulo 10^9 + 7.  The constraints (string length, number of queries, length of replacement strings) guide my thinking about performance.\n\nThe trick is clearly in the iterative replacement process. For instance, if '1' becomes '11', and we have a string like \"1\", then each application makes it twice the size (1 -> 11 -> 1111 -> etc). That could explode.\n\n**Seeking a Smarter Approach: Dynamic Programming or Backwards Reasoning?**\n\nMy mind immediately gravitates towards dynamic programming or a \"work backwards\" strategy. Since the queries are applied sequentially, the *order* of the substitutions matters a lot.  A digit '0' created by a previous replacement needs to be transformed by subsequent rules. This non-independence is crucial.\n\n**Focusing on Digit Transformations and the Reverse Order Trick**\n\nI'm thinking if I can work out the final value of each digit after all the substitutions, I can then calculate the final result directly from the initial string.  This leads me to considering a *reverse* processing of the queries. In the reversed order, the last query determines the final transformation of the digit it affects. This is key because that query isn't being affected by any other rule down the line.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of the Reverse Approach**\n\nI figure I need to maintain, for each digit 0-9, a `val` (its final numeric value) and a `len` (its final length) after all substitutions. I can then take the original string, and substitute the original number and length. If `len` is longer than the number of queries, that suggests the string exploded. I'll need to use modulo arithmetic for the `val`, the length should be `(length % MOD - 1)`.\n\n**Implementing the Solution: A Reverse Query Algorithm**\n\nAlright, I'm thinking of initializing `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1` for each digit. I'll then process the queries backward: for each query `di -> ti`, I determine the new `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on the string `ti`. Each digit in `ti` will then in turn have their transformation. The resulting calculation is `new_val_di = (new_val_di * 10^current_len[c] + current_val[c]) % MOD`.\n\nAfter going through all of that, the value of the digit is `val`. Then process the original string `s` using the final `current_val` and `current_len` values. The final calculations involve: `(final_val * 10^current_len[d] + current_val[d]) % MOD`.\n\n**Addressing Potential Issues & Edge Cases**\n\nI'm trying to look at the edge cases:\n- Empty strings `ti`: should result in a digit transforming into a '0' of length 0.\n- `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n- The string `s` could have multiple values that translate to the same number. In particular, it can have multiple leading zeroes and an empty string will be assumed to be 0.\nI'll pay extra attention to ensuring the modular arithmetic and length calculations are correct. Fermat's little theorem helps with `pow(10, length, MOD)`.\n\n**Optimization and Time Complexity**\n\nThe time complexity appears to be `O((|s| + sum(|ti|)) * log(MOD))`. The `log` part comes from the `pow` function, which is the main bottle neck. `log(10^9)` is approximately 30. The algorithm scales linearly with the total length of all the query strings and the length of the original string, meaning it's highly performant.\n\n**Implementation and Testing**\n\nI'll now translate these thoughts into Python code. I will include thorough testing of the edge cases, including `0` in the string, zero strings, and many tests on large numbers. I'll also try test cases from the sample inputs.\n",
    "response": "The provided Python script solves the problem by processing the substitution queries in reverse order. This approach is necessary because a substitution `di -> ti` can introduce new digits into the string, and these new digits might themselves be subject to further substitutions by *earlier* queries. By processing queries in reverse, we ensure that when we determine the final value and length for a digit `di`, any digits appearing in its replacement string `ti` have already been transformed according to all *subsequent* queries.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Modulo Constant**: `MOD = 1000000007` is defined for all calculations.\n2.  **Length Modulo**: `LEN_MOD = MOD - 1` is used for exponentiation of `10`. By Fermat's Little Theorem, `a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)` for a prime `p`. This means `10^L ≡ 10^(L % (p-1)) (mod p)`. This prevents the length from growing too large and ensures that `pow(10, length, MOD)` calculations remain efficient. `0 % (MOD-1)` is `0`, so `pow(10, 0, MOD)` correctly evaluates to `1`.\n3.  **Initial Mappings**: Two arrays, `current_val` and `current_len`, are initialized.\n    *   `current_val[d]` stores the numeric value of the digit `d` after all transformations. Initially, `d` maps to itself, so `current_val[d] = d`.\n    *   `current_len[d]` stores the length of the string representation of `d` after all transformations. Initially, a single digit has length `1`, so `current_len[d] = 1`.\n4.  **Processing Queries in Reverse**:\n    *   The queries are stored and then iterated from the last query to the first.\n    *   For each query `di -> ti`:\n        *   `new_val_di` and `new_len_di` are calculated based on the string `ti`.\n        *   We iterate through each character `char_t` in `ti`.\n        *   For each `char_t`, we retrieve its *already transformed* value (`current_val[digit_t]`) and length (`current_len[digit_t]`).\n        *   The `new_val_di` is updated using the formula: `(previous_value * 10^segment_length + segment_value) % MOD`. The `10^segment_length` is calculated using `pow(10, current_len[digit_t], MOD)`.\n        *   The `new_len_di` is updated by summing the `current_len[digit_t]` values, modulo `LEN_MOD`.\n        *   After processing all characters in `ti`, `current_val[di]` and `current_len[di]` are updated with `new_val_di` and `new_len_di`.\n5.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   After all queries have been processed, `current_val` and `current_len` hold the final transformation rules for each digit.\n    *   The initial string `s` is then processed from left to right.\n    *   `final_result_val` is accumulated using the same formula as in query processing: `(final_result_val * 10^segment_length + segment_value) % MOD`.\n    *   The final `final_result_val` is the answer.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially exponential growth of the string length by working with aggregated values and lengths rather than explicit string manipulation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        parts = line.split(\"->\")\n        d_i = parts[0]\n        t_i = parts[1]\n        queries.append((d_i, t_i))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    # For exponentiation, we use (MOD - 1) as the modulus for lengths\n    # by Fermat's Little Theorem: a^(p-1) = 1 (mod p) for prime p.\n    # So 10^L = 10^(L % (MOD - 1)) (mod MOD).\n    # If L is 0, 10^0 = 1. 0 % (MOD-1) = 0. pow(10, 0, MOD) = 1.
