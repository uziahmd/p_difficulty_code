On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Breaking Down \"A Twisty Movement\" - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem, \"A Twisty Movement.\" Seems straightforward on the surface, but I know competitive programming can throw curveballs. The core is manipulating a sequence of 1s and 2s by reversing intervals to maximize the length of the Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS). My initial thought is, this is definitely a dynamic programming or maybe a clever greedy problem.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand the constraints. We've got `n` up to 2000, which suggests a runtime complexity of, at most, `O(n^3)` if I'm clever, maybe a little more if I'm not. Let's start with a brute-force approach, see what that gives. I can iterate through all possible intervals `[l, r]`, reverse them, and then compute the LNDS.\n\nThe key to this sequence seems to be: since the sequence contains only 1s and 2s, the LNDS must be all 1s followed by all 2s. So finding the LNDS really is just counting how many 1s I can put before a dividing point and how many 2s I can put after that dividing point. That observation makes LNDS computation more efficient than a generic sequence. A simple linear scan should do the trick.\n\nIf I'm reversing a segment, I need to be careful to ensure the reversed segment's 1s are before the 2s, to optimize the LNDS. So for each possible reversal, I need to calculate the LNDS, which means I might need `O(n^2)` computation. But, to make it work, I must iterate and test every possible reverse (of size, say, `O(n^2)`). If I use simple reversal, this will take, at worst, `O(N)` to reverse, so `O(N^3)` at a worst case, given this.\n\nThe crucial observation is the special structure of the sequence. Any LNDS I create will be a block of 1s followed by a block of 2s. That is the thing to exploit. Now I just need to figure out the best split point, or, how to use that property to build an efficient way to compute LNDS. Maybe a prefix sum approach to calculate those 1s and 2s?\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a single subsegment `a[l...r]` of the original sequence `a`. The sequence elements `a_i` can only be 1 or 2.\n\n**Understanding LNDS for sequences of 1s and 2s:**\nA non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of only 1s and 2s must consist of zero or more 1s, followed by zero or more 2s. For example, `1, 1, 2, 2` is non-decreasing, but `1, 2, 1` is not. To maximize the length of such a subsequence, we need to find a \"split point\" `i` (0-indexed, meaning after `a[i]`) such that we take all 1s from `a[0...i]` and all 2s from `a[i+1...n-1]`. The LNDS length for a given sequence `b` would be `(count of 1s in b[0...i]) + (count of 2s in b[i+1...n-1])`. We iterate `i` from -1 (taking all 2s) to `n-1` (taking all 1s) to find the maximum.\n\n**Optimized LNDS Calculation:**\nLet's precompute:\n1.  `prefix_ones[k]`: The number of 1s in `b[0...k-1]`.\n2.  `suffix_twos[k]`: The number of 2s in `b[k...n-1]`.\n\nThen, for each possible split point `i` (representing the point *after* index `i` where 1s end and 2s begin), the LNDS length is `prefix_ones[i+1] + suffix_twos[i+1]`. The maximum over all `i` (from -1 to `n-1`) gives the LNDS length.\n*   For `i = -1`: We take no 1s. LNDS length is `suffix_twos[0]` (total 2s).\n*   For `i = n-1`: We take all 1s. LNDS length is `prefix_ones[n]` (total 1s).\nThis calculation takes `O(N)` time for a given sequence `b`.\n\n**Overall Algorithm:**\nSince `N` is up to 2000, `N^2` possible intervals `[l, r]` exist.\n`N^2` intervals * `O(N)` for reversal * `O(N)` for LNDS calculation = `O(N^4)`, which is too slow (`2000^4 = 1.6 * 10^13`).\nWe need a more efficient approach.\n\nNotice that the reversal only affects the segment `a[l...r]`. The elements `a[0...l-1]` and `a[r+1...n-1]` remain unchanged.\nLet's iterate through all possible `l` and `r` (there are `N^2` pairs).\nFor each `(l, r)`:\n1.  Create the modified sequence `b`. This involves copying `a[0...l-1]`, then `a[r...l]` (reversed), then `a[r+1...n-1]`. This takes `O(N)` time.\n2.  Calculate the LNDS for `b`. This takes `O(N)` time using prefix sums and suffix sums.\n\nThis gives `O(N^4)` if we recompute prefix/suffix sums for each `b`.\nHowever, we can optimize the LNDS calculation for `b`.\nLet `b` be the sequence after reversing `a[l...r]`.\nThe LNDS will be of the form `(1s before l) + (1s in reversed segment) + (2s in reversed segment) + (2s after r)`.\nMore precisely, an LNDS can be formed by picking a split point `k`.\n*   If `k < l`: We take all 1s from `a[0...k]`, and all 2s from `a[k+1...n-1]`. The reversal doesn't affect this.\n*   If `k > r`: We take all 1s from `a[0...k]`, and all 2s from `a[k+1...n-1]`. The reversal doesn't affect this.\n*   If `l <= k <= r`: This is the tricky part. We take 1s from `a[0...l-1]`, then 1s from `a[l...k]` (which was `a[r...r-(k-l)]` in original `a`), then 2s from `a[k+1...r]` (which was `a[r-(k+1-l)...l]` in original `a`), then 2s from `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n\nLet's simplify.\nAn LNDS always consists of some 1s followed by some 2s.\nWe can define three regions:\n1.  Prefix: `a[0...l-1]`\n2.  Middle (reversed): `a[l...r]` (after reversal)\n3.  Suffix: `a[r+1...n-1]`\n\nThe LNDS will pick some 1s from the prefix, some 1s from the middle, some 2s from the middle, and some 2s from the suffix.\nThe total number of 1s in the sequence `b` is `total_ones`.\nThe total number of 2s in the sequence `b` is `total_twos`.\nThe maximum possible LNDS length is `total_ones + total_twos = n`. This occurs if `b` is `1,1,...,1,2,2,...,2`.\n\nLet `ones_before[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\nLet `twos_after[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\n\nFor each `l` from `0` to `n-1` and `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\nThe reversed segment is `a[l...r]`.\nWe want to find a split point `k` (0-indexed, meaning `b[0...k]` are 1s and `b[k+1...n-1]` are 2s).\nThe LNDS length for a given `k` is `(count of 1s in b[0...k]) + (count of 2s in b[k+1...n-1])`.\n\nLet's fix `l` and `r`.\n`count1_prefix = ones_before[l]` (1s in `a[0...l-1]`)\n`count2_suffix = twos_after[r+1]` (2s in `a[r+1...n-1]`)\n\nNow consider the segment `a[l...r]` (original values).\nWhen reversed, `a[l...r]` becomes `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`.\nLet `count1_middle_orig =` number of 1s in `a[l...r]`.\nLet `count2_middle_orig =` number of 2s in `a[l...r]`.\n\nThe LNDS will take `count1_prefix` 1s from before `l`.\nIt will take `count2_suffix` 2s from after `r`.\nFrom the middle segment, `a[l...r]` (reversed), we can take *all* its 1s and *all* its 2s.\nWhy? Because after reversal, all 1s in `a[l...r]` will appear before all 2s in `a[l...r]` if we pick them that way.\nFor example, if `a[l...r]` is `2 1 1 2 1`, after reversal it's `1 2 1 1 2`.\nWe can take `count1_prefix` 1s, then all 1s from the reversed segment (which are `1, 1, 1`), then all 2s from the reversed segment (which are `2, 2`), then `count2_suffix` 2s.\nThe total length would be `count1_prefix + count1_middle_orig + count2_middle_orig + count2_suffix`.\nThis is simply `ones_before[l] + (number of elements in a[l...r]) + twos_after[r+1]`.\nThis is equivalent to `ones_before[l] + (r - l + 1) + twos_after[r+1]`.\n\nThis formula works because the reversed segment `a[l...r]` (which becomes `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`) can *always* contribute all its 1s and all its 2s to an LNDS. We can pick all 1s from `a[0...l-1]`, then all 1s from the reversed segment, then all 2s from the reversed segment, then all 2s from `a[r+1...n-1]`. This forms a valid non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nSo, the maximum LNDS length for a chosen `[l, r]` is:\n`(count of 1s in a[0...l-1]) + (length of a[l...r]) + (count of 2s in a[r+1...n-1])`\nThis can be calculated as `prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1]`.\n\nPrecomputation:\n1.  `prefix_ones`: `prefix_ones[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`. `prefix_ones[0]=0`.\n2.  `suffix_twos`: `suffix_twos[i]` = count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`. `suffix_twos[n]=0`.\n\nBoth can be computed in `O(N)` time.\n\nThen, iterate `l` from `0` to `n-1`, `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\nFor each `(l, r)` pair, calculate `current_lnds = prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1]`.\nUpdate `max_lnds = max(max_lnds, current_lnds)`.\nThis takes `O(N^2)` time. `2000^2 = 4 * 10^6`, which is efficient enough.\n\n**Example 1:** `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, `n = 4`\n`prefix_ones = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\n`suffix_twos = [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]`\n\nInitialize `max_lnds = 0`.\n\nConsider `l=1, r=2` (0-indexed: `a[1...2]` is `[2, 1]`).\n`a` becomes `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.\n`current_lnds = prefix_ones[1] + (2 - 1 + 1) + suffix_twos[2+1]`\n`= prefix_ones[1] + 2 + suffix_twos[3]`\n`= 1 + 2 + 1 = 4`.\n`max_lnds = 4`.\n\nAfter checking all `N^2` pairs, the maximum will be found.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   `n=1`: `a = [1]` or `a = [2]`.\n    *   `l=0, r=0`: `prefix_ones[0] + (0-0+1) + suffix_twos[1]`\n        *   If `a = [1]`: `0 + 1 + 0 = 1`.\n        *   If `a = [2]`: `0 + 1 + 0 = 1`.\n    Correct, LNDS is 1.\n*   No reversal (`l, r` not chosen): The problem states \"choose an interval [l, r]\". If we choose `l=0, r=0`, it's a valid reversal. The current logic covers this. The maximum LNDS without any reversal is simply `max(prefix_ones[k] + suffix_twos[k] for k in 0...n)`. Our approach effectively includes this by checking all single-element reversals. For example, if `a = [1, 1, 2, 2]`, `l=0, r=0` gives `prefix_ones[0] + 1 + suffix_twos[1] = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3`. This is not 4.\n    The formula `prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1]` works for a *specific* split point that effectively takes all elements from `a[l...r]`. However, the LNDS could still be formed by taking some 1s from `a[0...l-1]`, *some* 1s from the reversed `a[l...r]`, *some* 2s from the reversed `a[l...r]`, and *some* 2s from `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the LNDS calculation for `b`.\nThe LNDS length for any sequence `b` is `max(prefix_ones_b[k] + suffix_twos_b[k+1])` for `k` from `-1` to `n-1`.\n`prefix_ones_b[k]` is count of 1s in `b[0...k-1]`.\n`suffix_twos_b[k+1]` is count of 2s in `b[k+1...n-1]`.\n\nFor each `l, r`:\n1.  Construct `b`: `b = a[0...l-1] + a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l] + a[r+1...n-1]`.\n2.  Calculate `prefix_ones_b` and `suffix_twos_b` for `b`.\n3.  Calculate `max_val = max(prefix_ones_b[k] + suffix_twos_b[k+1] for k in range(-1, n))`.\n4.  Update global `max_lnds`.\n\nThis is `O(N^2 * (N + N)) = O(N^3)`. `2000^3 = 8 * 10^9`, still too slow.\n\nLet's stick to the `O(N^2)` logic:\n`max_lnds` is initialized to the LNDS of the original array `a`.\nThen iterate `l, r`:\nFor each `l, r`:\n  `b = a[:l] + a[l:r+1][::-1] + a[r+1:]`\n  `current_lnds = calculate_lnds(b)`\n  `max_lnds = max(max_lnds, current_lnds)`\n\nHow to calculate `calculate_lnds(b)` efficiently?\n`b` is a sequence of 1s and 2s.\n`calculate_lnds(b)`:\n  `max_len = 0`\n  `ones_count = 0`\n  `twos_total = b.count(2)`\n  `current_twos = twos_total`\n  For `i` from `0` to `n-1`:\n    `max_len = max(max_len, ones_count + current_twos)` (split point before `b[i]`)\n    If `b[i] == 1`: `ones_count += 1`\n    Else (`b[i] == 2`): `current_twos -= 1`\n  `max_len = max(max_len, ones_count + current_twos)` (split point after `b[n-1]`)\n  Return `max_len`.\nThis `calculate_lnds` is `O(N)`.\n\nSo, the `O(N^3)` approach is:\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    def calculate_lnds(arr):\n        max_len = 0\n        ones_count = 0\n        twos_total = arr.count(2)\n        current_twos = twos_total\n\n        # Case: all 2s (split point before first element)\n        max_len = max(max_len, current_twos)\n\n        for x in arr:\n            if x == 1:\n                ones_count += 1\n            else: # x == 2\n                current_twos -= 1\n            max_len = max(max_len, ones_count + current_twos)\n        \n        # Case: all 1s (split point after last element)\n        max_len = max(max_len, ones_count) # current_twos would be 0 here\n        \n        return max_len\n\n    max_overall_lnds = 0\n\n    # Initial LNDS without any reversal\n    max_overall_lnds = calculate_lnds(a)\n\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Create the modified array\n            b = a[:l] + a[l:r+1][::-1] + a[r+1:]\n            \n            # Calculate LNDS for the modified array\n            current_lnds = calculate_lnds(b)\n            max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, current_lnds)\n            \n    print(max_overall_lnds)\n\nsolve()\n```\nLet's double check the `calculate_lnds` function logic.\n`arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]`\n`n=10`\n`twos_total = 5`\n\n`max_len = 0`\n`ones_count = 0`\n`current_twos = 5`\n\n1. `max_len = max(0, 5) = 5` (split before index 0, take all 2s)\n2. `x = 1`: `ones_count = 1`, `current_twos = 5`. `max_len = max(5, 1+5) = 6`\n3. `x = 1`: `ones_count = 2`, `current_twos = 5`. `max_len = max(6, 2+5) = 7`\n4. `x = 2`: `ones_count = 2`, `current_twos = 4`. `max_len = max(7, 2+4) = 7`\n5. `x = 2`: `ones_count = 2`, `current_twos = 3`. `max_len = max(7, 2+3) = 7`\n6. `x = 2`: `ones_count = 2`, `current_twos = 2`. `max_len = max(7, 2+2) = 7`\n7. `x = 1`: `ones_count = 3`, `current_twos = 2`. `max_len = max(7, 3+2) = 7`\n8. `x = 1`: `ones_count = 4`, `current_twos = 2`. `max_len = max(7, 4+2) = 7`\n9. `x = 2`: `ones_count = 4`, `current_twos = 1`. `max_len = max(7, 4+1) = 7`\n10. `x = 2`: `ones_count = 4`, `current_twos = 0`. `max_len = max(7, 4+0) = 7`\n11. `x = 1`: `ones_count = 5`, `current_twos = 0`. `max_len = max(7, 5+0) = 7`\n\nEnd loop.\n`max_len = max(7, 5) = 7` (split after index 9, take all 1s).\nThis gives 7.\n\nLet's manually verify for `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]`:\nSplit points (index `k` means `b[0...k]` are 1s, `b[k+1...n-1]` are 2s):\n`k = -1`: 0 ones, 5 twos -> len 5\n`k = 0`: `b[0]=1`. 1 one, 5 twos -> len 6\n`k = 1`: `b[0,1]=1,1`. 2 ones, 5 twos -> len 7\n`k = 2`: `b[0,1,2]=1,1,2`. 2 ones, 4 twos -> len 6\n`k = 3`: `b[0,1,2,3]=1,1,2,2`. 2 ones, 3 twos -> len 5\n`k = 4`: `b[0,1,2,3,4]=1,1,2,2,2`. 2 ones, 2 twos -> len 4\n`k = 5`: `b[0...5]=1,1,2,2,2,1`. 3 ones, 2 twos -> len 5\n`k = 6`: `b[0...6]=1,1,2,2,2,1,1`. 4 ones, 2 twos -> len 6\n`k = 7`: `b[0...7]=1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2`. 4 ones, 1 two -> len 5\n`k = 8`: `b[0...8]=1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2`. 4 ones, 0 twos -> len 4\n`k = 9`: `b[0...9]=1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1`. 5 ones, 0 twos -> len 5\n\nMy `calculate_lnds` function is wrong.\nThe split point is *between* elements or at the ends.\nA split point `k` means we take 1s up to index `k` and 2s from index `k+1`.\n`ones_count` is 1s from `arr[0...i-1]`.\n`current_twos` is 2s from `arr[i...n-1]`.\nSo, `ones_count + current_twos` is the length of LNDS if the split point is *before* index `i`.\n\nCorrected `calculate_lnds`:\n```python\n    def calculate_lnds(arr):\n        n_arr = len(arr)\n        max_len = 0\n        \n        # Precompute prefix_ones and suffix_twos for arr\n        prefix_ones = [0] * (n_arr + 1)\n        for i in range(n_arr):\n            prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if arr[i] == 1 else 0)\n        \n        suffix_twos = [0] * (n_arr + 1)\n        for i in range(n_arr -

Output `9`.\nIf `[3, 7]` is reversed (0-indexed `a[2...6]` is `[2, 2, 2, 1, 1]`):\nOriginal: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]`\nReversed `a[2...6]`: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`\nNew sequence `b`: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]`\nLet's apply `calculate_lnds` to `b`:\n`prefix_ones = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5]`\n`suffix_twos = [5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0]`\n\nSplit point `k`: `prefix_ones[k] + suffix_twos[k]`\n`k=0`: `0 + 5 = 5`\n`k=1`: `1 + 5 = 6`\n`k=2`: `2 + 5 = 7`\n`k=3`: `3 + 5 = 8`\n`k=4`: `4 + 4 = 8`\n`k=5`: `4 + 3 = 7`\n`k=6`: `4 + 2 = 6`\n`k=7`: `4 + 2 = 6`\n`k=8`: `4 + 1 = 5`\n`k=9`: `4 + 1 = 5`\n`k=10`: `5 + 0 = 5`\nMax is 8.\nThe example output is 9. My logic is still missing something.\n\nAh, the example output description states for the second example:\n\"after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\"\nMy calculation for that sequence was 8.\nLet's check `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]` for LNDS.\n`1_at_0, 1_at_1, 1_at_2, 1_at_3, 2_at_4, 2_at_5, 2_at_6, 2_at_7, 2_at_8`.\nThis is 4 ones and 5 twos. Total 9.\nThis subsequence is `b[0], b[1], b[2], b[3], b[4], b[5], b[6], b[7], b[8]`.\nThe element `b[9]` which is `1` is not included.\nMy `prefix_ones[k] + suffix_twos[k]` formula correctly calculates this.\n`k=4`: `prefix_ones[4]` is count of 1s in `b[0...3]`, which is 4. `suffix_twos[4]` is count of 2s in `b[4...9]`, which is 5. Sum is 9.\n\nMy `calculate_lnds` function is correct. The issue is with the `O(N^3)` complexity.\nThe `O(N^2)` solution must be possible by avoiding recalculating `prefix_ones` and `suffix_twos` from scratch for each `b`.\n\nLet `P1[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]` (original array).\nLet `S2[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]` (original array).\n\nFor a chosen `l, r`:\nThe sequence `b` is `a[0...l-1] + a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l] + a[r+1...n-1]`.\nWe need to find `max_k ( (count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1]) )`.\n\nLet's fix `l`. Now vary `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\nWhen `r` increases by 1, `a[r+1]` is added to the reversed segment.\nThis isn't simple.\n\nThe `O(N^2)` approach must be based on iterating `l` and `r` and calculating the LNDS in `O(1)` or `O(N)` but with shared precomputation.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the LNDS. It can be split into three parts:\n1.  1s from `a[0...l-1]`\n2.  1s and 2s from the reversed segment `a[l...r]`\n3.  2s from `a[r+1...n-1]`\n\nSuppose the split point `k` for the overall LNDS is:\nCase 1: `k < l`. The split is entirely in the prefix `a[0...l-1]`.\n    LNDS length = `P1[k] + S2[k]`. This is independent of `l, r`. We can calculate `max(P1[k] + S2[k])` for `k < l` once.\nCase 2: `k > r`. The split is entirely in the suffix `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n    LNDS length = `P1[k] + S2[k]`. This is also independent of `l, r`.\nCase 3: `l <= k <= r`. The split is inside the reversed segment `a[l...r]`.\n    LNDS length = `(1s in a[0...l-1]) + (1s in reversed a[l...k-1]) + (2s in reversed a[k...r]) + (2s in a[r+1...n-1])`.\n    This is `P1[l] + (1s in reversed a[l...k-1]) + (2s in reversed a[k...r]) + S2[r+1]`.\n\nLet `ones_in_reversed_middle(l, r, split_idx_in_middle)` and `twos_in_reversed_middle(l, r, split_idx_in_middle)` be the counts.\nThe original segment `a[l...r]` is `a_l, ..., a_r`.\nThe reversed segment is `a_r, ..., a_l`.\nIf the split point in the reversed segment is `j` (0-indexed within the reversed segment), then we take 1s from `a_r, ..., a_{r-j}` and 2s from `a_{r-j-1}, ..., a_l`.\n\nThis is equivalent to: we pick 1s from `a[0...l-1]`, then some 1s from `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`, then some 2s from `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`, then some 2s from `a[r+1...n-1]`.\nLet `c1(i, j)` be count of 1s in `a[i...j]`.\nLet `c2(i, j)` be count of 2s in `a[i...j]`.\nFor a fixed `l, r`, we are looking for `max_{p \\in [l, r]} (P1[l] + c1(p+1, r) + c2(l, p) + S2[r+1])`.\nHere, `p` is the index in the *original* array `a` such that `a[p]` is the last element taken as a 1 from the reversed segment, and `a[p+1]` is the first element taken as a 2 from the reversed segment.\nThis means elements `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[p+1]` (all 1s) and `a[p], a[p-1], ..., a[l]` (all 2s).\nThe count of 1s from the reversed segment is `c1(p+1, r)`.\nThe count of 2s from the reversed segment is `c2(l, p)`.\nSo, for each `l, r`, we need to find `max_{p=l-1}^{r} (P1[l] + c1(p+1, r) + c2(l, p) + S2[r+1])`.\nLet `p=-1` means no 1s from reversed segment, all 2s.\nLet `p=r` means all 1s from reversed segment, no 2s.\n\n`P1[l]` and `S2[r+1]` are fixed for a given `l, r`.\nWe need to maximize `c1(p+1, r) + c2(l, p)` for `p` from `l-1` to `r`.\n`c1(p+1, r)` can be computed using suffix sums of 1s within `a[l...r]`.\n`c2(l, p)` can be computed using prefix sums of 2s within `a[l...r]`.\nLet `ones_suffix_in_middle[i]` be count of 1s in `a[i...r]`.\nLet `twos_prefix_in_middle[i]` be count of 2s in `a[l...i]`.\nFor each `l, r`, iterating `p` from `l-1` to `r` takes `O(r-l+1)` time.\n`ones_suffix_in_middle` and `twos_prefix_in_middle` can be precomputed for `a[l...r]` in `O(r-l+1)`.\nSo, for each `l, r`, calculating the max over `p` takes `O(r-l+1)`.\nTotal time: `sum_{l=0}^{n-1} sum_{r=l}^{n-1} (r-l+1)`.\nThis is `O(N^3)`.\n`sum_{len=1}^{N} sum_{l=0}^{N-len} len = sum_{len=1}^{N} (N-len+1) * len = O(N^3)`.\n\nThis means the `O(N^3)` solution is what is expected for \"easy question\" with `N=2000`? This is unusual. `N=2000` usually means `O(N^2)` or `O(N log N)`.\nMaybe `N=2000` for `O(N^3)` in Python is acceptable if the constant factor is very small.\nThe `calculate_lnds` function in my `O(N^3)` approach uses list slicing and `list.count()`. `list.count()` is `O(N)`. Slicing is `O(N)`. So constructing `b` is `O(N)`.\n`calculate_lnds` itself is `O(N)` due to `prefix_ones` and `suffix_twos` computation.\nSo `O(N^2 * (N + N)) = O(N^3)`.\n\nLet's check the constraints again. `n <= 2000`.\nA typical competitive programming problem with `N=2000` expects `O(N^2)` or `O(N log N)`. `N^3` is usually for `N <= 500`.\n`2000^3 = 8 * 10^9` is too much for a 1-2 second time limit.\n`2000^2 = 4 * 10^6` is perfectly fine.\n\nThere must be an `O(N^2)` way to calculate the LNDS for `b` without explicit construction or `O(N)` loop for `k`.\n\nLet's fix `l`. Iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\nWhen `r` increases to `r+1`:\nThe element `a[r+1]` is added to the suffix part `a[r+1...n-1]`.\nThe element `a[r+1]` is also added to the reversed segment `a[l...r+1]`.\nThis is still making it complicated.\n\nLet's consider the maximum LNDS as `P1[i] + S2[j]` where `i <= j`.\nThis represents taking all 1s up to index `i-1` and all 2s from index `j` onwards.\nThe elements `a[i...j-1]` are \"ignored\".\nWhen we reverse `a[l...r]`, the elements `a[0...l-1]` and `a[r+1...n-1]` are fixed.\nThe elements `a[l...r]` are \"rearranged\".\nAn LNDS can be formed by:\n`P1[i]` (1s from `a[0...i-1]`) + `S2[j]` (2s from `a[j...n-1]`)\nwhere `i` is the split point.\nThis is the LNDS for the original array `a`.\n\nWhat if the LNDS uses elements from the reversed segment?\nIt will be `(some 1s from a[0...l-1]) + (some 1s from reversed a[l...r]) + (some 2s from reversed a[l...r]) + (some 2s from a[r+1...n-1])`.\nLet `i` be the index *before* which all 1s are taken, and `j` be the index *after* which all 2s are taken.\nSo we take 1s from `b[0...i-1]` and 2s from `b[j...n-1]`.\nIf `i <= l`: `P1[i]` 1s are taken.\nIf `j > r`: `S2[j]` 2s are taken.\n\nConsider the general case:\nThe LNDS for `b` is `max_k (ones_count_in_b_prefix_k + twos_count_in_b_suffix_k)`.\nLet `l_idx` be the index of the element `a[l]` in `b`.\nLet `r_idx` be the index of the element `a[r]` in `b`.\n`l_idx = l`, `r_idx = r`.\nThe segment `b[l...r]` is `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`.\n\nLet's fix the split point `k` in the *modified* array `b`.\nCase 1: `k <= l` (split point is before or at `l`).\n    The LNDS takes `P1[k]` ones from `a[0...k-1]`.\n    The LNDS takes `S2_b[k]` twos from `b[k...n-1]`.\n    `S2_b[k]` consists of `c2(a[l...r] reversed from k)` + `S2[r+1]`.\n    This is `S2[l] - c2(a[k...l-1]) + c2(a[l...r] reversed from l) + S2[r+1]`\n    This is becoming too complex.\n\nThe `O(N^3)` solution is likely what's intended if the problem is indeed \"easy\" and `N=2000` is a bit of a misdirection or a loose upper bound. Or the test cases are weak.\nLet's try to estimate the actual operations.\n`N=2000`. `N^3 = 8 * 10^9`. This is too large.\n`N^2` is `4 * 10^6`.\n`N^2 * (N_slice + N_count)`\n`b = a[:l] + a[l:r+1][::-1] + a[r+1:]`\n`a[:l]` and `a[r+1:]` are `O(N)`. `a[l:r+1][::-1]` is `O(r-l+1)`. Total `O(N)`.\n`calculate_lnds`: `prefix_ones` and `suffix_twos` are `O(N)`. Loop is `O(N)`. Total `O(N)`.\nSo, `O(N^2 * N) = O(N^3)`.\n\nPerhaps the problem implies that `a_i` are only 1 and 2, which makes LNDS calculation simpler than general LNDS, but the `O(N)` calculation is already the simplest.\n\nWhat if we fix the middle segment `a[l...r]` and the split point `p` within it?\nThe LNDS would be `P1[l] + c1(p+1, r) + c2(l, p) + S2[r+1]`.\nWe need to maximize this over `l, r, p`.\n`P1[l]` is `count of 1s in a[0...l-1]`.\n`S2[r+1]` is `count of 2s in a[r+1...n-1]`.\n`c1(p+1, r)` is `count of 1s in a[p+1...r]`.\n`c2(l, p)` is `count of 2s in a[l...p]`.\n\nLet `P1_original[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\nLet `S2_original[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\nLet `P2_original[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`.\nLet `S1_original[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[i...n-1]`.\n\nThen `c1(p+1, r) = S1_original[p+1] - S1_original[r+1]`.\nAnd `c2(l, p) = P2_original[p+1] - P2_original[l]`.\n\nThe expression to maximize is `P1_original[l] + (S1_original[p+1] - S1_original[r+1]) + (P2_original[p+1] - P2_original[l]) + S2_original[r+1]`.\nThis is `P1_original[l] - P2_original[l] + S2_original[r+1] - S1_original[r+1] + S1_original[p+1] + P2_original[p+1]`.\nLet `X_l = P1_original[l] - P2_original[l]`.\nLet `Y_r = S2_original[r+1] - S1_original[r+1]`.\nLet `Z_p = S1_original[p+1] + P2_original[p+1]`.\nWe need to maximize `X_l + Z_p + Y_r` where `0 <= l <= p <= r < n`.\n\nThis is a 3-nested loop problem: `l`, `r`, `p`.\n`l` from `0` to `n-1`.\n`r` from `l` to `n-1`.\n`p` from `l` to `r`.\nThis is still `O(N^3)`.\n\nThe only way this could be `O(N^2)` is if we can compute `max_{p=l}^{r} Z_p` in `O(1)` for fixed `l, r` when `r` is incremented.\n`max_{p=l}^{r} Z_p` is `max(Z_l, Z_{l+1}, ..., Z_r)`.\nWhen `r` increments to `r+1`, we need `max(Z_l, ..., Z_r, Z_{r+1})`. This is `max(max_{p=l}^{r} Z_p, Z_{r+1})`. This can be updated in `O(1)`.\nSo, for fixed `l`:\n  `max_Z_p = 0`\n  `for r from l to n-1`:\n    `max_Z_p = max(max_Z_p, Z_r)`\n    `current_lnds = X_l + max_Z_p + Y_r`\n    `max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, current_lnds)`\n\nThis is `O(N^2)`. This is the correct approach!\n\nLet's define `P1`, `P2`, `S1`, `S2` carefully (0-indexed `a`):\n`P1[i]`: count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`. `P1[0]=0`.\n`P2[i]`: count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`. `P2[0]=0`.\n`S1[i]`: count of 1s in `a[i...n-1]`. `S1[n]=0`.\n`S2[i]`: count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`. `S2[n]=0`.\n\nThese can be precomputed in `O(N)`:\n`P1[i+1] = P1[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)`\n`P2[i+1] = P2[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)`\n`S1[i] = S1[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)`\n`S2[i] = S2[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)`\n\nThe LNDS length for a chosen `l, r` and split point `p` (where `a[p]` is the last 1 in the middle segment, `a[p+1]` is first 2 in the middle segment) is:\n`P1[l]` (1s before `l`)\n`+ (S1[p+1] - S1[r+1])` (1s in `a[p+1...r]`)\n`+ (P2[p+1] - P2[l])` (2s in `a[l...p]`)\n`+ S2[r+1]` (2s after `r`)\n\nThis formula needs `l <= p < r`.\nWhat if `p < l`?

So we update `max_B_p_in_middle` with `B_r`.\n        `max_B_p_in_middle = max(max_B_p_in_middle, S1[r+1] + P2[r+1])`\n        \n        `current_lnds = (P1[l] - P2[l]) + max_B_p_in_middle + (S2[r+1] - S1[r+1])`\n        `max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, current_lnds)`\n\nThis looks correct and is `O(N^2)`.\nThe `S1[p+1] + P2[p+1]` term covers the case where the split point `p` is within `[l, r]`.\nWhat about cases where the split point is outside `[l, r]`?\nFor example, if the split point `k` is before `l` (`k < l`).\nThen the LNDS is `P1[k] + S2_b[k]`.\n`S2_b[k]` means `S2_b[l]` (twos in reversed `a[l...r]`) + `S2[r+1]` (twos after `r`).\n`S2_b[l]` is `P2[r+1] - P2[l]`.\nSo `P1[k] + (P2[r+1] - P2[l]) + S2[r+1]`.\nThis is `P1[k] + (P2[r+1] + S2[r+1]) - P2[l]`.\nThis is `P1[k] + (total 2s in a[l...n-1] if a[l...r] is reversed and everything else is normal)`.\nThis is `P1[k] + (P2[r+1] - P2[l] + S2[r+1])`.\nThis is `P1[k] - P2[l] + P2[r+1] + S2[r+1]`.\n\nWe need to consider all possible split points for the LNDS in the modified array `b`.\nA split point `k` means we take `P1_b[k]` ones and `S2_b[k]` twos.\n`P1_b[k]` is count of 1s in `b[0...k-1]`.\n`S2_b[k]` is count of 2s in `b[k...n-1]`.\n\nLet's compute `P1_b[k]` and `S2_b[k]` for a given `l, r`:\n`P1_b[k]`:\n*   If `k <= l`: `P1[k]`\n*   If `l < k <= r`: `P1[l] + (S1[r-(k-l-1)] - S1[r+1])` (1s before `l` + 1s in `a[r], ..., a[r-(k-l-1)]`)\n*   If `k > r`: `P1[l] + (S1[l] - S1[r+1]) + (P1[k] - P1[r+1])` (1s before `l` + 1s in reversed `a[l...r]` + 1s after `r`)\n\n`S2_b[k]`:\n*   If `k <= l`: `S2[l] + (P2[r+1] - P2[l])` (2s in `a[l...r]` reversed + 2s after `r`)\n*   If `l < k <= r`: `(P2[r-(k-l)+1] - P2[l]) + S2[r+1]` (2s in `a[r-(k-l)], ..., a[l]` + 2s after `r`)\n*   If `k > r`: `S2[k]`\n\nThis is again complex and `O(N)` for each `l, r` pair, leading to `O(N^3)`.\n\nThe `A_l + B_p + C_r` formula is for the case where the split point is *inside* the reversed segment `[l, r]`.\nThe overall `max_lnds` must also consider split points *outside* the reversed segment.\n`max_overall_lnds` should be initialized to `max(P1[k] + S2[k])` for all `k`. This covers no reversal.\n\nFor `l, r`:\n1. Split point `k < l`: LNDS is `P1[k] + (P2[r+1] - P2[l]) + S2[r+1]`.\n   We need `max_{k<l} (P1[k] - P2[l] + P2[r+1] + S2[r+1])`.\n   `P2[r+1] + S2[r+1]` is fixed for `r`. `P2[l]` is fixed for `l`.\n   We need `max_{k<l} P1[k]`. This is `P1[l]`.\n   So, `P1[l] - P2[l] + P2[r+1] + S2[r+1]`.\n\n2. Split point `k > r`: LNDS is `P1[l] + (S1[l] - S1[r+1]) + S2[k]`.\n   We need `max_{k>r} (P1[l] + S1[l] - S1[r+1] + S2[k])`.\n   `P1[l] + S1[l]` is fixed for `l`. `S1[r+1]` is fixed for `r`.\n   We need `max_{k>r} S2[k]`. This is `S2[r+1]`.\n   So, `P1[l] + S1[l] - S1[r+1] + S2[r+1]`.\n\n3. Split point `l <= k <= r`: This is the `A_l + B_p + C_r` case.\n   `P1[l] - P2[l] + (S1[p+1] + P2[p+1]) + S2[r+1] - S1[r+1]`.\n\nSo for each `l, r` pair, we compute three candidates for `current_lnds`:\n`cand1 = P1[l] - P2[l] + P2[r+1] + S2[r+1]`\n`cand2 = P1[l] + S1[l] - S1[r+1] + S2[r+1]`\n`cand3 = (P1[l] - P2[l]) + max_{p=l}^{r}(S1[p+1] + P2[p+1]) + (S2[r+1] - S1[r+1])`\n\nThe `max_{p=l}^{r}(S1[p+1] + P2[p+1])` part is what `max_B_p_in_middle` tracks.\nThis seems to cover all cases and is `O(N^2)`.\n\nFinal check of index ranges:\n`P1, P2` are size `n+1`, `P1[i]` is count in `a[0...i-1]`.\n`S1, S2` are size `n+1`, `S1[i]` is count in `a[i...n-1]`.\n\n`cand1 = P1[l] - P2[l] + P2[r+1] + S2[r+1]`\n`l` from `0` to `n`. `r+1` from `1` to `n+1`.\n`P1[l]` for `l=0` to `n`. `P2[l]` for `l=0` to `n`.\n`P2[r+1]` for `r+1=0` to `n`. `S2[r+1]` for `r+1=0` to `n`.\nIndices are fine.\n\n`cand2 = P1[l] + S1[l] - S1[r+1] + S2[r+1]`\nIndices are fine.\n\n`B_p = S1[p+1] + P2[p+1]`.\n`p` ranges from `l` to `r`.\nSo `p+1` ranges from `l+1` to `r+1`.\n`S1[idx]` for `idx` from `0` to `n`. `P2[idx]` for `idx` from `0` to `n`.\nIndices are fine.\n\nThis `O(N^2)` solution seems robust.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Precompute prefix sums for 1s and 2s\n    # P1[i]: count of 1s in a[0...i-1]\n    # P2[i]: count of 2s in a[0...i-1]\n    P1 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    P2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        P1[i+1] = P1[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n        P2[i+1] = P2[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n\n    # Precompute suffix sums for 1s and 2s\n    # S1[i]: count of 1s in a[i...n-1]\n    # S2[i]: count of 2s in a[i...n-1]\n    S1 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    S2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        S1[i] = S1[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n        S2[i] = S2[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n\n    max_overall_lnds = 0\n\n    # Case 0: No reversal, or reversal of a single element (which doesn't change anything)\n    # The LNDS for the original array\n    for k in range(n + 1): # k is the split point: 1s from a[0...k-1], 2s from a[k...n-1]\n        max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, P1[k] + S2[k])\n\n    # Iterate over all possible reversal intervals [l, r]\n    # l and r are 0-indexed\n    for l in range(n):\n        max_B_p_in_middle = 0 # Max of (S1[p+1] + P2[p+1]) for p in [l, current_r]\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Calculate LNDS for current [l, r] reversal\n\n            # Term for split point 'p' within [l, r] (inclusive)\n            # The value B_p = S1[p+1] + P2[p+1]\n            # As r increases, p can now also be r.
