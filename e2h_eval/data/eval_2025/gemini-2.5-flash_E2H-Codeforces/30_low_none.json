Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Initial Assessment: Tackling the TV Game Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm diving into this \"TV Game\" problem. My understanding is that we've got two players, Homer and Marge, battling it out.  We're given a number 'A' with an even number of digits (2n, to be precise). Each player gets to make 'n' moves, selecting digits from the *left* of 'A' and building their own numbers, S1 (Homer) and S2 (Marge). The goal is crystal clear: maximize the *sum* of S1 and S2.  The output needs to be a string of 'H' and 'M' characters, indicating the move order.\n\nThe constraints are pretty reasonable: 'n' can go up to 18, so we're looking at potentially handling some large numbers, but still manageable.  No real surprises there.\n\nLooking at the examples, the logic seems to be: experiment with digit combinations to find the allocation of digits between H and M, so that their sum is maximized. The position of each character taken from the source number is important.\n\nThe examples really solidified it for me. I can immediately see that, since we're *adding* the numbers, the goal should be to create numbers closer in magnitude.\nIn the first example, the high-value digit and the low-value digit need to be separated. And that could be accomplished by separating the large values and the small values into different groups.\n\nThe key realization here is that the *order* within each player's number is fixed by the order of digits in the original number 'A'. So, it's not about rearranging digits, it's about *allocating* them. The fact that maximizing S1 + S2 is the objective tells me I need to think carefully about how to distribute the digits between the players. It seems like the best approach is to start from the most significant digits, to get the larger groups. Given the possible ranges of n, I suspect I can use a brute-force approach to try and choose the best allocations.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to choose `n` digits for Homer's number `S1` and `n` digits for Marge's number `S2` from a given `2n`-digit number `A`. The digits are taken from left to right. Our goal is to maximize the sum `S1 + S2`.\n\nLet's denote the digits of `A` as `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{2n-1}`.\nWhen a player takes a digit `a_i`, it is appended to their current number. `S1` and `S2` are formed by concatenating digits. For example, if `S1` gets digits `a_i, a_j, a_k` in that order, `S1` becomes `a_i a_j a_k`.\nThe value of a number formed by digits `d_0 d_1 ... d_{k-1}` is `d_0 * 10^(k-1) + d_1 * 10^(k-2) + ... + d_{k-1} * 10^0`.\n\nSince `n` can be up to 18, `2n` can be up to 36. A brute-force approach trying all `(2n choose n)` combinations of moves would be too slow (`(36 choose 18)` is a very large number). This suggests a dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet `dp[i][h_count][m_count]` be the maximum possible sum of `S1` and `S2` considering the first `i` digits of `A`, where Homer has taken `h_count` digits and Marge has taken `m_count` digits.\nThe state would also need to store the actual numbers `S1` and `S2` to calculate their sum, which would make the state space too large (numbers can be very big).\n\nA key observation is that `S1 + S2` is maximized.\nLet `S1 = d_{1,0} d_{1,1} ... d_{1,n-1}` and `S2 = d_{2,0} d_{2,1} ... d_{2,n-1}`.\nThe value of `S1` is `sum_{j=0}^{n-1} d_{1,j} * 10^(n-1-j)`.\nThe value of `S2` is `sum_{j=0}^{n-1} d_{2,j} * 10^(n-1-j)`.\nWe need to maximize `sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (d_{1,j} + d_{2,j}) * 10^(n-1-j)`.\n\nConsider the digits `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{2n-1}`.\nFor each position `k` from `0` to `2n-1`, the digit `a_k` will be assigned to either Homer or Marge.\nIf `a_k` is the `j`-th digit Homer takes (0-indexed), it contributes `a_k * 10^(n-1-j)` to `S1`.\nIf `a_k` is the `j`-th digit Marge takes, it contributes `a_k * 10^(n-1-j)` to `S2`.\n\nLet `dp[h_taken][m_taken]` be a pair `(max_sum, path_string)` where `max_sum` is the maximum total prize `S1 + S2` achieved when Homer has taken `h_taken` digits and Marge has taken `m_taken` digits, and `path_string` is the sequence of moves that leads to this `max_sum`.\n\nThe state `(h_taken, m_taken)` uniquely determines how many digits have been processed so far: `i = h_taken + m_taken`.\nThe base case is `dp[0][0] = (0, \"\")`.\nWe iterate `i` from `0` to `2n-1` (representing the current digit `A[i]` being processed).\nFor each state `(h_taken, m_taken)` such that `h_taken + m_taken = i`:\n1. If `h_taken < n`: Homer can take the current digit `A[i]`.\n   The digit `A[i]` will be the `h_taken`-th digit for Homer. Its contribution to `S1` is `int(A[i]) * 10^(n-1-h_taken)`.\n   The new `max_sum` would be `dp[h_taken][m_taken].max_sum + int(A[i]) * 10^(n-1-h_taken)`.\n   We update `dp[h_taken+1][m_taken]` if this new sum is greater.\n2. If `m_taken < n`: Marge can take the current digit `A[i]`.\n   The digit `A[i]` will be the `m_taken`-th digit for Marge. Its contribution to `S2` is `int(A[i]) * 10^(n-1-m_taken)`.\n   The new `max_sum` would be `dp[h_taken][m_taken].max_sum + int(A[i]) * 10^(n-1-m_taken)`.\n   We update `dp[h_taken][m_taken+1]` if this new sum is greater.\n\nThe `max_sum` can be very large (`18 * 9 * 10^17` roughly), so Python's arbitrary precision integers are necessary.\nThe number of states `(h_taken, m_taken)` is `(n+1) * (n+1)`. For `n=18`, this is `19 * 19 = 361` states.\nEach state transition involves constant time operations.\nTotal time complexity: `O(n^2 * 2n)` or `O(n^3)` if we consider `i` explicitly, or `O(n^2)` if we iterate over `h_taken` and `m_taken` directly.\nThe number of operations is roughly `(n+1)^2 * 2`, which is very efficient.\n\nLet's refine the DP state and transitions:\n`dp[h][m]` stores `(max_score, path_string)` for `h` digits taken by Homer and `m` digits taken by Marge.\nInitialize `dp` table with `(-1, \"\")` indicating unvisited states.\n`dp[0][0] = (0, \"\")`\n\nIterate `h` from `0` to `n`:\n  Iterate `m` from `0` to `n`:\n    If `dp[h][m].max_score == -1`, continue (this state is unreachable).\n    Let `current_score = dp[h][m].max_score` and `current_path = dp[h][m].path_string`.\n    `current_digit_index = h + m`.\n    If `current_digit_index >= 2n`, continue (all digits processed).\n\n    `digit_val = int(A[current_digit_index])`\n\n    // Option 1: Homer takes the digit\n    If `h < n`:\n      `homer_contribution = digit_val * (10**(n - 1 - h))`\n      `new_score = current_score + homer_contribution`\n      `new_path = current_path + 'H'`\n      If `new_score > dp[h+1][m].max_score`:\n        `dp[h+1][m] = (new_score, new_path)`\n\n    // Option 2: Marge takes the digit\n    If `m < n`:\n      `marge_contribution = digit_val * (10**(n - 1 - m))`\n      `new_score = current_score + marge_contribution`\n      `new_path = current_path + 'M'`\n      If `new_score > dp[h][m+1].max_score`:\n        `dp[h][m+1] = (new_score, new_path)`\n\nAfter filling the `dp` table, the result is `dp[n][n].path_string`.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `n=2`, `A=\"1234\"`\n`dp` table size `(3x3)`. `n-1 = 1`.\n`dp[0][0] = (0, \"\")`\n\n`h=0, m=0`: `current_digit_index = 0`. `A[0] = '1'`.\n  Homer takes: `h_contrib = 1 * (10**(1-0)) = 10`.\n    `new_score = 0 + 10 = 10`. `new_path = \"H\"`.\n    `dp[1][0] = (10, \"H\")`\n  Marge takes: `m_contrib = 1 * (10**(1-0)) = 10`.\n    `new_score = 0 + 10 = 10`. `new_path = \"M\"`.\n    `dp[0][1] = (10, \"M\")`\n\n`h=0, m=1`: `current_digit_index = 1`. `A[1] = '2'`.
