Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Colored Boots\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got this \"Colored Boots\" problem. The user wants me to find the maximum compatible pairs of left and right boots, given their colors. It sounds like a matching problem, specifically a bipartite matching scenario. The goal is to maximize the number of pairs while adhering to specific compatibility rules: identical colors or at least one wildcard ('?') color. And the efficiency is important as N can go up to 150,000, so I need to be smart about this.\n\nMy initial thought is that a greedy approach seems like the way to go. Standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms would probably be too slow, given the constraints. Let's see, the compatibility rules give me a hint on how to prioritize matches. Matches of identical, specific colors are the most restrictive because they must pair with their exact match. Pairs with a '?' are less restrictive as they provide more options. And a pair with two '?' characters are the least restrictive because any pair would work.\n\nThe strategy seems to be: prioritize the most restrictive matches first, because if I use a restrictive boot in a more flexible match, I might block a better match later.\n\nSo, I'll need to organize the boots by color, so I can easily identify matches. I'll create `left_boots` and `right_boots` data structures that will store lists of indices for each color. This will be a dictionary of lists, or a simple array of lists would work just as well, with each list associated with a particular color. It'll store the 1-indexed indices of the boots. This organization will streamline the matching process.\n\nNow for the greedy algorithm. First, handle all the *exact* matches - the most constrained ones. I'll iterate through each specific color and find the common number of left and right boots with that color. That's the maximum number of pairs I can make with that color. I'll take those indices and add them to the result and remove them from the corresponding lists.\n\nAfter I've exhausted all the direct matches, I need to check for the matches containing a '?'.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (one left, one right) and list the pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are the same (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. A question mark ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or another '?').\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The general strategy for greedy problems involving choices with varying degrees of flexibility is to prioritize the most restrictive matches first. This ensures that boots with limited matching options are used effectively before they are potentially consumed by less restrictive matches, which could be satisfied by other boots.\n\nLet's categorize the types of matches:\n1. **Exact specific color matches:** 'a' with 'a'. These are the most restrictive because both boots must have the exact same specific color.\n2. **Specific color with '?' matches:** 'a' with '?' or '?' with 'a'. These are less restrictive as one boot can be a wildcard.\n3. **'?' with '?' matches:** '?' with '?'. These are the least restrictive, as both boots are wildcards.\n\nBased on this, the greedy strategy is:\n\n**Step 1: Match specific colors with exact same specific colors.**\nFor each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z':\nMatch as many left boots of color `c` with right boots of color `c` as possible.\nThe number of such pairs will be `min(count_of_left_c, count_of_right_c)`.\nThese boots are now used and should not be considered for further matches.\n\n**Step 2: Match remaining specific color boots with '?' boots.**\nAfter Step 1, some specific color boots might be left over if there weren't enough matching specific color boots on the other side. Also, all '?' boots are still available.\nIterate through all specific colors `c` from 'a' to 'z':\nMatch any remaining left boots of color `c` with available right boots of color `'?'`.\nMatch any remaining right boots of color `c` with available left boots of color `'?'`.\nThe number of such pairs will be `min(remaining_left_c, remaining_right_question_mark)` for `left_c` with `right_?`, and similarly for `right_c` with `left_?`.\nPrioritizing specific colors first within this step (e.g., 'a' before 'b') doesn't matter, as '?' matches any specific color.\n\n**Step 3: Match remaining '?' boots with '?' boots.**\nAfter Step 2, any '?' boots that were not used to match specific colors (and any specific color boots that couldn't find a match, though this shouldn't happen for specific colors if there are '?' boots available) are still available.\nMatch any remaining left boots of color `'?'` with any remaining right boots of color `'?'`.\nThe number of such pairs will be `min(remaining_left_question_mark, remaining_right_question_mark)`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\nTo efficiently manage the boots, we can use a list of lists (or a dictionary of lists) for each color.\n`left_indices[char]` will store a list of 1-indexed original indices of left boots with color `char`.\n`right_indices[char]` will store a list of 1-indexed original indices of right boots with color `char`.\n\nFor example, `left_indices['a'] = [idx1, idx2, ...]` and `left_indices['?'] = [idx_q1, idx_q2, ...]`.\n\nLet's refine the steps with this structure:\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    Create `left_indices` and `right_indices` as dictionaries where keys are characters 'a'-'z' and '?', and values are empty lists.\n    Populate these lists by iterating through the input strings `l` and `r`, storing `i+1` (1-indexed) in the appropriate list.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Specific color to specific color matches**\n    For `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n        While `left_indices[c]` is not empty AND `right_indices[c]` is not empty:\n            Take `l_idx = left_indices[c].pop()`\n            Take `r_idx = right_indices[c].pop()`\n            Add `(l_idx, r_idx)` to `result_pairs`.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Specific color to '?' matches**\n    For `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n        While `left_indices[c]` is not empty AND `right_indices['?']` is not empty:\n            Take `l_idx = left_indices[c].pop()`\n            Take `r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()`\n            Add `(l_idx, r_idx)` to `result_pairs`.\n        While `right_indices[c]` is not empty AND `left_indices['?']` is not empty:\n            Take `l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()`\n            Take `r_idx = right_indices[c].pop()`\n            Add `(l_idx, r_idx)` to `result_pairs`.\n\n4.  **Step 3: '?' to '?' matches**\n    While `left_indices['?']` is not empty AND `right_indices['?']` is not empty:\n        Take `l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()`\n        Take `r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()`\n        Add `(l_idx, r_idx)` to `result_pairs`.\n\nFinally, print `len(result_pairs)` and then each pair.\n\nThis greedy strategy works because:\n- Matching specific colors first uses up boots that have the fewest alternative matches.\n- Then, specific color boots that couldn't find an exact match are paired with '?' boots. This is the next most restrictive match for them.\n- Finally, '?' boots are paired with other '?' boots. These are the most flexible and can be used for any remaining match. By this point, all specific color boots have either found an exact match or a match with a '?' boot. The remaining '?' boots can only match other '?' boots.\n\nThe time complexity will be dominated by iterating through the input strings once (O(N)) to populate the lists, and then iterating through the lists to form pairs. In the worst case, all boots could be specific colors or all could be '?', leading to operations proportional to N. Since there are 27 possible \"colors\" (26 letters + '?'), and each boot index is pushed/popped at most once, the total time complexity is O(N + 27 * N) which simplifies to O(N). Given N <= 150,000, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-indexed indices of boots for each color\n    left_indices = {chr(ord('a') + i): [] for i in range(26)}\n    left_indices['?'] = []\n\n    right_indices = {chr(ord('a') + i): [] for i in range(26)}\n    right_indices['?'] = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_indices[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_indices[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    result_pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors with exact same specific colors\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_indices[char] and right_indices[char]:\n            l_idx = left_indices[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices[char].pop()\n            result_pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Step 2: Match remaining specific color boots with '?' boots\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        # Match left specific with right '?'\n        while left_indices[char] and right_indices['?']:\n            l_idx = left_indices[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()\n            result_pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n        # Match right specific with left '?'\n        while right_indices[char] and left_indices['?']:\n            l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices[char].pop()\n            result_pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Step 3: Match remaining '?' boots with '?' boots\n    while left_indices['?'] and right_indices['?']:\n        l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()\n        r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()\n        result_pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Print the results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(result_pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for l_idx, r_idx in result_pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
