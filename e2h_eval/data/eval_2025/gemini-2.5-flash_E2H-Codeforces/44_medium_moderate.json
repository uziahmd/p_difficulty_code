He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Let's crack this \"Polycarp's Practice\" problem!**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to split a list of problem difficulties into a certain number of days, maximizing the sum of the hardest problems solved each day. My initial thought is that the total profit is limited by the `k` largest values in the entire list. If we can make those the maximums on each day, we've got the maximum profit.\n\nI figured out the core idea. I need to take the `k` largest values (including duplicates) and make them the maximums in each of the `k` segments. So, the first step: find those `k` largest values and store their *original* indices. Next, sort these indices and the split strategy became clear! The idea is to make cuts *after* these indices, creating `k` segments. The segment boundaries fall *after* each index, ensuring the corresponding value becomes the maximum for its segment.\n\nSo, for example, if the original indices are `0, 3, 6`, make cuts after `0`, and after `3`. I figured out the lengths of each segments. The formula is a little complex, so I just figured it out.\n\nThe resulting segments guarantee that the `k` largest values, each fall into different segments, and are also the maximums of their segments, maximizing total profit. Perfect! This strategy is solid! Now, implement it.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to partition `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous segments. Each segment represents problems solved on a day. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. We need to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output this maximum profit, along with the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**Understanding the Goal**\n\nTo maximize the sum of `k` daily maximums, a greedy approach seems appropriate. The maximum possible sum of `k` values chosen from an array is simply the sum of the `k` largest values in that array. If we can partition the problems such that each of these `k` largest values becomes the maximum for one of the `k` days, and each day's profit comes from exactly one of these `k` values, then we achieve this maximum possible sum.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n1.  **Identify the `k` largest problems:**\n    *   Create a list of `(difficulty, original_index)` pairs for all problems.\n    *   Sort this list in descending order based on difficulty.\n    *   Take the top `k` pairs. These represent the `k` problems with the highest difficulties.\n    *   The sum of their difficulties is the maximum possible total profit.\n\n2.  **Determine split points for segments:**\n    *   Extract the original indices of these `k` largest problems. Let these be `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-1}`.\n    *   Sort these `k` indices in ascending order. These indices mark the positions of the chosen `k` maximums.\n    *   We need to make `k-1` cuts to divide the `n` problems into `k` segments.\n    *   A simple and effective way to ensure each of our chosen `k` maximums falls into a unique segment and is indeed the maximum of that segment is to make cuts *after* `k-1` of these `k` indices.\n    *   Specifically, we can make cuts after indices `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-2}`.\n    *   This defines the segments as follows:\n        *   Day 1: Problems from index `0` to `p_0`.\n        *   Day 2: Problems from index `p_0 + 1` to `p_1`.\n        *   ...\n        *   Day `j`: Problems from index `p_{j-2} + 1` to `p_{j-1}` (for `j` from 2 to `k-1`).\n        *   Day `k`: Problems from index `p_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1`. (The last segment takes all remaining problems up to the end of the list.)\n\n3.  **Calculate segment lengths:**\n    *   The length of the first segment is `p_0 + 1`.\n    *   For `j` from 2 to `k-1`, the length of the `j`-th segment is `p_{j-1} - p_{j-2}`.\n    *   The length of the `k`-th segment is `n - (p_{k-1} + 1) + 1 = n - p_{k-1}`.\n    *   Let's recheck the sum of lengths: `(p_0 + 1) + (p_1 - p_0) + ... + (p_{k-1} - p_{k-2}) + (n - p_{k-1})`.\n        This is a telescoping sum: `p_0` cancels with `-p_0`, `p_1` cancels with `-p_1`, and so on, until `p_{k-1}` cancels with `-p_{k-1}`.\n        The remaining terms are `1 + n`. This is incorrect. The sum must be `n`.\n\nLet's correct the segment length calculation. The cuts define the *end points* of the first `k-1` segments. The last segment covers the rest.\nLet `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-1}` be the sorted 0-indexed positions of the `k` largest problems.\nWe need `k-1` split points.\nWe will use `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-2}` as the *last problem index for the first `k-1` days*.\nThe segment lengths `t_j` will be:\n*   `t_1 = p_0 + 1` (problems `a[0]` through `a[p_0]`)\n*   `t_2 = p_1 - p_0` (problems `a[p_0+1]` through `a[p_1]`)\n*   ...\n*   `t_{k-1} = p_{k-2} - p_{k-3}` (problems `a[p_{k-3}+1]` through `a[p_{k-2}]`)\n*   `t_k = n - (p_{k-2} + 1)` (problems `a[p_{k-2}+1]` through `a[n-1]`). This is `n - p_{k-2} - 1` problems.\n    No, this `t_k` is still wrong. The `k-1` cuts are *after* `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-2}`.\n    The segment lengths are simply the differences between these sorted indices, plus `p_0+1` for the first segment and `n - p_{k-1}` for the last segment.\n\nLet the sorted indices of the `k` largest problems be `idx_0, idx_1, ..., idx_{k-1}`.\nThe split points are just these indices themselves.\n`current_idx = -1` (represents the end of the previous segment, initially before index 0)\nFor `j` from `0` to `k-2`:\n  `t_{j+1} = idx_j - current_idx`\n  `current_idx = idx_j`\nThe last segment:\n  `t_k = n - current_idx - 1` (This is the number of remaining problems from `current_idx + 1` to `n-1`)\nThis is the correct way to get the lengths.\n\nExample: `n=8, k=3, a=[5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n1.  `k=3` largest values: `9` (idx 6), `6` (idx 3), `5` (idx 0).\n2.  Total profit: `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n3.  Sorted indices of these problems: `idx_0=0, idx_1=3, idx_2=6`.\n4.  Calculate segment lengths:\n    *   `current_idx = -1`\n    *   `j=0`: `t_1 = idx_0 - current_idx = 0 - (-1) = 1`. `current_idx = 0`.\n    *   `j=1`: `t_2 = idx_1 - current_idx = 3 - 0 = 3`. `current_idx = 3`.\n    *   We have `k-1 = 2` segments processed this way. The remaining `k-(k-1)=1` segment is `t_k`.\n    *   `t_3 = n - current_idx - 1 = 8 - 3 - 1 = 4`.\n    *   Wait, the sum is `1+3+4 = 8`. This is `n`. This is correct!\n    *   The output lengths are `1, 3, 4`.\n    *   This matches my manual derivation earlier.\n\nLet's re-verify why this ensures maximums.\nFor segment `j` (ending at `idx_j` for `j < k-1`, or `n-1` for `j=k-1`), the element `a[idx_j]` is one of the `k` largest values. Any element `a[p]` within this segment *before* `idx_j` must have `p < idx_j`. If `a[p]` were one of the `k` largest values, its index `p` would be among `idx_0, ..., idx_{k-1}`. But `idx_j` is the smallest index among the `k` largest values that is greater than or equal to `p`. So `a[p]` cannot be larger than `a[idx_j]` (or any of the `k` largest values). Thus, `a[idx_j]` is indeed the maximum in its segment.\n\nThis strategy is robust and gives a correct answer.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the array `a`.\n3.  Create `value_index_pairs = []`. Iterate `i` from `0` to `n-1`, append `(a[i], i)` to `value_index_pairs`.\n4.  Sort `value_index_pairs` by `value` in descending order.\n5.  Extract the `k` largest values and sum them for `max_profit`.\n6.  Extract the original indices of these `k` largest problems. Store them in a list `split_indices`.\n7.  Sort `split_indices` in ascending order.\n8.  Initialize `t_lengths = []` and `prev_idx = -1`.\n9.  Iterate `idx` in `split_indices`:\n    *   `t_lengths.append(idx - prev_idx)`\n    *   `prev_idx = idx`\n10. The last segment's length is `n - prev_idx - 1`.\n    *   `t_lengths[-1] += (n - 1 - prev_idx)` (Add problems from `prev_idx+1` to `n-1` to the last segment that ended at `prev_idx`). This is not quite right. The last segment should cover all problems from `prev_idx+1` to `n-1`.\n    *   A simpler way to handle `t_k`:\n        `t_lengths = []`\n        `last_cut_pos = -1`\n        For `i` from `0` to `k-2`:\n            `t_lengths.append(split_indices[i] - last_cut_pos)`\n            `last_cut_pos = split_indices[i]`\n        `t_lengths.append(n - last_cut_pos - 1)`\n    This logic for `t_k` is still tricky. Let's use the explicit segment calculation:\n    `t_lengths = []`\n    `last_end_idx = -1`\n    For `i` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        `current_end_idx = split_indices[i]`\n        `t_lengths.append(current_end_idx - last_end_idx)`\n        `last_end_idx = current_end_idx`\n    `t_lengths.append(n - 1 - last_end_idx)` (This is the number of problems from `last_end_idx+1` to `n-1`)\n    This is `n - (last_end_idx + 1)`.\n    Let's check `n=8, k=3`, `split_indices=[0, 3, 6]`.\n    `last_end_idx = -1`\n    `i=0`: `current_end_idx = 0`. `t_lengths.append(0 - (-1)) = [1]`. `last_end_idx = 0`.\n    `i=1`: `current_end_idx = 3`. `t_lengths.append(3 - 0) = [1, 3]`. `last_end_idx = 3`.\n    Loop ends.\n    `t_lengths.append(n - (last_end_idx + 1)) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 8 - 4 = 4`.\n    Final `t_lengths = [1, 3, 4]`. This is correct.\n\n11. Print `max_profit`.\n12. Print `t_lengths` space-separated.\n\n**Constraints Check:**\n`n, k <= 2000`. Sorting `n` pairs takes `O(N log N)`. Extracting `k` indices and sorting them takes `O(k log k)`. Calculating lengths is `O(k)`. Overall complexity is dominated by sorting, `O(N log N)`, which is fine for `N=2000`. `2000 log 2000` is roughly `2000 * 11 = 22000` operations, very fast. Memory usage is `O(N)` for storing pairs, also fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Create (difficulty, original_index) pairs\n    value_index_pairs = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        value_index_pairs.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort by difficulty in descending order\n    # If difficulties are equal, the original index order doesn't matter for sum,\n    # but sorting by index ascending can provide a canonical choice for split points.\n    # Python's sort is stable, so original relative order of equal elements is preserved.\n    # Sorting by value descending, then index ascending (implicitly handled by tuple sort if values are equal)\n    # is a good strategy.\n    value_index_pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Step 3: Select the k largest problems\n    top_k_problems = value_index_pairs[:k]\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate maximum total profit\n    max_profit = sum(p[0] for p in top_k_problems)\n    print(max_profit)\n\n    # Step 5: Get original indices of these k problems and sort them\n    split_indices = sorted([p[1] for p in top_k_problems])\n\n    # Step 6: Calculate segment lengths\n    t_lengths = []\n    last_end_idx = -1 # Represents the index of the last problem solved on the previous day (-1 for before problem 0)\n\n    for i in range(k - 1):\n        # The current split point is split_indices[i]\n        # This means problems from last_end_idx + 1 up to split_indices[i] form a segment\n        t_lengths.append(split_indices[i] - last_end_idx)\n        last_end_idx = split_indices[i]\n    \n    # The last segment takes all problems from last_end_idx + 1 to n-1\n    t_lengths.append(n - (last_end_idx + 1))\n\n    # Step 7: Print segment lengths\n    print(*(t_lengths))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
