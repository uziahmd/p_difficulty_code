Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"New Year Candles\" problem. Seems straightforward enough at first glance. It's essentially about maximizing the number of hours I can light a room given an initial number of candles and a crafting ratio. My initial thought is that it's a simulation problem – I can just step through the process, keeping track of my resources.\n\nI'm thinking, I start with `a` candles. Each one burns for an hour. Then, I get `b` burnt-out candles which, when grouped together, create 1 new candle.  So, I need to find the total hours I can light the room. That's the total number of new candles I can light.\n\nI've got this example – `a = 4, b = 2`. Let's walk through it. I can light those 4 candles, so 4 hours.  Then I have 4 burnt-out candles, which gives me 2 new ones. So, light those for 2 hours. Now I have 2 burnt out, which gives me 1 new.  Light for 1 hour. I end up with 1 burnt-out, but can't make anymore so it's over. That's 7 hours total, and that's the answer.\n\nAlright, the core idea is pretty clear now. I need a loop. I initialize a few variables: `total_hours`, `current_new_candles`, and `burnt_out_candles`. The loop's condition is where the magic happens. I can keep going as long as I have new candles *or* I have enough burnt-out ones to craft something new. Each iteration of the loop, I need to:\n\n1.  Light all the `current_new_candles`, increasing `total_hours`.\n2.  Add those burnt-out candles to the total.\n3.  Calculate how many new candles I can make from the burnt-out ones.\n4.  Update `current_new_candles` to reflect that crafting.\n5.  If any burnt candles are left over, update the accumulator as well.\n\nThis is starting to crystallize now. The crafting step is `burnt_out_candles // b` gives me the new candles, and `burnt_out_candles % b` are the leftover ones to be used later. I should be able to whip up a Python script to handle this simulation pretty quickly. Seems like a nice, clean algorithm.\n",
