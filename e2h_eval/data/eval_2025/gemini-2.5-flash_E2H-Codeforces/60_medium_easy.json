Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Counting Morse Code Sequences**\n\nAlright, here's how I'm thinking about this problem.  We're given a string that grows character by character, and after each addition, we need to count all the unique sequences of English letters that can be formed from substrings of that string. The Morse code aspect adds a twist: each letter corresponds to a Morse code representation, and we need to determine how many valid sequences we can construct.\n\nFirst, let's establish the ground rules.  Morse code lengths are between 1 and 4 characters long. We have 26 letters, so theoretically, there are 30 possible combinations (2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4). However, there are a few invalid codes (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\"). This leaves us with 26 valid codes corresponding to each letter.\n\nThe challenge is the dynamic nature of the string and the substring requirement.  It seems like a dynamic programming approach will be essential. I'm going to focus on a `dp` array. I'll define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to parse the suffix of the string starting at index `i` into valid sequences of letters.  `dp[L]` will be 1 (where `L` is the length of the string, and represents the empty suffix).\n\nFor each character appended to the string `S`, creating a new string `S'` of length `L`.\n\n- I'll create an `dp` array.\n- Now, start with `dp[L] = 1`.\n- For index `i` from `L-1` down to 0, compute `dp[i]` as follows:\n    - Initialize `dp[i] = 0`.\n    - For each length `len` from 1 to 4:\n        - I'll consider substring `S[i : i + len]`.\n        - If `S[i : i + len]` is a valid morse code, then add `dp[i + len]` to `dp[i]`. I'll also do it modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThe total number of unique sequences will then be the sum of `dp[i]` for `i` from 0 to `L-1`. Then, print the total number of sequences for each step.\n\nThis seems to be the right track. My main concern is about the efficiency of this DP.  I need to make sure I'm not recomputing everything from scratch with each character append.  But, the limited Morse code length should allow me to keep the overall time complexity under control.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by concatenating Morse code representations, where the concatenated Morse code string is a substring of a given string `S`. The string `S` is built by appending '0's or '1's one at a time, and we need to report the count after each append operation, modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nFirst, let's identify the valid Morse code representations. English letters are represented by strings of '0's (dots) and '1's (dashes) of length 1 to 4. There are `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30` such strings. Four of these are explicitly stated as invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". This leaves `30 - 4 = 26` valid Morse code strings, each corresponding to a distinct English letter.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `L`. We are interested in counting non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by *any substring* of `S`.\nA sequence of English letters `L_1, L_2, ..., L_p` corresponds to a Morse code string `M_1 M_2 ... M_p`, where `M_i` is the Morse code for `L_i`. If this concatenated string `M_1 M_2 ... M_p` is equal to a substring `S[i...j]`, then this sequence `(L_1, ..., L_p)` contributes to the total count.\n\nLet's define `dp[k]` as the number of ways to parse the suffix `S[k...L-1]` into a sequence of English letters.\nThe base case is `dp[L] = 1`, representing one way to parse an empty string (into an empty sequence of letters).\nFor `k` from `L-1` down to `0`:\n`dp[k]` is the sum of `dp[k + length]` for all possible valid Morse code lengths (`length` from 1 to 4) such that `S[k ... k + length - 1]` is a valid Morse code.\nSpecifically:\n`dp[k] = 0`\nFor `length` in `{1, 2, 3, 4}`:\n  If `k + length <= L` (i.e., the substring `S[k ... k + length - 1]` exists within `S`):\n    Let `substring = S[k ... k + length - 1]`.\n    If `substring` is a valid Morse code (i.e., its length is 1-4 and it's not one of the four invalid codes):\n      `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k + length]) % MOD`\n\nAfter computing all `dp[k]` values for `k` from `L-1` down to `0`, the total number of non-empty sequences of English letters represented by substrings of `S` is `sum(dp[k] for k in range(L))`.\nWhy? Each `dp[k]` represents the number of ways to parse the suffix `S[k...L-1]` into a sequence of letters. This definition implicitly includes all possible non-empty prefixes of `S[k...L-1]`.\nFor example, if `S[k...L-1]` can be parsed as `M_1 M_2 ... M_p`, then `dp[k]` counts this. It also counts `M_1`, `M_1 M_2`, etc.\nConsider `S = \"111\"`.\n`L=3`. `dp[3] = 1`.\n`k=2`: `S[2] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid. `dp[2] = dp[2+1] = dp[3] = 1`.\n`k=1`: `S[1] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid. `dp[1] += dp[1+1] = dp[2] = 1`.\n        `S[1...2] = \"11\"`. \"11\" is valid. `dp[1] += dp[1+2] = dp[3] = 1`.\n        So `dp[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n`k=0`: `S[0] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid. `dp[0] += dp[0+1] = dp[1] = 2`.\n        `S[0...1] = \"11\"`. \"11\" is valid. `dp[0] += dp[0+2] = dp[2] = 1`.\n        `S[0...2] = \"111\"`. \"111\" is valid. `dp[0] += dp[0+3] = dp[3] = 1`.\n        So `dp[0] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.\nThe total answer for \"111\" is `dp[0] + dp[1] + dp[2] = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7`. This matches the example.\n\nWhen a new character is appended to `S`, increasing its length from `L-1` to `L`, we need to recompute the `dp` array for the new `S`. Since `m` (maximum length of `S`) is 3000, and each `dp` array computation takes `O(L)` time, the total time complexity will be `O(m^2)`.\n`3000^2 = 9 * 10^6` operations, which is efficient enough.\n\n**Detailed Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n2.  Define the set of `INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n3.  Initialize an empty list `S_chars` to store characters of `S`.\n4.  Initialize a `dp` array of size `m + 5` (or `m + 1`) with zeros. This `dp` array will store `dp[k]` values for the current string `S`.\n5.  Initialize `current_total_ans = 0`.\n6.  For each of the `m` input characters `c`:\n    a.  Append `c` to `S_chars`.\n    b.  Let `L = len(S_chars)` (the current length of `S`).\n    c.  Set `dp[L] = 1` (base case for the empty suffix).\n    d.  Iterate `k` from `L-1` down to `0`:\n        i.   Set `dp[k] = 0`.\n        ii.  For `length` from `1` to `4`:\n            1.  If `k + length <= L`:\n                a.  Extract the `substring = \"\".join(S_chars[k : k + length])`.\n                b.  If `substring` is not in `INVALID_CODES`:\n                    `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k + length]) % MOD`.\n    e.  Calculate the sum of all `dp[k]` for `k` from `0` to `L-1`:\n        `current_total_ans = 0`\n        For `k` from `0` to `L-1`:\n            `current_total_ans = (current_total_ans + dp[k]) % MOD`\n    f.  Print `current_total_ans`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n    INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n    s_chars = []\n    # dp[k] will store the number of ways to parse the suffix S[k...L-1]\n    # dp array size needs to be up to m+1 for dp[L]\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1) \n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char_to_append = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        s_chars.append(char_to_append)\n        L = len(s_chars)\n\n        # Base case: dp[L] represents the empty suffix, which can be parsed in 1 way (empty sequence)\n        dp[L] = 1\n\n        # Calculate dp[k] for k from L-1 down to 0\n        for k in range(L - 1, -1, -1):\n            dp[k] = 0\n            # Try all possible Morse code lengths (1 to 4)\n            for length in range(1, 5):\n                if k + length <= L:\n                    substring = \"\".join(s_chars[k : k + length])\n                    \n                    # Check if the substring is a valid Morse code\n                    # Length check is implicitly handled by length loop and k+length <= L\n                    if substring not in INVALID_CODES:\n                        dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k + length]) % MOD\n        \n        # The total answer is the sum of dp[k] for all k from 0 to L-1\n        # Each dp[k] counts sequences starting at index k and ending at any position up to L-1\n        current_total_ans = 0\n        for k in range(L):\n            current_total_ans = (current_total_ans + dp[k]) % MOD\n        \n        sys.stdout.write(str(current_total_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
