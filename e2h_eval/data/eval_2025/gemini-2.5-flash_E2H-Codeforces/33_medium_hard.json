You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Digit Replacement Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core of this problem is to maximize a number, `a`, by strategically replacing its digits with digits from a sequence, `s`.  The key insight is that to maximize a number, the most significant digits (leftmost) need to be as large as possible.\n\nMy strategy is to iterate through `a` from left to right. For each digit in `a`, I'll check if I can replace it with a larger digit from `s`, ensuring that I only use each digit from `s` once.  The best way to do this efficiently seems to be using frequency counts for the digits in `s` – a list where `counts[d]` tells me how many times the digit `d` is available in `s`.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input and initialize the frequency count array. Then, I'll iterate through the digits of `a`.  For each digit in `a`, I'll look for the largest digit in `s` that's greater than the current digit, and is still available (its count is greater than zero). If I find such a digit, I replace the current digit in `a`, decrement the count, and move on. If not, I keep the current digit and move to the next.\n\nThe time complexity of this should be O(n + m), where n is the length of `a` and m is the length of `s`, which is suitable for the given constraints. The space complexity is O(1) in addition to the input, as I only need a count of size 10.\n",
