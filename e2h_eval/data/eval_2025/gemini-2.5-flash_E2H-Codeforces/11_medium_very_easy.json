A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The \"Soft Drinking\" Problem: My Solution Process**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Soft Drinking\" problem. The goal is to figure out the maximum number of toasts everyone can make, given the resources. I've broken down the problem into these steps:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Objective:**  We need to calculate the maximum number of toasts *per person*, ensuring everyone makes the same amount.\n\n2.  **Resource Identification:** I've identified the key variables: number of friends (`n`), drink bottles (`k`), drink volume per bottle (`l`), limes (`c`), lime slices per lime (`d`), salt (`p`), drink needed per toast (`nl`), and salt needed per toast (`np`).\n\n3.  **Total Resource Calculation:** I've calculated the total amounts available: total drink is `k * l` milliliters, total lime slices are `c * d`, and total salt is `p` grams.\n\n4.  **Individual Toast Limits (Initial Assessment):** Initially, I considered how many toasts *one* person could make using each resource individually. For drink, that's `(k * l) // nl` (using integer division). For limes, it's simply `c * d` total slices. And for salt, it's `p // np`.\n\n5.  **The \"Per Friend\" Constraint:** The critical point is that each friend needs drink, a lime slice, and salt *per toast*. This means the total resource pool must be split amongst all the friends.\n\n6.  **Revised Calculation (Per Friend):**  This changed everything! Now, I realized the problem is about resources *per friend*, per toast. I need to find the *maximum* number of toasts *each* friend can make, not just the total across everyone.  Let `X` be the number of toasts *per friend*.\n\n    *   **Drink:** Total drink needed: `n * X * nl`. Available: `k * l`. So, `X <= (k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n    *   **Limes:**  Total slices needed: `n * X`. Available: `c * d`. So, `X <= (c * d) // n`.\n    *   **Salt:**  Total salt needed: `n * X * np`. Available: `p`. So, `X <= p // (n * np)`.\n\n7.  **Finding the Limiting Factor:**  The maximum number of toasts is the *minimum* of these individual limits.  I need to calculate `min((k * l) // (n * nl), (c * d) // n, p // (n * np))`. That's the key.\n\n8.  **Final Answer:**  That `min` value is the answer! I just need to print it.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\nI'll write the Python code like this:\n1.  Read the input line.\n2.  Split the input into numbers and convert them to integers.\n3.  Calculate the three maximum \"toasts per friend\" based on each resource.\n4.  Find the minimum of those three values and print it.\n\nThe Python `//` operator handles integer division nicely, so no need for floor functions explicitly. The limits on the input variables make the integer calculations safe (no overflow). Let's write the code!\n",
