            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Average Sleep Time\n\nIt's been almost a week since Polycarp couldn't get rid of insomnia. And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my thought process:** The problem is to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\" within a given dataset of sleep records. A \"week\" consists of *k* consecutive days. I've got *n* sleep times, and I need to find the average sleep time across all the overlapping *k*-day windows.\n\nMy first thought was a straightforward, brute-force approach. For each possible starting day of a week, calculate the sum of sleep times for that *k*-day period, and then compute the average. But that would be slow. I quickly realized this would take *O(n*k)* time, which is too slow given the constraints.  The biggest values of n and k would give about `2*10^10` operations, which is too many to complete within the 1-2 second timeframe.\n\nThen, I started thinking about optimization.  I noticed the overlap between consecutive weeks. The sum for the next week, *S(i+1)*,  only differs from the current week, *S(i)*, by one element leaving and one entering the \"window.\" This is a classic sliding window scenario!  I can compute *S(i+1)* from *S(i)* in constant time, *O(1)*:  `S(i+1) = S(i) - a[i-1] + a[i+k]`.\n\nThis significantly reduces the complexity. I calculate the sum of the first week, *S(1)*, in *O(k)* time. Then, I can iterate through the rest of the weeks and compute each subsequent sum in *O(1)* using the sliding window technique. This gives me an overall time complexity of *O(n)*, which should be fast enough.\n\nI verified the edge cases (when *k=n* and *k=1*) and confirmed that my optimized solution produces the correct results. Both cases work correctly because the loops behave the way I expect, and correctly calculate one week when k=n or n weeks when k=1. I've also done a sample trace of the algorithm on the example given in the problem statement and the algorithm matches the results.\n\nI also thought about using prefix sums for another *O(n)* solution. Prefix sums would allow me to calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time, *O(1)*. Although this also results in an *O(n)* solution, the sliding window is more efficient in space, since no additional array (beyond the input array) is needed. I decided to stick with the sliding window.\n\nI've made some final checks for potential overflow issues. Python's integers are unbounded, so overflows aren't a concern. The final average will be a float, and float operations are fast. So, I don't need to worry about the precision. I'm going to format the output with 10 decimal places, just to be safe.\n\nFinally, I'm confident that the code will solve the problem efficiently and correctly. I think I'm ready to write the code.\n",
