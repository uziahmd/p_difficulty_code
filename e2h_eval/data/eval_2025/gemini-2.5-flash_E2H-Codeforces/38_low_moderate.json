    "thought": "**Problem Dissection for Optimal Graph Construction**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem and my immediate thought is to break it down piece by piece. The core is to design a directed graph that's *p*-reachable. Let's make sure we're on the same page here. We need to find the smallest number of nodes (`N`) and then, among those minimal graphs, maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nFirst, let's nail down what 'reachability' means. We're talking about nodes being able to get to each other, a two-way street.  That translates directly to Strongly Connected Components, or SCCs, in graph theory terms. Two nodes are reachable from each other if they belong to the same SCC.\n\nNow, that *p*-reachable condition, that's the heart of the matter.  It's all about ordered pairs (u,v) where u < v and they're in the same SCC. If we've got an SCC with *k* nodes, and they're ordered (n1 < n2 ... < nk),  we know that any two nodes within the SCC have a path both ways between them. The problem cleverly asks for only the pairs where u < v, so if we have k nodes in an SCC, there will be k*(k-1)/2 pairs that satisfy this condition. The sum of these pairs across all SCCs needs to equal *p*.\n\nNext, we define a unidirectional pair. This is about nodes from *different* SCCs.  It's a one-way trip: a path from `u` to `v` exists, but there's no path back. This implies we are talking about different SCCs and this can be visualized as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) whose nodes are SCCs.  So, if we have an edge from the SCC of `u` to the SCC of `v` but not the other way around, we have a unidirectional pair. So the problem wants us to maximize these kinds of pairs.\n\nNow I need to devise an algorithm. My mind is already starting to piece this together based on these definitions... I think I have a plan...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `N` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all `p`-reachable directed graphs with `N` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's define the terms:\n- **Reachability:** Nodes `u` and `v` are reachable from each other if there's a path `u -> v` and a path `v -> u`. This means `u` and `v` belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\n- **`p`-reachable graph:** A graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n- **Unidirectional pair:** An ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u != v`, there's a path `u -> v`, and there are no paths `v -> u`. This implies `u` and `v` are in different SCCs.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum Number of Nodes (N)**\n\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC are reachable from each other. The number of pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` within this SCC is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nThe total `p` is the sum of `k * (k - 1) / 2` over all SCCs in the graph.\n\nLet `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2`. This function `f(k)` represents the number of pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` within an SCC of size `k`.\nWe want to find the minimum `N` such that `p` can be expressed as `sum(f(k_i))` where `sum(k_i) = N`.\n\nThe function `f(k)` is convex and grows quadratically. To minimize `N` for a fixed `p`, we should use as few SCCs as possible, and those SCCs should be as large as possible. This means we should try to form `p` using one large SCC, then two large SCCs, and so on.\n\nLet `N` be the total number of nodes.\nThe maximum possible value for `p` for a graph with `N` nodes is `f(N) = N * (N - 1) / 2`, which occurs if all `N` nodes form a single SCC.\nWe are looking for the smallest `N` such that `f(N) >= p`.\nLet's find the smallest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 >= p`.\nWe can iterate `k` starting from 1.\n`f(1) = 0`\n`f(2) = 1`\n`f(3) = 3`\n`f(4) = 6`\n...\nSince `p` can be up to `2 * 10^5`, `N * (N - 1) / 2` is roughly `N^2 / 2`. So `N^2` is roughly `4 * 10^5`, and `N` is roughly `sqrt(4 * 10^5) = sqrt(40 * 10^4) = 20 * 10^2 = 632`.\nWe can iterate `k` from 1 up to about 633 to find the smallest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 >= p`. Let this `k` be `k_max`.\n\nIf `p = 0`, then `N=1` is sufficient (one node, no pairs). `f(1)=0`.\nIf `p > 0`, we find `k_max`.\nIf `f(k_max) = p`, then we can form `p` using a single SCC of size `k_max`. The minimum number of nodes is `k_max`.\nIf `f(k_max) > p`, then we need to form `p` using smaller SCCs. It's always optimal to use one large SCC of size `k_max - 1`, and then form the remaining `p - f(k_max - 1)` using smaller SCCs.\nLet `p_rem = p - f(k_max - 1)`.\nSince `f(k_max - 1) < p < f(k_max)`, we have `0 < p_rem < k_max - 1`.\nWe need to form `p_rem` pairs. Each additional node we add can form `0` pairs (if it's a singleton SCC) or `1` pair if it's connected to one other node (e.g., in an SCC of size 2). To form `p_rem` pairs with minimum additional nodes, we can simply add `p_rem` nodes, each forming an SCC of size 2 with one of the nodes in the `k_max-1` SCC. This is not how it works.\nThe most efficient way to form `p_rem` pairs with minimum additional nodes is to add `p_rem` nodes as singleton SCCs. No, this would not add any pairs.\nThe most efficient way to form `p_rem` pairs is to add `p_rem` nodes and make them part of the existing `k_max-1` SCC. But we just said `k_max` is the largest possible size.\nThe strategy for minimizing `N` is to make one SCC as large as possible, say of size `k_1`, such that `f(k_1) <= p`. Then we need to satisfy `p - f(k_1)` using minimum additional nodes. The remaining `p - f(k_1)` pairs must be formed by nodes that are *not* part of the `k_1` SCC. Each such pair `(u,v)` requires at least 2 nodes. If we add `m` nodes to form `m` pairs, we need `m` nodes. For example, `m` SCCs of size 2. These would use `2m` nodes and contribute `m` pairs.\nHowever, if we have an SCC of size `k`, and we add one more node to it, making it size `k+1`, it adds `f(k+1) - f(k) = k` pairs. So, adding one node contributes `k` pairs.\nThe problem is to find `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m` such that `sum(f(k_i)) = p` and `sum(k_i)` is minimized.\nThis is a variation of the change-making problem. Since `f(k)` grows fast, and `p` is relatively small, we can use a greedy approach.\nFind the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= p`. Use an SCC of size `k`. Then recursively solve for `p - f(k)`.\nLet `N_min = 0`.\nWhile `p > 0`:\n  Find the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= p`.\n  `N_min += k`\n  `p -= f(k)`\nThis greedy approach works because `f(k)` grows faster than `k`. Specifically, `f(k+1) - f(k) = k`. If we have `p` remaining pairs, and we can choose to form them with a `k`-node SCC (cost `k` nodes) or `k` 1-node SCCs (cost `k` nodes, 0 pairs) or `k` 2-node SCCs (cost `2k` nodes, `k` pairs).\nThe greedy choice is always optimal for this specific problem.\nExample: `p = 3`.\n  `k=1, f(1)=0`. `k=2, f(2)=1`. `k=3, f(3)=3`.\n  Largest `k` s.t. `f(k) <= 3` is `k=3`.\n  `N_min = 3`. `p = 3 - f(3) = 0`.\n  Result: `N_min = 3`.\n\nExample: `p = 4`.\n  `k=1, f(1)=0`. `k=2, f(2)=1`. `k=3, f(3)=3`. `k=4, f(4)=6`.\n  Largest `k` s.t. `f(k) <= 4` is `k=3`.\n  `N_min = 3`. `p = 4 - f(3) = 1`.\n  Now `p = 1`. Largest `k` s.t. `f(k) <= 1` is `k=2`.\n  `N_min = 3 + 2 = 5`. `p = 1 - f(2) = 0`.\n  Result: `N_min = 5`.\nThis greedy strategy correctly finds the minimum number of nodes `N`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum Unidirectional Pairs**\n\nLet `N` be the minimum number of nodes found in Part 1. We need to maximize unidirectional pairs for a graph with `N` nodes.\nA pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, there's a path `u -> v`, but no path `v -> u`.\nIf we have `m` SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, where `sum(k_i) = N`.\nIf there's a path from SCC `S_i` to SCC `S_j` (but not `S_j` to `S_i`), then all `k_i` nodes in `S_i` form unidirectional pairs with all `k_j` nodes in `S_j`. This contributes `k_i * k_j` unidirectional pairs.\nTo maximize this, we want to create a linear chain of SCCs in the condensation graph.\nLet the SCCs be `S_1, S_2, ..., S_m`. We arrange them in a chain: `S_1 -> S_2 -> ... -> S_m`.\nFor any `i < j`, there's a path `S_i -> S_j`. For any `j > i`, there's no path `S_j -> S_i`.\nSo, for any `i < j`, all `k_i` nodes in `S_i` form unidirectional pairs with all `k_j` nodes in `S_j`. This contributes `k_i * k_j` pairs.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} (k_i * k_j)`.\nThis sum is `( (sum(k_i))^2 - sum(k_i^2) ) / 2`.\nSince `sum(k_i) = N` is fixed, this simplifies to `(N^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\nTo maximize this sum, we need to minimize `sum(k_i^2)`.\nThis is a well-known result: to minimize the sum of squares of positive integers that sum to `N`, the integers should be as close to each other as possible.\nIn our greedy strategy for minimizing `N`, we obtain a set of SCC sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`.\nFor `p=3`, `k_1=3`. `N=3`. `sum(k_i^2) = 3^2 = 9`. Unidirectional pairs = `(3^2 - 9) / 2 = 0`. (One SCC, no unidirectional pairs).\nFor `p=4`, `k_1=3, k_2=2`. `N=5`. `sum(k_i^2) = 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 13`. Unidirectional pairs = `(5^2 - 13) / 2 = (25 - 13) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6`.\n\nThe greedy decomposition of `p` into `f(k_i)` values naturally gives us the `k_i` values that minimize `sum(k_i^2)`. This is because the greedy strategy uses the largest possible `k` at each step, making the `k_i` values as close as possible (or rather, as few as possible, and thus each `k_i` is large). If we have `p = f(k_a) + f(k_b)`, and `k_a` is much larger than `k_b`, then `k_a^2 + k_b^2` would be smaller than if we broke `k_a` into smaller components. For example, `f(4) = 6`. `N=4`. `sum(k_i^2) = 16`. Unidirectional = 0.\n`p=6`. `N=4`. `k_1=4`. `sum(k_i^2) = 4^2 = 16`. Unidirectional = 0.\n`p=5`. `N=5` (from `k=3, p_rem=2` -> `k=2, p_rem=0`? No, `p=5` is `f(3)=3` and `f(2)=1` and `f(1)=0`. `N=3+2+1=6`.\nLet's re-verify the greedy strategy for `N`.\n`p = 5`:\n  Largest `k` s.t. `f(k) <= 5` is `k=3` (`f(3)=3`).\n  `N_min = 3`. `p_rem = 5 - 3 = 2`.\n  Now `p_rem = 2`. Largest `k` s.t. `f(k) <= 2` is `k=2` (`f(2)=1`).\n  `N_min = 3 + 2 = 5`. `p_rem = 2 - 1 = 1`.\n  Now `p_rem = 1`. Largest `k` s.t. `f(k) <= 1` is `k=2` (`f(2)=1`).\n  `N_min = 5 + 2 = 7`. `p_rem = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n  The SCC sizes are `[3, 2, 2]`. Total nodes `N=7`.\n  `sum(k_i^2) = 3^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 + 4 = 17`.\n  Unidirectional pairs = `(7^2 - 17) / 2 = (49 - 17) / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16`.\n\nThe problem statement for `p=3` gives `3 0`. Our method gives `N=3`, unidirectional `0`.\nThe problem statement for `p=4` gives `5 6`. Our method gives `N=5`, unidirectional `6`.\nThe problem statement for `p=0` gives `0 0`. Our method:\n  `p=0`: loop doesn't run. `N_min = 0`. `sum_sq_k = 0`. Unidirectional = `(0^2 - 0) / 2 = 0`.\n  Wait, if `p=0`, `N=0` nodes means no graph. A graph with `N=1` node has `p=0` pairs. So `N=1` is the minimum.\n  If `p=0`, `N_min = 1` (one node, one SCC of size 1). `sum_sq_k = 1^2 = 1`.\n  Unidirectional pairs = `(1^2 - 1) / 2 = 0`.\n  So for `p=0`, output `1 0`. The example says `0 0`. This implies that `N` can be 0.\n  If `N=0`, there are no nodes, so no pairs `(u,v)` with `u<v`, so `p=0`. Also no unidirectional pairs.\n  This is a convention. Usually, a graph must have at least one node. But if `N=0` is allowed for `p=0`, then `0 0` is correct. Let's assume `N=0` is allowed for `p=0` and `N>=1` for `p>0`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `N_min = 0`, `sum_sq_k = 0`.\n2. If `p == 0`:\n   `N_min = 0` (as per example output `0 0`).\n   `max_unidirectional = 0`.\n3. If `p > 0`:\n   While `p > 0`:\n     Find largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`.\n     This can be done by iterating `k` from 1 upwards.\n     `k_val = 0`\n     `for k_curr in range(1, 633):` (max k is about 632)\n       `if k_curr * (k_curr - 1) // 2 <= p:`\n         `k_val = k_curr`\n       `else:`\n         `break`\n     `N_min += k_val`\n     `sum_sq_k += k_val * k_val`\n     `p -= k_val * (k_val - 1) // 2`\n   `max_unidirectional = (N_min * N_min - sum_sq_k) // 2`\n\nLet's check the maximum value of `k`.\n`k * (k - 1) / 2 <= 2 * 10^5`\n`k^2 - k <= 4 * 10^5`\n`k^2 approx 4 * 10^5`\n`k approx sqrt(4 * 10^5) = sqrt(400000) approx 632.4`. So `k` up to 632 or 633 is enough.\nThe loop for `k_val` runs at most ~633 times. The `while p > 0` loop runs at most `N_min` times, which is also at most ~633 times. So the overall complexity is fine.\n\nLet's dry run `p=5` again with the algorithm.\n`p = 5`.\n`N_min = 0`, `sum_sq_k = 0`.\nLoop 1:\n  `k_val = 0`.\n  `k_curr=1`: `0 <= 5`, `k_val = 1`.\n  `k_curr=2`: `1 <= 5`, `k_val = 2`.\n  `k_curr=3`: `3 <= 5`, `k_val = 3`.\n  `k_curr=4`: `6 > 5`, break.\n  So `k_val = 3`.\n  `N_min = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n  `sum_sq_k = 0 + 3*3 = 9`.\n  `p = 5 - (3*2//2) = 5 - 3 = 2`.\nLoop 2:\n  `p = 2`.\n  `k_val = 0`.\n  `k_curr=1`: `0 <= 2`, `k_val = 1`.\n  `k_curr=2`: `1 <= 2`, `k_val = 2`.\n  `k_curr=3`: `3 > 2`, break.\n  So `k_val = 2`.\n  `N_min = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n  `sum_sq_k = 9 + 2*2 = 13`.\n  `p = 2 - (2*1//2) = 2 - 1 = 1`.\nLoop 3:\n  `p = 1`.\n  `k_val = 0`.\n  `k_curr=1`: `0 <= 1`, `k_val = 1`.\n  `k_curr=2`: `1 <= 1`, `k_val = 2`.\n  `k_curr=3`: `3 > 1`, break.\n  So `k_val = 2`.\n  `N_min = 5 + 2 = 7`.\n  `sum_sq_k = 13 + 2*2 = 17`.\n  `p = 1 - (2*1//2) = 1 - 1 = 0`.\nLoop 4: `p = 0`, loop terminates.\n`max_unidirectional = (N_min * N_min - sum_sq_k) // 2 = (7*7 - 17) // 2 = (49 - 17) // 2 = 32 // 2 = 16`.\nResult for `p=5`: `7 16`.\n\nThis confirms the calculation for `p=5`.
