Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Strategy for the TV Game Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"TV Game\" problem. The core is about optimizing the sum of two numbers, `S1` and `S2`, formed by Homer and Marge taking turns with digits from a given number `A`.  The trick is that where each digit ends up *really* matters because of the power of 10 in its place value.\n\nInitially, I visualized the problem and went through some examples to understand the number formation. I thought about all possible move sequences (HHMM, HMHM, etc.), but that quickly became way too complex. So, my focus shifted to figuring out the optimal way to allocate digits.\n\nI'm thinking dynamic programming is the key. The state would keep track of how many digits each player has taken (Homer's moves `h_count` and Marge's moves `m_count`). This way, I can correctly compute the value of the digits. But this makes the calculation complex.\n\nMy latest thinking is to define `dp[h_taken][m_taken]` to store the maximum `S1 + S2` achievable, given that Homer has already taken `h_taken` digits, and Marge has taken `m_taken` digits. I am using memoization and a recursive structure. This is way better!\n\nThe recursive function `solve(h_taken, m_taken)` does the heavy lifting. It calculates the value of adding the next available digit to either Homer or Marge. I use a memo to avoid repeating calculations. I have a `score_X_contrib` that calculates the numerical contribution of a digit based on who takes it and how many digits that player already took.\n\nI'm also maintaining a `path_suffix` to store the moves (H or M). I calculate each contribution to `S1` and `S2` using the power of 10. The state stores the optimal `S1+S2` from this point onwards and the best path to reach it.\n\nI've been tracing the logic through several examples and debugging the calculation of how each digit contributes to `S1` and `S2`. It's pretty straightforward, but I have to be careful with the order of digits and the powers of 10. The base case is when both players have taken all their digits (or when the digits are exhausted).\n\nI think the current solution will work.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer (H) and Marge (M) such that both players make exactly `n` moves, and the total sum of their final numbers `S1 + S2` is maximized. They take digits from the left of a `2n`-digit number `A`.\n\nLet the digits of `A` be `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{2n-1}`.\nWhen a player takes a digit, say `a_k`, it becomes the next digit in their number. If Homer takes `a_k` and it's his `i`-th digit (0-indexed) taken, it will contribute `a_k * 10^(n-1-i)` to `S1`. Similarly for Marge.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.\nLet `solve(h_taken, m_taken)` be a function that returns the maximum possible sum `S1 + S2` from the remaining digits, given that Homer has already taken `h_taken` digits and Marge has already taken `m_taken` digits. It also returns the sequence of moves to achieve this maximum sum.\n\nThe state of our DP will be `(h_taken, m_taken)`:\n- `h_taken`: The number of digits Homer has already taken.\n- `m_taken`: The number of digits Marge has already taken.\n\nThe current digit being considered from `A` is `A[h_taken + m_taken]`.\n\n**Base Case:**\nIf `h_taken == n` and `m_taken == n`, it means all `2n` digits have been assigned. No more digits to take, so the additional sum is `0` and the path is an empty string. `return (0, \"\")`.\n\n**Recursive Step:**\nFor a given state `(h_taken, m_taken)`:\n1.  **Homer takes the current digit `A[k]`**:\n    This is possible only if `h_taken < n`.\n    Let `k = h_taken + m_taken`. The current digit is `digit_val = int(A[k])`.\n    If Homer takes this digit, it's his `h_taken`-th digit. Its contribution to `S1` (and thus to `S1 + S2`) will be `digit_val * 10^(n - 1 - h_taken)`.\n    We then recursively call `solve(h_taken + 1, m_taken)` to find the maximum sum and path for the rest of the game.\n    `score_if_H_takes = digit_val * (10**(n - 1 - h_taken)) + solve(h_taken + 1, m_taken)[0]`\n    `path_if_H_takes = \"H\" + solve(h_taken + 1, m_taken)[1]`\n\n2.  **Marge takes the current digit `A[k]`**:\n    This is possible only if `m_taken < n`.\n    Similarly, if Marge takes this digit, it's her `m_taken`-th digit. Its contribution to `S2` (and thus to `S1 + S2`) will be `digit_val * 10^(n - 1 - m_taken)`.\n    We then recursively call `solve(h_taken, m_taken + 1)`.\n    `score_if_M_takes = digit_val * (10**(n - 1 - m_taken)) + solve(h_taken, m_taken + 1)[0]`\n    `path_if_M_takes = \"M\" + solve(h_taken, m_taken + 1)[1]`\n\nWe compare `score_if_H_takes` and `score_if_M_takes`. We choose the option that yields a higher total sum. If the sums are equal, either choice is fine (the problem states \"output any of them\"). In our implementation, we'll prefer Homer's move if scores are equal.\n\n**Memoization:**\nWe use a dictionary `memo` to store the results of `solve(h_taken, m_taken)` to avoid redundant computations. The key will be `(h_taken, m_taken)` and the value will be `(max_score, path_suffix)`.\n\n**Initial Call:**\nThe game starts with `h_taken = 0` and `m_taken = 0`. So, we call `solve(0, 0)`. The second element of the returned tuple will be our desired sequence of moves.\n\n**Constraints:**\n`n` is up to 18. This means `h_taken` and `m_taken` can go from 0 to 18.\nThe DP table size is `(n+1) * (n+1)`, which is `19 * 19 = 361` states. Each state involves a few arithmetic operations and at most two recursive calls. This is efficient enough.\nThe maximum value of `S1` or `S2` can be roughly `9 * (10^17 + ... + 10^0)`, which is about `9 * (10^18 - 1) / 9 = 10^18 - 1`. The total sum `S1 + S2` can be up to `2 * (10^18 - 1)`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle this without overflow.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Memoization dictionary to store results of solve(h_taken, m_taken)\nmemo = {}\nA_str = \"\"\nN = 0\n\ndef solve(h_taken, m_taken):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum total prize (S1 + S2) and the corresponding\n    sequence of moves from the current state.\n\n    Args:\n        h_taken: Number of digits Homer has already taken.\n        m_taken: Number of digits Marge has already taken.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (max_score, path_suffix) where:\n        - max_score: The maximum possible sum of S1 + S2 from this state onwards.\n        - path_suffix: The sequence of 'H' and 'M' moves to achieve max_score.\n    \"\"\"\n    if (h_taken, m_taken) in memo:\n        return memo[(h_taken, m_taken)]\n\n    # k is the index of the current digit in A_str being considered\n    k = h_taken + m_taken\n\n    # Base case: All digits have been assigned\n    if h_taken == N and m_taken == N:\n        return (0, \"\")\n\n    current_digit_val = int(A_str[k])\n\n    res_H_score = -1\n    res_H_path = \"\"\n    if h_taken < N:\n        # Homer takes the current digit\n        # Its contribution to S1 is current_digit_val * 10^(N - 1 - h_taken)\n        # N - 1 - h_taken is the power of 10 for this digit (0-indexed from right)\n        h_contrib = current_digit_val * (10**(N - 1 - h_taken))\n        \n        # Recursively get the max score and path for the remaining game\n        next_score, next_path = solve(h_taken + 1, m_taken)\n        \n        res_H_score = h_contrib + next_score\n        res_H_path = \"H\" + next_path\n\n    res_M_score = -1\n    res_M_path = \"\"\n    if m_taken < N:\n        # Marge takes the current digit\n        # Its contribution to S2 is current_digit_val * 10^(N - 1 - m_taken)\n        m_contrib = current_digit_val * (10**(N - 1 - m_taken))\n        \n        # Recursively get the max score and path for the remaining game\n        next_score, next_path = solve(h_taken, m_taken + 1)\n        \n        res_M_score = m_contrib + next_score\n        res_M_path = \"M\" + next_path\n\n    # Compare the results and store the maximum\n    if res_H_score >= res_M_score: # Prefer Homer if scores are equal\n        memo[(h_taken, m_taken)] = (res_H_score, res_H_path)\n    else:\n        memo[(h_taken, m_taken)] = (res_M_score, res_M_path)\n\n    return memo[(h_taken, m_taken)]\n\ndef main():\n    global N, A_str\n\n    N = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Call the DP function starting from the initial state (0 Homer moves, 0 Marge moves)\n    max_total_prize, sequence_of_moves = solve(0, 0)\n\n    sys.stdout.write(sequence_of_moves + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```",
