Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

The sum S1 + S2 is the sum of\n    # (digit_i * 10^(n - pos_in_S1_or_S2_for_digit_i)).\n    # The crucial observation is that for any digit A[j], if it is taken by Homer\n    # as his k-th digit, it contributes A[j] * 10^(n-k) to S1.\n    # If it is taken by Marge as her k-th digit, it contributes A[j] * 10^(n-k) to S2.\n    # So, the contribution of A[j] to the total sum S1 + S2 is always A[j] * 10^(n-k)\n    # where k is the count of digits already taken by that specific player.\n\n    # This means that to maximize the total sum, for each k from 1 to n,\n    # we want the two digits that are assigned to the k-th position (one for S1, one for S2)\n    # to be as large as possible.\n    # The problem statement implies that we take digits from left to right from A.\n    # So, A[0] is the first digit available, A[1] is the second, and so on.\n\n    # Let's consider the digits A[0], A[1], ..., A[2n-1].\n    # We need to make 2n moves.\n    # The first digit taken by *any* player will be multiplied by 10^(n-1).\n    # The second digit taken by *any* player will be multiplied by 10^(n-1) if it's the first for that player,\n    # or 10^(n-2) if it's the second for that player.\n\n    # This is a greedy problem.
