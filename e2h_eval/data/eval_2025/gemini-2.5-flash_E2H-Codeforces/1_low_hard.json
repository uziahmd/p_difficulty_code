    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Gilded Cells**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate, given its width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of gilded rings (`k`).  The core of this problem lies in accurately calculating the number of border cells within each ring.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the rings are structured. The problem states that the *i*-th ring borders an inner rectangle with dimensions `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  Let's call these inner dimensions `w_i` and `h_i`.\n\nNow, calculating the number of cells in each ring hinges on determining the border cells of a rectangle with dimensions `w_i` and `h_i`. I initially considered the formula `2*W + 2*H - 4` for a rectangle of size `W x H`. However, I realized this doesn't handle edge cases gracefully, particularly when `W` or `H` is small (like 1 or 2).\n\nTherefore, I need a more robust calculation to ensure all cases are handled correctly. I've broken the border cell count into several cases:\n\n*   If either `w_i` or `h_i` is less than or equal to 0, there are no cells to count.\n*   If `w_i` and `h_i` are both 1, then there is only 1 border cell.\n*   If `w_i` is 1 and `h_i` is greater than 1, then the border count is equal to `h_i`.\n*   If `w_i` is greater than 1 and `h_i` is 1, then the border count is equal to `w_i`.\n*   If both `w_i` and `h_i` are greater than 1, then I can use `2*w_i + 2*h_i - 4` to determine the count.\n\nThe constraint provided for `k` is `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. This ensures that the inner rectangles have valid (positive) dimensions as we subtract. I should probably incorporate this check in my script for robustness, just to make sure I don't go out of bounds.\n\nNow, my Python script should iterate through each ring (from 1 to `k`), calculate the number of border cells in each ring using my refined formula, and accumulate a total count. Finally, it will return this total. I think I have a clear plan here. Let's get coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate has dimensions `w` (width) and `h` (height). There are `k` gilded rings.\n\nEach `i`-th ring (1-indexed) is defined by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nLet's denote the dimensions of the inner rectangle for the `i`-th ring as `current_w` and `current_h`.\nFor the first ring (`i=1`):\n`current_w = w - 4(1 - 1) = w`\n`current_h = h - 4(1 - 1) = h`\nSo, the first ring is the border of the original `w x h` plate.\n\nFor the second ring (`i=2`):\n`current_w = w - 4(2 - 1) = w - 4`\n`current_h = h - 4(2 - 1) = h - 4`\nSo, the second ring is the border of a `(w-4) x (h-4)` rectangle.\n\nAnd so on, for the `i`-th ring:\n`current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)`\n`current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)`\n\nThe number of cells in the border of a `W x H` rectangle (where `W, H >= 1`) can be calculated as `2*W + 2*H - 4`. This formula correctly counts the perimeter cells for any `W, H >= 2`.\n- If `W=1, H=1`, the formula gives `2*1 + 2*1 - 4 = 0`. The actual count is 1.\n- If `W=1, H>1`, the formula gives `2*1 + 2*H - 4 = 2H - 2`. The actual count is `H`.\n- If `W>1, H=1`, the formula gives `2*W + 2*1 - 4 = 2W - 2`. The actual count is `W`.\n\nA more generally applicable formula for `W, H >= 1` is `W * H - (W-2) * (H-2)`, where `(W-2)*(H-2)` is taken as 0 if `W-2 <= 0` or `H-2 <= 0`. This counts the total cells minus the inner cells.\nAlternatively, we can use conditional logic:\n- If `current_w <= 0` or `current_h <= 0`, there are no cells, so 0 gilded cells. (The problem constraints `k <= floor((min(n, m) + 1) / 4)` ensure that `current_w` and `current_h` will always be at least 1 for all `k` rings, so this case won't be hit).\n- If `current_w = 1` and `current_h = 1`, the count is 1.\n- If `current_w = 1` and `current_h > 1`, the count is `current_h`.\n- If `current_w > 1` and `current_h = 1`, the count is `current_w`.\n- If `current_w > 1` and `current_h > 1`, the count is `2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`.\n\nGiven the constraints `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(n, m) + 1) / 4)`, `current_w` and `current_h` will always be at least 1.\nLet's verify the minimum possible `current_w` and `current_h`:\nThe smallest `w, h` are 3. `min(3, 3) = 3`. `k_max = floor((3+1)/4) = floor(1) = 1`.\nFor `k=1`, `i=1`. `current_w = 3 - 4(0) = 3`, `current_h = 3 - 4(0) = 3`. Both are > 1.\nFor `w=7, h=9`, `min(7,9) = 7`. `k_max = floor((7+1)/4) = floor(2) = 2`.\nIf `k=1`, `i=1`. `current_w = 7`, `current_h = 9`. Both > 1.\nIf `k=2`, `i=2`. `current_w = 7 - 4(1) = 3`, `current_h = 9 - 4(1) = 5`. Both > 1.\n\nSince `w, h >= 3`, `w - 4(i-1)` and `h - 4(i-1)` will always be `>= 3 - 4(k-1)`.\nThe maximum value of `k-1` is `floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) - 1`.\nSo `4(k-1) <= 4 * ( (min(w,h)+1)/4 - 1 ) = min(w,h)+1-4 = min(w,h)-3`.\nThus, `w - 4(k-1) >= w - (min(w,h)-3)`.\nIf `w = min(w,h)`, then `w - (w-3) = 3`.\nIf `h = min(w,h)`, then `h - (h-3) = 3`.\nThis means `current_w` and `current_h` will always be at least 3 for all `k` rings.\nTherefore, the simplified formula `2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4` is always applicable for calculating the cells in each ring.\n\nThe total number of gilded cells is the sum of cells in each of the `k` rings.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `total_gilded_cells = 0`.\n2. Loop `i` from 1 to `k`:\n   a. Calculate `current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)`.\n   b. Calculate `current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)`.\n   c. Calculate cells for this ring: `ring_cells = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`.\n   d. Add `ring_cells` to `total_gilded_cells`.\n3. Print `total_gilded_cells`.\n\nExample 1: `w=3, h=3, k=1`\n- `i=1`:\n  `current_w = 3 - 4*(0) = 3`\n  `current_h = 3 - 4*(0) = 3`\n  `ring_cells = 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6 + 6 - 4 = 8`\n  `total_gilded_cells = 8`\nOutput: 8\n\nExample 2: `w=7, h=9, k=1`\n- `i=1`:\n  `current_w = 7 - 4*(0) = 7`\n  `current_h = 9 - 4*(0) = 9`\n  `ring_cells = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28`\n  `total_gilded_cells = 28`\nOutput: 28\n\nExample 3: `w=7, h=9, k=2`\n- `i=1`:\n  `current_w = 7 - 4*(0) = 7`\n  `current_h = 9 - 4*(0) = 9`\n  `ring_cells = 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14 + 18 - 4 = 28`\n  `total_gilded_cells = 28`\n- `i=2`:\n  `current_w = 7 - 4*(1) = 3`\n  `current_h = 9 - 4*(1) = 5`\n  `ring_cells = 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6 + 10 - 4 = 12`\n  `total_gilded_cells = 28 + 12 = 40`\nOutput: 40\n\nThe logic holds for all examples.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    w = int(line[0])\n    h = int(line[1])\n    k = int(line[2])\n\n    total_gilded_cells = 0\n\n    for i in range(k):\n        # Calculate dimensions for the current ring\n        # i is 0-indexed in loop, problem uses 1-indexed i-th ring\n        # so for the j-th ring (1-indexed), the offset is 4*(j-1)\n        # In our 0-indexed loop, this is 4*i\n        current_w = w - 4 * i\n        current_h = h - 4 * i\n\n        # Calculate cells for the current ring's border\n        # As established in thought process, current_w and current_h will always be >= 3\n        # so the formula 2*W + 2*H - 4 is always applicable.\n        ring_cells = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4\n        \n        total_gilded_cells += ring_cells\n    \n    print(total_gilded_cells)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
