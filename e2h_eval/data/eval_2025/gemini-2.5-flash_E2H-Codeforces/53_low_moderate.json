Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Longest Duplicate Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the longest substring that repeats within a given string. The input is a string of lowercase letters, and the length is constrained between 1 and 100. Overlapping occurrences are allowed, which is an important detail.\n\nMy approach is to start with the longest possible substring length, which is one less than the string's total length (because a substring can't be as long as the entire string). Then, I'll work my way down to shorter lengths until I find one that actually repeats. If no substring repeats, the answer is 0.\n\nTo check if a substring of a given length, let's say *L*, repeats, I need to look at every possible substring of that length.  For each potential substring, I'll need to compare it against the rest of the string to see if it appears again. Since overlapping is allowed, the comparison needs to consider all positions in the string. I'll use a nested loop structure here.  The outer loop will control the substring length L, decreasing from the maximum down to 1. The inner loops will handle finding all substring candidates and then checking for duplications.\n\nSpecifically, I'll iterate through all starting positions 'i' for substrings of length L. For each of these, I'll compare it to all subsequent substrings, starting from index 'i+1'. This prevents redundant comparisons and ensures I'm looking for *different* occurrences. If I find a match, that's my answer! Because the outer loop is iterating downward, the first length that works is the longest.\n\nIf I get through all lengths and still don't find a repeat, the function should return 0, indicating no repeating substrings were found. I've also done a quick mental check, and I think it would be helpful to work through an example \"ababa\" to make sure my logic is sound. It looks like with this strategy, I should be able to solve the problem efficiently!\n",
