    "thought": "**My thought process begins with the \"Gluttony\" problem, which involves constructing a permutation `b` of an array `a` such that no proper, non-empty subset of elements in `a` sums to the same value as the corresponding subset in `b`.** I'm immediately struck by the constraint on the array size, `n <= 22`, which hints at a potentially exponential solution space, but also allows for brute-force or clever subset enumeration.\n\nI start by analyzing small cases, `n=1` and `n=2`.  For `n=1`, the condition is trivially satisfied. For `n=2`, I realize the only possible permutation different from `a` is the reversed array `[a1, a0]`, and this works because the elements are distinct. This gives me confidence to analyze for `n=3`, trying to come up with a generalized rule.\n\nLooking at `n=3`, I try a cyclic shift, and it seems to work. This makes me try to prove it. I realize that the cyclic shift idea would lead to the condition that differences between consecutive elements in some subset sums up to 0, if the conditions are violated.  Then, I try to generalize this and prove it for general `n`. It feels like there is something missing here and there are multiple edge cases. I test a few samples to see if it really works.\n\nI now focus on examples from the problem statement, and try to find a pattern or any special strategy for this `b` array. However, I realize it is not a simple shift. So I am forced to come up with a new idea. I then decide to consider the sorted version of `a`.\n\nI now realize that if I sort `a`, and then assign each element of `b` the next element in sorted array, but back to the original index of an element in `a`, then it will lead to a valid `b`.\n\nI am now looking at the differences between each element of `a` and `b`. The difference between elements must not sum to zero for any subset. So I consider `c = a_i - b_i`, and look at subsets of `c`. I realize that these differences, if arranged in the given way, are always non zero.\n\nNow I decide to formalize the sorting approach: sort the values, find original positions and then build `b`. I also convince myself with a proof by contradiction: Assuming that sum is possible in a subset, then it leads to a contradiction, since each term cancels out each other. This must be the right approach.\n\nSo, I will sort `a`, find the original index, and map the array. And it should be correct.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements of `a` at these indices is different from the sum of elements of `b` at these indices. That is, `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]` for `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nLet's analyze the condition `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`. This is equivalent to `sum_{i in S} (a[i] - b[i]) != 0`. Let `c[i] = a[i] - b[i]`. We need `sum_{i in S} c[i] != 0` for all `0 < |S| < n`.\nSince `b` is a permutation of `a`, the sum of all elements in `a` is equal to the sum of all elements in `b`. Therefore, `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b[i]`, which implies `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c[i] = 0`. The problem statement explicitly excludes the subset containing all indices (`k < n`), so this total sum being zero is not a violation.\n\nConsider the following strategy:\n1. Create a list of pairs `(value, original_index)` for each element in `a`.\n2. Sort this list of pairs based on their `value` in ascending order. Let the sorted list be `[(s_0, p_0), (s_1, p_1), ..., (s_{n-1}, p_{n-1})]`, where `s_i` are the sorted values (`s_0 < s_1 < ... < s_{n-1}`) and `p_i` are their corresponding original indices in `a`.\n3. Construct the array `b` such that for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the element at `b[p_i]` (the original position of `s_i`) is `s_{(i+1) % n}` (the next element in the sorted sequence, wrapping around for the last element).\n   In other words, `b[p_0] = s_1`, `b[p_1] = s_2`, ..., `b[p_{n-1}] = s_0`.\n\nLet's prove why this construction works.\nFor each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, let `a[j]` be `s_k` for some `k`. Then `b[j]` is set to `s_{(k+1) % n}`.\nNow consider `c[j] = a[j] - b[j] = s_k - s_{(k+1) % n}`.\nThe values `c[j]` (when `a[j]` is `s_k`) are:\n- For `k = 0, ..., n-2`: `s_k - s_{k+1}`. Since `s_k < s_{k+1}`, these values are strictly negative.\n- For `k = n-1`: `s_{n-1} - s_0`. Since `s_{n-1} > s_0`, this value is strictly positive.\n\nNow, suppose for some `S` with `0 < |S| < n`, we have `sum_{j in S} c[j] = 0`.\nLet `I_S = {k \\mid a[j] = s_k \\text{ for some } j \\in S}`. This is the set of indices into the sorted array `s` corresponding to the elements `a[j]` for `j \\in S`.\nThe condition becomes `sum_{k \\in I_S} (s_k - s_{(k+1) % n}) = 0`.\n\nLet `d_k = s_k - s_{(k+1) % n}`.\nWe have `d_k < 0` for `k = 0, ..., n-2`, and `d_{n-1} > 0`.\nIf `n-1` is not in `I_S`, then all `d_k` for `k \\in I_S` are negative. Their sum would be strictly negative, not zero.\nTherefore, `n-1` must be in `I_S`.\n\nSo, `sum_{k \\in I_S} d_k = d_{n-1} + sum_{k \\in I_S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}} d_k = 0`.\nThis implies `(s_{n-1} - s_0) + sum_{k \\in I_S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}} (s_k - s_{k+1}) = 0`.\nRearranging, `s_{n-1} - s_0 = sum_{k \\in I_S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}} (s_{k+1} - s_k)`.\n\nWe know that `s_{n-1} - s_0 = (s_1 - s_0) + (s_2 - s_1) + ... + (s_{n-1} - s_{n-2}) = sum_{k=0}^{n-2} (s_{k+1} - s_k)`.\nLet `D_k = s_{k+1} - s_k`. Since all `s_k` are distinct and sorted, `D_k > 0` for all `k = 0, ..., n-2`.\nThe equation becomes `sum_{k=0}^{n-2} D_k = sum_{k \\in I_S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}} D_k`.\nSince all `D_k` are positive, this equality can only hold if the set of indices `I_S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}` is exactly `{0, 1, ..., n-2}`.\nIf `I_S \\setminus \\{n-1\\} = \\{0, 1, ..., n-2\\}`, then `I_S = \\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}`.\nThis means `|I_S| = n`.\nHowever, the problem requires `0 < |S| < n`, which implies `0 < |I_S| < n`.\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that `sum_{j in S} c[j] = 0` must be false.\n\nThus, `sum_{j in S} c[j] != 0` for all `0 < |S| < n`. This construction is always valid.\n\nExample: `n=4`, `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n1. Pairs `(value, original_index)`: `[(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`.\n2. Sorted pairs: `[(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`.\n   `s_0=1, p_0=3`\n   `s_1=10, p_1=2`\n   `s_2=100, p_2=1`\n   `s_3=1000, p_3=0`\n3. Construct `b`:\n   `b[p_0] = s_1`  => `b[3] = 10`\n   `b[p_1] = s_2`  => `b[2] = 100`\n   `b[p_2] = s_3`  => `b[1] = 1000`\n   `b[p_3] = s_0`  => `b[0] = 1`\n   Resulting `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`.\n\nThis solution is efficient enough as sorting takes `O(N log N)` time and constructing `b` takes `O(N)` time. `N <= 22` is very small.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Store pairs of (value, original_index)\n    indexed_a = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_a.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort based on values\n    indexed_a.sort()\n\n    # Create the result array b\n    b = [0] * n\n\n    # Apply the cyclic shift logic\n    # If a[original_idx] is indexed_a[i][0] (the i-th smallest value),\n    # then b[original_idx] should be indexed_a[(i+1)%n][0] (the next smallest value)\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_value = indexed_a[i][0]\n        original_index = indexed_a[i][1]\n        \n        next_value_in_sorted_list = indexed_a[(i + 1) % n][0]\n        \n        b[original_index] = next_value_in_sorted_list\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(*(b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
