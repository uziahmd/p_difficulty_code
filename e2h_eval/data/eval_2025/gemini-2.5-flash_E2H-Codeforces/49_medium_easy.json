They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this \"Mushroom Strife\" problem. My goal is to craft a Python script to solve it efficiently.**\n\nThe core of the issue is this: we've got a network of lawns (vertices) connected by roads (edges). Each road has information about the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the mushroom counts on the connected lawns. Our job is to find a set of mushroom counts for each lawn that fits all those GCD and LCM constraints. If such an assignment is impossible, we must report it.\n\nMy initial thought is that this structure screams \"graph problem.\" Since we're trying to find *any* valid solution, it suggests we should try a propagation-based approach—that is, figuring out values by using the constraints imposed by each edge on its connected nodes, kind of like those classic constraint satisfaction problems.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n*   **Relationship between GCD, LCM, and product:** The GCD and LCM of two numbers are deeply linked. We know the fundamental relationship: `gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b`. For an edge between lawns *u* and *v* with GCD *g* and LCM *l*, we know `x_u * x_v = g * l`, where `x_u` and `x_v` are the respective mushroom counts.\n*   **Divisibility implications:** The GCD constraint, `gcd(x_u, x_v) = g`, tells us that both `x_u` and `x_v` *must* be multiples of *g*.\n*   **Consistency is Crucial:** The LCM value also gives important constraints. if *l* is not divisible by *g* for any edge, there's no solution to be had.\n\n**Approach**\n\nBecause the constraint is on edges connecting nodes, the graph-based methodology looks like a good fit. We could try Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) or potentially a more advanced technique.\n\nThe approach I'll try will be using Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n\n*   **Initialization:** I'll start by checking if the LCM is divisible by the GCD. If not, I can just return \"NO\" right away. Otherwise, I will build an adjacency list and will proceed from there.\n*   **Value Assignment:** The BFS will begin with any unassigned node and tries assigning to it the LCM value of all the GCD for the incident edges. From that point, the count of each adjacent node can be inferred using `x_v = (g * l) // x_u`. If the calculations result in any constraint violation, I can return a \"NO\" message. If not, the algorithm will try to iterate through all the unassigned nodes by using the BFS until either all the values are found or the function fails and returns a \"NO\" message.\n\n**Caveats and Improvements:**\n\n*   **Prime Factorization:** I will likely need a prime factorization helper function.\n*   **Efficiency:** Prime factor finding could be a bit costly, so perhaps some optimizations are needed. The number of divisors could get large, so handling the candidate value list could get unwieldy.\n*   **Edge cases:** Careful handling of cases where the LCM is not divisible by the GCD, or initial values, are critical.\n\nLet's see if this BFS strategy gets me to a working solution!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to assign a positive integer number of mushrooms `x_i` to each lawn `i` such that for every given road between lawns `u` and `v` with specified GCD `g` and LCM `l`, the conditions `gcd(x_u, x_v) = g` and `lcm(x_u, x_v) = l` are met. We need to find any valid assignment or report that none exists. The mushroom counts must be between 1 and 10^6.\n\n**Key Properties:**\n1. For any two positive integers `a` and `b`, `gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b`.\n   Therefore, for an edge `(u, v)` with `g, l`, we must have `x_u * x_v = g * l`.\n2. `g` must divide `l`. If `l % g != 0` for any edge, no solution exists.\n3. If `x_u = g * a` and `x_v = g * b`, then `gcd(a, b) = 1` and `a * b = l / g`.\n   Let `P = l / g`. Then `a` and `b` must be coprime factors of `P`. This means that for any prime factor `p` of `P`, `p` can divide either `a` or `b` (to its full power in `P`), but not both. For example, if `P = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}`, then `a` must be of the form `\\prod_{j \\in S} p_j^{e_j}` for some subset `S` of `{1, \\dots, k}`, and `b` will be `\\prod_{j \\notin S} p_j^{e_j}`.\n\n**Algorithm Idea:**\nThis problem can be modeled as finding values for variables in a graph. Since we need to find *any* solution, a graph traversal (BFS or DFS) combined with constraint propagation is a suitable approach.\n\n1.  **Preprocessing and Initial Checks:**\n    *   For each edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n        *   Check if `l % g != 0`. If not, print \"NO\" and exit.\n        *   Store the edges in an adjacency list `adj`. For `adj[u]`, store `(v, g, l)`.\n        *   Precompute prime factors for all `P = l/g` values up to `10^6`. This will be useful for generating coprime factor pairs.\n\n2.  **Assigning Values using BFS/DFS:**\n    *   Initialize `ans[i] = 0` for all lawns `i` (meaning `x_i` is unassigned).\n    *   Initialize `fixed[i] = False` for all lawns `i`.\n    *   Iterate through each lawn `i` from `1` to `n`:\n        *   If `ans[i]` is already assigned (`fixed[i]` is True), skip.\n        *   Otherwise, we need to start a new component traversal.\n            *   **Determine initial candidates for `x_i`:** For a node `i`, `x_i` must be a multiple of `g_k` for all incident edges `(i, j_k, g_k, l_k)`, and a divisor of `l_k` for all incident edges.\n                *   Let `L_i = lcm` of all `g_k` for edges incident to `i`.\n                *   Let `G_i = gcd` of all `l_k` for edges incident to `i`.\n                *   If `i` has no edges, `x_i = 1` is a valid choice.\n                *   If `i` has edges, `x_i` must be of the form `L_i * k` where `k` is a divisor of `G_i / L_i`. If `G_i % L_i != 0`, no solution exists.\n                *   The values `L_i * k` must also be within `[1, 10^6]`.\n            *   **Trial Assignment:** Instead of trying all divisors `k`, we can leverage the property `x_u = g * a` and `x_v = g * b` where `a * b = l/g` and `gcd(a, b) = 1`.\n                For the first edge `(i, j, g_0, l_0)` incident to `i`:\n                `x_i` must be `g_0 * a` where `a` is a coprime factor of `P_0 = l_0/g_0`.\n                The smallest possible `a` is `1`, leading to `x_i = g_0`.\n                The largest possible `a` is `P_0`, leading to `x_i = g_0 * P_0 = l_0`.\n                These two choices (`g_0` and `l_0`) are often good starting points. If one fails, try the other.\n                A more robust strategy (as used in the provided solution) is to pick one of the two \"extreme\" values for `a`:\n                Let `P = l/g`. `P` can be factored into `p_1^{e_1} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}`.\n                One choice for `a` is `1`, meaning `x_u = g`.\n                Another choice for `a` is `P`, meaning `x_u = g * P = l`.\n                The other choice for `a` is `1`, meaning `x_v = g`.\n                Another choice for `a` is `P`, meaning `x_v = g * P = l`.\n                This gives us two initial pairs `(x_u, x_v)`: `(g, l)` and `(l, g)`.\n                We can try assigning `x_i = g_0` (if `i` has edges) or `x_i = 1` (if `i` has no edges). If this fails, the component is invalid.\n                The provided solution uses a more specific strategy:\n                If `i` has no edges, `ans[i] = 1`.\n                If `i` has edges, for the first edge `(i, j, g_k, l_k)` in its adjacency list, it tries `ans[i] = g_k`.\n                If this initial assignment leads to a contradiction, it tries `ans[i] = l_k`.\n                If both fail, then it reports \"NO\".\n\n            *   **BFS Traversal:**\n                *   Add `i` to a queue `q`. Mark `fixed[i] = True`.\n                *   While `q` is not empty:\n                    *   Dequeue `u`.\n                    *   For each neighbor `v` of `u` with edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n                        *   If `v` is not `fixed`:\n                            *   Calculate `x_v_candidate = (g * l) // ans[u]`.\n                            *   **Validation:**\n                                *   If `(g * l) % ans[u] != 0` (meaning `ans[u]` does not divide `g * l`), this path is invalid.\n                                *   If `x_v_candidate < 1` or `x_v_candidate > 10^6`, invalid.\n                                *   If `gcd(ans[u], x_v_candidate) != g`, invalid.\n                                *   If `lcm(ans[u], x_v_candidate) != l`, invalid.\n                                *   If any validation fails, the current choice for `ans[i]` (the component's starting node) is wrong. This means we need to backtrack and try the other initial choice for `ans[i]`.\n                            *   If valid, assign `ans[v] = x_v_candidate`, mark `fixed[v] = True`, and enqueue `v`.\n                        *   Else (`v` is already fixed):\n                            *   **Consistency Check:** Verify `gcd(ans[u], ans[v]) == g` and `lcm(ans[u], ans[v]) == l`. If not, the current choice for `ans[i]` is wrong. Backtrack.\n\n3.  **Backtracking for Initial Choices:**\n    To handle the \"try two choices\" strategy, we can encapsulate the BFS logic into a function `try_assign(start_node, initial_value)`. This function would return `True` if a valid assignment is found for the component, and `False` otherwise. If `try_assign` returns `False`, the main loop can try the alternative initial value for `start_node`. If both fail, then it's a \"NO\".\n    To implement backtracking, the `ans` and `fixed` arrays need to be reset to their state before the failed `try_assign` call. This can be done by copying the state or by recording changes and reverting them.\n\n**Detailed Two-Choice Strategy (as implemented):**\nFor each unvisited node `i`:\n1.  If `adj[i]` is empty, set `ans[i] = 1`, `fixed[i] = True`. Continue to next `i`.\n2.  Otherwise, for the first edge `(i, j, g_0, l_0)` in `adj[i]`:\n    *   **Attempt 1:** Try `initial_val = g_0`.\n        *   Call `run_bfs(i, initial_val)`. This function attempts to assign `ans[i] = initial_val` and propagate.\n        *   If `run_bfs` returns `True`, the component is solved. Continue to next `i`.\n    *   **Attempt 2 (if Attempt 1 failed):** Reset `ans` and `fixed` for the current component to their state before `run_bfs`. Try `initial_val = l_0`.\n        *   Call `run_bfs(i, initial_val)`.\n        *   If `run_bfs` returns `True`, the component is solved. Continue to next `i`.\n    *   **If both attempts failed:** No solution for this component. Print \"NO\" and exit.\n\nThe `run_bfs` function:\n*   Takes `start_node` and `initial_value` as input.\n*   Initializes a temporary `ans_comp` and `fixed_comp` for the current component (or uses global ones and records changes).\n*   Sets `ans_comp[start_node] = initial_value`, `fixed_comp[start_node] = True`.\n*   Performs BFS.\n*   During BFS, if any validation or consistency check fails, it immediately returns `False`.\n*   If BFS completes without failure, it means a valid assignment for the component is found. It applies the `ans_comp` values to the global `ans` array and returns `True`.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   `m = 0`: All `x_i = 1` is a valid solution.\n*   Disconnected graph: The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1)` handles this by starting a new BFS for each unvisited component.\n*   `x_i` values must be within `[1, 10^6]`. This is checked during validation.\n*   `g * l` can be up to `10^12`, which fits in standard 64-bit integers. Python handles large integers automatically.\n\n**Example 3 Walkthrough with two-choice strategy:**\n`n=3, m=2`\n`3 2 1 2`\n`3 1 1 10`\n`adj[1] = [(3,1,1,10)]`\n`adj[2] = [(3,1,1,2)]`\n`adj[3] = [(2,1,1,2), (1,1,1,10)]`\n`ans = [0,0,0,0]`, `fixed = [F,F,F,F]`\n\n`i = 1`: `ans[1] == 0`. `adj[1]` is `[(3,1,1,10)]`.

Skip.\n`i = 3`: `fixed[3]` is True. Skip.\n\nAll nodes processed. Print \"YES\", then `10 2 1`. This is a valid solution. The example output is `5 1 2`. Both are valid. My solution found `(10, 2, 1)` which is equivalent to `(5*2, 1*2, 1*2)` if we chose `x_1=5` then `x_3=2` then `x_2=1`. The difference comes from the arbitrary choice of which factor `a` gets the `2` from `P=10`.\nMy strategy: `x_1 = g_0 * a` where `a` is `1` or `P_0`.\nExample output strategy: `x_1 = g_0 * a` where `a` is `P_0 / 2` (if `P_0` is even).\n\nThe key insight for the `(g_0, l_0)` choice is that `x_u = g_0 * a` and `x_v = g_0 * b` where `a*b = l_0/g_0` and `gcd(a,b)=1`.\nThe specific choices of `a=1` or `a=l_0/g_0` are the \"extreme\" valid coprime factors.\n`a=1` leads to `x_u = g_0`.\n`a=l_0/g_0` leads to `x_u = g_0 * (l_0/g_0) = l_0`.\nThese two choices are sufficient to find *a* solution if one exists, because any other valid `x_u` (say `g_0 * a'`) would make `x_v = g_0 * (l_0/g_0)/a'`. If `g_0 * a'` is a valid starting point, then `g_0 * (l_0/g_0)/a'` would also be a valid starting point for `x_v` on the same edge. The problem effectively has a \"duality\" in choices for `x_u` and `x_v` across an edge.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Function to calculate GCD (greatest common divisor)\n# Python's math.gcd is efficient\n# def gcd(a, b):\n#     while b:\n#         a, b = b, a % b\n#     return a\n\n# Function to calculate LCM (least common multiple)\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        return 0\n    return (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n# Global variables for graph and results\nn_nodes = 0\nadj = []\nans = []\nfixed = []\ncomponent_nodes = [] #
