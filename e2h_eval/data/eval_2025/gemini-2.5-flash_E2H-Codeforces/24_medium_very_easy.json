She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my thought process on solving this competitive programming problem:**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the task: minimize the time to close tabs outside a range [l, r]. My \"cursor\" can move left/right and close tabs to the left or right of the cursor. Each action takes one second.\n\nI start by analyzing edge cases: If all tabs are needed (l=1, r=n), the answer is zero. If only tabs to the right of 'r' need to be closed (l=1, r<n), I need to move to r and close tabs. Similarly, if only tabs left of 'l' need to be closed (l>1, r=n).\n\nThe core complexity arises when both sides need closing. I devise two strategies:\n\n1.  **Close Left First:** Move to 'l', close tabs left of 'l', traverse to 'r', then close tabs to the right of 'r'.\n2.  **Close Right First:** Move to 'r', close tabs right of 'r', traverse to 'l', then close tabs left of 'l'.\n\nThe cost of each strategy is the movement time + closing time. The movement cost is the absolute difference in positions, while closing always takes one second. The traversal between l and r adds to the total cost.\n\nI simplify the calculations, realizing the time to traverse between 'l' and 'r' is common in both strategies. It's essentially moving in a straight line after an end operation.\n\nI examine several example cases, including edge conditions, like pos being at l or r, or l and r being very close to verify that the logic is correct.\n\nAfter reviewing, I write the code in Python and implement the decision logic using conditional statements (if-else). I use the minimum of the two strategies' costs for all scenarios. The code prioritizes clarity. After validating the example inputs, I am confident that it works correctly and I submit.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum time to close all tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`. We start with `n` tabs, the cursor at `pos`, and want to keep tabs `l` through `r` open.\n\nThere are four types of operations, each taking 1 second:\n1.  Move cursor left.\n2.  Move cursor right.\n3.  Close all tabs to the left of the cursor.\n4.  Close all tabs to the right of the cursor.\n\nLet's analyze the different scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1: `l == 1` and `r == n`**\nIn this case, all tabs from 1 to `n` are required. No tabs need to be closed.\nThe minimum time is `0`.\n\n**Scenario 2: `l == 1` and `r < n`**\nWe need to close all tabs to the right of `r` (i.e., `[r+1, n]`). The tabs `[1, l-1]` do not exist since `l=1`.\nTo close tabs `[r+1, n]`, the cursor must be at or to the left of `r`. The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `r` and then perform the \"close right\" operation.\n-   Time to move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n-   Time to close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second.\nTotal time = `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**Scenario 3: `l > 1` and `r == n`**\nWe need to close all tabs to the left of `l` (i.e., `[1, l-1]`). The tabs `[r+1, n]` do not exist since `r=n`.\nTo close tabs `[1, l-1]`, the cursor must be at or to the right of `l`. The most efficient way is to move the cursor to `l` and then perform the \"close left\" operation.\n-   Time to move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n-   Time to close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second.\nTotal time = `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n**Scenario 4: `l > 1` and `r < n`**\nWe need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` AND `[r+1, n]`. This requires two closing operations, each costing 1 second.\nThere are two main strategies:\n\n*   **Strategy A: Close the left side first, then the right side.**\n    1.  Move the cursor from its current `pos` to `l`. This takes `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. This takes `1` second. After this, the minimum unclosed tab index `a` becomes `l`. The cursor is at `l`.\n    3.  Move the cursor from `l` to `r`. This takes `r - l` seconds (since `l <= r`). The cursor moves within the currently unclosed range `[l, n]`.\n    4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. This takes `1` second. After this, the maximum unclosed tab index `b` becomes `r`. The cursor is at `r`.\n    Total time for Strategy A: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\n*   **Strategy B: Close the right side first, then the left side.**\n    1.  Move the cursor from its current `pos` to `r`. This takes `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. This takes `1` second. After this, the maximum unclosed tab index `b` becomes `r`. The cursor is at `r`.\n    3.  Move the cursor from `r` to `l`. This takes `r - l` seconds (since `l <= r`). The cursor moves within the currently unclosed range `[1, r]`.\n    4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. This takes `1` second. After this, the minimum unclosed tab index `a` becomes `l`. The cursor is at `l`.\n    Total time for Strategy B: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nThe minimum time for Scenario 4 is `min(cost_Strategy_A, cost_Strategy_B)`.\n\nThe movement operations `max(i-1, a)` and `min(i+1, b)` ensure the cursor stays within the currently unclosed tabs. The calculations above correctly account for this because:\n-   Initially, `a=1` and `b=n`, so the cursor can move freely across all tabs.\n-   When closing the left side (`[1, l-1]`), `a` becomes `l`. Moving from `l` to `r` (rightward) is still possible as `r <= n`, so `min(curr_pos+1, b)` won't restrict movement within `[l, n]`.\n-   When closing the right side (`[r+1, n]`), `b` becomes `r`. Moving from `r` to `l` (leftward) is still possible as `l >= 1`, so `max(curr_pos-1, a)` won't restrict movement within `[1, r]`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, pos, l, r from a single line of input\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Case 1: All tabs from 1 to n are needed.
