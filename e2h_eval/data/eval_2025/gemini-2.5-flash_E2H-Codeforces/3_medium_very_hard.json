Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Solution for Vanya and Lanterns**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem about lanterns lighting up a street.  The goal is to figure out the *smallest* distance each lantern needs to cover so the whole street is lit. The input gives me the street's length, the number of lanterns, and their locations.  I need to find the minimal radius, 'd'.\n\nMy initial thought is that sorting the lantern positions is going to be key.  It just makes it easier to work through the logic. Then, I realized there are a few critical points to consider:\n\n1.  **The street's beginning and end:** The first lantern must reach point 0, and the last must reach the end, 'l'.\n2.  **Gaps between lanterns:**  If I have two lanterns next to each other, there might be gaps.  To cover the gap, 'd' has to be at least half the distance between them.\n\nSo, I'm thinking I'll sort the lanterns.  The 'd' I need is the *maximum* of these requirements:\n\n*   The distance from the first lantern to 0 (which is simply the position of the first lantern).\n*   The distance from the last lantern to 'l' (which is 'l' minus the position of the last lantern).\n*   Half the distance between *every* pair of adjacent lanterns.\n\nI'll iterate through the sorted list, calculate these 'd' values, and keep track of the biggest one.  That's my answer! The problem wants the answer with high precision, so I'll make sure to output it as a floating-point number. I need to handle some edge cases too, like when there's only one lantern, or when lanterns are at the street ends or on top of each other.  I've checked it and the logic is sound. This solution seems efficient enough and I'm ready to write the code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` such that `n` lanterns, located at points `a_i` on a street of length `l` (from `0` to `l`), can illuminate the entire street. Each lantern at `a_i` with radius `d` lights the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nTo find the minimum `d` that lights the entire street `[0, l]`, we need to consider three types of \"gaps\" or unlit regions that `d` must cover:\n\n1.  **The beginning of the street (point 0):** The first point `0` must be lit. This means the leftmost lantern `a_0` (after sorting the lantern positions) must extend its light to cover `0`. So, `a_0 - d <= 0`, which implies `d >= a_0`. The minimum `d` required for this is `a_0`.\n\n2.  **The end of the street (point l):** The last point `l` must be lit. This means the rightmost lantern `a_{n-1}` (after sorting) must extend its light to cover `l`. So, `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, which implies `d >= l - a_{n-1}`. The minimum `d` required for this is `l - a_{n-1}`.\n\n3.  **Gaps between adjacent lanterns:** For any two adjacent lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` (after sorting), the segment `(a_i, a_{i+1})` must be fully lit. This means the light from `a_i` must meet or overlap with the light from `a_{i+1}`. In other words, `a_i + d` must be greater than or equal to `a_{i+1} - d`. This simplifies to `2 * d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. We need to find the maximum of these `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` values across all adjacent pairs.\n\nThe minimum `d` required to light the entire street is the maximum of all these individual requirements.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read the number of lanterns `n` and the street length `l`.\n2.  Read the list of lantern positions `a_i`.\n3.  Sort the lantern positions `a` in ascending order.\n4.  Initialize `max_required_d = 0.0`. This variable will store the maximum `d` found so far.\n5.  **Calculate `d` for the street's start:** `max_required_d = max(max_required_d, float(a[0]))`.\n6.  **Calculate `d` for the street's end:** `max_required_d = max(max_required_d, float(l - a[n-1]))`.\n7.  **Calculate `d` for gaps between lanterns:** Iterate from `i = 0` to `n-2`:\n    *   Calculate `gap_d = (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2.0`.\n    *   Update `max_required_d = max(max_required_d, gap_d)`.\n8.  Print `max_required_d` formatted to 10 decimal places.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Second Sample):**\n`n=2, l=5`, `a = [2, 5]`\n\n1.  Sorted `a` is `[2, 5]`.\n2.  `max_required_d = 0.0`.\n3.  **Street start:** `a[0] = 2`. `max_required_d = max(0.0, 2.0) = 2.0`.\n4.  **Street end:** `l - a[n-1] = 5 - 5 = 0`. `max_required_d = max(2.0, 0.0) = 2.0`.\n5.  **Gaps:**\n    *   For `i=0`: `a[0]=2, a[1]=5`. `gap_d = (5 - 2) / 2.0 = 3 / 2.0 = 1.5`.\n    *   `max_required_d = max(2.0, 1.5) = 2.0`.\n6.  Final `max_required_d = 2.0`.\n\nThis approach ensures all critical unlit segments are covered with the minimum possible radius `d`. The time complexity is dominated by sorting, `O(N log N)`, which is efficient for `N <= 1000`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and l from the first line of input\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read the lantern positions from the second line of input\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the lantern positions.
