She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nMy initial thought process involved a comprehensive analysis of the competitive programming problem, which asks for the minimum time to close tabs outside a given range `[l, r]`. I carefully dissected the problem into its core operations: moving the cursor left or right, and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor. The crucial constraint is that closing tabs requires the cursor to be at a specific tab index (or one of the adjacent tabs to achieve the \"close\" effectively).  I recognized that the efficiency hinges on minimizing the cursor movements.\n\nMy key insight was to break the problem into manageable scenarios, dependent on the relationship between `l`, `r`, and the initial cursor position (`pos`). The simplest cases were where either `l=1` or `r=n`, where only one side needed closing. In those situations, the cost becomes the distance to the closer endpoint of the target range, plus 1 for the closing operation.\n\nWhen both `l > 1` and `r < n`, the solution requires two closing operations, so the minimum cost is at least 2. Here, I developed a strategy of carefully analyzing all cursor movements.  There were several cases: if `pos` is outside `[l,r]`, then it needs to go to a boundary (`l` or `r`) and then traverse to the other boundary. If `pos` is inside `[l,r]`, the key to minimizing cost is to traverse toward the closer endpoint of the closed range. It's essentially the same logic applied to smaller closed ranges.\n\nThe general approach is to move the cursor to the \"edges\" of the range to be closed and incur a unit cost for each \"close\" action. The minimal cost is thus a measure of the sum of these cursor movements and closing actions.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. We start with `n` tabs, cursor at `pos`. Each second, we can move the cursor left/right by one tab, or close all tabs to the left/right of the cursor.\n\nLet's analyze the different scenarios:\n\n1.  **All tabs are to be kept (`l = 1` and `r = n`):**\n    If the desired range `[l, r]` is `[1, n]`, then no tabs need to be closed.\n    The cost is `0`.\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the right need to be closed (`l = 1` and `r < n`):**\n    In this case, tabs `[1, l-1]` are empty (since `l=1`), so only tabs `[r+1, n]` need to be closed.\n    To close tabs to the right of `r`, the cursor must be at `r` (or any tab to its left) and perform the \"close right\" operation. The most efficient way is to move the cursor directly to `r` and then close.\n    -   Time to move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    -   Time to close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second.\n    -   Total cost: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the left need to be closed (`r = n` and `l > 1`):**\n    In this case, tabs `[r+1, n]` are empty (since `r=n`), so only tabs `[1, l-1]` need to be closed.\n    To close tabs to the left of `l`, the cursor must be at `l` (or any tab to its right) and perform the \"close left\" operation. The most efficient way is to move the cursor directly to `l` and then close.\n    -   Time to move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    -   Time to close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second.\n    -   Total cost: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Tabs on both sides need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r < n`):**\n    We need to close `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This will always require two \"close\" operations, costing at least 2 seconds. The cursor needs to visit both `l` and `r` (or positions adjacent to them) to perform these operations.\n    The total path for the cursor will involve moving from `pos` to one end (`l` or `r`), then moving to the other end.\n\n    *   **Subcase 4.1: `pos` is to the left of `l` (`pos < l`):**\n        The cursor is at `pos`. It must first move right to `l` to close the left segment, then continue right to `r` to close the right segment.\n        -   Move `pos` to `l`: `l - pos` seconds.\n        -   Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second.\n        -   Move `l` to `r`: `r - l` seconds.\n        -   Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second.\n        -   Total cost: `(l - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = r - pos + 2`.\n\n    *   **Subcase 4.2: `pos` is to the right of `r` (`pos > r`):**\n        The cursor is at `pos`. It must first move left to `r` to close the right segment, then continue left to `l` to close the left segment.\n        -   Move `pos` to `r`: `pos - r` seconds.\n        -   Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second.\n        -   Move `r` to `l`: `r - l` seconds.\n        -   Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second.\n        -   Total cost: `(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = pos - l + 2`.\n\n    *   **Subcase 4.3: `pos` is within `[l, r]` (`l <= pos <= r`):**\n        The cursor is already inside the target range. It can either go left first or right first.\n        -   **Option A: Go left first (pos -> l -> r):**\n            -   Move `pos` to `l`: `pos - l` seconds.\n            -   Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second.\n            -   Move `l` to `r`: `r - l` seconds.\n            -   Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second.\n            -   Total cost: `(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n        -   **Option B: Go right first (pos -> r -> l):**\n            -   Move `pos` to `r`: `r - pos` seconds.\n            -   Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second.\n            -   Move `r` to `l`: `r - l` seconds.\n            -   Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second.\n            -   Total cost: `(r - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1`.\n        We choose the minimum of these two options. Notice that `(r-l) + 2` is common to both. So we minimize `(pos-l)` and `(r-pos)`.\n        -   Total cost: `min(pos - l, r - pos) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nThe solution combines these conditions to find the minimum time.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    cost = 0\n\n    # Case 1: All tabs are to be kept.\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        cost = 0\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the right need to be closed (l is already 1).\n    elif l == 1:\n        cost = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the left need to be closed (r is already n).\n    elif r == n:\n        cost = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    # Case 4: Tabs on both sides need to be closed.\n    else:\n        # Subcase 4.1: Cursor is to the left of the desired range [l, r].\n        if pos < l:\n            # Move pos -> l (cost l-pos), close left (cost 1)\n            # Then move l -> r (cost r-l), close right (cost 1)\n            cost = (l - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n        # Subcase 4.2: Cursor is to the right of the desired range [l, r].\n        elif pos > r:\n            # Move pos -> r (cost pos-r), close right (cost 1)\n            # Then move r -> l (cost r-l), close left (cost 1)\n            cost = (pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n        # Subcase 4.3: Cursor is within the desired range [l, r].\n        else: # l <= pos <= r\n            # Option A: Go left first (pos -> l -> r)\n            cost_left_first = (pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n            # Option B: Go right first (pos -> r -> l)\n            cost_right_first = (r - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n            cost = min(cost_left_first, cost_right_first)\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(str(cost) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
