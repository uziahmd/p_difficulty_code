Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing and Reassembling a Ternary String for Lexicographical Minimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this ternary string problem. The core of it seems to be understanding the implications of these specific swaps. We can switch '0' and '1', and '1' and '2', but never '0' and '2'. This immediately tells me that the relative order of '0's and '2's is immutable – it's locked in place. If I see a \"0...2\" sequence, that's *always* going to be \"0...2\" in the final result.\n\nThe '1's are the key here. They're the flexible elements, capable of moving past both '0's and '2's. So, to get the lexicographically smallest string, my instinct tells me I want to clump all the '0's together at the beginning, then the '1's, and finally the '2's. This is the optimal ordering for any string, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI'm thinking I can extract the '0's and '2's from the original string to form a subsequence, let's call it `s_02`. This subsequence will hold the absolute, unchangeable positions for those characters. From that, I will place the '1's, strategically. Since the swaps don't impact the relative order of the '0's and '2's, I know I just need to figure out where to insert the '1's. The constraint here is that '0's can't pass '2's.\n\nI can make this even easier if I separate the '0's and '2's and think about where to insert the '1's. All I need to do is arrange the '0's and '2's in their original order. Then, I can count the number of '1's and insert them after the '0's and before the '2's. That approach will keep the string lexicographically minimal.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by repeatedly swapping adjacent '0' and '1' characters, or adjacent '1' and '2' characters. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' <-> '1': A '0' can move past a '1', and vice versa.\n2. '1' <-> '2': A '1' can move past a '2', and vice versa.\n\nCrucially, '0' <-> '2' is NOT allowed. This means that if we have a '0' at index `i` and a '2' at index `j` in the original string, their relative order cannot change. If `i < j`, the '0' will always appear before the '2'. If `i > j`, the '2' will always appear before the '0'.\n\nThis observation is key: the relative order of all '0's and '2's is fixed.\nFor example, in \"010210\":\nThe '0's and '2's are \"0_02_0\". Their relative order will always be \"0020\".\nThe '1's, however, can move freely past '0's and '2's. This means all '1's can be grouped together and placed anywhere relative to the '0's and '2's.\n\nTo make a string lexicographically smallest, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by '1's, then '2's.\n\nConsider the string formed by only '0's and '2's, maintaining their original relative order. Let's call this `s_02`.\nFor \"100210\", `s_02` would be \"0020\".\nAll '1's can be moved past any '0' or '2'. This means all '1's can be collected and placed at any single contiguous block within `s_02`.\n\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. We want to put all '0's first.\n2. Then, we want to put all '1's.\n3. Then, we want to put all '2's.\n\nSince '0's and '2's cannot cross each other, we cannot simply sort the entire string. However, '1's can cross both '0's and '2's. This means all '1's can be moved together to any position.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to:\n1. Collect all '0's.\n2. Collect all '1's.\n3. Collect all '2's.\n\nNow, construct the result string:\n- Append all '0's that appear *before the first '2'* in the original string.\n- Then, append all '1's from the original string.\n- Then, append all '0's that appear *after the first '2'* in the original string (these '0's cannot move past the '2's that came before them).\n- Finally, append all '2's from the original string.\n\nLet's refine this. The '1's can move past '0's and '2's. This means all '1's can be grouped together. Where should this group of '1's be placed?\nTo minimize the string lexicographically, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nThe '0's that appear before any '2' can be moved to the very beginning.\nThe '2's will naturally appear after these '0's.\nThe '0's that appear after some '2' cannot move past that '2'.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n1. Iterate through the input string `s`.\n2. Count the total number of '1's. Let this be `count_1`.\n3. Construct a new string `res` by iterating through `s` again.\n   - If `s[i]` is '0', append '0' to `res`.\n   - If `s[i]` is '2', append '2' to `res`.\n   - If `s[i]` is '1', do nothing (we will insert all '1's later).\n4. Now, `res` contains all '0's and '2's in their original relative order. We need to insert `count_1` '1's into `res`. To make the string lexicographically smallest, these '1's should be inserted *after all initial '0's* and *before any '2's*.\n   - Find the first occurrence of '2' in `res`.\n   - If '2' is not found (i.e., `res` contains only '0's), append all `count_1` '1's to the end of `res`.\n   - If '2' is found at index `idx_2`, insert all `count_1` '1's at `idx_2`. This means `res` becomes `res[0...idx_2-1]` + (all '1's) + `res[idx_2...]`.\n\nExample 1: \"100210\"\n1. `count_1 = 2` (from '1' at index 0 and '1' at index 4).\n2. `res` (containing only '0's and '2's): \"0020\".\n3. Find first '2' in \"0020\". It's at index 2.\n4. Insert two '1's at index 2: \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\".\n\nExample 2: \"11222121\"\n1. `count_1 = 4` (from '1's at indices 0, 1, 5, 7).\n2. `res` (containing only '0's and '2's): \"2222\". (No '0's)\n3. Find first '2' in \"2222\". It's at index 0.\n4. Insert four '1's at index 0: \"\" + \"1111\" + \"2222\" = \"11112222\".\n\nExample 3: \"20\"\n1. `count_1 = 0`.\n2. `res` (containing only '0's and '2's): \"20\".\n3. Find first '2' in \"20\". It's at index 0.\n4. Insert zero '1's at index 0: \"\" + \"\" + \"20\" = \"20\".\n\nThis logic correctly handles all cases. The '0's that appear before any '2' in `s_02` will be at the beginning. The '1's will be placed immediately after them. Any '2's will follow, and any '0's that originally appeared after a '2' will follow those '2's. This is the lexicographically smallest arrangement possible given the constraints.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Counting '1's can be done with `s.count('1')`.\n- Filtering '0's and '2's can be done by joining characters that are not '1'.\n- Finding the first '2' can be done with `s_02.find('2')`.\n- String manipulation can be done by slicing and concatenation or by building a list of characters and then joining.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_ones = 0\n    s_without_ones_list = []\n\n    # First pass: count ones and build a list of zeros and twos\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count_ones += 1\n        else:\n            s_without_ones_list.append(char)\n    \n    # Convert the list of zeros and twos back to a string\n    s_without_ones = \"\".join(s_without_ones_list)\n\n    # Find the insertion point for ones\n    # Ones should be placed after all initial zeros and before any twos\n    first_two_index = -1\n    for i in range(len(s_without_ones)):\n        if s_without_ones[i] == '2':\n            first_two_index = i\n            break\n    \n    result_list = []\n    if first_two_index == -1:\n        # No '2's in the string, all '0's followed by all '1's\n        result_list.append(s_without_ones)\n        result_list.append('1' * count_ones)\n    else:\n        # '2's exist.
