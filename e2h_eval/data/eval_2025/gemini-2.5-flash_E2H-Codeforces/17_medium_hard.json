He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thought process for tackling this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem.**\n\nFirst, I had to deeply understand the problem. I realized we're given some length `n` and `2n-2` strings – a mix of prefixes and suffixes of a hidden string `s`. The tricky part is figuring out which is which and reconstructing a valid `s`. The constraint of having *exactly two* strings for each length (from 1 to `n-1`) was a major clue. It means we have a complete set of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nMy initial instinct was to focus on the strings of length `n-1`. They're the longest and must share a lot in common with the actual `s`. I figured one would be the prefix of length `n-1`, the other the suffix.  This led to two possible scenarios to build `s`.\n\nI quickly realized I needed a way to test if an `s` I constructed was *actually* valid, given the input. So, I figured, generate all the prefixes and suffixes for my candidate `s`. Then, I'd try to \"match\" them with the given strings. The \"exactly two strings per length\" constraint means there's a unique assignment for each. This hinted at a greedy approach – assign 'P' (prefix) whenever possible, otherwise assign 'S' (suffix).\n\nI got stuck a bit because a string could be both a prefix and a suffix of `s` (think palindromes). But the problem's guarantee of having exactly two of each length made me realize that even if a string appears as both a prefix and a suffix (and the input reflects this), one occurrence must be assigned to prefix and the other to suffix. The `collections.Counter` was perfect to ensure this logic is followed.\n\nTo be precise, I needed to identify candidate `s`, generate expected prefixes and suffixes, use the counts to find an assignment, and validate if the counts are all zero at the end!\n\nThe algorithm solidified:\n1.  Group input strings by length.\n2.  Find the two strings of length `n-1`. Try both scenarios for constructing `s`.\n3.  For each candidate `s`, generate expected prefixes and suffixes, and keep track of counts.\n4.  Iterate through the original input strings. Assign 'P' (prefix) if possible (decrement counter), otherwise 'S'.\n5.  Check if all counters are zero to validate. If yes, the assignment is correct.\n\nAfter some careful thought, and a few small revisions to my initial approach to handle palindromes, this approach felt solid and complete. The use of a `Counter` was a key insight, and the whole logic felt elegant and robust. Now I'm confident in implementing this to get the solution!\n",
    "response": "The solution proceeds by first identifying two candidate strings for the original secret string `s`. This is done by focusing on the two input strings of length `n-1`. One of these must be the prefix of `s` of length `n-1` (i.e., `s[0...n-2]`), and the other must be the suffix of `s` of length `n-1` (i.e., `s[1...n-1]`).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1.  **Read Input and Store with Indices:** The `2n-2` input strings are read, and each is stored along with its original index. This is crucial for printing the output in the correct order.\n\n2.  **Group Strings by Length:** The stored strings are then organized into a dictionary where keys are lengths (from `1` to `n-1`) and values are lists of `(string, original_index)` tuples. This makes it easy to access strings of a specific length.\n\n3.  **Identify `s` Candidates:**\n    *   From the `strings_by_length` dictionary, retrieve the two strings corresponding to length `n-1`. Let these be `str1` and `str2`.\n    *   There are two possibilities for how `str1` and `str2` relate to the original string `s`:\n        *   **Candidate 1:** `str1` is `s[0...n-2]` (the prefix of length `n-1`), and `str2` is `s[1...n-1]` (the suffix of length `n-1`). To reconstruct `s`, we can take `str1` and append the last character of `str2`. This is only valid if `str1[1:]` (the substring `s[1...n-2]`) is equal to `str2[:-1]` (also `s[1...n-2]`).\n        *   **Candidate 2:** `str2` is `s[0...n-2]`, and `str1` is `s[1...n-1]`. Similar consistency checks and reconstruction apply.\n    *   These consistency checks (`str1[1:] == str2[:-1]`) are essential to form a valid `s`. If the check fails, that candidate `s` is invalid.\n\n4.  **Validate `s` Candidate and Generate Assignment:**\n    *   A helper function `get_assignment(s_candidate, ...)` is used to test each potential `s`.\n    *   For a given `s_candidate`, it generates the full set of expected prefixes (`s_candidate[0:k]` for `k` from `1` to `n-1`) and expected suffixes (`s_candidate[n-k:]` for `k` from `1` to `n-1`).\n    *   `collections.Counter` objects (`p_counts` and `s_counts`) are initialized with these expected prefixes and suffixes. These counters will track how many times each string is still \"needed\" as a prefix or a suffix.\n    *   The function then iterates through the *original input strings* (preserving their original indices). For each input string:\n        *   If `p_counts[current_str]` is greater than 0, it means this string can be assigned as a prefix. So, `assignment[original_idx]` is set to 'P', and `p_counts[current_str]` is decremented. This strategy prioritizes assigning 'P' if possible.\n        *   Otherwise (if `p_counts[current_str]` is 0), it *must* be a suffix according to the problem guarantees. So, `assignment[original_idx]` is set to 'S', and `s_counts[current_str]` is decremented.\n    *   After all input strings are processed, the `p_counts` and `s_counts` are checked. If all counts are zero, it means every expected prefix and suffix was matched exactly once by an input string, making the `s_candidate` valid. The generated `assignment` string is then returned. Otherwise, `None` is returned, indicating an invalid `s_candidate`.\n\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   The `get_assignment` function is called first with `s_candidate1`. If it returns a valid assignment, that string is printed, and the program exits.\n    *   If `s_candidate1` was invalid or didn't lead to a full assignment, `get_assignment` is called with `s_candidate2`. The problem guarantees that at least one valid `s` exists, so this second attempt will always succeed if the first one didn't.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints, including the guarantee of exactly two strings for each length, and the possibility of a string being both a prefix and a suffix (e.g., \"a\" in \"ababa\").\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Store input strings along with their original indices\n    input_strings_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        input_strings_with_indices.append((s, i))\n    \n    # Group strings by length\n    # This will store lists of (string, original_index) for each length\n    strings_by_length = {length: [] for length in range(1, n)}\n    for s, idx in input_strings_with_indices:\n        strings_by_length[len(s)].append((s, idx))\n        \n    # Get the two strings of length n-1\n    # These are the candidates for s[0...n-2] and s[1...n-1]\n    str1_info = strings_by_length[n-1][0] # (string, original_index)\n    str2_info = strings_by_length[n-1][1] # (string, original_index)\n    \n    str1 = str1_info[0]\n    str2 = str2_info[0]\n\n    # Try two possibilities for the full string s\n    # Possibility 1: str1 is prefix s[0...n-2], str2 is suffix s[1...n-1]\n    s_candidate1 = \"\"\n    # Check consistency: the common part s[1...n-2] must match\n    if str1[1:] == str2[:-1]: \n        s_candidate1 = str1 + str2[-1]\n    \n    # Possibility 2: str2 is prefix s[0...n-2], str1 is suffix s[1...n-1]\n    s_candidate2 = \"\"\n    # Check consistency: the common part s[1...n-2] must match\n    if str2[1:] == str1[:-1]: \n        s_candidate2 = str2 + str1[-1]\n\n    # Function to validate an s_candidate and generate the answer string\n    def get_assignment(s_candidate, input_strings_with_indices, n):\n        if not s_candidate:\n            return None # Invalid s_candidate (e.g., consistency check failed)\n        \n        # Generate expected prefixes and suffixes for the current s_candidate\n        expected_prefixes = [s_candidate[0:k] for k in range(1, n)]\n        expected_suffixes = [s_candidate[n-k:] for k in range(1, n)]\n        \n        # Use Counters to track how many of each prefix/suffix are still needed\n        # This correctly handles cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix\n        # or where identical strings appear in the input (e.g., \"a\" for \"ababa\")\n        p_counts = Counter(expected_prefixes)\n        s_counts = Counter(expected_suffixes)\n        \n        assignment = [''] * (2 * n - 2) # Initialize result array\n        \n        # Iterate through the original input strings to make assignments\n        for current_str, original_idx in input_strings_with_indices:\n            # Prioritize 'P': if the string is an expected prefix and still available\n            if p_counts[current_str] > 0:\n                assignment[original_idx] = 'P'\n                p_counts[current_str] -= 1\n            # Otherwise, it must be an expected suffix (guaranteed by problem statement)\n            elif s_counts[current_str] > 0:\n                assignment[original_idx] = 'S'\n                s_counts[current_str] -= 1\n            else:\n                # This case indicates an inconsistency (e.g., string not found in expected sets\n                # or all its slots already used).
