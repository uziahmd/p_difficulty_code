He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Mental Roadmap for Validating a String**\n\nOkay, I'm tackling this string validation problem. My goal is a Python script that can efficiently determine if a given string `S` adheres to a specific set of formation rules. I need to break down the rules and establish a clear mental model.\n\nThe foundation is straightforward: the string must be composed of three distinct segments: 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's. This is the **structural constraint**: we can think of it as three \"phases\" the string goes through.\n\nNow, let's nail down the quantitative rules. Let's call the number of 'a's `count_a`, the number of 'b's `count_b`, and the number of 'c's `count_c`. The rules dictate:\n\n*   We must have at least one of each character (`count_a >= 1`, `count_b >= 1`, `count_c >= 1`). This is crucial because if we have, say, zero 'c's, it'll never satisfy the final condition.\n*   The number of 'c's (`count_c`) must equal the number of 'a's (`count_a`) OR the number of 'b's (`count_b`). It could even be equal to both!\n\nSo, the validation process has two parts. The first is about ensuring the **correct order** of characters. The characters have to appear in the order 'a', 'b', 'c'. A useful method is to iterate through the string and detect a character's \"phase\". I have to make sure the string is only a's at first, b's next, and c's lastly.\n\nFinally, I need to extract the counts of each character and verify that the counts comply with that last quantitative rule - the count of 'c's must equal the count of either 'a's or 'b's. This combination of structural and quantitative checks is the key. Given the string's length is limited to 5000, efficiency shouldn't be a major concern, so a relatively straightforward approach should suffice.\n",
