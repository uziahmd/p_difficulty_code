Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Vanya and Cards Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Vanya and Cards\" problem.  Let me break this down logically. I've got `n` cards with values between `-x` and `x`. My goal is to add the minimum number of new cards (also within the `-x` to `x` range) so that the total sum of all cards equals zero.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the `current_sum` by summing all the values on the found cards. Then, I need to figure out what the sum of the new cards (`target_sum_for_new_cards`) should be. That's simply the negative of the `current_sum`.  This is the amount I need to \"cancel out\" with the new cards.\n\nNow comes the crucial part. I know that each new card can have a value from `-x` to `x`.  So, each new card can at most contribute `x` towards the sum needed or contribute `-x`. In essence, each new card can help to reduce the `needed_magnitude` by up to `x`. Therefore, I need to determine the absolute value of the `target_sum_for_new_cards`.\n\nFinally, to calculate the minimum number of cards, I'll divide the `needed_magnitude` by `x`. Since I need a whole number of cards, I need to round up. Integer division will do the trick if I add `x - 1` to the numerator before the division. This ensures I get the correct `ceil` result. And that should be it! I'll put this into a concise Python script and get the solution.\n",
