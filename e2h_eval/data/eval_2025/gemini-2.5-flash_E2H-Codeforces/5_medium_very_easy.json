Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the game plan, as I see it:**\n\nThis \"Colored Boots\" problem is a classic matching scenario with a twist: the color compatibility rules. My gut says a greedy approach will be the most effective, as it usually is for these kinds of problems, especially when we're dealing with finding the *maximum* number of pairs.\n\nThe crux of the problem lies in these compatibility rules: specific colors match only with themselves ('a' with 'a'), a wildcard '?' matches anything, and a boot can only be in one pair. This screams bipartite matching, but the compatibility rules give us more structure than a completely general bipartite graph.\n\nMy strategy will be to prioritize matches based on their restrictiveness. First, I'll go for the 'exact matches' - the most constrained kind. Then, I'll handle matches involving the wildcard '?'. Finally, I'll pair up any remaining wildcards. This order should maximize the total number of pairs.\n\nLet's break it down into steps:\n\n1.  **Exact Matches (Specific-Specific):** I'll start by grouping boots with the same specific color. I'll maintain lists (or dictionaries) for each color, storing the indices of the left and right boots. If I have a left boot 'a' and a right boot 'a', that's a perfect match, and I'll immediately pair them up. This guarantees optimal use of these specific boots.\n\n2.  **Specific-Wildcard Matches:** After handling all exact matches, I'll turn my attention to the wildcards. Any remaining specific boots can now match with any available '?' boots. Since '?' is the most flexible, this is where it'll shine. I'll go through the remaining specific colors and pair them with available '?'.\n\n3.  **Wildcard-Wildcard Matches:** Finally, any leftover '?' boots can pair with each other. This is the least restrictive scenario, and it will pick up the last remaining matches.\n\nI'll use some efficient data structures. For each color (including '?'), I'll have two lists: one for left boot indices and one for right boot indices. I'll populate these from the input strings. During matching, I'll \"consume\" boots by popping indices from the lists. The number of pairs will depend on how many boots are consumed from those lists.\n\nI'm confident this greedy approach will work. It is designed so the most constrained matches occur first, which tends to be optimal in these scenarios. Let's start coding.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. We are given `n` left boots and `n` right boots, with their colors represented by characters in strings `l` and `r`. A specific color (lowercase letter) is compatible only with the same specific color. A question mark ('?') is an indefinite color and is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite). Each boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The core idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive, as these boots have fewer options. If we don't match them now, they might not be able to find a match later, or they might force a more flexible boot ('?') to be used in a suboptimal way.\n\nWe can categorize matches into three types based on restrictiveness:\n1.  **Specific color with the exact same specific color (e.g., 'a' with 'a'):** These are the most restrictive matches. Both boots require a specific, identical color. If such a match is possible, it's always optimal to make it. This uses up two specific boots and preserves the flexibility of any indefinite ('?') boots.\n2.  **Specific color with an indefinite color (e.g., 'a' with '?' or '?' with 'a'):** After all exact specific-to-specific matches are made, any remaining specific-color boots can only be matched with indefinite ('?') boots. It's best to use the flexible '?' boots to satisfy these specific boots, as specific boots have limited options.\n3.  **Indefinite color with an indefinite color (e.g., '?' with '?'):** These are the least restrictive matches. Any remaining '?' boots can be paired with other '?' boots. We perform these matches last, as '?' boots are versatile and can be used to fill any remaining specific-color deficits in the previous step.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices:** Create two dictionaries (or arrays of lists), `left_indices` and `right_indices`. Each key in these dictionaries will be a color (from 'a' to 'z' or '?'), and its value will be a list of 1-based indices of boots of that color.\n    *   Iterate through the `l` string: `left_indices[l[i]].append(i + 1)`\n    *   Iterate through the `r` string: `right_indices[r[i]].append(i + 1)`\n\n2.  **Step 1: Match Specific with Specific:**\n    *   Iterate through all specific colors `c` from 'a' to 'z'.\n    *   While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color `c`:\n        *   Pop an index from `left_indices[c]` and an index from `right_indices[c]`.\n        *   Record this pair.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Match Specific with Indefinite ('?'):**\n    *   Iterate through all specific colors `c` from 'a' to 'z'.\n    *   **Left Specific, Right Indefinite:** While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color '?':\n        *   Pop an index from `left_indices[c]` and an index from `right_indices['?']`.\n        *   Record this pair.\n    *   **Left Indefinite, Right Specific:** While there are available left boots of color '?' AND available right boots of color `c`:\n        *   Pop an index from `left_indices['?']` and an index from `right_indices[c]`.\n        *   Record this pair.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Match Indefinite ('?') with Indefinite ('?'):**\n    *   While there are available left boots of color '?' AND available right boots of color '?':\n        *   Pop an index from `left_indices['?']` and an index from `right_indices['?']`.\n        *   Record this pair.\n\n5.  **Output:** Print the total number of recorded pairs, followed by each pair on a new line.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n = 7`\n`l = \"abaca?b\"`\n`r = \"zabbbcc\"`\n\n**Initial Indices:**\n`left_indices`: {'a': [1, 3, 5], 'b': [2, 7], 'c': [4], '?': [6]}\n`right_indices`: {'z': [1], 'a': [2], 'b': [3, 4], 'c': [5, 6, 7]}\n\n**Step 1: Specific with Specific**\n- 'a': `left_indices['a']=[1,3,5]`, `right_indices['a']=[2]` -> Pair (5, 2)\n  `left_indices['a']=[1,3]`, `right_indices['a']=[]`\n- 'b': `left_indices['b']=[2,7]`, `right_indices['b']=[3,4]` -> Pair (7, 4), then (2, 3)\n  `left_indices['b']=[]`, `right_indices['b']=[]`\n- 'c': `left_indices['c']=[4]`, `right_indices['c']=[5,6,7]` -> Pair (4, 7)\n  `left_indices['c']=[]`, `right_indices['c']=[5,6]`\nPairs: `[(5, 2), (7, 4), (2, 3), (4, 7)]`\n\n**After Step 1 (Remaining Indices):**\n`left_indices`: {'a': [1, 3], 'b': [], 'c': [], '?': [6]}\n`right_indices`: {'z': [1], 'a': [], 'b': [], 'c': [5, 6]}\n\n**Step 2: Specific with Indefinite ('?')**\n- 'c': `left_indices['?']=[6]`, `right_indices['c']=[5,6]` -> Pair (6, 6)\n  `left_indices['?']=[]`, `right_indices['c']=[5]`\nPairs: `[(5, 2), (7, 4), (2, 3), (4, 7), (6, 6)]`\n\n**After Step 2 (Remaining Indices):**\n`left_indices`: {'a': [1, 3], 'b': [], 'c': [], '?': []}\n`right_indices`: {'z': [1], 'a': [], 'b': [], 'c': [5]}\n\n**Step 3: Indefinite ('?') with Indefinite ('?')**\n- No '?' left boots remaining, no '?' right boots remaining. No matches.\n\n**Final Result:** 5 pairs. This matches the count from the example output. The specific indices might differ but the total number of pairs is optimal.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n*   Populating indices: O(N)\n*   Steps 1, 2, and 3: Each boot index is added to a list once and popped from a list at most once.
