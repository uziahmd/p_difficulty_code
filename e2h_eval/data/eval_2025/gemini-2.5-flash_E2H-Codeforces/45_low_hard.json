There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about this \"Tennis Championship\" problem. I need to write a Python script for it.  The core of the problem is figuring out the maximum number of games the tournament winner can play, given this funky rule about how opponents are matched. It sounds like a fun dynamic programming challenge.\n\nThe rule's the key.  Two players can only face each other if the absolute difference in their \"experience level\" (number of wins) is at most 1.  So, if someone's won 'k' games, they can only play someone with 'k-1', 'k', or 'k+1' wins. That's the constraint I have to work with.\n\nI'm thinking of \"experience level\" as the number of games played and won. The goal is to maximize the winner's total games.  The winner needs to play 'X' games, meaning they've beaten 'X' opponents. And I know that a tournament with 'N' players always has 'N-1' games total, so that's a useful fact to keep in mind.\n\nI'm starting to formalize things. Let's say `f(k)` represents the minimum number of players needed to produce a winner who has played 'k' games.  My ultimate goal is to find the largest 'k' where `f(k)` is less than or equal to the total number of players, 'N'.\n\nI need to dig into this rule a little more.  If the winner has 'k' wins, the opponent can have `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1` wins.  I'm focusing on building a mental model of how the tournament might unfold to maximize the number of games. Let's see...\n\nIf the winner has `k=0`, I need only one player. That's `f(0) = 1`. \nFor `k=1`, the winner plays an opponent with `0` wins, making `f(1) = 2` players needed. This aligns with a simple tournament.\n\nFor `k=2`, the winner needs to defeat two opponents. The mental model is: the winner plays someone with 0 wins (1 vs 0), then plays someone with either 0 or 1 win (0 or 1 vs 1). I want to see how to structure the tournament. The tournament winner has to always be able to find a suitable opponent, which means I've got to carefully consider the matching of players.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. We are given the total number of players `n`.\n\nLet's denote the number of games a player has won so far as their \"experience level\". So, a player with `k` wins has played `k` games. The rule states that two players with `k1` and `k2` wins, respectively, can play if `abs(k1 - k2) <= 1`.\n\nWe want to find the maximum `k` such that a tournament winner can play `k` games, given `n` total players. To maximize the winner's games, we should try to make the winner play against opponents who have also played as many games as possible, while still adhering to the rule. This way, we use fewer \"fresh\" players for each game the winner plays.\n\nLet `F(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `k` games.\nWe want to find the largest `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's analyze `F(k)`:\n- `F(0)`: A player who hasn't played any games. This requires 1 player. `F(0) = 1`.\n- `F(1)`: A player wins 1 game. They play against an opponent who has 0 wins. This requires 1 winner + 1 opponent = 2 players. `F(1) = 2`.\n- `F(2)`: A player wins 2 games.\n    - To win their first game, they play against an opponent with 0 wins. (Winner now has 1 win).\n    - To win their second game, the winner (with 1 win) needs an opponent. This opponent can have 0, 1, or 2 wins. To minimize total players, the opponent should be someone who has played games, so they don't bring in too many new players.\n    - If the winner (1 win) plays against an opponent with 0 wins: This is allowed. This requires 2 players for the first game, and 2 players for the second game (one of them being the winner of the first game). Total 3 players (Winner, Opponent1, Opponent2). Example: (P1 vs P2), P1 wins. (P1 vs P3), P1 wins. P1 played 2 games. Total players = 3.\n    - If the winner (1 win) plays against an opponent with 1 win: This is allowed. This means the opponent also had to win 1 game. So, we need two players who have each won 1 game. Each of these players needs 2 players to achieve 1 win. So, we need `F(1)` players for the winner to get 1 win, and `F(1)` players for the opponent to get 1 win. Total `F(1) + F(1) = 2 + 2 = 4` players. Example: (P1 vs P2), P1 wins. (P3 vs P4), P3 wins. Then (P1 vs P3), P1 wins. P1 played 2 games. Total players = 4.\n    - The minimum number of players for `F(2)` is 3. This is achieved by the winner playing against opponents with 0 wins.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `F(k)` more systematically. To get a winner with `k` wins, that player must have won their `k`-th game. In this `k`-th game, the winner had `k-1` wins, and their opponent had `x` wins, where `abs( (k-1) - x ) <= 1`. So `x` could be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\nTo minimize the total number of players, the opponent should be \"as experienced as possible\" to avoid needing many new players. The best scenario for minimizing players is if the winner (with `k-1` wins) plays against an opponent who also has `k-1` wins.\nThis means we need `F(k-1)` players to produce the winner with `k-1` wins, and `F(k-1)` players to produce the opponent with `k-1` wins. So, `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-1) = 2 * F(k-1)`. This would lead to `F(k) = 2^k`, which is the standard power-of-2 structure for a balanced knockout tournament.\n\nHowever, the rule `abs(k1 - k2) <= 1` allows for more flexible pairings. Specifically, a player with `k-1` wins can play against an opponent with `k-2` wins.\nIf the winner (with `k-1` wins) plays against an opponent with `k-2` wins:\nWe need `F(k-1)` players to produce the winner with `k-1` wins.\nWe need `F(k-2)` players to produce the opponent with `k-2` wins.\nSo, `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)`.\n\nLet's check this recurrence:\n`F(0) = 1`\n`F(1) = 2` (As established earlier, a winner with 1 game needs 2 players total: P1 vs P2)\n`F(2)`:\nUsing `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)`: `F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`.\nThis is consistent with the example: N=3, winner plays 2 games.\n`F(3)`:\n`F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n`F(4)`:\n`F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`.\nThis is consistent with the example: N=10, winner plays 4 games. `F(4)=8 <= 10`. `F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 8 + 5 = 13`. Since `F(5)=13 > 10`, the winner cannot play 5 games with 10 players. So 4 is the maximum.\n\nThe sequence `F(k)` is the Fibonacci sequence, specifically:\n`F(0) = 1`\n`F(1) = 2`\n`F(2) = 3`\n`F(3) = 5`\n`F(4) = 8`\n...\nThis corresponds to `Fib(k+2)`, where `Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, ...`.\nSo, `F(k) = Fib(k+2)`.\n\nThe problem then reduces to finding the maximum `k` such that `Fib(k+2) <= n`.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. We can generate them iteratively until they exceed `n`.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    if n == 3:\n        print(2)\n        return\n\n    # F(k) = Fib(k+2)\n    # Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, ...\n    # Our F sequence:\n    # k=0: F(0)=1 (Fib(2))\n    # k=1: F(1)=2 (Fib(3))\n    # k=2: F(2)=3 (Fib(4))\n    # k=3: F(3)=5 (Fib(5))\n    # k=4: F(4)=8 (Fib(6))\n\n    # Initialize with F(0) and F(1) values\n    f_prev = 1  # Corresponds to F(k-2) in the recurrence, or Fib(k)\n    f_curr = 2  # Corresponds to F(k-1) in the recurrence, or Fib(k+1)\n    \n    # We are looking for k.\n    # Current max_games found is 1 (for n=2)\n    max_games = 1 \n\n    # Start checking for k=2\n    # f_prev corresponds to F(k_val-2)\n    # f_curr corresponds to F(k_val-1)\n    # We want to calculate F(k_val) = f_prev + f_curr\n    k_val = 2 \n    while True:\n        f_next = f_prev + f_curr\n        if f_next > n:\n            break\n        \n        max_games = k_val\n        f_prev = f_curr\n        f_curr = f_next\n        k_val += 1\n    \n    print(max_games)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
