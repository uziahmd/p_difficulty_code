There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem, and the goal is to maximize profit from house heights given some constraints. The setup is pretty standard: `n` spots, a maximum height `h`, and `m` zoning restrictions. Each spot's profit is the square of its height (`a^2`), and the restrictions are interval-based, dictating the maximum allowable height within certain ranges.  The crucial thing I noticed is that the constraints,  `n, h, m <= 50`, are *very* small. This immediately makes me think that a polynomial-time solution should be perfectly feasible, even something in the O(N^3) or O(N^4) ballpark.\n\nMy first step is to break down how to handle these restrictions.  For each spot `i`, the actual height `H_i` has two constraints: the overall maximum height `h` and the height limits imposed by the restrictions. To satisfy all the rules, the maximum height for each spot, which I'm calling `max_h_i`, has to be the minimum of `h` and all the `x_j` values associated with restrictions that cover that spot `i`. Mathematically, `H_i` must be at most `min(h, min(x_j for all j where l_j <= i <= r_j))`.\n\nSince profit is `H_i^2`, and squares are an increasing function for non-negative values, the optimal height for each spot is just the effective maximum height I just worked out, `max_h_i`.  Therefore, I can maximize total profit by maximizing each individual spot's height. This implies that the height for spot `i` is set equal to the calculated maximum allowed height `max_h_i`.\n\nLet's formalize this. I'll initialize an array, `max_h`, with all elements set to `h`. Then, for each restriction `(l, r, x)`, I need to iterate through the spots within that restriction's range and update the `max_h` value. In particular, for each spot `i` in the interval `[l, r]`, I'll update `max_h_i` to be `min(max_h_i, x)`. This ensures that each `max_h_i` now incorporates the effect of all relevant zoning restrictions.  After running through all the restrictions, the final profit is simply the sum of the squares of the `max_h_i` values.\n\nI'll quickly trace through the example. With the initial `max_h` of `[3, 3, 3]`, and then applying each restriction sequentially, it's clear how the calculations work.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot `i`, if a house has height `a`, it yields `a^2` profit. The height `a` must be an integer between `0` and `h`. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house within a given range `[l_j, r_j]` must be at most `x_j`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on the height of a house at a specific spot `i`.\n1. **General Height Limit:** Every house must have a height between `0` and `h` (inclusive). So, `0 <= H_i <= h`.\n2. **Zoning Restrictions:** For every restriction `j` that covers spot `i` (i.e., `l_j <= i <= r_j`), the height `H_i` must be at most `x_j`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `i`, its height `H_i` must satisfy `0 <= H_i <= h` AND `H_i <= x_j` for all `j` such that `l_j <= i <= r_j`.\nThis means that for each spot `i`, its height `H_i` must be at most the minimum of `h` and all `x_j` values from restrictions covering spot `i`.\nLet's define `allowed_max_height[i]` as this maximum possible height for spot `i`.\nInitially, `allowed_max_height[i]` can be set to `h` for all spots `i`.\nThen, for each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`:\nFor every spot `k` from `l_j` to `r_j` (inclusive), we update `allowed_max_height[k] = min(allowed_max_height[k], x_j)`.\n\nAfter processing all `m` restrictions, `allowed_max_height[i]` will store the actual maximum height a house at spot `i` can have while satisfying all conditions.\n\nTo maximize the total profit, we want to maximize the profit from each individual house. Since the profit `a^2` is an increasing function for `a >= 0`, to maximize `H_i^2`, we should choose the largest possible integer height for `H_i`. This largest possible height is exactly `allowed_max_height[i]`.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy is to set `H_i = allowed_max_height[i]` for each spot `i`.\nThe total maximum profit will then be the sum of `H_i^2` for all `i` from `1` to `n`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize an array `allowed_max_height` of size `n`, where each element `allowed_max_height[i]` is set to `h`. (Using 0-indexed array, so spots `0` to `n-1` correspond to `1` to `n`).\n2. Read `m` restrictions. For each restriction `(l, r, x)`:\n   Iterate `i` from `l-1` to `r-1` (to adjust for 0-indexing).\n   Update `allowed_max_height[i] = min(allowed_max_height[i], x)`.\n3. Calculate the total profit: Initialize `total_profit = 0`.\n   Iterate `i` from `0` to `n-1`.\n   Add `allowed_max_height[i] * allowed_max_height[i]` to `total_profit`.\n4. Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example 1 Trace:**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nInitial `allowed_max_height = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3)\n\nRestrictions:\n1. `l=1, r=1, x=1`:\n   `allowed_max_height[0] = min(allowed_max_height[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n   `allowed_max_height` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`.\n2. `l=2, r=2, x=3`:\n   `allowed_max_height[1] = min(allowed_max_height[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n   `allowed_max_height` remains `[1, 3, 3]`.\n3. `l=3, r=3, x=2`:\n   `allowed_max_height[2] = min(allowed_max_height[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n   `allowed_max_height` becomes `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\nFinal optimal heights: `[1, 3, 2]`.\nTotal profit: `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Initialization: O(N)\n- Processing `m` restrictions: Each restriction involves iterating up to `N` spots.
