String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Beautiful String\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem. It wants me to count \"beautiful strings.\"  Let me break this down. A beautiful string is one made up only of zeros and ones, with a specific number of each: `n` zeros and `m` ones. The twist is this modification operation. I need to figure out how many such strings, after being altered by the given method, will result in a specific target character, `g`.\n\nThe modification itself is key. It's about reducing the string, essentially, from right to left.  We start with a string of length `n+m` and, with each step, we shorten it by one character.  It feels like a kind of right-associative reduction.  The operation, `f(x, y)`, is pretty straightforward: If you have two zeros, the result is a one; otherwise, it's zero.\n\nThe key observation here is that if the original string ends in a '1', the first modification will result in a '0'. The character being '1' acts as an absorber, always forcing the outcome to be '0'. This suggests there might be a pattern I can exploit. So, what I need to do is to explore these properties to narrow down this search.\n\nSo, I need to represent this mathematically, maybe looking at how the initial configuration affects the final reduction. I can simplify this further by replacing '0' with 0 and '1' with 1, as that helps with the logic. It's all about finding the right way to efficiently count these strings, making sure I don't miss anything, and that I modulo the result along the way!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones such that applying a specific modification operation repeatedly results in a target character `g`. The count should be modulo 1000000007.\n\nLet's analyze the modification operation. It replaces the two last characters `x` (second to last) and `y` (last) with a new character `z`.\n- If `x=0, y=0`, then `z=1`.\n- If `x=0, y=1`, then `z=0`.\n- If `x=1, y=0`, then `z=0`.\n- If `x=1, y=1`, then `z=0`.\n\nThis operation is applied repeatedly until only one character remains. This means the operation is right-associative: `f(c_1, f(c_2, f(... f(c_{k-1}, c_k)...)))`.\n\nLet's observe the behavior of the operation:\n1.  **If the last character `y` is '1'**:\n    `f(x, 1)` is always '0' (for `x=0` or `x=1`).\n    This means if the original string `s` ends with '1', the first modification will replace `c_{k-1}c_k` with '0'. The new string ends with '0'.\n    Then, the next modification will be `f(c_{k-2}, 0)`. This is '1' if `c_{k-2}=0` and '0' if `c_{k-2}=1`.\n    Effectively, if the string contains at least one '1', and that '1' is not the very first character, the final result will be '0'.\n    Consider the rightmost '1' in the string. Let the string be `... X 1 0 0 ... 0` (where `X` is some character and there are `k >= 0` zeros after the '1').\n    `f(0,0)=1`. `f(1,0)=0`. `f(X,1)=0`.\n    The sequence of operations from right to left:\n    `f(0,0)=1`\n    `f(0,1)=0`\n    `f(0,0)=1`\n    `f(1,1)=0`\n    `f(1,0)=0`\n    This operation is equivalent to XORing the bits, but if two zeros are XORed, the result is 1, not 0.\n    Let's analyze the parity of ones.\n    If we consider the values modulo 2, `f(x,y)` is `(x+y+1) % 2` if `x=0, y=0`, and `(x+y) % 2` otherwise. This is not simple XOR.\n\n    A simpler observation:\n    If the string `s` contains at least one '1', and this '1' is *not* the leftmost character `c_1`:\n    Let the string be `c_1 ... c_j ... c_k`. Suppose `c_j` is the rightmost '1' that is not `c_1`. So `c_{j+1}, ..., c_k` are all '0's.\n    The operations will first process `c_{j+1} ... c_k`.\n    `f(c_{k-1}, c_k)` reduces the number of trailing zeros.\n    `f(0,0)=1`.\n    `f(0, f(0,0)) = f(0,1) = 0`.\n    `f(0, f(0, f(0,0))) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n    The result of processing `k-j` trailing zeros, starting with `c_{j+1}=0`, is `1` if `k-j` is even, and `0` if `k-j` is odd.\n    So, after processing all zeros to the right of `c_j`, we effectively have `c_1 ... c_j R`, where `R` is the result of reducing `c_{j+1} ... c_k` to a single character.\n    If `c_j` is '1', and `R` is the result of reducing the suffix `c_{j+1} ... c_k`:\n    The next step is `f(c_j, R) = f(1, R)`.\n    - If `R=0`, `f(1,0)=0`.\n    - If `R=1`, `f(1,1)=0`.\n    In either case, `f(1, R)` is '0'.\n    This means if there is any '1' in the string that is not the first character, the final result will be '0'.\n    The only exception is if the *only* '1' in the string is the first character `c_1`. In this case, `s = 100...0`.\n    For `s = 10...0` (with `m=1` and `n` zeros):\n    The suffix `0...0` (n zeros) reduces to '1' if `n` is even, and '0' if `n` is odd.\n    So, `s` reduces to `f(1, R)`.\n    - If `n` is even, `R=1`, `f(1,1)=0`.\n    - If `n` is odd, `R=0`, `f(1,0)=0`.\n    So even in this case, the result is '0'.\n\n    Therefore, if `m >= 1` (there is at least one '1' in the string), the final character will always be '0'.\n\n2.  **If `m = 0` (the string consists only of '0's)**:\n    The string is `00...0` (`n` zeros).\n    `f(0,0)=1`.\n    `f(0, f(0,0)) = f(0,1) = 0`.\n    `f(0, f(0, f(0,0))) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n    The result for `n` zeros is '1' if `n` is even, and '0' if `n` is odd.\n    This can be seen as `(n-1) % 2 == 0` for result '1' and `(n-1) % 2 == 1` for result '0'. Or, more simply, `(n % 2 == 1)` gives '0', `(n % 2 == 0)` gives '1'.\n    Wait, `n` is the length.\n    `n=1`: \"0\" -> 0.\n    `n=2`: \"00\" -> 1.\n    `n=3`: \"000\" -> f(0, f(0,0)) = f(0,1) = 0.\n    `n=4`: \"0000\" -> f(0, f(0, f(0,0))) = f(0, f(0,1)) = f(0,0) = 1.\n    The result is '0' if `n` is odd, and '1' if `n` is even.\n\nSummary of final character based on `n` and `m`:\n-   If `m >= 1`: The final character is '0'.\n-   If `m = 0`: The final character is '0' if `n` is odd, and '1' if `n` is even.\n\nNow we need to count strings that satisfy these conditions.\nThe total number of strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones is `C(n+m, n)` (or `C(n+m, m)`).\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`. We need combinations `C(N, K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!) % MOD`.\nWe'll precompute factorials and inverse factorials.\n\n**Case 1: `g = 0`**\nWe need the final character to be '0'.\n-   If `m >= 1`: All `C(n+m, n)` strings result in '0'.\n-   If `m = 0`:\n    -   If `n` is odd: The string `00...0` (which is the only possible string) results in '0'. So count is 1.\n    -   If `n` is even: The string `00...0` results in '1'. So count is 0.\n\n**Case 2: `g = 1`**\nWe need the final character to be '1'.\n-   If `m >= 1`: No strings result in '1'. So count is 0.\n-   If `m = 0`:\n    -   If `n` is odd: The string `00...0` results in '0'. So count is 0.\n    -   If `n` is even: The string `00...0` results in '1'. So count is 1.\n\nLet's combine these logic branches:\n\n**`g = 0`:**\n1.  If `m >= 1`: Answer is `C(n+m, n)`.\n2.  If `m = 0`:\n    a.  If `n` is odd: Answer is 1.\n    b.  If `n` is even: Answer is 0.\n\n**`g = 1`:**\n1.  If `m >= 1`: Answer is 0.\n2.  If `m = 0`:\n    a.  If `n` is odd: Answer is 0.\n    b.  If `n` is even: Answer is 1.\n\nEdge cases: `n+m >= 1`.\n-   If `n=0, m=1, g=0`: String \"1\". Result 0. `C(1,0)=1`. Correct.\n-   If `n=0, m=1, g=1`: String \"1\". Result 0. `0`. Correct.\n-   If `n=1, m=0, g=0`: String \"0\". Result 0. `1`. Correct.\n-   If `n=1, m=0, g=1`: String \"0\". Result 0. `0`. Correct.\n-   If `n=2, m=0, g=0`: String \"00\". Result 1. `0`. Correct.\n-   If `n=2, m=0, g=1`: String \"00\". Result 1. `1`. Correct.\n\nThe logic seems solid.
