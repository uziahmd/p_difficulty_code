    "thought": "**Optimizing Triangle Counting: An Expert's Perspective**\n\nAs an expert in algorithms, I've been tasked with efficiently counting non-degenerate triangles.  Given the constraints A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D, I immediately recognized that, due to the ordering, the only crucial inequality is x + y > z.  This insight simplifies the problem significantly.\n\nMy thought process then shifted to optimizing the count. Iterating through all possible x and y values, while technically correct, quickly became impractical due to its quadratic time complexity. Therefore, I moved to a more efficient approach.  I decided to fix x and y to calculate the number of valid z values, but I needed to analyze that sum further to derive an efficient solution.\n\nBy introducing k = x + y, I transformed the problem into iterating k rather than individual x, y pairs. This is a very common technique to move from two loops into a simpler loop.  The z constraints became clear: C ≤ z < k ( and z <= D). The number of z becomes dependent only on k.\n\nI noticed that f(k), which represents the count of valid z values for a given k, can be expressed in a closed-form formula. Now, I have to iterate k and sum the f(k) but I need to know how many x and y can sum into that k.  The next step was to precompute a count of the distinct pairs (x, y) that sum to k, which I termed g(k).\n\nThe key was recognizing that the sum becomes a product of these two function that is computable. The problem is now to design an efficient algorithm to compute g(k) by considering the constraints on x and y in terms of their sums. The critical piece of this optimization is the g(k) computation.\n\nBy recognizing the bounds of the variables in the equation and iterating within those bounds, and exploiting the fact that g(k) and f(k) are linear or constant within certain ranges (which are easily calculable using the given bounds), the final solution is elegant and efficient.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's establish the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle. For sides `x, y, z`, the triangle inequality must hold:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we know that `x <= y <= z`.\nIf `x <= y <= z`, the conditions `x + z > y` and `y + z > x` are automatically satisfied:\n- Since `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`, `x + z >= 1 + y > y`.\n- Since `z >= C >= B >= y` and `y >= B >= A >= 1`, `y + z >= y + y >= y + x > x`. (Actually, `y+z > x` is true because `z >= y >= x`, so `y+z >= x+x > x` if `x>0`).\nTherefore, the only condition we need to check is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of integer triplets `(x, y, z)` satisfying:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nLet `S = x + y`. The condition `x + y > z` becomes `S > z`, or `z <= S - 1`.\nFor fixed `x` and `y`, `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= D` and `z <= S - 1`.\nCombining these, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, S - 1)]`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a given `S` is `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`. Let's call this `count_z(S)`.\n\nThe possible range for `S = x + y` is:\n- Minimum `S`: `x_min + y_min = A + B`\n- Maximum `S`: `x_max + y_max = B + C`\nSo `S` ranges from `A + B` to `B + C`.\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate `x` from `A` to `B`, `y` from `B` to `C`, calculate `S = x + y`, and then add `count_z(S)` to the total. This would be `O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1))`, which is too slow given `D` can be `5 * 10^5`.\n\nWe can optimize this by changing the order of summation. Instead of iterating `x` and `y` separately, we can iterate over possible values of `S = x + y`.\nFor each `S` in `[A+B, B+C]`, we need to find how many pairs `(x, y)` exist such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = S`. Let this count be `count_xy(S)`.\nThen the total number of triangles is `sum_{S=A+B to B+C} count_xy(S) * count_z(S)`.\n\nLet's find `count_xy(S)`:\nFor a fixed `S`, `y = S - x`.\nThe conditions on `x` and `y` become:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= S - x <= C`  => `S - C <= x <= S - B`\n\nCombining these, `x` must be in the range `[max(A, S - C), min(B, S - B)]`.\nThe number of such `x` values (and thus `(x, y)` pairs) is `max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1)`. Let's call this `count_xy(S)`.\n\nNow, the algorithm becomes:\n1. Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n2. Create an array `counts_S` of size `B + C + 1` (to store `count_xy(S)` for each `S`). Initialize with zeros.\n3. Populate `counts_S`: Iterate `S` from `A + B` to `B + C`. For each `S`:\n   `x_lower = max(A, S - C)`\n   `x_upper = min(B, S - B)`\n   If `x_lower <= x_upper`, then `counts_S[S] = x_upper - x_lower + 1`. Otherwise, `counts_S[S] = 0`.\n   This step takes `O(B+C)` time.\n4. Calculate the total triangles: Iterate `S` from `A + B` to `B + C`. For each `S`:\n   `num_z = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`\n   `total_triangles += counts_S[S] * num_z`\n   This step also takes `O(B+C)` time.\n\nThe maximum value of `B + C` is `5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5 = 10^6`.\nSo the total time complexity is `O(B+C)`, which is `O(10^6)` operations. This is efficient enough.\nThe maximum value of `total_triangles` can be `(B+C) * (B-A+1) * (D-C+1)` which is roughly `10^6 * 5*10^5 * 5*10^5 = 2.5 * 10^17`. This fits within a 64-bit integer type (Python integers handle arbitrary size automatically).\n\nExample 1: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\nRange for `S`: `A+B=3` to `B+C=5`.\n`counts_S` calculation:\n- `S=3`: `x_lower = max(1, 3-3)=1`, `x_upper = min(2, 3-2)=1`. `counts_S[3] = 1-1+1=1`. (Pair `(x=1, y=2)`)\n- `S=4`: `x_lower = max(1, 4-3)=1`, `x_upper = min(2, 4-2)=2`. `counts_S[4] = 2-1+1=2`. (Pairs `(x=1, y=3), (x=2, y=2)`)\n- `S=5`: `x_lower = max(1, 5-3)=2`, `x_upper = min(2, 5-2)=2`. `counts_S[5] = 2-2+1=1`. (Pair `(x=2, y=3)`)\n\nTotal triangles calculation:\n- `S=3`: `num_z = max(0, min(4, 3-1)-3+1) = max(0, min(4,2)-3+1) = max(0, 2-3+1) = 0`. (No `z` for `S=3` because `z>=3` and `z < S=3` is impossible). `total += 1 * 0 = 0`.\n- `S=4`: `num_z = max(0, min(4, 4-1)-3+1) = max(0, min(4,3)-3+1) = max(0, 3-3+1) = 1`. (`z=3`). `total += 2 * 1 = 2`.\n- `S=5`: `num_z = max(0, min(4, 5-1)-3+1) = max(0, min(4,4)-3+1) = max(0, 4-3+1) = 2`. (`z=3, z=4`). `total += 1 * 2 = 2`.\n\nFinal total: `0 + 2 + 2 = 4`. This matches the example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # counts_S[s] will store the number of pairs (x, y) such that x + y = s\n    # and A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C.\n    # The minimum sum S = x+y is A+B.\n    # The maximum sum S = x+y is B+C.\n    max_s = B + C\n    counts_S = [0] * (max_s + 1)\n\n    # Populate counts_S\n    # For each possible sum S, calculate the range of x values\n    # x must satisfy:\n    # 1.
