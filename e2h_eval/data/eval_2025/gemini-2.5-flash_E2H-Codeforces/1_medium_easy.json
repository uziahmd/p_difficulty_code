The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thought process for this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate with multiple gilded rings.  The plate has dimensions `w` and `h` (width and height), and there are `k` rings.  Each ring sits on the border of a smaller rectangle within the plate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the rings are defined. The problem says the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (`w x h`). Then each subsequent ring is formed by bordering cells on an inner rectangle that shrinks with each ring. Specifically, the *i*-th ring borders a rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  The shrinking is the key to getting this right. Each ring effectively goes in 2 cells from the edge of the previous one.\n\nThe constraints are important here! `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. The constraint on `k` is to ensure we always have a valid ring size (at least a `3x3` rectangle).  The formula confirms that the inner dimensions, after each ring, will always be at least `3x3`.\n\nSo for each ring, I need to figure out the number of border cells.  For a rectangle with dimensions `W x H`, the number of border cells is  `2 * W + 2 * H - 4` (except for a 1x1 or 1x2 rectangle where the border is the perimeter). The key to the solution is using that number in a loop. I use `current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)` and `current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)` inside of a loop where i goes from 1 to k.\n\nI need to initialize a `total_gilded_cells` counter to zero and then loop from the first to `k`th ring.  Inside the loop, for each ring `i`, I calculate the dimensions (`current_w` and `current_h`) of its inner rectangle. I also calculate `ring_cells = 2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`. Then, add this to the `total_gilded_cells`. The answer is the final value of this total.\n\nI checked a few examples to be sure the logic is working. Then I coded it up in Python. I added comments so I can follow it and understand what is going on at each step in the code. I used `sys.stdin.readline` to get the input. The algorithm is O(k) since I only have one loop. I know that since the max k is small, the loop will terminate very quickly. I'm confident about the correctness, and it runs very efficiently.\n",
