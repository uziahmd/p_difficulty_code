He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Converting Between Bases: My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to handle base conversions. The core of it seems straightforward: take a number `c` in base `a` and convert it to base `b`. The inputs are `a`, `b`, and `c`, and I have some constraints to keep in mind, like the ranges of `a` and `b`, the limits on the decimal value of `c`, and handling of leading zeros.\n\nIt's a two-step process, really. First, I have to get that string `c` into a decimal (base 10) value. Then, I need to convert that decimal value into the target base `b`, which could be a regular integer base or Roman numerals.\n\nFor converting `c` to decimal, I'll define a `char_to_int` function to handle those digits greater than 9, like 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11, and so on. That means I can easily parse the input string `c` into its numerical value in base `a`. I can iterate through the string, starting from the least significant digit, and accumulate the decimal value. I can definitely handle the leading zeros by the way I designed it.\n\n```python\ndef char_to_int(char):\n    if '0' <= char <= '9':\n        return int(char)\n    elif 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n        return ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n    return -1 # Should not happen with valid input\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s_num, base_a):\n    decimal_value = 0\n    power = 0\n    # Iterate from right to left (least significant digit to most significant)\n    for char in reversed(s_num):\n        digit_value = char_to_int(char)\n        decimal_value += digit_value * (base_a ** power)\n        power += 1\n    return decimal_value\n```\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, I'll need a separate logic based on the value of `b`. If `b` is an integer, I can use the standard division method to perform the conversion. If `b` is 'R' (for Roman numerals), I'll need a separate function. That should handle it.\n",
    "response": "The problem requires converting a number `c` from an arbitrary base `a` (2 to 25) to another base `b`. Base `b` can either be an integer (2 to 25) or the special Roman numeral system, denoted by 'R'.\n\nThe solution involves two main steps:\n1.  **Convert the input number `c` from base `a` to its decimal (base 10) representation.**\n    *   This involves iterating through the digits of `c` from right to left.\n    *   For each digit, convert its character representation (0-9, A-O for values 10-24) to an integer.\n    *   Multiply this integer by `a` raised to the power of its position (0 for the rightmost digit, increasing by 1 for each position to the left).\n    *   Sum these products to get the decimal value.\n\n2.  **Convert the decimal value to the target base `b`.**\n    *   **If `b` is an integer base:**\n        *   Repeatedly divide the decimal number by `b`, taking the remainder as the next digit (from right to left).\n        *   Convert the remainder (0-9, A-O) to its character representation.\n        *   Concatenate these characters in reverse order to form the base `b` string.\n        *   Handle the special case where the decimal value is 0 (output \"0\").\n    *   **If `b` is 'R' (Roman numerals):**\n        *   This requires a specific mapping and logic for Roman numeral construction, including the subtractive principle (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).\n        *   The maximum value for Roman numerals is 3000.\n        *   A common approach is to define a list of (value, Roman_symbol) pairs in descending order. Iterate through this list, appending the Roman symbol as many times as its value fits into the remaining decimal number, then subtracting that value.\n\n**Helper Functions:**\n\n*   `char_to_int(char)`: Converts a character ('0'-'9', 'A'-'O') to its integer value.\n*   `int_to_char(val)`: Converts an integer value (0-24) to its character representation.\n*   `decimal_to_roman(num)`: Converts a decimal number to its Roman numeral string. This function implements the logic for constructing Roman numerals based on the provided rules.\n\n**Detailed `decimal_to_roman` logic:**\nThe Roman numeral system uses specific symbols for certain values and combines them. The subtractive principle (e.g., IV=4, IX=9) is crucial. We can predefine a list of values and their corresponding Roman symbols, ordered from largest to smallest, including the subtractive pairs.\n\n```python\nROMAN_MAP = [\n    (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n]\n```\nThen, iterate through this `ROMAN_MAP`. For each `(value, symbol)` pair, repeatedly append `symbol` to the result string and subtract `value` from the decimal number as long as the decimal number is greater than or equal to `value`.\n\n**Input Processing:**\nThe first line contains `a` and `b`. `b` needs to be checked if it's 'R'.\nThe second line contains the string `c`.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   Leading zeros in input `c`: Handled correctly by base conversion to decimal. `001` in base 10 is `1`.\n*   Output leading zeros: The output conversion functions are designed to not produce leading zeros, except for the number 0 itself (which is only possible if `b` is not 'R'). The problem states that if Roman numerals are included, the number won't be 0. For other cases, `decimal_to_base_b(0, some_base)` correctly returns \"0\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Helper function to convert a character digit to its integer value\ndef char_to_int(char):\n    if '0' <= char <= '9':\n        return int(char)\n    else:  # 'A' through 'O' for bases > 10 (max base 25)\n        return ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n\n# Helper function to convert an integer value to its character digit\ndef int_to_char(val):\n    if 0 <= val <= 9:\n        return str(val)\n    else:  # 10 through 24\n        return chr(ord('A') + val - 10)\n\n# Convert number string from base_a to decimal (base 10)\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s_num, base_a):\n    decimal_value = 0\n    power = 0\n    # Iterate from right to left (least significant digit to most significant)\n    for char in reversed(s_num):\n        digit_value = char_to_int(char)\n        decimal_value += digit_value * (base_a ** power)\n        power += 1\n    return decimal_value\n\n# Convert decimal (base 10) number to a string in target_base\ndef decimal_to_base_b(decimal_value, target_base):\n    if decimal_value == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n\n    result_digits = []\n    while decimal_value > 0:\n        remainder = decimal_value % target_base\n        result_digits.append(int_to_char(remainder))\n        decimal_value //= target_base\n    \n    # Digits were collected in reverse order, so reverse them for the final string\n    return \"\".join(reversed(result_digits))\n\n# Convert decimal (base 10) number to Roman numerals\ndef decimal_to_roman(decimal_value):\n    # Roman numeral mapping including subtractive pairs, ordered from largest to smallest\n    ROMAN_MAP = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n\n    roman_numeral = []\n    for value, symbol in ROMAN_MAP:\n        while decimal_value >= value:\n            roman_numeral.append(symbol)\n            decimal_value -= value\n    \n    return \"\".join(roman_numeral)\n\ndef solve():\n    line1 = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    a = int(line1[0])\n    b_str = line1[1] # Keep b as string to check for 'R'\n\n    c_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Step 1: Convert c from base a to decimal\n    decimal_val = base_a_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\n    # Step 2: Convert decimal to target base b\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        result = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\n        result = decimal_to_base_b(decimal_val, b)\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(result + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
