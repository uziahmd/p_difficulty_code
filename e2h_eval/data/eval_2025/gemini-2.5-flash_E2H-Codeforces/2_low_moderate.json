Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"X\" Grid Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got the problem statement in my head. I need to write a Python script to check if a character grid forms an \"X\" based on specific constraints.  It's an `n x n` grid, with `n` being odd and between 3 and 300.  The core idea is the \"X\" shape: the diagonals have to be the *same* character, and everything else has to be a *different* single character.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to represent the grid.  A 2D list or a list of strings is perfect.  Let's call it `paper`. Then, I'll need to define the diagonals mathematically.  The main diagonal is where the row and column indices are equal (`row == col`). The other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) is where `row + col == n - 1`.\n\nNow, the algorithm. I'll read in `n` and then the grid itself.  I'll need two character variables: `diag_char` for the character on the diagonals, and `other_char` for the other cells.  I'll grab `diag_char` from any cell on a diagonal, like `paper[0][0]`.  `other_char` can be taken from a non-diagonal cell, such as `paper[0][1]`.  A quick sanity check: if `diag_char` and `other_char` are the *same* initially, it's impossible to form an \"X,\" so I'll print \"NO\" and quit right away.\n\nThen comes the critical part:  I'll iterate through every cell in the grid `(r, c)`. For each cell, I have to check if it's on a diagonal. If it is (either `r == c` or `r + c == n - 1`), I need to ensure the character matches `diag_char`.  If it's *not* on a diagonal, it has to be `other_char`.  If any of these checks fail, I immediately print \"NO\" and exit the program.  If I can get through the entire grid and all checks pass, then I know it's a valid \"X,\" so I'll print \"YES.\"  I think I have a solid plan now.  Time to code this up!\n",
