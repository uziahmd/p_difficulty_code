Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**X-Shaped Grid Solver**\n\nAlright, so I'm tasked with crafting a Python script to determine whether a given square grid of characters forms an \"X\" shape based on certain constraints. The grid size, *n*, is always an odd number between 3 and 300. The rules are pretty straightforward: all letters along both diagonals must be identical, and all other (non-diagonal) squares must contain a *different* single character, and again, all those \"other\" characters must also be the same.\n\nFirst off, I'll need to read in the grid size, *n*, and then the grid itself, which is just an *n x n* collection of characters, using, say, a list of strings. My initial thought is to use nested loops to iterate through each cell of the grid.\n\nTo make things clearer, I'll set up two variables: `diag_char` for the character expected on the diagonals and `other_char` for the rest of the grid. Both will be initialized to `None`. Then, I'll go through each cell `(i, j)` in the grid. If a cell is on either diagonal (`i == j` or `i + j == n - 1`), I'll check its character against `diag_char`.  If it's the first diagonal character I've seen, I'll assign it to `diag_char`; otherwise, I'll compare it to what's already there and bail out with \"NO\" if it's different. I'll need to remember to also check against `other_char` if that has been assigned.\n\nLikewise, for any non-diagonal cell, I will deal with the respective `other_char` using the same logic as above.\n\nI'm thinking a nested loop approach will work nicely for traversing the grid.  I'll set up two nested `for` loops, one for rows (`i`) and one for columns (`j`). Inside those loops, I will have the diagonal/non-diagonal character comparison logic. If I find any inconsistency along the way (a diagonal character doesn't match the expected `diag_char`, or a non-diagonal character doesn't match the expected `other_char`), I'll immediately print \"NO\" and stop the process.\n\nOnce the loops have finished, assuming no violations have been found, I have to perform the final check: `diag_char` must be different from `other_char`. If they are the same, it's not a valid \"X\", so I'll output \"NO\"; otherwise, it's a \"YES\". I will need to make sure that \"YES\" or \"NO\" are the outputs.\n\nI am feeling confident with this overall approach and it matches my expert-level understanding of the problem.\n",
