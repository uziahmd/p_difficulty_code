Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for \"New Year Candles\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"New Year Candles\" and I need to write a Python script to solve it.  The core idea is pretty straightforward: Vasily starts with `a` candles, each burning for an hour.  He can recycle `b` burnt-out candles into a new one.  The goal is to find the total hours Vasily can light the room.\n\nMy thinking is to model this as an iterative process.  I'll keep track of the `total_hours` of light, the number of `current_new_candles`, and the `burnt_out_candles` Vasily has accumulated.  I'll start with `total_hours = 0` and `current_new_candles = a`.  Then, while there are still `current_new_candles` available, I'll do the following:\n\n1.  Add the `current_new_candles` to the `total_hours`.\n2.  Add the `current_new_candles` to the `burnt_out_candles` (as they're now burnt out).\n3.  Calculate how many new candles Vasily can get from recycling: `new_candles_from_recycling = burnt_out_candles // b`.\n4.  Update the remaining `burnt_out_candles`: `burnt_out_candles = burnt_out_candles % b`.\n5.  Set the `current_new_candles` to the newly recycled ones: `current_new_candles = new_candles_from_recycling`.\n\nI'll repeat this loop until `current_new_candles` becomes zero.\n\nI've already run through a few examples in my head, like `a = 4, b = 2` and `a = 6, b = 3`, and the logic seems to be correct based on those traces. I’ve added a trace for the edge case of  `a = 1, b = 1000` to make sure it handles the situation where recycling isn't possible and made sure the solution also works for the other extreme, where recycling is heavily favored (`a = 1000, b = 2`).  I also manually verified the loop for larger values to build confidence.\n\nThe problem input seems to come from `stdin` and needs to handle multiple test cases, where the input lines are of the form \"a b\". And the output should be the `total_hours` for each of these test cases. I'll need to use `sys.stdin` to read the input line by line and the output will be printed to `stdout` with each result on its own line.\n\nGiven the constraints (1 <= a, b <= 1000), this should be pretty efficient, and the iterative approach is optimal in that it directly solves the \"optimal\" problem of extending the burning time as much as possible. I'm going to implement the Python code now, and it should run in near-linear time relative to the number of input sets since recycling always results in some level of candle reduction.\n",
