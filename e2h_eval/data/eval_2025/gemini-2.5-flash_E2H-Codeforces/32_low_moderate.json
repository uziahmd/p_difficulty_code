Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Array Stabilization: My Strategy**\n\nAlright, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Array Stabilization\" problem.  Let's break this down.  The goal is to minimize the *instability* of an array, which is just the difference between its maximum and minimum values, after removing exactly one element.  I see the constraints are reasonable; the array size can be up to 10^5, and the elements themselves are within a reasonable range. That simplifies things.\n\nThe examples they give are crucial for understanding the problem's core.  Seeing how removing either the smallest or largest element affects the instability gives me a good visual. It's clear that to minimize that difference, I need to either shrink the max or increase the min.\n\nThe key insight here is that sorting the array is the way to go. If the array's sorted and indexed from smallest to largest, then removing the smallest value (`s_1`) results in a maximum difference of `s_n - s_2`. Conversely, removing the largest value (`s_n`) gives us a difference of `s_{n-1} - s_1`. Any other value I remove will result in an instability value equal to the original, unsorted instability. So, after sorting, finding the minimum between those two scenarios will give the answer, and a concise solution will reveal itself. This is all solvable in O(n log n) by sorting it. I'll get to it.\n",
