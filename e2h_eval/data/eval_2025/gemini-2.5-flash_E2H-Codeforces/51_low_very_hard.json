Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan for tackling this \"Amusing Joke\" problem.**\n\nFirst, I need to really *get* the problem. Basically, I'm given two names (a guest and a host) and a pile of letters. The goal is to determine if the letters in the pile can be perfectly rearranged to match the combined letters from the two names, without adding or removing any. Essentially, I need to see if the multiset of characters in the pile is identical to the multiset of characters in the two names combined.\n\nNow, for examples, I see the logic is simple:\n\nExample 1 works, all chars are same\n\nExample 2 does not work, because L is more in the pile\n\nExample 3 is similar to the second case, it does not work.\n\nI see that there are two main ways I could approach this:\n\n1.  **Sorting:** I can concatenate the guest and host names, sort the resulting string, and then sort the pile of letters. If the sorted strings are the same, the answer is \"YES\".  This seems pretty easy and efficient for Python.\n\n2.  **Frequency Maps:**  I could build dictionaries to count the occurrences of each character in the combined names and the pile of letters.  Then I'd just need to compare the two dictionaries.  This would be a good approach, and potentially a bit more memory-efficient depending on the data.\n\nConsidering the constraints (uppercase letters, length <= 100), the sorting approach seems like the simplest and most direct way to get this done quickly. I'll stick with that. Let's make this happen!\n",
