They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Path to Solving the \"Playoff\" Problem**\n\nI'm tackling the \"Playoff\" competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out which skill levels can lead a team to victory in this knockout tournament. The core of the problem lies in the structure of the tournament, the outcomes of the games (described by the string *s*), and the fact that we can choose the initial skill level permutation.\n\nTo win, a team needs to win *n* games.  Let's break it down: a team with skill *X* must be able to defeat *n* opponents. The string *s* tells us if *X* needs to have higher or lower skill than its opponent in each round.  A '0' means *X* needs to be lower, and a '1' means *X* needs to be higher.\n\nMy initial thought was that I needed to find a formula relating the string *s* and the possible winning skills. I started by counting the number of '0's (let's call it *c0*) and the number of '1's (*c1*) in the string. Clearly, *c0 + c1 = n*.\n\nTo win, a skill *X* must be higher than *c1* opponents in the games where *s* is '1'.  Therefore, to minimize *X*, I reasoned that *X* must be at least *c1 + 1*. Similarly, it must be lower than *c0* opponents in the games where *s* is '0', so *X* must be at most *2^n - c0*.\n\nThis led me to believe that all skills in the range [*c1 + 1*, *2^n - c0*] were winning skills. However, I kept getting test cases wrong! I realized that my initial reasoning was missing something. The important part is that the skills must be assigned to the teams and that the skills of the other teams on the way to the championship must follow similar constraints.\n\nI re-examined the tournament structure as a binary tree. To be the winner of a single elimination tournament, a team *X* has to eliminate *n* opponents. This means that *X* has to have a distinct skill in the set of skills of its *n* opponents. The skill values $o_1, \\ldots, o_n$ for the opponents as well as $X$ must form a set of $n+1$ distinct values that must be assigned to teams in the initial slots. *X* needs to be greater than *c1* of those values and lower than *c0* of those values.\n\nThinking in terms of the number of teams that must have skills smaller than *X* and greater than *X* gave me more confidence in my formula and I believe it is right! The range of possible winning skills is indeed [*c1 + 1*, *2^n - c0*].\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ such that a team with skill $x$ can win a playoff tournament, given that we can choose the initial permutation of skill levels $p_1, \\dots, p_{2^n}$. The tournament rules are defined by a string $s$ of length $n$: $s_i = '0'$ means in phase $i$ (round with $2^{n-i}$ games), the lower skill team wins; $s_i = '1'$ means the higher skill team wins.\n\nLet $c_1$ be the number of '1's in the string $s$, and $c_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$. Note that $c_1 + c_0 = n$.\n\nConsider a team with skill $X$ that wins the tournament. This team must win $n$ games.\n1. In $c_1$ of these games (where $s_i = '1'$), $X$ must be strictly greater than its opponent.\n2. In $c_0$ of these games (where $s_i = '0'$), $X$ must be strictly smaller than its opponent.\n\nLet $O_1, \\dots, O_n$ be the skill levels of the $n$ opponents that $X$ defeats on its way to championship. All these $n$ opponents must have distinct skill levels, and $X$ must also have a distinct skill level from all of them. So, the set $\\{X, O_1, \\dots, O_n\\}$ contains $n+1$ distinct skill levels.\n\nTo find the minimum possible winning skill $X_{min}$:\n$X$ must be greater than $c_1$ opponents. To minimize $X$, these $c_1$ opponents should have the smallest possible skill values. These values can be $1, 2, \\dots, c_1$. This implies $X \\ge c_1+1$.\nAdditionally, $X$ must be smaller than $c_0$ opponents. These $c_0$ opponents must also be distinct from $X$ and the $c_1$ smaller opponents. To minimize $X$, these $c_0$ opponents should be as small as possible while still being greater than $X$. If $X = c_1+1$, then the smallest available distinct skills greater than $X$ would be $c_1+2, c_1+3, \\dots, c_1+1+c_0$.\nThe maximum skill level required for $X$ and its $n$ opponents would be $c_1+1+c_0 = n+1$. Since $n+1 \\le 2^n$ (for $n \\ge 1$), it is always possible to find $n+1$ distinct skill levels for $X$ and its opponents within the range $[1, 2^n]$.\nTherefore, the minimum possible winning skill is $X_{min} = c_1+1$.\n\nTo find the maximum possible winning skill $X_{max}$:\n$X$ must be smaller than $c_0$ opponents. To maximize $X$, these $c_0$ opponents should have the largest possible skill values. These values can be $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-c_0+1$. This implies $X \\le 2^n-c_0$.\nAdditionally, $X$ must be greater than $c_1$ opponents. These $c_1$ opponents must also be distinct from $X$ and the $c_0$ larger opponents. To maximize $X$, these $c_1$ opponents should be as large as possible while still being smaller than $X$. If $X = 2^n-c_0$, then the largest available distinct skills smaller than $X$ would be $2^n-c_0-1, 2^n-c_0-2, \\dots, 2^n-c_0-c_1$.\nThe minimum skill level required for $X$ and its $n$ opponents would be $2^n-c_0-c_1 = 2^n-n$. Since $2^n-n \\ge 1$ (for $n \\ge 1$), it is always possible to find $n+1$ distinct skill levels for $X$ and its opponents within the range $[1, 2^n]$.\nTherefore, the maximum possible winning skill is $X_{max} = 2^n-c_0$.\n\nThe crucial part is that we can choose the permutation $p$. This means we can assign the skills $1, \\dots, 2^n$ to the initial $2^n$ team slots in any way we want. We can ensure that $X$ and its $n$ direct opponents have specific desired skill values, and all other $2^n - (n+1)$ teams are assigned the remaining skill values such that they are eliminated without affecting $X$'s path or its opponents' abilities to reach their respective matches against $X$. For example, if we need an opponent $O$ to be small, we can assign $O$ and its sub-bracket opponents small values. If we need $O$ to be large, we can assign $O$ and its sub-bracket opponents large values. This flexibility means that the \"winner of a sub-bracket\" constraint doesn't change the bounds for $X$, as long as we have enough distinct skill values available.\n\nThe range of winning integers is thus $[c_1+1, 2^n-c_0]$. All integers $x$ in this range are winning integers.\n\nLet's test with the examples:\n1. $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n   $c_1 = 2$ (for $s_1='1', s_3='1'$), $c_0 = 1$ (for $s_2='0'$).\n   $2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\n   $X_{min} = c_1+1 = 2+1 = 3$.\n   $X_{max} = 2^n-c_0 = 8-1 = 7$.\n   The winning integers are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\n   Example output: $4, 5, 6, 7$.\n   My $X_{min}$ is 3, but example output starts from 4. This indicates there might be an implicit constraint that $X$ must also be greater than some number of other teams not just its direct opponents.\n   The number of teams that are not the champion and not one of its $n$ direct opponents is $2^n - (n+1)$. These $2^n - (n+1)$ teams are eliminated in sub-brackets that do not lead to $X$'s path.\n   The total number of teams that $X$ must be greater than is $c_1$.\n   The total number of teams that $X$ must be smaller than is $c_0$.\n   The number of teams that $X$ does not interact with, and thus can be assigned values without affecting $X$'s direct path, is $2^n - (c_1+c_0+1)$.\n   \n   Let's consider the total number of teams $X$ must dominate. $X$ must be greater than $c_1$ opponents. The other $2^n - (c_1+c_0+1)$ teams can be placed strategically. To minimize $X$, we want to make $X$ as small as possible. The $c_1$ opponents $X$ beats must be smaller than $X$. The $c_0$ opponents $X$ beats must be larger than $X$. The remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ teams can be assigned skills $1, \\dots, 2^n$ in any way.\n   If $s_i = '1'$, $X$ wins by having higher skill. $X$ needs to be greater than $c_1$ opponents.\n   If $s_i = '0'$, $X$ wins by having lower skill. $X$ needs to be smaller than $c_0$ opponents.\n   \n   The crucial insight missing is that for $X$ to win, it must be the highest skill in $c_1$ games and the lowest skill in $c_0$ games.\n   This means $X$ must be greater than $c_1$ distinct values. So $X \\ge c_1+1$.\n   This means $X$ must be smaller than $c_0$ distinct values. So $X \\le 2^n-c_0$.\n   \n   This reasoning is correct for the immediate opponents. However, the problem implies that the *entire permutation* $p$ is chosen.\n   \n   Let's count the number of teams that must be strictly smaller than $X$, and the number of teams that must be strictly larger than $X$.\n   For $X$ to win, it must defeat $c_1$ opponents by being higher-skilled. These are $c_1$ distinct skill values that are smaller than $X$.\n   For $X$ to win, it must defeat $c_0$ opponents by being lower-skilled. These are $c_0$ distinct skill values that are larger than $X$.\n   \n   The minimum winning skill $X_{min}$ is $c_1 + 1$.\n   The maximum winning skill $X_{max}$ is $2^n - c_0$.\n   \n   This is the standard argument for determining the range of a champion's skill. Let's re-verify the example.\n   $n=3, s=\"101\"$. $c_1=2, c_0=1$.\n   $X_{min} = 2+1=3$. $X_{max} = 8-1=7$. Output: $4,5,6,7$.\n   \n   Perhaps the definition of $c_1$ and $c_0$ in the problem refers to something else.\n   \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;\"\n   \"if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\n   \n   The interpretation of $c_1$ as the count of '1's in $s$ and $c_0$ as the count of '0's in $s$ is correct.\n   \n   The example $n=3, s=\"101\"$ output $4,5,6,7$ implies $X_{min}=4$.\n   My formula gives $X_{min}=c_1+1$. If $X_{min}=4$, then $c_1+1=4 \\Rightarrow c_1=3$. But $s=\"101\"$ has $c_1=2$.\n   \n   This suggests that the number of games where a higher skill wins is not simply the count of '1's in $s$.\n   Let $k$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\n   Let $m$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\n   \n   A team that wins $n$ games must defeat $n$ opponents.\n   The total number of teams is $2^n$.\n   The \"lowest\" possible skill value a champion can have is $1 + (\\text{number of } '1's \\text{ in } s)$.\n   The \"highest\" possible skill value a champion can have is $2^n - (\\text{number of } '0's \\text{ in } s)$.\n   This is the standard interpretation.\n   \n   Let's check the problem statement carefully again. \"a permutation of integers 1, 2, ..., $2^n$\".\n   \n   The problem statement is standard. The only way my initial formula is wrong is if $c_1$ and $c_0$ are not simply the counts of '1's and '0's in $s$.\n   No, they are. $s_i$ refers to phase $i$. A winning team plays one game in each phase.\n   \n   The example output for $n=3, s=\"101\"$ is $4, 5, 6, 7$.\n   The minimum winning skill is $2^{c_1}$ and maximum winning skill is $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n   No, this is for a different problem type.\n   \n   Let's reconsider the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n   $c_1=2, c_0=1$.\n   Minimum winning skill: $1 + (\\text{number of } '1's \\text{ in } s \\text{ that are at indices } i \\text{ where } 2^{n-i} \\text{ teams are still in play})$. No, this is too complex.\n   \n   The number of teams that must be strictly smaller than $X$ is $2^{c_1}$.\n   The number of teams that must be strictly larger than $X$ is $2^{c_0}$.\n   \n   Let's re-examine this.\n   If $s_i = '1'$, the higher skill wins.\n   If $s_i = '0'$, the lower skill wins.\n   \n   Consider the total number of teams that *must* be smaller than the champion $X$.\n   In the $c_1$ phases where higher skill wins, $X$ defeats $c_1$ opponents. These $c_1$ opponents must be smaller than $X$.\n   What about the teams these $c_1$ opponents defeated? They are also smaller than $X$.\n   This is the key. The $c_1$ games where $X$ wins by being higher skill, mean $X$ is higher than its opponent. That opponent is a winner of a sub-bracket. That opponent might have won some games by being higher skill and some by being lower skill.\n   \n   This implies that the range is not simply $c_1+1$ to $2^n-c_0$.\n   \n   Consider the number of teams that are \"on the other side\" of the bracket from $X$ (meaning they never play $X$).\n   \n   Let's count the number of '1's in $s$ as `ones_count` and '0's as `zeros_count`.\n   The minimum possible winning skill is $1 + (2^{\\text{ones_count}} - 1)$.\n   The maximum possible winning skill is $2^n - (2^{\\text{zeros_count}} - 1)$.\n   \n   Let's test this formula:\n   1. $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n      `ones_count` = 2. `zeros_count` = 1.\n      $X_{min} = 1 + (2^2 - 1) = 1 + (4-1) = 1+3 = 4$.\n      $X_{max} = 2^3 - (2^1 - 1) = 8 - (2-1) = 8-1 = 7$.\n      Range: $[4, 7]$. This matches the example output ($4, 5, 6, 7$).\n\n   2. $n=1, s=\"1\"$.\n      `ones_count` = 1. `zeros_count` = 0.\n      $X_{min} = 1 + (2^1 - 1) = 1 + (2-1) = 1+1 = 2$.\n      $X_{max} = 2^1 - (2^0 - 1) = 2 - (1-1) = 2-0 = 2$.\n      Range: $[2, 2]$. This matches the example output ($2$).\n\n   3. $n=2, s=\"01\"$.\n      `ones_count` = 1. `zeros_count` = 1.\n      $X_{min} = 1 + (2^1 - 1) = 1 + (2-1) = 1+1 = 2$.\n      $X_{max} = 2^2 - (2^1 - 1) = 4 - (2-1) = 4-1 = 3$.\n      Range: $[2, 3]$. This matches the example output ($2, 3$).\n\nThis formula seems correct. Let's try to justify it.\nIf $X$ wins, it must win $n$ games.\nIn the $c_1$ games where $s_i='1'$, $X$ must be greater than its opponent.\nIn the $c_0$ games where $s_i='0'$, $X$ must be smaller than its opponent.\n\nConsider $X_{min}$. $X$ must be greater than its $c_1$ opponents. Each of these opponents is a winner of a sub-bracket.\nIf $s_i='1'$, $X$ beats $O$. $O$ is a winner of a sub-bracket.\nIf $s_i='0'$, $X$ beats $O$. $O$ is a winner of a sub-bracket.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that *must* be smaller than $X$.\n$X$ is the champion.\nIn the $c_1$ games where $X$ wins by having higher skill, $X$ defeats $c_1$ opponents. Let these opponents be $O_1, \\dots, O_{c_1}$.\nThese $c_1$ opponents, along with all the teams they defeated in their respective sub-brackets, must all be smaller than $X$.\nEach $O_j$ is a winner of a sub-bracket. The total number of teams in the sub-bracket that $O_j$ won depends on which phase $j$ occurred.\nThis is getting complicated. The simpler argument:\nTo win, $X$ needs to defeat $c_1$ opponents by being higher skill. These $c_1$ opponents are themselves champions of sub-tournaments.\nTo minimize $X$, we want these $c_1$ opponents to be as small as possible.\nIf $X$ wins a game where $s_i='1'$, $X$ is greater than its opponent $O$. $O$ is the winner of a sub-tournament. To make $O$ as small as possible, we can assign $O$ and its sub-bracket opponents the lowest available values.\nThe crucial part is that $X$ needs to be greater than $2^{c_1}-1$ other teams.\nWhy $2^{c_1}-1$? Suppose $s$ has $c_1$ ones. This means $X$ is the highest skill in $c_1$ games.\nThis implies $X$ is higher than its $c_1$ opponents.\nBut also, these $c_1$ opponents are winners of their sub-brackets.\nIf $s_i='1'$, $X$ beats $O$. $O$ is the winner of a sub-bracket.\nIf $s_i='0'$, $X$ beats $O$. $O$ is the winner of a sub-bracket.\nThe $c_1$ opponents that $X$ beats by being higher skill are themselves winners of their sub-brackets.\nTo make $X$ win by being higher skill, $X$ must be greater than its opponent $O$.\nThe opponent $O$ must have won its own sub-bracket.\nIf $s_i='1'$, $X$ wins. $X$ must be greater than its opponent.\nIf $s_i='0'$, $X$ wins. $X$ must be smaller than its opponent.\n\nLet $k$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nLet $m$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\nTo win the tournament, a team must defeat $k$ opponents by having a higher skill and $m$ opponents by having a lower skill.\nThe minimum skill value a champion can have is $1 + (2^k - 1) = 2^k$.\nThe maximum skill value a champion can have is $2^n - (2^m - 1) = 2^n - 2^m + 1$.\n\nJustification:\nConsider the minimum skill $X_{min}$. $X$ must win $k$ games where $s_i='1'$. This means $X$ must be greater than its $k$ opponents. Let's call these $O_1, \\dots, O_k$.\nThese $k$ opponents are themselves winners of sub-brackets. For $X$ to be minimal, we want $O_j$ to be as small as possible.\nThe minimum skill for a winner of a sub-bracket depends on the rules for that sub-bracket.\nHowever, we are free to assign the permutation.\nThe $k$ opponents $X$ beats (by being higher skill) must be distinct values smaller than $X$.\nThe $m$ opponents $X$ beats (by being lower skill) must be distinct values larger than $X$.\nThe minimum set of values needed for $X$ to win is $X$ itself, $2^k-1$ values smaller than $X$, and $2^m-1$ values larger than $X$. No, this is incorrect.\n\nThe $2^k-1$ comes from the fact that $X$ needs to be the highest of $2^k$ teams in a sub-bracket where all games are decided by higher skill winning.\nIf $s$ contains $k$ ones, then $X$ must be greater than $k$ opponents.\nThe total number of teams $X$ must be greater than is $2^k-1$.\nThis is because if $X$ is to win $k$ games as the higher skill, then in its sub-bracket of $2^k$ initial teams (assuming all $k$ '1's are for these games), $X$ would be the maximum.\nFor example, if $s=\"11\"$, $k=2$. $X$ wins 2 games as higher skill.\nPhase 1 ($s_1='1'$): $X$ vs $O_1$. $X > O_1$.\nPhase 2 ($s_2='1'$): $X$ vs $O_2$. $X > O_2$.\n$O_1$ is a winner of a sub-bracket. $O_2$ is a winner of a sub-bracket.\nIn this case, $X$ needs to be higher than $O_1$ and $O_2$. Also, $O_1$ must be higher than its opponent, and $O_2$ must be higher than its opponent.\nThe set of skills that $X$ must be higher than consists of $2^k-1$ skills.\nThis means $X$ must be at least $2^k$.\nSimilarly, $X$ must be smaller than $2^m-1$ skills. This means $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^m-1)$.\n\nThe number of '1's in $s$ is `ones_count`.\nThe number of '0's in $s$ is `zeros_count`.\nThe minimum winning skill is $2^{\\text{ones_count}}$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - 2^{\\text{zeros_count}} + 1$.\n\nFinal check with the examples:\n1. $n=3, s=\"101\"$. `ones_count`=2, `zeros_count`=1. $2^n=8$.\n   $X_{min} = 2^2 = 4$.\n   $X_{max} = 2^3 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\n   Output: $4, 5, 6, 7$. Matches.\n\n2. $n=1, s=\"1\"$. `ones_count`=1, `zeros_count`=0. $2^n=2$.\n   $X_{min} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   $X_{max} = 2^1 - 2^0 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$.\n   Output: $2$. Matches.\n\n3. $n=2, s=\"01\"$. `ones_count`=1, `zeros_count`=1. $2^n=4$.\n   $X_{min} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   $X_{max} = 2^2 - 2^1 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3$.\n   Output: $2, 3$. Matches.\n\nThis formula seems robust and matches all examples.\n\nImplementation:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count `ones_count` and `zeros_count`.\n4. Calculate $X_{min} = 2^{\\text{ones_count}}$.\n5. Calculate $X_{max} = 2^n - 2^{\\text{zeros_count}} + 1$.\n6. Print integers from $X_{min}$ to $X_{max}$ inclusive, separated by spaces.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    ones_count = s.count('1')\n    zeros_count = s.count('0')\n\n    # Calculate 2^n\n    total_teams = 1 << n\n\n    # Calculate minimum winning skill\n    # If a team wins 'ones_count' games by being higher skill,\n    # it must be greater than 2^ones_count - 1 other teams.\n    # So, its minimum skill must be 2^ones_count.\n    min_winning_skill = 1 << ones_count\n\n    # Calculate maximum winning skill\n    # If a team wins 'zeros_count' games by being lower skill,\n    # it must be smaller than 2^zeros_count - 1 other teams.\n    # So, its maximum skill must be total_teams - (2^zeros_count - 1)\n    max_winning_skill = total_teams - ( (1 << zeros_count) - 1 )\n\n    # Generate and print the winning integers\n    winning_integers = [str(x) for x in range(min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill + 1)]\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(winning_integers) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
