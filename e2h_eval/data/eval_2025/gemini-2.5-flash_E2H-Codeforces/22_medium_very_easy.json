After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey for the \"Marks\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core of this \"Marks\" problem seems straightforward: identify successful students based on their subject marks. First, I'll need to read in the input: the number of students (`n`), the number of subjects (`m`), and the marks themselves, represented as a grid. I'll represent this grid as a 2D list of integers for easier access. The key is defining what makes a student \"successful\": they must be the best at *at least one* subject. Being the best means getting the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nTo approach this, I'll first find the maximum mark for each subject. I can do this by iterating through the gradebook column-wise (subject by subject) and keeping track of the highest mark encountered. This maximum mark will be stored in a list called `max_marks_per_subject`. Now, comes the student evaluation. I'll go through each student and then each subject, comparing their mark in that subject to the maximum mark for that subject, using a set for the successful students' indices to avoid duplicates. Once I find that a student is the best in *any* subject, I can mark them as successful and move on to the next student for optimization.\n\nAfter going through all students and subjects, the size of the set will be the number of successful students. Finally, I'll print that number. Looking at the constraints, the `O(n*m)` time complexity is acceptable. For the implementation, I will use `sys.stdin.readline()` and `sys.stdout.write()` to speed up the input/output processes and `strip()` to remove unwanted newline characters for correct data handling. The logic seems clear, the algorithm efficient, and the edge cases seem to be handled. I am confident in the solution.\n",
