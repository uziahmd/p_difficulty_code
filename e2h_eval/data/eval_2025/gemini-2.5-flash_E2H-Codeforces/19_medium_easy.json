The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games.

    "thought": "**Maximizing Fan Count in a Tree**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem. The goal is to pick `n - k` districts out of `n` total districts. These selected districts need to be connected after removing `k` districts, and we want to maximize the total \"fan count,\" where a district's fan count is `2` raised to the power of its index.\n\nThis setup screams \"tree\" because it describes `n` districts and `n-1` paths, meaning there's exactly one path between every two districts.  We're basically working with a tree structure. The core challenge is: given a tree, find the largest connected subgraph by fan count when removing `k` nodes. Since higher-indexed districts have more fans (`2^i`), we want to keep districts with larger indices whenever possible.\n\nInitially, I thought about removing nodes with smaller indices, minimizing what's removed. That sounds like a greedy strategy, but it's more subtle than just removing low-index nodes, we need to ensure the remaining nodes stay connected.\n\nThen it clicked:  We want to find a connected subgraph of size `n - k` with the highest possible fan count, which translates to finding the *k* nodes to remove so that the fan count of the rest is maximized.  The problem implicitly gives us a hint. The problem states that \"all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another\". This just means that the subgraph induced on the remaining nodes must be connected.\n\nThe key insight is that this is equivalent to finding a *subtree* of size `n - k`. If we pick a set of `n - k` nodes that are connected, it must be a subtree of the original tree. This makes things much cleaner. We're looking for an `n - k` sized subtree with the highest total fan count.  Since larger indices equal higher fan counts, we want to start with the largest index, `n`.\n\nSo, the strategy is this: start with node `n`, the one that provides the maximum number of fans (as 2^n will be the largest power of 2 for a given `n`). Then, we need to add `n - k - 1` more nodes while keeping it connected, always adding the node with the highest index that's adjacent to the current connected subgraph. This guarantees a connected subgraph and maximizes our fan count.\n\nThis greedy approach means we add a new vertex with the highest index adjacent to a node already in our set at each step until we build a connected subtree of size `n-k`.\n\nNow, does this greedy approach *always* work? It turns out, yes, because in a tree, the optimal solution must contain the largest-weighted node if the weights are distinct and positive. The number of fans (power of 2) makes this weight distinct and strictly increasing with the index. So, keeping the `n` node is a must, and our greedy strategy will always include the `n` node.\n\nThis leads to the algorithm:\n1.  Initialize with node `n`.\n2.  Iteratively add neighbors with the largest indices to `kept_nodes` until the set has `n - k` nodes.\n\nThe implementation involves an adjacency list to represent the tree and a priority queue to efficiently find neighbors with the largest indices.  The time complexity is `O(N log N)`, which is reasonable for the given constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n - k` districts to participate in The Number Games such that:\n1. The selected districts form a connected component in the original graph (which is a tree).\n2. The total number of fans of the participating contestants is maximized. The number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`.\n\nTo maximize the total number of fans `sum(2^i)`, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices, as `2^i` grows exponentially with `i`.\n\nThe problem can be rephrased as finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that maximizes the sum of `2^i` for its nodes. A key property for such problems on trees with positive weights is that the optimal connected subgraph must include the node with the absolute maximum weight. In this case, node `n` has the highest fan count (`2^n`). Therefore, any optimal set of `n-k` districts must include district `n`.\n\nThis leads to a greedy strategy:\n1. Start by including district `n` in our set of `kept_nodes`.\n2. Repeatedly add `n-k-1` more districts to `kept_nodes`. In each step, choose an unkept district that is adjacent to any district already in `kept_nodes`, and has the largest possible district number (highest fan count). This ensures we maintain connectivity and maximize the sum of fans.\n\nThis strategy is known to find the maximum weight connected subgraph of a fixed size in a tree. The set of `kept_nodes` will always form a connected subgraph (a subtree) because we only add nodes adjacent to existing kept nodes.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Build Adjacency List:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list.\n2.  **Initialize:**\n    *   `is_kept`: A boolean array of size `n+1`, initialized to `False`. `is_kept[i]` will be `True` if district `i` is selected.\n    *   `pq`: A min-priority queue (using Python's `heapq` module). We'll store `(-district_number, district_number)` tuples to simulate a max-priority queue based on `district_number`.\n    *   `num_kept`: An integer counter, initialized to `0`.\n3.  **Start with District `n`:**\n    *   Set `is_kept[n] = True`.\n    *   Increment `num_kept` to `1`.\n    *   Add all neighbors of `n` (that are not `n` itself) to `pq`. For each neighbor `v`, push `(-v, v)` onto `pq`.\n4.  **Greedy Expansion:**\n    *   While `num_kept < n - k`:\n        *   If `pq` is empty, it means we cannot add more nodes while maintaining connectivity, which should not happen under the problem constraints as long as `num_kept < n-k`.\n        *   Pop the district `u` with the largest index from `pq` (i.e., `(-u, u)` from the min-heap).\n        *   If `is_kept[u]` is already `True` (this can happen if `u` was a neighbor of multiple nodes already in `kept_nodes` and was pushed multiple times), skip this `u` and continue to the next iteration.\n        *   Set `is_kept[u] = True`.\n        *   Increment `num_kept`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n            *   If `is_kept[v]` is `False`, push `(-v, v)` onto `pq`.\n5.  **Identify Removed Districts:**\n    *   After the loop, iterate from `1` to `n`. Any district `i` for which `is_kept[i]` is `False` is a removed district. Collect these into a list.\n6.  **Output:** Print the collected removed districts, space-separated and in increasing order. The list will naturally contain exactly `k` elements.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time:** Building the adjacency list takes `O(N)` time. The greedy expansion phase processes each node and edge at most a constant number of times (each node is added to `kept_nodes` once, each edge causes at most two pushes to `pq`). Each push/pop operation on the priority queue takes `O(log N)` time. Thus, the total time complexity is `O(N log N)`. Given `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is approximately `2 * 10^7`, which is efficient enough.\n*   **Space:** `O(N)` for the adjacency list, `is_kept` array, and the priority queue.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n=6, k=3`. We need to keep `n-k = 3` districts.\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\n\n1.  **Adjacency List:**\n    `1: [2]`\n    `2: [1, 6, 4, 3]`\n    `3: [2]`\n    `4: [2]`\n    `5: [6]`\n    `6: [2, 5]`\n2.  **Initialize:** `is_kept = [F]*7`, `pq = []`, `num_kept = 0`.\n3.  **Start with `n=6`:**\n    *   `is_kept[6] = T`, `num_kept = 1`.\n    *   Neighbors of 6: `2, 5`. Neither is kept.\n    *   `heapq.heappush(pq, (-2, 2))`, `heapq.heappush(pq, (-5, 5))`.\n    *   `pq` is now `[(-5, 5), (-2, 2)]` (order might vary, but `-5` is smallest, so `5` is highest priority).\n4.  **Greedy Expansion (`num_kept < 3`):**\n    *   **Iteration 1:** `num_kept = 1`.\n        *   Pop `(-5, 5)`. `u = 5`. `is_kept[5]` is `F`.\n        *   `is_kept[5] = T`, `num_kept = 2`.\n        *   Neighbors of 5: `6`. `is_kept[6]` is `T`. No new pushes to `pq`.\n        *   `pq` is now `[(-2, 2)]`.\n    *   **Iteration 2:** `num_kept = 2`.\n        *   Pop `(-2, 2)`. `u = 2`. `is_kept[2]` is `F`.\n        *   `is_kept[2] = T`, `num_kept = 3`.\n        *   Neighbors of 2: `1, 6, 4, 3`.\n            *   `is_kept[1]` is `F`. Push `(-1, 1)`.\n            *   `is_kept[6]` is `T`. Skip.\n            *   `is_kept[4]` is `F`. Push `(-4, 4)`.\n            *   `is_kept[3]` is `F`. Push `(-3, 3)`.\n        *   `pq` is now `[(-4, 4), (-3, 3), (-1, 1)]` (logical order, `(-4,4)` is top).\n5.  **Loop ends** because `num_kept = 3` is not less than `n-k = 3`.\n6.  **Identify Removed Districts:**\n    *   `is_kept` is `[F, F, T, F, F, T, T]` (for indices 0 to 6).\n    *   Districts `1, 3, 4` are not kept.\n7.  **Output:** `1 3 4`\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Adjacency list for the tree\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # is_kept[i] will be True if district i is kept, False otherwise\n    is_kept = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # Priority queue to store candidate nodes to add to the kept set.\n    # We use a min-heap, so we store (-index, index) to simulate a max-heap on index.\n    pq = []\n\n    # Start with the node n, as it has the highest fan count (2^n) and must be in the optimal set.\n    is_kept[n] = True\n    num_kept = 1\n\n    # Add neighbors of n to the priority queue\n    for neighbor in adj[n]:\n        # No need to check if neighbor is already kept, as only 'n' is kept initially\n        heapq.heappush(pq, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n\n    # Keep adding nodes until we have n-k nodes\n    # We need to keep (n - k) nodes in total.\n    # Since we already have 'n' in kept_nodes, we need to add (n - k - 1) more nodes if n-k > 0.\n    # The loop condition `num_kept < n - k` correctly handles cases where n-k = 1 (loop doesn't run).\n    while num_kept < n - k:\n        # If the priority queue becomes empty before reaching n-k nodes,\n        # it implies the graph is not connected or n-k is too large.\n        # Given problem constraints (tree, k < n), this case should not be reached\n        # as long as num_kept < n-k and the graph is connected.\n        if not pq:\n            break \n        \n        # Get the node with the highest index from the priority queue\n        neg_u, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        \n        # If u is already kept, skip it.
