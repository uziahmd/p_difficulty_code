Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Amusing Joke\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tasked with writing a Python script to solve this \"Amusing Joke\" problem. My initial thought process is to break it down systematically.  First, I need to understand the problem fully.  It seems we're given three strings: a guest name, a host name, and a pile of letters.  The core question is whether the letters in the pile are *exactly* the letters from the guest name and host name, rearranged. It's essentially a character frequency matching problem, alongside a length check.\n\nEssentially, I need to verify two things:\n\n1.  **Character Counts:** The frequency of each letter (A-Z) in the pile must be equal to the *sum* of the frequencies of that letter in the guest name and host name.  This needs to hold true for *every* letter.\n2.  **String Length:** The total length of the pile should be equal to the combined length of the guest name and the host name. This is a crucial, easily overlooked, check.\n\nI'm thinking a character count approach will be the most efficient. I can iterate through each string, build character frequency maps (perhaps using dictionaries in Python), and then compare the counts.\n\nNow, let's look at the given examples.  The first example, with \"SANTACLAUS\", \"DEDMOROZ\", and \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\", is straightforward. I create the combined name, count characters, and compare with the actual pile.  The counts for each character match, and the lengths match, leading to \"YES\".\n\nIn the second example, \"PAPAINOEL\", \"JOULUPUKKI\", and \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\", the character counts *don't* match for letters 'L' and 'P'. This indicates \"NO\", even though the lengths are the same. This confirms the importance of checking *both* character counts and total string length.\n\nSo, my strategy is clear:  build frequency maps, perform count comparisons, and include a length check as the final gate. A clean and efficient Python script should be easy to create from this thought process.\n",
