The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Algorithm for Xenia and Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to solve the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break this down to its core. We have a ring road with `n` houses, numbered 1 to `n`. Xenia has `m` tasks, each requiring her to be at a specific house (`a_i`). The road is one-way, clockwise, and moving between adjacent houses takes one time unit. Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in order. We need the minimum total time.\n\nEssentially, I need to trace Xenia's movements. She starts at house 1, and the total time starts at 0. For each task, I need to figure out the most efficient clockwise path from her current house to the target house for that task.\n\nThe crucial part is calculating the time for each move. If the target house (`a_i`) is further along the ring from her current house, it's a simple subtraction: `target_house - current_house`. But if the target is before her current house (clockwise), it gets more complex. I'll need to account for wrapping around the ring: the time would be  `n - current_house + target_house`.\n\nSo, for each task, I'll calculate the time to get to that house and add it to the total time. I'll keep track of the previous task's house to determine the current travel time.\n\nFor the first task, `prev_task_house` starts at 1. Then I just calculate the time for each task based on this simple logic:\n\nIf `current_task_house >= prev_task_house`: `time_taken = current_task_house - prev_task_house`\nElse (`current_task_house < prev_task_house`): `time_taken = n - prev_task_house + current_task_house`\n\nThen, I'll update `total_time` and `prev_task_house` and repeat. Looks pretty straightforward. I think I'm ready to code.\n",
