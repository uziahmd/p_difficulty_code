Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Strategic Thinking for the \"Colored Boots\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Colored Boots\" problem, and my initial thought is, this seems like a bipartite matching problem. We've got *n* left boots and *n* right boots, each with a color, and we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs. The rules are pretty straightforward: exact color matches are good, and question marks ('?') are wildcards.\n\nMy first instinct is to think about a graph where left boots are on one side, right boots on the other, and edges represent compatibility. Then, find the maximum matching. However, the constraint on *n* (up to 150,000) makes me pause. A standard bipartite matching algorithm, like Hopcroft-Karp, would be too slow with that many nodes. It's O(E*sqrt(V)), where E can be O(N^2) in the worst case - that's going to be too slow.\n\nSo, I need to come up with a more clever, possibly greedy, approach.  The key seems to be figuring out the *right* order to process the boots. I think it's all about prioritizing the most restrictive matches first. I'm thinking,  the most crucial matches are the exact matches --  specific color to the *same* specific color. If a left boot is 'f' and a right boot is also 'f', that's a perfect match. If I don't pair them, those specific colors might get mismatched, leading to suboptimal pairing. I think I'll start there.\n\nMy current line of thought is to iterate through the exact matches first. Then, if there are unmatched boots remaining (with question marks or specific colors), I can try to pair them with the question mark boots. It's a greedy approach, but prioritizing the exact matches seems like a good strategy for maximizing the pairs. I'll need to figure out how to efficiently track which boots are already paired and how to handle the question mark boots. This sounds like it could be a winner.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots and to list these pairs. A boot can be used in at most one pair. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color '?' is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nThis problem can be solved with a greedy approach. The key idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive, as this leaves the more flexible '?' boots available for other matches.\n\nLet's store the indices of boots for each color. We can use lists of indices for each character 'a' through 'z', and for '?'.\n`left_boots[char_code]` will store a list of 0-indexed indices of left boots with color `char_code`.\n`right_boots[char_code]` will store a list of 0-indexed indices of right boots with color `char_code`.\nFor example, `left_boots[0]` for 'a', `left_boots[1]` for 'b', ..., `left_boots[25]` for 'z', and `left_boots[26]` for '?'.\n\nThe greedy strategy proceeds in three steps:\n\n**Step 1: Match specific colors with identical specific colors.**\nIterate through all specific colors 'a' through 'z'. For each color `c`:\nMatch as many left boots of color `c` with right boots of color `c` as possible.\nThis means taking the minimum of `len(left_boots[c])` and `len(right_boots[c])` pairs.\nAdd these pairs to our result list. Remove the used boots from their respective lists.\n\n**Step 2: Match remaining specific colors with '?' boots.**\nAfter Step 1, any specific color boots remaining in `left_boots[c]` or `right_boots[c]` could not find an exact match. Now, we try to match them with '?' boots.\nIt's generally better to use '?' boots for specific colors first, as '?' boots are the most flexible.\nFirst, match any remaining left boots of specific colors with right '?' boots:\nIterate through specific colors `c` from 'a' to 'z'. For each `c`:\nMatch as many remaining left boots of color `c` with right '?' boots as possible.\nAdd these pairs to the result list. Remove the used boots.\n\nThen, match any remaining right boots of specific colors with left '?' boots:\nIterate through specific colors `c` from 'a' to 'z'. For each `c`:\nMatch as many remaining right boots of color `c` with left '?' boots as possible.\nAdd these pairs to the result list. Remove the used boots.\n\n**Step 3: Match remaining '?' boots with '?' boots.**\nFinally, any remaining left '?' boots can only be matched with remaining right '?' boots.\nMatch as many left '?' boots with right '?' boots as possible.\nAdd these pairs to the result list.\n\n**Why this greedy strategy works:**\n- **Step 1 (c-c matches):** These are the most restrictive matches. If a left boot `L_i` of color `c` and a right boot `R_j` of color `c` are not paired, `L_i` would either need another `c` right boot or a `?` right boot. Similarly for `R_j`. By pairing `L_i` and `R_j`, we satisfy two boots with their most restrictive match. This doesn't prevent any other potential matches that couldn't be satisfied otherwise, because `c-c` is the only way for two specific `c` boots to match without involving a `?`.\n- **Step 2 (c-? matches):** After `c-c` matches, if a `c` boot remains, its only compatible partners are `?` boots. Using a `?` boot for a specific color `c` is generally better than saving it for another `?` boot, because `?` boots are more versatile. If we save a `?` boot, it might be used for another `?` boot (a `?-?` match). But a `c` boot *must* use a `?` or another `c` boot. Since `c` boots are exhausted, `?` is the only option. Prioritizing `c-?` matches ensures that specific boots, which have fewer matching options, are satisfied first.\n- **Step 3 (?-? matches):** At this point, only `?` boots remain. They can only match with other `?` boots. We pair as many as possible.\n\nThis greedy approach ensures that boots with fewer matching options are prioritized, leading to the maximum number of pairs.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Use a list of lists (or `collections.defaultdict(list)`) to store indices for each color.\n- Convert character colors to integer indices (e.g., `ord(c) - ord('a')` for 'a'-'z', and `26` for '?').\n- When adding pairs, remember to use 1-based indexing for output.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem statement):**\n`n = 10`\n`l = \"codeforces\"`\n`r = \"dodivthree\"`\n\nInitialize `left_boots` and `right_boots` (using 0-indexed lists for 'a'-'z', 26 for '?'):\n`left_boots`:\n  `'c'`: [0]\n  `'o'`: [1]\n  `'d'`: [2]\n  `'e'`: [3, 7]\n  `'f'`: [4]\n  `'r'`: [5]\n  `'s'`: [6]\n  `'c'`: [8]\n  `'e'`: [9]\n`right_boots`:\n  `'d'`: [0]\n  `'o'`: [1]\n  `'d'`: [2]\n  `'i'`: [3]\n  `'v'`: [4]\n  `'t'`: [5]\n  `'h'`: [6]\n  `'r'`: [7]\n  `'e'`: [8]\n  `'e'`: [9]\n\nCorrected `left_boots` and `right_boots` after parsing:\n`left_boots`:\n  `'c'`: [0, 8]\n  `'o'`: [1]\n  `'d'`: [2]\n  `'e'`: [3, 7]\n  `'f'`: [4]\n  `'r'`: [5]\n  `'s'`: [6]\n`right_boots`:\n  `'d'`: [0, 2]\n  `'o'`: [1]\n  `'i'`: [3]\n  `'v'`: [4]\n  `'t'`: [5]\n  `'h'`: [6]\n  `'r'`: [7]\n  `'e'`: [8, 9]\n\nLet's re-parse `l` and `r` carefully:\n`l`: `c(0) o(1) d(2) e(3) f(4) o(5) r(6) c(7) e(8) s(9)`\n`r`: `d(0) o(1) d(2) i(3) v(4) t(5) h(6) r(7) e(8) e(9)`\n\n`left_boots`:\n  `'c'`: [0, 7]\n  `'o'`: [1, 5]\n  `'d'`: [2]\n  `'e'`: [3, 8]\n  `'f'`: [4]\n  `'r'`: [6]\n  `'s'`: [9]\n`right_boots`:\n  `'d'`: [0, 2]\n  `'o'`: [1]\n  `'i'`: [3]\n  `'v'`: [4]\n  `'t'`: [5]\n  `'h'`: [6]\n  `'r'`: [7]\n  `'e'`: [8, 9]\n\n**Step 1: Specific-specific matches**\n- 'c': `left_c`=[0,7], `right_c`=[] -> 0 pairs\n- 'd': `left_d`=[2], `right_d`=[0,2] -> 1 pair: (2,0). `left_d`=[], `right_d`=[2]\n- 'e': `left_e`=[3,8], `right_e`=[8,9] -> 2 pairs: (3,8), (8,9). `left_e`=[], `right_e`=[]\n- 'o': `left_o`=[1,5], `right_o`=[1] -> 1 pair: (1,1). `left_o`=[5], `right_o`=[]\n- 'r': `left_r`=[6], `right_r`=[7] -> 1 pair: (6,7). `left_r`=[], `right_r`=[]\nTotal pairs: 1+2+1+1 = 5 pairs.\nPairs: (2,0), (3,8), (8,9), (1,1), (6,7)\nRemaining boots (specific colors):\n`left_boots`:\n  `'c'`: [0, 7]\n  `'o'`: [5]\n  `'f'`: [4]\n  `'s'`: [9]\n`right_boots`:\n  `'d'`: [2]\n  `'i'`: [3]\n  `'v'`: [4]\n  `'t'`: [5]\n  `'h'`: [6]\n(No '?' boots in this example)\n\n**Step 2: Specific-? matches**\nN/A as there are no '?' boots.\n\n**Step 3: ?-? matches**\nN/A as there are no '?' boots.\n\nFinal pairs: 5.\n(2,0), (3,8), (8,9), (1,1), (6,7)\nOutput 1-indexed:\n3 1\n4 9\n9 10\n2 2\n7 8\n\nThis matches the example output (order might differ).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store indices for each color.\n    # 0-25 for 'a'-'z', 26 for '?'.\n    left_boots = [[] for _ in range(27)]\n    right_boots = [[] for _ in range(27)]\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l_str[i] == '?':\n            left_boots[26].append(i + 1)  # Use 1-based indexing for output\n        else:\n            left_boots[ord(l_str[i]) - ord('a')].append(i + 1)\n\n        if r_str[i] == '?':\n            right_boots[26].append(i + 1)\n        else:\n            right_boots[ord(r_str[i]) - ord('a')].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors with identical specific colors (c-c)\n    for i in range(26):  # For 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_boots[i] and right_boots[i]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[i].pop(), right_boots[i].pop()))\n\n    # Step 2: Match remaining specific colors with '?' boots (c-?)\n    # Match left specific boots with right '?' boots\n    for i in range(26):  # For 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_boots[i] and right_boots[26]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[i].pop(), right_boots[26].pop()))\n    \n    # Match right specific boots with left '?' boots\n    for i in range(26):  # For 'a' through 'z'\n        while right_boots[i] and left_boots[26]:\n            pairs.append((left_boots[26].pop(), right_boots[i].pop()))\n\n    # Step 3: Match remaining '?' boots with '?' boots (?-?)\n    while left_boots[26] and right_boots[26]:\n        pairs.append((left_boots[26].pop(), right_boots[26].pop()))\n\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"{len(pairs)}\\n\")\n    for l_idx, r_idx in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
