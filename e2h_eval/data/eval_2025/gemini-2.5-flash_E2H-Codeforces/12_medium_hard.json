The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving Xenia and Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break it down:  There's a circular road with houses numbered 1 to *n*, and *m* tasks to complete. Each task requires Xenia (who starts at house 1) to go to a specific house, *a<sub>i</sub>*, in order, and we need to minimize the total time. Movement is clockwise and takes one unit of time per house.\n\nThe core idea is to simulate Xenia's movements. I'll keep track of `current_house` and `total_time`. Initially, `current_house` is 1 and `total_time` is 0. Then, for each task, I calculate the time to move to *a<sub>i</sub>*.\n\nThe tricky part is calculating the time for each move. If *a<sub>i</sub>* is greater than or equal to `current_house`, it's a simple subtraction (*a<sub>i</sub>* - `current_house`). But, if *a<sub>i</sub>* is less than `current_house`, she wraps around the circle. That's `n - current_house + a_i`. This formula correctly accounts for the wrap-around, by calculating how far from the `current_house` to `n` and `n` to *a<sub>i</sub>*.\n\nI've tested this logic with examples, and it seems to hold. The constraints on *n* and *m* are relatively large (up to 10<sup>5</sup>), so I will use a 64-bit integer, but Python's integer handling is automatic, so no overflow concerns.\n\nThe solution iterates through the tasks in O(m) time. Inside the loop are a constant number of arithmetic operations. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m). The space complexity is also O(m) (to hold the list of houses, *a<sub>i</sub>*). The input/output will use `sys.stdin.readline` and `sys.stdout.write` for fast I/O.\n\nOkay, I have a working Python script ready. It accurately simulates the moves and calculates the minimum time. I'll make sure there are no unnecessary comments to meet the problem instructions, then submit.\n",
