Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Road to 1600 Problem: A Quest for a Python Solution**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this \"Road to 1600\" problem. The core task is to create an *N x N* board filled with numbers from 1 to *N*<sup>2</sup>, with a moving piece (rook or queen) navigating the board according to specific rules. I need to find a board configuration where the rook pays strictly fewer \"vuns\" (teleportation fees) than the queen. If such a board doesn't exist, I should output `-1`. The constraint on *N* is up to 500, which suggests I need an efficient solution.\n\nMy initial thoughts are centered around problem decomposition and edge cases. For *N = 1*, the board is just `[1]`. Both rook and queen start at `1` and there are no moves or teleports.  This means both pay 0 vuns. That condition doesn't meet the \"strictly less\" requirement. So *N=1* definitely should return `-1`.\n\nNow, let's explore *N = 2*.  I'm getting a hunch this is going to be tricky. The rook can only move horizontally or vertically, while the queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. My thinking is that the queen *always* has at least as many move options as the rook. Since we are picking the move to the smallest *unvisited* cell, the queen can reach every position the rook can. The crucial point here is whether the queen can teleport when the rook cannot.\n\nI'm starting to think about situations where the rook gets \"stuck\" - no unvisited cells in its row or column. In these cases, it *has* to teleport. The queen, however, might still have diagonal moves to unvisited cells. But, if the rook is \"stuck,\" it means every cell in its row and column is visited.  This also means the queen is effectively blocked as well. Any diagonal move would be blocked by other cells which had been visited.\n\nLet me reread that key rule about vuns again. It is payed when the following is true.\n\n1.  There are still unvisited cells.\n2.  All accessible cells have been visited.\n\nI'm now thinking through this. If the rook is teleporting, it *must* mean all cells it can access (in its row/column) are visited. If those cells are visited, then the queen (able to reach these and also any others) will be similarly blocked.\n\nEssentially, if the rook pays a vun, it means the queen is also blocked, and must teleport. So, the queen would have to teleport at *least* as much as the rook, and I don't see any scenarios where a queen would pay fewer vuns than the rook.  It feels like it's impossible for the rook to pay strictly fewer vuns.  I'm leaning towards the conclusion that there might be no solution for any *N*.  I'm going to formulate a clear hypothesis and try to prove this, since this problem isn't looking as simple as it initially appeared. This will be my next step: solidify my logic and then perhaps try to write a program to brute-force a few cases to test my hypothesis.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to construct an `N x N` board with numbers from `1` to `N*N` such that a rook pays strictly fewer vuns than a queen, or determine if it's impossible.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for paying a vun:\nA piece pays a vun if:\n1. There are still unvisited cells on the board.\n2. All cells reachable by the piece in one move from its current position are already visited.\nIf these conditions are met, the piece teleports to the smallest unvisited number on the board and pays 1 vun. Otherwise, it moves to the smallest unvisited number reachable in one move.\n\nConsider the movement capabilities: A queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. A rook can only move horizontally and vertically. This means any cell reachable by a rook is also reachable by a queen. Therefore, the set of cells a queen can reach is always a superset (or equal) of the cells a rook can reach.\n\nLet's denote `R_cost` as the vuns paid by the rook and `Q_cost` as the vuns paid by the queen. We need `R_cost < Q_cost`.\n\nSuppose at some point, the rook pays a vun. This means all cells in its current row and column are visited. Since the queen can reach any cell a rook can, and potentially more (diagonally), it's impossible for the queen to *not* pay a vun if the rook pays one at the same step, unless the queen has an additional diagonal move available to an unvisited cell. If the queen *does* have such a move, it will take it instead of paying a vun. This implies `Q_cost <= R_cost` at any given step.\nTherefore, it seems impossible for the rook to pay strictly less vuns than the queen. The queen will always have at least as many options as the rook, so if the rook has to pay a vun, the queen either also has to pay a vun (if all its reachable cells are visited), or it can make a move that the rook couldn't (e.g., diagonally), thus avoiding a vun. In either case, `Q_cost <= R_cost`.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says \"Help him to find such N x N numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\" and provides an example for `N=4` where `R_cost = 1` and `Q_cost = 2`. This means my initial reasoning `Q_cost <= R_cost` is flawed.\n\nThe flaw is in assuming \"at the same step\". The sequence of moves is determined by the numbers on the board. The rook and queen follow *different paths* because their sets of accessible cells differ.\n\nLet's reconsider the objective: We want the rook to pay a vun, and the queen to pay *more* vuns. This implies we need to construct the board such that the queen is forced to teleport more often than the rook.\nA piece teleports when its current position is \"isolated\" from all unvisited cells. That is, all cells reachable in one move are already visited.\n\nConsider `N=1`. The board is `[1]`. Both pieces start at 1. All cells visited. No vuns paid. `R_cost = 0`, `Q_cost = 0`. Not strictly less. So `N=1` is `-1`.\n\nFor `N > 1`:\nWe need to make the queen get \"stuck\" more often than the rook. This means we want to visit cells reachable by the queen (especially diagonally) *earlier* than the rook would, but *not* earlier than the queen would.\n\nLet's try a simple pattern. We can fill cells with small numbers such that they \"block\" the queen's path more effectively than the rook's.\nConsider filling cells in a checkerboard pattern.\nCells `(r, c)` where `r+c` is even could be one group, and `r+c` is odd could be another.\nA queen can move between cells of different `r+c` parity (horizontal/vertical moves) and between cells of the same `r+c` parity (diagonal moves).\nA rook always moves between cells of different `r+c` parity.\n\nLet's try to make the queen pay vuns by isolating it.\nA strategy:\n1. Fill all cells `(r, c)` where `r+c` is even with numbers `1, 2, ..., ceil(N*N/2)`.\n2. Fill all cells `(r, c)` where `r+c` is odd with numbers `ceil(N*N/2)+1, ..., N*N`.\n\nThis way, the first `ceil(N*N/2)` moves will mostly be within cells of the same `r+c` parity.\nLet's assign numbers:\n*   Cells `(r, c)` where `(r+c)` is even: Fill with `1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   Cells `(r, c)` where `(r+c)` is odd: Fill with `ceil(N*N/2)+1, ceil(N*N/2)+2, ...`\n\nLet `count_even = ceil(N*N/2)` and `count_odd = floor(N*N/2)`.\nThe numbers `1` to `count_even` go into even-parity cells.\nThe numbers `count_even+1` to `N*N` go into odd-parity cells.\n\nLet's trace the rook and queen with this pattern.\nSuppose cell `(r, c)` with number `1` has `r+c` even.\n*   **Rook:** Starts at `1`. It can only move to cells `(r', c)` or `(r, c')`. All these cells have `r'+c` or `r+c'` having different parity from `r+c`. So, the rook can only move to cells with large numbers (`> count_even`). The minimum accessible number will be `count_even+1`.\n    Since `N > 1`, there's always at least one such cell. So the rook will never pay a vun initially. It will visit all `count_even` cells, then `count_even+1`, etc.\n    The rook will first visit all `count_even` cells. Then it will start visiting `count_odd` cells.\n    When the rook is at an even-parity cell, it will look for the smallest unvisited number in its row/column. This will be an odd-parity cell.\n    When the rook is at an odd-parity cell, it will look for the smallest unvisited number in its row/column. This will be an even-parity cell (if any are left) or another odd-parity cell (if all even-parity cells are visited).\n    The rook will eventually visit all cells. It might pay vuns if all cells in its current row/column are visited before all cells are visited.\n\n*   **Queen:** Starts at `1`. If `(r, c)` has `r+c` even.\n    The queen can move to:\n    *   Cells `(r', c)` or `(r, c')` (odd parity, large numbers).\n    *   Cells `(r+k, c+k)`, `(r+k, c-k)` (even parity, small numbers).\n    The queen will prioritize moves to other even-parity cells (which have smaller numbers `2, 3, ...`).\n    So the queen will visit all `count_even` cells first, without paying any vuns, by moving diagonally.\n\nNow, after all `count_even` cells are visited (i.e., numbers `1` to `count_even` are visited by both pieces), both pieces are at the last visited even-parity cell (`count_even`).\nThe remaining unvisited cells are all `count_odd` cells, which have numbers `count_even+1` to `N*N`.\nFrom this point, both pieces will be at an even-parity cell.\n*   **Rook:** Can only move to odd-parity cells. It will pick the smallest unvisited odd-parity cell from its row/column.\n*   **Queen:** Can move to odd-parity cells (horizontal/vertical) or even-parity cells (diagonal). But all even-parity cells are already visited. So the queen can only move to odd-parity cells. It will pick the smallest unvisited odd-parity cell from its row/column/diagonal.\n\nAt this stage, both pieces behave similarly, moving to the smallest unvisited number among reachable odd-parity cells.\nIt seems this pattern does not guarantee `R_cost < Q_cost`. Both might pay 0 vuns, or pay similar amounts.\n\nThe example output for `N=4` is:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet's analyze the `N=4` example:\n`N*N = 16`.\n`count_even = ceil(16/2) = 8`.\n`count_odd = floor(16/2) = 8`.\nNumbers `1..8` are \"small\", `9..16` are \"large\".\n\nParity of `r+c`:\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) -> E O E O\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) -> O E O E\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) -> E O E O\n(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) -> O E O E\n\nExample board with `r+c` parity:\n`E O E O`\n`O E O E`\n`E O E O`\n`O E O E`\n\nNumbers `1..8` (small) are: `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8`\nNumbers `9..16` (large) are: `9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16`\n\nLet's check the example board's parity distribution:\nCell (r,c) | Value | r+c parity\n-----------|-------|-----------\n(0,0)      | 4     | E\n(0,1)      | 3     | O\n(0,2)      | 6     | E\n(0,3)      | 12    | O\n(1,0)      | 7     | O\n(1,1)      | 5     | E\n(1,2)      | 9     | O\n(1,3)      | 15    | E\n(2,0)      | 14    | E\n(2,1)      | 1     | O\n(2,2)      | 11    | E\n(2,3)      | 10    | O\n(3,0)      | 13    | O\n(3,1)      | 8     | E\n(3,2)      | 16    | O\n(3,3)      | 2     | E\n\nSmall numbers (1-8):\n1 at (2,1) O\n2 at (3,3) E\n3 at (0,1) O\n4 at (0,0) E\n5 at (1,1) E\n6 at (0,2) E\n7 at (1,0) O\n8 at (3,1) E\n\nCount of small numbers in E-parity cells: 5 (2,4,5,6,8)\nCount of small numbers in O-parity cells: 3 (1,3,7)\n\nCount of large numbers (9-16):\n9 at (1,2) O\n10 at (2,3) O\n11 at (2,2) E\n12 at (0,3) O\n13 at (3,0) O\n14 at (2,0) E\n15 at (1,3) E\n16 at (3,2) O\n\nCount of large numbers in E-parity cells: 3 (11,14,15)\nCount of large numbers in O-parity cells: 5 (9,10,12,13,16)\n\nThis distribution is not a simple checkerboard pattern. It seems to mix small and large numbers in both parities.\nThe key must be to make the queen get stuck. The queen can move diagonally. If we fill all cells diagonally reachable from the current cell with small numbers and then visit them, the queen might exhaust its diagonal options quickly.\n\nLet's try to put numbers `1` to `N*N` in a specific order.\nThe board has `N*N` cells.\nWe can divide the cells into two groups:\nGroup A: `ceil(N*N/2)` cells.\nGroup B: `floor(N*N/2)` cells.\n\nLet's try to fill the board by alternating small numbers and large numbers.\nFor example, fill the first `ceil(N*N/2)` cells with `1, 2, ..., ceil(N*N/2)`.\nFill the remaining `floor(N*N/2)` cells with `N*N, N*N-1, ..., ceil(N*N/2)+1`.\nThis is often done by filling the first half of cells (e.g., `(r,c)` where `r` is small) with small numbers, and the second half with large numbers.\n\nA common pattern to ensure one piece gets stuck more often is to make it visit a \"dense\" region of numbers, then a \"sparse\" region.\nConsider filling the board in a snake-like pattern.\nOr, we can divide the board into two halves.\nFor example, top half and bottom half.\nFill cells `(r, c)` where `r < N/2` with small numbers `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nFill cells `(r, c)` where `r >= N/2` with large numbers `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\n\nLet's try a specific construction:\nFill `ceil(N*N/2)` cells with numbers `1, 2, ..., ceil(N*N/2)`.\nFill the remaining `floor(N*N/2)` cells with numbers `ceil(N*N/2)+1, ..., N*N`.\n\nWhich cells to pick for the first group?\nIf we pick cells `(r, c)` such that `(r+c)` is even for the first group, and `(r+c)` is odd for the second group:\nLet `k = ceil(N*N/2)`.\nAssign `1, ..., k` to even `r+c` cells.\nAssign `k+1, ..., N*N` to odd `r+c` cells.\n\nRook:\nStarts at `1` (even `r+c`). Can only move to odd `r+c` cells. All these have numbers `> k`. So it will take the smallest `> k` in its row/column. This means the rook will visit `1`, then jump to `k+1`, then `2`, then `k+2`, etc. It will alternate between small and large numbers. This means it's less likely to get stuck because it always has small numbers of the other parity to jump to.\n\nQueen:\nStarts at `1` (even `r+c`). Can move to odd `r+c` cells (large numbers) or even `r+c` cells (small numbers).\nIt will prioritize `2, 3, ...` (even `r+c` cells) by moving diagonally.\nSo the queen will visit all `k` cells (`1` to `k`) first, by moving diagonally. It will not pay any vuns during this phase, as long as there is an unvisited even `r+c` cell reachable diagonally.\nAfter visiting all `k` cells, the queen is at cell `k`. All even `r+c` cells are visited.\nNow, the queen is at an even `r+c` cell, and all reachable even `r+c` cells are visited. It can only move to odd `r+c` cells. All these have numbers `> k`.\nSo the queen will take the smallest `> k` in its row/column/diagonal.\nFrom this point, both rook and queen are looking for the smallest unvisited number from the remaining `N*N - k` numbers.\nThe rook will have visited `1, k+1, 2, k+2, ...`\nThe queen will have visited `1, 2, ..., k, k+1, k+2, ...`\n\nThis strategy makes the queen visit all `k` cells first, then all `N*N-k` cells. The rook alternates.\nThis means the queen's path is `1 -> 2 -> ... -> k -> k+1 -> ... -> N*N`.\nThe rook's path is `1 -> (k+1 or some other large number) -> 2 -> (k+2 or some other large number) -> ...`\nThis strategy makes the queen's path \"smoother\" in terms of numbers, which usually means fewer vuns. We want the opposite.\n\nLet's try to put small numbers in one half of the board, and large numbers in the other half.\nFor example, fill the first `ceil(N*N/2)` cells from `1` to `ceil(N*N/2)`.\nFill the remaining `floor(N*N/2)` cells from `ceil(N*N/2)+1` to `N*N`.\n\nConsider filling the `N/2` rows (or `(N+1)/2` rows if N is odd) with numbers `1` to `ceil(N*N/2)`.\nAnd the remaining `N - N/2` rows with `ceil(N*N/2)+1` to `N*N`.\n\nLet `num_small = ceil(N*N/2)`.\nLet `num_large = floor(N*N/2)`.\n\nStrategy:\nFill the first `num_small` cells with `1, ..., num_small`.\nFill the remaining `num_large` cells with `num_small+1, ..., N*N`.\n\nWhich cells are `num_small` cells?\nLet's fill them in a snake pattern.\nRow 0: `1, 2, ..., N`\nRow 1: `2N, 2N-1, ..., N+1`\nRow 2: `2N+1, 2N+2, ..., 3N`\n...\nThis is a common way to fill a matrix.\n\nLet's try to fill the top-left `N/2 x N` rectangle and `N x N/2` rectangle.\nA simple approach to creating a difference:\nPut `1` in the middle of the board.\nOr put `1` in a corner.\n\nThe example `N=4` output:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\nCell `1` is at `(2,1)`.\nLet's manually trace the example `N=4` solution from the problem.\n`N=4`, `N*N=16`.\n\nBoard:\n`[[4, 3, 6, 12],`\n` [7, 5, 9, 15],`\n` [14, 1, 11, 10],`\n` [13, 8, 16, 2]]`\n\nInitial state: Current cell `(2,1)` (value 1), visited: `{1}`.\n\n**Rook's Path:**\nCurrent `(2,1)` (value 1).\nReachable unvisited:\n`(0,1)` (3), `(1,1)` (5), `(3,1)` (8)\n`(2,0)` (14), `(2,2)` (11), `(2,3)` (10)\nMin is `3` at `(0,1)`.\nPath: `1 -> 3` (at `(0,1)`).

Total 3 vuns.\nLet's check the example's trace again:\nQueen goes through `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`.\nMy path for queen: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 8 -> 7 -> 11 -> 9 -> 10 -> 12 -> 13`\nExample path for queen: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12`\nThe paths differ after `6`.\nMy path after `6` (at `(0,2)`): min reachable is `8` at `(3,1)`.\nExample path after `6` (at `(0,2)`): min reachable is `9` at `(1,2)`.\nLet's re-evaluate queen at `(0,2)` (value 6). Visited: `{1,3,4,2,5,6}`.\nReachable unvisited:\nRook's moves:\n`(0,3)` (12)\n`(1,2)` (9), `(2,2)` (11), `(3,2)` (16)\nDiagonal moves:\n`(1,1)` (5, visited)\n`(1,3)` (15)\n`(2,0)` (14)\n`(3,1)` (8)\nSmallest is `8` at `(3,1)`. My trace is correct.\nThe example trace is wrong, or I misunderstood something.\n\"Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number.\"\nMy list of reachable cells:\n`{(0,3):12, (1,2):9, (2,2):11, (3,2):16, (1,3):15, (2,0):14, (3,1):8}`.\nThe minimum is indeed `8`. So my trace is correct, and the example trace provided in the problem statement is incorrect for the queen.\n\nIf my trace is correct, the queen pays 3 vuns, and the rook pays 1 vun. `1 < 3` is true. So the example board works.\n\nThe construction of the example board seems to put small numbers in a somewhat scattered way.\n`1` at `(2,1)`\n`2` at `(3,3)`\n`3` at `(0,1)`\n`4` at `(0,0)`\n`5` at `(1,1)`\n`6` at `(0,2)`\n`7` at `(1,0)`\n`8` at `(3,1)`\n\nNotice a pattern:\n`1, 3, 5, 7` are at `(2,1), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0)` (odd numbers, mostly near `1`).\n`2, 4, 6, 8` are at `(3,3), (0,0), (0,2), (3,1)` (even numbers).\n\nIt seems the small numbers are placed such that they often force the queen to move to a cell that is not directly adjacent to the previous one, thus \"consuming\" its diagonal moves.\n\nLet's try to construct a general solution based on the checkerboard idea, but with a twist.\nWe want the rook to avoid vuns, and the queen to get stuck.\nThe rook gets stuck if its entire row and column are visited.\nThe queen gets stuck if its entire row, column, and diagonals are visited.\nSince the queen has more ways to move, it's harder to get her stuck than the rook.\nTo make the queen pay *more*, we need to make her current position \"isolated\" more often than the rook.\n\nConsider placing numbers `1, ..., N*N` in an alternating pattern.\nFill `N*N` cells in two groups:\nGroup 1: `(r,c)` where `r+c` is even.\nGroup 2: `(r,c)` where `r+c` is odd.\nThere are `ceil(N*N/2)` cells in one group and `floor(N*N/2)` in the other.\nLet's say `count1 = ceil(N*N/2)` and `count2 = floor(N*N/2)`.\n\nFill `count1` cells (`r+c` even) with numbers `1, ..., count1`.\nFill `count2` cells (`r+c` odd) with numbers `count1+1, ..., N*N`.\n\nThis is the strategy I analyzed before.\nRook: Starts at `1` (even). Must move to an odd cell (large number `> count1`). Then to `2` (even).\nPath: `1 -> (large) -> 2 -> (large) -> ...`\nQueen: Starts at `1` (even). Can move to `2` (even) diagonally.\nPath: `1 -> 2 -> ... -> count1 -> (large) -> (large) -> ...`\n\nThis strategy makes the queen visit all small numbers first, then all large numbers. The rook alternates.\nThis means the queen's path is `1, 2, ..., count1, count1+1, ..., N*N`.\nThe rook's path is `1, (some_large_number), 2, (some_other_large_number), ...`\nThe queen's path is \"smoother\" in terms of numbers. This would lead to 0 vuns for the queen, or fewer vuns. This is the opposite of what we want.\n\nWe need to make the queen's path \"jumpier\" than the rook's.\nThis means we need to put small numbers in places that are *not* diagonally connected, but *are* horizontally/vertically connected.\n\nConsider this construction:\nWe want the queen to get stuck. This happens if all her neighbors (rook + diagonal) are visited.\nIf we put numbers `1, ..., N*N/2` in a way that exhausts the queen's options quickly.\nAnd `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` in the remaining cells.\n\nLet's try to fill the board with two sets of numbers.\nSet A: `1, 2, ..., N*N/2`\nSet B: `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`\nWe want the queen to visit cells from Set A, then get stuck, and then visit cells from Set B.\nAnd the rook to visit cells from Set A and Set B in a way that it doesn't get stuck often.\n\nA simple construction that works for `N=4` (and `N>=4` in general):\nFill the `N x N` board.\nPlace numbers `1, 2, ..., N*N/2` in the cells `(r,c)` such that `r+c` is even.\nPlace numbers `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` in the cells `(r,c)` such that `r+c` is odd.\nThis is the checkerboard pattern.\nLet `small_count = N*N // 2`.\nLet `large_start = small_count + 1`.\n\nIterate `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`.\nIf `(r+c)` is even: assign `board[r][c] = small_num_counter++`.\nIf `(r+c)` is odd: assign `board[r][c] = large_num_counter++`.\n\nExample `N=4`:\n`small_count = 8`.\n`large_start = 9`.\n`small_num_counter` goes `1..8`.\n`large_num_counter` goes `9..16`.\n\nBoard `N=4` with this pattern:\n`E O E O`\n`O E O E`\n`E O E O`\n`O E O E`\n\nNumbers:\n`[[1, 9, 2, 10],`\n` [11, 3, 12, 4],`\n` [5, 13, 6, 14],`\n` [15, 7, 16, 8]]`\n\nLet's re-trace this board for `N=4`.\nStart at `1` at `(0,0)`. Visited: `{1}`.\n\n**Rook's Path:**\nCurrent `(0,0)` (value 1).\nReachable unvisited:\n`(0,1)` (9), `(1,0)` (11)\nMin is `9` at `(0,1)`.\nPath: `1 -> 9` (at `(0,1)`).

This rook path will alternate between small and large numbers. It will fill out the board by moving from an even parity cell to an odd parity cell, then to another even parity cell, etc.\nIt will likely not pay any vuns, or very few, because it always has options to move to an unvisited cell of the other parity.\n\n**Queen's Path:**\nCurrent `(0,0)` (value 1).\nReachable unvisited:\nRook's: `(0,1)` (9), `(1,0)` (11)\nDiagonal: `(1,1)` (3), `(2,2)` (6), `(3,3)` (8)\nMin is `3` at `(1,1)`.\nPath: `1 -> 3` (at `(1,1)`).

The remaining unvisited cells are all odd `r+c` cells, with numbers `9..16`.\nFrom `(3,3)` (even `r+c`), the queen can only move to odd `r+c` cells.\nReachable unvisited:\nRook's: `(0,3)` (10), `(1,3)` (visited), `(2,3)` (14), `(3,0)` (15), `(3,1)` (visited), `(3,2)` (16)\nDiagonal: `(0,0)` (visited), `(1,1)` (visited), `(2,2)` (visited)\nMin is `10` at `(0,3)`.\nPath: `... -> 8 -> 10` (at `(0,3)`). Visited: `{...8, 10}`.\n\nThis strategy makes the queen visit all `small_count` cells first, then all `large_count` cells.\nThe queen will not pay any vuns during the first phase (visiting `1..small_count`) as long as there is always an unvisited cell of the same parity reachable. In a `N x N` grid, as long as `N > 1`, `1` will always have a diagonal neighbor of the same parity (e.g., `(1,1)` from `(0,0)`). The queen can always reach another even `r+c` cell if one exists, until all even `r+c` cells are visited.\nAfter all `small_count` cells are visited, the queen is at `small_count`. All even `r+c` cells are visited.\nNow, the queen must move to an odd `r+c` cell (which means a large number `> small_count`).\nIt will take the smallest `large_start`.\nAt this point, the queen is at an odd `r+c` cell. All even `r+c` cells are visited.\nThe queen can only move to even `r+c` cells (all visited) or other odd `r+c` cells.\nIt will try to move to the smallest unvisited odd `r+c` cell.\nIt will continue this until all `large_count` cells are visited.\nIt is possible that it gets stuck during this second phase, because it is trying to connect to cells of the same parity (odd `r+c`) via horizontal/vertical moves, but its diagonal moves (to even `r+c` cells) are exhausted.\nThis means the queen could pay vuns in the second phase.\n\nLet's consider the rook's path again for `N=4` with this board:\n`[[1, 9, 2, 10],`\n` [11, 3, 12, 4],`\n` [5, 13, 6, 14],`\n` [15, 7, 16, 8]]`\nRook starts at `(0,0)` (1).\n1.

This works!\n\nThis checkerboard filling strategy seems to work for `N=4`.\nLet's check for general `N`.\n**Rook Cost:**\nThe rook will always alternate between even `r+c` cells and odd `r+c` cells.\nWhen at an even `r+c` cell (small number), it looks for the smallest unvisited in its row/column. This will be an odd `r+c` cell (large number).\nWhen at an odd `r+c` cell (large number), it looks for the smallest unvisited in its row/column. This could be an even `r+c` cell (small number, if any are left) or another odd `r+c` cell (large number).\nSince there are `N` cells in each row/column, and these cells alternate `r+c` parity, a rook will always have at least one unvisited cell of the opposite parity in its row/column unless that row/column is completely visited.\nThe rook will visit all cells by alternating between small and large numbers. It's highly unlikely to get stuck, as it always has options to move to a cell of the other parity. It will pay 0 vuns.\n\n**Queen Cost:**\nThe queen starts at `1` (even `r+c`). It will prioritize other even `r+c` cells (small numbers) by moving diagonally. It will visit all `small_count` cells (`1` to `small_count`) without paying vuns.\nAfter visiting `small_count` cells, the queen is at `small_count`. All even `r+c` cells are visited.\nNow the queen must move to an odd `r+c` cell (large number). It picks `large_start`.\nFrom this point, the queen is always at an odd `r+c` cell. All even `r+c` cells are visited.\nThe queen can move to:\n1.  Even `r+c` cells (horizontally/vertically). These are all visited.\n2.  Odd `r+c` cells (diagonally). These are the remaining unvisited cells.\nSo, the queen must find the smallest unvisited odd `r+c` cell reachable diagonally.\nIf no such cell exists, it gets stuck and pays a vun.\nIn an `N x N` grid, the number of cells of same parity reachable diagonally can be limited.\nFor example, if `N` is even, `N/2` cells of same parity can be on a diagonal.\nIf `N` is odd, `(N+1)/2` cells of same parity can be on a diagonal.\nWhen the queen is at an odd `r+c` cell, it can only reach other odd `r+c` cells diagonally.\nThis means the queen effectively gets limited to a \"sub-grid\" of odd-parity cells for its diagonal moves.\nIt's likely that the queen will exhaust its diagonal options within the odd-parity cells and then get stuck.\nThe rook, on the other hand, can always switch parities with horizontal/vertical moves.\n\nThis strategy should work for `N >= 2`.\nFor `N=1`, it's `-1`.\nFor `N=2`:\n`small_count = 2`, `large_start = 3`.\nBoard:\n`[[1, 3],`\n` [4, 2]]`\nRook:\n1.

So `N=2` is also `-1`.\n\nMy earlier analysis of the example `N=4` output showed `R_cost = 1` and `Q_cost = 3`.\nMy proposed checkerboard solution for `N=4` gives `R_cost = 0` and `Q_cost = 1`.\nBoth satisfy `R_cost < Q_cost`.\n\nThe problem example states `N=4` has a solution. My checkerboard solution provides one.\nThe example output for `N=4` is:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\nThis is not the checkerboard pattern. But it works.\n\nThe checkerboard pattern:\nIf `N` is even, `N*N/2` cells are even `r+c` and `N*N/2` cells are odd `r+c`.\nIf `N` is odd, `(N*N+1)/2` cells are even `r+c` and `(N*N-1)/2` cells are odd `r+c`.\nMy code will assign `1` to `N*N/2` cells and `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` cells.\nThis means `small_count = ceil(N*N/2)`.\n`large_start = small_count + 1`.\n\nThe rook will always be able to find a cell of the other parity. It will visit all cells without paying vuns.\nThe queen will visit all `small_count` cells first. Then all `large_count` cells.\nDuring the second phase (visiting `large_count` cells), the queen is always at an odd `r+c` cell. All even `r+c` cells are visited.\nThe queen needs to find unvisited odd `r+c` cells.\nIt can move horizontally/vertically to an even `r+c` cell (all visited).\nIt can move diagonally to an odd `r+c` cell.\nThis is where it gets stuck.\nA queen at `(r,c)` (odd `r+c`) can reach `(r+k, c+k)`, `(r+k, c-k)` (odd `r+c`).\nIf `N` is odd, the center cell `(N/2, N/2)` is an even `r+c` cell.\nIf `N` is even, there is no single center cell.\n\nLet's check the condition for `N=2`.\n`small_count = 2`, `large_start = 3`.\nBoard: `[[1,3],[4,2]]`\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4`. `R_cost = 0`.\nQueen: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`. `Q_cost = 0`.\nSo `N=2` is `-1`.\n\nMy logic for `N=2` (checkerboard) giving 0 vuns for both is solid.\nThis means my checkerboard strategy only works for `N >= 3`.\nFor `N=3`:\n`N*N = 9`. `small_count = 5`, `large_start = 6`.\nBoard:\n`E O E`\n`O E O`\n`E O E`\nNumbers: `1..5` in E-cells, `6..9` in O-cells.\n`[[1, 6, 2],`\n` [7, 3, 8],`\n` [4, 9, 5]]`\nRook:\nStarts `(0,0)` (1).\n1. `(0,0)` (1).

For `N=1,2,3` print `-1`.\nFor `N >= 4`, we need a solution.\nThe example board is not a simple pattern like snake or checkerboard.\nMaybe the solution for `N=4` can be used to construct solutions for `N > 4` by tiling or extending?\nFor `N=5`, we could try to place `1` in the middle `(2,2)`.\n\nLet's re-examine the example trace, assuming it's correct and my re-trace is wrong.\nQueen at `(0,2)` (value 6). Visited: `{1,3,4,2,5,6}`.\nExample says next is `9` at `(1,2)`.\nMy list of reachable: `{(0,3):12, (1,2):9, (2,2):11, (3,2):16, (1,3):15, (2,0):14, (3,1):8}`.\nMin is `8`. Why `9`?\nIs the example implicitly using 0-indexed vs 1-indexed? No.\nIs it possible that the definition of \"reachable in one move\" for queen is different from standard?\n\"The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance.\" This is standard.\nThere must be a mistake in my understanding of the problem or my trace.\n\nLet me re-check the example trace for the queen.\n`1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`.\nQueen at `(0,2)` (value 6). Visited: `{1,3,4,2,5,6}`.\nReachable unvisited:\n`{(0,3):12, (1,2):9, (2,2):11, (3,2):16, (1,3):15, (2,0):14, (3,1):8}`.\nThe minimum among these is `8`. The example says `9`.\nThis is a direct contradiction.\nCould it be that \"minimal number\" is chosen from a *subset* of reachable cells? No, \"Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move\".\n\nThis means I should assume the example trace is wrong, and my checkerboard solution for `N=4` (R=0, Q=0) is correct.\nIf my trace of the example board is correct (`R_cost=1, Q_cost=3`), then that board is a valid solution for `N=4`.\nBut if the example trace is correct (`R_cost=1, Q_cost=2`), then it means my reachable cells list or min logic is wrong.\nLet's trust my own logical deduction of reachable cells and minimum.\nMy trace of the example board:\nRook: 1 vun.\nQueen: 3 vuns.\nThis means the example board *does* work for `N=4` with my understanding of the rules.\n\nSo we need a solution for `N >= 4`.\nThe example board is a valid solution for `N=4`.\nHow to generalize it?\nThe example board looks like it has been manually constructed.\nIt divides numbers `1..16` into two groups: `1..8` and `9..16`.\nIt tries to place `1..8` in a way that makes queen jump around.\nAnd `9..16` in a way that makes queen get stuck.\n\nLet's try to construct a solution for `N >= 4`.\nFill the top-left `(N/2) x (N/2)` cells with small numbers.\nFill the bottom-right `(N/2) x (N/2)` cells with large numbers.\nAnd the remaining cells with intermediate numbers.\nThis might be too complex.\n\nA simpler strategy:\nFill the first `N*N/2` cells with `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nFill the remaining `N*N/2` cells with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nLet's try to fill the board by iterating `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`.\nIf `(r,c)` is in the first `N*N/2` cells in row-major order: assign `small_num++`.\nElse: assign `large_num++`.\nThis puts all small numbers in the top half (or so) of the board.\n`N=4`: `N*N/2 = 8`.\n`[[1,2,3,4],`\n` [5,6,7,8],`\n` [9,10,11,12],`\n` [13,14,15,16]]`\nAs analyzed, this gives `R_cost=0, Q_cost=0`. Not good.\n\nWhat if we fill the board in a \"spiral\" pattern? Or a \"wave\" pattern?\nThe example solution implies that `N=1,2,3` are impossible.\nSo the code should print `-1` for `N=1,2,3`.\nFor `N >= 4`, we need a construction.\nThe example `N=4` is:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet `small_count = N*N // 2`.\nLet `large_count = N*N - small_count`.\nAssign `1, ..., small_count` to `small_nums`.\nAssign `small_count+1, ..., N*N` to `large_nums`.\n\nWe need to place these numbers on the board.\nLet's try to place `small_nums` in `(r,c)` where `r < N/2` and `c < N/2`. This is a block.\nNo, that was `0` vuns for both.\n\nThe key must be to make the queen's path jump around and exhaust options, especially diagonal ones.\nLet's try to put small numbers in `N/2` rows, but alternate which rows.\nFor example, put `small_nums` in rows `0, 2, 4, ...` and `large_nums` in rows `1, 3, 5, ...`.\n`N=4`:\nRows `0,2` get `1..8`. Rows `1,3` get `9..16`.\n`[[1,2,3,4],`\n` [9,10,11,12],`\n` [5,6,7,8],`\n` [13,14,15,16]]`\nStart at `1` at `(0,0)`.\nRook: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`. Then from `(0,3)` (4) to `(2,3)` (8). `4 -> 8`.\nPath: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5`.

This means simple block-based or row-based patterns generally lead to 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe example `N=4` solution is the key.\nIt seems to be a specific arrangement for `N=4`.\nIf `N` is even, say `N=2k`.\nThe example board for `N=4` has a specific structure.\nLet's try to generalize the `N=4` solution.\nThe `N=4` solution has `1` at `(2,1)`.\n`2` at `(3,3)`.\n`3` at `(0,1)`.\n`4` at `(0,0)`.\n`5` at `(1,1)`.\n`6` at `(0,2)`.\n`7` at `(1,0)`.\n`8` at `(3,1)`.\nThe numbers `1..8` are placed somewhat in a \"cross\" or \"X\" pattern.\n\nThe solution in the example for `N=4` is:\n`4  3  6 12`\n`7  5  9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16  2`\n\nLet's construct a pattern for `N >= 4`.\nFill `N*N` cells.\n`small_count = N*N // 2`.\n`large_count = N*N - small_count`.\n\nFill `board[r][c]` with `small_num` if `(r+c)` is even and `r < N/2` or `r >= N/2` and `c >= N/2`.\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nLet's try to simplify the board construction.\nWhat if we place `1, ..., small_count` in the top `N/2` rows and `small_count+1, ..., N*N` in the bottom `N/2` rows, but fill them in reverse order for some rows?\nThis is the pattern that yields 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe only way to guarantee `R_cost < Q_cost` is if `Q_cost >= 1` and `R_cost = 0`.\nThis implies the rook never gets stuck, but the queen gets stuck at least once.\nThe rook never gets stuck if it always finds an unvisited cell in its row/column. This is likely true for any reasonable board for `N >= 4`.\nThe queen gets stuck if all its neighbors (rook + diagonal) are visited.\n\nThe example solution for `N=4` is likely the key for `N >= 4`.\nA common technique for `N >= 4` if `N=1,2,3` are special is to use `N=4` as a base and extend it.\nFor example, for `N=5`, we can put the `N=4` solution in the top-left `4x4` block, and fill the remaining row/column.\nBut the numbers `1..16` would be shifted.\n\nLet's try to put numbers into two halves of the board.\n`small_num = 1`\n`large_num = N*N`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r+c)` is even: `board[r][c] = large_num--`\n    Else (`(r+c)` is odd): `board[r][c] = small_num++`\n\nExample `N=4`:\n`small_num` goes `1..8`.\n`large_num` goes `16..9`.\nBoard:\n`[[16, 1, 15, 2],`\n` [3, 14, 4, 13],`\n` [12, 5, 11, 6],`\n` [7, 10, 8, 9]]`\n\nRook: Starts at `1` at `(0,1)`.\n1. `(0,1)` (1).

If there are several solutions, you can output any of them.\"\nThis implies one general solution.\n\nLet's assume the problem setter expects a pattern that works for `N >= 4`.\nThe only way the queen pays more vuns than the rook is if the queen gets stuck while the rook doesn't.\nThis happens if the queen exhausts its diagonal options, while the rook still has horizontal/vertical options.\nThis means we need to \"disconnect\" the queen's diagonal paths.\n\nConsider the construction:\nFill the board in a snake pattern.\n`N=4`:\n`[[1, 2, 3, 4],`\n` [8, 7, 6, 5],`\n` [9, 10, 11, 12],`\n` [16, 15, 14, 13]]`\nRook: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> ... -> 16`. `R_cost = 0`.\nQueen: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> ... -> 16`. `Q_cost = 0`.\nThis also gives 0 vuns.\n\nIt seems all simple patterns result in 0 vuns for both.\nThe problem setter must have a specific non-obvious construction in mind.\nSince the example solution is provided for `N=4`, and my re-trace of it indicates `R=1, Q=3`, it's a valid solution for `N=4`.\nI will use this for `N=4`.\nFor `N=1,2,3`, print `-1`.\nFor `N > 4`, I will try a simple pattern:\nFill `board[r][c]` with `r * N + c + 1` (row-major order).\nThis is the `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...` board.\nThis yields 0 vuns for both.\nIf this problem is for \"Road to 1600\", it usually means there is a clever construction.\nMy assumption that the example trace is wrong and my trace is right for the given example board is crucial.\n\nWhat if the strategy is to put `1` in a corner, then alternate small and large numbers?\n`N=4`:\n`board[0][0] = 1`.\n`small_num = 2`. `large_num = N*N`.\nFill `(r,c)`:\nIf `(r+c)` is even and `(r,c)` is not `(0,0)`: fill with `large_num--`.\nIf `(r+c)` is odd: fill with `small_num++`.\nThis is placing `1` at `(0,0)`, then `2,3,...` at odd `r+c` cells, and `N*N, N*N-1, ...` at other even `r+c` cells.\n`[[1, 2, 16, 3],`\n` [4, 15, 5, 14],`\n` [13, 6, 12, 7],`\n` [8, 11, 9, 10]]`\nRook from `(0,0)` (1): `(0,1)` (2), `(1,0)` (4).

Path: `1 -> 2`.\nThis also yields 0 vuns for both.\n\nIt's possible that the problem setter assumes `N >= 4` and the example applies to all `N >= 4` by scaling or some transformation.\nThe numbers in the example are `1..16`.\nIf `N=5`, we need `1..25`.\nThe structure of the example board is not obvious to generalize.\n\nGiven the constraints and problem type, the solution for `N >= 4` might be simpler than trying to reverse-engineer the example.\nIf `N` is even, say `N=2k`.\nIf `N` is odd, say `N=2k+1`.\n\nLet's assume `N=1,2,3` are `-1`.\nFor `N >= 4`, let's try a simple pattern:\nFill `1, ..., N*N/2` in the top half of the board (rows `0` to `N/2-1`).\nFill `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` in the bottom half of the board (rows `N/2` to `N-1`).\nThis was my `R=0, Q=0` pattern.\n\nThe only way to achieve `R < Q` is if the queen is forced to teleport.\nThis means the queen must be \"trapped\" by already visited cells.\nThis implies placing small numbers in a way that allows the queen to visit them all, thus blocking its diagonal escape routes, while the rook can still move freely.\n\nConsider placing numbers `1, ..., N/2` in a line (e.g., `(0,0), (0,1), ..., (0, N/2-1)`).\nThen `N/2+1, ..., N` in another line.\nThis is getting too specific.\n\nGiven the time limit, the solution must be efficient. `O(N^2)` to print the board.\nThe logic for `N=1,2,3` is `-1`.\nFor `N>=4`, there should be a general construction.\n\nLet's use the pattern from the example for `N=4`.\nFor `N > 4`, let's try to fill the board by alternating numbers.\n`small_val = 1`\n`large_val = N*N`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `c % 2 == 0`: `board[r][c] = large_val--`\n    Else: `board[r][c] = small_val++`\nThis fills even columns with large numbers, odd columns with small numbers.\n`N=4`:\n`[[16, 1, 15, 2],`\n` [14, 3, 13, 4],`\n` [12, 5, 11, 6],`\n` [10, 7, 9, 8]]`\nRook from `(0,1)` (1): `(0,0)` (16), `(0,2)` (15), `(0,3)` (2), `(1,1)` (3), `(2,1)` (5), `(3,1)` (7).

I'll stick with the `N=1,2,3` are `-1` and for `N=4` use the example.\nFor `N > 4`, I will use a construction that places `1` and `2` far apart, and makes the queen visit all small numbers.\nThe construction that makes queen pay vuns is when it is forced to move to large numbers, while the rook still has small numbers.\nThis means the queen exhausts its small-number options.\n\nLet's try to fill the first half of the cells (by row-major order) with numbers `N*N/2 + 1` to `N*N`.\nAnd the second half of the cells with `1` to `N*N/2`.\nThis means `1` will be at `(N/2, 0)` (if `N` is even).\n`N=4`:\n`[[9, 10, 11, 12],`\n` [13, 14, 15, 16],`\n` [1, 2, 3, 4],`\n` [5, 6, 7, 8]]`\nRook from `(2,0)` (1): `(0,0)` (9), `(1,0)` (13), `(3,0)` (5), `(2,1)` (2), `(2,2)` (3), `(2,3)` (4).
