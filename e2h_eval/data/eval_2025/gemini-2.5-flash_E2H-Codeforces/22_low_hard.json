After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Let's Get This Marks Problem Solved in Python**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Marks.\" I need to write a Python script to figure out how many students are \"successful.\"  The problem description is pretty clear, but let's break it down to make sure I've got all the pieces.\n\nFirst, the input:  We have `n` students and `m` subjects, and then `n` lines of marks, each with `m` digits.  Makes sense.  I'll need to store those marks.  A list of lists, or a 2D array, seems like the most logical choice. Each inner list will represent a student's marks.  And since these marks are initially characters, I'll probably need to convert them to integers for comparison. So, a `gradebook` list of lists of integers it is! `gradebook[student_idx][subject_idx]` will give me the mark for student `student_idx` in subject `subject_idx`.\n\nNow, the definitions.  A \"best\" student in a subject means they got the maximum mark for that subject.  A \"successful\" student just means they're best at *at least one* subject.  Simple enough.\n\nHere's the algorithm I'm going to follow:\n\n**Step 1: Read the Input**.  Read `n` and `m`, then read in all the marks and populate my `gradebook` list of lists.  I'll probably use a nested loop for this.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Maximum Marks Per Subject.**  I'll need to find the highest mark for each subject.  I can iterate through each subject (column in my `gradebook`) and then iterate through all the students (rows) within that subject, keeping track of the maximum mark I encounter. I'll store these maximums in a list called `max_marks_per_subject`.  The size of this list will be `m`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Successful Students.**  I'll need to track who's successful.  A boolean array, `is_successful`, with a length of `n` (one entry for each student) will work perfectly.  Initially, all entries in `is_successful` will be `False`. Then, I'll go through each student and each subject, checking if their mark for a subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If it does, that student is successful! I'll set `is_successful[student_idx]` to `True`, and since the problem says that *at least* one subject is enough, I can immediately break out of the inner loop (over subjects) for that student.\n\n**Step 4: Count Successful Students.**  Finally, I just need to count how many `True` values are in the `is_successful` array and print the result.  That'll be the answer!\n\nLet's look at the example they provided.  If I follow this breakdown, it all should make sense. Great, let's turn this into code!\n",
