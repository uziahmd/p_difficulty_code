The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this competitive programming problem and my thought process for tackling it.**\n\nWe're given a tree representing districts, each with a contestant and a number of fans that grows exponentially with the district index.  The goal is to remove a certain number of contestants, leaving a connected group of contestants with the maximum total fans.  Since the fan count is `2^i`, maximizing the total fans is the same as minimizing the *sum* of indices of the removed contestants.  This suggests a greedy approach, and the exponential growth of `2^i` is the key insight.\n\nThe core idea is that we should almost always want to keep the district with the highest index, as its value is overwhelmingly large.  This leads to the realization that we're essentially looking for a connected subgraph of `n-k` nodes that maximizes the sum of node indices. This must include the largest node, `N`.  We should try to *remove* nodes with small indices. If we want to *keep* largest possible indices, we essentially grow outward from `N`.\n\nThis seems like a tree traversal problem, specifically starting from the node with the highest index. I should create an adjacency list. The constraint on the connection as a tree is useful.  Given the exponentially large values of `2^i`, and the need to preserve connectivity, it implies a greedy method will be optimal.\n\nTo formalize this, I can imagine the process as a modified breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) rooted at the largest node, `N`.  I want to add the largest-indexed neighbors to a set, while preserving connectivity. This is a bit like Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees, but in reverse. I'll maintain a set of \"kept\" nodes and a priority queue to select the largest index node among the ones reachable from current kept nodes.\n\nThe implementation details are a standard adjacency list, and since I need `k` numbers and should prioritize largest node indices, I will need a priority queue. Because the built-in python priority queue is a min-heap, I'll store negative node indices so that the smallest negative value is the largest positive value.\n\nI can initialize my data structures: `kept_nodes`, which is a set for O(1) membership checks; an adjacency list `adj` to store edges of the given graph, and a priority queue `pq`. To begin, I add node `N` to both `kept_nodes` and `pq`. Next, I continue to take items from the priority queue that represent the neighbor of current connected components to the priority queue. During each step, I will need a counter to iterate at most `k-1` times. The goal is to keep the `n-k` remaining nodes and to print out the `k` removed nodes.\nThe time complexity should be O(N log N) dominated by the priority queue operations. The algorithm seems correct for the problem given the logic and analysis, with the edge cases working correctly.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts that form a connected component in a given tree structure, such that the total number of fans of the contestants from these districts is maximized. The number of fans for a contestant from district `i` is `2^i`. We then need to output the `k` districts that were *removed*, in increasing order.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nThe fan count `2^i` grows exponentially with `i`. This means that including a district with a higher index `i` contributes significantly more to the total sum than including multiple districts with much smaller indices. For example, `2^N` is greater than the sum of all `2^j` for `j < N`. This strong dominance suggests a greedy strategy: we should prioritize keeping districts with the largest possible indices.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Start with the largest district:** The district with index `n` has the highest fan count (`2^n`). It is almost always optimal to include district `n` in our connected component, as replacing it with any other set of districts would likely result in a much smaller total fan count.\n2.  **Greedy Expansion:** After including district `n`, we need to select `n-k-1` more districts to form a connected component. To maximize the sum, we should always choose the available district with the largest index that is adjacent to any district already in our component. This ensures connectivity and maximizes the sum of `2^i` values.\n\nThis approach is similar to Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree, but instead of minimizing edge weights, we are maximizing node values (indices) by prioritizing which nodes to add to our growing connected component.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Build Adjacency List:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list. Since district numbers are 1-indexed, an array of lists of size `n+1` is convenient.\n2.  **Initialize:**\n    *   `kept_nodes`: A set to store the indices of districts we decide to keep.\n    *   `pq`: A max-priority queue (implemented using Python's `heapq` as a min-heap by storing negative values) to hold candidate districts for expansion. These candidates are neighbors of districts already in `kept_nodes`.\n    *   `num_kept`: A counter for the number of districts currently in `kept_nodes`.\n3.  **Start Expansion:**\n    *   Add the largest district `n` to `kept_nodes`.\n    *   Push `-n` (for max-heap behavior) onto `pq`.\n    *   Set `num_kept = 1`.\n4.  **Iterative Expansion:**\n    *   While `num_kept < n-k` (we still need to select more districts) and `pq` is not empty:\n        *   Pop the district `current_node` with the largest index from `pq` (by popping the smallest negative value).\n        *   For each `neighbor` of `current_node`:\n            *   If `neighbor` is not already in `kept_nodes`:\n                *   Add `neighbor` to `kept_nodes`.\n                *   Push `-neighbor` onto `pq`.\n                *   Increment `num_kept`.\n                *   If `num_kept` reaches `n-k`, we have selected enough districts. Break out of both the inner and outer loops.\n5.  **Identify Removed Districts:**\n    *   Create a set of all district numbers from `1` to `n`.\n    *   The `k` removed districts are those in the set of all districts but *not* in `kept_nodes`.\n    *   Convert this set to a list and sort it in increasing order.\n6.  **Print Output:** Print the sorted list of removed districts, space-separated.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n=6, k=3`. We need to keep `n-k = 3` districts.\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\nGraph:\n1 -- 2 -- 3\n     | \\\n     4  6 -- 5\n\n1.  **Adj List:**\n    1: [2]\n    2: [1, 3, 4, 6]\n    3: [2]\n    4: [2]\n    5: [6]\n    6: [2, 5]\n2.  **Initialize:** `kept_nodes = set()`, `pq = []`, `num_kept = 0`.\n3.  **Start:**\n    *   `kept_nodes.add(6)`. `kept_nodes = {6}`.\n    *   `heapq.heappush(pq, -6)`. `pq = [-6]`.\n    *   `num_kept = 1`.\n4.  **Iterative Expansion:**\n    *   **Loop 1:** `num_kept` (1) < `n-k` (3). `pq` is not empty.\n        *   `current_node = -heapq.heappop(pq)` which is `6`. `pq = []`.\n        *   Neighbors of 6: `[2, 5]`.\n            *   `neighbor = 2`. Not in `kept_nodes`.\n                *   `kept_nodes.add(2)`. `kept_nodes = {6, 2}`.\n                *   `heapq.heappush(pq, -2)`. `pq = [-2]`.\n                *   `num_kept = 2`.\n            *   `neighbor = 5`. Not in `kept_nodes`.\n                *   `kept_nodes.add(5)`. `kept_nodes = {6, 2, 5}`.\n                *   `heapq.heappush(pq, -5)`. `pq = [-5, -2]` (heap order).\n                *   `num_kept = 3`.\n                *   `num_kept` (3) == `n-k` (3). Break inner loop.\n    *   Outer loop condition `num_kept < n-k` (3 < 3) is now false. Loop terminates.\n5.  **Identify Removed Districts:**\n    *   `all_nodes = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.\n    *   `kept_nodes = {6, 2, 5}`.\n    *   `removed_nodes = all_nodes - kept_nodes = {1, 3, 4}`.\n    *   Sorted: `[1, 3, 4]`.\n6.  **Print:** `1 3 4`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** Building the adjacency list takes O(N) time. The main loop processes each of the `N` nodes at most once (when it's added to `kept_nodes` and its neighbors are explored) and each of the `N-1` edges at most twice. Each `heapq` operation takes O(log N) time. Thus, the total time complexity is O(N log N). Given `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is approximately `10^6 * 20 = 2 * 10^7`, which is efficient enough for typical time limits.\n*   **Space Complexity:** The adjacency list, `kept_nodes` set, and priority queue all store up to `N` elements, resulting in O(N) space complexity.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and k from the first line of input\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Build adjacency list for the tree.\n    # We use n+1 size to easily handle 1-based indexing for districts.\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # Set to store the indices of districts that will be kept in the final connected component.\n    kept_nodes = set()\n    \n    # Priority queue (max-heap) to store candidate nodes for expansion.\n    # Python's `heapq` is a min-heap.
