He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the \"Check the String\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Check the String\" problem, and I need to whip up a Python script to solve it. Let me break down the core logic here. The problem revolves around a string's construction and its adherence to specific rules.\n\nFirst, we start with a string of lowercase 'a's â€“ that's the base. The string must have at least one 'a'. Next, some number of 'b's are added to the end. Crucially, there must be at least one 'a' and at least one 'b' after this step. This gives us the pattern of all 'a's preceding all 'b's. Finally, some number of 'c's are appended. This is where the core condition kicks in: the count of 'c's must either equal the count of 'a's, or the count of 'b's, or possibly both. The critical observation is that 'c's are appended, meaning that if there are any 'c's, the count must be >= 1.\n\nSo, in essence, I'm dealing with a string that has to follow a precise structure: some 'a's, followed by some 'b's, followed by some 'c's. It's essentially a partition, and all characters must be in this order. Additionally, all characters must be in the correct order: all 'a's, then all 'b's, and finally, all 'c's. No deviation is permitted.\n\nIn conclusion, a valid string must satisfy these conditions:\n\n1.  The string must consist of zero or more 'a's, followed by zero or more 'b's, followed by zero or more 'c's.\n2.  At least one 'a' and one 'b' must be present, and it's most likely that at least one 'c' must also be present (since C *appends* 'c's).\n3.  The count of 'c's should be equal to the count of 'a's or equal to the count of 'b's.\n",
