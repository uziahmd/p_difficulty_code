He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing String Formation Rules for a Python Script**\n\nOkay, I'm thinking about this string validation problem. The user needs a Python script, and I need to figure out the logic behind it. It seems we have a string `S` that needs to be checked against a specific set of rules.\n\nBasically, the string is built in three steps: 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. There are a few key constraints that I need to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, there has to be at least one 'a' at the beginning (`count_a >= 1`). Then, there has to be at least one 'b' following the 'a's (`count_b >= 1`). Finally, there have to be at least one 'c' following the 'b's (`count_c >= 1`). Here's the kicker: the number of 'c's has to be *either* equal to the number of 'a's *or* the number of 'b's. It could also be equal to both!\n\nNow, to implement this, I'll need to analyze the input string `S`. I need to find the points where the 'a's end and the 'b's begin, and where the 'b's end and the 'c's begin. Let's call these indices `i` and `j`, respectively.\n\nThe string can be visualized as three parts: the 'a's part, `S[0 ... i-1]`, the 'b's part, `S[i ... j-1]`, and the 'c's part, `S[j ... |S|-1]`.\n\nSo, the first step is to figure out `count_a`. I think I'll just iterate through the string from the beginning and count the consecutive 'a's. The index of the last 'a' will be `idx_a_end`. Thus, `count_a = idx_a_end + 1`.\n\nA critical check is in order here: if I find a 'b' or 'c' before I find any 'a', or if there are no 'a's at all, then it's immediately invalid. Also, I need to make sure `count_a` is at least 1, otherwise it's not a valid string. I think this will be a good starting point for the script.\n",
