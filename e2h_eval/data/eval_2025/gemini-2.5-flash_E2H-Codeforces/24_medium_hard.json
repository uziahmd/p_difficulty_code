She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for Minimizing Tab Closing Time**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core of this problem is figuring out the quickest way to end up with just the tabs within a specified range `[l, r]` open. We start with all tabs open and the cursor somewhere (position `pos`). We've got four possible actions: move left, move right, close all tabs to the left of the cursor, or close all tabs to the right. Each action takes one unit of time.\n\nInitially, I looked at this as needing to close two sets of tabs: those to the left of `l` and those to the right of `r`. The trick is finding the most efficient sequence. We know we'll have to close each section at least once (that's the time cost).\n\nThe simplest case is when all tabs are within the valid range, `l=1` and `r=n`. No action needed, so zero time.\n\nIf `l = 1` and `r < n`, we only need to close tabs to the right of `r`. We figure out how far the cursor needs to move to get to `r` (`abs(pos - r)`) and add one for closing the tabs.\n\nIf `l > 1` and `r = n`, it's the opposite: close tabs to the left. Again, move the cursor and close.\n\nThe more complex scenario is when both `l > 1` and `r < n`.  We definitely need to close two groups of tabs (minimum time of two). Here's where it gets interesting: the order of closing matters. Do we move to `l` and close left, then move to `r` and close right? Or do we do it the other way around?\n\nI realized we need the minimum time of these two approaches. If we move from `pos` to `l` (cost `abs(pos-l)`) then to `r`, and close those sections, total time is  `abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2`. Likewise if the strategy is to move from `pos` to `r`, and then `l`,  `abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2` The `(r - l)` term will be common, so  I need to minimize the movement cost from the starting position to either l or r and the final answer will be that plus (r - l) + 2.\n\nWe can simplify the above two equations to: minimum(`abs(pos - l)` or `abs(pos-r)`) + (r-l) + 2.\nWe need to check that both are working. If the position is close to l, then we move towards l, then r. Conversely.\n\nI've checked the logic with a few test cases, including when the starting position is within or outside the desired range to be sure everything makes sense. The time complexity is O(1).\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all browser tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`. We are given `n` total tabs, the current cursor position `pos`, and the desired range `[l, r]`.\n\nThere are two types of operations, each taking 1 second:\n1.  **Move cursor:** Move one step left or right. If the cursor is at tab `i`, it can move to `max(i-1, a)` or `min(i+1, b)`, where `a` and `b` are the minimum and maximum indices of currently unclosed tabs.\n2.  **Close tabs:** Close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. If the cursor is at tab `i`, it can close `[a, i-1]` or `[i+1, b]`.\n\nInitially, `a=1` and `b=n`. Our goal is to reach a state where `a=l` and `b=r`. This implies closing tabs `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.\n\nWe can analyze the problem based on which parts of the tabs need to be closed:\n\n**Case 1: `l = 1` and `r = n`**\nIn this case, all tabs from 1 to `n` are needed. No tabs need to be closed.\nThe minimum time is `0`.\n\n**Case 2: `l = 1` (but `r < n`)**\nWe only need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. The tabs `[1, r]` must remain.\nTo do this, Luba must:\n1.  Move the cursor from its current `pos` to tab `r`. The cost for this is `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n2.  Close all tabs to the right of `r`. This operation takes `1` second. After this, `b` becomes `r`.\nTotal time = `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**Case 3: `r = n` (but `l > 1`)**\nWe only need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. The tabs `[l, n]` must remain.\nTo do this, Luba must:\n1.  Move the cursor from its current `pos` to tab `l`. The cost for this is `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n2.  Close all tabs to the left of `l`. This operation takes `1` second. After this, `a` becomes `l`.\nTotal time = `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n**Case 4: `l > 1` and `r < n`**\nWe need to close tabs on both sides: `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This will require two \"close\" operations, costing 2 seconds in total.\nThere are two main strategies:\n\n*   **Strategy A: Close left side first, then right side.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second. After this, `a` becomes `l`. The cursor is at `l`.\n    3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Since `l <= r`, this means moving right `r - l` times. Cost: `r - l` seconds. The cursor is at `r`.\n    4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second. After this, `b` becomes `r`.\n    Total time for Strategy A = `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\n*   **Strategy B: Close right side first, then left side.**\n    1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1` second. After this, `b` becomes `r`. The cursor is at `r`.\n    3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Since `l <= r`, this means moving left `r - l` times. Cost: `r - l` seconds. The cursor is at `l`.\n    4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1` second. After this, `a` becomes `l`.\n    Total time for Strategy B = `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nThe minimum time for Case 4 is `min(Strategy A time, Strategy B time)`.\nThis simplifies to `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nThe movement costs `abs(pos - target)` and `(r - l)` are always valid because the cursor can move freely within the current `[a, b]` range. Initially, `[a, b]` is `[1, n]`. After closing one side, the range shrinks, but `l` and `r` will always be within the new `[a, b]` range, allowing direct movement between them.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem statement): `n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4`**\nThis is Case 4 (`l > 1` and `r < n`).\nUsing the formula: `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`\n`min(abs(3 - 2), abs(3 - 4)) + (4 - 2) + 2`\n`min(1, 1) + 2 + 2`\n`1 + 2 + 2 = 5`.\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    # Case 1: No tabs to close (l=1 and r=n)\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        ans = 0\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the right of r need to be closed (l=1, r<n)\n    elif l == 1:\n        # Move cursor from pos to r (abs(pos - r) seconds)\n        # Close tabs to the right of r (1 second)\n        ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the left of l need to be closed (l>1, r=n)\n    elif r == n:\n        # Move cursor from pos to l (abs(pos - l) seconds)\n        # Close tabs to the left of l (1 second)\n        ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    # Case 4: Tabs on both sides need to be closed (l>1, r<n)\n    else:\n        # We need to perform two close operations (cost 2 seconds).\n        # We need to move the cursor to 'l' and to 'r'.\n        # The path can be: pos -> l -> r (cost abs(pos - l) + (r - l))\n        # Or: pos -> r -> l (cost abs(pos - r) + (r - l))\n        # We choose the path that minimizes initial movement to 'l' or 'r'.\n        ans = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n    \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
