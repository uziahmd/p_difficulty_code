He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem.**\n\nFirst off, I need to really understand the core of the problem. We've got this unknown string `s` of length `n`. We're given `2n-2` strings, which are essentially all the possible prefixes and suffixes of `s` (excluding `s` itself). The twist? We don't know *which* string is a prefix and which is a suffix.  My goal is to figure out for each of those input strings whether it's a prefix or a suffix. The kicker? My output has to be consistent with *at least one* valid `s`.\n\n**So, the strategy unfolds like this:**\n\n1.  **Spotting the Pattern:**  The key insight here is that for each length from 1 up to `n-1`, we'll have *exactly* two strings. One is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\n2.  **The Master Key: String Reconstruction:**  If I can nail down the prefix of length `n-1` ( `s[0...n-2]` ) and the suffix of length `n-1` (`s[1...n-1]`), I can reconstruct the whole original string `s`.  The key thing is this:  These two strings *must* overlap by `n-2` characters. In other words,  `s[0...n-2][1:]` has to be equal to `s[1...n-1][:-1]`.  Luckily, the problem setup ensures this overlap will always be true!\n\n3.  **Finding `s`:** There will be two strings of length `n-1` in the input. Let's call them `str1` and `str2`.  There are two possible scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario A:** `str1` is the prefix (`s[0...n-2]`) and `str2` is the suffix (`s[1...n-1]`). We check if  `str1[1:] == str2[:-1]`. If so, we reconstruct `s` as `str1 + str2[-1]`.\n    *   **Scenario B:**  `str2` is the prefix and `str1` is the suffix. We do the same check: `str2[1:] == str1[:-1]`. If true, reconstruct `s` as `str2 + str1[-1]`.\n\n4.  **A Valid Answer is Enough:** The beauty here is that even if both scenarios produce a valid `s`, the problem only asks for *any* valid answer.  I don't need to try and find every possible `s`.\n\n5.  **Assigning the P's and S's:** Once I've picked a candidate `s` (or the one and only `s`), the final step is to figure out whether each input string is a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') *relative to my chosen `s`*.\n\n**My detailed plan to code this up would be like so:**\n\n1.  **Read the Input:** Read `n` and all the `2n-2` strings.  I'd store each string along with its original index for later reference.\n\n2.  **Find the Candidates:** Filter the input strings to get those of length `n-1`. I will call them `cand1` and `cand2`.\n\n3.  **Reconstruct and Verify:** I'll try both possible combinations (prefix/suffix) for `cand1` and `cand2` to reconstruct the `s` candidates. If a reconstruction is valid (overlap check is true), I save that `s` candidate.\n\n4.  **Pick an `s`:** As the problem guarantees a valid `s`, I'll take the first valid reconstruction I found.\n\n5.  **Generate Prefixes/Suffixes:**  For this chosen `s`, I generate all its actual prefixes (`s[0...k-1]`) and suffixes (`s[n-k...n-1]`). I'd likely store them in sets for fast lookup.\n\n6.  **Assigning Carefully:** This is where it gets interesting! Now, I iterate through the original input strings (with their indices).  I compare each input string to the *generated prefixes/suffixes* of my chosen `s`.\n\n    *   **The Key to Correct Assignment**:  The crux is making sure I'm matching strings of the *same* length. I can use counters to keep track of the number of each prefix/suffix so that in case there are identical prefixes/suffixes (e.g., if `s` is \"aba\"), I can make the assignments without issues.\n\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine, for a given set of `2n-2` strings, which are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that these `2n-2` strings are precisely all improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths 1 to `n-1`) of some valid string `s`. Each length `k` from 1 to `n-1` will have exactly two strings in the input: one is `s[0...k-1]` (a prefix) and the other is `s[n-k...n-1]` (a suffix).\n\nThe core idea is to first reconstruct the original string `s`. Once `s` is known, we can easily determine its prefixes and suffixes and then match them to the input strings.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1.  **Read Input and Group by Length:**\n    Read `n` and all `2n-2` input strings. It's crucial to keep track of their original input order (indices) because the output must correspond to this order. A good way to organize the strings is to group them by their length. A `defaultdict(list)` can be used for this, mapping length `k` to a list of `(string, original_index)` tuples.\n\n2.  **Identify Candidates for `s[0...n-2]` and `s[1...n-1]`:**\n    The strings of length `n-1` are special. There will be exactly two such strings in the input. One of them must be the prefix `s[0...n-2]` and the other must be the suffix `s[1...n-1]`. Let these two strings be `str1` and `str2`.\n\n3.  **Reconstruct `s`:**\n    There are two hypotheses for `str1` and `str2`:\n    *   **Hypothesis A:** `str1` is `s[0...n-2]` and `str2` is `s[1...n-1]`.\n        In this case, `s` can be formed by `str1 + str2[-1]`. For this to be valid, the overlapping part must match: `str1[1:]` (which is `s[1...n-2]`) must be equal to `str2[:-1]` (also `s[1...n-2]`). If this condition holds, `str1 + str2[-1]` is a candidate for `s`.\n    *   **Hypothesis B:** `str2` is `s[0...n-2]` and `str1` is `s[1...n-1]`.\n        Similarly, `s` can be formed by `str2 + str1[-1]`. The validity check is `str2[1:] == str1[:-1]`. If this holds, `str2 + str1[-1]` is another candidate for `s`.\n\n    Since the problem guarantees a consistent set of prefixes/suffixes, at least one of these hypotheses will lead to a valid string `s`. If both lead to valid (possibly identical) strings, we can pick any one. Let's choose the first valid `s` found.\n\n4.  **Generate True Prefixes and Suffixes of `s`:**\n    Once we have our chosen `s`, we generate all its prefixes `s[0...k-1]` and suffixes `s[n-k...n-1]` for `k` from 1 to `n-1`. To handle cases where `s[0...k-1]` might be identical to `s[n-k...n-1]` (e.g., \"aba\" for \"ababa\"), and to ensure we assign `n-1` 'P's and `n-1` 'S's, we can use `defaultdict(int)` to count the required occurrences of each prefix and suffix string.\n    *   `true_prefix_counts[p]` will store 1 for each unique prefix `p`.\n    *   `true_suffix_counts[sf]` will store 1 for each unique suffix `sf`.\n\n5.  **Assign 'P' or 'S' to Input Strings:**\n    Initialize an array `result_chars` of size `2n-2` to store the 'P' or 'S' for each input string.\n    Iterate through the `input_strings_with_indices` (in their original order):\n    For each `(current_str, original_idx)`:\n    *   Check if `current_str` is a prefix of `s` and if `true_prefix_counts[current_str]` is greater than 0. If both are true, it means we still need to assign a 'P' for this string. Assign `result_chars[original_idx] = 'P'`, and decrement `true_prefix_counts[current_str]`.\n    *   Otherwise, it must be a suffix. Assign `result_chars[original_idx] = 'S'`, and decrement `true_suffix_counts[current_str]`. (The decrement for suffixes is mostly for consistency; the prefix check is primary for distinguishing when a string could be both).\n\n    This logic ensures that for each length `k`, one input string is marked 'P' and the other 'S', even if they are identical (e.g., `s=\"aaa\"`, length 1 prefix \"a\" and length 1 suffix \"a\"). The first \"a\" encountered will be marked 'P', and the second \"a\" will be marked 'S'.\n\n6.  **Print Result:**\n    Join the characters in `result_chars` to form the final output string.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Example 1: `n=5`, `s=\"ababa\"`):**\nInput: `ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba`\nOriginal indices: `(ba,0), (a,1), (abab,2), (a,3), (aba,4), (baba,5), (ab,6), (aba,7)`\n\n1.  **Group by length:**\n    `len 1: [(\"a\",1), (\"a\",3)]`\n    `len 2: [(\"ba\",0), (\"ab\",6)]`\n    `len 3: [(\"aba\",4), (\"aba\",7)]`\n    `len 4: [(\"abab\",2), (\"baba\",5)]`\n\n2.  **Length `n-1 = 4` strings:**\n    `cand1_str = \"abab\"` (idx 2), `cand2_str = \"baba\"` (idx 5)\n\n3.  **Reconstruct `s`:**\n    *   Hypothesis A: `s[0...3] = \"abab\"`, `s[1...4] = \"baba\"`.\n        Check: `cand1_str[1:]` (\"bab\") == `cand2_str[:-1]` (\"bab\").
