Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. My goal is to write a Python script to find the minimum radius a light source needs to cover a given street.**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. I've got a street of length `l`, lanterns at different positions `a_i`, and each lantern can light a segment of the street. I want the smallest radius `d` so the whole street is lit.\n\nThe constraints are pretty manageable: `n` is at most 1000, `l` is up to 10^9, and lantern positions are within the street.\n\nMy strategy involves a few key steps:\n\n1.  **Sorting:** Sorting the lantern positions is crucial. It helps me efficiently identify gaps and critical points.\n\n2.  **Edge Coverage:** I need to ensure the beginning (point 0) and the end (point `l`) of the street are lit.  The first lantern has to reach 0, so `d` must be at least as big as the first lantern's position, `a_0`. Similarly, the last lantern needs to reach `l`, so `d` must be at least `l - a_{n-1}`.\n\n3.  **Gap Analysis:**  The tricky part is dealing with the spaces *between* the lanterns. I have to find the largest gap, calculate the minimum radius needed to cover that gap, and ensure my final radius works for the entire street.\n\n4.  **Radius Calculation:** I'll calculate `d` values for each of these cases (`a_0`, `l - a_{n-1}`, and gaps), and take the maximum among them. That's my minimum radius.\n\nI have to consider edge cases: what if there's only one lantern? All the lanterns are at the same point? Or a lantern at 0 and another at `l`? My logic should handle them correctly.\n\nFinally, I'm using Python's `float` for `d` because I'm dealing with potentially fractional distances. The output needs to be precise.  I'm using the `\"{:.10f}\".format()` for that precise format.\n\nI've tested the strategy with the given examples and other scenarios. I am confident in this solution.\n",
