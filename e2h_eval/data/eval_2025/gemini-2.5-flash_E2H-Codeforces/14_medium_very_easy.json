He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**I'm tackling a competitive programming problem involving factorials and trailing zeroes.** The task is to find all positive integers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. First, I have to understand how to compute the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`. This is equivalent to finding the number of factors of 5 in `n!` since there are always more factors of 2. I'm going to use Legendre's formula, which involves calculating `floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + ...` until the denominator exceeds `n`.  \n\nI need to analyze this function. It's non-decreasing, and it only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5. I realize that this function can skip some values; for instance, the number of trailing zeroes can jump from 4 to 6.  My approach will be to use binary search. I need to find the smallest `n` for which the number of trailing zeroes is equal to `m`.\n\nTo use binary search effectively, I need to define the search space. A reasonable upper bound for `n` seems to be around `5 * m`. I test this a little with `m=1` and `m=100000`, and this looks good. I'll define my `count_trailing_zeroes` function, and implement the binary search algorithm, initializing my search space. I also have to handle the case where the value `m` is skipped.  If the binary search doesn't find a corresponding `n`, I output \"0\". If it does, then I know that there are exactly 5 integers that will have m trailing zeroes. The solution involves outputting 5, then 5 integer values.\n\nI've tested the logic with several examples to make sure it functions correctly, including cases where the solution requires checking for skipped values. I also have to make sure my logic is efficient. I know that computing the trailing zeroes can be done efficiently with a loop that keeps dividing by 5. I consider edge cases like what the maximum value can be for n based on the maximum m and double checked the problem statement's output formatting. The complete approach is now implemented in code.\n",
