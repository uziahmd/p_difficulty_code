And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Reasoning for Calculating Average Sleep Time Over Weeks**\n\nAlright, here's my thought process. The problem asks for the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks,\" where a week is a consecutive series of days. I've got a total of 'n' days of sleep records, and each week is 'k' days long. The goal is to figure out the average sleep time across *every single possible* week.\n\nMy approach: first, I've got to define what \"every single possible week\" means. If I have 'n' days and a week is 'k' days long, then the number of weeks is 'n - k + 1'. I need to consider all these sliding windows of 'k' consecutive days within the 'n' day record.\n\nNow, for *each* week, I calculate the total sleep time for those 'k' days. I do this by summing up the sleep times for each day in that week. Then I add up all of these weekly sums to get a grand total. Finally, to find the average, I divide this grand total by the total number of weeks. Simple math, but there is an optimization needed to meet the performance constraints.\n\nEfficiency is important here. A naive approach of iterating through each week and summing the individual sleep times would be too slow.  I need a more efficient way to calculate the sums of these weeks.\n\nThat's where the sliding window approach comes in. I calculate the sum of the first week initially. Then, for each subsequent week, I avoid recalculating the entire sum. Instead, I just subtract the sleep time of the day that \"leaves\" the window and add the sleep time of the day that \"enters\" the window. This reduces the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n), as it only involves addition/subtraction, per window slide.\n\nSo, the algorithm becomes:\n1.  Calculate the sum of the first 'k' days, i.e., the first week.\n2.  Use a sliding window to efficiently calculate the sums for all remaining weeks.\n3. Sum these sums, then divide by the total number of weeks (n-k+1).\n\nWith this approach, I can handle the constraints on 'n' and 'k' efficiently. I'm taking advantage of the consecutive nature of the \"weeks\" to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nI've carefully considered the edge cases where k=1 or k=n, and have checked that this sliding window logic works. The maximum possible value of intermediate calculations (and the output, the sum of all week sums, which will be divided to produce the final answer) also had to be considered to check for possible overflow. Python's integer type, however, will be fine. I'm using Python's float division to make sure the output has the right format.\n",
