There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Solution to the Zoning Restrictions Again Problem**\n\nI'm tackling the \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem, and my approach centers around efficiently managing height restrictions for houses across `n` spots.  The core idea is to determine the *effective* maximum height allowed for each house, considering both global height limits (`h`) and local restrictions (`m`).\n\nFirst, I initialize an array, `house_max_heights`, representing the maximum allowable height for each spot. Initially, all houses can reach the maximum height `h`. Then, I process the restrictions. Each restriction `(l, r, x)` means the houses from spot `l` to `r` cannot exceed height `x`. For each spot within that range, I update its `house_max_heights` value to be the minimum of its current value and `x`. This effectively enforces the most restrictive height limit for each spot.\n\nThe crucial optimization lies in understanding that because profit is the square of height (`a^2`), which is monotonically increasing, the optimal solution is to always build each house to its maximum allowed height. Once I've calculated the final `house_max_heights` array (where each element represents the *actual* height), calculating the total profit is straightforward: sum the squares of each height.\n\nThe time complexity is `O(m * n)` because I iterate through the restrictions and potentially update the `house_max_heights` array for each spot within a restriction. Given the small constraints (`n, m <= 50`), this is perfectly acceptable. The space complexity is `O(n)` to store `house_max_heights`, which is also negligible.\n\nThe code works by first reading in `n`, `h`, and `m`, then creating the `house_max_heights` array. It then iterates through the `m` restrictions, adjusting the maximum allowed height for each spot as needed. Finally, it calculates the total profit and prints it.\n",
