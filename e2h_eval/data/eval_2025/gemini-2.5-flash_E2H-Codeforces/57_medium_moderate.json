His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order.

Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Best and Worst Olympiad Ranks for Vasya**\n\nI'm tackling a problem where I need to determine the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given the scores from two rounds, the minimum score Vasya needs (`x`), and the number of participants (`n`). The catch is, the order of scores doesn't matter, and any score from round one can be paired with any score from round two, as long as the total is at least `x`.\n\nMy first thought is to understand the \"arbitrary order\" and pairing flexibility. I realize I have `n` scores from each round, and my goal is to create `n` pairs that will define the total score for all the participants. Crucially, Vasya's score needs to be at least `x`. I need to figure out how to arrange the pairings to make his rank as good or as bad as possible.\n\nFor the **best rank**, I initially figured the ideal scenario would be for Vasya to grab the highest scores from both rounds, but I quickly realized that's not always valid because the sum needs to be at least `x` and the pairing has to work for all participants. The key is to maximize Vasya's score *relative* to the other participants' scores. I realized that Vasya's best possible score is basically the maximum sum possible. Since the jury is able to decide the ties, Vasya's best rank is always 1, if he's tied with other people, the jury will give him rank 1.\n\nFor the **worst rank**, it's trickier. My approach involves minimizing Vasya's score while maximizing the scores of other participants. That way I maximize the number of competitors that scored higher than Vasya, as well as the competitors who have the same score as him. I'm sorting the scores and looking for combinations of a score in `a` with a score in `b` to optimize the pairings. Binary search seems like a potential strategy here.\n\nI'm thinking this problem probably involves finding a threshold score and then matching all the remaining values from `a` and `b`. The complexity of the problem feels like O(n^2), but my intuition is that there might be more optimized pairing strategies to consider. I'll need to work on a solution that efficiently calculates Vasya's worst possible score by carefully crafting pairings where as many scores as possible are higher than Vasya's.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad, given `n` scores for the first tour (`a`) and `n` scores for the second tour (`b`), and that Vasya's total score is at least `x`. The key aspects are:\n1.  The `a` and `b` lists are unordered; we need to form `n` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` using each score exactly once.\n2.  If participants have the same total score, the jury can assign places arbitrarily. This implies:\n    *   **Best Rank**: If Vasya ties with others, the jury can place him highest among them. His rank is `(number of people with score > Vasya's score) + 1`.\n    *   **Worst Rank**: If Vasya ties with others, the jury can place him lowest among them. His rank is `(number of people with score > Vasya's score) + (number of people with score = Vasya's score)`.\n3.  It's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n\n---\n\n### Best Possible Rank\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank (rank 1), Vasya needs to maximize his own score and ensure no one else scores higher.\nLet `max_a = max(a)` and `max_b = max(b)`.\nThe highest possible total score any participant can achieve is `max_a + max_b`.\nThe problem guarantees that Vasya's score is at least `x`. This implies that there is at least one pair `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nIf `max_a + max_b < x`, then no participant could possibly achieve a score of `x` or more, which contradicts the guarantee. Therefore, `max_a + max_b` must be greater than or equal to `x`.\n\nSo, for the best-case scenario, we can assume Vasya takes the `a_k` that is `max_a` and the `b_l` that is `max_b`. His total score will be `max_a + max_b`. This score is guaranteed to be `>= x`.\nSince `max_a + max_b` is the highest possible score any participant can get, no other participant can score higher than Vasya. The jury can then assign Vasya the first place among those who scored `max_a + max_b`.\nThus, Vasya's best possible rank is always **1**.\n\n---\n\n### Worst Possible Rank\n\nTo achieve the worst possible rank, Vasya needs to:\n1.  Have a score `S_V` such that `S_V >= x`.\n2.  Maximize the number of people who score strictly *higher* than `S_V`.\n3.  Maximize the number of people who score *equal* to `S_V`.\n\nThis means we want to find a pairing for all `n` participants such that Vasya's score `S_V` is as low as possible (but still `>= x`), and the scores of other participants are as high as possible.\n\nLet's sort both `a` and `b` lists in ascending order: `a_sorted` and `b_sorted`.\nConsider a specific score `S_V` that Vasya might get. To maximize the number of people who score higher or equal to `S_V`, we should pair the remaining `n-1` scores such that they sum up to values greater than or equal to `S_V`.\n\nThis problem can be reframed: for a given Vasya's score `S_V`, how many other participants can score strictly higher than `S_V`?\nThe crucial part is that Vasya's score `S_V` must be formed by *some* `a_i` and *some* `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nWe can use a binary search approach for the worst rank. The rank can range from 1 to `n`.\nLet's define a function `check(k)`: Can Vasya get a rank of `k` or worse?\nThis means we need to find a pairing such that at least `k-1` participants score strictly more than Vasya, or `k-1` participants score more than or equal to Vasya (if Vasya is last among ties).\n\nA common strategy for pairing scores to maximize sums for others is to sort one list ascending and the other descending.\nLet `a_s = sorted(a)` and `b_d = sorted(b, reverse=True)`.\nIf we pair `(a_s[i], b_d[i])` for all `i`, these sums `a_s[i] + b_d[i]` are generally \"spread out\" (some high, some low). This is a good strategy to maximize the number of people who beat Vasya.\n\nLet's consider the number of people who can score *at least* `S_target` points.\nWe have `n` scores from tour 1 (`a_s`) and `n` scores from tour 2 (`b_s`).\nTo count how many pairs `(a_s[i], b_s[j])` can be formed such that `a_s[i] + b_s[j] >= S_target`, we can use a two-pointer approach.\nSort `a` ascending and `b` ascending.\nInitialize `count = 0`, `j = n-1` (pointer for `b_s`).\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a_s`):\n  While `j >= 0` and `a_s[i] + b_s[j] >= S_target`:\n    `j -= 1`\n  The number of `b_s` scores that can be paired with `a_s[i]` to reach `S_target` is `n-1-j`.\n  This is not quite right. We need to form *distinct* pairs.\n\nA more direct approach for counting pairs `(a_i, b_j)` with `a_i + b_j >= S_target` using each `a_i` and `b_j` at most once:\nSort `a` ascending and `b` ascending.\nInitialize `count = 0`, `j = n-1` (pointer for `b_s`).\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a_s`):\n  While `j >= 0` and `a_s[i] + b_s[j] >= S_target`:\n    `j -= 1`\n  If `j < i`: (This means `a_s[i]` is too large, or all remaining `b_s` values are too small relative to `a_s[i]`. We can pair `a_s[i]` with `b_s[i]` (if `i` is valid) and proceed. The condition `j < i` is for the two pointers to not cross, effectively. The two pointers are `i` for `a` and `j` for `b`.)\n  The number of pairs we can form is `n - (j+1)`. We can pair `a_s[i]` with `b_s[j+1]`, `a_s[i+1]` with `b_s[j+2]`, etc. This is the greedy approach for finding maximum number of pairs.\n\nLet's refine the `check(k)` function:\n`check(k)`: Can Vasya be ranked `k` or worse?\nThis means we need to find a pairing such that there are at least `k-1` participants who score *strictly higher* than Vasya, OR `k-1` participants who score *at least as much as* Vasya, and Vasya is one of them.\nThe worst rank implies we want to maximize `(count of scores > Vasya's) + (count of scores = Vasya's)`.\n\nConsider the total points `S` for Vasya. `S` must be `>= x`.\nWe want to find the minimum `S` (where `S >= x`) such that we can arrange the remaining `n-1` scores to maximize the number of people better than or equal to `S`.\nLet's iterate through all possible `a_i` values Vasya could take. For each `a_i`, Vasya needs a `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. To minimize `a_i + b_j`, he should take the smallest `b_j` that satisfies this.\nThis implies `b_j >= x - a_i`. We can find such `b_j` using binary search (or `bisect_left`) on `b_sorted`.\n\nLet `a_s = sorted(a)` and `b_s = sorted(b)`.\nFor each `a_s[i]` (Vasya's first tour score):\n  Find the smallest `b_s[j]` such that `a_s[i] + b_s[j] >= x`. This `j` can be found using `bisect_left(b_s, x - a_s[i])`.\n  If such `b_s[j]` exists (i.e., `j < n`):\n    Vasya's score for this choice is `S_V = a_s[i] + b_s[j]`.\n    Now we need to form `n-1` pairs from `a_s` (excluding `a_s[i]`) and `b_s` (excluding `b_s[j]`) to maximize the number of people with scores `>= S_V`.\n    This is a bit tricky because `a_s[i]` and `b_s[j]` are specific elements. Removing them and then re-sorting or using two pointers is complicated.\n\nA simpler approach for the worst rank:\nWhat if we try to make Vasya's score as low as possible (but still `>= x`) and then make as many other scores as possible higher than that?\nThe number of people who score strictly more than Vasya.\nSort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\nLet's try to find how many pairs `(a_i, b_j)` can sum up to at least `S`.\nWe can iterate `i` from `0` to `n-1` for `a_s[i]`. For each `a_s[i]`, we need `b_s[j]` such that `b_s[j] >= S - a_s[i]`.\nThe number of such `b_s[j]` is `n - bisect_left(b_s, S - a_s[i])`.\nThis is the number of `b` scores that, when paired with `a_s[i]`, would result in a sum of at least `S`.\n\nLet `a_s = sorted(a)` and `b_s = sorted(b)`.\nWe are looking for the maximum possible `k` such that Vasya can be rank `k`.\nThis means we need to find a pairing where `k-1` people score `> S_V` or `k-1` people score `>= S_V` (if Vasya is last in ties).\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum `k` such that we can select `k` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` whose sums are all `>= S_V` for some `S_V >= x`, and Vasya is one of these `k` people, and he is ranked `k`-th among them.\n\nThe crucial observation for worst rank:\nVasya's score `S_V` must be at least `x`.\nTo maximize his rank, we want as many people as possible to score higher than or equal to `S_V`.\nLet's try to match `a_s[i]` with `b_s[j]` to maximize the number of high scores.\nConsider `a_s` and `b_s` sorted ascending.\nWe want to find a pairing `(a_p, b_q)` for Vasya such that `a_p + b_q >= x`.\nAnd for the remaining `n-1` values, we want to maximize the number of pairs `(a_k, b_l)` such that `a_k + b_l >= a_p + b_q`.\nThis is precisely the logic of the two-pointer approach to count pairs.\n\nLet's count how many pairs `(a_s[i], b_s[j])` can be formed such that `a_s[i] + b_s[j] >= x`.\nThis count represents the number of participants who *could* have satisfied Vasya's condition.\nLet's define `count_valid_pairs(target_score)`:\nThis function returns the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` that can be formed from the current `a` and `b` lists such that `a_i + b_j >= target_score`.\nTo implement `count_valid_pairs(target_score)`:\n  Sort `a` ascending and `b` ascending.\n  `count = 0`\n  `j = n-1` (pointer for `b_s`)\n  For `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a_s`):\n    While `j >= 0` and `a_s[i] + b_s[j] >= target_score`:\n      `j -= 1`\n    `count += (n - 1 - j)`\n  This approach counts *all* possible pairings. But we need to use each `a_i` and `b_j` exactly once.\n\nThe correct two-pointer approach for maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` s.t. `a_i + b_j >= S`:\n  Sort `a` ascending, `b` ascending.\n  `count = 0`\n  `left = 0` (pointer for `a_s`)\n  `right = n-1` (pointer for `b_s`)\n  While `left < n` and `right >= 0`:\n    If `a_s[left] + b_s[right] >= S`:\n      `count += 1`\n      `left += 1`\n      `right -= 1`\n    Else (`a_s[left] + b_s[right] < S`):\n      `left += 1` (try a larger `a_s` to meet the target `S`)\n  Return `count`.\n\nNow, for the worst rank:\nWe want to find the smallest Vasya's score `S_V` (where `S_V >= x`) such that `count_valid_pairs(S_V)` is maximized.\nNo, this is not right. We want to maximize the number of people who score *at least* Vasya's score, *including Vasya*.\nThe problem is to find `max_k` such that there exists a pairing `P` and a Vasya's score `S_V` (from `P` and `S_V >= x`) where `k` participants have score `>= S_V`.\n\nLet's try to binary search for the *worst rank* `k`.\n`low = 1`, `high = n`. `ans_worst = n`.\nWhile `low <= high`:\n  `mid = (low + high) // 2`\n  If it's possible for Vasya to get rank `mid` (or worse):\n    `ans_worst = mid`\n    `low = mid + 1`\n  Else:\n    `high = mid - 1`\n\nWhat does `possible_rank_k(k)` mean?\nIt means we can find a score `S_V >= x` for Vasya, and a pairing for all `n` participants, such that `k` participants (including Vasya) have scores `>= S_V`.\nThis is equivalent to finding a score `S_V` (from some `a_i, b_j` with `a_i+b_j >= x`) such that `count_valid_pairs(S_V)` is at least `k`.\n\nLet's consider all possible scores `S` from `0` to `2 * 10^5`.\nFor each `S`, calculate `count_valid_pairs(S)`.\nWe are looking for the minimum `S >= x` such that `count_valid_pairs(S)` is maximized.\nThis is not quite right.\nThe `count_valid_pairs` function counts how many pairs *can* be formed such that their sum is at least `S`.\nIf Vasya's score is `S_V`, and `count_valid_pairs(S_V)` returns `C`, it means we can form `C` pairs with scores `>= S_V`. One of these `C` pairs is Vasya's.\nSo, Vasya's worst rank could be `C`.\nWe want to find the `S_V >= x` that maximizes `C`.\n\nLet `a_s = sorted(a)` and `b_s = sorted(b)`.\nIterate through all possible `a_s[i]` for Vasya's first score.\nFor each `a_s[i]`:\n  We need to find a `b_s[j]` such that `a_s[i] + b_s[j] >= x`.\n  To maximize the number of people with score `>= a_s[i] + b_s[j]`, we should make `a_s[i] + b_s[j]` as small as possible.\n  So, for `a_s[i]`, find the smallest `b_s[j]` such that `b_s[j] >= x - a_s[i]`.\n  This `j` can be found using `bisect_left(b_s, x - a_s[i])`. Let this be `idx_b`.\n  If `idx_b == n`, then no `b_s[j]` can satisfy the condition for this `a_s[i]`. Continue to next `a_s[i]`.\n  Otherwise, Vasya's score is `S_V = a_s[i] + b_s[idx_b]`.\n  Now, we have `n-1` `a` scores (all `a_s` except `a_s[i]`) and `n-1` `b` scores (all `b_s` except `b_s[idx_b]`).\n  We need to count how many pairs `(a_k, b_l)` from these remaining scores can achieve `a_k + b_l >= S_V`.\n  This is still complicated because removing elements from sorted lists and re-running two pointers is inefficient.\n\nThe key insight for this type of problem is often to fix one of Vasya's scores, say `a_s[i]`, and then find the optimal `b_s[j]` for it.\nWhen Vasya takes `a_s[i]` and `b_s[j]`, these two scores are removed.\nThe remaining scores are `a_s_prime = a_s[:i] + a_s[i+1:]` and `b_s_prime = b_s[:j] + b_s[j+1:]`.\nWe then count how many pairs from `a_s_prime` and `b_s_prime` can sum to `>= S_V`.\nThis is still `O(N)` for each `i, j` pair, making it `O(N^2)`.\n\nLet's try a different approach for `count_valid_pairs(S)`:\nSort `a` descending, `b` ascending.\n`a_d = sorted(a, reverse=True)`\n`b_s = sorted(b)`\n`count = 0`\n`j = 0` (pointer for `b_s`)\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a_d`):\n  While `j < n` and `a_d[i] + b_s[j] < S`:\n    `j += 1`\n  If `j < n`:\n    `count += (n - j)` (all `b_s[j]` to `b_s[n-1]` can be paired with `a_d[i]` to get `>= S`)\n    This is not right, because we can only use each `b_s[j]` once.\n\nThe correct two-pointer for `count_valid_pairs(S)` (using each `a_i` and `b_j` at most once):\nSort `a` ascending, `b` ascending.\n`count = 0`\n`ptr_a = 0`\n`ptr_b = n-1`\nWhile `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n  If `a_s[ptr_a] + b_s[ptr_b] >= S`:\n    `count += 1`\n    `ptr_a += 1`\n    `ptr_b -= 1`\n  Else: # `a_s[ptr_a] + b_s[ptr_b] < S`\n    `ptr_a += 1` # `a_s[ptr_a]` is too small to form `S` with `b_s[ptr_b]`, try a larger `a_s`\nReturn `count`.\nThis function `count_valid_pairs(S)` is monotonically non-increasing with `S`.\n\nNow, for the worst rank. We want to find a score `S_V >= x` for Vasya, such that `count_valid_pairs(S_V)` is maximized.\nThis is because if `C = count_valid_pairs(S_V)`, it means we can form `C` pairs whose sums are all `>= S_V`. Vasya is one of these `C` participants. To maximize his rank, he would be ranked `C`-th.\nSo we need to find `max(count_valid_pairs(S))` for `S >= x`.\nSince `count_valid_pairs(S)` is non-increasing, we want to pick the smallest possible `S` that is `>= x`.\nSo, Vasya's score `S_V_worst_case` should be the smallest value `S'` such that `S' >= x` and `S'` can be formed by some `a_i + b_j`.\nThe problem states: \"It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 <= i, j <= n) such, that ai + bj >= x.\"\nThis means we can always find such `a_i, b_j`.\n\nTo find the smallest `S_V` that Vasya could have achieved (which is `>= x`):\nIterate `i` from `0` to `n-1`. For each `a_s[i]`:\n  Find `j = bisect_left(b_s, x - a_s[i])`.\n  If `j < n`, then `a_s[i] + b_s[j]` is a candidate for Vasya's minimum score. Let's call this `S_min_possible_for_vasya`.\n  We want to find `min(a_s[i] + b_s[j])` over all valid `i, j`.\n  This is `min_s = float('inf')`.\n  `ptr_b = n-1`\n  For `ptr_a` from `0` to `n-1`:\n    While `ptr_b >= 0` and `a_s[ptr_a] + b_s[ptr_b] >= x`:\n      `min_s = min(min_s, a_s[ptr_a] + b_s[ptr_b])`\n      `ptr_b -= 1`\n  This `min_s` is the smallest score `S_V` Vasya could possibly have, which is `>= x`.\n  Then the worst rank for Vasya is `count_valid_pairs(min_s)`.\n\nLet's test this strategy with the example:\n`n=5, x=2`\n`a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`a_s = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`b_s = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n1.  **Best Rank**: Always 1.
