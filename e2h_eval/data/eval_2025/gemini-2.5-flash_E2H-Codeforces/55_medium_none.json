    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing some specific swaps. The swaps involve '0' and '1', and '1' and '2'. Immediately, I notice that the relative order of '0's and '2's *cannot* be changed.  A '0' can only move past a '1', and a '2' can only move past a '1'.  This means if a '0' comes before a '2' in the original string, it *must* stay that way in the final string. The '1's, on the other hand, are flexible; they can move past any '0' and any '2'.\n\nMy goal is to minimize the final string. I know I want as many '0's as possible at the start.  Since '0's and '2's maintain their relative order, I need to create a subsequence containing all the '0's and '2's, preserving their original order.  All the '1's can be put somewhere in this subsequence. Since they are flexible, I need to determine the best place for them. \n\nTo minimize lexicographically, it seems like the best thing to do is to put all of the '0's at the beginning. Then all the '1's, and finally all the '2's. However, the order of '0's and '2's is fixed. I need to make sure I don't violate this constraint.\n\nI should count the number of '1's. Then form a string containing the '0's and '2's in their correct relative order. To make the smallest string, I want to insert the '1's as far left as possible.  I realize that the optimal placement is right before the first '2' in the string. If there are no '2's, then all of the '1's should be added at the end. Otherwise, I will get a string with the structure: \"0's\" + \"1's\" + \"2's\" (and the order of 0s and 2s are preserved, and all 1s are grouped together right before the first 2). That's my algorithm.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by repeatedly swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. We cannot swap '0' and '2'.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' <-> '1': A '0' can move past a '1', and a '1' can move past a '0'.\n2. '1' <-> '2': A '1' can move past a '2', and a '2' can move past a '1'.\n\nCrucially, '0' and '2' cannot directly swap. Can they swap indirectly?\nConsider a sequence \"012\".\n- Swapping '0' and '1': \"102\". Now '0' is between '1' and '2'.\n- Swapping '1' and '2': \"021\". Now '2' is between '0' and '1'.\nFrom \"021\", we cannot swap '0' and '2'. We can swap '2' and '1' to get \"012\" back.\nFrom \"102\", we cannot swap '0' and '2'. We can swap '1' and '0' to get \"012\" back.\n\nThis demonstrates that '0's and '2's cannot move past each other. Their relative order is fixed. If an original string contains `...0...2...`, then in any reachable string, that specific '0' must still appear before that specific '2'. Similarly, if it contains `...2...0...`, that '2' must appear before that '0'.\n\nOn the other hand, '1's are very flexible:\n- A '1' can move left past any '0' (e.g., \"01\" -> \"10\").\n- A '1' can move right past any '2' (e.g., \"12\" -> \"21\").\nThis means a '1' can effectively move past any '0' or '2'. All '1's can be grouped together and placed at any position relative to the '0's and '2's, without affecting the relative order of the '0's and '2's.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nGiven that '0's and '2's maintain their relative order, we can construct the final string as follows:\n1. Extract all '0's and '2's from the input string, preserving their original relative order. Let's call this sequence `s_no_ones`.\n2. Count all '1's in the input string. Let this be `num_ones`.\n3. Now, we need to insert `num_ones` '1's into `s_no_ones` to make the resulting string lexicographically smallest.\n   To achieve this, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\n   The '1's should be placed:\n   - After all '0's that are not forced to appear after a '2'.\n   - Before all '2's.\n\nThis means the optimal position for the block of '1's is right before the *first '2'* character in `s_no_ones`.\n- If `s_no_ones` contains no '2's (i.e., it's all '0's), then all '0's come first, followed by all '1's.\n- If `s_no_ones` contains '2's, let `first_two_idx` be the index of the first '2'.\n  - The substring `s_no_ones[0:first_two_idx]` consists entirely of '0's (these are '0's that appear before any '2' in the fixed `0`/`2` sequence). These '0's can be at the very beginning of the final string.\n  - The substring `s_no_ones[first_two_idx:]` starts with the first '2' and contains all subsequent '0's and '2's. These must appear after the '1's.\n  - Therefore, the '1's should be inserted between these two parts.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n1. Iterate through the input string `s`.\n2. Collect all '0's and '2's into a list (or string builder) `s_no_ones_chars`.\n3. Count the total number of '1's (`num_ones`).\n4. Convert `s_no_ones_chars` into a string `s_no_ones_str`.\n5. Find the index of the first occurrence of '2' in `s_no_ones_str`.\n   - If '2' is not found: The result is `s_no_ones_str` followed by `num_ones` '1's.\n   - If '2' is found at `first_two_idx`: The result is `s_no_ones_str[0:first_two_idx]` (all '0's before the first '2'), followed by `num_ones` '1's, followed by `s_no_ones_str[first_two_idx:]` (the first '2' and everything after it).\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `s_no_ones_chars = []`, `num_ones = 0`\n2. Iterating:\n   - '1': `num_ones = 1`\n   - '0': `s_no_ones_chars = ['0']`\n   - '0': `s_no_ones_chars = ['0', '0']`\n   - '2': `s_no_ones_chars = ['0', '0', '2']`\n   - '1': `num_ones = 2`\n   - '0': `s_no_ones_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n3. `s_no_ones_str = \"0020\"`\n4. `first_two_idx` for '2' in \"0020\" is `2`.\n5. Result: `s_no_ones_str[0:2]` (`\"00\"`) + `('1' * 2)` (`\"11\"`) + `s_no_ones_str[2:]` (`\"20\"`) = `\"001120\"`.\n\nThis approach ensures that the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved, and all '1's are positioned to make the string lexicographically minimal.\n\nThe time complexity will be O(N) for iterating through the string and building `s_no_ones_chars`, O(N) for joining characters into a string, O(N) for finding the index of '2', and O(N) for string concatenations. The total time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(N) for storing `s_no_ones_chars` and the resulting string. Given N up to $10^5$, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    s_no_ones_chars = []\n    num_ones = 0\n\n    # Separate '0's and '2's from '1's\n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else:\n            s_no_ones_chars.append(char_s)\n    \n    s_no_ones_str = \"\".join(s_no_ones_chars)\n    \n    # Find the position to insert '1's\n    # All '1's should be placed after '0's and before '2's if possible.\n    # The relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\n    # So, '1's should be inserted right before the first '2' in s_no_ones_str.\n    \n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i in range(len(s_no_ones_str)):\n        if s_no_ones_str[i] == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n            \n    result_parts = []\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        # No '2's in the string.
