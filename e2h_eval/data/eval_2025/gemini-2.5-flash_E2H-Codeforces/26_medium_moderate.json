Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan to tackle this triangle counting problem:**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. I have integer sides `x`, `y`, and `z` where `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`. The crucial thing is that this is a *non-degenerate* triangle, so I have to satisfy the triangle inequality, which boils down to `x + y > z` given the ordering. The code should iterate through possible values of `x`, `y` and `z`.  A key insight is that `x` and `y` will define a lower bound, and upper bound for `z`. Since I need a script, I will have to start by determining the bounds and then iterate. I should consider avoiding redundant calculations.\n\nA naive approach would be a triple loop, testing each combination, which would be `O((B-A+1)(C-B+1)(D-C+1))`, but that gets really slow when the ranges are large. Therefore, I need a more optimized strategy.\n\nI have a plan to optimize. For each combination of `x` and `y`, I can determine the valid range of `z` values. Instead of iterating `z`, I can calculate the number of valid `z` values directly, which might give me an efficiency boost. I'll need a way to combine constraints: `C <= z <= D` and `z < x+y`. My approach needs to consider all combinations of `x` and `y` while calculating the number of valid `z` values, which might give me an opportunity to use a single loop to calculate the values.\n\nI'll iterate over the sum of sides `s = x + y`, which gives me an upper bound on `z`. This will give me `O(D)` time complexity, which should be fast enough.\n\nTo do this, I will need a counting method for each value of `s`.\nI'll also have to calculate `x_min`, `x_max`, `num_xy` values within the loops to determine a working range.\n\nI need a Python script to do this. I'll initialize a `total_triangles` counter, and then I'll use a loop to check the conditions and calculate the number of valid triples `(x, y, z)`. The key part is to derive `x_min` and `x_max`, the range within which `x` will have to exist given the value of `s`. Using these variables, I will also have to ensure `num_xy` is calculated to make sure x exists in the range, and `num_z` to calculate the number of `z` within the range based on `z_min` and `z_max`.\nFinally, I will have to add the `num_xy * num_z` to find the final value.\n\nLet me try a few examples to make sure the edge cases work.  The logic is solid, and I think it's optimized enough to meet the time constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, and `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D` holds.\n\nFirst, let's establish the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle with sides `x, y, z`:\n1. Triangle inequality: `x + y > z`, `x + z > y`, and `y + z > x`.\n2. All sides must be positive: `x > 0, y > 0, z > 0`.\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, and `A >= 1`, all sides `x, y, z` are guaranteed to be positive.\nAlso, because `x <= y <= z`:\n- `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`, we have `x + z >= 1 + y > y`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n- `y + z > x`: Since `y >= x` and `z >= C >= A >= 1`, we have `y + z >= y + 1 > y >= x`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to explicitly check is `x + y > z`. This can be rewritten as `z < x + y`, or `z <= x + y - 1` since `z` must be an integer.\n\nSo, the complete set of conditions for `x, y, z` is:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `z <= x + y - 1`\n\nA naive approach of iterating through all possible `x`, `y`, `z` values would be `O((B-A+1)(C-B+1)(D-C+1))`. Given `D` can be up to `5 * 10^5`, this could be `(5*10^5)^3` in the worst case, which is too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach. Let's fix `x` and `y` first. For each pair `(x, y)` satisfying `A <= x <= B` and `B <= y <= C`, we need to count `z` values such that `C <= z <= D` and `z <= x + y - 1`.\nCombining these, `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nThe number of such `z` values for a fixed `(x, y)` pair is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThis reduces the problem to `O((B-A+1)(C-B+1))`, which can still be up to `(5*10^5)^2 = 2.5 * 10^{11}` in the worst case (e.g., `A=1, B=2.5*10^5, C=5*10^5`), still too slow.\n\nLet's optimize further by iterating over the sum `s = x + y`.\nThe minimum possible value for `s` is `A + B` (when `x=A, y=B`).\nThe maximum possible value for `s` is `B + C` (when `x=B, y=C`).\nSo `s` ranges from `A + B` to `B + C`. The maximum value for `B + C` is `5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`. This range for `s` is manageable.\n\nFor a fixed `s = x + y`:\n1. **Count valid `(x, y)` pairs:**\n   We have `A <= x <= B` and `B <= y <= C`.\n   Since `y = s - x`, the condition `B <= y <= C` becomes `B <= s - x <= C`.\n   This can be split into two inequalities:\n   - `s - x >= B  =>  x <= s - B`\n   - `s - x <= C  =>  x >= s - C`\n   So, `x` must satisfy `max(A, s - C) <= x <= min(B, s - B)`.\n   Let `x_min_for_s = max(A, s - C)` and `x_max_for_s = min(B, s - B)`.\n   The number of valid `x` values (and thus `(x, y)` pairs) for this `s` is `num_xy_pairs = max(0, x_max_for_s - x_min_for_s + 1)`.\n\n2. **Count valid `z` values:**\n   For any `(x, y)` pair that sums to `s`, `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= D` and `z <= s - 1`.\n   Combining these, `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= min(D, s - 1)`.\n   Let `z_min_for_s = C` and `z_max_for_s = min(D, s - 1)`.\n   The number of valid `z` values for this `s` is `num_z_values = max(0, z_max_for_s - z_min_for_s + 1)`.\n\nThe total number of triangles is the sum of `num_xy_pairs * num_z_values` for all possible `s`:\n`Total Triangles = sum_{s=A+B}^{B+C} (num_xy_pairs(s) * num_z_values(s))`\n\nThe loop for `s` runs from `A+B` to `B+C`, which is at most `10^6` iterations. Inside the loop, calculations are `O(1)`. This makes the total time complexity `O(B+C)`, which is efficient enough (roughly `10^6` operations). Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle potentially large `total_triangles` values.\n\nExample walk-through: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n`s` ranges from `A+B=3` to `B+C=5`.\n\n- For `s = 3`:\n  - `x_min_for_s = max(A, s-C) = max(1, 3-3) = 1`\n  - `x_max_for_s = min(B, s-B) = min(2, 3-2) = 1`\n  - `num_xy_pairs = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1`. (Only `(x,y)=(1,2)` satisfies `1<=1<=2`, `2<=2<=3`, `1+2=3`).\n  - `z_min_for_s = C = 3`\n  - `z_max_for_s = min(D, s-1) = min(4, 3-1) = 2`\n  - `num_z_values = max(0, 2 - 3 + 1) = 0`. (No `z` values in `[3, 2]`).\n  - `total_triangles += 1 * 0 = 0`.\n\n- For `s = 4`:\n  - `x_min_for_s = max(A, s-C) = max(1, 4-3) = 1`\n  - `x_max_for_s = min(B, s-B) = min(2, 4-2) = 2`\n  - `num_xy_pairs = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2`. (Pairs `(1,3)` and `(2,2)` satisfy `x` range `[1,2]`, `y` range `[2,3]`, sum to 4).\n  - `z_min_for_s = C = 3`\n  - `z_max_for_s = min(D, s-1) = min(4, 4-1) = 3`\n  - `num_z_values = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1`. (Only `z=3` satisfies `3<=z<=3`).\n  - `total_triangles += 2 * 1 = 2`. (Triangles: `(1,3,3)`, `(2,2,3)`).\n\n- For `s = 5`:\n  - `x_min_for_s = max(A, s-C) = max(1, 5-3) = 2`\n  - `x_max_for_s = min(B, s-B) = min(2, 5-2) = 2`\n  - `num_xy_pairs = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1`. (Only `(x,y)=(2,3)` satisfies `1<=2<=2`, `2<=3<=3`, `2+3=5`).\n  - `z_min_for_s = C = 3`\n  - `z_max_for_s = min(D, s-1) = min(4, 5-1) = 4`\n  - `num_z_values = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2`. (Values `z=3, 4` satisfy `3<=z<=4`).\n  - `total_triangles += 1 * 2 = 2`. (Triangles: `(2,3,3)`, `(2,3,4)`).\n\nTotal triangles = `0 + 2 + 2 = 4`.
