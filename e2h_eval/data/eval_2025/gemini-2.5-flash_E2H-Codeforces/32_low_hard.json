Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Array Stabilization**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Array Stabilization\" problem.  The goal is to remove one element from an array of integers and minimize the instability, which is just the difference between the max and min values of the remaining array.  Seems pretty straightforward, but let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints: array size up to 10^5 and element values also up to 10^5.  That gives me some room for a linear or near-linear time solution.\n\nThe key insight here is that the *absolute* values of the elements don't really matter.  What I'm concerned with is the spread or range.  So, I immediately think of sorting the array.  Sorting makes finding the minimum and maximum incredibly easy.  Let's call the sorted array `a_sorted`.\n\nNow, if I remove an element, the new minimum and maximum *must* be among the remaining elements.  I realize there are only a few *critical* scenarios:\n\n*   **Remove the smallest element:**  The new min is the second-smallest element, and the max is unchanged (still the largest).\n*   **Remove the largest element:**  The new max is the second-largest element, and the min is unchanged (still the smallest).\n*   **Remove any other element:** Removing anything in the \"middle\" won't affect the range because the original min and max remain.\n\nSo, I don't actually need to consider every possible removal. The critical cases are removing the smallest or largest elements.  If I remove the smallest, the instability is `s_n - s_2`. If I remove the largest, it's `s_{n-1} - s_1`. If I remove anything else it is the original `s_n - s_1`.\n\nComparing these, I know that `s_n - s_1` (removing the middle element) is always greater than or equal to both `s_n - s_2` (removing the smallest element) and `s_{n-1} - s_1` (removing the largest element). This means I only have to compare the latter two possibilities to find the minimum instability!  I'll just sort, compute those two differences, and pick the smaller one. Done! This is likely an O(n log n) solution due to sorting, which is well within the time limits.\n",
