There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Approach**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Zoning Restrictions Again,\" and I need a Python solution. The setup is this: `n` spots where houses can be built, each with a maximum height `h`. If a house has a height of `a`, the profit is `a^2`. The catch? We have `m` restrictions, each defined as `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`. This means that from spot `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive), the *tallest* house cannot exceed `x_i`. The goal is to maximize the total profit.\n\nWith those small constraints, like `n, h, m <= 50`, I'm guessing a polynomial time solution is the way to go – likely something along the lines of `N^3`, `N * H` or similar. I'll need to figure out the best height, `H[j]`, for each spot `j` (from 1 to `n`) while following all the height restrictions, where the objective is to maximize the sum of `H[j]^2`.\n\nLet's dive into the restrictions. I need to make sure that each spot's height, `H[j]`, is within the range `0 <= H[j] <= h`. Also, for every restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`, I need to ensure that the maximum height in that range (`max(H[j] for j in l_i...r_i)`) is less than or equal to `x_i`. This means that for any specific spot `j`, its height cannot be higher than a certain value. In fact, `H[j]` can't go over `x_i` if `j` is within the range of any restriction `i`.\n\nThis brings me to the core insight. Each house's height is bounded by the *minimum* of two things: the global height limit (`h`) and the limits imposed by the restrictions. So, I'll need to calculate this upper bound, let's call it `max_allowed_height[j]`, for each spot `j`. Initially, this maximum height will be the global limit, `h`. Then, as I go through each restriction, I'll update it by comparing it with the restriction's height limit (`x_i`), whenever spot `j` falls within the restriction's range (`l_i` to `r_i`). I can then update `max_allowed_height[j] = min(max_allowed_height[j], x_i)`. This step basically identifies the tightest upper bound on each house's height, factoring in all relevant restrictions.\n\nOnce I have the upper bounds figured out, it's straightforward. Because the objective function is a quadratic (i.e., `H[j]^2`), and is strictly increasing for non-negative values, it's best to maximize `H[j]`. So, for each spot `j`, I'll set its height to its maximum allowed height: `H[j] = max_allowed_height[j]`.\n\nFinally, the total profit is simply the sum of each spot's profit. So I'll calculate `sum(H[j]^2)` and print it.\n\n**Implementation Plan and Complexity Analysis**\n\nThis strategy turns out to be relatively easy to implement in Python.\n\n1.  I'll start by making an array named `max_height_for_spot` of size `n`. Initialize all the values to `h`.\n2.  Next, I'll go through each restriction and, using a simple loop, update the `max_height_for_spot` array. Specifically, for each spot `j` within the restriction's range, I'll update `max_height_for_spot[j-1]` (remember to adjust for the 0-based indexing) to `min(max_height_for_spot[j-1], x_i)`.\n3.  Then, I'll compute the total profit by summing the squares of the final heights in the `max_height_for_spot` array.\n\nNow, let's analyze the time complexity. The initialization step takes `O(n)`. Processing each of the `m` restrictions takes, in the worst case, `O(n)` time (when the restriction covers all spots from 1 to `n`). So, the total time complexity for processing restrictions is `O(m * n)`. The final calculation of the total profit again takes `O(n)`. So, the overall time complexity is `O(n + m * n + n)`, or simply `O(m *",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine the maximum profit from building houses on `n` spots, subject to a global maximum height `h` and `m` zoning restrictions. Each restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` states that the tallest house in the range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`. The profit from a house of height `a` is `a^2`.\n\nLet `H[j]` be the height of the house at spot `j`. We want to maximize `sum(H[j]^2)` for `j` from `1` to `n`. Since `H[j]` must be an integer between `0` and `h`, and `a^2` is an increasing function for `a >= 0`, to maximize the sum, we should maximize each `H[j]` independently.\n\nLet's analyze the restrictions:\nA restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` states that `max(H[j] for j in l_i...r_i) <= x_i`.\nThis condition is equivalent to saying that `H[j] <= x_i` for *every* `j` in the range `[l_i, r_i]`.\nIf there was any `k` in `[l_i, r_i]` such that `H[k] > x_i`, then `max(H[j] for j in l_i...r_i)` would be at least `H[k]`, which would be greater than `x_i`, violating the restriction.\nConversely, if `H[j] <= x_i` for all `j` in `[l_i, r_i]`, then the maximum of these heights must also be less than or equal to `x_i`.\n\nTherefore, for each spot `j`, its height `H[j]` must satisfy two types of constraints:\n1.  Global height limit: `0 <= H[j] <= h`.\n2.  Zoning restrictions: For every restriction `(l_k, r_k, x_k)` that covers spot `j` (i.e., `l_k <= j <= r_k`), `H[j]` must be `H[j] <= x_k`.\n\nCombining these, the maximum possible height for a house at spot `j` is `min(h, min(x_k for all restrictions k where l_k <= j <= r_k))`.\nLet's call this value `max_allowed_height[j]`.\n\nTo maximize the total profit `sum(H[j]^2)`, we should choose `H[j] = max_allowed_height[j]` for each spot `j`. This choice satisfies all individual constraints and also all range constraints, because if `H[j] <= x_k` for all `j` in `[l_k, r_k]`, then `max(H[j] for j in l_k...r_k) <= x_k` is automatically satisfied.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize an array `max_height_for_spot` of size `n`. Each element `max_height_for_spot[j]` will store the current maximum allowed height for spot `j+1` (using 0-indexed array for 1-indexed spots). Initialize all elements to `h`.\n2.  For each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\n    Iterate through the spots `j` from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive). For each such spot, update `max_height_for_spot[j-1] = min(max_height_for_spot[j-1], x_i)`. (Remember to convert `l_i` and `r_i` to 0-indexed by subtracting 1).\n3.  After processing all restrictions, `max_height_for_spot[j]` will hold the globally maximum possible height for house `j+1`.\n4.  Calculate the total profit by summing `max_height_for_spot[j]^2` for all `j` from `0` to `n-1`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions: `(1, 1, 1)`, `(2, 2, 3)`, `(3, 3, 2)`\n\n1.  Initialize `max_height_for_spot = [3, 3, 3]` (all `h`).\n\n2.  Process restrictions:\n    *   Restriction `(1, 1, 1)`:\n        For spot 1 (index 0): `max_height_for_spot[0] = min(max_height_for_spot[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n        `max_height_for_spot` is now `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   Restriction `(2, 2, 3)`:\n        For spot 2 (index 1): `max_height_for_spot[1] = min(max_height_for_spot[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n        `max_height_for_spot` is still `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   Restriction `(3, 3, 2)`:\n        For spot 3 (index 2): `max_height_for_spot[2] = min(max_height_for_spot[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n        `max_height_for_spot` is now `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\n3.  All restrictions processed. Final heights are `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\n4.  Calculate total profit:\n    `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Time Complexity: Initializing `max_height_for_spot` takes `O(n)`. Processing `m` restrictions involves a loop that iterates up to `n` times for each restriction. So, this step is `O(m * n)`. Calculating the total profit takes `O(n)`. Total time complexity is `O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n)`. Given `n, m <= 50`, `50 * 50 = 2500` operations, which is very efficient.\n*   Space Complexity: `O(n)` for storing `max_height_for_spot`. Given `n <= 50`, this is negligible.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, h, m from the first line of input\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize an array to store the maximum allowed height for each spot.\n    # Initially, every spot can have a house of height up to 'h'.\n    # The array is 0-indexed, so max_height_for_spot[i] corresponds to spot i+1.\n    max_height_for_spot = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each of the 'm' zoning restrictions\n    for _ in range(m):\n        # Read the restriction parameters: left limit (l), right limit (r), and max height (x)\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Adjust 'l' and 'r' to be 0-indexed for array access.\n        # Spots are 1 to n, so array indices are 0 to n-1.\n        l_idx = l - 1\n        r_idx = r - 1\n\n        # Apply the restriction:\n        # For every spot 'i' within the range [l_idx, r_idx],\n        # its height must be at most 'x'.\n        # We update the max_height_for_spot[i] to be the minimum of its current value\n        # and 'x'.
