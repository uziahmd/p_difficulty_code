Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Vanya and Lanterns - My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. It's about lighting up a street of length `l` with `n` lanterns. Each lantern at position `a_i` lights up a segment of radius `d`. The goal is the minimum `d` to light the entire street.\n\nMy first thought is that the order of the lanterns matters. It makes calculating the unlit gaps way easier if I can sort the lantern positions. I'll start by sorting the lantern positions from smallest to largest, calling them `a_1`, `a_2`, ... `a_n`.\n\nNow, the entire street `[0, l]` needs to be covered. I've broken this down into these critical segments and gaps that need attention.\n\nFirst, I consider the beginning and the end. I need the first lantern's light to reach the start of the street, and the last lantern's light to reach the end.\n\n*   To cover the start, the lantern at `a_1` must extend to 0. This means `d >= a_1`.\n*   Similarly, for the end, the lantern at `a_n` must extend to `l`. That means `d >= l - a_n`.\n\nThen, I'm thinking about the gaps between adjacent lanterns. I know that if `d` is too small, there will be unlit spots in these gaps. For two adjacent lanterns at `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, I need to find the minimum `d` that will cover the segment between them. The lantern at `a_i` reaches `a_i + d`, and the lantern at `a_{i+1}` reaches `a_{i+1} - d`. To cover the gap, `a_i + d` must be greater or equal to `a_{i+1} - d`. This simplifies to `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.\n\nTo ensure the street is fully covered, I need `d` to satisfy all three conditions at once. Therefore, my minimum `d` will be the *maximum* of these three values: `a_1`, `l - a_n`, and the maximum value of `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` across all pairs.\n\nI then went through the example they gave me.\n\nI need to make sure this also holds for edge cases, like when there's only one lantern, when lanterns are at the very beginning or end of the street, or when there are multiple lanterns at the same location. It seems sorting handles it all pretty well.\n\nI'm making sure to implement the calculations as floats to ensure precision. The problem requests an answer with an absolute or relative error not exceeding `10^-9`. A double-precision float is more than sufficient. I'll make sure to use a format string to print the answer.\n\nI double-checked a couple of the test cases to ensure I have the right answer.\n\nI'm confident this logic will produce the correct answer. I will now code this up and submit.\n",
