A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm looking at this \"Soft Drinking\" problem and immediately start mapping out the process. It's a classic resource allocation problem, and I can see the structure immediately. I've got this input with various resources: drinks, limes, and salt, along with the number of friends and how much of each resource each friend needs for a toast. The goal is to maximize the number of toasts they can all make together.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the calculations for each resource. With the drink, it's just the total milliliters from the bottles divided by the milliliters needed per toast. Same for the lime slices – total slices divided by the slices needed per toast. Salt is similar: total grams divided by the grams needed per toast.\n\nThen, the critical realization hits: the *bottleneck* determines the maximum number of toasts. I've got to take the minimum value from those individual calculations because that's the absolute limit. You can't make more toasts than the least plentiful resource allows.\n\nFinally, I need to remember that there are multiple friends. The number I get from finding the minimum is the total number of toasts, and I need to divide that by the number of friends. This will ensure that they all get the same number. Integer division is key here because you can't have fractional toasts!\n\nI also notice the constraints quickly. They’re relatively small, so brute force solutions shouldn't be an issue. Let's see how this plays out in code. The walkthrough helps solidify my understanding of the step-by-step logic, and now I'm ready to write a Python script that implements this efficiently.\n",
