Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**X-Shaped Grid Verification**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to analyze a character grid and determine if it forms an 'X' shape, according to some well-defined rules. The grid is `n x n`, where `n` is an odd number between 3 and 300.  The crux of this problem lies in efficiently verifying these conditions.\n\nMy plan is to read in the grid, represented as a 2D list.  I'll start by checking the diagonals. I'll initialize a `diag_char` variable with the first element on the main diagonal. Then I will check all diagonal characters to see that all the diagonal characters match the character I defined at the start.  Then I'll look at the non-diagonal elements. I'll set up a variable, `non_diag_char`, to hold the character present in the non-diagonal cells and compare the characters as I go.\n\nI'll iterate through each cell, `(r, c)`, of the grid. If a cell is on either the main or anti-diagonal (`r == c` or `r + c == n - 1`), I will compare its character to `diag_char`. If there's a mismatch, I'll immediately output \"NO\" and halt execution because one of the primary constraints is violated.\n\nIf a cell is *not* on a diagonal, I'll compare it to `non_diag_char`.  If `non_diag_char` is still `None` (meaning this is the first non-diagonal character found), I will set it to the current cell's character. If it's *not* `None`, I'll compare the cell's character to `non_diag_char`. A mismatch here means \"NO\", and again, I stop.\n\nAfter the complete iteration, if I haven't hit a \"NO\" condition, I need to check the final piece of the puzzle: the diagonal character, `diag_char`, *must* be different from the non-diagonal character, `non_diag_char`.  If they are the same, it's not an 'X', so \"NO\". Otherwise, it's an 'X', and I print \"YES\".\n\nSo, the algorithm:\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Read the grid.\n3.  Initialize `diag_char`.\n4.  Iterate and check diagonals. If mismatch, print \"NO\".\n5.  Iterate and check non-diagonals. If mismatch, print \"NO\".\n6.  Finally, check if `diag_char != non_diag_char`. Print \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.\n\nA quick example:\nWith `n = 3` and the grid `[['w', 's', 'w'], ['s', 'w', 's'], ['w', 's', 'w']]`, I'll set `diag_char` to 'w' and `non_diag_char` to 's'.  The algorithm should correctly determine that this is an 'X'.\n",
