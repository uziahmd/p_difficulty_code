Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solution Synthesis: Vanya and Cards Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Vanya and Cards.\" The gist is this: Vanya's got some cards with numbers on them, and he wants the total sum of all the numbers to be zero. The catch? He can only use numbers with an absolute value up to 'x'. He has *n* cards and needs to determine how many more cards to use.\n\nFirst, I need to grasp the input format: I get the number of cards Vanya already has (`n`) and the maximum absolute value (`x`). Then I get the list of numbers on the cards.\n\nNext, I have to figure out the right way to approach this.  I need to calculate the sum of the numbers on the initial cards (`current_sum`). If `current_sum` is zero, I'm done – no additional cards needed. If it's not zero, I need to figure out what value to get to zero. The needed absolute sum, `target_value`, is just the absolute value of `current_sum`.\n\nNow, here's the smart part: to minimize the number of cards, I need to use the largest possible values allowed, which is `x`. I divide the target value (`target_value`) by `x` and use a `ceil` function (the smallest integer greater than or equal to the decimal quotient) to find the minimum number of cards.\n\nSince I am coding in Python, an integer division solution of the `ceil` function comes naturally in this case. In integer arithmetic for positive integers `a` and `b`, `ceil(a/b)` can be calculated as `(a + b - 1) // b`.\n\nI'll check a few edge cases: If the `current_sum` is zero, the answer is zero. If the target sum is just 1 or -1 and `x` is 1, the result is still just one.\n\nThe time complexity will be O(n) due to summing the initial numbers and will be very fast due to the constraints.\n",
