The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Xenia and the Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem.  The goal is to minimize the total travel time for Xenia to complete a series of tasks on a circular road.  I need to write a Python script for this.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the problem. We have `n` houses (numbered 1 to `n`) and `m` tasks. Each task `a_i` specifies the house Xenia needs to go to in the `i`-th task.  Movement is clockwise only, and it takes one unit of time to move to an adjacent house. Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete the tasks in the given order.\n\nTo solve this, I'll need to calculate the time to move from the current house to the target house for each task. The core logic will be based on whether the target house is clockwise from the current house or involves wrapping around the circle.\n\nIf the target house (`target_pos`) is greater than or equal to the current house (`current_pos`), the time is simply `target_pos - current_pos`.  If the target house is smaller, then we need to wrap around. The time is then calculated as `(n - current_pos) + target_pos`. It's important to remember this is equivalent to moving to house n, and then house 1, and then to the target house.\n\nI'll iterate through the tasks, keeping track of Xenia's current position and accumulating the total time. I'll need to initialize Xenia's position to 1.  It's pretty straightforward, actually, but I'll double check the edge cases and my formula logic before I call it done.  Let's get this code written!\n",
