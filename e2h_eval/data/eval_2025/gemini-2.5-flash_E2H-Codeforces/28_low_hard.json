String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Decoding the Beautiful String Logic**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem, and it's got me thinking. The goal is to count \"beautiful strings\" based on some specific modification rules.  Let's break this down. First, I need to generate strings containing '0's and '1's, with a fixed number of each.  The challenge lies in determining if a string can be reduced to a single character, `g`, through a series of operations.\n\nThe core of the problem is this modification rule. It keeps replacing the last two characters with a new one.  After a bit of analysis, I've realized that the resulting character isn't a simple XOR or parity check. Instead, the operation hinges on whether both of the characters are '0'. If they are, it becomes a '1'; otherwise, it becomes a '0'. I've tried to represent it algebraically and found `(1 - c1) * (1 - c2)` is the accurate function. This represents the NAND logic with an inversion.\n\nNow I need to use this function to check if any given string, through the repeated application of the modification, can be reduced down to the target character, `g`. I need to figure out an efficient way to determine the truthiness of all of these states. Then, I can start counting the valid strings!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of binary strings with `n` zeros and `m` ones that can be reduced to a single character `g` using a specific modification operation. The modification operation replaces the last two characters of a string: `00 -> 1`, `01 -> 0`, `10 -> 0`, `11 -> 0`. This process continues until only one character remains.\n\nLet's analyze the operation. We can represent '0' as 0 and '1' as 1. The operation `(c1, c2)` results in `1` if `c1=0` and `c2=0`, and `0` otherwise. This is equivalent to `(1-c1)(1-c2)`.\n\nConsider the effect of the operation on the string's length and the characters. The operation always reduces the string length by one. After `N-1` operations (where `N` is the initial length), a single character will remain. The order of operations matters if we consider different pairs, but the problem specifies \"replace two last characters\". This means we always reduce `s[k-1]s[k]` to `s'[k-1]`, then `s'[k-2]s'[k-1]` to `s''[k-2]`, and so on, effectively processing the string from right to left.\n\nLet's denote the value of a string `s` as `V(s)`.\n`V(c) = c` for a single character `c`.\n`V(s_1 s_2 ... s_k)` is computed by `V(s_1 ... s_{k-2} \\text{op}(s_{k-1}, s_k))`.\nLet `f(c_1, c_2) = (1-c_1)(1-c_2)`.\nThen `V(s_1 s_2 ... s_k) = f(s_1, f(s_2, ..., f(s_{k-1}, s_k)...))`.\nThis is `f(s_1, f(s_2, V(s_3 ... s_k)))`.\n\nLet's analyze `f(x, y)`:\n- `f(0, y) = 1 * (1-y) = 1-y`. So `f(0,0)=1`, `f(0,1)=0`.\n- `f(1, y) = 0 * (1-y) = 0`. So `f(1,0)=0`, `f(1,1)=0`.\n\nThis means if the first character `s_1` is '1', the result will always be '0', regardless of the rest of the string.\n`V(1 s_2 ... s_k) = f(1, V(s_2 ... s_k)) = 0`.\nSo, if `g=1`, the string must start with '0'.\nIf `g=0`, the string can start with '0' or '1'. If it starts with '1', it automatically reduces to '0'.\n\nNow consider the case where `s_1 = 0`.\n`V(0 s_2 ... s_k) = f(0, V(s_2 ... s_k)) = 1 - V(s_2 ... s_k)`.\nThis means if the string starts with '0', the final character is the complement of the final character of the string `s_2 ... s_k`.\nLet `s = c_1 c_2 ... c_L`.\n`V(s) = c_1 \\oplus c_2 \\oplus ... \\oplus c_L` where `\\oplus` is XOR if `c_i` are boolean values (0/1).\nHowever, the operation is `f(c_1, c_2) = (1-c_1)(1-c_2)`.\nLet's define `val(c_1 ... c_k) = c_1 \\text{ op } (c_2 \\text{ op } (... \\text{ op } c_k)...)`.\nIf `c_1 = 1`, `val(1...) = 0`.\nIf `c_1 = 0`, `val(0 c_2...) = 1 - val(c_2...)`.\nThis implies that `val(c_1 c_2 ... c_k)` is `c_1` if `k=1`.\nFor `k > 1`:\n`val(c_1 ... c_k) = c_1 \\text{ op } val(c_2 ... c_k)`.\nLet `X = val(c_2 ... c_k)`.\nIf `c_1 = 1`, `val(...) = 0`.\nIf `c_1 = 0`, `val(...) = 1 - X`.\n\nSo, the final character `g` depends on the first character `s_1` and the final character of the suffix `s_2 ... s_L`.\nLet `S_0` be the count of '0's and `S_1` be the count of '1's in `s_2 ... s_L`.\nThe number of '0's in `s_2 ... s_L` is `n` or `n-1`.\nThe number of '1's in `s_2 ... s_L` is `m` or `m-1`.\n\nThis recursive definition `V(0s') = 1 - V(s')` and `V(1s') = 0` is crucial.\nLet `k` be the number of leading zeros in the string. `s = 0...01...` or `s = 0...0`.\nIf `s = 0^k X` where `X` is either empty or starts with `1`.\n`V(0^k X) = 1 - V(0^{k-1} X) = 1 - (1 - V(0^{k-2} X)) = ...`.\nIf `k` is even, `V(0^k X) = V(X)`.\nIf `k` is odd, `V(0^k X) = 1 - V(X)`.\nIf `X` is empty, then `s = 0^k`.\n`V(0^k) = 0` if `k` is even and `k > 0`. (e.g., `V(00)=1`, `V(0000)=1`). This is not right.\n`V(0) = 0`.\n`V(00) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n`V(000) = f(0, V(00)) = f(0,1) = 0`.\n`V(0000) = f(0, V(000)) = f(0,0) = 1`.\nSo, `V(0^k) = 0` if `k` is odd, `1` if `k` is even and `k > 0`.\nAnd `V(0^k 1...) = 0` if `k` is even.\n`V(0^k 1...) = 1` if `k` is odd.\nThis can be summarized as: `V(s) = (count of 0s that are NOT followed by 0) % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 1`\nThis is still not precise.\n\nLet's use the property `V(c_1 ... c_k) = c_1 \\text{ op } (c_2 \\text{ op } ... (c_{k-1} \\text{ op } c_k)...)`.\nThe number of '1's in the string is `m`.\nThe problem states the final character `g` must be obtained.\n\nCase 1: `m = 0`. The string is `00...0` (`n` zeros).\n- If `n=0`, `m=0`, `n+m=0` (not allowed, `n+m >= 1`).\n- If `n=1`, `s=\"0\"`. `V(\"0\") = 0`. So if `g=0`, count=1. If `g=1`, count=0.\n- If `n > 1`: `V(0^n) = 1` if `n` is even, `0` if `n` is odd.\n  - If `g=0`: count=1 if `n` is odd, 0 if `n` is even.\n  - If `g=1`: count=1 if `n` is even, 0 if `n` is odd.\n\nCase 2: `m > 0`. The string contains at least one '1'.\nLet `k` be the number of '0's that appear before the first '1'.\n`s = 0...01...` (`k` zeros, then the first '1').\n`V(s) = V(0^k 1...)`.\nIf `k` is even: `V(0^k 1...) = V(1...)`.\nIf `k` is odd: `V(0^k 1...) = 1 - V(1...)`.\nSince the string `1...` starts with '1', `V(1...) = 0`.\nSo, if `k` is even, `V(s) = 0`.\nIf `k` is odd, `V(s) = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n\nThis means if `m > 0`:\n- The final character `g` is `0` if the number of leading zeros is even.\n- The final character `g` is `1` if the number of leading zeros is odd.\n\nThis is a very simple rule! Let's verify with examples.\nExample 1: `n=1, m=1, g=0`.\nStrings: \"01\", \"10\".\n- For \"01\": leading zeros `k=1` (odd). `V(\"01\") = 1`. Not `g=0`.\n- For \"10\": leading zeros `k=0` (even). `V(\"10\") = 0`. Matches `g=0`.\nCount = 1. Wait, example output is 2. My rule is wrong.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the operation `f(c1, c2) = (1-c1)(1-c2)`.\n`V(s_1 s_2 ... s_L) = f(s_1, f(s_2, f(s_3, ..., f(s_{L-1}, s_L)...)))`. This is right-associative.\nThis means `s_L` and `s_{L-1}` are replaced, then that result with `s_{L-2}`, etc.\nLet `s = c_1 c_2 ... c_L`.\n`r_L = c_L`.\n`r_{L-1} = f(c_{L-1}, r_L)`.\n`r_{L-2} = f(c_{L-2}, r_{L-1})`.\n...\n`r_1 = f(c_1, r_2)`.\nThe final character is `r_1`.\n\nLet `x_i` be the character `c_i`.\n`r_k = f(x_k, r_{k+1})`.\n- If `x_k = 1`, then `r_k = f(1, r_{k+1}) = 0`.\n- If `x_k = 0`, then `r_k = f(0, r_{k+1}) = 1 - r_{k+1}`.\n\nSo, if any `x_k = 1`, then `r_k = 0`. And `r_{k-1} = f(x_{k-1}, 0)`.\nIf `x_{k-1}=1`, `r_{k-1}=0`.\nIf `x_{k-1}=0`, `r_{k-1}=f(0,0)=1`.\n\nThis is equivalent to: `r_k = 0` if `x_k = 1`.\nIf `x_k = 0`, `r_k = 1 - r_{k+1}`.\nThis means `r_k = (1 - x_k) \\oplus r_{k+1}` (where `\\oplus` is XOR if `x_k` is 0/1, `1-x_k` is 1/0).\nIf `x_k = 0`: `r_k = 1 \\oplus r_{k+1}` (i.e. `1 - r_{k+1}`).\nIf `x_k = 1`: `r_k = 0 \\oplus r_{k+1}` (i.e. `0`).\nThis is `r_k = (1-x_k) \\cdot (1 \\oplus r_{k+1})` if we want to combine.\n\nLet `N_0` be the number of '0's and `N_1` be the number of '1's.\nThe final character `g` depends on the rightmost '1'.\nLet `s = S_0 1 S_1`, where `S_0` is some prefix, `1` is the rightmost '1', and `S_1` is a suffix of only '0's.\n`S_1` consists of `k` zeros. `s = S_0 1 0^k`.\n`r_{L-k} = V(1 0^k)`.\n`V(0) = 0`.\n`V(1) = 1`.\n`V(00) = 1`.\n`V(10) = f(1, V(0)) = f(1,0) = 0`.\n`V(01) = f(0, V(1)) = f(0,1) = 0`.\n`V(11) = f(1, V(1)) = f(1,1) = 0`.\n`V(001) = f(0, V(01)) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n`V(010) = f(0, V(10)) = f(0,0) = 1`.\n`V(100) = f(1, V(00)) = f(1,1) = 0`.\n\nLet's compute `V(1 0^k)`:\n`V(1 0^0) = V(1) = 1`.\n`V(1 0^1) = V(10) = 0`.\n`V(1 0^2) = V(100) = f(1, V(00)) = f(1,1) = 0`.\n`V(1 0^k) = 0` for `k >= 1`.\n`V(1 0^k) = 1` for `k = 0`.\n\nSo, `V(S_0 1 0^k)`:\nIf `k=0` (string ends with '1'): `s = S_0 1`.\n`V(S_0 1) = f(s_1, f(s_2, ..., f(s_{L-1}, 1)...))`.\nThe crucial observation: if any character `c_i` is '1', then `r_i = 0`.\n`r_i = f(c_i, r_{i+1})`. If `c_i = 1`, then `r_i = f(1, r_{i+1}) = 0`.\nThis means if there is any '1' in the string, the \"value\" `r_i` at its position will be `0`.\nLet `j` be the index of the last '1'. `c_j = 1`.\nThen `r_j = f(c_j, r_{j+1}) = f(1, V(c_{j+1}...c_L))`.\nSince `c_{j+1}...c_L` only contains '0's, `V(c_{j+1}...c_L)` is `V(0^{L-j})`.\n`V(0^k) = 0` if `k` is odd, `1` if `k` is even and `k > 0`.\n`V(0^0) = 0` (base case `V(\"\")` is not defined, but `V(c_j)` is `c_j`).\nIf `L-j = 0`, then `V(c_j) = c_j = 1`. So `r_j = 1`.\nIf `L-j > 0`: `V(0^{L-j})` is `0` or `1`.\nThen `r_j = f(1, V(0^{L-j})) = 0`.\nSo, if the string ends with '1' (`j=L`), then `r_L = 1`.\nIf the string ends with '0' (`j < L`), then `r_j = 0`.\n\nNow we have `r_j`. We need to compute `r_1`.\n`r_i = f(c_i, r_{i+1})`.\nFor `i < j`, `c_i` must be '0' (because `j` is the index of the last '1').\nSo for `i < j`, `r_i = f(0, r_{i+1}) = 1 - r_{i+1}`.\nThis means `r_1 = (1 - r_2) = (1 - (1 - r_3)) = r_3 = ...`.\nThe value flips for each '0' to the left of `c_j`.\n`r_1 = r_j` if `j-1` is even.\n`r_1 = 1 - r_j` if `j-1` is odd.\n`j-1` is the number of '0's before the last '1'. Let this be `N_0_before_last_1`.\n\nSummary:\n1. If `m = 0` (string is `0^n`):\n   - `V(0^n) = 0` if `n` is odd.\n   - `V(0^n) = 1` if `n` is even and `n > 0`.\n   - `V(0) = 0`.\n   This is equivalent to: `V(0^n) = (n+1)%2` if `n>0`. If `n=0`, it's not possible.\n   So, if `g=0`: Count=1 if `n` is odd.\n   If `g=1`: Count=1 if `n` is even and `n > 0`.\n\n2. If `m > 0` (string has at least one '1'):\n   Let `j` be the index of the last '1'.\n   Let `k = L-j` be the number of trailing '0's.\n   Let `cnt0 = j-1` be the number of '0's before the last '1'.\n   - If `k=0` (string ends with '1'): `r_j = 1`.\n     `V(s) = r_1 = r_j` if `cnt0` is even.\n     `V(s) = r_1 = 1 - r_j` if `cnt0` is odd.\n     So `V(s) = 1` if `cnt0` is even.\n     `V(s) = 0` if `cnt0` is odd.\n     `V(s) = (cnt0 % 2 == 0)`.\n   - If `k > 0` (string ends with '0'): `r_j = 0`.\n     `V(s) = r_1 = r_j` if `cnt0` is even.\n     `V(s) = r_1 = 1 - r_j` if `cnt0` is odd.\n     So `V(s) = 0` if `cnt0` is even.\n     `V(s) = 1` if `cnt0` is odd.\n     `V(s) = (cnt0 % 2 != 0)`.\n\nThis can be summarized for `m > 0`:\nThe final character `g` is `0` if (`number of 0s before last 1` is odd AND `string ends with 1`) OR (`number of 0s before last 1` is even AND `string ends with 0`).\nThe final character `g` is `1` if (`number of 0s before last 1` is even AND `string ends with 1`) OR (`number of 0s before last 1` is odd AND `string ends with 0`).\n\nThis rule can be simplified: `g = (L_0 % 2) \\oplus (E_0 % 2)`, where `L_0` is count of zeros before last 1, and `E_0` is 0 if ends with 1, 1 if ends with 0.\n`g = (cnt0 % 2) != (k == 0)`.\nSo if `cnt0 % 2 == 0`: `g = (k == 0)`.\nIf `cnt0 % 2 == 1`: `g = (k != 0)`.\n\nLet `N_0_before_last_1` be `i`.\nLet `N_0_after_last_1` be `j`.\nThe remaining `n - i - j` zeros and `m-1` ones can be placed anywhere between the first character and the last '1'.\nThe total number of zeros is `n`.

This matches example output. My derived rule `V(s) = (cnt0 % 2 != (k == 0))` is correct for `m>0`.\n\n`n=1, m=1, g=1`.\nFrom above, both \"01\" and \"10\" reduce to `g=0`. So count is 0.

This is the number of zeros in the middle part.\n`j = n-i-k`.\nThe sum becomes `sum_{i=0 to n} sum_{k=0 to n-i} C(k+m-1, m-1) * (1 if condition met else 0)`.\n`i` is `cnt0`. `j` is `k_trailing`.\n`k_trailing = n-i-k`.\n\nLet's rewrite the conditions based on `i` (zeros before last '1') and `k_trailing` (zeros after last '1').\n`g=0`: `(i % 2 == 1 && k_trailing > 0)` OR `(i % 2 == 0 && k_trailing == 0)`.\n`g=1`: `(i % 2 == 0 && k_trailing > 0)` OR `(i % 2 == 1 && k_trailing == 0)`.\n\nLet `N_mid = n-i-k_trailing`.\nWe need to sum `C(N_mid + m-1, m-1)` for valid `i, k_trailing`.\n`i` goes from `0` to `n`.\n`k_trailing` goes from `0` to `n-i`.\n\nLet `S_0` be the sum for `i` even.\nLet `S_1` be the sum for `i` odd.\n\n`S_0_j0 = sum_{i even, i <= n} C(n-i+m-1, m-1)` (where `k_trailing=0`).\n`S_0_jpos = sum_{i even, i <= n} sum_{k_trailing=1 to n-i} C(n-i-k_trailing+m-1, m-1)`.\n`S_1_j0 = sum_{i odd, i <= n} C(n-i+m-1, m-1)` (where `k_trailing=0`).\n`S_1_jpos = sum_{i odd, i <= n} sum_{k_trailing=1 to n-i} C(n-i-k_trailing+m-1, m-1)`.\n\nIf `g=0`: `ans = (S_1_jpos + S_0_j0) % MOD`.\nIf `g=1`: `ans = (S_0_jpos + S_1_j0) % MOD`.\n\nLet's simplify `sum_{k_trailing=1 to n-i} C(n-i-k_trailing+m-1, m-1)`.\nLet `X = n-i`.\nThe sum is `sum_{k_trailing=1 to X} C(X-k_trailing+m-1, m-1)`.\nLet `p = X-k_trailing`. As `k_trailing` goes from `1` to `X`, `p` goes from `X-1` down to `0`.\nSo this is `sum_{p=0 to X-1} C(p+m-1, m-1)`.\n\nIdentity: `sum_{k=r to N} C(k, r) = C(N+1, r+1)`.\nHere `r = m-1`.\n`sum_{p=0 to X-1} C(p+m-1, m-1) = sum_{p'=m-1 to X-1+m-1} C(p', m-1)`.\nThis sum is `C(X-1+m-1+1, m-1+1) - C(m-1, m-1)` if we sum from `p'=0`.\nIt is `C(X+m-1, m)`. This is a known identity `sum_{k=0 to N} C(k+R, R) = C(N+R+1, R+1)`.\nSo `sum_{p=0 to X-1} C(p+m-1, m-1) = C((X-1)+m-1+1, m-1+1) = C(X+m-1, m)`.\nThis is valid if `m-1 >= 0`, i.e., `m >= 1`. This is true for this case.\n\nSo `S_0_jpos = sum_{i even, i <= n} C(n-i+m-1, m)`.\nAnd `S_1_jpos = sum_{i odd, i <= n} C(n-i+m-1, m)`.\n\nNow we need to compute these sums efficiently.\n`S_0_j0 = sum_{i even, i <= n} C(n-i+m-1, m-1)`.\n`S_1_j0 = sum_{i odd, i <= n} C(n-i+m-1, m-1)`.\n`S_0_jpos = sum_{i even, i <= n} C(n-i+m-1, m)`.\n`S_1_jpos = sum_{i odd, i <= n} C(n-i+m-1, m)`.\n\nLet `A = n+m-1`.\n`S_0_j0 = sum_{i even, i <= n} C(A-i, m-1)`.\n`S_1_j0 = sum_{i odd, i <= n} C(A-i, m-1)`.\n`S_0_jpos = sum_{i even, i <= n} C(A-i, m)`.\n`S_1_jpos = sum_{i odd, i <= n} C(A-i, m)`.\n\nThese sums can be computed by iterating `i` from `0` to `n`. `O(N)` time.\nThe maximum value for `n-i+m-1` is `n+m-1`. Max `m` is `10^5`.\nCombinations `C(N, K)` where `K` can be up to `10^5`.\nThis approach is `O(N+M + log MOD)` for precomputation and `O(N)` for sums. Total `O(N+M)`.\n\nFinal check of edge cases:\n`n=0, m=0` is not allowed.\n`n=1, m=0, g=0`: `m=0` case, `n=1` odd. `g=0` means `ans=1`. Correct.\n`n=1, m=0, g=1`: `m=0` case, `n=1` odd. `g=1` means `ans=0`. Correct.\n\nWhat if `m-1 < 0`? This means `m=0`, which is handled by a separate case.\nWhat if `m-1 = 0` (i.e., `m=1`)?\nThen `C(X, m-1) = C(X, 0) = 1`.\nAnd `C(X, m) = C(X, 1) = X`.\nSo `S_0_j0 = sum_{i even, i <= n} 1`. This is `floor(n/2)+1` if `n` is even, `floor(n/2)+1` if `n` is odd.\nCorrect. `(n/2)+1` for `n` even, `(n+1)/2` for `n` odd. Or `(n/2)+1` if `n` is even, `(n+1)/2` if `n` is odd.\nNumber of even `i` in `[0, n]` is `floor(n/2)+1`.\nNumber of odd `i` in `[0, n]` is `floor((n-1)/2)+1`.\n\n`S_0_jpos = sum_{i even, i <= n} C(n-i+m-1, m)`.\nIf `m=1`, this becomes `sum_{i even, i <= n} (n-i)`.\nThis sum is `(n) + (n-2) + (n-4) + ...`.\nIf `n` is even: `n + (n-2) + ... + 0`. Sum is `n(n/2+1)/2`.\nIf `n` is odd: `n + (n-2) + ... + 1`. Sum is `(n+1)((n+1)/2)/2`.\nThese are arithmetic series sums.\n\nThe general sums `sum C(A-i, K)` can be computed by iterating `i`.\nThe maximum value for `A-i` is `n+m-1`.\nThe maximum value for `K` is `m` or `m-1`.\nAll `C(N, K)` calls are valid.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 1000000007\n\nMAX_N_PLUS_M = 2 * 10**5 + 5 # Max n+m is 2*10^5\nfact = [1] * MAX_N_PLUS_M\ninv_fact = [1] * MAX_N_PLUS_M\n\ndef precompute_factorials():\n    for i in range(1, MAX_N_PLUS_M):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i-1] * i) % MOD\n    inv_fact[MAX_N_PLUS_M - 1] = pow(fact[MAX_N_PLUS_M - 1], MOD - 2, MOD)\n    for i in range(MAX_N_PLUS_M - 2, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = (inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n\ndef nCr_mod_p(n, r):\n    if r < 0 or r > n:\n        return 0\n    num = fact[n]\n    den = (inv_fact[r] * inv_fact[n-r]) % MOD\n    return (num * den) % MOD\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m, g = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    precompute_factorials()\n\n    ans = 0\n\n    # Case 1: m = 0 (string consists only of '0's)\n    if m == 0:\n        if n == 0: # n+m >= 1, so this case is not possible\n            pass\n        elif n == 1: # \"0\"\n            if g == 0:\n                ans = 1\n            else:\n                ans = 0\n        else: # n > 1, string is \"0^n\"\n            # V(\"0^n\") = 0 if n is odd, 1 if n is even\n            if (n % 2 == 1 and g == 0) or (n % 2 == 0 and g == 1):\n                ans = 1\n            else:\n                ans = 0\n        sys.stdout.write(str(ans) + '\\n')\n        return\n\n    # Case 2: m > 0 (string contains at least one '1')\n    # The rule is: g = (i % 2 != (j == 0))\n    # where i = number of 0s before last '1' (cnt0)\n    #       j = number of 0s after last '1' (k_trailing)\n    #\n    # We need to sum C(n_mid + m_mid, m_mid)\n    # where n_mid = n - i - j\n    #       m_mid = m - 1\n\n    # Sums for i even:\n    S0_j0 = 0 # i even, j = 0 (ends with '1')\n    S0_jpos = 0 # i even, j > 0 (ends with '0')\n\n    # Sums for i odd:\n    S1_j0 = 0 # i odd, j = 0 (ends with '1')\n    S1_jpos = 0 # i odd, j > 0 (ends with '0')\n\n    # Iterate i (number of 0s before last '1')\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        # Contribution for j = 0 (string ends with '1')\n        # n_mid = n - i - 0 = n - i\n        # m_mid = m - 1\n        # Number of ways for middle part: C(n-i + m-1, m-1)\n        ways_j0 = nCr_mod_p(n - i + m - 1, m - 1)\n        if i % 2 == 0: # i is even\n            S0_j0 = (S0_j0 + ways_j0) % MOD\n        else: # i is odd\n            S1_j0 = (S1_j0 + ways_j0) % MOD\n\n        # Contribution for j > 0 (string ends with '0')\n        # This sum is sum_{j=1 to n-i} C(n-i-j + m-1, m-1)\n        # Using identity sum_{p=0 to X-1} C(p + R, R) = C(X + R, R+1)\n        # Here X = n-i, R = m-1\n        # So sum is C((n-i) + (m-1), (m-1)+1) = C(n-i+m-1, m)\n        if n - i >= 1: # Only sum if there's at least one trailing zero possible\n            ways_jpos = nCr_mod_p(n - i + m - 1, m)\n            if i % 2 == 0: # i is even\n                S0_jpos = (S0_jpos + ways_jpos) % MOD\n            else: # i is odd\n                S1_jpos = (S1_jpos + ways_jpos) % MOD\n        \n    # Calculate final answer based on g\n    if g == 0:\n        # Condition for g=0: (i % 2 == 1 and j > 0) OR (i % 2 == 0 and j == 0)\n        ans = (S1_jpos + S0_j0) % MOD\n    else: # g == 1\n        # Condition for g=1: (i % 2 == 0 and j > 0) OR (i % 2 == 1 and j == 0)\n        ans = (S0_jpos + S1_j0) % MOD\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
