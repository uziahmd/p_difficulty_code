    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for Finding the Longest Repeated Substring**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this competitive programming problem. The goal is to identify the length of the longest substring within a given string that appears at least twice, allowing for overlapping occurrences. The string only contains lowercase letters, and its maximum length is 100.\n\nMy initial thought is to break this down. First, I need to consider all possible substring lengths, ranging from 1 up to N-1 (where N is the length of the string).  If the substring has a length of N, it can only occur once.\n\nFor each length, I'll need to generate and examine every possible substring of that specific length.  For a string 's' of length N, substrings of length 'L' will begin at indices from 0 up to N-L. The substring itself will be s[i:i+L].\n\nNow comes the crucial part: determining if a substring actually appears at least twice. My first instinct is to count occurrences. I could iterate through the string again, looking for instances of the substring at different starting positions (j != i). Since overlaps are allowed, I need to find any j where the substring s[j:j+L] matches.\n\nGiven the constraint that the string length is at most 100, a brute-force approach seems feasible.\n\nHere's my refined algorithm idea:\n\nI'll start with max_len = 0. Then, I will iterate the substring lengths L from 1 to N-1.  For each length L, I will iterate through all possible starting indices i from 0 to N-L.  The substring 'sub' would be s[i:i+L].\n\nTo check for a second occurrence, I will iterate through all possible starting positions j from 0 to N-L. If j == i, I'll skip it, because it is the same starting position. Then, I'll check if the substring s[j:j+L] is equal to sub. If this condition is true, I've found a repeated substring. I'll update max_len to be the maximum of its current value and L.  Since I am looking for the longest substring and I found a substring of length L at least twice, I can stop the inner j loop. But for now I'll keep the design more robust.\n\nAnalyzing the complexity, the nested loops will go up to N.  The string comparison s[j:j+L] == sub will take O(L) time. Therefore, the overall complexity seems to be O(N * N * N * L) which is O(N^4). For N=100, this is 10^8 which might be slow. So, I will have to refine this check. Maybe using string methods would be better.\n",
