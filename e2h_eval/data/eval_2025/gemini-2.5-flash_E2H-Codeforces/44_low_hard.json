He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down Polycarp's Practice: A Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Polycarp's Practice\" problem, and my first thought is, this seems like a classic optimization problem with a greedy flavor. I've got `n` problems, `k` days, and each day involves a *contiguous* segment of problems. The goal is to maximize the *total profit*, which is the sum of the maximum difficulty problem solved each day.\n\nThe core insight here is that to get the absolute biggest total profit, I need to somehow make sure the *biggest* difficulties show up as the daily maxima. I mean, it's obvious, right? Maximize the biggest daily profits to maximize the total profit.\n\nLet me break it down: I need to consider those `k` largest difficulty problems. If I can, somehow, allocate each of these as the maximum of a day, and then slice the other problems in between, I'll hit that max profit. Let's say the k largest values are M1 >= M2 >= ... >= Mk. The target would then be to obtain sum(Mi) as the total profit.\n\nSo, how do I actually *get* that partition? The key is splitting the list. If I can, essentially, split the array right after each of the k largest values, I'll be set. I can partition just after each of these values, and by construction, those problems will be the maximums for their respective days. The remaining problems can then be appended to the earlier groups.\n\nEssentially, I need to identify the `k` largest values and find the best places to insert the split points. Finding the best split positions is all about ensuring those top values become daily maximums.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to partition `n` problems, given as a list of difficulties `a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous segments. Each segment represents problems solved on one day. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved that day. We want to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output this maximum profit along with the lengths of the `k` segments.\n\n**Key Idea to Maximize Total Profit:**\n\nTo maximize the sum of `k` daily maximums, we should choose the `k` largest difficulties from the entire list `a`. Let these `k` largest difficulties be `M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_k`. The maximum possible total profit will be `sum(M_i)`.\n\nWhy is this true?\nConsider any valid partition of problems into `k` days. Let the maximum difficulty for day `j` be `P_j`. The total profit is `sum(P_j)`. Each `P_j` must be one of the `a_i` values. Since there are `k` days, there are `k` such `P_j` values. Each `P_j` is less than or equal to the largest difficulty in its segment. If we pick the `k` largest overall difficulties from the `a` array, say `M_1 \\ge M_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge M_k`, then `sum(P_j)` can be at most `sum(M_j)`. This is because each `P_j` is some `a_x`, and the set `{P_1, \\dots, P_k}` can contain at most `k` distinct values from `a`. The sum of these `k` values cannot exceed the sum of the `k` largest values in `a`.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible total profit is the sum of the `k` largest difficulties in the array `a`.\n\n**Constructing the Solution:**\n\n1.  **Find the `k` largest difficulties:**\n    *   Create a list of tuples `(difficulty, original_index)` for each problem.\n    *   Sort this list in descending order based on difficulty.\n    *   Take the first `k` elements from the sorted list. These represent the `k` largest difficulties.\n    *   Calculate their sum, which is our maximum total profit.\n\n2.  **Determine the split points:**\n    *   From the `k` largest difficulties identified, collect their original indices. Let these indices be `idx_1, idx_2, \\dots, idx_k`.\n    *   Sort these `k` indices in ascending order. These sorted indices `s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k` represent the positions of the chosen `k` maximum problems in the original array.\n    *   To ensure each of these `k` problems becomes the maximum of its respective day, we can make a split *just after* each of the first `k-1` chosen problems.\n    *   The split points will be `s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_{k-1}` (using 0-based indexing for `a`).\n    *   The first day solves problems from index `0` up to `s_1`.\n    *   The second day solves problems from index `s_1 + 1` up to `s_2`.\n    *   ...\n    *   The `j`-th day solves problems from index `s_{j-1} + 1` up to `s_j`.\n    *   The `k`-th day solves problems from index `s_{k-1} + 1` up to `n-1`.\n\n3.  **Calculate segment lengths:**\n    *   The length of the first segment is `s_1 + 1`.\n    *   The length of the `j`-th segment (for `j > 1`) is `s_j - s_{j-1}`.\n    *   The length of the `k`-th segment is `n - (s_{k-1} + 1)`.\n    *   More simply, the lengths are: `s_1 + 1`, `s_2 - s_1`, `s_3 - s_2`, ..., `s_{k-1} - s_{k-2}`, `n - (s_{k-1} + 1)`.\n    *   An alternative way to think about it: the split points are *after* indices `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{k-1}`.\n        *   Day 1: problems `a[0]` to `a[s_1]`. Length: `s_1 - 0 + 1`.\n        *   Day 2: problems `a[s_1+1]` to `a[s_2]`. Length: `s_2 - (s_1+1) + 1 = s_2 - s_1`.\n        *   ...\n        *   Day `k-1`: problems `a[s_{k-2}+1]` to `a[s_{k-1}]`. Length: `s_{k-1} - s_{k-2}`.\n        *   Day `k`: problems `a[s_{k-1}+1]` to `a[n-1]`. Length: `(n-1) - (s_{k-1}+1) + 1 = n - (s_{k-1}+1)`.\n\n    Let's use a list `splits` to store the 0-based indices *after which* a day ends.\n    So, `splits` will contain `s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_{k-1}`.\n    The lengths `t_j` will be:\n    `t_1 = splits[0] + 1`\n    `t_j = splits[j-1] - splits[j-2]` for `j` from `2` to `k-1`.\n    `t_k = n - (splits[k-2] + 1)` (or `n - splits[-1]` if `splits` is 0-indexed and contains `k-1` elements, meaning `splits[-1]` is `s_{k-1}`).\n\n    Let's refine the lengths calculation:\n    `t_1 = s_1 + 1`\n    `t_2 = s_2 - s_1`\n    ...\n    `t_{k-1} = s_{k-1} - s_{k-2}`\n    `t_k = n - s_{k-1} - 1` (This is wrong. It should be `n - (s_{k-1} + 1)` problems, which is `n - s_{k-1} - 1`. No, it's `n - (last_split_index + 1)` problems. If `s_{k-1}` is the last split index, then the problems `s_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1` are solved. The count is `(n-1) - (s_{k-1}+1) + 1 = n - s_{k-1} - 1`. This is still off by 1.\n    The number of problems from index `i` to `j` (inclusive) is `j - i + 1`.\n    So, for day `k`, problems are from `s_{k-1}+1` to `n-1`. Length is `(n-1) - (s_{k-1}+1) + 1 = n - s_{k-1} - 1`. This is correct.\n    Wait, `n - (s_{k-1} + 1)` is the number of problems *remaining* after `s_{k-1}`. This is `n - (s_{k-1} + 1)`.\n    Example: `n=8`, `s_1=2`, `s_2=4`. `k=3`.\n    `t_1 = s_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`. (Problems `a[0], a[1], a[2]`)\n    `t_2 = s_2 - s_1 = 4 - 2 = 2`. (Problems `a[3], a[4]`)\n    `t_3 = n - (s_2 + 1) = 8 - (4 + 1) = 8 - 5 = 3`. (Problems `a[5], a[6], a[7]`)\n    This logic seems correct.\n\nLet's trace the example: `n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Problems with indices:**\n    `(5, 0), (4, 1), (2, 2), (6, 3), (5, 4), (1, 5), (9, 6), (2, 7)`\n\n2.  **Sort by difficulty (descending):**\n    `(9, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0), (5, 4), (4, 1), (2, 2), (2, 7), (1, 5)`\n\n3.  **Take top `k=3`:**\n    `(9, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0)`\n    Maximum total profit = `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n\n4.  **Extract indices and sort:**\n    Original indices: `6, 3, 0`\n    Sorted indices (0-based): `s = [0, 3, 6]`\n\n5.  **Calculate segment lengths:**\n    `s_1 = s[0] = 0`\n    `s_2 = s[1] = 3`\n    `s_3 = s[2] = 6`\n\n    `t_1 = s[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`\n    `t_2 = s[1] - s[0] = 3 - 0 = 3`\n    `t_3 = n - (s[1] + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 4`\n    This gives `1, 3, 4`. Total profit `5+6+9=20`. This is a valid distribution `[5], [4,2,6], [5,1,9,2]`.\n    However, the example output is `3 2 3`. This means there can be multiple valid distributions.\n    The example distribution `[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]` has profit `5+6+9=20`.\n    The maximums are `a[0]=5`, `a[3]=6`, `a[6]=9`. Their indices are `0, 3, 6`. These are the same as our chosen indices.\n    The difference is how the segments are formed.\n    For `3 2 3`:\n    Day 1: `[5, 4, 2]` (length 3). Max is `a[0]=5`. End index `2`.\n    Day 2: `[6, 5]` (length 2). Max is `a[3]=6`. End index `4`.\n    Day 3: `[1, 9, 2]` (length 3). Max is `a[6]=9`. End index `7`.\n    The split points are after indices `2` and `4`.\n    The chosen maximums are `a[0]`, `a[3]`, `a[6]`.\n    The split points are `2, 4`.\n    Notice that the split points `2, 4` are *not* among the indices `0, 3, 6`.\n    The crucial part is that each of the `k` largest problems *must fall into a different day's segment*.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the split points. We need to make `k-1` cuts. These cuts divide the `n` problems into `k` segments. Each of the `k` largest values `M_1, \\dots, M_k` must be the maximum of one of these segments.\nA simpler strategy for split points:\nTake the `k` indices `s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k` (sorted) of the `k` largest problems.\nThe splits should occur *after* `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{k-1}`.\nNo, that's not quite right.\nIf `s_1, ..., s_k` are the sorted 0-based indices of the chosen `k` largest values.\nThe first segment must contain `a[s_1]`.\nThe second segment must contain `a[s_2]`.\n...\nThe `k`-th segment must contain `a[s_k]`.\n\nTo ensure this, we can make the cuts *after* `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{k-1}` if `s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_k`.\nConsider the `k` indices `s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k` (sorted). These are the indices of the `k` largest values.\nWe need to make `k-1` cuts. The most natural places to make cuts are *just after* the first `k-1` of these `k` special problems.\nSo, the cuts would be after index `s_1`, after index `s_2`, ..., after index `s_{k-1}`.\n\nLet's use the example `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`, `k=3`.\nLargest values are `9` (at index 6), `6` (at index 3), `5` (at index 0).\nSorted indices of these values: `s = [0, 3, 6]`.\nWe need `k-1 = 2` cuts.\nThe cuts should be after `s[0]` and after `s[1]`.\nCut 1: after index `s[0] = 0`.\nCut 2: after index `s[1] = 3`.\n\nSo, the split points are:\n`a[0]` (Day 1 ends)\n`a[1], a[2], a[3]` (Day 2 ends)\n`a[4], a[5], a[6], a[7]` (Day 3 ends)\n\nSegment lengths:\nDay 1: `0 - 0 + 1 = 1` problem. `[5]`. Max `5`.\nDay 2: `3 - (0+1) + 1 = 3` problems. `[4, 2, 6]`. Max `6`.\nDay 3: `7 - (3+1) + 1 = 4` problems. `[5, 1, 9, 2]`. Max `9`.\nLengths: `1, 3, 4`. Total profit `5+6+9=20`. This is a valid answer.\n\nThe example output `3 2 3` implies split points after index `2` and after index `4`.\n`a[0], a[1], a[2]` (Day 1 ends)\n`a[3], a[4]` (Day 2 ends)\n`a[5], a[6], a[7]` (Day 3 ends)\nThis also works. The maximums are `a[0]=5`, `a[3]=6`, `a[6]=9`. These are indeed the `k` largest values.\n\nIt seems that any set of `k-1` split points that ensures each of the `k` largest values falls into a distinct day's segment will work. The simplest way to define these split points is to use the indices of the `k` largest values themselves.\n\nLet's try to be precise:\n1.  Find the `k` largest values and their 0-based indices. Store them as `(value, index)` pairs.\n    Example: `(9, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0)`.\n2.  Sort these `k` pairs by their *indices* (ascending).\n    Example: `(5, 0), (6, 3), (9, 6)`.\n    Let these sorted indices be `idx_0, idx_1, \\dots, idx_{k-1}`.\n    For the example: `idx_0=0, idx_1=3, idx_2=6`.\n3.  The maximum total profit is the sum of the `k` values.\n    Example: `5 + 6 + 9 = 20`.\n4.  The lengths of the segments `t_1, \\dots, t_k`:\n    `t_1 = idx_0 + 1`\n    `t_j = idx_j - idx_{j-1}` for `j` from `1` to `k-1` (using `idx_j` for `s_j` notation above).\n    `t_k = n - (idx_{k-1} + 1)` (This is the number of problems remaining after the last selected 'max problem' segment).\n\n    Let's re-check `t_k` with the example: `n=8`, `idx_0=0, idx_1=3, idx_2=6`.\n    `t_1 = idx_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    `t_2 = idx_1 - idx_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n    `t_3 = n - idx_2 - 1 = 8 - 6 - 1 = 1`.\n    This gives `1, 3, 1`. Total `1+3+1 = 5`. This is wrong, it should be `n=8`.\n    The sum of `t_j` should be `n`.\n    `t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k = (idx_0 + 1) + (idx_1 - idx_0) + \\dots + (idx_{k-1} - idx_{k-2}) + t_k`\n    This simplifies to `idx_{k-1} + 1 + t_k`.\n    We need `idx_{k-1} + 1 + t_k = n`.\n    So, `t_k = n - (idx_{k-1} + 1)`. This is the correct formula for the *last* segment.\n\n    Let's apply this to `idx_0=0, idx_1=3, idx_2=6`:\n    `t_1 = idx_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    `t_2 = idx_1 - idx_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n    `t_3 = n - (idx_2 + 1) = 8 - (6 + 1) = 8 - 7 = 1`.\n    Lengths: `1, 3, 1`. Sum `1+3+1 = 5`. Still wrong. The sum must be `n=8`.\n\nWhat's wrong? The logic for `t_j = idx_j - idx_{j-1}` assumes that `idx_j` is the *end* of segment `j`. But `idx_j` is just *one problem* in segment `j`.\n\nLet's reconsider the split points. We have `k-1` internal split points.\n`0 ... split_1 | split_1+1 ... split_2 | ... | split_{k-1}+1 ... n-1`\nThe lengths are: `split_1 + 1`, `split_2 - split_1`, ..., `n - (split_{k-1} + 1)`.\nThe key is that each of the `k` largest values `a[idx_0], a[idx_1], \\dots, a[idx_{k-1}]` (where `idx` are sorted) must be the maximum of one segment.\nA simple way to achieve this is to make the cuts *after* `idx_0`, `idx_1`, ..., `idx_{k-2}`.\nNo, not `idx_0`. If we cut after `idx_0`, then `a[idx_0]` is in the first segment.\nIf we cut after `idx_1`, then `a[idx_1]` is in the second segment.\n...\nIf we cut after `idx_{k-1}`, then `a[idx_{k-1}]` is in the `k`-th segment.\nThis strategy ensures each chosen max is in its own segment.\nSo, the split points are `idx_0, idx_1, \\dots, idx_{k-1}`.\nWe need `k-1` cuts. So we choose `k-1` of these indices to be the split points.\nThe most flexible choice is to make the cuts *after* `idx_0`, `idx_1`, ..., `idx_{k-2}`.\nThis means:\nDay 1: problems from `0` to `idx_0`. Length `idx_0 + 1`.\nDay 2: problems from `idx_0+1` to `idx_1`. Length `idx_1 - idx_0`.\n...\nDay `k-1`: problems from `idx_{k-3}+1` to `idx_{k-2}`. Length `idx_{k-2} - idx_{k-3}`.\nDay `k`: problems from `idx_{k-2}+1` to `n-1`. Length `n - (idx_{k-2} + 1)`.\n\nLet's re-apply to `idx = [0, 3, 6]` for `n=8, k=3`.\n`k-1 = 2` cuts. We use `idx_0=0` and `idx_1=3` as split points.\n`t_1 = idx_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. (Problems `a[0]`)\n`t_2 = idx_1 - idx_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`. (Problems `a[1], a[2], a[3]`)\n`t_3 = n - (idx_1 + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 4`. (Problems `a[4], a[5], a[6], a[7]`)\nLengths: `1, 3, 4`. Sum `1+3+4 = 8`. This is `n`. This works!\nThis gives the output `1 3 4`. The example output `3 2 3` is also valid. Both yield `20`.\nSo, this method is correct and produces *a* valid solution.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the array `a`.\n3.  Create a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each element in `a`. `indexed_a = [(a[i], i) for i in range(n)]`.\n4.  Sort `indexed_a` in descending order based on `value`.\n5.  Select the first `k` elements from the sorted list. These are `k_largest_problems`.\n6.  Calculate `max_total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in k_largest_problems)`.\n7.  Extract the original indices of these `k` problems: `split_indices = [p[1] for p in k_largest_problems]`.\n8.  Sort `split_indices` in ascending order. These are `idx_0, idx_1, \\dots, idx_{k-1}`.\n9.  Initialize an empty list `segment_lengths`.\n10. Initialize `current_start_index = 0`.\n11. Iterate `j` from `0` to `k-2` (for the first `k-1` segments):\n    *   The end of this segment is `idx_j`.\n    *   The length is `idx_j - current_start_index + 1`.\n    *   Add this length to `segment_lengths`.\n    *   Update `current_start_index = idx_j + 1`.\n12. For the last segment (the `k`-th segment):\n    *   It starts at `current_start_index` and ends at `n-1`.\n    *   The length is `n - current_start_index`.\n    *   Add this length to `segment_lengths`.\n13. Print `max_total_profit`.\n14. Print `segment_lengths` joined by spaces.\n\nLet's dry run the example `n=8, k=3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]` again with this refined algorithm.\n\n1.  `n=8, k=3`.\n2.  `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`.\n3.  `indexed_a = [(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`.\n4.  Sorted `indexed_a` by value (descending):\n    `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`.\n5.  `k_largest_problems = [(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)]`.\n6.  `max_total_profit = 9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n7.  `split_indices = [6, 3, 0]`.\n8.  Sorted `split_indices`: `[0, 3, 6]`. Let's call them `idx_0=0, idx_1=3, idx_2=6`.\n9.  `segment_lengths = []`.\n10. `current_start_index = 0`.\n11. Loop `j` from `0` to `k-2` (`0` to `1`):\n    *   `j=0`: `idx_0 = 0`. Length = `idx_0 - current_start_index + 1 = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1`. `segment_lengths = [1]`. `current_start_index = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    *   `j=1`: `idx_1 = 3`. Length = `idx_1 - current_start_index + 1 = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`. `segment_lengths = [1, 3]`. `current_start_index = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n12. Last segment (k-th, i.e., 3rd segment):\n    *   Length = `n - current_start_index = 8 - 4 = 4`.\n    *   `segment_lengths = [1, 3, 4]`.\n13. Print `20`.\n14. Print `1 3 4`.\n\nThis output `1 3 4` is different from the example `3 2 3`, but it is a valid solution producing the same maximum total profit.\n\n**Constraints:**\n`1 <= k <= n <= 2000`\n`1 <= a_i <= 2000`\nSorting `n` elements takes `O(N log N)`. Extracting `k` elements and their indices is `O(k)`. Sorting `k` indices is `O(k log k)`.
