    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Algorithm Development**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to write a Python script that identifies the longest substring appearing at least twice within a given string. The substrings can overlap, and the input consists solely of lowercase Latin letters. The string length falls between 1 and 100 characters.\n\nLet's think this through. The obvious approach is to iterate through all possible substring lengths, starting with the longest possible (which is the string's length minus 1) and working downwards. If we find a duplicate at a particular length, we can return that length immediately, because we're iterating from longest to shortest, so it will be the longest. If we don't find any duplicate substrings of any length, we return 0.\n\nFor each substring length, we'll need to check all possible substrings of that length within the original string. The idea is to iterate through the string and extract substrings of the current length, and check if it exists in the rest of the string. So for string `S` of length `N`, the nested loops would go something like this:\n\n```\nFor L from N-1 down to 1:\n    For i from 0 to N-L:\n        substring = S[i:i+L]\n        For j from i+1 to N-L:\n            if S[j:j+L] == substring:\n                return L\n```\n\n**Complexity Analysis - The Brute-Force Approach**\n\nIf we implement the above, there's an outer loop that iterates `N-1` times (for different lengths), an inner loop that iterates `N-L` times, and a third, nested loop that is also roughly `N-L` times. String slicing itself is linear with the substring length, `O(L)`. String comparison is also `O(L)`. The overall complexity is therefore `O(N * N * N * L) = O(N^3 * L)` which is approximately `O(N^4)` where `N` is the string length. Since `N` is no more than `100`, this means up to `100^4 = 10^8` operations, which is at the limit and likely too slow in Python.\n\n**Optimization with a Set**\n\nTo optimize, instead of using the nested loops for duplicate checking, it would be much more efficient to store already-seen substrings of the same length in a set. Each substring is sliced from the original string and checked if it already exists in the set. If it already exists, return the current length `L`. Otherwise, add the substring to the set. This will make the duplicate checking a constant time (`O(1)` or really `O(L)`) operation.\n\n**Refined Algorithm (Using a Set)**\n\nHere's the refined algorithm using a set to improve duplicate detection:\n\n```\nInitialize max_len = 0\n\nFor L from N-1 down to 1:\n    seen_substrings = set()\n    For i from 0 to N-L:\n        substring = S[i:i+L]\n        if substring in seen_substrings:\n            return L\n        else:\n            add substring to seen_substrings\n```\n\n**Complexity Analysis (Optimized Approach)**\n\nIn this optimized version, the complexity becomes `O(N * N * L)` which is `O(N^3)`. Since `N` is up to `100`, it becomes `100^3 = 10^6` operations, which will run fast in Python.\n\n**Edge Cases**\n\nLet's think of the edge cases.\n- **String length 1:** A string with length 1 cannot contain a substring that appears at least twice, so the correct answer is `0`.\n- **String with no duplicates:** For a string with no repeated substrings (e.g., \"abcd\"), the algorithm should return `0`.\n- **Overlapping duplicates:** If the string contains overlapping duplicates (e.g., \"ababa\"), the correct length should be identified as the answer.\n- **Non-overlapping duplicates:** If the string contains non-overlapping duplicates (e.g., \"abcabc\"), the correct length should be found.\n\nThe algorithm should handle these cases properly.\n\n**Python Code Implementation**\n\nBased on the algorithm, the Python code can be written as:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for length in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        seen_substrings = set()\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            substring = s[i : i + length]\n            if substring in seen_",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap. The input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and has a length between 1 and 100.\n\nLet the given string be `S` and its length be `N`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Iterate through possible substring lengths in decreasing order:** We are looking for the *longest* such substring. So, it's efficient to check lengths from `N-1` down to `1`. The moment we find a duplicate substring for a certain length `L`, we know that `L` is our answer, because we're checking lengths in decreasing order. If no duplicate is found for any length, the answer is 0.\n    *   A substring of length `N` can only be the string itself, so it cannot appear twice. Thus, the maximum possible length for a duplicate substring is `N-1`.\n    *   The minimum possible length is `1`.\n\n2.  **For each length `L`:**\n    *   We need to check if any substring of length `L` appears at least twice.\n    *   To do this efficiently, we can iterate through all possible starting positions `i` for substrings of length `L`.\n    *   For each substring `S[i : i+L]`, we check if we have encountered this exact substring before at a different starting position.\n    *   A `set` data structure is ideal for this:\n        *   Initialize an empty `set`, `seen_substrings`.\n        *   For each `i` from `0` to `N-L` (inclusive):\n            *   Extract the substring `current_substring = S[i : i+L]`.\n            *   If `current_substring` is already in `seen_substrings`, it means we've found a duplicate. Since we're iterating `L` downwards, this `L` is the answer. Print `L` and terminate.\n            *   Otherwise, add `current_substring` to `seen_substrings`.\n\n3.  **If the loops complete:** If the program reaches this point, it means no duplicate substring was found for any length from `N-1` down to `1`. In this case, print `0`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`S = \"ababa\"`, `N = 5`):**\n\n*   **`length = 4`**:\n    *   `seen_substrings = {}`\n    *   `i = 0`: `substring = \"abab\"`. Add to `seen_substrings`. `seen_substrings = {\"abab\"}`.\n    *   `i = 1`: `substring = \"baba\"`. Add to `seen_substrings`. `seen_substrings = {\"abab\", \"baba\"}`.\n    *   No duplicates found for `length = 4`.\n*   **`length = 3`**:\n    *   `seen_substrings = {}`\n    *   `i = 0`: `substring = \"aba\"`. Add to `seen_substrings`. `seen_substrings = {\"aba\"}`.\n    *   `i = 1`: `substring = \"bab\"`. Add to `seen_substrings`. `seen_substrings = {\"aba\", \"bab\"}`.\n    *   `i = 2`: `substring = \"aba\"`. This substring is **in** `seen_substrings`!\n    *   A duplicate is found. Since `length = 3` is the longest we've checked so far (and we are iterating downwards), `3` is the answer. Print `3` and exit.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n\n*   The outer loop iterates `N-1` times (for `length`).\n*   The inner loop iterates `N-L` times (for `i`), which is at most `N` times.\n*   Inside the inner loop, substring slicing `S[i : i+L]` takes `O(L)` time. Set operations (`in` and `add`) for strings typically take `O(L)` time on average (due to string hashing and comparison).\n*   Therefore, the total time complexity is approximately `O(N * N * L)`, which simplifies to `O(N^3)`.\n*   Given `N <= 100`, `N^3 = 100^3 = 1,000,000`. This is efficient enough for typical time limits in competitive programming (usually allowing around `10^8` operations per second).\n\n**Input/Output Handling:**\n\nThe problem statement has a slightly ambiguous input example format. \"The first input line contains the string.\" suggests a single string. However, the example input `['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']` and output `['0', '3', '2']` strongly imply multiple test cases, where each line of input is a string, and for each string, a result is printed on a new line. We will implement the solution to handle multiple lines of input until EOF, processing each line as a separate test case.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Function to solve the problem for a single input string\ndef solve_for_string(s):\n    n = len(s)\n\n    # Iterate from longest possible substring length down to 1.\n    # A substring of length N can only appear once.\n    # So, the maximum length to check is N-1.\n    # If N=1, range(0, 0, -1) is empty, loop won't run, correctly returns 0.\n    for length in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        seen_substrings = set()\n        # Iterate through all possible starting positions for substrings of the current length.\n        # A substring of length 'length' starting at 'i' ends at 'i + length - 1'.\n        # The last possible starting index 'i' is when 'i + length - 1' is 'n - 1',\n        # which means 'i' is 'n - length'.\n        # So, 'i' ranges from 0 to 'n - length' (inclusive).\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            substring = s[i : i + length]\n            if substring in seen_substrings:\n                # If we find a duplicate substring of this length,\n                # it's the longest possible because we are iterating lengths downwards.\n                return length\n            else:\n                seen_substrings.add(substring)\n\n    # If no duplicate substring is found for any length, return 0.\n    return 0\n\n# Read input line by line from stdin until EOF\n# Each line is treated as a separate test case\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    s = line.strip()\n    # The problem guarantees non-empty strings, but a check for empty lines after stripping\n    # (e.g., if there's a blank line at the end of input) is good practice.\n    if s:\n        print(solve_for_string(s))\n\n```",
