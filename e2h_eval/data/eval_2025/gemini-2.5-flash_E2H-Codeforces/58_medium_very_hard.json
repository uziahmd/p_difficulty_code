You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Odd Cycle Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core is figuring out the minimum edges (`t`) to add to a graph to create an odd-length cycle, and how many ways (`w`) we can do it.  First, I'll need to check if the graph *already* has an odd cycle. If it does, then boom, `t` is zero, and `w` is one. Simple enough - just use BFS or DFS with 2-coloring to detect any inconsistencies (same color on connected nodes). If this check passes, I know the graph is bipartite.\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, I can't just slap down any edge and expect an odd cycle to magically appear.  The key here is that to get an odd cycle in a bipartite graph, the added edge MUST connect nodes within the *same* partition. So, if I find a component where either partition has at least two nodes, I can add *one* edge to make an odd cycle. This means `t = 1`, and the number of ways to do it will involve picking two nodes from the same partition in each applicable component.\n\nIf *no* component has a partition with at least two nodes, then all the connected components are either isolated vertices (one node) or single edges (two nodes connected).  In this scenario, I can't get away with just one edge. Here, I'm thinking I'll need at least two edges. There are two subcases:\n\n1.  If I've got an isolated vertex and an edge component, I can use two edges to form a 3-cycle. Say I have an isolated vertex, `u`, and an edge `v-w`. I can create a 3-cycle by adding `u-v` and `u-w`. So `t = 2`, and the number of ways is simply the count of isolated vertices * the count of edge components.\n\n2.  If I have at least two edge components, I can also add two edges to create a 3-cycle.  Suppose I've two edges, `u-v` and `x-y`. I'll pick a vertex from one edge (either `u` or `v`) and connect it to both vertices on the other edge. Thus adding edges `u-x` and `u-y` will form a 3-cycle `u-x-y-u`. So, `t = 2`, and the number of ways is computed based on the different combinations for connecting vertex from one edge to another, it comes out as the count of edge components * 2 (because there are two ways) * the number of remaining edge components.\n\nIf none of those options work, then I've got a graph that's either all isolated vertices, or only contains vertices and edges, or some combination. If I end up with ONLY isolated nodes, I'll need at least three edges to form a simple cycle.\n\nSo to recap:\n1.  Check for existing odd cycle, if it exists then `t=0`, `w=1`.\n2.  If bipartite and at least one component with a partition size >= 2: `t = 1`, and compute `w`.\n3.  Otherwise, if there exists an isolated vertex and an edge component: `t = 2`, and compute `w`.\n4.  Otherwise, if two edge components exist: `t = 2` and compute `w`.\n5.  If none of these, I may have isolated vertices only, and in this case, and if the number of nodes is less than 3, then it's `t = 3` and the total ways is `1`. Otherwise `t =3` and compute all combinations of three isolated vertices.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w` the number of ways to do so. We cannot add loops or parallel edges.\n\nThe core concept is that a graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite.\n\n**Step 1: Check for existing odd cycles (t = 0)**\nWe can determine if the graph contains an odd cycle by attempting to 2-color each connected component using BFS or DFS.\n- Initialize `color` array for all vertices to -1 (uncolored).\n- For each vertex `u` from 1 to `n`:\n    - If `u` is uncolored:\n        - Start a BFS/DFS from `u`. Assign `color[u] = 0`.\n        - Use a queue for BFS (or recursion stack for DFS).\n        - For each neighbor `v` of the current vertex `curr`:\n            - If `v` is uncolored: Assign `color[v] = 1 - color[curr]` and add `v` to the queue.\n            - If `v` is colored and `color[v] == color[curr]`: An odd cycle is found.\n                - In this case, `t = 0` and `w = 1`. We can immediately print `0 1` and terminate.\n\n**Step 2: Graph is bipartite (t > 0)**\nIf no odd cycle is found after checking all components, the graph is bipartite. We must add edges. During the 2-coloring process, for each connected component `C`, we can determine its bipartition `A_C` and `B_C`. Let `|A_C|` and `|B_C|` be the sizes of these partitions.\n\n**Case 2.1: Minimum 1 edge (t = 1)**\nAn odd cycle can be formed by adding a single edge `(u, v)` within an existing connected component `C` such that `u` and `v` belong to the same partition (e.g., both in `A_C`).\n- Iterate through all connected components `C` identified during the 2-coloring.\n- If `|A_C| >= 2`: We can choose two distinct vertices from `A_C` and add an edge between them. This forms an odd cycle. The number of ways for this component is `|A_C| * (|A_C| - 1) / 2`.\n- If `|B_C| >= 2`: Similarly, the number of ways is `|B_C| * (|B_C| - 1) / 2`.\n- Sum these ways across all components. Let this sum be `w_1`.\n- If `w_1 > 0`, then `t = 1` and `w = w_1`. Print `1 w_1` and terminate.\n\n**Case 2.2: Minimum 2 edges (t = 2)**\nIf `t=1` is not possible, it means for every connected component `C`, `max(|A_C|, |B_C|) = 1`. This implies each component is either:\n    - An isolated vertex (e.g., `|A_C|=1, |B_C|=0`).\n    - A single edge (e.g., `|A_C|=1, |B_C|=1`).\nLet's count these:\n- `N_iso`: Number of isolated vertices (components of size 1).\n- `N_edge_comp`: Number of components consisting of a single edge (components of size 2).\n\nWe can form a 3-cycle using two new edges. A common pattern for a 3-cycle is `X-Y-Z-X`.\n- **Option A: Connect an isolated vertex to an edge component.**\n    - Pick an isolated vertex `X`.\n    - Pick an edge component `Y-Z`.\n    - Add edges `(X, Y)` and `(X, Z)`. This forms the 3-cycle `X-Y-Z-X`.\n    - This requires `N_iso >= 1` and `N_edge_comp >= 1`.\n    - Number of ways: `N_iso * N_edge_comp`.\n- **Option B: Connect two edge components.**\n    - Pick an edge component `X-Y`.\n    - Pick a vertex from it (say `X`).\n    - Pick another distinct edge component `Z-W`.\n    - Add edges `(X, Z)` and `(X, W)`. This forms the 3-cycle `X-Z-W-X`.\n    - This requires `N_edge_comp >= 2`.\n    - Number of ways: `N_edge_comp * 2` (choose `X` or `Y` from the first component) `* (N_edge_comp - 1)` (choose the second component). Total `2 * N_edge_comp * (N_edge_comp - 1)`.\n\nNow, we determine `t=2` and `w`:\n- If `N_iso >= 1` and `N_edge_comp >= 1`:\n    - `t = 2`.\n    - `w = N_iso * N_edge_comp`.\n    - Print `2 w` and terminate.\n- Else if `N_edge_comp >= 2`: (This implies `N_iso` must be 0, otherwise Option A would have been taken.)\n    - `t = 2`.\n    - `w = 2 * N_edge_comp * (N_edge_comp - 1)`.\n    - Print `2 w` and terminate.\n\n**Case 2.3: Minimum 3 edges (t = 3)**\nIf `t=1` and `t=2` are not possible, it means we are in one of these scenarios:\n    - All components are isolated vertices (`N_edge_comp = 0`).\n    - All components are single edges, but there's only one (`N_edge_comp = 1`, `N_iso = 0`).\n\nWe can always form a 3-cycle `X-Y-Z-X` by adding three edges `(X,Y), (Y,Z), (Z,X)`.\nThis requires at least 3 distinct vertices. The problem statement implies we can use existing vertices, and if necessary, implicitly allows adding new vertices if `n < 3` to form a cycle. The example `3 0` yielding `3 1` suggests we should always be able to form a 3-cycle.\n\n- **Option A: Use three existing isolated vertices.**\n    - If `N_edge_comp = 0` and `N_iso >= 3`:\n        - We pick three distinct isolated vertices `X, Y, Z`.\n        - Add edges `(X,Y), (Y,Z), (Z,X)`.\n        - Number of ways: `N_iso * (N_iso - 1) * (N_iso - 2) / 6`.\n        - `t = 3`, `w = N_iso * (N_iso - 1) * (N_iso - 2) / 6`.\n        - Print `3 w` and terminate.\n\n- **Option B: Use existing vertices and one new vertex.**\n    - If `N_edge_comp = 0` and `N_iso = 2` (e.g., vertices 1, 2 exist):\n        - Add a new vertex `X`. Add edges `(1,X), (2,X), (1,2)`.\n        - `t = 3`, `w = 1`.\n        - Print `3 1` and terminate.\n    - If `N_edge_comp = 0` and `N_iso = 1` (e.g., vertex 1 exists):\n        - Add two new vertices `X, Y`. Add edges `(1,X), (X,Y), (Y,1)`.\n        - `t = 3`, `w = 1`.\n        - Print `3 1` and terminate.\n    - If `N_edge_comp = 1` and `N_iso = 0` (e.g., edge 1-2 exists):\n        - Add a new vertex `X`. Add edges `(1,X), (2,X)`. The edge `(1,2)` already exists. This forms `1-X-2-1`.\n        - `t = 2`, `w = 1`. (This case should have been covered by Case 2.2, Option A if we consider new vertices as isolated vertices. But the problem implies adding edges between existing vertices unless explicitly needed. If new vertices are allowed, then `t=2` is always possible if `N_edge_comp >= 1` by adding one new vertex and connecting it to the endpoints of an edge component. The problem implies using existing vertices first.)\n\nLet's re-evaluate `t=3` given the example `3 0` output `3 1`. This implies we can always form a 3-cycle if we have `n >= 1` vertices, by adding new vertices if needed.\nThe minimal number of vertices for an odd cycle is 3.\nIf `n >= 3` and all vertices are isolated (`m=0`), we can pick 3 vertices and connect them. `t=3`.\nIf `n = 2` and `m=0`, we need 1 new vertex. `t=3`.\nIf `n = 1` and `m=0`, we need 2 new vertices. `t=3`.\nIn all these `m=0` scenarios, `w=1` for forming a 3-cycle.\n\nSo, if none of the above `t=0, t=1, t=2` conditions are met, it implies:\n- All components are isolated vertices AND `N_iso < 3` (`N_edge_comp = 0`).\n- All components are single edges AND `N_edge_comp = 1` (`N_iso = 0`).\nIn these cases, `t=3` and `w=1`. We always form a 3-cycle by adding new vertices if necessary.\n\n**Summary of algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    - `adj`: Adjacency list for the graph.\n    - `color`: Array to store 2-coloring (-1 for uncolored).\n    - `visited`: Array to track visited vertices.\n    - `components_data`: List to store `(|A_C|, |B_C|)` for each component.\n\n2.  **BFS/DFS for 2-coloring and component analysis**:\n    - For `u` from 1 to `n`:\n        - If `u` is not visited:\n            - Initialize `count_A = 0`, `count_B = 0`.\n            - `q = deque([(u, 0)])` (vertex, color).\n            - `visited[u] = True`, `color[u] = 0`.\n            - `count_A = 1`.\n            - `is_bipartite_comp = True`.\n            - While `q` is not empty:\n                - `curr_v, curr_color = q.popleft()`.\n                - For `neighbor_v` in `adj[curr_v]`:\n                    - If `neighbor_v` is not visited:\n                        - `visited[neighbor_v] = True`.\n                        - `color[neighbor_v] = 1 - curr_color`.\n                        - If `color[neighbor_v] == 0`: `count_A += 1`.\n                        - Else: `count_B += 1`.\n                        - `q.append((neighbor_v, color[neighbor_v]))`.\n                    - Else if `color[neighbor_v] == curr_color`:\n                        - `is_bipartite_comp = False`.\n                        - Break (odd cycle found).\n                - If not `is_bipartite_comp`: Break.\n            - If not `is_bipartite_comp`:\n                - Print `0 1`.

(This check `adj[u]` can be simplified. If `count_A=1, count_B=1` for a component of size 2, it must be an edge. If `count_A=2, count_B=0` for a component of size 2, it means two isolated vertices, which contradicts connected component definition unless `m=0` and `n=2` and these are two separate components.)\n        - `w_t1 += count_A * (count_A - 1) // 2`.\n        - `w_t1 += count_B * (count_B - 1) // 2`.\n\n    - If `w_t1 > 0`:\n        - Print `1 w_t1`.\n    - Else if `N_iso >= 1` and `N_edge_comp >= 1`:\n        - Print `2 {N_iso * N_edge_comp}`.\n    - Else if `N_edge_comp >= 2`:\n        - Print `2 {2 * N_edge_comp * (N_edge_comp - 1)}`.\n    - Else if `N_iso >= 3`:\n        - Print `3 {N_iso * (N_iso - 1) * (N_iso - 2) // 6}`.\n    - Else: (This covers `N_iso < 3` and `N_edge_comp <= 1`. This means all components are isolated vertices or single edges, but not enough to form a `t=2` or `t=3` cycle among existing vertices.)\n        - Print `3 1`.\n\nThe condition `count_A + count_B == 2` and `adj[u]` has one edge is simplified. If `count_A + count_B == 2`, it means the component has 2 vertices. If it's bipartite, it must be an edge. If it's 2 isolated vertices, they would be two separate components each of size 1. So `N_edge_comp` is simply the count of components where `count_A=1` and `count_B=1`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    color = [-1] * (n + 1) # -1: uncolored, 0: color A, 1: color B\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    components_data = [] # Stores (count_A, count_B) for each bipartite component\n\n    # Step 1: Check for existing odd cycles (t=0) and gather component data\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            q = deque()\n            q.append((i, 0)) # (vertex, color)\n            visited[i] = True\n            color[i] = 0\n            \n            current_comp_count_A = 0\n            current_comp_count_B = 0\n            \n            is_bipartite_comp = True\n            \n            comp_nodes = [] # Collect nodes in current component for later analysis\n            comp_nodes.append(i)\n\n            head = 0\n            while head < len(q):\n                curr_v, curr_c = q[head]\n                head += 1\n                \n                if curr_c == 0:\n                    current_comp_count_A += 1\n                else:\n                    current_comp_count_B += 1\n\n                for neighbor_v in adj[curr_v]:\n                    if not visited[neighbor_v]:\n                        visited[neighbor_v] = True\n                        color[neighbor_v] = 1 - curr_c\n                        q.append((neighbor_v, color[neighbor_v]))\n                        comp_nodes.append(neighbor_v)\n                    elif color[neighbor_v] == curr_c:\n                        # Found an odd cycle\n                        print(\"0 1\")\n                        return\n            \n            # After BFS/DFS for a component, if it's bipartite, store its partition sizes\n            components_data.append((current_comp_count_A, current_comp_count_B))\n\n    # Step 2: Graph is bipartite.
