The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Gilded Cells Calculation - My Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many gilded cells are on a rectangular plate with some rings.  The user wants a Python script to do this. I'm given the plate's dimensions (width 'w' and height 'h'), and the number of gilded rings 'k'.  Let's make sure 'w' represents columns and 'h' represents rows to keep things consistent.\n\nThe first gilded ring is the plate's border, the second ring is two cells *inside* the border, and so on. In other words, each ring \"shrinks\" the inner rectangle by 2 cells on each side (top, bottom, left, right) compared to the previous one.  The problem states that each ring's dimensions are given by  `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  That '4' factor is key; it's `2 * 2`, accounting for the 2 cells lost per side.\n\nSo, for any ring 'i', I can calculate its inner rectangle's dimensions. Then, I can figure out the number of cells in that ring. Remember that perimeter = `2 * width + 2 * height - 4` to avoid counting corners twice.  That formula is only valid if both dimensions are at least 1, but luckily the constraint on 'k' guarantees the inner rectangles always have dimensions of at least 3x3 for any value of 'k'.  That formula is good to go.\n\nThe critical constraint on *k* is: `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`.  That constraint ensures our calculated inner dimensions are always non-negative. It means that after k rings, the plate doesn't shrink to nothing.  Let me trace this - if we had `w=7` and `h=9`, the limit for rings `k` becomes `floor((7 + 1) / 4) = 2`.  If `k` is beyond the limit, it's invalid.\n\nFor each ring, I need to compute the inner rectangle's dimensions, calculate its perimeter, and add that number to the total gilded cell count. I'll need a loop from `i = 1` to `k`.  I'll initialize `total_gilded_cells = 0` before the loop. The code will simply read `w`, `h`, and `k` from input, run the loop, and print the total at the end. I should strip the input line and split it so that it is handled correctly. Let's see - using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` and then `line.split()` makes this easy. After splitting, I need to cast them to integers.\n\nThe algorithm is pretty straightforward: Read input, calculate each ring's cells, accumulate the total. The computations within each iteration are simple arithmetic, so this will be quite fast. Let's test it out with some example calculations to be sure. I can probably run this code as-is; I have covered all the cases. I'm ready to code.\n",
