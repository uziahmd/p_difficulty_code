Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**X-Shape Grid Checker - My Plan**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to check if an `n x n` grid of characters forms an \"X\".  I've got the rules clear in my head, and I'm ready to dive into the implementation.  Let's break this down logically.\n\nFirst, I need to read the grid size, `n`, from the input. I know `n` will be an odd number between 3 and 299, so no need to worry about those edge cases.  Then, I'll read the grid itself, which I'll store as a list of strings, `paper`. That'll be efficient and easy to work with.\n\nNow, the core logic: I'll start by grabbing the characters from the diagonals. The rules state all diagonal elements *must* be the same.  I'll grab the first diagonal character, let's call it `diag_char`, from `paper[0][0]`. Similarly, I'll grab the character from the first non-diagonal element (e.g., `paper[0][1]`) and call that `other_char`. Crucially, `diag_char` and `other_char` *must* be different for it to even be a valid 'X'. If they're the same, I can immediately return \"NO\".\n\nNext, I'll iterate through the entire grid, checking each element.  For each cell, `(row, col)`, I'll determine if it's on a diagonal using `row == col` or `row == n - 1 - col`. If it *is* on a diagonal, I'll make sure it's equal to `diag_char`.  If it's *not* on a diagonal, I'll confirm that it's equal to `other_char`.\n\nIf, at any point during this iteration, I find a mismatch (a diagonal character that isn't `diag_char` or a non-diagonal character that isn't `other_char`), I'll immediately return \"NO\".  If I make it through the entire grid without finding any mismatches, then the grid is indeed an \"X\", and I'll return \"YES\".\n\nGiven `n` being odd, the center cell being on both diagonals simplifies the logic, so I can just apply the general rules. I've considered the `3 <= n < 300` constraint and the structure of a few example grids in my mind. The code should be pretty straightforward, and this methodical approach will make debugging easy, too. Let's get to it!\n",
