Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Colored Boots\" problem.  The goal is to pair up left and right boots based on color compatibility, maximizing the number of pairs.  It's a classic matching problem, and I'm thinking a greedy approach will be the most effective way to solve this, given the constraints.  We've got '?' characters which add some flexibility, but we need to use them intelligently.\n\nThe core of the strategy is to prioritize the matches. I'm going to categorize the boots into two groups: those with specific colors (a-z) and those with the wildcard '?'. The compatibility rules are straightforward: exact color matches are ideal. A '?' can match any specific color or another '?'.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking to proceed: First, I'll identify and match all the pairs where the left and right boots have the same specific color. These are the most restrictive matches. I want to lock those in first, since any remaining boots with a specific color are going to be less useful than any of the '?' boots for later potential matches. It just makes more sense to preserve those for later possible use. I'll need to use some data structures to do this efficiently, probably some dictionaries to keep track of the indices of the boots.  I'll use `left_boots[char]` and `right_boots[char]` where each stores the list of indices for that color.\nAfter all specific color matches have been made, then I can move on to pairing specific color boots with those of color '?'.  I'll just try to make as many matches as possible and record the pairings.  This will involve going through any un-paired specific color boots and seeing if there are any available '?'.\n\nFinally, any remaining '?' boots can be paired up with each other. It doesn't really matter which one I pair them with at this point because they are all the same.",
