Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so the Array Stabilization problem. We're given an array of integers, and \"instability\" is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The task is to remove *one* element and minimize this instability in the resulting array. Constraints: array size is from 2 to 10^5, and elements are between 1 and 10^5. First instinct: sort the array. This gets the minimum and maximum elements readily available, and makes it easier to reason about the effects of removal.\n\n**Key Insight: Minimizing Instability**\n\nTo minimize the instability, the goal is to make the maximum as small as possible and the minimum as large as possible. If we remove a number that is not the smallest or the largest, the overall instability would still be the range of remaining numbers, which would include either the smallest or the largest. So, the key is this - we've got to remove either the smallest or the largest element. After sorting, this becomes obvious: the smallest element is at index 0, largest at index (n-1).\n\n**Algorithm Design and Edge Cases:**\n\nWe'll sort the array. Then, there are two scenarios to consider. Case 1: Remove the smallest element. The new minimum becomes the second smallest. The maximum remains the same. Case 2: Remove the largest element. The minimum stays the same. The maximum becomes the second largest.  We compute instability for each of those cases and take the minimum of those two. No need to look at other cases.\n\nThere is the edge case: `n = 2`. The code handles this edge case correctly, as we would remove one element leaving only the other one.  If all elements are the same, the instability is zero (minimum possible) and is also covered.\n\n**Implementation and Code Structure:**\n\nThe core of the program is sorting, and calculating and comparing the instability from the two cases.  This leads to a time complexity of O(n log n) because of the sort. Space complexity is O(n). Standard input is expected. Let's use `sys.stdin.readline()` for fast input.\n\n**Final Thoughts and Code Review:**\n\nNow to write the code.  Test with a few examples and edge cases for good measure. Let's make sure our indices are right. The solution looks solid and addresses all the requirements. The code is ready.\n",
