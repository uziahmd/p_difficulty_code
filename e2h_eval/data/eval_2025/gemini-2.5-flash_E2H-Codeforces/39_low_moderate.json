Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to construct an N x N board filled with numbers from 1 to N^2. The challenge is to arrange these numbers so that a rook pays strictly fewer \"vuns\" (teleportation fees) than a queen when traversing the board according to the given rules. If no such arrangement is possible, I need to output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to clearly understand the rules. A piece starts at the cell containing 1. In each step, it tries to move to the unvisited cell with the smallest number it can reach in one move. If it can't reach any unvisited cell, it teleports to the unvisited cell with the smallest number and pays a vun.\n\nThe key here is the difference in movement between a rook (horizontal/vertical) and a queen (horizontal/vertical/diagonal). Intuitively, the queen should have an advantage because it has more movement options. It can always reach at least as many cells as a rook from any given position. This means the set of cells reachable by the rook is always a subset of those reachable by the queen.\n\nMathematically, if `S_rook(k)` represents the set of cells reachable by a rook from cell with number `k`, and `S_queen(k)` represents the same for the queen, then `S_rook(k)` is a subset of `S_queen(k)`.\n\nDuring the traversal, the piece looks for the smallest unvisited number it can reach. If it can't find it within its reach, it teleports. Since the queen has more options, it's generally more likely to find a small unvisited number without having to teleport. Thus, it seems like the queen will generally pay fewer or the same number of vuns as the rook. Therefore, the target scenario where the rook pays fewer vuns seems counter-intuitive.\n\nLet's test this with small cases. For N = 1, the board is simply [1]. Both rook and queen visit all cells, leading to zero vuns for both. This satisfies neither the \"rook_vuns < queen_vuns\" requirement, hence I conclude N=1 is invalid.\nLet's continue this small case analysis to see if I can get some helpful insights... maybe a pattern will emerge...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to construct an $N \\times N$ board with numbers from $1$ to $N^2$ such that a rook pays strictly fewer vuns (teleportation fees) than a queen. If no such board exists, we should print -1.\n\nLet's analyze the movement rules and vun payment:\n1. The process starts at the cell containing number 1, which is marked visited.\n2. In each step, the piece at its current position looks for unvisited cells it can reach in one move.\n3. If there are such cells, it moves to the one with the minimal number.\n4. If all reachable cells are already visited AND there are still unvisited cells on the board, the piece teleports to the unvisited cell with the minimal number, pays 1 vun, and marks it visited.\n5. The process stops when all cells are visited.\n\nThe key observation is that a queen can always reach at least as many cells as a rook from any given position (rook moves are a subset of queen moves). This usually means the queen has more options to find a small unvisited number and avoid teleportation, leading to `queen_vuns <= rook_vuns`. We need to find a scenario where `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`.\n\nThis implies we need to design the board such that:\n- When the rook needs to move, it often finds a small unvisited number within its reach.\n- When the queen needs to move, it often finds all its reachable cells already visited, forcing it to teleport to a larger unvisited number. This is counter-intuitive because the queen has more reach.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the board. A simple strategy is to fill numbers in a way that creates a specific pattern.\nConsider placing small numbers (e.g., $1, 2, \\dots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$) in one half of the board and large numbers (e.g., $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\dots, N^2$) in the other half. This might separate the available options for the pieces.\n\nA promising approach is to fill the board by alternating small and large numbers.\nLet's divide the $N \\times N$ board into two halves. For example, the top half (rows $0$ to $N/2-1$) and the bottom half (rows $N/2$ to $N-1$).\nWe can fill the cells in a specific order:\n1. Fill all cells in the top half of the board with numbers $1, 2, \\dots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$.\n2. Fill all cells in the bottom half of the board with numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\dots, N^2$.\n\nTo make the rook pay less, we want the rook to move mostly within one half using small numbers, and then teleport only when necessary. The queen, having more reach, might \"jump\" between halves more easily, using up small numbers in one half and then being forced to teleport to a large number in the other half.\n\nLet's try a specific filling pattern:\nFill the cells $(i, j)$ where $(i+j)$ is even with small numbers, and cells where $(i+j)$ is odd with large numbers. This is a checkerboard pattern.\nOr, perhaps simpler:\nFill the first half of the cells (e.g., top-left $N \\times (N/2)$ block, or $N/2 \\times N$ block) with small numbers, and the remaining cells with large numbers.\n\nLet's try filling the board by alternating numbers from the first half of the sequence ($1, \\dots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$) and the second half of the sequence ($\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\dots, N^2$).\nSpecifically, we can fill cells $(i, j)$ in row-major order:\n- If $(i, j)$ is one of the first $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ cells in row-major order, assign it a number from $1, \\dots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$.\n- Otherwise, assign it a number from $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\dots, N^2$.\n\nThis is still too general. Let's consider the example for $N=4$:\nOutput:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nLet's analyze this specific $N=4$ example.\nNumbers $1, \\dots, 8$ are \"small\" and $9, \\dots, 16$ are \"large\".\nSmall numbers: 4, 3, 6, 7, 5, 1, 8, 2\nLarge numbers: 12, 9, 15, 14, 11, 10, 13, 16\n\nNotice the number 1 is at $(2, 1)$ (0-indexed).\nThe pattern seems to be:\nFill the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i < N/2$ or $i \\ge N/2$ in an alternating fashion.\nLet's try to fill the cells $(i, j)$ where $i < N/2$ with numbers from the first half of $1 \\dots N^2$, and cells where $i \\ge N/2$ with numbers from the second half.\nThis means rows $0 \\dots N/2-1$ get numbers $1 \\dots N \\cdot (N/2)$, and rows $N/2 \\dots N-1$ get numbers $N \\cdot (N/2)+1 \\dots N^2$.\nThis is not what the example does. The example places 1 in the bottom half.\n\nA more effective strategy for creating a difference in vuns is to make the \"small\" numbers accessible to the rook but not necessarily to the queen, or vice-versa.\nConsider placing numbers $1, \\dots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ in a \"checkerboard\" pattern, but not based on parity of coordinates.\nInstead, let's divide the $N \\times N$ grid into two sets of cells.\nSet A: cells $(i, j)$ where $i < N/2$.\nSet B: cells $(i, j)$ where $i \\ge N/2$.\n\nLet's try to fill Set A with numbers from $1$ to $N^2/2$ (or $\\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor$ if $N^2$ is odd).\nAnd Set B with numbers from $N^2/2+1$ to $N^2$.\nThis strategy might work:\n- Fill the first $N/2$ rows with numbers from $1$ to $N \\cdot (N/2)$.\n- Fill the remaining $N/2$ rows with numbers from $N \\cdot (N/2)+1$ to $N^2$.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N \\cdot (N/2)$ are \"small\". The numbers $N \\cdot (N/2)+1, \\dots, N^2$ are \"large\".\nThis means all small numbers are in the top half, and all large numbers are in the bottom half.\nLet's place number 1 in the top half, say at $(0,0)$.\nRook: Stays in the top half, consuming small numbers. When all small numbers are consumed, it will eventually have to teleport to a large number in the bottom half. This means one vun.\nQueen: Starts at $(0,0)$. It can move diagonally. It can potentially move from a cell in the top half to a cell in the bottom half (e.g., from $(N/2-1, c)$ to $(N/2, c+1)$). If it does this and finds a small number there, great. But if it does this and finds a large number there, it might consume all small numbers in the top half, then be forced to teleport to a large number in the bottom half.\n\nWhat if we put small numbers in the top half and large numbers in the bottom half, but then swap one pair of numbers?\nFor example, the smallest number in the bottom half and the largest number in the top half. This is getting complicated.\n\nLet's re-examine the $N=4$ example output:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nThe small numbers ($1 \\dots 8$) are: 4, 3, 6, 7, 5, 1, 8, 2.\nThe large numbers ($9 \\dots 16$) are: 12, 9, 15, 14, 11, 10, 13, 16.\n\nNotice that numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are roughly half of the board.\nLet's try to fill the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i < N/2$ OR $j < N/2$ with small numbers.\nAnd cells $(i, j)$ such that $i \\ge N/2$ AND $j \\ge N/2$ with large numbers.\nThis creates an L-shaped region for small numbers and a square region for large numbers.\n\nThe example $N=4$ output actually has a simpler structure:\nIt fills the cells $(i, j)$ with $i < N/2$ and $j < N/2$ (top-left $N/2 \\times N/2$ block) with some numbers.\nIt fills the cells $(i, j)$ with $i < N/2$ and $j \\ge N/2$ (top-right $N/2 \\times N/2$ block) with some numbers.\nAnd so on for the four quadrants.\n\nLet's try this pattern:\nFill the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i < N/2$ (top $N/2$ rows) with numbers from $1$ to $N^2/2$ (small numbers).\nFill the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i \\ge N/2$ (bottom $N/2$ rows) with numbers from $N^2/2+1$ to $N^2$ (large numbers).\nThis is the simple split. Let's refine it.\nTo make the rook pay less, we want the rook to collect all small numbers in the top half, then teleport once to the smallest number in the bottom half. Total 1 vun.\nTo make the queen pay more, we want the queen to collect some small numbers, then jump to the bottom half (which it can do diagonally), collect some large numbers, then teleport back to the top half for remaining small numbers, and then teleport again to the bottom half for remaining large numbers. This could incur multiple vuns.\n\nConsider filling the top $N/2$ rows with $N^2/2$ values:\nFor $i$ from $0$ to $N/2-1$:\n  For $j$ from $0$ to $N-1$:\n    Assign numbers from $1$ to $N^2/2$ in increasing order.\nThen fill the bottom $N/2$ rows with $N^2/2$ values:\nFor $i$ from $N/2$ to $N-1$:\n  For $j$ from $0$ to $N-1$:\n    Assign numbers from $N^2/2+1$ to $N^2$ in increasing order.\n\nLet's trace this for $N=4$. $N/2=2$. $N^2/2 = 8$.\nRows 0, 1 get numbers 1-8. Rows 2, 3 get numbers 9-16.\nBoard:\n1  2  3  4\n5  6  7  8\n9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16\n\nRook:\nStarts at (0,0) (number 1).\nFrom (0,0), can reach 2, 5. Smallest is 2. Path: 1 -> 2.\nFrom (0,1) (number 2), can reach 1 (visited), 3, 6. Smallest unvisited is 3. Path: 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n...\nRook will traverse numbers 1 through 8 in some order, staying in the top two rows.\nExample path: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5. All numbers 1-8 are visited.\nCurrent position: (1,0) (number 5).\nReachable: (0,0) (1, visited), (1,1) (6, visited), (2,0) (9, unvisited).\nSmallest unvisited reachable is 9.\nSo, rook moves 1 -> ... -> 8 -> 9. (No vun yet).\n... it will continue to traverse 9-16. It will visit all cells without paying any vun, because it can always reach the next smallest number.\nThis board results in 0 vuns for both rook and queen. Not useful.\n\nThe key must be to make the \"next smallest\" number *unreachable* for the queen, but *reachable* for the rook. This is impossible since rook's reachable set is a subset of queen's.\nSo, the alternative: make the \"next smallest\" number unreachable for *both*, so they both teleport. But then the queen should teleport to a *larger* number.\n\nThis implies that the queen should use its diagonal moves to its disadvantage.\nConsider the $N=4$ example again:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nNumbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are $1, \\dots, 8$.\nNumbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are $9, \\dots, 16$.\n\nThe sample output fills the board by placing numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in the cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even, and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is odd.\nNo, that's not it either. For $N=4$, $N^2/2 = 8$.\nEven sum cells: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)\nOdd sum cells: (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)\n\nLet's count how many small numbers are on even sum cells and odd sum cells in the example.\nSmall numbers ($1 \\dots 8$):\n1 at (2,1) (sum 3, odd)\n2 at (3,3) (sum 6, even)\n3 at (0,1) (sum 1, odd)\n4 at (0,0) (sum 0, even)\n5 at (1,1) (sum 2, even)\n6 at (0,2) (sum 2, even)\n7 at (1,0) (sum 1, odd)\n8 at (3,1) (sum 4, even)\nTotal 5 small numbers on even sum cells, 3 small numbers on odd sum cells. Not a clean split.\n\nLet's try a different approach.\nWhat if we place the numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants, and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in the top-right and bottom-left quadrants?\nThis is essentially a \"checkerboard of quadrants\" pattern.\nFor $N=4$:\nTop-left (rows 0-1, cols 0-1) and Bottom-right (rows 2-3, cols 2-3) get small numbers.\nTop-right (rows 0-1, cols 2-3) and Bottom-left (rows 2-3, cols 0-1) get large numbers.\nExample $N=4$. $N/2=2$.\nSmall numbers: $1 \\dots 8$.

Smallest is 9.\nQueen teleports to (0,2) (number 9). Pays 1 vun.\n... Queen will visit all remaining numbers 9-16.\nTotal vuns for Queen: 2.\n\nIn this strategy, both rook and queen pay 2 vuns. This doesn't satisfy `rook_vuns < queen_vuns`.\n\nThe example output for $N=4$ has rook vuns = 1, queen vuns = 2.\nLet's analyze the example's strategy:\nBoard:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nSmall numbers ($1 \\dots 8$): 4, 3, 6, 7, 5, 1, 8, 2.\nLarge numbers ($9 \\dots 16$): 12, 9, 15, 14, 11, 10, 13, 16.\n\nThe small numbers are somewhat scattered.\nThe key insight might be related to the number of cells.\nIf $N=1$, output -1.\nIf $N=2$, $N^2=4$. $N^2/2=2$.\nSmall numbers $1,2$. Large numbers $3,4$.\nIf we put $1,2$ in two cells, and $3,4$ in the other two.\nSay:\n1 3\n2 4\nRook: 1 -> 2. From (1,0) (2), reachable (0,0) (1,V), (1,1) (4,U). Smallest U is 4. Path 1 -> 2 -> 4. From (1,1) (4), reachable (0,1) (3,U). Smallest U is 3. Path 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3. No vuns.\nQueen: Same path. No vuns.\n\nThis problem is tricky because we need to specifically engineer a scenario where the queen's *additional* moves become a disadvantage. This happens if the queen uses its diagonal moves to reach cells that contain numbers that are *not* the minimum unvisited number, and by doing so, it \"consumes\" its available moves or blocks itself from reaching the true minimum.\n\nThe example solution for $N=4$ has a specific structure.\nLet's denote $M = N^2$.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, M/2$ (let's call them \"small\") and $M/2+1, \\dots, M$ (let's call them \"large\").\nThe strategy from the example seems to be:\nPlace small numbers in cells $(i, j)$ such that $i < N/2$ and $j < N/2$ (top-left quadrant) AND cells $(i, j)$ such that $i \\ge N/2$ and $j \\ge N/2$ (bottom-right quadrant).\nPlace large numbers in cells $(i, j)$ such that $i < N/2$ and $j \\ge N/2$ (top-right quadrant) AND cells $(i, j)$ such that $i \\ge N/2$ and $j < N/2$ (bottom-left quadrant).\n\nThis is exactly the checkerboard-of-quadrants strategy I tried above, which resulted in 2 vuns for both.\nThe actual numbers in the $N=4$ example are not this clean split.\nFor example, 1 is in bottom-left quadrant (large region in my strategy). 2 is in bottom-right (small region). 3 is in top-right (large region). 4 is in top-left (small region). This is very mixed.\n\nWhat if we put all numbers $1, \\dots, N^2$ in some specific order?\nLet's try to put numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in a specific pattern, and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in another.\nConsider the solution for $N=4$ again.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, 8$ are (in order of appearance in the board): 4, 3, 6, 7, 5, 1, 8, 2.\nThe cells for these are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,3).\nThe numbers $9, \\dots, 16$ are: 12, 9, 15, 14, 11, 10, 13, 16.\nThe cells for these are: (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2).\n\nThe key for the example $N=4$ is that the numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are placed in a way that:\n- Rook can \"sweep\" through them, mostly staying within its reach.\n- Queen, with its diagonal moves, might skip over some small numbers, or visit cells with large numbers prematurely.\n\nLet's try to construct a general solution based on the pattern of the $N=4$ example.\nThe example $N=4$ places $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ (small) and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ (large).\nIt places small numbers in cells $(i, j)$ where $i < N/2$ and $j < N/2$ or $i \\ge N/2$ and $j \\ge N/2$.\nAnd large numbers in cells $(i, j)$ where $i < N/2$ and $j \\ge N/2$ or $i \\ge N/2$ and $j < N/2$.\nThis is the pattern that gave 2 vuns for both.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is NOT this pattern.\nThe number 1 is at (2,1). This is in the bottom-left quadrant.\nNumber 2 is at (3,3). This is in the bottom-right quadrant.\nNumber 3 is at (0,1). This is in the top-left quadrant.\nNumber 4 is at (0,0). This is in the top-left quadrant.\n\nThe example's pattern is:\nFill the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i < N/2$ with numbers from $1$ to $N^2/2$.\nFill the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i \\ge N/2$ with numbers from $N^2/2+1$ to $N^2$.\nThis is the simple top-half/bottom-half split.\nBut then, it seems to swap some values to make it work.\n\nLet $N_{small} = \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ and $N_{large} = N^2 - N_{small}$.\nLet's fill the board:\nNumbers $1, \\dots, N_{small}$ are placed in the first $N_{small}$ cells in row-major order.\nNumbers $N_{small}+1, \\dots, N^2$ are placed in the remaining $N_{large}$ cells in row-major order.\nThis is the \"naive\" filling. This will result in 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe problem asks for $N \\le 500$. $N=1$ is -1.\nThe sample output for $N=4$ is not immediately obvious.\nLet's re-evaluate the condition for $N=1$.\n$N=1$, board is `[[1]]`. Start at 1. All cells visited. Stop. 0 vuns for both. `0 < 0` is false. So $N=1$ is -1. This is correct.\n\nWhat if $N$ is odd and $N > 1$?\nFor $N=3$, $N^2=9$. $N^2/2 = 4.5$. Small numbers $1,2,3,4$. Large numbers $5,6,7,8,9$.\nIf we use the checkerboard of quadrants strategy, it won't work perfectly as $N/2$ is not an integer.\nFor $N=3$, $N/2=1.5$. We can take $N/2$ to be $\\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor = 1$.\nSo, row 0 is \"top half\", rows 1, 2 are \"bottom half\".\nOr cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even get small numbers, and $i+j$ is odd get large numbers.\nThis is a standard checkerboard pattern.\nSmall numbers: $1,2,3,4,5$. Large numbers: $6,7,8,9$.\nBoard:\n1 6 2\n7 3 8\n4 9 5\nStart at (0,0) (1).\nRook:\n1 -> 2 (0,2). From (0,2), reachable (0,0)=1(V), (0,1)=6, (1,2)=8. Smallest unvisited is 6.\nPath: 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4 -> 9 -> 5 -> 8. No vuns.\n\nThis problem is a construction problem. Often, the construction is simple once the insight is found.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is the key. It must be a generalizable pattern.\n\nLet's look at the sample output $N=4$ again:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are $1, \\dots, 8$.\nThe numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are $9, \\dots, 16$.\n\nLet's try to put small numbers in the first half of the available cells (in row-major order) and large numbers in the second half of the available cells.\nBut then, we swap the position of some cells.\nWhat if we place numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i < N/2$ OR $j < N/2$?\nAnd numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i \\ge N/2$ AND $j \\ge N/2$?\nThis creates an L-shaped region for small numbers and a square region for large numbers.\nFor $N=4$:\nSmall region:\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)\n(2,0) (2,1) (3,0) (3,1)\nTotal $2N + 2(N/2) = 2N + N = 3N = 12$ cells.\nThis is not $N^2/2 = 8$ cells.\n\nThe number of cells in the top $N/2$ rows is $N \\cdot (N/2)$.\nThe number of cells in the bottom $N/2$ rows is $N \\cdot (N/2)$.\nTotal $N^2$ cells.\n\nLet's fill the cells $(i,j)$ in the first $N/2$ rows with $N^2/2$ numbers, and the cells $(i,j)$ in the last $N/2$ rows with the remaining $N^2/2$ numbers.\nBut we need to make sure the queen pays more.\nIf we fill the cells $(i,j)$ where $i < N/2$ with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ (top half).\nAnd cells $(i,j)$ where $i \\ge N/2$ with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ (bottom half).\nThen, we need to swap some numbers to make the queen pay more.\nWhat if we swap the cell $(0,0)$ with the cell $(N/2, N/2)$?\nThis means 1 is not at $(0,0)$.\n\nThe given example for $N=4$ is solved by this pattern:\nFill the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i+j$ is even with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in increasing order.\nFill the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i+j$ is odd with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in increasing order.\nLet's test this with $N=4$.\n$N^2=16$.

Total 2 vuns.\n\nThe example's board for $N=4$ works. The pattern is not a simple checkerboard for small/large numbers.\nIt seems like the board is filled in two stages:\n1. Fill cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is even.\n2. Fill cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is odd.\nBut the numbers assigned are not $1 \\dots N^2/2$ for one set and $N^2/2+1 \\dots N^2$ for the other.\nInstead, it seems to be:\n- Fill the cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is even with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ (or $N^2/2$ numbers from $1 \\dots N^2$).\n- Fill the cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is odd with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ (or $N^2/2$ numbers from $1 \\dots N^2$).\nThis is the pattern I tested and it gave 2 vuns for both.\n\nThe actual pattern for $N=4$ example is:\n`small_count = N*N // 2`\n`large_count = N*N - small_count`\n`small_nums = list(range(1, small_count + 1))`\n`large_nums = list(range(small_count + 1, N*N + 1))`\n\nThe board is filled such that:\n`board[i][j]` takes a number from `small_nums` if `i` is even.\n`board[i][j]` takes a number from `large_nums` if `i` is odd.\nThis is a row-wise split.\nNo, the example is not this simple.\nRow 0: 4 3 6 12 (small, small, small, large)\nRow 1: 7 5 9 15 (small, small, large, large)\nRow 2: 14 1 11 10 (large, small, large, large)\nRow 3: 13 8 16 2 (large, small, large, small)\n\nThis is highly irregular.\nMaybe the solution is simply to place $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ in cells $(i, j)$ where $i < N/2$ and $j < N/2$, and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in other cells.\nThis is the quadrant strategy.\nFor $N=4$:\n1  2  9 10\n3  4 11 12\n13 14  5  6\n15 16  7  8\nThis gives 2 vuns for both.\n\nWhat if $N$ is odd?\nFor $N=3$, $N^2=9$. $N^2/2=4$.\nSmall $1,2,3,4$.

Total 2 vuns.\n\nThe key is that for the queen, after visiting 14, 16 is still unvisited and unreachable.\nFor the rook, after visiting 14, all cells are visited.\n\nThis implies that the rook visits 16 *before* 14.\nRook path: ... $8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15$.\nQueen path: ... $8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15$.\nThe queen does not visit 16 at this point.\n\nThis suggests that 16 must be reachable by rook from 8, but not by queen from 8.\nThis is impossible. Queen can reach everything rook can.\nSo, the queen must have options that the rook doesn't, and those options lead to a different path.\n\nThe sample output logic is:\nFill cells $(i,j)$ where $i < N/2$ AND $j < N/2$ (top-left quadrant) with small numbers.\nFill cells $(i,j)$ where $i < N/2$ AND $j \\ge N/2$ (top-right quadrant) with small numbers.\nFill cells $(i,j)$ where $i \\ge N/2$ AND $j < N/2$ (bottom-left quadrant) with large numbers.\nFill cells $(i,j)$ where $i \\ge N/2$ AND $j \\ge N/2$ (bottom-right quadrant) with large numbers.\n\nThis is the \"top half small, bottom half large\" strategy applied to columns.\nNo, it's not.\nIt's more like:\n`small_count = N*N // 2`\n`large_count = N*N - small_count`\n`small_nums = list(range(1, small_count + 1))`\n`large_nums = list(range(small_count + 1, N*N + 1))`\n\nIterate `i` from $0$ to $N-1$:\n  Iterate `j` from $0$ to $N-1$:\n    If `(i < N/2 and j < N/2)` or `(i >= N/2 and j >= N/2)`: // top-left and bottom-right quadrants\n      `board[i][j]` gets a number from `small_nums`.\n    Else: // top-right and bottom-left quadrants\n      `board[i][j]` gets a number from `large_nums`.\n\nThis is the checkerboard-of-quadrants strategy.\nLet's try to make the small numbers available in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants.\nAnd large numbers in the top-right and bottom-left quadrants.\nThis is exactly what I did and it resulted in 2 vuns for both.\nThe sample output for $N=4$ is NOT this pattern.\nThe sample output for $N=4$ is:\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nLet's check the number of small/large numbers in each quadrant:\nTL (0-1, 0-1): 4, 3, 7, 5 (4 small)\nTR (0-1, 2-3): 6, 12, 9, 15 (2 small, 2 large)\nBL (2-3, 0-1): 14, 1, 13, 8 (2 small, 2 large)\nBR (2-3, 2-3): 11, 10, 16, 2 (1 small, 3 large)\n\nThis is not clean. This implies the numbers are placed in a very specific, non-obvious order.\n\nWhat if we fill the board in a specific order:\nFirst, fill the cells $(i, j)$ such that $i < N/2$ and $j < N/2$ (top-left quadrant).\nThen fill $(i, j)$ such that $i \\ge N/2$ and $j \\ge N/2$ (bottom-right quadrant).\nThen fill $(i, j)$ such that $i < N/2$ and $j \\ge N/2$ (top-right quadrant).\nFinally fill $(i, j)$ such that $i \\ge N/2$ and $j < N/2$ (bottom-left quadrant).\n\nThis is a specific order of filling quadrants.\nLet's use a counter `k = 1`.\n1. For $i$ from $0$ to $N/2-1$: for $j$ from $0$ to $N/2-1$: `board[i][j] = k++`\n2. For $i$ from $N/2$ to $N-1$: for $j$ from $N/2$ to $N-1$: `board[i][j] = k++`\n3.

So this is not the sample output.\n\nThe sample output for $N=4$ cannot be generalized by simple quadrant filling.\nIt seems the numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are placed in $N^2/2$ cells, and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ in the rest.\nThe rook and queen have different paths because of the specific placement of numbers.\n\nThe problem is a construction problem, which often means there's a simple pattern.\nIf $N$ is odd, $N^2$ is odd. Then $N^2/2$ is not an integer.\nThe number of cells is $N^2$.\n`small_count = N*N // 2` (e.g. for N=3, small_count=4)\n`large_count = N*N - small_count` (e.g. for N=3, large_count=5)\nThis means one group has one more number than the other.\n\nWhat if we fill the top $N/2$ rows with $N^2 - (N^2/2)$ numbers (i.e., `large_count` numbers)?\nAnd the bottom $N/2$ rows with $N^2/2$ numbers (i.e., `small_count` numbers)?\nThis means small numbers are in the bottom half.\nLet's try this:\n`board = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]`\n`small_val = 1`\n`large_val = N*N // 2 + 1`\n\nFor $i$ from $0$ to $N-1$:\n  For $j$ from $0$ to $N-1$:\n    If $i < N/2$:\n      `board[i][j] = large_val`\n      `large_val += 1`\n    Else:\n      `board[i][j] = small_val`\n      `small_val += 1`\n\nThis puts large numbers in the top half, small numbers in the bottom half.\nExample $N=4$:\n9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16\n1  2  3  4\n5  6  7  8\n\nRook:\nStarts at (2,0) (number 1).\nFrom (2,0): reachable (2,1)=2, (3,0)=5.

This means the queen uses its extra moves to its disadvantage.\n\nThe simplest working solution for $N \\ge 4$ might be:\nFill the first $N/2$ rows with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ and the remaining $N/2$ rows with $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThen, swap all numbers in the first column with numbers in the last column.\nThis is getting too specific.\n\nFinal attempt at a general pattern:\nIf $N \\le 3$, print -1.\nOtherwise ($N \\ge 4$):\nCreate an $N \\times N$ board.\nFill the first $N^2/2$ cells (in row-major order) with numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\nFill the remaining $N^2/2$ cells with numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nThen, swap the value at $(0,0)$ with the value at $(N-1, N-1)$.\nThis will put a large number at $(0,0)$ and a small number at $(N-1, N-1)$.\nThis would force the piece to move from a large number at $(0,0)$ to the smallest reachable number.\n\nLet's use the pattern from a known solution for this problem:\nFor $N \\le 3$, print -1.\nFor $N \\ge 4$:\nFill the board in a specific way:\nIterate $i$ from $0$ to $N-1$, $j$ from $0$ to $N-1$.\nAssign numbers $1, 2, \\dots, N^2$ to the cells.\nThe first $N^2/2$ cells (in row-major order) get numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$.\nThe remaining $N^2/2$ cells get numbers $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nLet's call the resulting board `temp_board`.\nNow, swap the values in `temp_board` based on parity.\nSpecifically, for each cell $(i, j)$:\nIf `(i+j)` is even, `board[i][j]` takes a value from `temp_board` at a specific position.\nIf `(i+j)` is odd, `board[i][j]` takes a value from `temp_board` at another specific position.\n\nThis is still complex.\nA simpler pattern that works is to fill the first $N/2$ rows alternating small and large numbers, and the second $N/2$ rows alternating large and small numbers.\nLet `small_val = 1`, `large_val = N*N // 2 + 1`.\n\nFor $i$ from $0$ to $N-1$:\n  For $j$ from $0$ to $N-1$:\n    If $i < N/2$: // Top half rows\n      If $j % 2 == 0$: // Even columns\n        `board[i][j] = small_val`\n        `small_val += 1`\n      Else: // Odd columns\n        `board[i][j] = large_val`\n        `large_val += 1`\n    Else: // Bottom half rows\n      If $j % 2 == 0$: // Even columns\n        `board[i][j] = large_val`\n        `large_val += 1`\n      Else: // Odd columns\n        `board[i][j] = small_val`\n        `small_val += 1`\n\nLet's test this for $N=4$.\nSmall: $1..8$. Large: $9..16$.\nRow 0 (top, even): S L S L -> 1 9 2 10\nRow 1 (top, odd): S L S L -> 3 11 4 12\nRow 2 (bottom, even): L S L S -> 13 5 14 6\nRow 3 (bottom, odd): L S L S -> 15 7 16 8\n\nBoard:\n1  9  2 10\n3 11  4 12\n13  5 14  6\n15  7 16  8\n\nThis board is different from the previous checkerboard.\nLet's trace this for Rook:\nStart at (0,0) (1).\nFrom (0,0): reachable (0,1)=9, (1,0)=3.
