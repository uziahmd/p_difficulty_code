    "thought": "**Analyzing a Competitive Programming Problem: Counting Valid Set Sequences**\n\nI'm tackling a challenging problem involving sets and their \"child\" relationships, aiming to devise an efficient Python script. The core challenge lies in understanding the constraints and deriving a clear mathematical formulation.\n\nInitially, I meticulously dissected the problem definition, especially the \"child\" relationship, where an element `x` in set `A` requires `x+1` in set `B`. This constraint seems straightforward, but the element bound from `1` to `K` introduces a crucial twist: if a set contains `K`, it cannot be a child (due to the lack of `K+1`). This crucial point will guide how to process the problem.\n\nThis led to realizing that if `A` is a child of `B`, then `A` can't contain the value `K`. So, only the last set in the chain of sets can include `K`, if such is even available.\n\nNow I'm looking into the implication of this constraint, focusing on determining valid set sequences (`S'_1, S'_2, ..., S'_N`). I defined the set of valid set values and the relationship between elements. It boils down to this: for a set `S'_i` to be a \"child\" of `S'_{i+1}`, all elements in `S'_i` must have their successor elements in `S'_{i+1}`. I formalized this as `S'_i + 1 ⊆ S'_{i+1}`. If we are looking for valid sequences we need `S'_i` to contain at most `K-(N-i)` elements, and so on.\n\nThe next step is to count the valid ways the sequence can be arranged. To ensure that elements in `S'_i` are followed by respective successors in later sequences, I represented sets as bitmasks or element lists. This naturally led to a grid-like structure where each element's presence across sets forms a path that progresses from a sequence to another.\n\nTo quantify the valid structure, I expressed the constraints using a grid (i, j) based on whether an element `j` belongs to `S'_i`. The condition `S'_i+1 ⊆ S'_{i+1}` then translates to the constraint that once an element appears in a set (`s_{i,j} = 1`), all successors and subsequent sets must also include the successive elements (`s_{i+k, j+k} = 1`). This is the crux of the problem.\n\nFor an element to be included in a set, if the element is in `S'_i`, the element `j+1` must be in `S'_{i+1}`. This implies for a particular element `j`, if it appears in `S'_i`, it continues in subsequent sets (down and to the right on a grid). Then I formulated this as `S'_{i} \\to S'_{i+1}` implying if element `j` is in `S'_{i}`, then the value `j+1` must appear in the next set `S'_{i+1}`.\n\nThis implies each element creates a path, which can only change from `0` to `1` as `i` increases along the anti-diagonal paths on a 2D grid `S_{j,i}`. I analyzed all possible paths an element can follow across all anti-diagonals, deriving the overall structure which I then attempted to count. I used a grid model, where the value of an element can be calculated by the elements to its left, top and top-left. It is very similar to dynamic programming.\n\nThe structure of the bitmask now becomes very apparent. The constraints mean that we can fill in a table that represents the sets. For all the sets, each element has to follow a path where it can either be present or not. It needs to only transition from absent (`0`) to present (`1`).\n\nBy recognizing this pattern in the grid, I could express the number of valid sequences. The key is in the non-decreasing pattern along anti-diagonals. The total number of valid sets is the product of (`K-d`+1) for some range of `d`s. So, there are `N+1` choices for each anti-diagonal (all zeros, one 1, etc.). There are K anti-diagonals to produce a total answer of (`N+1`)^K.\n\nThe final step involves accounting for permutations of these sequences, a multi-set problem. If all sets are distinct, there are `N!` permutations. If sets are duplicated then there are repetitions to handle when producing a correct answer. I need a final script to use these relationships to solve the problem and efficiently provide the right answer.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of arrays `[S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_N]` of sets, where each set `S_j` contains integers from `1` to `K`, such that there exists a permutation `[S'_1, S'_2, \\ldots, S'_N]` of the original array satisfying the condition: `S'_i` is a child of `S'_{i+1}` for `1 \\le i \\le N-1`. A set `A` is a child of `B` if for every `x \\in A`, `x+1 \\in B`.\n\nLet's analyze the child condition `A+1 \\subseteq B`.\nIf `x \\in A` and `x=K`, then `K+1` must be in `B`. However, all elements in sets are restricted to `1` to `K`. This means `K+1` cannot be in `B`. Therefore, if `A` contains `K`, `A` cannot be a child of any set `B`.\nFor the sequence `S'_1, S'_2, \\ldots, S'_N` to exist, `S'_i` must be a child of `S'_{i+1}` for `1 \\le i \\le N-1`. This implies that `S'_1, S'_2, \\ldots, S'_{N-1}` cannot contain the element `K`. `S'_N` is not required to be a child of any set, so `S'_N` can contain `K`.\n\nMore generally, if `x \\in S'_i`, then `x+1 \\in S'_{i+1}`, `x+2 \\in S'_{i+2}`, ..., `x+(N-i) \\in S'_N`.\nFor this chain of elements to be valid, `x+(N-i)` must be an element that can exist in `S'_N`, i.e., `x+(N-i) \\le K`.\nThis implies that `S'_i` can only contain elements `x` such that `x \\le K-(N-i)`.\nLet `U_i = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, K-(N-i)\\}`. Then `S'_i \\subseteq U_i`.\nNote that `U_N = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, K\\}`. If `K-(N-i) < 1`, then `U_i` is the empty set, meaning `S'_i` must be empty.\n\nLet's represent the presence of element `j` in set `S'_i` by a binary variable `s_{j,i}`. So `s_{j,i}=1` if `j \\in S'_i`, and `s_{j,i}=0` otherwise.\nThe conditions become:\n1. `s_{j,i}=1 \\implies s_{j+1, i+1}=1` for `1 \\le j < K` and `1 \\le i < N`.\n2. `s_{j,i}=0` if `j > K-(N-i)`. (This implies `s_{K,i}=0` for `i < N`).\n\nConsider the \"anti-diagonals\" `j-i = d`.\nCondition 1 implies that along each anti-diagonal `d`, the values `s_{j,i}` must be non-decreasing as `i` increases (and `j` increases). That is, if `s_{j,i}=1`, then for all `p > i` (such that `j+(p-i)` is a valid element index and `p` is a valid set index), `s_{j+(p-i), p}=1`. This means the sequence `(s_{d+1,1}, s_{d+2,2}, \\ldots, s_{d+N,N})` (for values that are in bounds `1 \\le d+k \\le K` and `1 \\le k \\le N`) must be of the form `0, \\ldots, 0, 1, \\ldots, 1`.\nThe number of choices for such a sequence of length `L` is `L+1` (all zeros, one 1, ..., all ones).\n\nThe range for `d=j-i`:\nMinimum `d`: `j=1, i=N \\implies d=1-N`.\nMaximum `d`: `j=K, i=1 \\implies d=K-1`.\nSo `d` ranges from `1-N` to `K-1`.\n\nNow consider condition 2: `s_{j,i}=0` if `j > K-(N-i)`.\nThis can be rewritten as `j-i > K-N`.\nSo, for any `d > K-N`, all `s_{j,i}` with `j-i=d` must be `0`. This means for these `d`, there is only 1 choice (all zeros).\n\nFor `d \\le K-N`:\nThe elements `(j,i)` on this anti-diagonal are `(d+1,1), (d+2,2), \\ldots, (d+N,N)`.\nFor any `(j,i)` on this anti-diagonal, `j-i = d \\le K-N \\implies j \\le K-(N-i)`. So condition 2 doesn't force these `s_{j,i}` to be `0`.\nThe length of this sequence is `N`. (Because `d+N \\le K` is not necessarily true, but `s_{j,i}` has `N` terms, some of which may be out of bounds for `j > K`).\nHowever, the maximum `j` for `s_{j,i}` is `K`. So the sequence is `(s_{d+1,1}, \\ldots, s_{K, K-d})`.\nThe length of this anti-diagonal within the `N \\times K` grid is `min(N, K-d)`.\nFor `d \\le K-N`, we have `K-d \\ge N`. So `min(N, K-d) = N`.\nThus, for `d \\in [1-N, K-N]`, each anti-diagonal has `N` elements, and there are `N+1` ways to choose the `0..01..1` pattern.\nThe number of such `d` values is `(K-N) - (1-N) + 1 = K`.\nSo, the total number of distinct valid sequences `[S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]` is `(N+1)^K`.\n\nEach such sequence `[S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]` consists of `N` sets. The problem asks for the number of different arrays `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` such that their multiset of sets `{S_1, \\ldots, S_N}` can be rearranged into a valid `S'`. This means we need to count the number of multisets `{S_1, \\ldots, S_N}` that can form a valid sequence `S'`.\n\nLet `P(X)` be the property that `X` is a set that can appear in a valid sequence `S'`.\nThe properties of sets `S'_i` are:\n1. `S'_i \\subseteq U_i = \\{1, \\ldots, K-(N-i)\\}`.\n2. `S'_i+1 \\subseteq S'_{i+1}`.\n\nLet `S_i` be a set. Define its \"type\" as `(S_i, i)` if `S_i` is to be placed at position `i` in the sequence `S'`.\nThe specific values `N` and `K` can be up to `2 \\cdot 10^5`. `(N+1)^K` is too large to compute directly.\nThe problem statement implies that we are counting arrays `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` where the *multiset* of sets `{S_1, \\ldots, S_N}` is valid. For example, if `N=2`, `S_1=\\{\\}, S_2=\\{1\\}` is an array. Its multiset is `\\{\\{\\}, \\{1\\}\\}`. This multiset can be rearranged to `S'_1=\\{\\}, S'_2=\\{1\\}` which is valid. The array `[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]` is counted. The array `[\\{1\\}, \\{\\}]` is also counted.\n\nThe example `N=2, K=2` has `(2+1)^2 = 9` valid sequences `S'`.\n`S'_1 \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, 2-(2-1)\\} = \\{1\\}$. `S'_2 \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, 2-(2-2)\\} = \\{1, 2\\}`.\n`S'_1+1 \\subseteq S'_2`.\nPossible `S'_1`: `\\{\\}`, `\\{1\\}`.\nIf `S'_1 = \\{\\}`: `\\{\\}+1 \\subseteq S'_2`, so `\\{\\} \\subseteq S'_2`. `S'_2` can be any subset of `\\{1,2\\}`.\n    `S'_2` can be `\\{\\}`, `\\{1\\}`, `\\{2\\}`, `\\{1,2\\}`. (4 sequences)\n    `[\\{\\}, \\{\\}]`, `[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]`, `[\\{\\}, \\{2\\}]`, `[\\{\\}, \\{1,2\\}]`\nIf `S'_1 = \\{1\\}`: `\\{1\\}+1 \\subseteq S'_2`, so `\\{2\\} \\subseteq S'_2`. `S'_2` must contain `2`.\n    `S'_2` can be `\\{2\\}`, `\\{1,2\\}`. (2 sequences)\n    `[\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}]`, `[\\{1\\}, \\{1,2\\}]`\nTotal valid sequences: `4+2 = 6`. My formula `(N+1)^K = (2+1)^2 = 9` is wrong.\n\nThe `min(N, K-d)` term was simplified to `N` because `K-d \\ge N` was assumed.\n`d \\in [1-N, K-N]`. For `d=K-N`, `K-d = N`. For `d=1-N`, `K-d = K-(1-N) = K+N-1`.\nSo `K-d` ranges from `N` to `K+N-1`. In this range, `min(N, K-d)` is indeed `N`.\nSo the number of valid *sequences* `S'` is `(N+1)^K`.\n\nLet's re-check `N=2, K=2`.\n`d \\in [1-2, 2-1] = [-1, 1]`.\n`d=j-i`.\n`d=-1`: `j-i=-1`. `(1,2)`. `s_{1,2}`. `K-d = 2-(-1) = 3`. `min(N, K-d) = min(2,3) = 2`.\n    Sequence `(s_{1,2})`. Length `1`. `1+1=2` choices. (This is `s_{j,i}` for `i=2, j=1`).\n    `s_{j,i}=0` if `j > K-(N-i)`. `s_{1,2}=0` if `1 > 2-(2-2)=2`. This is false, so `s_{1,2}` can be 0 or 1.\n    `s_{1,2}` can be `0` or `1`.\n`d=0`: `j-i=0`. `(1,1), (2,2)`. `K-d = 2-0 = 2`. `min(N, K-d) = min(2,2) = 2`.\n    Sequence `(s_{1,1}, s_{2,2})`. Length `2`. `2+1=3` choices: `(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)`.\n    `s_{1,1}=0` if `1 > K-(N-1) = 2-(2-1)=1`. False.\n    `s_{2,2}=0` if `2 > K-(N-2) = 2-(2-2)=2`. False.\n    So `s_{1,1}, s_{2,2}` can be `(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)`.\n`d=1`: `j-i=1`. `(2,1)`. `K-d = 2-1 = 1`. `min(N, K-d) = min(2,1) = 1`.\n    Sequence `(s_{2,1})`. Length `1`. `1+1=2` choices.\n    `s_{2,1}=0` if `2 > K-(N-1) = 2-(2-1)=1`. This is true. So `s_{2,1}` must be `0`.\n    So for `d=1`, only 1 choice (all 0s).\n\nTotal choices: `2 * 3 * 1 = 6`. This matches the example.\nSo the number of valid *sequences* `S'` is indeed `\\prod_{d=1-N}^{K-1} (min(N, K-d)+1)` where for `d > K-N`, `min(N, K-d)` becomes `0` (or 1 choice for `0...0` pattern).\nMore precisely, `\\prod_{d=1-N}^{K-1} (\\max(0, \\min(N, K-d))+1)` if we define `min(N,0)=0`.\nThe number of elements on anti-diagonal `d` is `L_d = \\max(0, \\min(N, K-d))`. The number of choices is `L_d+1`.\nThe product is `\\prod_{d=1-N}^{K-1} (\\max(0, \\min(N, K-d)) + 1)`.\nLet `L_d = \\min(N, K-d)`.\nIf `d > K-N`, then `K-d < N`. In this case `L_d = K-d`.\nIf `d \\le K-N`, then `K-d \\ge N`. In this case `L_d = N`.\nSo the product is `(N+1)^K \\times \\prod_{d=K-N+1}^{K-1} (K-d+1)`. (This is for `K-N \\ge 1-N`, i.e., `K \\ge 1`).\nThe product `\\prod_{d=K-N+1}^{K-1} (K-d+1)` can be rewritten by letting `j=K-d+1`.\nWhen `d=K-N+1`, `j = K-(K-N+1)+1 = N`.\nWhen `d=K-1`, `j = K-(K-1)+1 = 2`.\nSo the product is `\\prod_{j=2}^{N} j = N!`.\nThus, the total number of valid sequences `S'` is `(N+1)^K \\times N!`. This is still incorrect for `N=2, K=2`.\n`N=2, K=2`: `(2+1)^2 \\times 2! = 9 \\times 2 = 18`. My calculation above gave `6`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `L_d = \\min(N, K-d)`.\nThe indices for `s_{j,i}` are `i \\in [1,N]` and `j \\in [1,K]`.\nThe condition `s_{j,i}=0` if `j > K-(N-i)` is equivalent to `s_{j,i}=0` if `j+N-i > K`.\nThis means `s_{j,i}=0` if `j-i > K-N`.\nSo for `d > K-N`, all `s_{j,i}` where `j-i=d` must be `0`.\nThe range of `d` for which there are choices is `d \\in [1-N, K-N]`.\nFor `d` in this range, `K-d \\ge N`. So `L_d = \\min(N, K-d) = N`.\nThe number of such `d` values is `(K-N) - (1-N) + 1 = K`.\nSo there are `K` anti-diagonals, each with `N+1` choices.\nThis gives `(N+1)^K` total valid sequences `S'`.\n\nLet's trace `N=2, K=2` again.\n`d \\in [-1, 0, 1]`.\n`K-N = 2-2 = 0`.\n`d \\le K-N`: `d=-1, 0`.\n    `d=-1`: `L_{-1} = \\min(2, 2-(-1)) = \\min(2,3) = 2`. Choices: `2+1=3`.\n        The sequence is `(s_{d+1,1}, s_{d+2,2}) = (s_{0,1}, s_{1,2})`. But `j` must be `\\ge 1`.\n        So the sequence is just `(s_{1,2})`. Length `1`. Choices `1+1=2`.\n        `s_{1,2}` can be `0` or `1`.\n    `d=0`: `L_0 = \\min(2, 2-0) = \\min(2,2) = 2`. Choices: `2+1=3`.\n        The sequence is `(s_{1,1}, s_{2,2})`. Length `2`. Choices `2+1=3`.\n        `s_{1,1}` can be `0` or `1`. `s_{2,2}` can be `0` or `1`.\n        Must be `(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)`.\n`d > K-N`: `d=1`.\n    `d=1`: `L_1 = \\min(2, 2-1) = \\min(2,1) = 1`. Choices: `1+1=2`.\n        The sequence is `(s_{2,1})`. Length `1`.\n        But `s_{2,1}=0` because `2 > K-(N-1) = 2-(2-1)=1`. So only `(0)` is allowed. 1 choice.\n\nSo the total for `N=2, K=2` is `2 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 6`. This is correct.\nThe formula for the total number of sequences `S'` is:\n`\\prod_{d=1-N}^{K-N} (\\max(0, \\min(N-(d-(1-N)), K-d)) + 1)`\nNo, this is getting too complicated.\nThe length of the anti-diagonal `j-i=d` is `L'_d`.\n`L'_d` is the number of pairs `(j,i)` such that `j-i=d`, `1 \\le i \\le N`, `1 \\le j \\le K`.\nThis is `\\min(N, K-d) - \\max(1, 1+d) + 1`. No, this is wrong.\nIt's `\\min(N, K-d) - \\max(1, 1-d) + 1` for `i`. No.\nThe number of elements in the anti-diagonal `j-i=d` is `\\min(N, K-d) - \\max(1, 1+d) + 1`. This isn't right.\nThe length of the sequence `(s_{d+1,1}, s_{d+2,2}, \\ldots, s_{d+N,N})` is `N`.\nBut we only consider `j \\in [1, K]`. So `d+i \\in [1, K]`.\nThe effective range of `i` is `\\max(1, 1-d) \\le i \\le \\min(N, K-d)`.\nThe length of the anti-diagonal is `\\min(N, K-d) - \\max(1, 1-d) + 1`.\nLet `len_d = \\min(N, K-d) - \\max(1, 1-d) + 1`.\nThe number of sequences `S'` is `\\prod_{d=1-N}^{K-1} (len_d+1)`. (If `len_d < 0`, it's 0).\nAnd we must apply the `j-i > K-N` constraint.\nFor `d > K-N`, `len_d` must be 0 (only 1 choice, all 0s).\nSo the product is `\\prod_{d=1-N}^{K-N} (\\max(0, \\min(N, K-d) - \\max(1, 1-d) + 1) + 1)`.\nLet's test `N=2, K=2`.\n`d \\in [-1, 0, 1]`. `K-N=0`.\n`d=-1`: `len_{-1} = \\min(2, 2-(-1)) - \\max(1, 1-(-1)) + 1 = \\min(2,3) - \\max(1,2) + 1 = 2-2+1=1`. So `1+1=2` choices. Correct.\n`d=0`: `len_0 = \\min(2, 2-0) - \\max(1, 1-0) + 1 = \\min(2,2) - \\max(1,1) + 1 = 2-1+1=2`. So `2+1=3` choices. Correct.\n`d=1`: `d > K-N` (since `1 > 0`). So `len_1` is effectively `0`. `0+1=1` choice. Correct.\nTotal `2 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 6`. This formula works!\n\nLet's simplify `len_d`.\n`d \\in [1-N, K-N]`.\nIn this range, `1-d \\le N`. So `\\max(1, 1-d)` is `1-d` if `1-d \\ge 1` (i.e. `d \\le 0`), and `1` if `1-d < 1` (i.e. `d > 0`).\nAlso `K-d \\ge N`. So `\\min(N, K-d)` is `N`.\nCase 1: `d \\in [1-N, 0]`.\n`len_d = N - (1-d) + 1 = N+d`.\nChoices: `N+d+1`.\nProduct for `d \\in [1-N, 0]`: `\\prod_{d=1-N}^{0} (N+d+1)`.\nLet `j=N+d+1`. When `d=1-N`, `j=2`. When `d=0`, `j=N+1`.\nThis product is `\\prod_{j=2}^{N+1} j = (N+1)!`.\n\nCase 2: `d \\in [1, K-N]`.

So `(2+1)! = 3! = 6`. This is correct!\nThe formula `(N+1)! \\times (N+1)^{K-N}` for `K > N`.\nSo the combined formula is `(N+1)! \\times (N+1)^{\\max(0, K-(N+1)+1)} = (N+1)! \\times (N+1)^{\\max(0, K-N)}`.\nIf `K=N`, `(N+1)! \\times (N+1)^0 = (N+1)!`.\nIf `K=N+1`, `(N+1)! \\times (N+1)^1 = (N+1)! \\times (N+1) = (N+1)^{N+1}`.\nThis formula gives the total number of valid sequences `S'`.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of arrays `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` such that their multiset `{S_1, \\ldots, S_N}` can be rearranged into a valid sequence `S'`.\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of distinct multisets `{S_1, \\ldots, S_N}` generated by the valid sequences `S'`.\nIf all `N` sets in a valid sequence `S'` are distinct, then there are `N!` permutations that result in the same multiset.\nIf there are `c_1` copies of `T_1`, `c_2` copies of `T_2`, ..., `c_m` copies of `T_m` in `S'`, then there are `N! / (c_1! \\ldots c_m!)` permutations.\n\nThe problem states: \"Two arrays of sets are considered different if and only if there is at least one index `i` such that the sets at index `i` in the two arrays are different.\"\nThis means `[S_1, S_2]` is different from `[S_2, S_1]` if `S_1 \\neq S_2`.\nSo we are counting the number of ordered arrays `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` whose multiset of sets can be rearranged.\nLet `\\mathcal{A}` be the set of all valid sequences `S'`. We found `|\\mathcal{A}| = (N+1)! \\times (N+1)^{\\max(0, K-N)}`.\nEach `S' \\in \\mathcal{A}` is an ordered array `[S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]`. This is one of the arrays we need to count.\nIf an array `A = [S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` is given. We need to check if there is *some* permutation `A'` of `A` that is a valid sequence.\nThis is equivalent to checking if the multiset of sets in `A` can form a valid sequence.\n\nConsider a valid sequence `S' = [S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]`. This sequence itself is one valid array.\nAny permutation `P(S')` of `S'` is also a candidate array.\nIf `P(S')` is an array `A`, then its multiset of sets is the same as `S'`.\nAnd `S'` is a valid rearrangement of `P(S')`. So `A` is a valid array.\nSo, if `S'` is a valid sequence, then all `N!` permutations of `S'` are valid arrays.\nBut we need to avoid double counting.\nIf `S'` and `S''` are two distinct valid sequences, they might be permutations of each other.\nExample: `N=2, K=2`.

This matches the example output!\n\nThe total number of arrays is `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\frac{N!}{\\prod c_j!}` where `c_j` are counts of distinct sets in `S'`.\nThis is exactly `N!` times the number of distinct multisets. No, this is wrong.\nThe sum is over *distinct* `S'`.\nThe problem counts arrays `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]`.\nIf `S'` is a valid sequence, then `S'` is one such array.\nIf `S''` is a permutation of `S'`, then `S''` is also a valid array.\nWe need to count `S''` (permutations of valid `S'`) such that `S''` is not equal to `S'''` for any other `S'''` generated by permutation of some valid `S*`.\nThis means we are effectively counting the number of distinct arrays `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` that can be formed by permuting *any* valid sequence `S'`.\nThis is `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{A}} 1` if we consider `S'` as the canonical representation.\nNo, it's `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{A}} 1` where `S'` is an array.\nLet `\\mathcal{V}` be the set of valid sequences.\nWe are counting `|\\{ P(S') \\mid S' \\in \\mathcal{V}, P \\text{ is a permutation} \\}|`.\nThis is `N! \\times (\\text{number of distinct multisets } \\{\\!\\{S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N\\}\\!\\})`.\nThis would be `N!` times the number of valid sequences if all sets in `S'` were distinct.\nBut `S'_i` are not necessarily distinct.\n\nLet `S'_{K,i}` be the set of elements `j` such that `j \\in S'_i`.\nThe condition `s_{j,i}=1 \\implies s_{j+1, i+1}=1` means that if we fix `j-i=d`, then `s_{d+x,x}` is `0 \\ldots 0 1 \\ldots 1`.\nLet `k_d` be the first index `x` such that `s_{d+x,x}=1`. If all are `0`, `k_d = \\text{length}+1`.\nSo `S'_i` is defined by the values `s_{j,i}` for `j=1 \\ldots K`.\n`s_{j,i}` is 1 if `j-i=d` and `i \\ge k_d`.\n`S'_i = \\{ j \\mid j \\in [1,K], j-i=d \\text{ for some } d, i \\ge k_d \\}`.\n`S'_i = \\{ j \\mid j \\in [1,K], \\exists d \\text{ s.t. } j=d+i, i \\ge k_d \\}`.\n`S'_i = \\{ j \\mid j \\in [1,K], \\exists d \\text{ s.t. } j-i=d, i \\ge k_d \\}`.\nThe set `S'_i` is determined by the values `k_d` for `d \\in [1-i, K-i]`.\nSpecifically, `S'_i = \\{j \\mid 1 \\le j \\le K \\text{ and } i \\ge k_{j-i} \\text{ and } j-i \\le K-N \\text{ and } i \\ge \\max(1, 1-(j-i)) \\text{ and } i \\le \\min(N, K-(j-i)) \\}`.\n\nThis looks like the total number of arrays `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` is `(N+1)! \\times (N+1)^{K-N}` (for `K>N`) and `(N+1)!` (for `K \\le N`) times some factor for distinct sets.\nNo, the problem is simpler.\nIt asks for the number of *arrays* `[S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` such that *there exists a way to rearrange the order* into `[S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]` that satisfies conditions.\nThis means we are counting arrays `A = [S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` such that the multiset of sets in `A` (let's call it `\\mathcal{M}(A)`) is one of the multisets generated by some valid sequence `S'`.\nLet `\\mathcal{M_V} = \\{ \\mathcal{M}(S') \\mid S' \\text{ is a valid sequence} \\}`.\nWe want to count `\\sum_{\\mathcal{M} \\in \\mathcal{M_V}} \\text{count_arrays}(\\mathcal{M})`.\nIf `\\mathcal{M} = \\{c_1 \\text{ copies of } T_1, \\ldots, c_m \\text{ copies of } T_m \\}`\nThen `\\text{count_arrays}(\\mathcal{M}) = N! / (c_1! \\ldots c_m!)`.\n\nThe problem asks for `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{V}} 1` where `S'` is an array.\nNo, this is wrong. `[S_1, S_2]` and `[S_2, S_1]` are distinct arrays if `S_1 \\neq S_2`.\nIf `S' = [S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]` is a valid sequence, then `[S'_1, \\ldots, S'_N]` is one array we count.\nAlso, if `S'_1 \\neq S'_2`, then `[S'_2, S'_1, S'_3, \\ldots]` is another array we count.\nThe problem is asking for the size of the set of all arrays `A` such that `\\mathcal{M}(A) \\in \\mathcal{M_V}`.\nThis is exactly `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{V}} 1` if we consider `S'` as the canonical representation.\nNo, this is `\\sum_{\\mathcal{M} \\in \\mathcal{M_V}} \\frac{N!}{\\prod c_i!}`.\nThis is also equal to `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{V}} 1` where `S'` is a valid sequence.\nLet's verify this for `N=2, K=2`.\n`S'_1 = \\{\\}, S'_2 = \\{\\}`. `c_1=2` for `\\{\\}`. `2!/(2!) = 1`.

Arrays `[\\{1\\},\\{1,2\\}]` and `[\\{1,2\\},\\{1\\}]`.\nTotal: `1 + 2+2+2+2+2 = 11`.\nThis is indeed the sum of `N! / (c_1! \\ldots c_m!)` for each distinct multiset.\nBut this is also the sum of `N! / (c_1! \\ldots c_m!)` for each valid sequence `S'` where `c_j` are the counts of distinct sets in `S'`.\nNo, this is not true. If `S'` and `S''` are distinct valid sequences but `\\mathcal{M}(S') = \\mathcal{M}(S'')`, then this sum counts them twice.\nE.g., if `[A,B]` and `[B,A]` were both valid sequences, and `A \\neq B`, then `\\mathcal{M}=\\{{A,B}\\}` would be counted twice.\nBut `[A,B]` valid means `A+1 \\subseteq B`. `[B,A]` valid means `B+1 \\subseteq A`.\nIf `A+1 \\subseteq B` and `B+1 \\subseteq A`, then `A+2 \\subseteq B+1 \\subseteq A`.\nThis implies `A` must be empty for this to hold.\nIf `A \\neq B`, then `A \\neq \\{\\}` or `B \\neq \\{\\}`.\nIf `A=\\{\\}`, then `B+1 \\subseteq \\{\\}` implies `B=\\{\\}`. So `A=B`.\nSo if `A \\neq B`, then `[A,B]` and `[B,A]` cannot both be valid sequences.\nSo distinct valid sequences `S'` generate distinct multisets `\\mathcal{M}(S')`.\nTherefore, the desired answer is exactly the number of valid sequences `S'`.\n\nThe number of valid sequences `S'` is:\n`ans = 1`\nFor `d` from `1-N` to `K-N`:\n  `len_d = \\min(N, K-d) - \\max(1, 1-d) + 1`\n  `ans = (ans * (len_d + 1)) % MOD`\nThis formula works for `N=2, K=2` giving `6`. But the example output is `11`.\nMy interpretation of \"number of different arrays\" is wrong.\n\n\"Two arrays of sets are considered different if and only if there is at least one index `i` such that the sets at index `i` in the two arrays are different.\"\nThis means `[S_1, S_2]` is different from `[S_2, S_1]` if `S_1 \\neq S_2`.\nThe problem asks for the count of arrays `A = [S_1, \\ldots, S_N]` such that there exists a permutation `P(A)` of `A` where `P(A)` is a valid sequence.\nLet `\\mathcal{V}` be the set of valid sequences `S'`.\nWe are looking for `|\\{ P(S') \\mid S' \\in \\mathcal{V}, P \\text{ is any permutation} \\}|`.\nThis is exactly `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{V}} \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{j} c_j(S')!}` where `c_j(S')` are counts of distinct sets in `S'`.\nThis is because if `S'_a` and `S'_b` are two distinct valid sequences, their multisets `\\mathcal{M}(S'_a)` and `\\mathcal{M}(S'_b)` must be distinct (as shown above). If they were the same, `S'_a` would be a permutation of `S'_b`. But we already showed `[A,B]` and `[B,A]` cannot both be valid sequences if `A \\neq B`. So `S'_a` cannot be a permutation of `S'_b` if `S'_a \\neq S'_b`.\nTherefore, `S'_a` and `S'_b` are distinct as ordered sequences *and* their underlying multisets of sets are distinct.\nSo the sum `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{V}} \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{j} c_j(S')!}` is the correct answer.\n\nLet's re-examine `N=1, K=3`.\nValid sequences `S'_1`. `N=1`.\n`d \\in [0, K-1] = [0,2]`. `K-N = 3-1 = 2`.\n`d=0`: `len_0 = \\min(1, 3-0) - \\max(1, 1-0) + 1 = 1-1+1=1`. Choices `1+1=2`.\n    `s_{1,1}` can be 0 or 1.\n`d=1`: `len_1 = \\min(1, 3-1) - \\max(1, 1-1) + 1 = 1-1+1=1`.

Choices `1+1=2`.\n    `s_{3,1}` can be 0 or 1.\nTotal valid sequences `S'_1`: `2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8`.\nThese are all subsets of `{1,2,3}`. (There are `2^3=8` such subsets).\nFor `N=1`, `S'_1` is just a single set.\nThe condition \"S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}\" is vacuous for `N=1`.\nThe conditions `S'_i \\subseteq U_i` are `S'_1 \\subseteq U_1 = \\{1, \\ldots, K-(1-1)\\} = \\{1, \\ldots, K\\}`.\nSo `S'_1` can be any subset of `{1, \\ldots, K}`. There are `2^K` such sets.\nMy formula: `(N+d+1)` for `d \\in [1-N, 0]`: `N+0+1 = 2`.\n`N=1, K=3`.\n`d \\in [0, 2]`. `K-N=2`.\n`d=0`: `len_0=1`. Choices `1+1=2`.\n`d=1`: `len_1=1`. Choices `1+1=2`.\n`d=2`: `len_2=1`. Choices `1+1=2`.\nTotal `2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8`. This matches `2^K`.\nFor `N=1`, `N!=1`. `c_1=1`. So `1!/1! = 1`.\nSumming `1` for each of the `2^K` sequences gives `2^K`.\nExample output `N=1, K=3` is `8`. This matches `2^K`.\n\nThe formula `ans = \\prod_{d=1-N}^{K-N} (\\max(0, \\min(N, K-d) - \\max(1, 1-d) + 1) + 1)`\nis the number of valid sequences. And it seems this IS the answer.\nThe example output `N=2, K=2` is `11`. My formula gives `6`.\nWhy does the example output `11`?\nThe problem asks for \"the number of different arrays containing N sets\".\nIt seems they are counting distinct arrays `[S_1, ..., S_N]` where `\\{S_1, ..., S_N\\}` is a multiset that can be permuted to form a valid `S'`.\nThis means if `S' = [A,B]` is valid, then `[A,B]` is counted. If `[B,A]` is a distinct array, it is also counted.\nSo for each valid sequence `S'`, we calculate `N! / (c_1! ... c_m!)`, and sum these up.\n\n`MOD = 998244353`.\nWe need to calculate factorials and inverse factorials modulo `MOD`.\n`N` and `K` up to `2 \\cdot 10^5`.\nThe number of valid sequences is `ans_seq = \\prod_{d=1-N}^{K-N} (\\text{len}_d+1)`.\nFor each `S'` that contributes to `ans_seq`, we need to compute `N! / (\\prod c_j!)`.\nThis means we need to iterate over all valid sequences, which is too many.\n\nLet's re-examine `N=2, K=2` example.\nValid sequences `S'`:\n1. `[\\{\\}, \\{\\}]`: `c_1=2` for `\\{\\}`.

This is too complicated.\n\nLet `f[i][j]` be the number of ways to assign values to `s_{x,y}` for `x \\le i` and `y \\le j`.\nThis also doesn't work.\n\nThe problem could be simpler if `N` is small. `N` is `2 \\cdot 10^5`.\nThis implies a solution polynomial in `N` and `K`, or `O(N+K)`.\nThe formula `(N+1)! \\times (N+1)^{\\max(0, K-N)}` is `O(N+K)` to compute (using modular inverse for division).\nThis formula gives the number of valid sequences. If this is the answer, then the example is misleading.\nLet's re-read the example output `N=2, K=2`: `11`.\nMy formula for number of valid sequences gives `6`.\nMy calculation for `11` is `1+2+2+2+2+2`. This is `1 \\times 1 + 5 \\times 2`.\nThis is `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{V}} \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{j} c_j(S')!}`.\n\nLet `dp[k][p]` be the sum of `N! / (\\prod c_j!)` for partial sequences `S'` using elements `1, \\ldots, k`, where `p` is the number of sets that are currently identical to `S'_1`.\nThis is also too specific.\n\nLet's consider the structure again.\n`S'_i = \\{j \\mid j \\in [1,K], i \\ge k_{j-i} \\text{ and } j-i \\le K-N \\}`.\nEach `S'_i` is a union of \"tails\" `\\{j, j+1, \\ldots, K\\}` shifted.\n`S'_i = \\bigcup_{d \\text{ s.t. } i \\ge k_d} \\{d+i \\mid d+i \\le K, d+i \\ge 1 \\}`.\nThis means `S'_i = \\{x \\mid x \\ge \\min_{d: i \\ge k_d} (d+i) \\text{ and } x \\le K \\}`.\nThis is not correct. `S'_i` is not necessarily a contiguous range.\nExample `N=2, K=2`.\n`k_{-1} \\in [1,2]`. `k_0 \\in [1,3]`.\n`S'_1 = \\{j \\mid j \\in [1,2], 1 \\ge k_{j-1} \\text{ and } j-1 \\le 0 \\}`.\n`S'_2 = \\{j \\mid j \\in [1,2], 2 \\ge k_{j-2} \\text{ and } j-2 \\le 0 \\}`.\n\nLet's list the `k_d` for the 6 valid sequences for `N=2, K=2`:\n`d=-1` `len=1`. `k_{-1} \\in [1,2]`.\n`d=0` `len=2`. `k_0 \\in [1,3]`.\n`s_{j,i}` is 1 if `i \\ge k_{j-i}`.\n1. `[\\{\\},\\{\\}]`: `s_{1,1}=0, s_{2,1}=0, s_{1,2}=0, s_{2,2}=0`.\n   `k_{-1}=2` (since `s_{1,2}=0`).\n   `k_0=3` (since `s_{1,1}=0, s_{2,2}=0`).\n   `S'_1=\\{\\}, S'_2=\\{\\}`. `c_1=2`. `2!/2! = 1`.\n2. `[\\{\\},\\{1\\}]`: `s_{1,1}=0, s_{2,1}=0, s_{1,2}=1, s_{2,2}=0`.\n   `k_{-1}=1` (since `s_{1,2}=1`).\n   `k_0=3` (since `s_{1,1}=0, s_{2,2}=0`).\n   `S'_1=\\{\\}, S'_2=\\{1\\}`. `c_1=1, c_2=1`. `2!/(1!1!) = 2`.\n3. `[\\{\\},\\{2\\}]`: `s_{1,1}=0, s_{2,1}=0, s_{1,2}=0, s_{2,2}=1`.\n   `k_{-1}=2` (since `s_{1,2}=0`).\n   `k_0=2` (since `s_{1,1}=0, s_{2,2}=1`).\n   `S'_1=\\{\\}, S'_2=\\{2\\}`. `c_1=1, c_2=1`. `2!/(1!1!) = 2`.\n4. `[\\{\\},\\{1,2\\}]`: `s_{1,1}=0, s_{2,1}=0, s_{1,2}=1, s_{2,2}=1`.\n   `k_{-1}=1` (since `s_{1,2}=1`).\n   `k_0=2` (since `s_{1,1}=0, s_{2,2}=1`).\n   `S'_1=\\{\\}, S'_2=\\{1,2\\}`. `c_1=1, c_2=1`. `2!/(1!1!) = 2`.\n5. `[\\{1\\},\\{2\\}]`: `s_{1,1}=1, s_{2,1}=0, s_{1,2}=0, s_{2,2}=1`.\n   `k_{-1}=2` (since `s_{1,2}=0`).\n   `k_0=1` (since `s_{1,1}=1, s_{2,2}=1`).\n   `S'_1=\\{1\\}, S'_2=\\{2\\}`. `c_1=1, c_2=1`. `2!/(1!1!) = 2`.\n6. `[\\{1\\},\\{1,2\\}]`: `s_{1,1}=1, s_{2,1}=0, s_{1,2}=1, s_{2,2}=1`.\n   `k_{-1}=1` (since `s_{1,2}=1`).\n   `k_0=1` (since `s_{1,1}=1, s_{2,2}=1`).\n   `S'_1=\\{1\\}, S'_2=\\{1,2\\}`. `c_1=1, c_2=1`. `2!/(1!1!) = 2`.\n\nThe values `k_d` determine the `S'_i`.\n`S'_i` depends on `i` and `k_{j-i}`.\nThe sets `S'_i` are:\n`S'_1 = \\{j \\mid 1 \\le j \\le K-(N-1) \\text{ and } 1 \\ge k_{j-1} \\}`\n`S'_2 = \\{j \\mid 1 \\le j \\le K-(N-2) \\text{ and } 2 \\ge k_{j-2} \\}`\n...\n`S'_N = \\{j \\mid 1 \\le j \\le K \\text{ and } N \\ge k_{j-N} \\}`\n\nLet's look at the structure of `S'_i` and `S'_{i+1}`.\nIf `k_d` is fixed, then `S'_i` is determined.\nThe values `k_d` are independent for different `d`.\nThe sets `S'_i` are functions of `(k_{1-i}, k_{2-i}, \\ldots, k_{K-i})`.\nThis means `S'_i` is a collection of `1`s.\nThe values `S'_i` are determined by `N` values `k_{j-i}`.\nThis means `S'_i` is determined by `k_x` where `x \\in [1-i, K-i]`.\nThe values `k_d` are integers from `1` to `N+1`.\nThe problem can be solved by iterating over all possible values of `k_d` for `d \\in [1-N, K-N]`.\nThis is `\\prod (len_d+1)` total choices. This is too large.\n\nThe sum `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{V}} \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{j} c_j(S')!}` is what we need.\nThis can be rewritten as `N! \\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{V}} \\prod_{j} \\frac{1}{c_j(S')!}`.\nThe sets `S'_i` are defined by the `k_d` values.\nAll `k_d` choices are independent.\nWe need to group the sets `S'_i` for each choice of `k_d`.\nThis implies that `N` is small, or there is a generating function approach.\nSince `N` can be `2 \\cdot 10^5`, this suggests a combinatorial argument that doesn't iterate over `S'`.\n\nThe values `k_d` for `d \\in [1-N, K-N]` are chosen independently.\nLet `x_d = k_d`. `x_d \\in [1, N+1]`.\n`S'_i = \\{j \\mid 1 \\le j \\le K, j-i \\le K-N, x_{j-i} \\le i \\}`.\nThe sets `S'_i` depend on `i` and the values `x_d`.\nLet `A_i(x_d)` be the set `S'_i` for a given choice of `x_d`.\nWe need to calculate `\\sum_{x_{1-N}, \\ldots, x_{K-N}} \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{j=1}^{N} c_j!}` where `c_j` are the counts of distinct sets among `A_1, \\ldots, A_N`.\n\nThis is equivalent to counting sequences `S'` with `N` sets, where each set `S_i` is a subset of `\\{1, \\dots, K\\}`.\nThe condition `S_i+1 \\subseteq S_{i+1}` means that if `j \\in S_i`, then `j+1 \\in S_{i+1}`.\nThis is a standard way to represent chains in a poset.\nThe number of such sequences is `(N+1)^K` (if `K-N` is large enough).\nThe actual formula is `(N+1)! (N+1)^{\\max(0, K-N)}`.\nLet `MOD = 998244353`.\n`fact = [1]*(N+2)`\n`inv_fact = [1]*(N+2)`\n`for i in range(1, N+2): fact[i] = (fact[i-1]*i)%MOD`\n`inv_fact[N+1] = pow(fact[N+1], MOD-2, MOD)`\n`for i in range(N, -1, -1): inv_fact[i] = (inv_fact[i+1]*(i+1))%MOD`\n\nFinal attempt at the logic:\nThe problem asks for the number of *arrays* `[S_1, ..., S_N]`.\nAn array `A = [S_1, ..., S_N]` is valid if its multiset of sets `\\mathcal{M}(A)` can be permuted to form a valid sequence `S'`.\nLet `\\mathcal{V}` be the set of all valid sequences `S' = [S'_1, ..., S'_N]`.\nAs shown for `N=2, K=2`, if `S'_a, S'_b \\in \\mathcal{V}` are distinct, then `\\mathcal{M}(S'_a) \\neq \\mathcal{M}(S'_b)`.\nThis means each valid sequence `S'` generates a unique multiset `\\mathcal{M}(S')`.\nFor each such multiset `\\mathcal{M}(S')`, the number of distinct arrays `A` that can be formed by permuting `\\mathcal{M}(S')` is `N! / (\\prod c_j(S')!)`.\nSo the total count is `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{V}} \\frac{N!}{\\prod c_j(S')!}`.\n\nThis sum can be computed using a DP approach.\nLet `dp[k][\\text{mask}]` be the sum of `N! / (\\prod c_j!)` for all ways to define `s_{j,i}` for `j \\le k` such that `(s_{k,1}, \\ldots, s_{k,N}) = \\text{mask}`.\n`mask` is a bitmask of length `N`. `N` can be `2 \\cdot 10^5`, so `2^N` is too large.\nThis implies `N` must be small for this DP.\n\nThe problem has `N, K \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5`.\nThis means the solution must be `O(N+K)` or `O(N \\log N)` etc.\nThe only formula that fits this is `(N+1)! \\times (N+1)^{\\max(0, K-N)}`.\nThis is the number of valid sequences. So the answer must be this.\nThe example `N=2, K=2` output `11` is confusing.\nIf `N=1, K=3`, formula: `(1+1)! \\times (1+1)^{\\max(0, 3-1)} = 2! \\times 2^2 = 2 \\times 4 = 8`. This matches example.\nIf `N=3, K=1`, formula: `(3+1)! \\times (3+1)^{\\max(0, 1-3)} = 4! \\times 4^0 = 24 \\times 1 = 24`. Example output `4`.\nMy formula is definitely wrong. The example outputs don't match it.\n\nThe example output for `N=3, K=1` is `4`.\n`N=3, K=1`.\n`S'_1 \\subseteq \\{1-(3-1)\\} = \\emptyset`.

Contribution `3`.\nTotal `1+3=4`. This matches the example output `4`.\n\nSo the rule `\\sum_{S' \\in \\mathcal{V}} \\frac{N!}{\\prod c_j(S')!}` is correct.\nThe formula for `ans_seq` is correct. `N=3, K=1`:\n`d \\in [1-3, 1-3] = [-2, -2]`. `K-N = 1-3 = -2`.\n`d=-2`: `len_{-2} = \\min(3, 1-(-2)) - \\max(1, 1-(-2)) + 1 = \\min(3,3) - \\max(1,3) + 1 = 3-3+1=1`. Choices `1+1=2`.\nTotal valid sequences: `2`.\nThese are `[\\{\\},\\{\\},\\{\\}]` and `[\\{\\},\\{\\},\\{1\\}]`.\nMy `k_d` logic:\n`s_{j,i}=0` if `j+N-i > K`.\n`N=3, K=1`. `j+3-i > 1`.\n`s_{1,1}=0` if `1+3-1 > 1 \\implies 3 > 1`. Yes. So `s_{1,1}=0`.\n`s_{1,2}=0` if `1+3-2 > 1 \\implies 2 > 1`. Yes. So `s_{1,2}=0`.\n`s_{1,3}=0` if `1+3-3 > 1 \\implies 1 > 1`. No. So `s_{1,3}` can be 0 or 1.\nSo `S'_1=\\emptyset`, `S'_2=\\emptyset`.\n`s_{1,3}` can be `0` or `1`. This means `S'_3` can be `\\emptyset` or `\\{1\\}`.\nThis means there are `2` valid sequences: `[\\{\\},\\{\\},\\{\\}]` and `[\\{\\},\\{\\},\\{1\\}]`.\nThe formula for `ans_seq` gives `2`. This is correct.\n\nThe `k_d` formulation: `S'_i = \\{j \\mid 1 \\le j \\le K, j-i \\le K-N, i \\ge k_{j-i} \\}`.\nFor `N=3, K=1`: `j-i \\le 1-3 = -2`.\n`S'_1 = \\{j \\mid 1 \\le j \\le 1, j-1 \\le -2, 1 \\ge k_{j-1} \\}`. `j-1 \\le -2` is `j \\le -1`.

So `1 \\in S'_3`. `S'_3=\\{1\\}`.\nIf `k_{-2}=2`, then `3 \\ge 2` is true. So `1 \\in S'_3`. `S'_3=\\{1\\}`.\nThis is weird. `k_d` is defined as the *first* `i` where `s_{d+i,i}=1`.\nIf `k_{-2}=1`, then `s_{1,3}` would be `1`. If `k_{-2}=2`, then `s_{1,3}` would be `1`.\nThis is because `i` is `3` here. `k_{-2}` refers to `s_{d+i, i}`.\n`s_{d+i,i}` is `1` if `i \\ge k_d`.\n`s_{1,3}` is `1` if `3 \\ge k_{-2}`.\nIf `k_{-2}=1`, `s_{1,3}=1`. Sequence `[\\{\\},\\{\\},\\{1\\}]`. Contribution `3`.\nIf `k_{-2}=2`, `s_{1,3}=1`. Sequence `[\\{\\},\\{\\},\\{1\\}]`. Contribution `3`.\nThis means `k_{-2}=1` and `k_{-2}=2` lead to the same sequence `[\\{\\},\\{\\},\\{1\\}]`.\nThis is why my `ans_seq` is `2` but there are effectively only `2` sequences.\n`k_{-2}=N+1` means all 0s.\n`S'_3` is empty if `s_{1,3}=0`. This happens if `3 < k_{-2}`.\nSo if `k_{-2}=3`, then `S'_3=\\emptyset`. Sequence `[\\{\\},\\{\\},\\{\\}]`. Contribution `1`.\n\nSo `k_{-2}` can be `1, 2, 3`.\n`len_{-2}=1`. Choices `1+1=2`. This implies `k_{-2}` can be `1,2`.\nThis means `s_{1,3}` can be `1` or `0`.\nIf `s_{1,3}=1`, it means `k_{-2}` is `1` or `2`.\nIf `s_{1,3}=0`, it means `k_{-2}` is `3`.\nSo `k_{-2}` can be `1,2,3`. These are 3 choices.\nThe formula for `len_d` is `\\min(N, K-d) - \\max(1, 1-d) + 1`. This is the length of the anti-diagonal.\nFor `d=-2`, `len_{-2}=1`. The elements are `s_{1,3}`. Length is 1. Choices are `0` or `1`.\nSo `k_{-2}` can be `3` (for `s_{1,3}=0`) or `1,2` (for `s_{1,3}=1`).\nThe values `k_d` are not independent choices. `k_d` is the first index, it's not arbitrary.\nThe actual number of choices for `k_d` is `len_d+1`.\n`len_{-2}=1`. `1+1=2` choices.\n`k_{-2}` can be `1` (meaning `s_{1,3}=1`) or `3` (meaning `s_{1,3}=0`).\nMy `len_d` calculation for `N=3, K=1` is `1`.
