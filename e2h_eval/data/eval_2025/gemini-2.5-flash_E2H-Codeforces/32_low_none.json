Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition for Array Stabilization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Array Stabilization\" problem.  Here's my thought process.  I'm given an array `a` of integers, and the instability is just the difference between the maximum and minimum values.  The goal is to remove exactly one element and minimize this instability in the resulting array. I'm thinking about the most efficient way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to really understand what's going on.  The constraints seem reasonable, `n` up to 10^5, and the values are also bounded. The example helped, and I immediately realized that to minimize instability, you'd want the difference between the maximum and the minimum to be as small as possible.\n\nSince I have to remove *one* element, it clicked: I can achieve a smaller instability by either reducing the maximum value or increasing the minimum value of the remaining set. I started thinking how different removals affect `max` and `min`: removing a number *not* the max/min wouldn't change the instability, or at best, only in trivial cases.\n\nThen it became clear. The key is to examine the implications of removing the maximum or the minimum element. Removing the maximum leaves the second-largest value as the new maximum.  Removing the minimum leaves the second-smallest value as the new minimum. And that's it! That's the core of the solution.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy becomes clear. I'll sort the array `a`, so finding the max, min, second max, and second min are trivial. After sorting, I'll compare the instability from removing the minimum element (max - second min) versus removing the maximum (second max - min). The smaller of those two instability values is the answer. That is the quickest way.\n",
