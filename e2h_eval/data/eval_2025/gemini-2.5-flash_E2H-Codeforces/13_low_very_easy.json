For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script that can tell me whether a given set of three notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or something else entirely (\"strange\").  This seems pretty straightforward, given my background.\n\nFirst, I need to conceptualize the problem. I'm dealing with a 12-note chromatic scale, which I'll represent with integers 0 through 11.  Distance between notes is measured in semitones, and it's always directional – from the lower note to the higher.  I'm using the letters provided and will need to create a mapping for them.\n\nThen, there's the triad itself: it's an unordered set of three notes.  I'll need to figure out a way to handle the fact that the order doesn't matter initially, but *does* matter when classifying it.\n\nA *major* triad has a specific interval structure: a major third (4 semitones) followed by a minor third (3 semitones).  A *minor* triad has the opposite structure: a minor third followed by a major third.  The key is that the total distance, regardless of the order, is always 7 semitones.\n\nNow, how to translate this into code?\n\n1.  **Note Mapping:** I'll use a dictionary to map note names (strings) to their integer representations.  That's a no-brainer.\n\n2.  **Distance Calculation:**  The distance between two notes, given their numerical values, is `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. This effectively handles the cyclic nature of the scale, wrapping around when needed.\n\n3.  **Input Processing:**  I'll need to take the input triad, convert each note to its numerical value using the mapping dictionary, and store these values in a list.\n\n4.  **Permutation Checking:**  This is the tricky part. Since the order doesn't matter initially, but the order *does* matter for identifying major and minor chords, I must check *all* possible orderings of the three notes.  There are 3! = 6 permutations. For each permutation, I'll calculate the intervals between the notes and see if they match the major or minor triad patterns.  If it matches major, I'll return \"major.\" If it matches minor, I'll return \"minor\". If it's none, it must be \"strange.\"\n\nThis gives me the basic blueprint. I'll need to flesh out the permutation generation and interval comparison logic within my script. This should be a fun little exercise in combinatorial thinking!\n",
