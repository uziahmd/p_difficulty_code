The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Radio Tower Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got a competitive programming problem on my hands, something about radio towers and probabilities. The goal is to figure out the probability of a valid signal power configuration, given some random tower placements, and the output needs to be modulo 998244353. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, the setup: We have towns numbered 0 to n+1, and the towers are randomly placed in towns 1 to n.  Each tower has a signal power. The chance of a tower being in a given town is 1/2.  A tower at position *i* with power *p* covers a range of towns *i-p+1* to *i+p-1*.\n\nThere are two critical constraints:\n\n1.  Towns 0 and n+1 *cannot* receive any signal.  This immediately gives us some boundary conditions for the towers' powers.  If a tower is at position *i*, its power *p<sub>i</sub>* needs to be small enough so that it doesn't spill over to town 0 or town n+1. That means for any given tower *i*, its power *p<sub>i</sub>* has to satisfy two conditions: it must be less than *i+1* (to avoid covering town 0) and less than *n+2-i* (to avoid covering town *n+1*). This translates to *p<sub>i</sub>* being between 1 and min(*i*, *n+1-i*), inclusive.\n\n2.  Each of the towns from 1 to *n* *must* receive a signal, and only from *one* tower.  This means the covered ranges must *exactly* cover the segment [1, *n*], and there can be no overlap.\n\nEssentially, I'm dealing with a combinatorial problem.  I need to determine the conditions under which a set of towers (defined by their positions *S*) can be configured with specific powers to satisfy these constraints. The powers have to be carefully chosen so that the ranges exactly cover [1, *n*] without any overlaps or spilling outside the bounds.\n\nThis looks like it could become computationally complex, but at least I've identified the key aspects I need to work with. I need a way to enumerate valid combinations of tower positions and signal powers and then calculate the probability. I think dynamic programming might be a good approach, or perhaps a more clever combinatorial insight is possible. I'll need to think about how to efficiently check for valid configurations.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that, given a random selection of towns for radio towers, we can assign signal powers to satisfy certain conditions. There are $n+2$ towns $0, \\dots, n+1$. Towers are built in towns $1, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$ each.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we choose a signal power $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nA tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$. This means towns $i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1$ are covered.\n\nThe conditions are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.\n   - For town $0$ not to be covered: $i-p_i+1 > 0 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n   - For town $n+1$ not to be covered: $i+p_i-1 < n+1 \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$.\n   - So, for each $i \\in S$, $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This ensures that the covered range $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ is always a subsegment of $[1, n]$.\n\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n   - This means the union of covered ranges $\\bigcup_{i \\in S} [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ must be exactly $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n   - Furthermore, these ranges must be disjoint. If two ranges $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ and $[j-p_j+1, j+p_j-1]$ (for $i, j \\in S$, $i \\ne j$) overlap, then any town in the overlap would be covered by two towers, violating the \"exactly one\" condition.\n\nLet's consider the properties of such a valid configuration.\nEach town $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ must be covered by exactly one tower $i \\in S$. This implies that $k \\in [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThe total length of all covered segments must be $n$. Since they are disjoint, $\\sum_{i \\in S} (2p_i-1) = n$.\n\nConsider the \"boundary\" towns $1$ and $n$.\nTown $1$ must be covered by some tower $i_1 \\in S$. Since $p_{i_1} \\le i_1$, the leftmost town covered by $i_1$ is $i_1-p_{i_1}+1$. For this to be $1$, we must have $i_1-p_{i_1}+1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1}=i_1$.\nSimilarly, town $n$ must be covered by some tower $i_n \\in S$. For this to be $n$, we must have $i_n+p_{i_n}-1 = n \\implies p_{i_n}=n+1-i_n$.\nIf $i_1=i_n$, then $p_{i_1}=i_1$ and $p_{i_1}=n+1-i_1$, so $i_1 = n+1-i_1 \\implies 2i_1=n+1$. This implies $n$ must be odd, and $i_1 = (n+1)/2$. In this case, the single tower at $(n+1)/2$ covers the entire range $[1, n]$ with power $p_{(n+1)/2} = (n+1)/2$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the covered segments. If $i \\in S$ has power $p_i$, it covers $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ means that $i-p_i+1 \\ge 1$ and $i+p_i-1 \\le n$.\nIf $p_i = i$, the segment is $[1, 2i-1]$.\nIf $p_i = n+1-i$, the segment is $[2i-n, n]$.\nIf $p_i < i$ and $p_i < n+1-i$, the segment is $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$, which is strictly contained within $[1, n]$.\n\nConsider the implications of disjoint segments that cover $[1, n]$.\nLet $S = \\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the towns where towers are built, sorted $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$.\nThe segments they cover are $[L_1, R_1], [L_2, R_2], \\dots, [L_k, R_k]$.\nTo cover $[1, n]$ exactly once, we must have $L_1=1$, $R_k=n$, and $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nThis means the entire range $[1, n]$ is partitioned into $k$ segments.\n$L_j = i_j - p_{i_j} + 1$ and $R_j = i_j + p_{i_j} - 1$.\n\nConsider the midpoints of the segments. The midpoint of $[L_j, R_j]$ is $i_j$.\nThe length of segment $j$ is $2p_{i_j}-1$.\nThe midpoint of the entire range $[1, n]$ is $(n+1)/2$.\nIf $k=1$, then $S=\\{i_1\\}$. $i_1$ must be $(n+1)/2$, and $p_{i_1}=(n+1)/2$. This is only possible if $n$ is odd.\nIf $n$ is odd, $i_1=(n+1)/2$ is an integer. A tower must be built at $(n+1)/2$. This tower covers towns $1, \\dots, n$. No other towers should be built.\nIf $n$ is even, $k$ must be at least 2.\n\nWhat if towns $1$ and $n$ are covered by towers $i$ and $j$ respectively, where $i \\ne j$?\nThen $p_i=i$ and $p_j=n+1-j$.\nThe segment from $i$ is $[1, 2i-1]$.\nThe segment from $j$ is $[2j-n, n]$.\nFor these to be disjoint and cover the ends of $[1, n]$, we must have $2i-1 < 2j-n$.\nAll other towers $x \\in S \\setminus \\{i, j\\}$ must cover segments strictly between $2i-1$ and $2j-n$.\nThis implies that $i$ must be the smallest town in $S$ and $j$ must be the largest town in $S$.\nSo $i=i_1$ and $j=i_k$.\n\nThis problem has a known structure related to \"perfect matchings\" on a line or specific combinatorial sequences.\nThe condition \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\" can be rephrased as follows:\nEach town $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ is \"owned\" by exactly one tower $i \\in S$. The towns owned by $i$ form a contiguous segment $[L_i, R_i]$ of length $2p_i-1$, where $i = (L_i+R_i)/2$.\nThis implies $L_i+R_i = 2i$.\nThe entire range $[1, n]$ must be partitioned into segments $[L_i, R_i]$ for $i \\in S$.\nSo, $L_1=1$, $R_k=n$, and $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$.\nSumming $R_j - L_j + 1 = 2p_j-1$ over all $j \\in S$: $\\sum_{j \\in S} (2p_j-1) = n$.\n\nConsider the sequence of towns $1, \\dots, n$.\nA tower at $i$ with power $p_i$ covers $i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1$.\nThe key observation for this type of problem is that the set of towns $S$ where towers are built must be a specific type of configuration.\nIf town $k$ is covered by tower $i$, then $i-p_i+1 \\le k \\le i+p_i-1$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ means that $i-p_i+1 \\ge 1$ and $i+p_i-1 \\le n$.\n\nLet's look at the structure of $S$.\nIf $k \\in S$ and $k+1 \\in S$, can we assign powers?\nIf $k \\in S$ and $k+1 \\in S$, and $p_k=1, p_{k+1}=1$, they cover $k$ and $k+1$ respectively.\nIf $k \\in S$ and $k+2 \\in S$, but $k+1 \\notin S$.\nThis means town $k+1$ must be covered by either tower $k$ or tower $k+2$.\nIf $k+1$ is covered by tower $k$, then $p_k \\ge 2$. Its range is $[k-p_k+1, k+p_k-1]$.\nIf $k+1$ is covered by tower $k+2$, then $p_{k+2} \\ge 2$. Its range is $[k+2-p_{k+2}+1, k+2+p_{k+2}-1]$.\nIf $k+1$ is covered by tower $k$, then $k+1 \\in [k-p_k+1, k+p_k-1]$.\nIf $k+1$ is covered by tower $k+2$, then $k+1 \\in [k+2-p_{k+2}+1, k+2+p_{k+2}-1]$.\nBut towns $k$ and $k+2$ must cover $k$ and $k+2$ respectively.\nIf $k+1$ is covered by $k$, then $k+1$ is $k$'s right neighbor.\nIf $k+1$ is covered by $k+2$, then $k+1$ is $k+2$'s left neighbor.\nThis implies that if $k+1 \\notin S$, then $k \\in S$ and $k+2 \\in S$ must exist, and $k+1$ is the \"junction point\" where tower $k$ covers up to $k+1$ and tower $k+2$ covers from $k+1$.\nThis means $R_k = k+1$ and $L_{k+2} = k+1$.\nSo $k+1 = k+p_k-1 \\implies p_k=2$.\nAnd $k+1 = (k+2)-p_{k+2}+1 \\implies p_{k+2}=2$.\nSo, if $k+1 \\notin S$, then $k \\in S$ and $k+2 \\in S$ must hold, and $p_k=2, p_{k+2}=2$.\nThis means the segment $[k, k+1]$ is covered by tower $k$, and $[k+1, k+2]$ is covered by tower $k+2$.\nBut this means $k+1$ is covered by two towers, which is forbidden!\n\nThis implies that if $k+1 \\notin S$, then it must be covered by *one* of its neighbors.\nIf $k \\in S$ and $k+1 \\notin S$, then $k+1$ must be covered by tower $k$ or by some tower $j > k+1$.\nIf $k+1$ is covered by tower $k$, then $p_k \\ge 2$.\nIf $k+1$ is covered by tower $j > k+1$, then $j-p_j+1 \\le k+1 \\le j+p_j-1$.\nThis also means that the configuration of towers must be such that there are no \"gaps\" of length greater than 1.\nSpecifically, if $i \\in S$ and $j \\in S$ are two towers, and there are no towers between $i$ and $j$ (i.e., $S \\cap \\{i+1, \\dots, j-1\\} = \\emptyset$), then the towns $i+1, \\dots, j-1$ must be covered.\nThese towns must be covered by either tower $i$ or tower $j$.\nIf $i+1, \\dots, j-1$ are covered by tower $i$, then $j-1 \\le i+p_i-1 \\implies p_i \\ge j-i$.\nIf $i+1, \\dots, j-1$ are covered by tower $j$, then $i+1 \\ge j-p_j+1 \\implies p_j \\ge j-i$.\nFor the \"exactly one\" condition, the range $[i+1, j-1]$ must be split between tower $i$ and tower $j$.\nThis means there is some town $m$ such that tower $i$ covers $[i-p_i+1, m]$ and tower $j$ covers $[m+1, j+p_j-1]$.\nThis means $m = i+p_i-1$ and $m+1 = j-p_j+1$.\nSo $i+p_i-1 = j-p_j$.\nThis is a crucial condition. $p_i+p_j = j-i+1$.\nThe towns $i, i+1, \\dots, j$ must be covered.\nThe actual towns covered are $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ and $[j-p_j+1, j+p_j-1]$.\nThe union must be $[i-p_i+1, j+p_j-1]$.\nThe segment of towns $i+1, \\dots, j-1$ must be covered.\nThe total length of towns covered by $i$ and $j$ is $(2p_i-1) + (2p_j-1)$.\nThe length of the combined segment $[i-p_i+1, j+p_j-1]$ is $(j+p_j-1) - (i-p_i+1) + 1 = j-i+p_i+p_j-1$.\nFor these segments to be disjoint and cover the intermediate towns, the combined length must be the sum of individual lengths.\nThis means there are no overlaps and no gaps.\nThis implies $j-i+p_i+p_j-1 = (2p_i-1) + (2p_j-1)$.\n$j-i+p_i+p_j-1 = 2p_i+2p_j-2$.\n$j-i+1 = p_i+p_j$.\nThis is a standard condition for \"non-overlapping and gapless covering\" by two intervals centered at $i$ and $j$ that are distance $j-i$ apart.\nThis means that if we have a sequence of towers $i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k$ such that $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ and $i_{j+1} - i_j > 1$, then for each such pair, $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$.\nAlso, $p_{i_1}=i_1$ and $p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$.\nIf $i_{j+1}-i_j=1$, then $p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}=2$. Since $p_x \\ge 1$, this means $p_{i_j}=1$ and $p_{i_{j+1}}=1$.\n\nSo, the condition implies that for any $i \\in S$, $i+1 \\in S$ or ($i+1 \\notin S$ and $i+2 \\in S$).\nNo, this is wrong. The condition $p_i+p_j = j-i+1$ implies that the two segments meet exactly.\nThis means $i+p_i-1 = j-p_j$.\nSo, the set of towns $S$ must form a sequence where adjacent towers $i, j$ (meaning no towers between them) satisfy $p_i+p_j = j-i+1$.\nThe first tower $i_1$ must have $p_{i_1}=i_1$.\nThe last tower $i_k$ must have $p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$.\n\nLet's test this with $n=5$.\nThe example: $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$.\n$i_1=2, i_2=4, i_3=5$.\n$p_2=2$. This covers $[1,3]$.\n$p_4=1$. This covers $[4,4]$.\n$p_5=1$. This covers $[5,5]$.\nUnion is $[1,3] \\cup [4,4] \\cup [5,5] = [1,5]$. This works.\nCheck conditions:\n$p_2=2 \\le \\min(2, 5+1-2=4) = 2$. OK.\n$p_4=1 \\le \\min(4, 5+1-4=2) = 1$. OK.\n$p_5=1 \\le \\min(5, 5+1-5=1) = 1$. OK.\n\nNow check $p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$.\nFor $i_1=2, i_2=4$: $p_2+p_4 = 2+1=3$. $i_2-i_1+1 = 4-2+1=3$. OK.\nFor $i_2=4, i_3=5$: $p_4+p_5 = 1+1=2$. $i_3-i_2+1 = 5-4+1=2$. OK.\n\nThis structure of towers is exactly what defines a \"Dyck path\" or similar combinatorial objects.\nThe condition $p_i+p_j = j-i+1$ implies that the sequence of towers must be such that if $i, j$ are adjacent towers in $S$, then $j-i$ must be an odd number (if $p_i, p_j$ are integers).\nNo, $p_i+p_j = j-i+1$ means $i+p_i-1 = j-p_j$.\nThis means the right endpoint of $i$'s segment is $j-p_j$.\nThe left endpoint of $j$'s segment is $j-p_j+1$.\nSo they are consecutive.\nThe total number of towns covered is $n$.\nEach tower $i$ covers a segment of length $2p_i-1$.\nThe sum of lengths is $\\sum (2p_i-1) = n$.\nThe sum of midpoints is $\\sum i$.\nThe sum of $p_i$ values is related to the sum of $j-i+1$ values.\n\nA condition for $p_i+p_j = j-i+1$ to hold for adjacent towers $i,j \\in S$ (and $p_{i_1}=i_1$, $p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$) is equivalent to:\nThe set $S$ must contain $1$ and $n$ OR $S$ must contain $k$ and $k+1$ for some $k$.\nThis is a known result for problems about covering a line segment with intervals.\nThe set of towns $S$ that can form a valid configuration must be such that:\n1. All $i \\in S$ have $1 \\le i \\le n$.\n2. For any $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, if $k \\notin S$, then $k-1 \\in S$ and $k+1 \\in S$.\nThis is incorrect. Example $n=5, S=\\{2,4,5\\}$. $3 \\notin S$, but $1 \\notin S$.\nThe condition is simpler:\nA configuration of towers $S$ allows for a valid assignment of powers if and only if for every $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, at least one of $k \\in S$ or $k+1 \\in S$ must hold.\nThis is because if $k \\notin S$ and $k+1 \\notin S$, then the \"gap\" $[k, k+1]$ cannot be covered by a single tower. A tower $i$ covering $k$ and $k+1$ would need $p_i \\ge 2$. If $i \\le k-1$, then $i+p_i-1 \\ge k+1$. If $i \\ge k+2$, then $i-p_i+1 \\le k$.\nIf $k \\notin S$ and $k+1 \\notin S$, then town $k$ must be covered by some tower $i \\in S$ where $i \\le k-1$. And town $k+1$ must be covered by some tower $j \\in S$ where $j \\ge k+2$.\nFor the \"exactly one\" condition, $i$ must cover up to $k$, and $j$ must cover from $k+1$.\nSo $i+p_i-1 = k$ and $j-p_j+1 = k+1$.\nThis means town $k$ is covered by tower $i$, and town $k+1$ is covered by tower $j$.\nThis is a valid partition.\nSo the condition is that there are no \"gaps\" of length 2 or more in the set of towns NOT having towers.\nI.e., there are no $k$ such that $k \\notin S$ and $k+1 \\notin S$.\nThis means that $S$ must be a sequence of consecutive blocks of towers, potentially separated by single towns without towers.\nE.g., $S = \\{1,2,3,5,7,8\\}$.\nThe towns without towers are $\\{4, 6\\}$.\n$4 \\notin S$, but $3 \\in S$ and $5 \\in S$.\n$6 \\notin S$, but $5 \\in S$ and $7 \\in S$.\nThis means that for every $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, either $k \\in S$ or $k+1 \\in S$.\nThis is equivalent to: the set of towns $S$ must not contain any two consecutive integers $k, k+1$ that are *both* missing from $S$.\nSo, if $i \\notin S$ and $i+1 \\notin S$ for any $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, then no valid assignment exists.\nWhy? If $i \\notin S$ and $i+1 \\notin S$:\nTown $i$ must be covered by some $j \\in S$. $j \\le i-1$.\nTown $i+1$ must be covered by some $k \\in S$. $k \\ge i+2$.\nFor the \"exactly one\" condition, the segment covered by $j$ must end at $i$, i.e., $j+p_j-1=i$.\nThe segment covered by $k$ must start at $i+1$, i.e., $k-p_k+1=i+1$.\nThis means $p_j = i-j+1$ and $p_k = k-i$.\nThese are valid assignments for $p_j$ and $p_k$.\nThis implies that the condition for a valid assignment is simply that $S$ must be non-empty and satisfy $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ for all $i \\in S$. The actual choices of $p_i$ are then fixed by the partition.\nThe true condition is that for every $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, at least one of $k \\in S$ or $k+1 \\in S$ must hold.\nThis is a known result for this problem. The set of \"bad\" configurations are those where there exists at least one $k$ such that town $k$ has no tower and town $k+1$ has no tower.\nIn other words, a valid assignment of powers exists if and only if there are no consecutive towns $k, k+1$ (for $1 \\le k \\le n-1$) where towers are *not* built.\n\nLet $A_k$ be the event that no tower is built in town $k$ AND no tower is built in town $k+1$.\nWe want to calculate the probability that none of these events $A_1, \\dots, A_{n-1}$ occur.\nThis is $P(\\text{NOT } A_1 \\text{ AND NOT } A_2 \\text{ AND } \\dots \\text{ AND NOT } A_{n-1})$.\nThis is the complement of $P(A_1 \\text{ OR } A_2 \\text{ OR } \\dots \\text{ OR } A_{n-1})$.\nBy inclusion-exclusion, this is $1 - P(\\bigcup A_k)$.\n$P(\\bigcup A_k) = \\sum P(A_k) - \\sum P(A_k \\cap A_j) + \\dots$\n\n$P(A_k)$ means town $k$ has no tower (prob $1/2$) AND town $k+1$ has no tower (prob $1/2$).\nSince tower choices are independent, $P(A_k) = (1/2) \\cdot (1/2) = 1/4$.\nThere are $n-1$ such events.\nThe total number of possible tower configurations is $2^n$.\nWe are looking for the number of configurations where there is no $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ such that towns $k$ and $k+1$ both have no towers.\nLet $dp[i]$ be the number of valid configurations for towns $1, \\dots, i$.\nThis is a standard dynamic programming problem.\nLet $f(i)$ be the number of valid configurations for towns $1, \\dots, i$.\nA configuration is valid if it does not contain $00$ (where $0$ means no tower, $1$ means tower).\nConsider town $i$.\nIf town $i$ has a tower (1): The configuration for $1, \\dots, i-1$ can be any valid configuration. So $f(i-1)$ ways.\nIf town $i$ has no tower (0): Then town $i-1$ MUST have a tower (1) to avoid $00$.\nSo, town $i-1$ must have a tower (1), and the configuration for $1, \\dots, i-2$ can be any valid configuration. So $f(i-2)$ ways.\nThus, $f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2)$. This is the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nBase cases:\nFor $n=1$: Towns $\\{1\\}$. No $k, k+1$ pair. Both configurations are valid.\n$S=\\{1\\}$ (tower at 1), $S=\\emptyset$ (no tower).\n$f(1)$ should be 2.\nFor $n=2$: Towns $\\{1,2\\}$.\n$S=\\{1,2\\}$ (11) - valid\n$S=\\{1\\}$ (10) - valid\n$S=\\{2\\}$ (01) - valid\n$S=\\emptyset$ (00) - invalid\n$f(2)$ should be 3.\n\nLet's define $f(0)=1$ (empty sequence, valid).\n$f(1)$:\n- $1$: $f(0)=1$ way.\n- $0$: $f(-1)$? No.\nLet $f[i]$ be the number of valid sequences of length $i$.\n$f[i]$: the $i$-th town is either $1$ or $0$.\nIf $i$-th town is $1$: the first $i-1$ towns can be any valid sequence. There are $f[i-1]$ ways.\nIf $i$-th town is $0$: the $(i-1)$-th town must be $1$. The first $i-2$ towns can be any valid sequence. There are $f[i-2]$ ways.\nSo $f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]$.\n\nBase cases:\n$f[0] = 1$ (empty sequence, no $00$ pairs).\n$f[1]$:\n- $1$: valid.\n- $0$: valid.\nSo $f[1] = 2$.\n\nUsing $f[0]=1, f[1]=2$:\n$f[2] = f[1]+f[0] = 2+1=3$. (Correct for $n=2$)\n$f[3] = f[2]+f[1] = 3+2=5$.\n$f[4] = f[3]+f[2] = 5+3=8$.\n$f[5] = f[4]+f[3] = 8+5=13$.\n\nThese are Fibonacci numbers shifted.\nLet $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13$.\nThen $f[i] = F_{i+2}$.\nSo the number of valid configurations is $F_{n+2}$.\n\nThe total number of configurations is $2^n$.\nThe probability is $F_{n+2} / 2^n$.\nWe need to calculate this modulo $998244353$.\nWe need $F_{n+2} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's check the examples.\n$n=2$: $F_{2+2} = F_4 = 3$. Total $2^2=4$. Probability $3/4$.\nExample output: $748683265$.\n$3 \\cdot 4^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$4^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$. $998244353 = 4 \\cdot 249561088 + 1$. So $4^{-1} = 249561089$.\n$3 \\cdot 249561089 = 748683267 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWait, example output is $748683265$. My calculation is $748683267$.\nWhat's wrong?\nAh, the problem states: \"The real answer for the first example is $\\frac{1}{4}$\".\nThis means my logic for the condition is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-read the example for $n=2$:\n\"with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$, the towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\"\nThis means only $S=\\{1,2\\}$ is valid for $n=2$. My $f[2]$ was 3.\nThe \"bad\" configuration $S=\\emptyset$ (00) is indeed invalid by my current logic.\nThe configurations $S=\\{1\\}$ (10) and $S=\\{2\\}$ (01) are considered valid by my DP.\nWhy would $S=\\{1\\}$ be invalid for $n=2$?\nTowns $0, \\dots, n+1$. For $n=2$, towns $0,1,2,3$.\nIf $S=\\{1\\}$: Tower at $1$.\n$p_1 \\le \\min(1, 2+1-1=2) = 1$. So $p_1=1$.\nTower $1$ with $p_1=1$ covers only town $1$.\nTown $0$ is not covered. Town $3$ is not covered.\nTown $1$ is covered by tower $1$.\nTown $2$ is NOT covered by any tower.\nThis violates the condition \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\".\nSo $S=\\{1\\}$ is invalid.\nSimilarly, $S=\\{2\\}$ is invalid for $n=2$. Tower at $2$ with $p_2=1$ covers only town $2$. Town $1$ is not covered.\n\nSo the Fibonacci recurrence is for a different problem.\nThe condition \"for every $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, at least one of $k \\in S$ or $k+1 \\in S$ must hold\" is a necessary condition, but not sufficient.\nThe additional condition is that all towns $1, \\dots, n$ must be covered.\nThis implies that $S$ cannot be empty.\nAlso, if $S=\\{1\\}$, town $2$ is not covered. If $S=\\{n\\}$, town $n-1$ is not covered.\nSo $S$ cannot be $\\{1\\}$ or $\\{n\\}$ for $n>1$. (For $n=1$, $S=\\{1\\}$ covers town $1$, so it is valid).\n\nLet's reconsider the example $n=5, S=\\{2,4,5\\}$.\n$p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1$.\nCovers: $[1,3], [4,4], [5,5]$. All towns $1, \\dots, 5$ covered.\n$S=\\{2,4,5\\}$. Towns without towers: $\\{1,3\\}$.\n- $1 \\notin S$. $2 \\in S$. So $(1,2)$ is not $00$.\n- $3 \\notin S$. $2 \\in S$ and $4 \\in S$. So $(2,3)$ is not $00$. $(3,4)$ is not $00$.\nThis configuration satisfies the \"no consecutive gaps\" rule.\n\nThe actual condition for a valid configuration $S$ is:\nThere exist $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, \\min(i, n+1-i)\\}$ for each $i \\in S$ such that:\n1. $\\bigcup_{i \\in S} [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1] = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n2. The intervals $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ are pairwise disjoint.\n\nThis is a known problem related to \"perfect matchings\" or \"domino tilings\".\nThe problem states: \"towns $1, 2, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\".\nThis implies that the whole segment $[1, n]$ must be partitioned by the ranges of the towers.\nLet $S = \\{t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k\\}$ be the towns with towers, sorted $t_1 < t_2 < \\dots < t_k$.\nThe covered ranges are $[t_j-p_{t_j}+1, t_j+p_{t_j}-1]$.\nFor a valid partition, we must have:\n$t_1-p_{t_1}+1 = 1 \\implies p_{t_1}=t_1$.\n$t_k+p_{t_k}-1 = n \\implies p_{t_k}=n+1-t_k$.\nFor $1 \\le j < k$, $t_j+p_{t_j}-1 = t_{j+1}-p_{t_{j+1}}$. This means $p_{t_j}+p_{t_{j+1}} = t_{j+1}-t_j+1$.\nAnd for all $j$, $p_{t_j} \\le \\min(t_j, n+1-t_j)$. This is automatically satisfied for $t_1$ and $t_k$ by their definitions ($p_{t_1}=t_1 \\le n+1-t_1 \\implies 2t_1 \\le n+1$ and $p_{t_k}=n+1-t_k \\le t_k \\implies n+1 \\le 2t_k$).\nFor intermediate towers $t_j$, $p_{t_j} \\le t_j$ and $p_{t_j} \\le n+1-t_j$.\nThe condition $p_{t_j}+p_{t_{j+1}} = t_{j+1}-t_j+1$ means that the $p_t$ values are uniquely determined by $S$.\n$p_{t_1} = t_1$.\n$p_{t_2} = t_2-t_1+1 - p_{t_1} = t_2-t_1+1 - t_1 = t_2-2t_1+1$.\n$p_{t_3} = t_3-t_2+1 - p_{t_2} = t_3-t_2+1 - (t_2-2t_1+1) = t_3-2t_2+2t_1$.\nIn general, $p_{t_j}$ is determined by $t_1, \\dots, t_j$.\nAlso $p_{t_k}$ is determined by $t_k, \\dots, t_j$.\nThe condition $p_{t_j}+p_{t_{j+1}} = t_{j+1}-t_j+1$ can be rewritten as $t_j+p_{t_j} = t_{j+1}-p_{t_{j+1}}+1$.\nLet $x_j = t_j-p_{t_j}+1$ and $y_j = t_j+p_{t_j}-1$.\nThen $y_j = x_{j+1}-1$.\nThis means $y_j+1 = x_{j+1}$.\nThe sequence of towns $t_1, \\dots, t_k$ must satisfy:\n$t_1-p_{t_1}+1 = 1 \\implies t_1-t_1+1=1$.\n$t_j+p_{t_j}-1 = t_{j+1}-p_{t_{j+1}} \\implies t_j+p_{t_j} = t_{j+1}-p_{t_{j+1}}+1$.\n$t_k+p_{t_k}-1 = n$.\n\nLet $d_j = t_{j+1}-t_j$.\n$p_{t_j}+p_{t_{j+1}} = d_j+1$.\nThis means $p_{t_j}$ and $p_{t_{j+1}}$ are \"linked\".\n$p_{t_1}=t_1$.\n$p_{t_2}=d_1+1-p_{t_1}$.\n$p_{t_3}=d_2+1-p_{t_2}$.\n...\n$p_{t_k}=d_{k-1}+1-p_{t_{k-1}}$.\nAlso $p_{t_k}=n+1-t_k$.\nSo $n+1-t_k = d_{k-1}+1-p_{t_{k-1}}$.\n$n+1-t_k = (t_k-t_{k-1})+1 - p_{t_{k-1}}$.\n$p_{t_{k-1}} = t_k-t_{k-1}+1 - (n+1-t_k) = 2t_k-t_{k-1}-n$.\n\nThe condition $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ must hold for all $i \\in S$.\nThis means $p_{t_j} \\ge 1$ for all $j$.\nAnd $p_{t_j} \\le t_j$ and $p_{t_j} \\le n+1-t_j$.\nThe conditions $p_{t_1}=t_1$ and $p_{t_k}=n+1-t_k$ already ensure $p_{t_1} \\ge 1$ and $p_{t_k} \\ge 1$.\nThe additional constraint is $2t_1 \\le n+1$ and $n+1 \\le 2t_k$.\nAlso, $p_{t_j} \\ge 1 \\iff p_{t_{j+1}} \\le d_j$.\n$p_{t_j} \\le t_j \\iff p_{t_{j+1}} \\ge d_j+1-t_j$.\n$p_{t_j} \\le n+1-t_j \\iff p_{t_{j+1}} \\ge d_j+1-(n+1-t_j)$.\n\nThis is a specific type of configuration.\nConsider the sequence $t_1, \\dots, t_k$.\nThe values $p_{t_j}$ are uniquely determined by $t_1, \\dots, t_k$ and $n$.\n$p_{t_j} = \\sum_{m=1}^j (-1)^{j-m} (t_m - t_{m-1} + 1)$ where $t_0=0$.\n$p_{t_j} = t_j - 2t_{j-1} + 2t_{j-2} - \\dots + (-1)^{j-1} 2t_1 + (-1)^j$. (This is not quite right)\n$p_{t_j} = t_j - \\sum_{m=1}^{j-1} (-1)^{j-m} 2t_m + (-1)^{j-1} t_1$.\n\nLet's use a simpler formulation.\nA valid configuration $S$ means that we can tile the interval $[1, n]$ with segments $[t-p_t+1, t+p_t-1]$.\nThis is equivalent to: $S$ must be non-empty. For $n=1$, $S=\\{1\\}$ is valid.\nFor $n=2$:\n$S=\\{1,2\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$. Covers $[1,1]$ and $[2,2]$. Valid.\n$S=\\{1\\}$. Covers $[1,1]$. $2$ is not covered. Invalid.\n$S=\\{2\\}$.

This is invalid.\nSo the configurations must be non-empty.\n\nThe recurrence $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ counts sequences of $0$s and $1$s of length $n$ that do not contain '00'.\n$F_1=2$ (0, 1)\n$F_2=3$ (01, 10, 11)\n$F_3=5$ (010, 011, 101, 110, 111)\n\nThe condition \"at least one of $k \\in S$ or $k+1 \\in S$ must hold\" means no '00' substring.\nAnd \"Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\" means $S \\ne \\emptyset$.\nAlso, $1 \\in S$ or $p_i=i$ for some $i>1$ (which means $1$ is covered by $i$).\nAnd $n \\in S$ or $p_i=n+1-i$ for some $i<n$ (which means $n$ is covered by $i$).\n\nThe standard interpretation of \"tiling a $1 \\times n$ board with $1 \\times 1$ and $1 \\times 2$ blocks\" is that $1 \\times 1$ block corresponds to a tower at $i$ with $p_i=1$, and $1 \\times 2$ block corresponds to a tower at $i$ with $p_i=2$ covering $i-1, i, i+1$.\nNo, the $1 \\times 1$ block is $i \\in S, p_i=1$.\nThe $1 \\times 2$ block corresponds to $i \\notin S, i+1 \\notin S$.\nA $1 \\times k$ block corresponds to $p_i = \\lceil k/2 \\rceil$? No.\n\nLet's use the definition from a known source for this problem.\nThe problem is equivalent to counting configurations $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that the interval $[1, n]$ can be partitioned into segments $[L_j, R_j]$ where each $L_j, R_j$ corresponds to a unique $t_j \\in S$ such that $t_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\nThe number of such configurations $S$ is $F_{n+1}$. This is the standard answer.\nWhy does the example $n=2$ say $1/4$? My $F_3=2$ gives $2/4$.\nThe example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$.\n$1/4 = 249561089 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$2/4 = 499122178 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThe example output for $n=2$ is $3/4$, not $1/4$.\n$3/4 = 748683267 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nOkay, the example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$. This is neither $1/4$ nor $2/4$ nor $3/4$.\nIt seems the example output provided in the problem description is wrong for $n=2$.\n$748683265 \\pmod{998244353}$ is $748683265$.\n$1/4 \\pmod{998244353} = 249561089$.\n$3/4 \\pmod{998244353} = 748683267$.\nThe example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$. This is not $1/4$ or $3/4$.\nThis is very confusing. Let me check the provided example outputs.\nInput: `2`\nOutput: `748683265`\nInput: `3`\nOutput: `748683265`\nInput: `5`\nOutput: `842268673`\nInput: `200000`\nOutput: `202370013`\n\nMy calculation for $n=2$: $F_3=2$. Probability $2/4=1/2$.\n$1/2 \\pmod{998244353} = 499122177$.\nThis is not $748683265$.\n\nMy calculation for $n=3$: $F_4=3$. Probability $3/8$.\n$3/8 \\pmod{998244353}$. $8^{-1} = 124780544 + 1/8$. $8^{-1} = 124780544 \\cdot 8 + 1 = 998244352+1$.\n$8^{-1} = 124780544 \\times 1 = 124780544$. No, $8^{-1} = (MOD+1)/8 = (998244353+1)/8 = 998244354/8 = 124780544.25$.\n$8^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$. $998244353 = 8 \\cdot 124780544 + 1$. So $8^{-1} = 124780544 \\cdot (-1) \\pmod{998244353} = 998244353 - 124780544 = 873463809$.\n$3 \\cdot 873463809 = 2620391427 \\pmod{998244353} = 2620391427 - 2 \\cdot 998244353 = 2620391427 - 1996488706 = 623902721$.\nSo for $n=3$, my answer is $623902721$. Example output is $748683265$.\n\nThe example outputs are inconsistent with the problem statement or my understanding.\nLet me check the note: \"The real answer for the first example is $\\frac{1}{4}$\". This refers to $n=2$.\nSo for $n=2$, the answer is $1/4$.\nThis means only $S=\\{1,2\\}$ is valid.\nMy logic gives $S=\\{1,2\\}$ and $S=\\{2\\}$ and $S=\\{1\\}$ and $S=\\emptyset$ for $n=2$.\nOh, I misunderstood the examples.\nThe example has input `2`, then `3`, then `5`, then `200000`.\nFor input `2`, output is `748683265`.\nFor input `3`, output is `748683265`.\nFor input `5`, output is `842268673`.\nFor input `200000`, output is `202370013`.\n\nThe note says \"The real answer for the first example is $\\frac{1}{4}$\". This means for $n=2$, the answer is $1/4$.\n$1/4 \\pmod{998244353} = 249561089$.\nBut the output for input `2` is `748683265`.\nThis is very confusing. Is `748683265` equal to $1/4$ modulo $998244353$? No.\nIs `748683265` equal to $3/4$ modulo $998244353$? Yes, $748683267$. Close, but not exactly.\nIt's possible the example output is wrong, or I'm missing something fundamental.\n\nLet's assume the example output $748683265$ for $n=2$ is correct.\nThis means $X/4 = 748683265 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$X = 748683265 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{998244353} = 2994733060 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$2994733060 = 3 \\cdot 998244353 + 0$.\nSo $X=3$.\nThis means the probability for $n=2$ is $3/4$.\nSo for $n=2$, there are 3 valid configurations.\nMy $F_{n+2}$ logic gave $F_4=3$. This matches $3/4$.\nMy $F_{n+1}$ logic gave $F_3=2$. This gave $2/4$.\n\nSo the number of valid configurations is $F_{n+2}$ (using $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\nThis means $f[0]=1, f[1]=2$.\n$f[n]$ is the number of valid configurations for $n$ towns.\n$f[n] = F_{n+2}$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_3=2$. Prob $2/2 = 1$.\nFor $n=2$, $F_4=3$. Prob $3/4$.\nFor $n=3$, $F_5=5$. Prob $5/8$.\nFor $n=5$, $F_7=13$. Prob $13/32$.\n\nLet's check $n=3$ with $F_{n+2}$ logic.\n$F_5=5$. Probability $5/8$.\n$5/8 \\pmod{998244353} = 5 \\cdot 873463809 = 4367319045 \\pmod{998244353} = 4367319045 - 4 \\cdot 998244353 = 4367319045 - 3992977412 = 374341633$.\nExample output for $n=3$ is $748683265$.\nThis is not $374341633$.\n\nThis implies that the two example values $748683265$ for $n=2$ and $n=3$ are just some random values, or they refer to something else.\nThe note clearly states \"The real answer for the first example is $\\frac{1}{4}$\".\nFirst example is $n=2$. So for $n=2$, the answer is $1/4$.\n$1/4 \\pmod{998244353} = 249561089$.\nThis is the value I should be getting for $n=2$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the configurations for $n=2$.\nTowns $0,1,2,3$. Towers in $1,2$.\n$S=\\{1,2\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$. Covers $[1,1],[2,2]$. Valid.\n$S=\\{1\\}$. $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. Town $2$ not covered. Invalid.\n$S=\\{2\\}$. $p_2=1$. Covers $[2,2]$. Town $1$ not covered. Invalid.\n$S=\\emptyset$. No towns covered. Invalid.\nSo for $n=2$, only $S=\\{1,2\\}$ is valid. This is 1 configuration.\nTotal $2^2=4$ configurations. Probability $1/4$.\nThis matches the *note* about $n=2$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate for $n=3$.\nTowns $0,1,2,3,4$. Towers in $1,2,3$.\nTotal $2^3=8$ configurations.\n1. $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$. Covers $[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]$. Valid.\n2. $S=\\{2\\}$. $p_2=2$. Covers $[1,3]$. Valid.\n3. $S=\\{1,3\\}$. $p_1=1, p_3=1$. Covers $[1,1],[3,3]$. Town $2$ not covered. Invalid.\n4. $S=\\{1,2\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$. Covers $[1,1],[2,2]$. Town $3$ not covered. Invalid.\n5. $S=\\{2,3\\}$. $p_2=1, p_3=1$. Covers $[2,2],[3,3]$. Town $1$ not covered. Invalid.\n6. $S=\\{1\\}$. Town $2,3$ not covered. Invalid.\n7. $S=\\{3\\}$. Town $1,2$ not covered. Invalid.\n8. $S=\\emptyset$. Invalid.\nSo for $n=3$, there are 2 valid configurations. Probability $2/8=1/4$.\nThe note for $n=3$ says: \"The real answer for the second example is $\\frac{1}{4}$\".\nSo for $n=3$, the answer is $1/4$.\n$1/4 \\pmod{998244353} = 249561089$.\n\nSo for $n=2$, $1/4$.\nFor $n=3$, $1/4$.\nFor $n=5$, the note says $5/32$.\nMy manual count for $n=5$ yielded 5 valid configurations. Probability $5/32$. This matches.\n\nSo the sequence of valid configurations count is $1, 2, 5, \\dots$ for $n=2,3,5$.\n$N=1$: $S=\\{1\\}$. $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. Valid. Count=1. Prob $1/2$.\n$N=2$: $S=\\{1,2\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$. Covers $[1,1],[2,2]$. Valid. Count=1. Prob $1/4$.\n$N=3$: $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$ ($p_i=1$). $S=\\{2\\}$ ($p_2=2$). Valid. Count=2. Prob $2/8=1/4$.\n$N=4$: $S=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ ($p_i=1$). $S=\\{1,3\\}$ ($p_1=1, p_3=2$). $S=\\{2,4\\}$ ($p_2=2, p_4=1$). Valid. Count=3. Prob $3/16$.\n$N=5$: $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ ($p_i=1$). $S=\\{1,2,4\\}$ ($p_1=1, p_2=1, p_4=2$). $S=\\{2,3,5\\}$ ($p_2=2, p_3=1, p_5=1$). $S=\\{1,3,5\\}$ ($p_1=1, p_3=3, p_5=1$). $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$ ($p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1$). $S=\\{3\\}$ ($p_3=3$). Valid. Count=5. Prob $5/32$.\n\nThe sequence of valid counts is $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$ for $n=1,2,3,4,5$.\nThis is $F_n$ where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5$.\nSo the number of valid configurations is $F_n$.\nThis is $F_n$ using $F_1=1, F_2=1$.\nSo we need to calculate $F_n \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Calculate $F_n \\pmod{MOD}$.\n   Initialize $a=1, b=1$ (representing $F_1, F_2$).\n   If $n=1$, $F_1=1$, so result is $a$.\n   If $n=0$, $F_0=0$. (But $n \\ge 1$)\n   Loop $n-2$ times (from $i=3$ to $n$):\n     $c = (a+b) \\pmod{MOD}$\n     $a = b$\n     $b = c$\n   After loop, $b$ will hold $F_n$.\n   If $n=1$, loop $1-2 = -1$ times. $b$ holds $F_2=1$. This should be $F_1=1$.\n   Adjust base cases for $F_n$:\n   If $n=1$, result is $1$.\n   If $n=2$, result is $1$.\n   If $n \\ge 3$:\n     $a=1, b=1$ (for $F_1, F_2$)\n     Loop $i$ from $3$ to $n$:\n       $c = (a+b) \\pmod{MOD}$\n       $a = b$\n       $b = c$\n     Result is $b$.\n\n2. Calculate $inv\\_2n = \\text{pow}(2, n, MOD)$.\n   Then $inv\\_2n = \\text{pow}(inv\\_2n, MOD-2, MOD)$.\n\n3. Result is $(F_n \\cdot inv\\_2n) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n\nLet's test this logic:\n$n=1$: $F_1=1$. $1 \\cdot (2^1)^{-1} = 1/2$.\n$n=2$: $F_2=1$. $1 \\cdot (2^2)^{-1} = 1/4$.\n$n=3$: $F_3=2$. $2 \\cdot (2^3)^{-1} = 2/8 = 1/4$.\n$n=5$: $F_5=5$. $5 \\cdot (2^5)^{-1} = 5/32$.\n\nThese match all the probabilities given in the problem note.\nThis means the Fibonacci sequence $F_n$ (with $F_1=1, F_2=1$) is the correct number of valid configurations.\nThe example outputs in the input/output section are still confusingly different from the note, but the note takes precedence.\n\nModulo is $998244353$.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Handle $n=1$ and $n=2$ explicitly for the Fibonacci calculation or make the loop work.\n  If $n=1$, $F_1=1$.\n  If $n=2$, $F_2=1$.\n  For $n \\ge 3$:\n    `a = 1` (for $F_1$)\n    `b = 1` (for $F_2$)\n    `for _ in range(3, n + 1):`\n      `c = (a + b) % MOD`\n      `a = b`\n      `b = c`\n    `fib_n = b`\n\n  A more robust way for $F_n$:\n  `if n == 1: fib_n = 1`\n  `elif n == 2: fib_n = 1`\n  `else:`\n    `a, b = 1, 1` # F_1, F_2\n    `for _ in range(n - 2):` # n-2 iterations to get to F_n\n      `a, b = b, (a + b) % MOD`\n    `fib_n = b`\n\n  This is correct.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef inv(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n == 1:\n        fib_n = 1\n    elif n == 2:\n        fib_n = 1\n    else:\n        # Calculate F_n where F_1=1, F_2=1\n        a, b = 1, 1  # Represents F_1, F_2\n        for _ in range(n - 2):\n            a, b = b, (a + b) % MOD\n        fib_n = b\n\n    # Calculate (2^n)^-1 mod MOD\n    # First, calculate 2^n mod MOD\n    pow2_n = power(2, n)\n    # Then, calculate its modular inverse\n    inv_pow2_n = inv(pow2_n)\n\n    # The probability is F_n * (2^n)^-1 mod MOD\n    result = (fib_n * inv_pow2_n) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
