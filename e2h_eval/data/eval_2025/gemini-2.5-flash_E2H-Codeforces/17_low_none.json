He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Prefix-Suffix Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem. It's about reconstructing a hidden string, `s`, based on a scrambled list of its prefixes and suffixes.  The input gives me `n`, the length of `s`, and then `2n-2` strings – every possible prefix and suffix *except* the full string itself.  My goal is to figure out, for each of those shorter strings, whether it's a prefix or a suffix and output a sequence of 'P's and 'S's to represent that.\n\nMy first thought is, \"How can I untangle this mess?\"  I need a strategy, and here's what I've figured out:\n\n*   **Length is Key:**  The problem practically screams \"look at lengths!\"  For any length `k` (from 1 up to `n-1`), I'm *guaranteed* to find exactly one prefix and one suffix of that length in the input.  That's my starting point.\n\n*   **Finding the Big Pieces:**  The real trick lies in the prefixes and suffixes of length `n-1`. If I can identify the prefix of length `n-1` (let's call it `P_n-1`) and the suffix of length `n-1` (let's call it `S_n-1`), I'm golden. Knowing these two gives me crucial information.\n\n*   **Piecing it Together:**  Here's where it gets interesting.  If `P_n-1` is `s[0...n-2]` and `S_n-1` is `s[1...n-1]`, I can form the original string `s`. The string `s` can be formed by concatenating `P_n-1` with the last character of `s` which is  `s_{n-1}` and also can be formed by concatenating the first character of `s` which is `s_0` and  `S_n-1`. Then, `s_0` must be the same as the first character of `P_n-1` and `s_{n-1}` must be the same as the last character of `S_n-1` (using 0-based indexing)\n\n*   **The Algorithm:** So, I need to go through the input, find those `n-1` length strings, verify that the first characters match and the last characters match. Then, I can assign 'P' or 'S' to the other shorter strings by comparing the first and last characters of `P_n-1` and `S_n-1` and reconstruct the original string.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine, for each of the `2n-2` given strings, whether it is a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') of an unknown original string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings for each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, and that these strings are indeed the prefixes and suffixes of some valid `s`.\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nThe crucial insight lies in the two strings of length `n-1`. Let these be `str1` and `str2`.\nOne of them must be `s[0...n-2]` (the prefix of length `n-1`), and the other must be `s[1...n-1]` (the suffix of length `n-1`).\n\nLet's assume `str1` is `s[0...n-2]` and `str2` is `s[1...n-1]`.\nFrom these two strings, we can reconstruct the full string `s`:\n`s = str1[0] + str2` (if `str1[0]` is the first character `s[0]`, and `str2` is `s[1...n-1]`)\n`s = str1 + str2[n-2]` (if `str1` is `s[0...n-2]`, and `str2[n-2]` is the last character `s[n-1]` -- this indexing is `str2[n-1 - 1]`)\n\nMore precisely, if `str1 = s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-2}` and `str2 = s_1 s_2 ... s_{n-1}`:\n1.  The string `s` can be formed by `str1 + str2[n-2]` (where `str2[n-2]` is the last character of `str2`).\n2.  Also, `str1[1...n-2]` must be equal to `str2[0...n-3]`. This is the common substring `s_1 ... s_{n-2}`.\n    *   `str1[1:]` (suffix of `str1` of length `n-2`) must be equal to `str2[:-1]` (prefix of `str2` of length `n-2`).\n\nThis gives us a condition to check if a pair (`str1`, `str2`) can be the (prefix, suffix) of length `n-1`:\n`str1[1:] == str2[:-1]`\n\nThere are two possibilities for the pair of strings of length `n-1`:\n**Case 1:**\n*   `str1` is the prefix `s[0...n-2]`.\n*   `str2` is the suffix `s[1...n-1]`.\n*   This implies `str1[1:] == str2[:-1]`.\n*   If this condition holds, the reconstructed string `s` would be `str1 + str2[n-2]` (or `str1[0] + str2`).\n\n**Case 2:**\n*   `str2` is the prefix `s[0...n-2]`.\n*   `str1` is the suffix `s[1...n-1]`.\n*   This implies `str2[1:] == str1[:-1]`.\n*   If this condition holds, the reconstructed string `s` would be `str2 + str1[n-2]` (or `str2[0] + str1`).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Store all `2n-2` input strings, preserving their original order.\n3.  Identify the two strings of length `n-1`. Let them be `cand1` and `cand2`.\n4.  **Attempt 1:** Assume `cand1` is the prefix of length `n-1` and `cand2` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\n    *   Check if `cand1[1:] == cand2[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, construct a candidate string `s_candidate = cand1 + cand2[n-2]`.\n    *   Validate `s_candidate`:\n        *   Generate all prefixes of `s_candidate` (lengths 1 to `n-1`).\n        *   Generate all suffixes of `s_candidate` (lengths 1 to `n-1`).\n        *   Count occurrences of each string in the input list. For a valid `s_candidate`, each generated prefix/suffix must appear exactly once in the input list.\n        *   If `s_candidate` is valid, we found a solution. Record the assignments: `cand1` is 'P', `cand2` is 'S'. Then iterate through the original input strings. For each string `x`, if `x` is a prefix of `s_candidate`, assign 'P'; otherwise, assign 'S'. Print the result and exit.\n5.  **Attempt 2:** If Attempt 1 failed, assume `cand2` is the prefix of length `n-1` and `cand1` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\n    *   Check if `cand2[1:] == cand1[:-1]`.\n    *   If true, construct a candidate string `s_candidate = cand2 + cand1[n-2]`.\n    *   Validate `s_candidate` using the same method as in Attempt 1.\n    *   If `s_candidate` is valid, record assignments: `cand2` is 'P', `cand1` is 'S'. Then iterate through the original input strings. For each string `x`, if `x` is a prefix of `s_candidate`, assign 'P'; otherwise, assign 'S'. Print the result and exit.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\n*   The problem guarantees that a valid `s` exists.\n*   The two strings of length `n-1` *must* correspond to `s[0...n-2]` and `s[1...n-1]` in some order.\n*   The condition `P[1:] == S[:-1]` correctly identifies which string is the prefix and which is the suffix among the two length `n-1` strings.\n*   Once `s` is uniquely determined, all its prefixes and suffixes are also uniquely determined. We can then simply check if each input string is a prefix or a suffix of the *reconstructed* `s`.\n*   Since there are exactly two strings of each length `k`, one will be a prefix and one a suffix.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n\n`n = 5`\nInput strings: `ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba`\n\n1.  Strings of length `n-1 = 4`: `abab`, `baba`. Let `cand1 = \"abab\"`, `cand2 = \"baba\"`.\n\n2.  **Attempt 1:** Assume `cand1` (`\"abab\"`) is P, `cand2` (`\"baba\"`) is S.\n    *   Check `cand1[1:] == cand2[:-1]`:\n        *   `\"abab\"[1:]` is `\"bab\"`\n        *   `\"baba\"[:-1]` is `\"bab\"`\n        *   `\"bab\" == \"bab\"` is True.\n    *   Construct `s_candidate = cand1 + cand2[n-2] = \"abab\" + \"baba\"[3] = \"abab\" + \"a\" = \"ababa\"`.\n    *   Validate \"ababa\":\n        *   Prefixes: `a, ab, aba, abab`\n        *   Suffixes: `a, ba, aba, baba`\n        *   Let's count how many times each generated prefix/suffix appears in the input list.\n            *   `a`: appears 2 times (input: `a, a`)\n            *   `ab`: appears 1 time (input: `ab`)\n            *   `aba`: appears 2 times (input: `aba, aba`)\n            *   `abab`: appears 1 time (input: `abab`)\n            *   `ba`: appears 1 time (input: `ba`)\n            *   `baba`: appears 1 time (input: `baba`)\n        *   This seems correct. All required strings are present exactly once as a prefix and once as a suffix, across the lengths.\n    *   `s_candidate = \"ababa\"` is valid.\n    *   Now, classify input strings based on \"ababa\":\n        *   `ba`: S (`\"ababa\"`.endswith(`\"ba\"`))\n        *   `a`: S (`\"ababa\"`.endswith(`\"a\"`))\n        *   `abab`: P (`\"ababa\"`.startswith(`\"abab\"`))\n        *   `a`: P (`\"ababa\"`.startswith(`\"a\"`))\n        *   `aba`: S (`\"ababa\"`.endswith(`\"aba\"`))\n        *   `baba`: S (`\"ababa\"`.endswith(`\"baba\"`))\n        *   `ab`: P (`\"ababa\"`.startswith(`\"ab\"`))\n        *   `aba`: P (`\"ababa\"`.startswith(`\"aba\"`))\n    *   Result: `SPPSPSPS`.
