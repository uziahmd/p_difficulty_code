    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this competitive programming problem and my thought process for tackling it.** The core task is to find the smallest non-negative integer 'k' that minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a + k` and `b + k`. Essentially, we're trying to shift both 'a' and 'b' by the same amount 'k' and make their LCM as small as possible.\n\nMy initial thought was to represent `a + k` as 'x' and `b + k` as 'y'. The LCM of x and y can be calculated as `(x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.  The key insight, and where I started really focusing, was that the difference between x and y is a constant: `b - a`. This difference is crucial because the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y *must* be a divisor of `b - a`. This observation is the cornerstone of my strategy.\n\nSince we are trying to *minimize* the LCM, I figured we should look at different GCDs that are divisors of this difference, `b - a`. I needed to iterate through all the divisors of `diff = abs(b - a)`. The program starts by finding all the divisors using a function,  and it handles the cases for `a=b`.\n\nFor each divisor `g` (potential GCD), I aim to find the *smallest* `k` such that `a + k` is a multiple of `g`.  This means `a + k` is divisible by `g`, ensuring that `b + k` is also divisible by the same `g`. I realized that this 'k' can be computed using modular arithmetic, where `k = -a % g`.  Then I had to check that this solution produces a non-negative k.\n\nI then calculate the resulting LCM and keep track of the minimum LCM encountered so far and the corresponding `k` value. Since the prompt stated that in the case of equal LCMs, the *smallest* k should be selected. The program will also check for the special edge case where a and b are the same value.\n\nAt the end of this loop, `best_k` holds the smallest k that yields the minimal LCM, and that is what gets printed out as the solution!\n\nI've carefully considered the time complexity, which is dominated by the divisor finding, which is manageable, and the GCD calculation within the loop, which is also very fast.  Also, Python does not have any integer overflow issues. And finally, I've run several test cases and ensured that it produces the right results.  I am confident that the code will produce the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is minimized.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know the relationship `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\nAlso, `y - x = (b+k) - (a+k) = b - a`.\nA key property of the greatest common divisor (GCD) is that `gcd(x, y)` must divide `y - x`.\nTherefore, `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `b - a`.\n\nLet `diff = abs(b - a)`. If `a = b`, then `diff = 0`. In this case, `gcd(a+k, b+k) = gcd(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. The `lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize `a+k` for `k >= 0`, we must choose `k=0`. So, if `a=b`, the answer is `0`.\n\nFor `a != b`, `diff > 0`. The strategy is to iterate through all possible values for `g = gcd(a+k, b+k)`. Since `g` must be a divisor of `diff`, we can find all divisors of `diff` and consider each one as a potential `g`.\n\nFor each divisor `g` of `diff`:\n1. We need `a+k` to be a multiple of `g`. The smallest non-negative `k` that satisfies this condition is `k = (-a) % g`.\n   - If `a` is already a multiple of `g` (i.e., `a % g == 0`), then `k = 0`.\n   - Otherwise, `k = g - (a % g)`. Python's `%` operator correctly handles `(-a) % g` to produce `k` in the range `[0, g-1]`.\n2. Let this `k` be `k_candidate`.\n3. Calculate `x = a + k_candidate` and `y = b + k_candidate`.\n4. Calculate the actual GCD: `current_gcd = gcd(x, y)`. Note that `current_gcd` will be a multiple of `g` because `g` divides `x` and `g` divides `y` (since `g` divides `x` and `g` divides `b-a = y-x`).\n5. Calculate the LCM: `current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd`. To prevent potential intermediate overflow in languages like C++/Java, it's safer to compute `(x // current_gcd) * y`. Python handles arbitrary-sized integers, so `(x * y) // current_gcd` is also fine.\n6. Compare `current_lcm` with the minimum LCM found so far (`min_lcm_val`).\n   - If `current_lcm < min_lcm_val`, update `min_lcm_val = current_lcm` and `best_k = k_candidate`.\n   - If `current_lcm == min_lcm_val`, update `best_k = min(best_k, k_candidate)` to ensure we pick the smallest `k`.\n\nWe initialize `min_lcm_val` to infinity and `best_k` to `0`. It's good practice to explicitly calculate `lcm(a, b)` (i.e., for `k=0`) and use it as the initial `min_lcm_val` and `best_k=0`. This ensures `best_k` is `0` if `k=0` is indeed the optimal solution and provides a valid baseline.\n\nThe maximum values for `a, b` are `10^9`. So `diff` can be up to `10^9`. The number of divisors for a number up to `10^9` is relatively small (at most around 1344). For each divisor, we perform a GCD calculation (logarithmic time complexity) and constant time arithmetic operations. This approach is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\nExample walkthrough (6, 10):\n1. `a=6, b=10`. `a < b` is already true.\n2. `diff = b - a = 10 - 6 = 4`.\n3. Divisors of `4`: `[1, 2, 4]`.\n4. Initialize `min_lcm_val = lcm(6, 10) = 30`, `best_k = 0`.\n5. Iterate through divisors `g`:\n   - `g = 1`: `k_candidate = -6 % 1 = 0`. `x=6, y=10`. `gcd(6,10)=2`. `lcm=(6*10)//2 = 30`. `lcm == min_lcm_val`, `best_k = min(0,0) = 0`.\n   - `g = 2`: `k_candidate = -6 % 2 = 0`. `x=6, y=10`. `gcd(6,10)=2`. `lcm=(6*10)//2 = 30`. `lcm == min_lcm_val`, `best_k = min(0,0) = 0`.\n   - `g = 4`: `k_candidate = -6 % 4 = 2`. `x=6+2=8, y=10+2=12`. `gcd(8,12)=4`. `lcm=(8*12)//4 = 24`. `lcm < min_lcm_val`. Update `min_lcm_val = 24`, `best_k = 2`.\n6. Final `best_k = 2`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to get all divisors of a number\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divs = set()\n    # Iterate up to sqrt(n)\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # Handle the special case where a and b are equal\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Ensure a <= b for consistent calculation of diff\n    # The LCM is symmetric, so swapping doesn't change the result.\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    diff = b - a\n    \n    # Get all divisors of diff.
