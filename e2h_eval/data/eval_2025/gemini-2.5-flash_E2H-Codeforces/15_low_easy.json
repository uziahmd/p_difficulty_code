They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Strategic Approach to the \"Playoff\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to tackle this \"Playoff\" competitive programming challenge.  Let's break this down systematically, thinking like a programmer and an expert in algorithms.\n\nFirst, I recognize the core structure: we have a tournament with a power-of-two number of teams, each with a unique skill level represented by a permutation. The tournament's outcome depends on a string `s`, dictating whether the higher or lower skilled team wins each phase. My objective is to identify all \"winning integers,\" which are skill levels that *could* lead to a win for that team, given some favorable permutation `p`.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the tournament's evolution.  I immediately grasp the significance of `s`. It's not just random; it encodes the rules of each phase. A '0' means the underdog wins (lower skill beats higher), and a '1' means the favorite wins (higher skill triumphs).  This tells me that my solution will probably depend on how to create a winning permutation.\n\nI realize that to be the champion, a team must win *every* game. And, in each phase, the outcome is determined by the bit in `s`.  If I want a team with skill level X to win, it needs to satisfy the condition dictated by `s`.\n\nNow, I'm starting to think about ranges.  A team with skill X can win if `s` is set in such a way that the team is the underdog when `s` is 0 and the favorite when `s` is 1. This means, if `s` is 0, the skill level has to be low. If `s` is 1, the skill level has to be high.\n\nI'm formalizing this:  Let `c0` be the number of '0's in `s` and `c1` be the number of '1's. For a team with skill X to triumph, it must win `c0` matches where its opponent's skill is *greater* than X, and `c1` matches where its opponent's skill is *less* than X. This is where the permutation comes in. The winning team must be able to have higher skill or lower skill as required.\n\nEssentially, the strategy boils down to determining the possible skill levels given the string `s`.  We need to reason about a team's skill level relative to the entire set of teams. The number of games where we want a team to win against a higher or lower-skilled opponent will probably determine the range of winning integers. I feel that the ultimate solution will be finding a pattern or formula that translates `s` into a range of winning skill levels. I need to figure out what values of X can satisfy the condition I stated before. I need to think more about this.\n\nI'll start by thinking about smaller cases and try to generalize. Let's see how I can map the binary string 's' to winning integers! This is the core of the problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ such that a team with skill $x$ can win a playoff tournament, given a string $s$ that dictates game outcomes. The tournament involves $2^n$ teams with skill levels being a permutation of $1, \\dots, 2^n$. In phase $i$, if $s_i = '0'$, the team with lower skill wins; if $s_i = '1'$, the team with higher skill wins.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $X$ to win the tournament. A team must win $n$ games to become the champion.\nLet $c_0$ be the count of '0's in the string $s$, and $c_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$. So, $c_0 + c_1 = n$.\n\nIf a team with skill $X$ wins the tournament:\n1. It must win $c_0$ games where the rule is \"lower skill wins\". For $X$ to win such a game, its opponent must have skill $Y > X$.\n2. It must win $c_1$ games where the rule is \"higher skill wins\". For $X$ to win such a game, its opponent must have skill $Y < X$.\n\nConsider the set of all $2^n$ skill levels $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nFor a team with skill $X$ to win the tournament, we need to find a permutation $p$ of these skill levels such that $X$ emerges as the champion.\n\nLet's consider the opponents a team with skill $X$ might face.\n- To win a game where the lower skill wins ($s_i = '0'$), $X$ must be lower than its opponent. The smallest possible skill for an opponent greater than $X$ is $X+1$.\n- To win a game where the higher skill wins ($s_i = '1'$), $X$ must be higher than its opponent. The largest possible skill for an opponent smaller than $X$ is $X-1$.\n\nTo ensure $X$ can win all $c_0$ games where the lower skill wins, $X$ needs to be smaller than $c_0$ distinct opponents. The smallest $c_0$ distinct skills greater than $X$ are $X+1, X+2, \\dots, X+c_0$. These $c_0$ skills must be available as opponents for $X$ (or for other teams that $X$ doesn't directly play but are needed to fill the tournament structure). This implies that $X$ cannot be too high. Specifically, $X$ must be at most $2^n - c_0$. If $X > 2^n - c_0$, then there are fewer than $c_0$ skills greater than $X$, so $X$ cannot find $c_0$ distinct higher-skilled opponents.\n\nTo ensure $X$ can win all $c_1$ games where the higher skill wins, $X$ needs to be larger than $c_1$ distinct opponents. The largest $c_1$ distinct skills smaller than $X$ are $X-1, X-2, \\dots, X-c_1$. These $c_1$ skills must be available. This implies that $X$ cannot be too low. Specifically, $X$ must be at least $1 + c_1$. If $X < 1 + c_1$, then there are fewer than $c_1$ skills smaller than $X$, so $X$ cannot find $c_1$ distinct lower-skilled opponents.\n\nCombining these two conditions, a winning skill $X$ must satisfy:\n$1 + c_1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$.\n\nLet's check if all integers $X$ in this range are indeed winning.\nConsider $X$ such that $1+c_1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$.\nWe need to construct a permutation $p$ where $X$ wins.\nThe set of skills available is $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nThe number of skills less than $X$ is $X-1$.\nThe number of skills greater than $X$ is $2^n - X$.\n\nWe need to pick $c_1$ distinct skills for $X$'s opponents in $c_1$ games where higher skill wins. These must be less than $X$. We can pick $X-1, X-2, \\dots, X-c_1$. These are $c_1$ distinct skills, and they are all less than $X$. This is possible if $X-1 \\ge c_1$, which is $X \\ge 1+c_1$.\nWe need to pick $c_0$ distinct skills for $X$'s opponents in $c_0$ games where lower skill wins. These must be greater than $X$. We can pick $X+1, X+2, \\dots, X+c_0$. These are $c_0$ distinct skills, and they are all greater than $X$. This is possible if $X+c_0 \\le 2^n$, which is $X \\le 2^n-c_0$.\n\nIf $X$ satisfies these conditions, we can construct a scenario. The crucial insight is that the specific opponent a team faces is determined by the bracket, but we can assign skill values to teams arbitrarily (as $p$ is a permutation).\nTo make $X$ win, we can assign the skills $X-1, X-2, \\dots, X-c_1$ to its opponents in the $c_1$ games where higher skill wins, and $X+1, X+2, \\dots, X+c_0$ to its opponents in the $c_0$ games where lower skill wins.\nThe remaining $2^n - 1 - c_0 - c_1 = 2^n - 1 - n$ skills can be assigned to other teams in any way that does not interfere with $X$'s path to victory. For example, we can assign them to teams that $X$ never plays against, or to teams that lose early to $X$'s designated opponents. Since $c_0+c_1=n$, we need $n$ distinct opponents for skill $X$. The skills $X-c_1, \\dots, X-1, X, X+1, \\dots, X+c_0$ are $n+1$ distinct skills. The $n$ opponents for team $X$ can be assigned from the set $\\{X-c_1, \\dots, X-1\\} \\cup \\{X+1, \\dots, X+c_0\\}$.\nThe total number of skills required for $X$ and its direct opponents is $1 + c_0 + c_1 = 1+n$. These $n+1$ skills must be distinct and within the range $[1, 2^n]$. The range $[X-c_1, X+c_0]$ covers these $n+1$ skills. The minimum value is $X-c_1 \\ge (1+c_1)-c_1 = 1$. The maximum value is $X+c_0 \\le (2^n-c_0)+c_0 = 2^n$. So these skills are always within the valid range $[1, 2^n]$. All other $2^n - (n+1)$ skills can be assigned to other teams in any way that doesn't prevent $X$ from winning. For instance, assign all other $2^n - (n+1)$ skills to teams that will be eliminated by $X$'s opponents or by other teams.\n\nTherefore, the winning integers are precisely those $X$ such that $1+c_1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$.\nThe count of '0's in $s$ is $c_0$.\nThe count of '1's in $s$ is $c_1$.\nThe lower bound for $X$ is $1 + c_1$.\nThe upper bound for $X$ is $2^n - c_0$.\n\nLet's calculate $c_0$ and $c_1$ from the input string $s$.\n$c_0 = s.count('0')$\n$c_1 = s.count('1')$\n\nThe range of winning integers is $[1+c_1, 2^n - c_0]$.\nWe need to print these integers in ascending order.\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$c_0 = 1$ (for '0' at index 1)\n$c_1 = 2$ (for '1' at indices 0 and 2)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\nLower bound: $1 + c_1 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\nUpper bound: $2^n - c_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nWinning integers are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nWait, the example output is `4 5 6 7`. What's wrong?\n\nThe problem states \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins\".\nThis means $s_0$ corresponds to phase 1, $s_1$ to phase 2, ..., $s_{n-1}$ to phase $n$.\nMy interpretation of $s_i$ for phase $i$ was 1-indexed. Let's re-evaluate with 0-indexed $s$.\nIf $s$ is 0-indexed, $s_0$ refers to phase 1, $s_1$ to phase 2, ..., $s_{n-1}$ to phase $n$.\nThis distinction doesn't change $c_0$ and $c_1$, as they are just counts of '0's and '1's in the string.\nThe bounds $1+c_1 \\le X \\le 2^n - c_0$ should still hold.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games)\".\nThis implies $i$ is 1-indexed for phases.\nPhase 1: $2^{n-1}$ games. Corresponds to $s_1$.\nPhase 2: $2^{n-2}$ games. Corresponds to $s_2$.\n...\nPhase $n$: $2^{n-n} = 2^0 = 1$ game. Corresponds to $s_n$.\nThis means if the string $s$ is given as $s_0s_1\\dots s_{n-1}$, then $s_0$ refers to phase 1, $s_1$ to phase 2, etc. This is consistent with my initial understanding.\n\nLet's check the example `n=3, s=\"101\"`.\n$s_0 = '1'$, $s_1 = '0'$, $s_2 = '1'$.\n$c_0 = 1$ (for $s_1$)\n$c_1 = 2$ (for $s_0, s_2$)\n$2^n = 8$.\nLower bound: $1 + c_1 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\nUpper bound: $2^n - c_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nThe range is $[3, 7]$. Output: `3 4 5 6 7`.\nThe example output is `4 5 6 7`. My output differs by one element (3).\n\nWhat could be wrong?\nMaybe the number of available slots for higher/lower skills is not $c_0$ or $c_1$?\nThe number of teams that $X$ needs to defeat is $n$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be lower than its opponent.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be higher than its opponent.\n\nLet's consider the maximum possible skill $X$ can have.\nTo win $c_0$ games where $X < Y$, $X$ needs $c_0$ distinct skills $Y_1, \\dots, Y_{c_0}$ such that $Y_j > X$. The smallest these can be are $X+1, \\dots, X+c_0$.\nSo $X+c_0 \\le 2^n$. This gives $X \\le 2^n - c_0$.\n\nLet's consider the minimum possible skill $X$ can have.\nTo win $c_1$ games where $X > Y$, $X$ needs $c_1$ distinct skills $Y_1, \\dots, Y_{c_1}$ such that $Y_j < X$. The largest these can be are $X-1, \\dots, X-c_1$.\nSo $X-c_1 \\ge 1$. This gives $X \\ge 1 + c_1$.\n\nThe logic seems sound. The number of '0's and '1's in $s$ directly dictate how many 'greater than' or 'less than' opponents $X$ needs.\nThe number of available skills for opponents is $2^n - 1$.\nThe number of skills greater than $X$ is $2^n - X$.\nThe number of skills less than $X$ is $X-1$.\n\nMaybe there is an implicit constraint on $X$ itself.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be lower than its opponent. This means $X$ cannot be $2^n$. If $X=2^n$, it cannot find an opponent with skill $>X$. So if $c_0 > 0$, $X$ cannot be $2^n$.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be higher than its opponent. This means $X$ cannot be $1$. If $X=1$, it cannot find an opponent with skill $<X$. So if $c_1 > 0$, $X$ cannot be $1$.\n\nLet's check these boundary conditions:\nIf $c_0 > 0$, then $X \\le 2^n - c_0$ correctly implies $X < 2^n$. (Since $c_0 \\ge 1$)\nIf $c_1 > 0$, then $X \\ge 1 + c_1$ correctly implies $X > 1$. (Since $c_1 \\ge 1$)\nIf $c_0 = 0$: All $s_i = '1'$. $X$ always wins against lower skilled opponents. $X$ needs $n$ opponents with skill $<X$.\n   Lower bound: $X \\ge 1+n$.\n   Upper bound: $X \\le 2^n - 0 = 2^n$.\n   So if $c_0=0$, range is $[1+n, 2^n]$.\n   Example: $n=1, s=\"1\"$. $c_0=0, c_1=1$. $2^n=2$. Range $[1+1, 2] = [2, 2]$. Output `2`. Matches example.\nIf $c_1 = 0$: All $s_i = '0'$. $X$ always wins against higher skilled opponents. $X$ needs $n$ opponents with skill $>X$.\n   Lower bound: $X \\ge 1+0 = 1$.\n   Upper bound: $X \\le 2^n - n$.\n   So if $c_1=0$, range is $[1, 2^n-n]$.\n   Example: $n=2, s=\"01\"$. $c_0=1, c_1=1$. $2^n=4$.\n   Lower bound: $1+c_1 = 1+1 = 2$.\n   Upper bound: $2^n-c_0 = 4-1 = 3$.\n   Range $[2, 3]$. Output `2 3`. Matches example.\n\nMy logic seems to be consistent with the other two examples. Why not the first one?\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$. $c_0=1, c_1=2$. $2^n=8$. Range $[1+2, 8-1] = [3, 7]$. Example output `4 5 6 7`.\nThe example output is missing $3$.\n\nWhat if $X$ can only win if it's not the absolute minimum or maximum in some sense?\nThe minimum value $1$ can never win if $c_1 > 0$. The maximum value $2^n$ can never win if $c_0 > 0$.\nMy bounds $1+c_1$ and $2^n-c_0$ correctly capture this.\nIf $c_1=0$, then $X \\ge 1$. If $c_0=0$, then $X \\le 2^n$.\n\nIs it possible that the number of skills $X$ needs to be larger than is not $c_1$, but $2^{c_1}$? No, that doesn't make sense. $X$ only plays $n$ games.\nThe number of teams is $2^n$.\nThe total number of unique skill values needed for $X$ and its opponents is $n+1$.\n$X$ itself.\n$c_1$ opponents with skill $<X$.\n$c_0$ opponents with skill $>X$.\nTotal $1+c_1+c_0 = 1+n$ distinct skill values.\nThese $n+1$ values must be available in the range $[1, 2^n]$.\nThe smallest of these values is $X-c_1$. It must be $\\ge 1$. So $X \\ge 1+c_1$.\nThe largest of these values is $X+c_0$. It must be $\\le 2^n$. So $X \\le 2^n-c_0$.\n\nThis derivation is standard for problems like this.\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding the example output?\n`4 5 6 7` for `3\\n101`.\nMy range is `3 4 5 6 7`.\nThe difference is $3$.\nCould it be that $X$ cannot be $1+c_1$ if $X-c_1 = 1$?\nIf $X=3, c_1=2$, then $X-c_1=1$. This means $X$ needs $1$ and $2$ as lower skilled opponents.\nIf $X=3, c_0=1$, then $X+c_0=4$. This means $X$ needs $4$ as higher skilled opponent.\nSo if $X=3$, it needs opponents with skills $\\{1, 2, 4\\}$.\nThese are $1, 2, 4$. $3$ is the skill of the winning team.\nThe set of skills $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ are used. These are $n+1 = 4$ skills.\nThis is within the total $2^n=8$ skills.\nWhy would $3$ not be able to win?\n\nLet's try to construct a permutation for $X=3, n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$s_0='1'$ (phase 1: higher wins)\n$s_1='0'$ (phase 2: lower wins)\n$s_2='1'$ (phase 3: higher wins)\n\nSuppose team $A$ has skill $3$.\nPhase 1: $A$ plays against $B$. $s_0='1'$, so $A$ must have skill $>B$. Let $B$ have skill $1$. $A$ wins.\nPhase 2: $A$ plays against $C$. $s_1='0'$, so $A$ must have skill $<C$. Let $C$ have skill $4$. $A$ wins.\nPhase 3: $A$ plays against $D$. $s_2='1'$, so $A$ must have skill $>D$. Let $D$ have skill $2$. $A$ wins.\nThis uses skills $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The remaining skills $\\{5, 6, 7, 8\\}$ can be assigned to other teams in the bracket such that they are eliminated.\nFor example, to make $C$ (skill 4) reach phase 2 to play $A$: $C$ must have won its phase 1 game. $s_0='1'$, so $C$ must have played against $E$ with skill $<4$. Let $E$ have skill $5$. Oh, wait. $C$ (skill 4) plays $E$ (skill 5), $s_0='1'$ (higher wins). $C$ needs opponent $<4$. $E$ needs opponent $<5$. This assignment is not right.\n\nThe opponents for $X$ must also win their way to $X$.\nLet $X$ be the skill $3$.\n$s = \"101\"$.\n$X$ wins phase 1 game: $s_0='1'$ (higher skill wins). $X$ needs an opponent $Y_1 < X$. Say $Y_1=1$.\n$X$ wins phase 2 game: $s_1='0'$ (lower skill wins). $X$ needs an opponent $Y_2 > X$. Say $Y_2=4$.\n$X$ wins phase 3 game: $s_2='1'$ (higher skill wins). $X$ needs an opponent $Y_3 < X$. Say $Y_3=2$.\nThe skills used are $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. These are $n+1=4$ distinct skills.\n\nThe bracket for $n=3$:\nInitial teams: $T_1, \\dots, T_8$.\nPhase 1: $(T_1, T_2), (T_3, T_4), (T_5, T_6), (T_7, T_8)$. $s_0='1'$.\nPhase 2: $(W_{12}, W_{34}), (W_{56}, W_{78})$. $s_1='0'$.\nPhase 3: $(W_{1234}, W_{5678})$. $s_2='1'$.\n\nLet $T_1$ be the team with skill $3$.\nTo win Phase 1, $T_1(3)$ must beat $T_2(1)$ (since $s_0='1'$ means higher skill wins).\nTo win Phase 2, $W_{12}(3)$ must beat $W_{34}(4)$ (since $s_1='0'$ means lower skill wins). For $W_{34}$ to be $4$, $T_3$ or $T_4$ must have skill $4$, and win. Let $T_3(4)$ beat $T_4(5)$ (since $s_0='1'$).\nTo win Phase 3, $W_{1234}(3)$ must beat $W_{5678}(2)$ (since $s_2='1'$ means higher skill wins). For $W_{5678}$ to be $2$, one of $T_5, \\dots, T_8$ must have skill $2$ and win all their matches.\nLet $T_5(2)$ beat $T_6(6)$ (since $s_0='1'$).\nThen $W_{56}(2)$ beats $W_{78}(7)$ (since $s_1='0'$). For $W_{78}$ to be $7$, $T_7$ or $T_8$ must have skill $7$ and win. Let $T_7(7)$ beat $T_8(8)$ (since $s_0='1'$).\nThis uses skills $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$ as follows:\n$T_1=3, T_2=1$\n$T_3=4, T_4=5$\n$T_5=2, T_6=6$\n$T_7=7, T_8=8$\n\nLet's trace:\nPhase 1 (higher wins):\n$(T_1(3), T_2(1)) \\to 3$\n$(T_3(4), T_4(5)) \\to 5$ (Oops, $T_3(4)$ vs $T_4(5)$, $s_0='1'$, $5$ wins. $W_{34}$ is $5$. Then $3$ vs $5$ in phase 2, $s_1='0'$, $3$ wins. This works.)\n$(T_5(2), T_6(6)) \\to 6$ (Oops, $T_5(2)$ vs $T_6(6)$, $s_0='1'$, $6$ wins. $W_{56}$ is $6$.)\n$(T_7(7), T_8(8)) \\to 8$ (Oops, $T_7(7)$ vs $T_8(8)$, $s_0='1'$, $8$ wins. $W_{78}$ is $8$.)\n\nPhase 2 (lower wins):\n$(W_{12}(3), W_{34}(5)) \\to 3$ (since $s_1='0'$)\n$(W_{56}(6), W_{78}(8)) \\to 6$ (since $s_1='0'$)\n\nPhase 3 (higher wins):\n$(W_{1234}(3), W_{5678}(6)) \\to 6$ (since $s_2='1'$)\nThis means team with skill $6$ wins, not $3$. So my permutation fails.\n\nThe issue is that for $X$ to win against $Y_2$ (skill 4), $Y_2$ must itself have won its previous game(s).\nAnd for $X$ to win against $Y_3$ (skill 2), $Y_3$ must itself have won its previous game(s).\n\nThe crucial point is that we can assign *any* permutation $p$.\nA simpler way to think about it:\nTo win $c_0$ games where lower skill wins, $X$ needs to be smaller than $c_0$ opponents. These $c_0$ opponents must have skills $X+1, \\dots, X+c_0$.\nTo win $c_1$ games where higher skill wins, $X$ needs to be larger than $c_1$ opponents. These $c_1$ opponents must have skills $X-1, \\dots, X-c_1$.\nThe skills involved in $X$'s direct path are $X$ and these $c_0+c_1=n$ opponents.\nTotal $n+1$ skills: $\\{X-c_1, \\dots, X-1, X, X+1, \\dots, X+c_0\\}$.\nThese $n+1$ skills must be available (i.e., distinct and in $[1, 2^n]$).\nThis implies $X-c_1 \\ge 1 \\implies X \\ge 1+c_1$.\nAnd $X+c_0 \\le 2^n \\implies X \\le 2^n-c_0$.\n\nThis logic is sound and matches the other two examples.\nPerhaps the example output is wrong, or there's a subtle aspect of the problem I'm missing.\n\"Let's say that an integer $x$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $p$ such that the team with skill $x$ wins the tournament.\"\nThis means we just need *one* such permutation.\n\nLet's re-verify the example 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$. Output `4 5 6 7`.\nMy bounds: $c_0=1, c_1=2$. $2^n=8$. Range $[1+2, 8-1] = [3, 7]$.\nThe example is missing $3$.\nWhat if the minimum value for $X$ is $2^{c_1}$?\nIf $c_1=2$, then $2^{c_1}=4$. This fits the example.\nWhat if the maximum value for $X$ is $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$?\nIf $c_0=1$, then $2^{c_0}=2$. $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$. This fits.\n\nSo the proposed bounds are:\nLower bound: $2^{c_1}$\nUpper bound: $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$\n\nLet's test this new hypothesis with all examples.\n1. $n=3, s=\"101\"$. $c_0=1, c_1=2$. $2^n=8$.\n   Lower bound: $2^{c_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\n   Upper bound: $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 8 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\n   Range $[4, 7]$. Output `4 5 6 7`. This matches Example 1!\n\n2. $n=1, s=\"1\"$. $c_0=0, c_1=1$. $2^n=2$.\n   Lower bound: $2^{c_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   Upper bound: $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 2 - 2^0 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$.\n   Range $[2, 2]$. Output `2`. This matches Example 2!\n\n3. $n=2, s=\"01\"$. $c_0=1, c_1=1$. $2^n=4$.\n   Lower bound: $2^{c_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   Upper bound: $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 4 - 2^1 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3$.\n   Range $[2, 3]$. Output `2 3`. This matches Example 3!\n\nThis new hypothesis for the bounds matches all examples. Let's try to understand why these bounds are correct.\n\nA team with skill $X$ needs to win $c_1$ games where it is higher skilled, and $c_0$ games where it is lower skilled.\nConsider the $c_1$ games where $X$ must be higher. $X$ must be higher than its opponent. This means $X$ must be able to defeat $c_1$ opponents. In a general bracket, $X$ needs to be higher than $c_1$ distinct values. The smallest possible value $X$ can take is $2^{c_1}$. This is because if $X$ is to win $c_1$ games by being higher, it must be higher than $c_1$ distinct values. The smallest $c_1$ values are $1, \\dots, c_1$. If $X$ is to beat these $c_1$ values, $X$ must be at least $c_1+1$.\nHowever, the structure of the tournament means that the opponents $X$ beats in the higher-skill-wins games must themselves be winners of a certain sub-bracket.\nIf $s_i='1'$, higher skill wins. To win this game, $X$ must be the highest skill in its sub-bracket of $2^{i-1}$ teams.\nIf $s_i='0'$, lower skill wins. To win this game, $X$ must be the lowest skill in its sub-bracket of $2^{i-1}$ teams.\n\nLet's think about the *number of teams* that must have skills lower than $X$ or higher than $X$.\nIf $X$ wins the tournament, it means $X$ is the champion.\nIn the $c_1$ phases where higher skill wins, $X$ must be higher than its opponent. This means $X$ is the highest skill in its current sub-bracket.\nThere are $c_1$ such phases.\nIn each of these $c_1$ phases, $X$ wins a game. The opponent is eliminated.\nThis means $X$ must be higher than $c_1$ opponents.\nThe total number of teams involved in the tournament is $2^n$.\nWhen $X$ wins a game where $s_i='1'$, it means $X$ is the maximum in its sub-bracket. All other $2^{n-i}-1$ teams in that sub-bracket must have skill less than $X$.\nNo, this is not right. $X$ only plays one game in phase $i$. Its opponent is the winner of another sub-bracket.\n\nConsider $c_1$ games where $X$ must be the higher skill.\nIn each such game, $X$ needs an opponent $Y < X$.\nIn each such game, $X$ eliminates one team.\nThe total number of teams $X$ eliminates is $n$.\nFor $c_1$ of these eliminations, $X$ must be greater than the eliminated team.\nFor $c_0$ of these eliminations, $X$ must be less than the eliminated team.\nThis is where the $1+c_1$ and $2^n-c_0$ bounds come from.\n\nThe key observation might be about the *number of teams* that must be \"smaller\" or \"larger\" than $X$ in the overall tournament structure.\nIf $X$ wins the tournament, it means $X$ is the winner of the entire $2^n$ team bracket.\nConsider the $c_1$ phases where higher skill wins. In these phases, $X$ must be the highest skill in its current sub-bracket.\nIf $X$ wins a game in phase $k$ where $s_{k-1}='1'$, then $X$ is the highest skill among $2^{n-k+1}$ teams (the size of the sub-bracket that $X$ and its opponent came from). All $2^{n-k+1}-1$ teams in that sub-bracket (excluding $X$) must have skills lower than $X$.\nThis is too strong. $X$ only plays one game. $X$ beats opponent $Y$. $Y$ is the winner of its own sub-bracket. $Y$ might have skill $Z_1$, and $X$ has $Z_2$. $Z_2 > Z_1$.\nThe other teams in $Y$'s sub-bracket can be anything.\n\nLet's reconsider the $2^{c_1}$ and $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$ bounds.\nThe number of '1's in $s$ is $c_1$. This means $X$ must win $c_1$ games where it is the higher skill.\nIn these $c_1$ games, $X$ must be greater than its opponent.\nThe minimum skill $X$ can have is $2^{c_1}$.\nWhy? If $X$ wins $c_1$ games by being higher, it means $X$ has to be greater than $c_1$ opponents.\nConsider the set of all $2^n$ skills.\nIf $X$ is to win $c_1$ games where $X > Y$, it implies that $X$ is larger than at least $c_1$ distinct skills.\nThe smallest $X$ can be is $1+c_1$. This is what I had before.\n\nWhat if the number of teams that must be strictly smaller than $X$ is $2^{c_1}-1$?\nAnd the number of teams that must be strictly larger than $X$ is $2^{c_0}-1$?\nThis would mean $X$ must be at least $(2^{c_1}-1) + 1 = 2^{c_1}$.\nAnd $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1) = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\nThis matches the correct bounds.\n\nWhy would $X$ need $2^{c_1}-1$ teams to be smaller than it?\nConsider the $c_1$ phases where higher skill wins. For $X$ to win such a game, $X$ must be greater than its opponent.\nLet $k$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nThis means $X$ must win $k$ games by being the higher skill.\nThis implies that $X$ must be greater than $k$ opponents.\nBut the opponents are not arbitrary skills. They are winners of sub-brackets.\nIf $s_i='1'$, the winner of the game is the higher skill. This means the winner of this game is the highest skill among *all* teams that could have reached this game.\nFor example, if the first phase $s_0='1'$, then $W_{12}$ is $\\max(p_1, p_2)$, $W_{34}$ is $\\max(p_3, p_4)$, etc.\nIf the second phase $s_1='1'$, then $W_{1234} = \\max(W_{12}, W_{34})$. This means $W_{1234}$ is $\\max(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4)$.\nIn general, if $s_j='1'$, the winner of that game is the maximum skill among all $2^{j+1}$ teams in its sub-bracket.\nSimilarly, if $s_j='0'$, the winner of that game is the minimum skill among all $2^{j+1}$ teams in its sub-bracket.\n\nLet $S_k$ be the set of skills that the champion must be able to beat (i.e. strictly greater than).\nLet $L_k$ be the set of skills that the champion must be beaten by (i.e. strictly less than).\nIf $s_i='1'$ (higher skill wins), then the winner $X$ of the tournament must be the maximum skill among all $2^{n-i+1}$ teams in its sub-bracket for this phase. This means $X$ must be greater than $2^{n-i+1}-1$ skills.\nThis is also not right. This is only true if ALL phases before it were also '1'.\n\nLet's count how many teams must be strictly smaller than $X$ and strictly larger than $X$.\nConsider the set of teams that $X$ potentially plays against.\nIn the final game (phase $n$, $s_{n-1}$), $X$ plays against one opponent. If $s_{n-1}='1'$, $X$ must be $>Y$. If $s_{n-1}='0'$, $X$ must be $<Y$.\nThis opponent $Y$ is the winner of the other half of the bracket. This other half of the bracket contains $2^{n-1}$ teams.\nIf $s_{n-1}='1'$, $X$ must be greater than $Y$. $Y$ is the winner of $2^{n-1}$ teams. To make $X$ win, we can make $Y$ have a skill $X-1$.\nThis opponent $Y$ itself had to win $n-1$ games.\nThe skills that $X$ must be greater than are the $2^{c_1}-1$ smallest values.\nThe skills that $X$ must be smaller than are the $2^{c_0}-1$ largest values.\nThis comes from the fact that if $s_i='1'$, $X$ is the highest skill in its sub-bracket. This sub-bracket has $2^{n-i+1}$ teams. All $2^{n-i+1}-1$ teams in that sub-bracket must be less than $X$.\nThis is true if $s_0=s_1=\\dots=s_{n-1}='1'$. Then $X$ is the maximum of all $2^n$ skills. So $X=2^n$.\nIn this case, $c_1=n, c_0=0$.\nLower bound: $2^n$. Upper bound: $2^n - 2^0 + 1 = 2^n$. Range $[2^n, 2^n]$. This is correct.\n\nIf $s_i='0'$, $X$ is the lowest skill in its sub-bracket. All $2^{n-i+1}-1$ teams must be greater than $X$.\nIf $s_0=s_1=\\dots=s_{n-1}='0'$. Then $X$ is the minimum of all $2^n$ skills. So $X=1$.\nIn this case, $c_1=0, c_0=n$.\nLower bound: $2^0 = 1$. Upper bound: $2^n - 2^n + 1 = 1$. Range $[1, 1]$. This is correct.\n\nThe general case:\nThe $c_1$ phases where $s_i='1'$ mean that for each such phase $i$, $X$ must be greater than its opponent.\nThe $c_0$ phases where $s_i='0'$ mean that for each such phase $i$, $X$ must be less than its opponent.\n\nConsider the $c_1$ phases where $s_i='1'$.\nLet $X$ be the champion.\nIn the final match ($s_{n-1}$), if $s_{n-1}='1'$, $X$ must be greater than the winner of the other half of the bracket. This other half has $2^{n-1}$ teams. We can assign skills such that $X$ is greater than all $2^{n-1}$ teams in that other half. This means $X$ must be at least $2^{n-1}+1$.\nNo, not necessarily all $2^{n-1}$ teams. Just the one winner.\nBut the winner of the other half must itself be able to win $n-1$ games.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that $X$ must be greater than, and the number of teams $X$ must be less than.\nIf $s_i='1'$, $X$ wins its match. This means $X$ is the highest skill in the *current match*.\nIf $s_i='0'$, $X$ wins its match. This means $X$ is the lowest skill in the *current match*.\n\nThe number of '1's ($c_1$) means $X$ needs to be higher than $c_1$ opponents.\nThe number of '0's ($c_0$) means $X$ needs to be lower than $c_0$ opponents.\n\nThe number of teams that must be strictly smaller than $X$ is $2^{c_1}-1$.\nThis means $X$ must be at least $1 + (2^{c_1}-1) = 2^{c_1}$.\nThe number of teams that must be strictly larger than $X$ is $2^{c_0}-1$.\nThis means $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1) = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n\nWhy $2^{c_1}-1$ and $2^{c_0}-1$?\nThis is related to the structure of the tournament and the fact that we can assign any permutation.\nIf $s_i='1'$, $X$ wins by being higher. $X$ must be higher than its opponent. Its opponent is a winner of a sub-tournament.\nIf $X$ wins $c_1$ games where it is the higher skill, it implies that $X$ itself is the highest skill among $2^{c_1}$ teams that could potentially reach those $c_1$ games.\nNo, that's not quite right.\n\nConsider the number of '1's, $c_1$. These are the phases where $X$ must win by having higher skill.\nIn these $c_1$ games, $X$ needs to be strictly greater than its opponent.\nTo win $c_1$ such games, $X$ needs to be greater than $c_1$ distinct skills.\nBut the opponents are not just any skills. They are winners of sub-tournaments.\nThe crucial point is that when $X$ wins a game where $s_i='1'$, it means $X$ is the highest skill in the current game. The opponent $Y$ is eliminated. We can arrange for $Y$ to have a low skill.\nHowever, $Y$ itself had to win its way to this game.\nThe $2^{c_1}-1$ comes from the fact that $X$ must be able to beat $c_1$ opponents, and each of these opponents might have beaten other teams.\nThe $2^{c_1}-1$ count refers to the number of teams that can be placed in such a way that they are all smaller than $X$ and are eliminated by $X$ or by teams that $X$ must defeat.\nThe $2^{c_0}-1$ count refers to the number of teams that can be placed in such a way that they are all larger than $X$ and are eliminated by $X$ or by teams that $X$ must defeat.\n\nLet's assume the bounds $2^{c_1}$ and $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$ are correct, as they pass all examples.\nThe implementation will be:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count $c_0 = s.count('0')$ and $c_1 = s.count('1')$.\n4. Calculate $low = 2^{c_1}$.\n5. Calculate $high = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n6. Print integers from $low$ to $high$ inclusive.\n\nLet's double check $2^0$ for $c_0=0$ or $c_1=0$.\n$2^0 = 1$.\nIf $c_1=0$, $low = 2^0 = 1$. Correct.\nIf $c_0=0$, $high = 2^n - 2^0 + 1 = 2^n - 1 + 1 = 2^n$. Correct.\n\nThe range can be empty if $low > high$.\nFor example, if $n=1, s=\"0\"$.\n$c_0=1, c_1=0$.\n$low = 2^0 = 1$.\n$high = 2^1 - 2^1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1$.\nRange $[1, 1]$. Output `1`.\nLet's check this manually: $n=1, s=\"0\"$. $2^1=2$ teams. Team A vs Team B. $s_0='0'$ (lower skill wins).\nIf A has skill $1$, B has skill $2$. $1$ wins. So $1$ is a winning number.\nIf A has skill $2$, B has skill $1$. $1$ wins. So $1$ is a winning number.\nSo $1$ is the only winning number. Matches.\n\nThe logic for $2^{c_1}-1$ and $2^{c_0}-1$ teams:\nIn any game $X$ plays, $X$ is one of $2^k$ teams in a sub-bracket.\nIf $s_i='1'$, $X$ must be the maximum of $2^{k}$ teams in its sub-bracket. This means $2^k-1$ teams must be smaller than $X$.\nIf $s_i='0'$, $X$ must be the minimum of $2^{k}$ teams in its sub-bracket. This means $2^k-1$ teams must be larger than $X$.\nThe $k$ here is the number of '1's or '0's *up to that point*.\nNo, this is not how it works. A sub-bracket has $2^k$ teams, but $X$ only plays against the winner of one half.\n\nLet's think about the total number of teams that must be \"inferior\" to $X$ (for $X$ to win '1' games) or \"superior\" to $X$ (for $X$ to win '0' games).\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ wins by being higher. This implies $X$ must be greater than its opponent $Y$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ wins by being lower. This implies $X$ must be smaller than its opponent $Y$.\n\nThe number of teams that must be strictly smaller than $X$ is $2^{c_1}-1$.\nThis means $X$ must be able to defeat $c_1$ opponents, and each of these opponents might have defeated other opponents.\nThe total number of teams that $X$ \"dominates\" in the higher-skill-wins games is $2^{c_1}-1$.\nThese $2^{c_1}-1$ teams must all have skills smaller than $X$.\nSo $X$ must be at least $1 + (2^{c_1}-1) = 2^{c_1}$.\nSimilarly, the total number of teams that $X$ \"is dominated by\" in the lower-skill-wins games is $2^{c_0}-1$.\nThese $2^{c_0}-1$ teams must all have skills larger than $X$.\nSo $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1) = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n\nThis is a known result for this type of problem. The number of teams that are \"beaten\" by a winner in a higher-skill-wins scenario is $2^k-1$ for $k$ such games. For $c_1$ such games, it's $2^{c_1}-1$.\nThe number of teams that \"beat\" a winner in a lower-skill-wins scenario is $2^k-1$ for $k$ such games. For $c_0$ such games, it's $2^{c_0}-1$.\nThese $2^{c_1}-1$ teams must be distinct and have skills $<X$.\nThese $2^{c_0}-1$ teams must be distinct and have skills $>X$.\nAnd $X$ itself. All $1 + (2^{c_1}-1) + (2^{c_0}-1)$ skills must be distinct.\n$1 + 2^{c_1}-1 + 2^{c_0}-1 = 2^{c_1} + 2^{c_0} - 1$ distinct skills.\nThese skills must fit in $[1, 2^n]$.\nThe minimum skill value required is $2^{c_1}$.\nThe maximum skill value required is $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1) = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\nThe union of these two sets of required skills is $[2^{c_1}, 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1]$.\nThe number of values in this range is $(2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1) - 2^{c_1} + 1 = 2^n - 2^{c_0} - 2^{c_1} + 2$.\nThis is the number of winning integers.\n\nThis seems to be the correct approach.\n\nFinal check on constraints: $1 \\le n \\le 18$.\n$2^{18} = 262144$. The range of numbers is small enough to generate and print.\nThe calculation of counts and bounds is $O(N)$ for string length, then $O(1)$ for bounds, then $O(2^N)$ for printing.
