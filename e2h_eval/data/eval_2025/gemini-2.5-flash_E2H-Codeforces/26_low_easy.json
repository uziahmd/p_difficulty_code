Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Triangle Counting with Constraints: A More Efficient Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to efficiently count non-degenerate triangles. The tricky part is the integer side lengths `x`, `y`, and `z` must fall within specific ranges: `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`. Classic problem, but the constraints might trip me up with brute-force.\n\nThe core condition for a triangle is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Given the ordering constraint `x <= y <= z`, two of these inequalities are trivially satisfied. Only `x + y > z` remains.\n\nA brute-force solution with three nested loops over the possible values of `x`, `y`, and `z` would be way too slow. The worst-case time complexity, `O(B*C*D)`, is a no-go with these potentially large bounds. I need a smarter approach.\n\nMy plan: instead of iterating through all combinations, let's fix `x` and `y` and then figure out the valid range for `z`. We know `C <= z <= D` and we have the inequality `z < x + y`.  Combining these, the valid range for `z` is `max(C, 1) <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`. Since we know that all sides are at least 1, the lower bound is just `C`.\n\nNow, if I iterate through all possible `x` and `y` values, the number of valid `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThis reduces the problem to a double loop, iterating `x` from `A` to `B` and `y` from `B` to `C`. This looks more manageable. This is `O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1))` which is still going to be computationally expensive. I'll need to double check the worst case and see how to optimize from there.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we know that `x <= y <= z`.\nFrom this, `x + z > y` is always true because `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`. So `x + z >= y + x > y`.\nSimilarly, `y + z > x` is always true because `y >= x` and `z >= x`. So `y + z >= x + x = 2x > x` (since `x >= 1`).\nTherefore, the only condition we need to check is `x + y > z`. This can be rewritten as `z < x + y`.\n\nWe need to count triplets `(x, y, z)` satisfying:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `z < x + y`\n\nCombining conditions 3 and 4 for `z`: `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nFor a fixed `x` and `y`, the number of valid `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `count_z(x, y) = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThe total count is `sum(sum(count_z(x, y) for y in range(B, C + 1)) for x in range(A, B + 1))`.\n\nA direct iteration over `x` and `y` would be `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1))`. In the worst case, `A=1, B=2.5e5, C=5e5`, this is `2.5e5 * 2.5e5 = 6.25e10`, which is too slow given `D <= 5e5`.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach. Let `S = x + y`.\nThe range for `x` is `[A, B]`.\nThe range for `y` is `[B, C]`.\nThe minimum possible sum `S_min = A + B`.\nThe maximum possible sum `S_max = B + C`.\nThe number of `z` values for a given `S = x + y` is `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `k = min(D, S - 1) - C + 1`. We are interested in `k` when `k > 0`.\nThis means `min(D, S - 1) > C - 1`.\nIf `S - 1 <= C - 1` (i.e., `S <= C`), then `min(D, S - 1) = S - 1`. The count is `S - 1 - C + 1 = S - C`. This is positive if `S > C`. So for `S` in `(C, D+1]`, the count is `S - C`.\nIf `S - 1 > C - 1` (i.e., `S > C`), then `min(D, S - 1)` could be `D` or `S - 1`.\nSpecifically, if `S - 1 <= D`, the count is `S - 1 - C + 1 = S - C`.\nIf `S - 1 > D`, the count is `D - C + 1`. This applies when `S > D + 1`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `count_z(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThis function `count_z(S)` is non-decreasing with `S`. It is 0 for `S <= C`.\nFor `S > C`:\n- If `S - 1 <= D` (i.e., `S <= D + 1`), then `count_z(S) = (S - 1) - C + 1 = S - C`.\n- If `S - 1 > D` (i.e., `S > D + 1`), then `count_z(S) = D - C + 1`.\n\nWe can iterate `x` from `A` to `B`. For each `x`, `y` ranges from `B` to `C`.\nThe sum `S = x + y` ranges from `x + B` to `x + C`.\nFor a fixed `x`, we need to sum `count_z(x + y)` for `y` from `B` to `C`.\nThis is `sum(count_z(S) for S in range(x + B, x + C + 1))`.\n\nThis structure suggests iterating `x` and then using a prefix sum array or similar technique for `count_z(S)`.\nLet `f(S) = count_z(S)`. We need `sum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C f(x+y)`.\nThis is equivalent to `sum_{x=A}^B (sum_{S=x+B}^{x+C} f(S))`.\n\nLet `max_val = D + C`. The maximum possible sum `x+y` is `B+C`, which can be up to `5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6`.\nLet `prefix_sum_f[k] = sum_{S=0}^k f(S)`.\nThen `sum_{S=x+B}^{x+C} f(S) = prefix_sum_f[x+C] - prefix_sum_f[x+B-1]`.\nSo the total sum is `sum_{x=A}^B (prefix_sum_f[x+C] - prefix_sum_f[x+B-1])`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Precompute `f(S)` for `S` from `0` to `B + C`.\n   `f(S) = 0` if `S <= C`.\n   `f(S) = S - C` if `C < S <= D + 1`.\n   `f(S) = D - C + 1` if `S > D + 1`.\n   The maximum value for `S` is `B + C`, which can be up to `5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6`. Let `MAX_S = B + C`.\n   Let `f_values` be an array of size `MAX_S + 1`.\n   Initialize `f_values[S] = 0` for `S` from `0` to `C`.\n   For `S` from `C + 1` to `MAX_S`:\n     `f_values[S] = min(D, S - 1) - C + 1`.\n     (Note: `min(D, S - 1)` is `S-1` if `S <= D+1`, and `D` if `S > D+1`. This matches the piecewise definition.)\n\n2. Compute prefix sums of `f_values`.\n   `prefix_sum_f[k] = sum_{i=0}^k f_values[i]`.\n   `prefix_sum_f` will be an array of size `MAX_S + 1`.\n   `prefix_sum_f[0] = f_values[0]`.\n   For `k` from `1` to `MAX_S`:\n     `prefix_sum_f[k] = prefix_sum_f[k-1] + f_values[k]`.\n\n3. Calculate the total answer.\n   Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n   For `x` from `A` to `B`:\n     `lower_sum_idx = x + B - 1`\n     `upper_sum_idx = x + C`\n     `current_x_sum = prefix_sum_f[upper_sum_idx] - prefix_sum_f[lower_sum_idx]`\n     `total_triangles += current_x_sum`\n\nThe maximum value for `B+C` is `5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6`.\nStep 1 takes `O(B+C)` time.\nStep 2 takes `O(B+C)` time.\nStep 3 takes `O(B-A+1)` time, which is at most `O(B)`.\nThe overall time complexity is `O(B+C)`, which is efficient enough for `B, C <= 5e5`. `1e6` operations are fine.\n\nExample 1: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4\nMAX_S = B+C = 2+3 = 5.\nf_values array:\nS=0: f(0)=0\nS=1: f(1)=0\nS=2: f(2)=0\nS=3: f(3)=0 (because S <= C)\nS=4: f(4) = min(D, S-1) - C + 1 = min(4, 3) - 3 + 1 = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1.\nS=5: f(5) = min(D, S-1) - C + 1 = min(4, 4) - 3 + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2.\nf_values = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2] (indices 0 to 5)\n\nprefix_sum_f:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3] (indices 0 to 5)\n\nIterate x from A=1 to B=2:\nx=1:\n  lower_sum_idx = 1 + B - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2\n  upper_sum_idx = 1 + C = 1 + 3 = 4\n  current_x_sum = prefix_sum_f[4] - prefix_sum_f[2] = 1 - 0 = 1.\n  total_triangles = 1.\nx=2:\n  lower_sum_idx = 2 + B - 1 = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3\n  upper_sum_idx = 2 + C = 2 + 3 = 5\n  current_x_sum = prefix_sum_f[5] - prefix_sum_f[3] = 3 - 0 = 3.\n  total_triangles = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nFinal answer: 4.
