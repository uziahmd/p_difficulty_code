The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Radio Tower Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to calculate the probability of a valid radio tower configuration. This is a classic competitive programming setup, focusing on combinatorial probability and modular arithmetic. My task is to figure out the likelihood that a valid arrangement of radio towers exists, given a random placement scheme. The output needs to be a number modulo 998244353.\n\nLet's break this down. We have `n+2` towns, numbered `0` to `n+1`, arranged linearly. Towers are randomly built in towns `1` through `n`, with each town having a 50% chance of getting a tower. Each tower has a signal power, an integer between 1 and `n`. A tower at town `i` with power `p` covers towns within a distance of `p` - specifically, towns `i - p + 1` to `i + p - 1`. The challenge is that the power assignments need to satisfy some constraints.\n\nConstraint number one: towns `0` and `n+1` must remain uncovered. This immediately puts some restrictions on the possible signal powers for the towers. If a tower is at town `i`, the signal power must be small enough that it doesn't spill over to either town `0` or `n+1`. Therefore the power must be less than or equal to both `i` and `n+1-i`.\n\nConstraint number two is even more crucial: each of the towns `1` to `n` must be covered by *exactly one* tower. In other words, the coverage intervals from each tower cannot overlap, and their union must exactly match the set `{1, 2, ..., n}`. This gives us a strong restriction on possible power assignment for towers. Each covered town can only be covered by a single tower.\n\nNow, let's analyze the coverage interval `[i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]` for a tower at `i` with power `p_i`. The interval's length is `2p_i - 1`. The center is the tower location `i`. The covered towns are neatly listed. My goal now is to efficiently determine the number of valid configurations to calculate the probability.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that a valid assignment of signal powers exists, given a random selection of towns for radio towers. There are $n+2$ towns, $0$ to $n+1$. Towers are built in towns $1, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$ each, independently.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each town $i \\in S$, we choose a signal power $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. A tower at town $i$ with power $p_i$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$. This means it covers the interval $[i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]$.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.\n   For any tower at $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$:\n   - $i - p_i + 1 > 0 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n   - $i + p_i - 1 < n+1 \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$.\n   Thus, $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from *exactly one* radio tower each.\n   This means the union of all coverage intervals $[i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]$ for $i \\in S$ must be exactly $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, and these intervals must be disjoint. If they were allowed to overlap, a town could be covered by multiple towers. \"Exactly one\" implies disjoint coverage regions.\n\nLet's consider the towns $i \\in S$. Each $i$ covers an interval $[L_i, R_i]$ where $L_i = i - p_i + 1$ and $R_i = i + p_i - 1$.\nThe conditions $p_i \\le i$ and $p_i \\le n+1-i$ ensure $L_i \\ge 1$ and $R_i \\le n$.\nFor the intervals to be disjoint and cover $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ exactly, they must form a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. That is, if $S = \\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k\\}$ with $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$, then we must have:\n$L_{i_1} = 1$\n$R_{i_j} = L_{i_{j+1}} - 1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$\n$R_{i_k} = n$\n\nFrom $L_i = i - p_i + 1$ and $R_i = i + p_i - 1$:\n$R_i - L_i + 1 = (i + p_i - 1) - (i - p_i + 1) + 1 = 2p_i - 1$.\nThis means each interval must have an odd length.\nAlso, $p_i = (R_i - L_i + 2)/2$. Since $p_i$ must be an integer, $R_i - L_i$ must be odd, which implies $R_i$ and $L_i$ must have different parities.\nThe center of the interval is $i = (L_i + R_i)/2$. For $i$ to be an integer, $L_i + R_i$ must be even, which means $L_i$ and $R_i$ must have the same parity.\nThis is a contradiction. $L_i$ and $R_i$ must have different parities for $p_i$ to be integer, but same parity for $i$ to be integer.\nThis implies that $i$ cannot be the exact center of the interval $[L_i, R_i]$ if $L_i$ and $R_i$ are integers and $p_i$ is an integer.\n\nLet's re-read the coverage definition: \"signal from a tower located in a town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches every city $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$.\"\nThis means $i - p < c < i + p$. So the towns covered are $i - p + 1, \\dots, i + p - 1$.\nThe interval of coordinates covered is $(i-p, i+p)$. The towns are integers.\nThe length of this interval is $2p-1$.\nThe conditions $p_i \\le i$ and $p_i \\le n+1-i$ ensure that the interval $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ is contained in $(0, n+1)$.\nSo all covered towns $c$ are in $1, \\dots, n$.\n\nFor the \"exactly one\" condition, the intervals $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ for $i \\in S$ must be disjoint and their union must be $(0, n+1)$.\nLet $S = \\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k\\}$ with $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$.\nThen we must have:\n$(i_1 - p_{i_1}, i_1 + p_{i_1}) \\cup (i_2 - p_{i_2}, i_2 + p_{i_2}) \\cup \\dots \\cup (i_k - p_{i_k}, i_k + p_{i_k}) = (0, n+1)$.\nAnd these intervals must be disjoint. This implies they must \"tile\" $(0, n+1)$.\nSo, $i_1 - p_{i_1} = 0$.\n$i_j + p_{i_j} = i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\n$i_k + p_{i_k} = n+1$.\n\nFrom $i - p_i = 0 \\implies p_i = i$.\nFrom $i + p_i = n+1 \\implies p_i = n+1-i$.\nFrom $i_j + p_{i_j} = i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}}$:\nLet $x_j = i_j + p_{i_j}$. This is the right endpoint of the $j$-th interval.\nLet $y_j = i_j - p_{i_j}$. This is the left endpoint of the $j$-th interval.\nThe conditions become:\n$y_1 = 0$\n$x_j = y_{j+1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$\n$x_k = n+1$\n\nSubstitute $p_i = i - y_i$ and $p_i = x_i - i$.\nSo $i - y_i = x_i - i \\implies 2i = x_i + y_i$.\nThis means $i$ is the midpoint of $(y_i, x_i)$.\nAlso, $p_i = (x_i - y_i)/2$. Since $p_i$ is an integer, $x_i - y_i$ must be an even integer.\nThe conditions $1 \\le p_i \\le n$ are automatically satisfied if $y_i, x_i$ are within $(0, n+1)$ and $x_i-y_i \\ge 2$.\n\nThe sequence of endpoints must be $0 = y_1 < x_1 = y_2 < x_2 = y_3 < \\dots < x_k = n+1$.\nAnd for each $j$, there must be a tower at $i_j = (x_j + y_j)/2$.\nSince $x_j - y_j$ must be even, and $x_j, y_j$ are integers, $x_j$ and $y_j$ must have the same parity.\nThis means $x_j + y_j$ must be even, so $i_j$ is always an integer.\nThe sequence of endpoints $0, x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k=n+1$ must consist of integers with the same parity.\nSince $0$ is even, all $x_j$ must be even.\nThus, $n+1$ must be even. If $n+1$ is odd (i.e., $n$ is even), no such configuration is possible.\nIn this case, the probability is $0$.\n\nIf $n$ is even, $n+1$ is odd. So the probability is $0$.\nExample $n=2$: $n+1=3$ (odd). Output $748683265$ (which is $1/4 \\bmod 998244353$). This contradicts my deduction.\nWhat went wrong? The example output for $n=2$ is $1/4$. For $n=5$, $n+1=6$ (even), output is $5/32$.\nMy deduction that $n+1$ must be even is based on $0$ being even. If $n+1$ is odd, then $x_k$ is odd. If $y_1=0$ is even, then all $x_j, y_j$ must be even. This implies $x_k$ must be even. Contradiction.\n\nThe issue must be in $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This is derived from $p_i < i+1$ and $p_i < n+1-i+1$.\nThe coverage is $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$.\nTown $0$ not covered: $i-p+1 > 0 \\implies p \\le i$.\nTown $n+1$ not covered: $i+p-1 < n+1 \\implies p \\le n+1-i$.\nThese are correct.\n\nLet's re-examine the example $n=2$. $n+1=3$.\nIf towers are at $1, 2$.\nFor tower $1$: $p_1 \\le \\min(1, 2+1-1) = \\min(1, 2) = 1$. So $p_1=1$. Covers $(1-1, 1+1) = (0, 2)$. Towns covered: $1$.\nFor tower $2$: $p_2 \\le \\min(2, 2+1-2) = \\min(2, 1) = 1$. So $p_2=1$. Covers $(2-1, 2+1) = (1, 3)$. Towns covered: $2$.\nUnion of coverage intervals: $(0,2) \\cup (1,3)$. This is NOT disjoint. Town $1$ is covered by tower $1$, town $2$ by tower $2$.\nThe condition is \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from *exactly one* radio tower each\".\nThis means for each $c \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there is exactly one $i \\in S$ such that $|c-i| < p_i$.\nThis implies that the *set* of towns covered by tower $i$, $C_i = \\{c \\mid i-p_i < c < i+p_i\\}$, must be disjoint for $i \\in S$, and their union must be $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nSo $C_i \\cap C_j = \\emptyset$ for $i \\ne j$, and $\\bigcup_{i \\in S} C_i = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nLet $L_i = i-p_i+1$ and $R_i = i+p_i-1$. These are the minimum and maximum towns covered by tower $i$.\nThe sets of towns $\\{L_i, \\dots, R_i\\}$ must partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis means if $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ with $i_1 < \\dots < i_k$:\n$L_{i_1} = 1$\n$R_{i_j} = L_{i_{j+1}} - 1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$\n$R_{i_k} = n$\n\nFrom these, $p_i = (R_i - L_i + 2)/2$.\n$i = (L_i + R_i)/2$.\nThe values $L_i, R_i$ must be integers.\nFor $p_i$ to be an integer, $R_i - L_i$ must be an odd integer. This means $L_i$ and $R_i$ must have different parities.\nFor $i$ to be an integer, $L_i + R_i$ must be an even integer. This means $L_i$ and $R_i$ must have the same parity.\nThese two conditions ($L_i, R_i$ different parities AND $L_i, R_i$ same parities) are contradictory.\n\nThis means my interpretation of \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\" or the definition of coverage must be slightly off.\nThe example for $n=5$: towers at $2, 4, 5$.\nTower $2$, power $2$: covers $|c-2|<2 \\implies 0<c<4$. Towns $1, 2, 3$.\nTower $4$, power $1$: covers $|c-4|<1 \\implies 3<c<5$. Town $4$.\nTower $5$, power $1$: covers $|c-5|<1 \\implies 4<c<6$. Town $5$.\nThe sets of towns covered are $\\{1,2,3\\}$, $\\{4\\}$, $\\{5\\}$. These are disjoint and their union is $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\nThis is a valid configuration.\nFor tower $2$, $L_2=1, R_2=3$. $p_2=(3-1+2)/2=2$. $i_2=(1+3)/2=2$. This works. $L_2, R_2$ have different parities. $i_2$ is integer.\nFor tower $4$, $L_4=4, R_4=4$. $p_4=(4-4+2)/2=1$. $i_4=(4+4)/2=4$. This works. $L_4, R_4$ have same parities. $i_4$ is integer.\nFor tower $5$, $L_5=5, R_5=5$. $p_5=(5-5+2)/2=1$. $i_5=(5+5)/2=5$. This works. $L_5, R_5$ have same parities. $i_5$ is integer.\n\nThe contradiction arose from assuming $L_i, R_i$ must have specific parities simultaneously.\nThe conditions are:\n1. $p_i$ is integer $\\implies R_i - L_i$ is odd.\n2. $i$ is integer $\\implies L_i + R_i$ is even.\nIf $R_i - L_i$ is odd, then $R_i$ and $L_i$ have different parities.\nIf $L_i + R_i$ is even, then $L_i$ and $R_i$ have the same parity.\nThese are indeed contradictory.\n\nThe only way this can work is if $p_i$ is not necessarily an integer for the formula $p_i = (R_i - L_i + 2)/2$.\nBut the problem states \"signal power on each tower to some integer from $1$ to $n$\".\nThis implies $p_i$ must be an integer.\n\nLet's check the coverage definition again: \"reaches every city $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$\".\nThis means $i-p < c < i+p$.\nThe cities are integers. So $c$ ranges from $\\lfloor i-p \\rfloor + 1$ to $\\lceil i+p \\rceil - 1$.\nSince $i$ is an integer, this is $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$.\nThis is what I used.\n\nWhat if $i$ is not the exact center? The problem states \"The $i$-th town is located at the point $i$\".\nAnd \"tower located in a town $i$\". So $i$ is an integer.\n\nCould it be that $p_i$ is an integer, but $i$ is not $(L_i+R_i)/2$?\nThe definition of $p_i$ is $i - (L_i-1)$ and $(R_i+1) - i$.\nSo $p_i = i - L_i + 1$ and $p_i = R_i - i + 1$.\nThis implies $i - L_i + 1 = R_i - i + 1 \\implies 2i = R_i + L_i$.\nThis is unavoidable. $i$ must be the midpoint of $L_i$ and $R_i$.\nSo $L_i$ and $R_i$ must have the same parity.\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is if $p_i$ is not an integer. But the problem states it must be.\nCould the problem statement imply something about $p_i$ being half-integer? No, \"integer from 1 to n\".\n\nLet's re-read the example carefully. $n=5$. Towers $2,4,5$.\nTower $2$, power $2$. $p_2=2$. Covered cities: $1,2,3$. $L_2=1, R_2=3$.\n$i_2 = (1+3)/2=2$. This works. $L_2, R_2$ have different parities.\nTower $4$, power $1$. $p_4=1$. Covered cities: $4$. $L_4=4, R_4=4$.\n$i_4 = (4+4)/2=4$. This works. $L_4, R_4$ have same parities.\nTower $5$, power $1$. $p_5=1$. Covered cities: $5$. $L_5=5, R_5=5$.\n$i_5 = (5+5)/2=5$. This works. $L_5, R_5$ have same parities.\n\nAh, the issue is that $p_i = (R_i - L_i + 2)/2$ is only valid if $L_i$ and $R_i$ are the *exact* boundaries of the interval.\n$p_i$ is the radius of coverage. The interval of towns covered is $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThe length of this interval is $2p_i-1$.\nLet $l_j$ be the length of the interval covered by tower $i_j$.\nThen $l_j = 2p_{i_j}-1$.\nThe towns $1, \\dots, n$ must be partitioned into intervals of lengths $l_1, \\dots, l_k$.\nSo $l_1 + l_2 + \\dots + l_k = n$.\nSince $l_j = 2p_{i_j}-1$, we have $\\sum_{j=1}^k (2p_{i_j}-1) = n$.\n$2 \\sum p_{i_j} - k = n$.\nThis implies $n+k$ must be even.\n\nLet $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the set of towns with towers.\nThe $j$-th tower $i_j$ covers towns $L_j, \\dots, R_j$.\n$L_j = i_j - p_{i_j} + 1$\n$R_j = i_j + p_{i_j} - 1$\nThe conditions are:\n$L_1 = 1$\n$R_j = L_{j+1}-1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$\n$R_k = n$\n\nFrom $L_j = i_j - p_{i_j} + 1$ and $R_j = i_j + p_{i_j} - 1$:\n$R_j - L_j = (i_j + p_{i_j} - 1) - (i_j - p_{i_j} + 1) = 2p_{i_j} - 2$.\nSo $2p_{i_j} = R_j - L_j + 2$. This implies $R_j - L_j$ must be even.\nThis means $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nAlso, $2i_j = L_j + R_j$. This means $L_j + R_j$ must be even.\nThis also means $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nSo both conditions are consistent now. $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\n\nThe sequence of boundary towns is $1 = L_1, R_1, L_2, R_2, \\dots, L_k, R_k = n$.\nThe values $R_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ are consecutive integers ($R_j = L_{j+1}-1$).\nIf $L_j$ and $R_j$ have the same parity, then $L_1=1$ (odd) implies $R_1$ must be odd.\nThen $L_2 = R_1+1$ must be even.\nThen $R_2$ must be even.\nThen $L_3 = R_2+1$ must be odd.\nAnd so on. The parities must alternate: $L_1$ odd, $R_1$ odd, $L_2$ even, $R_2$ even, $L_3$ odd, $R_3$ odd, ...\nThis means $L_j$ and $R_j$ have the same parity, and this parity is odd if $j$ is odd, and even if $j$ is even.\nFinally, $R_k=n$.\nIf $k$ is odd, $R_k$ must be odd. So $n$ must be odd.\nIf $k$ is even, $R_k$ must be even. So $n$ must be even.\nThis means $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\nRecall $n+k$ must be even. This is equivalent to $n$ and $k$ having the same parity. So this condition is consistent.\n\nSo, for a configuration of towers $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ to be valid, there must exist $p_{i_j}$ such that:\n1. $1 \\le p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n2. There is a sequence $1=L_1, R_1, L_2, R_2, \\dots, L_k, R_k=n$ such that $R_j=L_{j+1}-1$ for all $j$, and for each $j$, $i_j=(L_j+R_j)/2$ and $p_{i_j}=(R_j-L_j+2)/2$.\n3. All $p_{i_j}$ must be $\\ge 1$. This implies $R_j - L_j + 2 \\ge 2 \\implies R_j - L_j \\ge 0$. This is true since $R_j \\ge L_j$.\n4. All $i_j$ must be integers. This means $L_j+R_j$ must be even, so $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity. (Already deduced).\n5. All $p_{i_j} \\le n$. This is always true since $R_j - L_j + 2 \\le n - 1 + 2 = n+1$. Only $p_{i_j} = (n+1)/2$ is a potential issue if $n$ is odd and $L_j=1, R_j=n$. But $p_i \\le n+1-i$ and $p_i \\le i$ are stricter.\n\nThe critical conditions are:\n- $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity. (This implies $R_j-L_j$ is even, so $p_{i_j}$ is an integer).\n- $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ must be one of the towns in $S$.\n- $p_{i_j} \\le i_j$ and $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$.\n  Substituting $p_{i_j}=(R_j-L_j+2)/2$ and $i_j=(L_j+R_j)/2$:\n  $(R_j-L_j+2)/2 \\le (L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+2 \\le L_j+R_j \\implies 2 \\le 2L_j \\implies L_j \\ge 1$. This is already true ($L_1=1$, and $L_{j+1}=R_j+1 > R_j \\ge L_j \\ge 1$).\n  $(R_j-L_j+2)/2 \\le n+1-(L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+2 \\le 2n+2-L_j-R_j \\implies 2R_j \\le 2n \\implies R_j \\le n$. This is already true ($R_k=n$, and $R_j < R_k$ for $j<k$).\n  So the conditions $p_{i_j} \\le i_j$ and $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$ are automatically satisfied for any valid partition.\n\nTherefore, a set of towers $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ is valid if and only if:\n1. We can partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into $k$ contiguous segments of towns, $[L_1, R_1], \\dots, [L_k, R_k]$.\n2. For each segment $j$, the town $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ must be in $S$.\n3. For each segment $j$, $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity. (This implies $p_{i_j}$ is an integer).\n4. For each segment $j$, $i_j$ must be an integer. (This implies $L_j+R_j$ is even, which is same as $L_j, R_j$ same parity).\n\nThe requirement that $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity means that $R_j-L_j$ must be even.\nThe length of segment $j$ is $R_j-L_j+1$. This means the segment length must be odd.\nSo we need to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into segments of odd lengths.\nLet $l_j = R_j-L_j+1$ be the length of segment $j$.\nThen $\\sum l_j = n$, and each $l_j$ is odd.\nIf $k$ is the number of segments, then $n = \\sum_{j=1}^k l_j$. Since each $l_j$ is odd, $n$ must have the same parity as $k$.\nThis implies $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\n\nThe towns $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ are the *midpoints* of these odd-length segments.\nFor example, if $l_j=1$, segment is $[x,x]$, midpoint is $x$.\nIf $l_j=3$, segment is $[x,x+2]$, midpoint is $x+1$.\nIf $l_j=5$, segment is $[x,x+4]$, midpoint is $x+2$.\nIn general, for segment $[L_j, R_j]$ of odd length $l_j = 2m_j+1$, the midpoint is $L_j+m_j$.\nAll these midpoints $i_j$ must have towers.\nAll other towns $c \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ must *not* have towers.\n\nThis means a configuration of towers $S$ is valid if and only if $S$ is precisely the set of midpoints of a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into odd-length segments.\nLet $dp[x]$ be the number of ways to partition $\\{1, \\dots, x\\}$ into odd-length segments.\nTo compute $dp[x]$:\nThe last segment $[L_k, R_k]$ has length $l_k = R_k - L_k + 1$. $R_k=x$.\n$L_k = x - l_k + 1$.\n$l_k$ must be odd. So $l_k \\in \\{1, 3, 5, \\dots, x\\}$.\n$dp[x] = \\sum_{l_k \\in \\{1,3,\\dots,x\\}} dp[x-l_k]$.\nBase case: $dp[0]=1$ (empty partition).\n$dp[1] = dp[0] = 1$ (segment $[1,1]$ of length 1). Midpoint is 1.\n$dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$ (segment $[1,1]$ of length 1, segment $[2,2]$ of length 1). No, this is wrong.\n$dp[2]$: last segment can be length 1. So $dp[2-1]=dp[1]=1$. Partition: $[1,1], [2,2]$. Midpoints $\\{1,2\\}$.\n$dp[3]$:\n  last length 1: $dp[2]=1$. Partition: $[1,1], [2,2], [3,3]$. Midpoints $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n  last length 3: $dp[0]=1$. Partition: $[1,2,3]$. Midpoint $\\{2\\}$.\nSo $dp[3]=1+1=2$.\n\nThe recurrence is $dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-3] + \\dots + dp[x-(2m+1)]$ where $2m+1 \\le x$.\n$dp[x-2] = dp[x-3] + dp[x-5] + \\dots$.\nSo $dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-2]$. This is the Fibonacci sequence.\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$.\nLet $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, \\dots$ for $dp[x]$.\n$dp[0]=1$\n$dp[1]=dp[0]=1$\n$dp[2]=dp[1]=1$\n$dp[3]=dp[2]+dp[0]=1+1=2$\n$dp[4]=dp[3]+dp[1]=2+1=3$\n$dp[5]=dp[4]+dp[2]=3+1=4$\nThis sequence is $F_{n+1}$ where $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, \\dots$.\nNo, $dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1, dp[2]=1, dp[3]=2, dp[4]=3, dp[5]=4$.\nThis is $dp[x] = \\text{Fibonacci}(x)$ if $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, \\dots$.\nNo, this is $dp[x] = F_{x+1}$ where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$ standard Fibonacci.\n$dp[0]=1$ (special base case)\n$dp[1]=F_2=1$\n$dp[2]=F_3=2$? No. $dp[2]=dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-3] + \\dots$\n$dp[x-2] = dp[x-3] + dp[x-5] + \\dots$\nSo $dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-2]$ for $x \\ge 3$.\n$dp[0]=1$\n$dp[1]=1$\n$dp[2]=1$\n$dp[3]=dp[2]+dp[1]=1+1=2$\n$dp[4]=dp[3]+dp[2]=2+1=3$\n$dp[5]=dp[4]+dp[3]=3+2=5$\nThis is standard Fibonacci shifted. Let $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThen $dp[x] = F_{x+1}$ for $x \\ge 1$.\nAnd $dp[0]=1$.\nThe number of ways to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into odd-length segments is $dp[n]$.\nFor each such partition, say it has $k$ segments. This implies $n \\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\nThe set of midpoints $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ is uniquely determined by the partition.\nFor this set $S$, all towns in $S$ must have towers, and all towns in $\\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S$ must *not* have towers.\nThe probability of this exact configuration occurring is $(1/2)^k \\cdot (1/2)^{n-k} = (1/2)^n$.\nThis probability is the same for all valid partitions.\nSo the total probability is $dp[n] \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\n\nLet's check $n=2$: $dp[2]=1$. Probability $1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Correct.\n$n=3$: $dp[3]=2$. Probability $2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. Correct.\n$n=5$: $dp[5]=5$. Probability $5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$. Correct.\n\nThe solution is to calculate $F_{n+1}$ (standard Fibonacci) for $n \\ge 1$, and $1$ for $n=0$ (though $n \\ge 1$).\nThen multiply by $2^n$ inverse modulo $998244353$.\n\nFibonacci sequence calculation:\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$\nWe need $F_{n+1}$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_2=1$.\nFor $n=2$, $F_3=2$. (My $dp[2]=1$ was wrong, $dp[2]$ for $n=2$ should be $F_3=2$ according to $dp[x]=F_{x+1}$ for $x \\ge 1$. Let's re-evaluate $dp[2]$ from definition.)\n$dp[2]$: partition $\\{1,2\\}$ into odd length segments.\nPossible last segment lengths $l_k$:\n- $l_k=1$: last segment is $[2,2]$. Remaining part is $\\{1\\}$. $dp[1]=1$. Partition: $[1,1],[2,2]$. Midpoints $\\{1,2\\}$.\nSo $dp[2]=dp[1]=1$. This means $dp[x]=F_{x+1}$ for $x \\ge 1$ is not fully correct if $F_2=1$.\nMy $dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-2]$ for $x \\ge 3$ is correct.\n$dp[0]=1$\n$dp[1]=1$ (last segment $[1,1]$, $dp[0]=1$)\n$dp[2]=1$ (last segment $[2,2]$, $dp[1]=1$)\n$dp[3]=2$ (last segment $[3,3]$, $dp[2]=1$; last segment $[1,2,3]$, $dp[0]=1$)\n$dp[4]=3$ (last segment $[4,4]$, $dp[3]=2$; last segment $[2,3,4]$, $dp[1]=1$)\n$dp[5]=5$ (last segment $[5,5]$, $dp[4]=3$; last segment $[3,4,5]$, $dp[2]=1$; last segment $[1,2,3,4,5]$, $dp[0]=1$)\nThis is $dp[x] = F_{x-1}+F_{x-2}$ for $x \\ge 3$\nThe sequence $dp[x]$ is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \\dots$ for $x=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \\dots$\nThis is $F_{x-1}$ for $x \\ge 2$, if $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2$.\nLet's use the standard $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThen $dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[2]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[3]=F_3=2$.\n$dp[4]=F_4=3$.\n$dp[5]=F_5=5$.\nSo for $x \\ge 1$, $dp[x]$ is $F_x$ if $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$. (i.e. $F_x$ with $F_1=1, F_2=1$ as base cases).\nThis is $F_{x}$ in a sequence where $F_0=1, F_1=1$.\nOr, $F_{x+1}$ using $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$ for $x \\ge 1$, except $dp[2]=1$ which is $F_2$.\nThe sequence is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$ for $x=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \\dots$.\nFor $x \\ge 2$, $dp[x] = F_{x-1} + F_{x-2} = F_x$ (using $F_0=1, F_1=1$).\nThis is $F_{n+1}$ with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n$dp[1]=1$. $F_2=1$.\n$dp[2]=1$. $F_3=2$. So $dp[2] \\ne F_3$.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[x] = F_{x-1} + F_{x-2}$ for $x \\ge 2$.\n$dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0]$ is not correct. $dp[2]=dp[1]$ only.\nThe recurrence $dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-2]$ is valid for $x \\ge 3$.\n$dp[0]=1$\n$dp[1]=1$\n$dp[2]=1$\n$dp[3]=2$\n$dp[4]=3$\n$dp[5]=5$\nThe sequence is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$. This is $F_{n+1}$ from standard Fibonacci $(0,1,1,2,3,5,\\dots)$ for $n \\ge 3$, but $dp[0], dp[1], dp[2]$ are different.\nFor $n=1$, $dp[1]=1$.\nFor $n=2$, $dp[2]=1$.\nFor $n \\ge 3$, $dp[n]$ is the $(n+1)$-th Fibonacci number (if $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\nSo $dp[n] = \\text{fib}(n+1)$ for $n \\ge 3$.\n$dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[2]=1$.\nThe problem constraints are $1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nSo for $n=1$, result is $1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\nFor $n=2$, result is $1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nFor $n \\ge 3$, result is $F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\n\nThis is the sequence from OEIS A000045, shifted.\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$\nThe sequence $dp[n]$ is for $n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \\dots$\n$1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$\nThis is $F_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 3$.\nIt is $F_2$ for $n=1,2$.\nSo, for $n=1,2$, the answer is $F_2 \\cdot (1/2)^n = 1 \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\nFor $n \\ge 3$, the answer is $F_{n+1} \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\n\nThis can be computed efficiently using matrix exponentiation for Fibonacci numbers.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe need $F_{n+1}$.
