A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thought process for tackling this \"Soft Drinking\" problem:**\n\nFirst, I identified the key input variables: the number of friends (`n`), the drink-related quantities (`k`, `l`, `nl`), the lime-related quantities (`c`, `d`), and the salt-related quantities (`p`, `np`).  The goal is to maximize the number of toasts (`T`) each friend can make, ensuring everyone has the same number.\n\nI quickly realized that the constraints are straightforward: all inputs are positive integers within a reasonable range (1 to 1000), making integer division suitable and worrying about overflow unnecessary.\n\nI then started calculating the resources. I first considered how much drink we had (`k * l`), how many lime slices (`c * d`) and how much salt (`p`). Next, and here’s where the key interpretation comes in, is calculating \"group toasts\". This means, I considered how many \"group toasts\" could be made based on each resource, where a \"group toast\" represents one toast made by each friend simultaneously.  For drink, it became `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.  For limes, it's `(c * d) // n`, and for salt, it's `p // (n * np)`.  The integer division is crucial because you can't have fractional toasts.\n\nThe *minimum* of these three calculated \"group toasts\" is the answer. This ensures that we don't run out of any resource.  Mathematically, this aligns with the problem statement of \"each friend make the same amount\". I tested this logic with the provided examples and it worked perfectly.\n\nFinally, I wrote the Python code. I imported the `sys` module for reading input and used `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)` to parse the input efficiently. I calculated the `group_toasts` for each resource and then, with the `min()` function, got the answer.  After a final review for edge cases, variable names, clarity, and confirming the arithmetic, I was confident in my solution.\n",
