The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving Xenia's Ringroad Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to solve the \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break this down. We're given the number of houses (`n`), the number of tasks (`m`), and an array `a` where `a_i` represents the house where the i-th task needs to be done. Xenia starts at house 1 and has to complete tasks in order. Movement is clockwise, one house at a time, and the goal is to find the minimum total time.\n\nI can represent Xenia's current house and the total time. I'll iterate through the tasks. For each task, I calculate the time it takes to get from the current house to the target house. There are two cases here: If the target house number is greater than or equal to the current house number, it's a direct move clockwise, and the time is just the difference. But if the target is less than the current house, it's a wrap-around case, where she goes all the way to house `n` and then back around. I've worked out that the time for this wrap-around is `n - current_house + target_house`.\n\nI've tested this logic with a few examples, and the output seems correct.\n\nI need to make sure I'm using an appropriate data type for the total time, because the values could get quite large. Luckily, Python automatically handles integers of arbitrary size, so I don't need to worry about overflow.\n\nTo implement, I will read the inputs, initialize `current_house` to 1 and `total_time` to 0. Inside the loop, I'll calculate `time_taken` based on the two cases described earlier, add that to `total_time`, and then update `current_house`. Finally, I'll print the `total_time`. I will use the `sys` module for faster I/O.\n\nOkay, let's write the code, double-check it, and submit!\n",
