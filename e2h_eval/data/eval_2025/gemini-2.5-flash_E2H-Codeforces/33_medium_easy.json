You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. My goal is to craft a Python script that efficiently maximizes a number 'a' by replacing its digits with digits from a sequence 's'.**\n\nFirst, I need to really understand the problem. I'm given 'a' and 's' as strings of digits.  I can swap a digit in 'a' with a digit from 's', but each digit in 's' can be used only once. The challenge is to make 'a' as large as possible.  I don't have to use all the digits from 's', which is key.\n\nMy core strategy is to maximize the *leftmost* digits of 'a' first.  This is the standard greedy approach. I'll scan 'a' from left to right. For each digit in 'a', I want to find the *largest* digit in 's' that's bigger than the current digit in 'a'.\n\nI've sketched out a detailed plan.  I'll read 'a' and 's' as strings. To make the searching easy, I'll sort the digits in 's' in descending order. Then, I'll convert 'a' into a modifiable list of characters.  I will iterate through 'a', digit by digit. For each digit in 'a', I'll scan the sorted digits from 's' (largest to smallest) looking for a replacement.  If I find a bigger digit, I swap, mark the 's' digit as used, and move to the next digit in 'a'.\n\nI thought about using a list with removal, but that would be too slow. A *frequency map* is much faster. It's essentially a count array, `s_counts`, of size 10 to represent all possible digits (0-9). As I read the input sequence 's', I increment the count for each digit in `s_counts`.\n\nNow, I'll use the frequency map in my improved plan.  I'll convert 'a' to a list. Iterate through each digit in 'a', then check the `s_counts` to see if a bigger digit exists. If so, I'll replace the digit and decrement the corresponding count. This frequency map approach optimizes the search and avoids the slow removal operations.\n\nLet's work through an example. For `a = \"1024\"` and `s = \"010\"`, `s_counts = [2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nFor the first digit in 'a', '1', I check for any digit in 's' greater than '1'.  I start from 9 and go down. I find '1', so I decrement `s_counts[1]` to 0, which means no digit gets replaced. Move on to '0', and try to find a number great than 0, then '2', and finally '4'. In this case, I will replace '0' with '1'. The result is `1124`.\n\nI ran through the math. I need to make sure this revised approach is efficient enough, especially for large inputs.  After some analysis, I'm confident that the frequency map makes this `O(n + m)` (n = length of 'a', m = length of 's') which is good.  No time complexity issues will arise!\n\nI also verified the edge cases. I needed to ensure there won't be issues if the new number has leading zeros. This case is handled appropriately due to the problem restrictions. I now have the full Python code, which should be correct and optimized. I've double-checked my examples and also run through the code in my head. I'm ready to submit it!\n",
