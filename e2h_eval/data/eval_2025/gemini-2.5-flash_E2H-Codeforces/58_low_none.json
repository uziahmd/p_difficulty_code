You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Vitaly and Cycle**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Vitaly and Cycle\" problem, and the core of it is finding the fewest edges to add to a graph to make an odd-length cycle. I see the constraints: up to 100,000 vertices and edges, so efficiency is key. My initial thought is a solution that is O(N+M) or perhaps O((N+M) log N).\n\nThe crucial point here is the concept of an odd cycle. I know a graph has an odd cycle *if and only if* it's not bipartite. That's a huge clue! To start, I need to check for this property in the given graph.\n\nMy immediate plan is to use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) for 2-coloring each connected component. I'll assign colors (say, 0 and 1) to vertices as I explore. If I find a conflict during the 2-coloring process – an edge connects two vertices of the same color – I've got an odd cycle already! In that case, `t = 0` and `w = 1`, and I'm done with the problem. I'll just need to iterate through all connected components to verify the graph doesn't have any odd cycle already.\n\nNow, if the graph turns out to be bipartite, I need to consider adding edges. I need to get `t=1` . Adding one edge to a bipartite graph has a very specific consequence.  Let's say I add an edge (u, v). This will create an odd cycle IF and only if both `u` and `v` are in the *same* connected component and have the *same* color in the 2-coloring. If they are in different components, or in the same component but with opposite colors, then adding this edge does *not* create an odd cycle.\n\nSo, for `t = 1`, I'll check for such pairs within the 2-colored graph. The number of such valid edges is `w`. I'll need to calculate this carefully, keeping in mind that any pair should be in the same connected component and same color. I'm thinking of how to do this in an efficient manner, potentially by iterating through the colored components and counting pairs of same-colored vertices.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w`, the number of ways to do so.\n\nA graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. This property is central to solving the problem. We can determine if a graph is bipartite by attempting to 2-color its connected components using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for `t`:\n\n**1. `t = 0` (Graph already contains an odd cycle)**\nWe iterate through all connected components of the graph. For each unvisited vertex, we start a BFS/DFS to traverse its component and attempt to 2-color it.\n- Assign a starting vertex color 0.\n- When traversing an edge `(u, v)`:\n    - If `v` is unvisited, assign `v` the opposite color of `u` and add it to the queue/stack.\n    - If `v` is visited:\n        - If `color(u) == color(v)`, we have found an edge connecting two vertices of the same color. This means the graph is not bipartite, and an odd cycle already exists. In this case, `t = 0` and `w = 1` (any existing odd cycle is a valid way). We can stop immediately and print `0 1`.\n\nIf we successfully 2-color all connected components without any conflicts, the graph is bipartite, and `t` must be at least 1.\n\n**2. `t = 1` (Graph is bipartite, one edge addition forms an odd cycle)**\nSince the graph is bipartite, we have successfully 2-colored all its components. Let's say vertices are colored 0 or 1.\nAn odd cycle can be formed by adding a single edge `(u, v)` if and only if `u` and `v` are in the same connected component and `color(u) == color(v)`.\nIf such an edge can be added, `t = 1`.\nTo find `w`, we need to count how many pairs `(u, v)` satisfy these conditions.\nFor each connected component `C_i`:\nLet `N_0_i` be the count of vertices in `C_i` with color 0.\nLet `N_1_i` be the count of vertices in `C_i` with color 1.\nThe number of ways to choose two distinct vertices of the same color within `C_i` is `N_0_i * (N_0_i - 1) / 2` (for color 0) plus `N_1_i * (N_1_i - 1) / 2` (for color 1).\nThe total number of ways `w` for `t = 1` is the sum of these counts over all components:\n`w = sum( N_0_i * (N_0_i - 1) / 2 + N_1_i * (N_1_i - 1) / 2 )` for all components `C_i`.\nIf `w > 0`, then `t = 1`. Print `1 w`.\n\n**3. `t = 2` (Graph is bipartite, no single edge forms an odd cycle, but two edges can)**\nIf `t` is not 0 or 1, it means the graph is bipartite, and adding any single edge `(u, v)` (where `u` and `v` are in the same component) would connect vertices of different colors, forming an even cycle. This implies that for every component `C_i`, either `N_0_i` or `N_1_i` (or both) must be less than 2. In other words, all `N_0_i * (N_0_i - 1) / 2` and `N_1_i * (N_1_i - 1) / 2` terms were 0. This happens if all components are paths or stars where one partition has at most one vertex (e.g., a path graph, or a single vertex). More generally, it means `N_0_i < 2` and `N_1_i < 2` for all components. This is only possible if all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\nHowever, the condition `t=1` failing means that no two vertices of the same color exist within any component. This is possible if all components are trees where each partition has at most one vertex. This is wrong. `t=1` failing means that for every component, if we pick two vertices of the same color, they are already connected by an edge. Wait, no. `t=1` failing means that there are no two vertices `u, v` of the same color in the same component such that `(u, v)` is *not* an existing edge. The logic above for `t=1` counts pairs `(u,v)` of same color in same component. If `w=0` for `t=1`, it means no such pair exists. This implies that for every component `C_i`, `N_0_i < 2` and `N_1_i < 2`. This implies each component has at most 2 vertices, and if it has 2 vertices, they must be of different colors, i.e., a single edge.\nThis is incorrect reasoning. `t=1` fails if *all* possible pairs `(u, v)` such that `u, v` are in the same component and `color(u) == color(v)` are *already* existing edges. This is highly unlikely for general bipartite graphs.\nThe condition for `t=1` is simply `w > 0`. If `w` from step 2 is 0, it means there are no two distinct vertices `u, v` in the same component with `color(u) == color(v)` such that `(u,v)` is *not* an existing edge. This is equivalent to saying that for every component, `N_0_i <= 1` and `N_1_i <= 1`. This is only true if every connected component is either an isolated vertex or a single edge.\nIf this is the case, `t` cannot be 1.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `t=1`. If `w=0` in step 2, it means that for every component `C_i`, `N_0_i * (N_0_i - 1) / 2 + N_1_i * (N_1_i - 1) / 2 = 0`. This implies `N_0_i < 2` and `N_1_i < 2` for all components. This means each component `C_i` has at most one vertex of color 0 and at most one vertex of color 1. So, each component is either an isolated vertex or a single edge.\nIn this specific case (all components are isolated vertices or single edges), we cannot form an odd cycle by adding one edge within a component.\nHowever, we can form an odd cycle by connecting two *different* components.\nSuppose we have two distinct components `C_a` and `C_b`. We can pick any vertex `u` from `C_a` and any vertex `v` from `C_b`. Adding an edge `(u, v)` connects these two components. Since `C_a` and `C_b` are bipartite, the resulting graph is still bipartite. No odd cycle is formed.\nTherefore, `t=1` cannot be skipped entirely. If the graph is bipartite, `t=1` is always possible unless `n < 3`.\nThe only way `t=1` fails is if `n < 3`.\nIf `n < 3`, we can't form a cycle of length 3 or more.\nIf `n=1`, `t=3` (e.g., add `(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)` to form a 3-cycle using new vertices 2,3). `w=1`.\nIf `n=2`, `t=3` (e.g., add `(1,3), (3,2), (2,1)` using new vertex 3). `w=1`.\nThese cases are covered by `t=3`.\n\nLet's assume `n >= 3`.\nIf `t=0` fails, the graph is bipartite.\nIf there are *any* two vertices `u, v` in the same component with `color(u) == color(v)`, and `(u, v)` is not an existing edge, then `t=1`. The `w` for this case is calculated as `sum( N_0_i * (N_0_i - 1) / 2 + N_1_i * (N_1_i - 1) / 2 )`.\nThis `w` will be non-zero if there is at least one component `C_i` with `N_0_i >= 2` or `N_1_i >= 2`.\n\nWhat if `w` calculated for `t=1` is 0? This means for all components `C_i`, `N_0_i < 2` AND `N_1_i < 2`.\nThis implies that every connected component is either:\n- An isolated vertex (e.g., `N_0=1, N_1=0` or `N_0=0, N_1=1`).\n- A single edge (e.g., `N_0=1, N_1=1`).\nIn this scenario, we cannot form an odd cycle by adding an edge within an existing component. We must connect vertices from different components.\nIf we add an edge `(u, v)` where `u` is in `C_a` and `v` is in `C_b` (`C_a != C_b`), the graph remains bipartite. No odd cycle is formed.\nTo form an odd cycle, we need to add edges that connect two \"sides\" of the bipartite graph.\nSpecifically, if we have two components `C_a` and `C_b`, we can pick `u` from `C_a` (say, `color(u)=0`) and `v` from `C_b` (say, `color(v)=0`). Adding `(u, v)` still doesn't create an odd cycle.\nAn odd cycle requires an odd number of edges. If we add `k` edges, the resulting graph `G'` must be non-bipartite.\nConsider adding two edges `(u, v)` and `(v, w)` and `(w, u)`. This is a 3-cycle.\nIf `t=1` is not possible (i.e., `w=0` from previous step), then all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\nTo form an odd cycle, we need to connect at least 3 vertices.\nWe can pick any three distinct vertices `u, v, x`. If we add edges `(u, v), (v, x), (x, u)`, we form a 3-cycle. This requires 3 edges.\nSo, if `t=1` is not possible, then `t` must be at least 2.\n\nLet's re-examine `t=2`.\nIf `t=1` failed (meaning `w` for `t=1` was 0), then all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\nIn this case, we need to add at least two edges to form an odd cycle.\nConsider adding two edges `(u, v)` and `(v, x)` such that `u, v, x` form an odd cycle. This is not enough. We need to add `(u,v), (v,x), (x,u)`. This is 3 edges.\nWhat if we add two edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)`? This will not form an odd cycle unless `u,v,x,y` are related.\nThe only way to form an odd cycle with 2 added edges is if the original graph has a path `P` of some length, and we add two edges `(u,v)` and `(v,w)` to form a cycle `u-P-v-w-u`. This cycle will be odd if `length(P) + 2` is odd, which means `length(P)` must be odd.\nIf we have a bipartite graph, a path `P` between `u` and `v` has length `L`. `u` and `v` have different colors if `L` is odd, and same colors if `L` is even.\nIf `t=1` failed, it means `N_0_i < 2` and `N_1_i < 2` for all components. So, all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\nIn this specific case, we cannot find a path of odd length between two vertices of the same color.\nWe also cannot find a path of even length between two vertices of different colors.\nNo, this is not right. A path `u-v` in a bipartite graph always has `color(u) != color(v)` if path length is odd, and `color(u) == color(v)` if path length is even.\nIf `t=1` fails, it means for all components `C_i`, `N_0_i < 2` and `N_1_i < 2`.\nThis means each component is either:\n- A single vertex (e.g., `v_1`). Color `v_1` as 0. `N_0=1, N_1=0`.\n- A single edge (e.g., `v_1-v_2`). Color `v_1` as 0, `v_2` as 1. `N_0=1, N_1=1`.\nIn this situation, any path between two distinct vertices `u,v` must have length 1 (if they are connected by an edge) or be non-existent.\nSo, if `t=1` fails, we must add at least two edges to form an odd cycle.\nThe smallest odd cycle is a 3-cycle. To form a 3-cycle `u-v-x-u`, we need 3 vertices.\nIf we have 3 isolated vertices `u, v, x`, we add 3 edges. `t=3`. `w=1` (one way to choose these 3 vertices).\nIf we have `n` vertices, all isolated: `t=3`. We pick 3 vertices out of `n`, `C(n,3)` ways. `w = C(n,3)`.\nIf `n=0,1,2`, we cannot form a 3-cycle. The problem states \"more than one vertex\".\nIf `n < 3`, `t=3` and `w=1` (implicitly, we pick 3 new vertices, or use existing ones if `n=2` and one new). This is a bit ambiguous. \"consisting of more than one vertex\" means cycle length >= 2. Odd length means length >= 3. So `n` must be at least 3 for a cycle using only existing vertices.\nThe problem states \"add edges to the given graph\". It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges. It does not explicitly prohibit adding vertices. However, competitive programming problems usually imply using existing vertices unless stated otherwise. Given `n` up to `10^5`, adding new vertices would make `n` dynamic, which is usually not the case. Let's assume we only use existing `n` vertices.\n\nIf `n < 3`:\n- If `n=0, 1, 2`, it's impossible to form a 3-cycle using only existing vertices.\n- For `n=0, 1, 2`, the problem statement implies we *must* form such a cycle. This means we must introduce new vertices.\n  - If `n=0`, we need 3 new vertices. `t=3`, `w=1`.\n  - If `n=1`, we need 2 new vertices. `t=3`, `w=1`.\n  - If `n=2`, we need 1 new vertex. `t=3`, `w=1`.\nThis is a standard competitive programming interpretation: if `n` is too small, we introduce new vertices. The number of ways is 1 because the choice of new vertices is canonical.\n\nSo, the logic for `t` and `w` is as follows:\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  **Initialize:**\n    - `color` array of size `n+1`, initialized to -1 (unvisited).\n    - `adj` list for graph.\n    - `is_bipartite = True`.\n    - `ways_t1 = 0` (ways for `t=1`).\n    - `num_components = 0`.\n    - `total_nodes_in_bipartite_components = 0`.\n\n2.  **Iterate through vertices `i` from 1 to `n`:**\n    - If `color[i]` is -1 (vertex `i` is unvisited):\n        - Increment `num_components`.\n        - Start a BFS from `i`:\n            - `q = deque([(i, 0)])` (vertex, color).\n            - `color[i] = 0`.\n            - `count_color0 = 1`, `count_color1 = 0`.\n            - `component_nodes = 1`.\n            - While `q` is not empty:\n                - `u, c_u = q.popleft()`.\n                - For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n                    - If `color[v]` is -1:\n                        - `color[v] = 1 - c_u`.\n                        - If `1 - c_u == 0`, `count_color0 += 1`. Else `count_color1 += 1`.\n                        - `component_nodes += 1`.\n                        - `q.append((v, 1 - c_u))`.\n                    - Else if `color[v] == c_u`:\n                        - `is_bipartite = False`.\n                        - (We can break early if `t=0` is found, but for `t=1` calculation, we need to complete the BFS to count `N_0, N_1` for the current component if `is_bipartite` is still true).\n                        - For now, let's keep `is_bipartite` flag and continue. If it becomes false, we'll return `0 1`.\n            - If `is_bipartite` is still true after this component's BFS:\n                - Add ways for `t=1` for this component: `ways_t1 += (count_color0 * (count_color0 - 1) // 2)`.\n                - `ways_t1 += (count_color1 * (count_color1 - 1) // 2)`.\n                - `total_nodes_in_bipartite_components += component_nodes`.\n\n3.  **Determine `t` and `w` based on results:**\n    - If `is_bipartite` is `False`:\n        - `t = 0`, `w = 1`. Print `0 1`.\n    - Else (`is_bipartite` is `True`):\n        - If `ways_t1 > 0`:\n            - `t = 1`, `w = ways_t1`. Print `1 w`.\n        - Else (`ways_t1 == 0`):\n            - This means all connected components are either isolated vertices or single edges.\n            - We need to add at least 2 edges to form an odd cycle.\n            - To form a 3-cycle `u-v-x-u`, we need 3 vertices.\n            - **Case `t=2`**:\n                - We can form an odd cycle of length 3 by picking two distinct isolated vertices `u, v` (or vertices from single-edge components) and adding edges `(u, v)` and `(u, w)` and `(v, w)` where `w` is a new vertex. This means `t=2` is not possible using only existing vertices.\n                - We are looking for an odd cycle using only existing vertices. If `ways_t1 = 0`, it means all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\n                - To form an odd cycle of length 3, we need three distinct vertices `u, v, x`. We add edges `(u,v), (v,x), (x,u)`. This requires 3 edges.\n                - Can we form an odd cycle with 2 edges? No.\n                - The minimum number of edges to add to a bipartite graph to make it non-bipartite is 1 (if `ways_t1 > 0`). If `ways_t1 == 0`, it means we cannot find two vertices of the same color within the same component.\n                - If `ways_t1 == 0`, it means all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\n                - We need to connect three vertices `u, v, x` to form a 3-cycle.\n                - The number of vertices `n` must be at least 3.\n                - The number of ways to pick 3 distinct vertices from `n` is `n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6`.\n                - This is the number of ways to form a 3-cycle if all vertices are isolated.\n                - If there are `k` components, and `N` total vertices, the number of ways to pick 2 vertices from different components is `N * (N-1) / 2 - sum(N_i * (N_i-1)/2)` for intra-component pairs.\n                - Let's consider the total number of vertices `N`. The number of ways to add 2 edges to form an odd cycle is `N * (N-1) / 2 - M` (total possible edges minus existing edges). No, this is not how `t=2` works.\n                - If `t=1` fails, it means we cannot connect two vertices of the same color within a component.\n                - We need to add two edges `(u,v)` and `(v,w)` such that `u,v,w` form an odd cycle.\n                - This means `u` and `w` must be in the same component, and `color(u) == color(w)`. But this would mean `t=1`.\n                - So, `t=2` can only happen if we connect two different components.\n                - Consider two components `C_a` and `C_b`. Pick `u` from `C_a` and `v` from `C_b`. Add edge `(u,v)`. The graph is still bipartite.\n                - Now pick `x` from `C_a` (same component as `u`) and `y` from `C_b` (same component as `v`).\n                - Add `(u,y)` and `(v,x)`. This forms a 4-cycle `u-y-v-x-u`. This is an even cycle.\n                - We need an odd cycle.\n                - The only way to get an odd cycle with two edges added to a bipartite graph is if the two added edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)` connect vertices such that `u,x` are in one partition and `v,y` are in another, and then `u,v,x,y` are related.\n                - This is getting complicated. Let's simplify.\n                - If `t=1` fails, it means all components are isolated vertices or single edges.\n                - Then we have `n` vertices, and `m` edges. `m <= n/2`.\n                - To form an odd cycle, we need to pick 3 vertices `u,v,x`.\n                - If `u,v,x` are all isolated, we add 3 edges. `t=3`.\n                - If `u-v` is an edge, and `x` is isolated, we add `(v,x)` and `(x,u)`. This is 2 edges. This forms a 3-cycle `u-v-x-u`.\n                - So, `t=2` is possible if there exists at least one edge `(u,v)` and at least one isolated vertex `x`.\n                - Number of ways `w` for `t=2`:\n                    - Count `num_edges` (existing edges `m`).\n                    - Count `num_isolated_vertices` (`n - 2 * num_edges`).\n                    - If `num_edges > 0` and `num_isolated_vertices > 0`:\n                        - `w = num_edges * num_isolated_vertices`. (Pick an existing edge `(u,v)`, pick an isolated vertex `x`. Add `(u,x)` and `(v,x)` to form `u-v-x-u`.)\n                        - This assumes `n >= 3`.\n                        - This is the number of ways to pick an edge and an isolated vertex. Each such pick leads to one way of adding two edges.\n                        - Print `2 w`.\n                - This logic for `t=2` only covers forming a 3-cycle by adding two edges to an existing edge and an isolated vertex.\n                - What if there are no isolated vertices (all components are single edges)? Then `num_isolated_vertices = 0`.\n                - What if there are no edges (all components are isolated vertices)? Then `num_edges = 0`.\n                - In these cases, `w` for `t=2` would be 0.\n            - **Case `t=3`**:\n                - If `t=2` fails (i.e., `num_edges * num_isolated_vertices == 0`), it means either all vertices are isolated or all vertices are part of single edges.\n                - If all vertices are isolated (`m=0`):\n                    - We need to pick 3 distinct vertices `u,v,x`. Add `(u,v), (v,x), (x,u)`.\n                    - `t=3`.\n                    - `w = n * (n-1) * (n-2) // 6`.\n                    - This requires `n >= 3`. If `n < 3`, we cannot form a 3-cycle using only existing vertices. In this case, `w=1` (implicitly adding new vertices).\n                - If all vertices are part of single edges (`n` is even, `m=n/2`):\n                    - We need to pick 3 vertices `u,v,x`.\n                    - If `u-v` and `v-x` are edges, adding `(x,u)` makes `u-v-x-u` (3-cycle). This is `t=1` (connecting same-color nodes).\n                    - No, this is wrong. If `u-v` and `v-x` are edges, then `u` and `x` are in the same component, and `color(u) == color(x)`. So `t=1` would have been found.\n                    - So we must pick 3 vertices from different components.\n                    - Pick 3 vertices `u,v,x`. Add `(u,v), (v,x), (x,u)`.\n                    - `t=3`.\n                    - `w = n * (n-1) * (n-2) // 6`.\n                    - This is always `n * (n-1) * (n-2) // 6` ways if `n >= 3`.\n                    - If `n < 3`, `w=1`.\n            - So, if `ways_t1 == 0` (all components are isolated vertices or single edges):\n                - If `n < 3`:\n                    - `t = 3`, `w = 1`.\n                - Else (`n >= 3`):\n                    - `num_edges = m`.\n                    - `num_isolated_vertices = n - 2 * num_edges`.\n                    - If `num_edges > 0` and `num_isolated_vertices > 0`:\n                        - `t = 2`.\n                        - `w = num_edges * num_isolated_vertices`.\n                    - Else (`num_edges = 0` OR `num_isolated_vertices = 0`):\n                        - `t = 3`.\n                        - `w = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.\n\n**Example Walkthroughs:**\n\n*   **Example 1: `4 4`, `(1,2), (1,3), (4,2), (4,3)`**\n    - `adj`: `1:[2,3], 2:[1,4], 3:[1,4], 4:[2,3]`\n    - Start BFS from 1:\n        - `color[1]=0`. `q=[(1,0)]`. `c0=1, c1=0`.\n        - Pop `(1,0)`.
