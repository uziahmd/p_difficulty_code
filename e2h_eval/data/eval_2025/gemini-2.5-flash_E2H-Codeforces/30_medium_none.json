Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"TV Game\" problem and figure out the best way to solve it.** It seems like we've got a competitive programming challenge where two players, Homer and Marge, are trying to maximize the sum of two numbers (S1 and S2) built from the digits of a larger number, A. The key is that they take turns picking the leftmost digits, with Homer getting S1 and Marge getting S2, and both players are limited to 'n' moves.\n\n**The heart of the problem is realizing that the positions of the digits within S1 and S2 drastically affect their contribution to the total sum.** A digit taken earlier gets multiplied by a higher power of 10, significantly increasing its value.  We've got the constraint that `n` is small, up to 18. This is huge, because it means we can probably get away with a dynamic programming (DP) approach.\n\n**The total prize is S1+S2. Each turn, a digit is chosen. This hints at recursion and optimal substructure.**  We need a way to decide for each digit whether Homer or Marge should take it.  Let's define a DP state: `dp(k, h_count, m_count)` represents the maximum prize achievable considering digits starting from the k-th digit in the original number A, given that Homer has made `h_count` moves and Marge has made `m_count` moves.\n\n**The DP logic then boils down to a recursive choice:** we look at the current digit, and if a player still has moves available, we calculate the prize if that player takes it. We recursively call `dp` for the next digit and the updated move counts. The state transition is simply:  `max_prize = max(prize_if_homer_takes, prize_if_marge_takes)`. We want to build the `choice` array which gives us the final output `HMHHMM`.\n\n**Now, let's optimize this:** we'll memoize the results of the `dp` function to avoid redundant calculations. We'll precompute the powers of 10 (`pow10`) to speed things up. It's a classical DP problem with a state space that is manageable given the small `n` constraint. I'm feeling confident we can get this to work efficiently with the right implementation details.\n",
