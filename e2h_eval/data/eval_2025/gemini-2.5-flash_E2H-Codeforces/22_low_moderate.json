After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Problem Solving Strategy for \"Marks\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Marks\" problem. It seems straightforward, but let's break it down methodically.  The core of it is determining which students are \"successful\" based on their marks in various subjects. I've got `n` students and `m` subjects, with marks ranging from 1 to 9. A student is considered \"best\" in a subject if no other student scored higher in *that particular subject*.  A student is \"successful\" if they are the best in *at least one* subject. The ultimate goal is to count the successful students.\n\nThe input format is clear: `n` and `m` on the first line, followed by `n` lines, each representing a student's marks across `m` subjects.  The output is simply the count of successful students. The constraints are reasonable, keeping `n` and `m` within 100, which means brute-force or a slightly optimized approach should be sufficient.\n\nAnalyzing the provided example, I can see the pattern. First, I need to identify the maximum mark for each subject. Then, for each subject, I need to determine which students achieved that maximum mark. If a student is the best in at least one subject, they are considered successful.\n\nThe algorithm I'm formulating in my head involves a few key steps. First, I'll read the input and store the marks in a suitable data structure. A list of lists or a list of strings will be perfect for this. Let's call it `gradebook`.  Next, I'll iterate through each subject, comparing the marks of all students to find the maximum mark for each subject. Then, I'll keep track of the indices of the students who have that maximum mark. Finally, I'll iterate through the students and check if they are the best in at least one subject. A set called `successful_students_indices` will be ideal for storing the indices of the successful students, ensuring no duplicates. The size of this set will then provide the final count.  Comparing characters directly should work because the digits '1' to '9' are ordered correctly in ASCII. I don't need to do any unnecessary conversions.\n",
