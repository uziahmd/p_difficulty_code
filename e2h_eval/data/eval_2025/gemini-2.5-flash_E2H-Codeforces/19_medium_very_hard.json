The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Greedy Subtree Selection for Maximum Fan Count**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're given a tree, and the goal is to choose a connected subgraph of a specific size (n-k), maximizing the sum of fan counts, where each district's fan count is a power of 2 (2^i). The core insight is that because the powers of 2 grow rapidly, we always want to include districts with larger indices. It's essentially a greedy problem: Keep the districts with the highest indices, so long as connectivity is maintained.\n\nWe need to remove 'k' districts, leaving us with a connected subgraph of 'n-k' districts.  The problem is now figuring out how to do this in a way that prioritizes the highest indices. Trying to add nodes greedily seems problematic because adding one high-index node might prevent us from adding another one later, if connectivity is lost.\n\nRemoving nodes also seems tricky, although removing the smallest-indexed nodes *might* seem promising, it won't necessarily lead to the highest fan count. Removing low-index nodes could disconnect the graph in a way that prevents us from forming a large sum with larger nodes.\n\nThe crux is about finding this optimal subtree. If you view the problem as keeping the largest possible node, that node is the *root* of our solution.  So, we must look for a subtree containing that largest node as the root.  This means we want to find a subtree with size (n-k), and the root node is as large as possible.  Other nodes in this subtree should be chosen from the other available (not removed) high-indexed nodes.\n\nThis looks like an iterative approach where we consider the nodes from the largest (n) down to 1. For each node, we greedily try to add it, but only if it maintains connectivity to our currently-formed component. The key is in determining whether adding a node creates a connected component.  The ideal solution hinges on finding an efficient connectivity check at each step of this greedy process.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts to participate in The Number Games, such that these `n-k` districts form a connected component in the given tree structure. We want to maximize the total number of fans, where district `i` has `2^i` fans.\n\nThe key observation is that `2^i` grows very rapidly. Specifically, `2^N > \\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} 2^j`. This means that to maximize the sum of fans, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. If we can keep district `N`, we absolutely should, regardless of what other districts it forces us to keep (as long as the total count is `n-k`). Similarly, if we can keep `N` and `N-1`, we should, and so on. This implies a greedy strategy: we want to find a connected component of size `n-k` that contains the largest possible indices.\n\nLet `N_keep = n-k` be the number of districts we must keep.\nWe want to find a set `S` of `N_keep` districts such that `S` induces a connected subgraph and `sum_{i \\in S} 2^i` is maximized.\n\nThe greedy approach is as follows:\n1. We iterate through the districts from `n` down to `1`.\n2. We maintain a set `kept_nodes` of districts we have decided to keep, and a count of `num_kept` districts.\n3. We also maintain a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. Each set in the DSU will represent a connected component of `kept_nodes` (or a potential component if it contains nodes not yet in `kept_nodes`). For each set, we need to know its size and the number of `kept_nodes` it contains.\n\nHowever, a simpler greedy approach works:\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. To maximize the sum of `2^i` for the remaining nodes, we should remove the `k` nodes with the smallest possible indices, *provided that the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component*.\n\nLet's maintain a set of nodes that are currently \"active\" and could potentially be part of the final connected component. Initially, all nodes are active.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. We iterate through nodes from `1` to `n`. For each node `u`, we try to remove it. If removing `u` does not disconnect the graph of *active* nodes, and we still need to remove more nodes, we remove `u`.\n\nThis can be implemented efficiently using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure.\n1. Initialize a DSU structure for `n` nodes. Each node `i` is initially in its own set.\n2. We will process nodes from `n` down to `1`.\n3. For each node `u` (from `n` down to `1`):\n    a. Mark `u` as \"active\" (meaning it is potentially part of our final component).\n    b. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        If `v` is also active, unite the sets containing `u` and `v` in the DSU.\n    c. After processing all neighbors, the set containing `u` in the DSU now represents a connected component of active nodes. Let `root_u` be the representative of this set. We need to keep track of the size of this component (`dsu_size[root_u]`).\n    d. We also need to know how many nodes we have currently decided to keep. Let `kept_count` be this number.\n\nThe strategy is to build the connected component starting from the largest labeled nodes.\nLet `kept_nodes` be the set of nodes we keep.\nLet `removed_nodes` be the list of nodes we remove.\nWe use a DSU structure to keep track of connected components among the nodes we are *considering* to keep.\nFor each node `u`, we also need to store the number of \"kept\" nodes in its DSU component.\n\nA more direct greedy approach for removing nodes:\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. To maximize the sum, we should remove the smallest `k` nodes, as long as the remaining `n-k` nodes are connected.\nThis is a standard problem: find `k` nodes to remove to keep the remaining `n-k` nodes connected, maximizing the sum of values.\nThe nodes to keep must form a connected component.\nConsider the nodes in decreasing order: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to select `N_keep = n-k` nodes.\nLet `selected_nodes` be the set of nodes we decide to keep.\nLet `removed_nodes` be the set of nodes we decide to remove.\nWe iterate `u` from `n` down to `1`.\nIf `u` is not already in `selected_nodes`:\n  If `len(selected_nodes) < N_keep`:\n    If `selected_nodes` is empty, we must add `u` (it's the largest, so it's the \"root\" of our component).\n    If `selected_nodes` is not empty:\n      Check if `u` is adjacent to any node in `selected_nodes`. If it is, add `u` to `selected_nodes`.\n      If `u` is not adjacent to any node in `selected_nodes`, then `u` cannot be added *right now* while maintaining connectivity with the current `selected_nodes`. In this case, `u` is a candidate for removal.\n      This logic is flawed because `selected_nodes` might not yet be complete.\n\nThe correct greedy approach is based on the idea of removing nodes.\nWe maintain the set of nodes that are *still in consideration* (not yet removed).\nWhen we consider a node `u` (from `1` to `n`):\nIf `u` is a leaf node in the current graph of *unremoved* nodes, and we still need to remove nodes (`k > 0`), then we can remove `u`. Removing a leaf node does not disconnect the graph.\nThis is not quite right. A leaf node in the *original* tree might not be a leaf in the current graph.\n\nThe problem can be solved by iterating through nodes from `n` down to `1`. We identify `n-k` nodes to keep.\nWe use a DSU structure to keep track of connectivity among the *kept* nodes.\n`parent`: DSU parent array.\n`comp_size`: size of the component (number of nodes in the DSU set).\n`num_kept_in_comp`: number of nodes *kept* in a DSU set.\n`adj`: adjacency list of the graph.\n`kept_nodes`: a boolean array, `kept_nodes[i]` is true if node `i` is kept.\n`removed_list`: list of nodes to be removed.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `parent` array for DSU: `parent[i] = i`.\n2. Initialize `comp_size[i] = 1` for all `i`.\n3. Initialize `kept_nodes[i] = False` for all `i`.\n4. Initialize `num_active_components = 0`. This will count components of currently kept nodes.\n5. `num_kept = 0`.\n6. Iterate `u` from `n` down to `1`:\n   a. Mark `u` as `kept_nodes[u] = True`. Increment `num_kept`.\n   b. `num_active_components += 1` (initially, `u` forms its own component).\n   c. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n      If `kept_nodes[v]` is `True` (meaning `v` is already kept):\n         If `find(u) != find(v)` (they are in different components):\n            `unite(u, v)`. `num_active_components -= 1`.\n   d. If `num_kept == n - k`: We have selected `n-k` nodes. These nodes form a connected component if `num_active_components == 1`.\n      If `num_active_components == 1`, we are done. The `kept_nodes` are those marked `True`. The `removed_list` should contain all other nodes.\n      If `num_active_components > 1`, this means our current set of `n-k` kept nodes is not connected. This specific greedy strategy isn't sufficient.\n\nThe correct approach for this type of greedy problem on trees is often to process nodes in reverse order of their IDs (from `n` down to `1`), using a DSU to manage connected components.\nThe `num_kept_in_comp` for each DSU set is crucial.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nLet `removed_count = 0`.\nLet `kept_nodes_set` be the set of nodes we keep.\nIterate `u` from `n` down to `1`:\n  Add `u` to `kept_nodes_set`.\n  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n    If `v` is in `kept_nodes_set`:\n      Union `u` and `v` in DSU.\n  While `len(kept_nodes_set) > n - k`:\n    We need to remove a node from `kept_nodes_set`. Which one? The smallest-indexed one that we added.\n    This means we need to \"undo\" adding the smallest node.\n    This is complex.\n\nLet's use the provided solution structure, which is a common way to solve this:\nWe are looking for `n-k` nodes.\nIterate `u` from `n` down to `1`.\nWhen we consider `u`, we assume it will be part of the final component.\nWe use a DSU structure for all nodes. `dsu_size[i]` stores the size of the component rooted at `i`.\n`dsu_kept_count[i]` stores the number of *kept* nodes in the component rooted at `i`.\n`nodes_to_remove`: a list to store the `k` nodes we decide to remove.\n\n1. Initialize DSU: `parent[i] = i`, `dsu_size[i] = 1`, `dsu_kept_count[i] = 0` for all `i`.\n2. `num_kept_total = 0`.\n3. `current_component_count = 0` (number of connected components formed by kept nodes).\n4. `is_kept[i] = False` for all `i`.\n5. Iterate `u` from `n` down to `1`:\n   a. Mark `is_kept[u] = True`.\n   b. `num_kept_total += 1`.\n   c. `dsu_kept_count[find(u)] += 1`.\n   d. `current_component_count += 1`.\n   e. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n      If `is_kept[v]` is `True`:\n         If `find(u) != find(v)`:\n            `root_u = find(u)`, `root_v = find(v)`.\n            `unite(u, v)`.\n            `current_component_count -= 1`.\n   f. Now we have `num_kept_total` nodes marked `is_kept=True`. If `num_kept_total > n-k`:\n      We need to remove a node. Which one? The one that was just added, `u`, is the largest. We don't want to remove `u`.\n      We must remove the smallest node that is currently `is_kept=True` and whose removal does not disconnect the current `kept_nodes`.\n      This implies that the smallest node must be a \"leaf\" in the subgraph induced by `kept_nodes`.\n\nThe problem description implies that we are effectively finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that maximizes the sum of labels.\nThis is a greedy strategy:\n1. Initialize `kept = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n2. Initialize `removed = []`.\n3. Initialize DSU `parent`, `comp_size`, `kept_count` (number of currently kept nodes in a DSU component).\n4. `total_kept_nodes = 0`.\n5. Iterate `u` from `n` down to `1`:\n   a. Mark `kept[u] = True`.\n   b. `total_kept_nodes += 1`.\n   c. `kept_count[find(u)] += 1`.\n   d. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n      If `kept[v]` is `True`:\n         `root_u = find(u)`, `root_v = find(v)`.\n         If `root_u != root_v`:\n            // Unite the components. The component with `u` now contains nodes from `v`'s component.\n            // When uniting, we need to add `kept_count[root_v]` to `kept_count[root_u]` (or vice versa).\n            // Let's say `unite(u, v)` makes `root_u` the new root.\n            `parent[root_v] = root_u`.\n            `comp_size[root_u] += comp_size[root_v]`.\n            `kept_count[root_u] += kept_count[root_v]`.\n   e. Now, `u` has been added. `total_kept_nodes` is the current count of kept nodes.\n   f. We need to ensure that the `total_kept_nodes` form a single connected component.\n      This means `kept_count[find(u)] == total_kept_nodes`.\n      If `total_kept_nodes > n - k`:\n         We have too many kept nodes. We must remove one. Which one?\n         The smallest indexed node in `kept[1...n]` that is a \"leaf\" of the current connected component.\n         This is the key: we remove the smallest-indexed node `x` such that `x` is in the largest component, `x` is a leaf (degree 1) in the current `kept` subgraph, and `x != u`.\n         This is still not quite correct.\n\nThe trick for this problem is to use a specific property of trees and the `2^i` weights.\nWe process nodes from `n` down to `1`. Let `kept_nodes_count` be the number of nodes we have decided to keep.\nLet `removed_nodes` be a list of nodes to be removed.\nWe use a DSU. `parent[i]` is parent of `i`. `size[i]` is size of component `i`.\n`num_kept_in_comp[i]` is the count of nodes *we have decided to keep* in component `i`.\n`is_kept[i]` is a boolean indicating if node `i` is kept.\n\n1. Initialize DSU for `n` nodes. `parent[i] = i`, `size[i] = 1`, `num_kept_in_comp[i] = 0`.\n2. `kept_count = 0`.\n3. `removed = []`.\n4. Iterate `u` from `n` down to `1`:\n   a. Mark `is_kept[u] = True`.\n   b. `kept_count += 1`.\n   c. `num_kept_in_comp[find(u)] += 1`.\n   d. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n      If `is_kept[v]` is `True` and `find(u) != find(v)`:\n         // Union `u` and `v`. The smaller component is merged into the larger one.\n         // Let `root_u = find(u)`, `root_v = find(v)`.\n         // `unite(u, v)` should update `num_kept_in_comp` for the new root.\n         `unite(u, v)` (standard DSU union by size/rank, but also update `num_kept_in_comp`).\n   e. Now, `u` has been added. We have `kept_count` nodes.\n   f. If `kept_count > n - k`: We have too many nodes. We must remove one.\n      Which one? The smallest node `x` (from `1` to `n`) that is `is_kept[x] == True` and `kept_count[find(x)] == total_kept_nodes` (meaning `x` is part of the main connected component).\n      We need to find the smallest `x` (from `1` to `n`) such that `is_kept[x]` is true, and `x` is a leaf in the subgraph formed by `kept` nodes, and `x` is not `u`.\n      This is still not quite right.\n\nThe most common solution for this specific problem (connected subgraph, max sum of `2^i`) is to iterate from `n` down to `1`.\nWhen considering node `u`:\n  If we have already selected `n-k` nodes, we mark `u` for removal.\n  Otherwise, we add `u` to our `kept_nodes` set.\n  We then check if adding `u` connects previously disconnected components of `kept_nodes`.\n  If, after adding `u` and performing unions, we find that the current set of `kept_nodes` forms a connected component but its size is `X > n-k`, we must remove `X - (n-k)` nodes. To maximize the sum, these should be the smallest possible nodes.\n  This means we need to remove the smallest `X - (n-k)` nodes that are currently in `kept_nodes` and are \"leaves\" of the current connected component.\n\nThis is a classic \"remove $k$ leaves\" problem.\n1. Build the adjacency list for the tree.\n2. Calculate initial degrees for all nodes.\n3. Initialize a `deque` (double-ended queue) with all leaf nodes (degree 1). These are candidates for removal.\n4. `nodes_to_remove = []`.\n5. While `k > 0` and the `deque` is not empty:\n   a. Get the smallest node `u` from the `deque`. (If `deque` is sorted, pop left. Otherwise, iterate and find min).\n   b. If `u` is `n` (the largest node), we should not remove it unless absolutely necessary.\n   c. Add `u` to `nodes_to_remove`.\n   d. `k -= 1`.\n   e. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n      Decrement `degree[v]`.\n      If `degree[v] == 1` and `v` is not already removed or in `deque`, add `v` to `deque`.\n6. After this, if `k > 0`, we still need to remove nodes. The remaining `k` nodes must be removed from the \"interior\" of the tree. These would be the smallest remaining nodes that are not yet marked for removal.\n\nThis \"remove leaves\" strategy is for finding a connected component of size `n-k` that is \"most central\".\nThe actual problem is to maximize `sum(2^i)`. This means we want to keep the largest indices.\nSo, we want to remove the smallest indices *that are leaves of the current tree*.\n\nLet's maintain `current_degree[u]` for each node `u`.\n1. Build adjacency list `adj`.\n2. Compute `degree[u]` for all `u`.\n3. Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n4. Initialize `removed_nodes = []`.\n5. Initialize a min-priority queue `pq` with all nodes `u` such that `degree[u] == 1`.\n6. `is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n\n7. While `removed_count < k` and `pq` is not empty:\n   a. Extract the smallest node `u` from `pq`.\n   b. If `is_removed[u]` is already `True`, continue (this can happen if a neighbor was removed, changing `u`'s degree and adding it to `pq` again).\n   c. Mark `is_removed[u] = True`.\n   d. Add `u` to `removed_nodes`.\n   e. `removed_count += 1`.\n   f. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n      If `is_removed[v]` is `False`:\n         `degree[v] -= 1`.\n         If `degree[v] == 1`:\n            Add `v` to `pq`.\n\n8. After the loop, if `removed_count < k`:\n   This means we have removed all possible leaves, but still need to remove `k - removed_count` more nodes.\n   These remaining nodes must be removed from the \"interior\" of the graph.\n   To maximize the sum of `2^i`, we should remove the smallest-indexed remaining nodes that are not yet removed.\n   Iterate `u` from `1` to `n`. If `is_removed[u]` is `False` and `removed_count < k`:\n     Mark `is_removed[u] = True`.\n     Add `u` to `removed_nodes`.\n     `removed_count += 1`.\n\nThis strategy is correct. When we remove a leaf, the remaining graph stays connected. By iteratively removing leaves with the smallest indices, we preserve the largest indices. If we run out of leaves but still need to remove nodes, it means the remaining graph is a path or a cycle (but it's a tree, so it must be a path or a single node if `n-k=1`). In a path, all internal nodes have degree 2. If we remove an internal node, it splits the path. However, the problem states \"all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another\", which means the final set must be connected.\nThe leaf removal process ensures that the remaining `n - removed_count` nodes form a connected component. If we still need to remove more nodes, we must remove internal nodes. Removing an internal node `x` splits the component. To keep the remaining `n-k` nodes connected, we must ensure that all but one of the sub-components formed by removing `x` are also removed. This is not what the problem asks.\n\nThe problem implies that we remove `k` nodes, and the *remaining* `n-k` nodes form a connected component.\nThe leaf removal strategy works. If we remove `k` leaves (or nodes that become leaves), the remaining graph will be connected.\nExample: `1-2-3-4-5-6`. `n=6, k=3`.\nDegrees: `deg(1)=1, deg(2)=2, deg(3)=2, deg(4)=2, deg(5)=2, deg(6)=1`.\nLeaves: `1, 6`. `pq = [1, 6]`.\n1. Pop `1`. `removed=[1]`. `k=2`. `deg(2)=1`. `pq=[2, 6]`.\n2. Pop `2`. `removed=[1, 2]`. `k=1`. `deg(3)=1`. `pq=[3, 6]`.\n3. Pop `3`. `removed=[1, 2, 3]`. `k=0`. `deg(4)=1`. `pq=[4, 6]`.\nDone. Removed `1, 2, 3`. Kept `4, 5, 6`. Connected. Sum `2^4+2^5+2^6`. This is correct.\n\nExample 1: `6 3`, `2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3`.\nGraph:\n  1\n  |\n  2 -- 3\n  | \\\n  4  6 -- 5\nInitial degrees: `deg(1)=1, deg(2)=4, deg(3)=1, deg(4)=1, deg(5)=1, deg(6)=2`.\nLeaves (degree 1): `1, 3, 4, 5`. `pq = [1, 3, 4, 5]`. `k=3`. `removed_count=0`.\n1. Pop `1`. `removed=[1]`. `removed_count=1`. `k=2`.\n   Neighbor of `1` is `2`. `deg(2)` becomes `3`.\n   `pq = [3, 4, 5]`.\n2. Pop `3`. `removed=[1, 3]`. `removed_count=2`. `k=1`.\n   Neighbor of `3` is `2`. `deg(2)` becomes `2`.\n   `pq = [4, 5]`.\n3. Pop `4`. `removed=[1, 3, 4]`. `removed_count=3`. `k=0`.\n   Neighbor of `4` is `2`. `deg(2)` becomes `1`.\n   Add `2` to `pq`. `pq = [2, 5]`.\nLoop ends as `k=0`.\nRemoved nodes: `1, 3, 4`.\nKept nodes: `2, 5, 6`. These are connected: `2-6-5`.\nThis matches the sample output.\n\nThis greedy strategy works because removing a leaf node maintains connectivity of the remaining graph. By repeatedly removing the smallest-indexed leaf, we ensure that the largest-indexed nodes are preserved as much as possible. If `k` is so large that we remove all leaves and still need to remove more nodes, it means the remaining graph becomes a path or a single node. In such a scenario, any remaining node has degree 2 (if not a single node). Removing any of these nodes would disconnect the graph. The problem implies that we *must* remove `k` nodes, and the remaining graph *must* be connected. This means the `k` nodes to be removed must be leaves (or become leaves at some point). If `k` is greater than the number of nodes that can be removed as leaves without disconnecting the graph, then the problem constraints must guarantee such a scenario doesn't happen, or that the \"remaining graph\" can be a single node. The problem statement `1 <= k < n` implies `n-k >= 1`. So, at least one node must remain.\n\nThe maximum number of leaves we can remove without disconnecting the graph is `n - 1` (removing all but one node).\nThe strategy is sound: always remove the smallest-indexed leaf. If we run out of leaves before `k` removals, it means the remaining graph is a path (or a cycle, but it's a tree, so path). If it's a path, all internal nodes have degree 2. Removing any internal node disconnects the path. This implies that the problem guarantees that `k` is not so large that we are forced to disconnect the graph.\nThe number of nodes to keep is `n-k`. The number of nodes to remove is `k`.\nThe leaf removal process continues until `k` nodes are removed or no more leaves can be removed (i.e., the remaining graph is a path of length `>1` or a single node). If `k` is smaller than the number of leaves we can remove, this algorithm finds the optimal set. If `k` is larger, it means the remaining graph will be a path of length `N_keep`. We have to remove `k` nodes. The `n-k` nodes must form a connected component. This means the `k` nodes must be precisely the \"branches\" cut off.\n\nThe algorithm:\n1. Parse input, build adjacency list `adj`.\n2. Calculate initial degrees `deg[u]` for all `u`.\n3. Initialize a min-priority queue `pq` and add all nodes `u` with `deg[u] == 1`.\n4. Initialize `removed_nodes = []` and `is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n5. While `len(removed_nodes) < k` and `pq` is not empty:\n   a. Pop the smallest node `u` from `pq`.\n   b. If `is_removed[u]` is `True` (already processed), continue.\n   c. Mark `is_removed[u] = True`.\n   d. Add `u` to `removed_nodes`.\n   e. For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n      If `is_removed[v]` is `False`:\n         `deg[v] -= 1`.\n         If `deg[v] == 1`:\n            Add `v` to `pq`.\n6. Sort `removed_nodes` and print.\n\nThis algorithm works because `k < n`. This means at least one node must remain. The connected component of `n-k` nodes is formed by preserving the \"core\" of the tree and pruning `k` branches. By always pruning the branch that starts with the smallest available index (a leaf), we maximize the sum of `2^i` for the remaining nodes.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    degrees = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        degrees[u] += 1\n        degrees[v] += 1\n\n    # Special case for n=1 (not possible due to k<n) or n=2, k=1\n    # If n-1 edges, it's a tree.\n    # If n=2, k=1, remove 1, keep 2.
