There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing House Heights Under Zoning Restrictions**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem, and I need a Python solution. The core of it is straightforward: we're trying to maximize the total profit from house heights, which is simply the sum of the squares of individual heights. Easy enough. The complicating factor, of course, is the zoning restrictions.\n\nLet's break it down. We have `n` spots where houses can be built, each with a maximum height of `h`. We also have `m` zoning restrictions. Each restriction tells us a range of spots (`l_j` to `r_j`) and a maximum height (`x_j`) that any house within that range can reach. The profit from a house of height `a_i` is `a_i^2`, and our goal is to maximize the sum of these squares across all houses.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the constraints on each house individually.  For a given spot `i`, the height `a_i` is constrained by the global maximum `h` *and* by any restrictions that apply to that spot. If a restriction range includes the spot `i`, then `a_i` must be less than or equal to the restriction's maximum height (`x_j`).\n\nThis leads me to a clear strategy. For each spot `i`, I'll determine the *maximum allowed height*  by taking the minimum of `h` and all the `x_j` values that apply to that spot. I can create an array `max_allowed_height` to store these values.  I initialize it with `h` for every spot, and then iterate through the restrictions, updating the allowed heights within each range. For a restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`, I'll update `max_allowed_height[k]` to `min(max_allowed_height[k], x_j)` for all `k` in the range `[l_j, r_j]`.\n\nOnce I've processed all the restrictions, the `max_allowed_height` array contains the final constraints. To maximize the profit, it's pretty obvious that I'll simply set the height of each house `i` to its maximum allowed height: `a_i = max_allowed_height[i]`. Since the square function is monotonically increasing, picking the largest possible `a_i` for each house is optimal.\n\nI should also verify my logic: If I assign each house the maximum allowed height, it is clear that 0 <= ai <= h, and that the zoning restrictions are satisfied (because `max(a_k for k in [l_j, ..., r_j]) <= x_j`).\n\nSeems like a sound approach.  Time to code this up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot `i`, we can build a house of integer height `a_i` such that `0 <= a_i <= h`. The profit from a house of height `a_i` is `a_i^2`. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house in a given range `[l_j, r_j]` must be at most `x_j`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on the height of a house at a specific spot `i`.\n1.  **Global maximum height:** Every house height `a_i` must be between `0` and `h` inclusive. So, `a_i <= h`.\n2.  **Zoning restrictions:** For each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`, if spot `i` falls within the range `[l_j, r_j]` (i.e., `l_j <= i <= r_j`), then the height `a_i` must be at most `x_j`. This is because if `a_i` were greater than `x_j`, then `max(a_k for k in [l_j, ..., r_j])` would be at least `a_i`, which would violate the restriction `max(a_k for k in [l_j, ..., r_j]) <= x_j`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `i`, its height `a_i` must satisfy:\n`a_i <= h`\n`a_i <= x_j` for every restriction `j` such that `l_j <= i <= r_j`.\n\nTherefore, for each spot `i`, the maximum allowed height, let's call it `max_h[i]`, is the minimum of `h` and all `x_j` values from restrictions that cover spot `i`.\n`max_h[i] = min(h, min(x_j for all j such that l_j <= i <= r_j))` (if no restriction covers `i`, `min` over empty set is effectively `infinity`, so it's just `h`).\n\nTo maximize the total profit `sum(a_i^2)`, we should choose `a_i` to be as large as possible for each spot `i`, because `a_i^2` is an increasing function for `a_i >= 0`.\nSo, for each spot `i`, the optimal height to choose is `a_i = max_h[i]`.\n\nThis choice satisfies all conditions:\n*   `0 <= a_i <= h`: `max_h[i]` is derived from `h` and `x_j` values, which are all within `0` and `h`.\n*   For any restriction `(l_k, r_k, x_k)`: We need to ensure `max(a_p for p in [l_k, ..., r_k]) <= x_k`. By construction, for any `p` in `[l_k, ..., r_k]`, `a_p = max_h[p] <= x_k` (because `x_k` was one of the values considered when calculating `max_h[p]`). Since every `a_p` in the range is at most `x_k`, their maximum `max(a_p)` must also be at most `x_k`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize an array `max_heights` of size `n`, where `max_heights[i]` stores the maximum allowed height for spot `i+1`. Set all elements to `h`. (Using 0-indexed array for convenience, so `max_heights[k]` corresponds to spot `k+1`).\n2.  For each of the `m` restrictions `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`:\n    Iterate through the spots `k` from `l_j-1` to `r_j-1` (inclusive, to convert to 0-indexed).\n    Update `max_heights[k] = min(max_heights[k], x_j)`.\n3.  Calculate the total profit: Initialize `total_profit = 0`.\n    For each height `h_val` in `max_heights`:\n    Add `h_val * h_val` to `total_profit`.\n4.  Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions:\n`1 1 1`\n`2 2 3`\n`3 3 2`\n\n1.  Initialize `max_heights = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3).\n2.  Process restrictions:\n    *   `l=1, r=1, x=1`: `max_heights[0] = min(max_heights[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n        `max_heights` is now `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   `l=2, r=2, x=3`: `max_heights[1] = min(max_heights[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n        `max_heights` is still `[1, 3, 3]`.\n    *   `l=3, r=3, x=2`: `max_heights[2] = min(max_heights[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n        `max_heights` is now `[1, 3, 2]`.\n3.  Calculate total profit:\n    `1*1 + 3*3 + 2*2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Initialization: O(N)\n*   Processing restrictions: For each of `m` restrictions, we iterate over a range of spots. In the worst case, a restriction covers all `n` spots. So, `m` restrictions can take up to `O(m * n)` time.\n*   Calculating profit: O(N)\nTotal time complexity: `O(N + M*N)`.\nGiven `N, H, M <= 50`, `M*N` is at most `50*50 = 2500`, which is very efficient and well within typical time limits.\nSpace complexity: `O(N)` for `max_heights` array.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize max_heights for each spot.\n    # Initially, each spot can have a house up to global maximum height 'h'.\n    # Using 0-indexed array, so max_heights[i] corresponds to spot i+1.\n    max_heights = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each zoning restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Apply the restriction to all spots in the range [l, r]\n        # Convert l and r to 0-indexed: l-1 to r-1\n        for i in range(l - 1, r):\n            # The height of house i must be at most x,\n            # and also at most its current maximum allowed height.\n            # So, take the minimum of the current max_height and x.\n            max_heights[i] = min(max_heights[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total maximum profit\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in max_heights:\n        total_profit += height * height\n    \n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the solution\nsolve()\n\n```",
