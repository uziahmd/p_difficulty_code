A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Soft Drinking Solution**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this \"Soft Drinking\" problem. The core idea is simple: figure out how many toasts each friend can make, given limited resources. It's a resource allocation problem at its heart.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs: the number of friends (`n`), the amount of drink and ingredients (`k`, `l`, `c`, `d`, `p`), and the consumption per friend per toast (`nl`, `np`).\n\nThe goal is to calculate the *maximum* number of toasts *each* friend can have, with all friends getting the same amount.\n\nThe calculations break down into three resource constraints:\n\n1.  **Drink:**  We have `k * l` milliliters total.  Each friend needs `nl` ml per toast.  The total possible *individual* toasts from drink is `(k * l) // nl`.\n2.  **Limes:** We have `c * d` lime slices total. Each friend needs one slice per toast, so again `c * d` is the *total possible individual* toasts from limes.\n3.  **Salt:**  We have `p` grams of salt. Each friend needs `np` grams per toast, so `p // np` is the *total possible individual* toasts from salt.\n\nThe key insight is that the *total* number of toasts possible is limited by the smallest of these three values. That's the maximum number of single-person toasts we can make with the given resources: `min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_lime, toasts_from_salt)`.\n\nFinally, since there are `n` friends and they must each have the same number of toasts, we divide this `min` value by `n`. That's `min_total // n`, and that's the number of toasts each friend can make. I'm using integer division (`//`) because you can't have fractional toasts.\n\nSo, in Python, I'll read the input as integers, calculate the three limiting factors, find the minimum, divide by the number of friends, and print the result. The sample examples confirm this approach.\n\nNo edge cases to worry about (all positive integers <= 1000). The biggest intermediate product is `1000 * 1000` which is fine for Python integers. The division is also fine. I'll make sure to use `sys.stdin.readline()` for fast input.\n\nMy final code should be efficient, clear, and concise. It's really just about correctly interpreting \"how many toasts each friend can have\" and applying the minimum constraint and integer division. This all seems solid now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given a set of resources and requirements per toast. All friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\nLet's break down the resources and requirements:\n\n1.  **Drink:**\n    *   Total bottles: `k`\n    *   Milliliters per bottle: `l`\n    *   Total milliliters of drink available: `k * l`\n    *   Milliliters needed per friend per toast: `nl`\n    *   The total number of *individual* toasts that can be made from the drink is `(k * l) // nl`. We use integer division because we can only make whole toasts.\n\n2.  **Lime Slices:**\n    *   Total limes: `c`\n    *   Slices per lime: `d`\n    *   Total lime slices available: `c * d`\n    *   Slices needed per friend per toast: 1 (implied, as it says \"a slice of lime\")\n    *   The total number of *individual* toasts that can be made from lime slices is `c * d`.\n\n3.  **Salt:**\n    *   Total grams of salt available: `p`\n    *   Grams needed per friend per toast: `np`\n    *   The total number of *individual* toasts that can be made from salt is `p // np`. We use integer division for whole toasts.\n\nThe total number of toasts the group can make is limited by the scarcest resource. Therefore, we find the minimum of the individual toast counts calculated for drink, lime, and salt.\nLet `total_individual_toasts_possible = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_lime, toasts_from_salt)`.\n\nFinally, since there are `n` friends and they all must make the same number of toasts, we divide this `total_individual_toasts_possible` by `n` to find out how many toasts each friend can make.\n`toasts_per_friend = total_individual_toasts_possible // n`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1`\n\n1.  **Drink:** `(k * l) // nl = (4 * 5) // 3 = 20 // 3 = 6` individual toasts.\n2.  **Lime:** `c * d = 10 * 8 = 80` individual toasts.\n3.  **Salt:** `p // np = 100 // 1 = 100` individual toasts.\n\nThe minimum of these is `min(6, 80, 100) = 6`.\nSince there are `n=3` friends, each friend can make `6 // 3 = 2` toasts.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the single line of space-separated integers\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Calculate the maximum number of individual toasts possible based on drink\n    # Total milliliters of drink: k * l\n    # Milliliters needed per friend per toast: nl\n    toasts_from_drink = (k * l) // nl\n\n    # Calculate the maximum number of individual toasts possible based on lime slices\n    # Total lime slices: c * d\n    # Each friend needs 1 slice per toast\n    toasts_from_lime = c * d\n\n    # Calculate the maximum number of individual toasts possible based on salt\n    # Total grams of salt: p\n    # Grams needed per friend per toast: np\n    toasts_from_salt = p // np\n\n    # The overall limiting factor for individual toasts is the minimum of the three resources\n    min_total_individual_toasts = min(toasts_from_drink, toasts_from_lime, toasts_from_salt)\n\n    # Since there are 'n' friends and they all make the same number of toasts,\n    # divide the total possible individual toasts by 'n' to get toasts per friend.\n    toasts_per_friend = min_total_individual_toasts // n\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(toasts_per_friend)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
