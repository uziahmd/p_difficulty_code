The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Neko Finds Grapes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Neko Finds Grapes.\" My goal is clear: write a Python script to maximize the number of chests Neko can open.  I've already analyzed the core of the problem: a key opens a chest if their sum is odd.  That means an odd chest needs an even key, and an even chest needs an odd key. Simple enough, but let's break it down properly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. We're dealing with up to 10<sup>5</sup> chests and keys, and the numbers within them can go up to 10<sup>9</sup>. That's good, since it indicates I don't need to worry about really complex data structures, but I still want an efficient strategy.  The one-to-one matching rule is also critical. A key only opens one chest, and each chest is only opened once.\n\nMy initial strategy is to categorize the chests and keys. I'll split the chests into `odd_chests` and `even_chests` and do the same for keys with `odd_keys` and `even_keys`.  Then, I'll count them, letting `count_a_odd`, `count_a_even`, `count_b_odd`, and `count_b_even` represent the respective counts.\n\nMatching is the heart of the algorithm. I'll determine how many chests I can open: `min(count_a_odd, count_b_even)` for odd chests/even keys, and `min(count_a_even, count_b_odd)` for even chests/odd keys. This uses the constraints most directly, because the `min` function models the one-to-one constraint.  The total number of chests Neko can open is simply the sum of these two matches.\n\nLooking at the provided example walkthrough, it confirms this strategy works as expected. I took the example data, categorized it, calculated the matches, and it matched the example output perfectly. I'm feeling confident about this approach.\n\nThe code is then quite straightforward: I read the input values for `n`, `m`, the lists `a` and `b`. I initialize the counts to zero. I can easily iterate through `a` and `b`, populating the count variables based on the parity. Finally, I apply the matching logic and output the total. This plan seems solid, and I can now proceed to write the Python script.\n",
