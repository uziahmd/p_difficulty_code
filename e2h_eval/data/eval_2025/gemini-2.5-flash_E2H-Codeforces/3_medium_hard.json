Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Understanding the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" Problem and Crafting a Solution**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core challenge is figuring out the *smallest* light radius needed for lanterns to illuminate a street. We've got a street of length `l`, and `n` lanterns at specific spots (`a_i`). Each lantern casts light within a radius `d` (centered at its position), covering segments like `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`. Our goal is to find the minimum `d` that ensures the *entire* street from 0 to `l` is lit.\n\nWe'll start by sorting the lantern positions; that's crucial. Then, we identify three critical scenarios for determining the required `d`:\n\n1.  **The Start:** The initial segment from 0 to the first lantern's position (`a_1`) must be lit.  To cover point 0, `d` must be at least equal to `a_1`.\n2.  **The End:** Similarly, the gap from the last lantern (`a_n`) to the end of the street (`l`) needs illumination. For this, `d` must be greater than or equal to `l - a_n`.\n3.  **The Gaps:** Between adjacent lanterns (`a_i` and `a_{i+1}`), the space between them is critical.  We need the lanterns' coverage to meet or overlap.  This means the distance between lanterns should be covered by at least two `d` radii, so `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.\n\nTo determine the smallest `d` that covers the entire street, we must identify the *maximum* of these individual requirements. This ensures every part of the street is lit.  So, we'll calculate:\n\n*   `d_1 = a_1` (for the start of the street)\n*   `d_2 = l - a_n` (for the end of the street)\n*   `d_i = (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` for all gaps between lanterns.\n\nThe minimum `d` is then `max(d_1, d_2, max(d_i))`\n\nMy Python code implementation will: read the input, sort the lantern positions, and then calculate these three requirements, taking the maximum value.  It will use floating-point numbers for `d` to maintain precision and ensures the final answer is formatted to meet the specific precision requirements of the problem. This approach should be efficient and accurate, covering any edge cases like a single lantern or lanterns at the street's boundaries. It should then be a matter of checking if it all makes sense by going through some example inputs, to ensure the code works as expected.\n",
