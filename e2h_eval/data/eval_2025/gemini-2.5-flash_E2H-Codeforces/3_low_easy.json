Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Vanya and Lanterns Problem with Python**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. Let me break this down. Basically, we have a street of length `l` and `n` lanterns at different positions. Each lantern has a radius of illumination, and we want to find the smallest radius, `d`, such that the entire street is lit.\n\nMy approach here needs to be systematic. First, I have to *understand the constraints*. Every point on the street, from 0 to `l`, has to be lit by *at least* one lantern.  This means the distance from a lantern to any point `x` must be less than or equal to `d`. Mathematically, if a lantern is at `a_i`, then `a_i - d <= x <= a_i + d`.\n\nThe *key insight* is that sorting the lantern positions simplifies everything. If I sort them, I can easily identify the critical points: the beginning of the street (0), the end of the street (`l`), and the gaps between the lanterns.\n\nHere's my *strategy*:\n\n1.  **Sort the Lanterns:**  Sorting the `a_i` values is the first step. Let's call them `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}` after sorting.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Critical Gaps:**\n    *   **The Beginning:**  The segment from 0 to the first lantern's position, `a_0`, *must* be lit. The minimum radius needs to be at least `a_0`.\n    *   **The End:** Similarly, the segment from the last lantern's position, `a_{n-1}`, to `l` also needs coverage.  The minimum radius has to be at least `l - a_{n-1}`.\n    *   **Between Lanterns:**  For any two consecutive lanterns, `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, the gap `(a_{i+1} - a_i)` is crucial.  The radius `d` must be large enough to cover half the distance between any two adjacent lanterns.  So,  `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. I need to find the *largest* of these gaps.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Minimum `d`:**\n    The minimum radius, `d`, will be the *maximum* value I calculate from the three cases above: `a_0`, `l - a_{n-1}`, and the maximum half-gap between adjacent lanterns.  In other words: `d = max(a_0, l - a_{n-1}, max((a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2))`.\n\nNow, I'm ready to translate this logic into a Python script. This should be a straightforward implementation.\n",
