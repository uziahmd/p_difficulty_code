Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Let's Feed This Golorp!**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me: \"Feed the Golorp.\" The input is a string representing this Golorp's name, and it has this weird structure, like `?(<expression>):-<conditions>.` I see a clear split there between what they're calling the \"jaws\" and the \"stomach.\"\n\nThe \"jaws,\" the `<expression>` part, is the key to figuring out how many \"variables\" I'm going to need. It seems to be an arithmetic expression with just `_`, `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Each `_` represents a variable, which will be a single digit from 0 to 9. The number of `_` characters dictates how many variables, let's call them `x_0, x_1, x_2`, I'll be working with. For example, in something like `_-_/___*__`, I can see 1+1+3+2 = 7 variables. The expression then becomes some sort of calculation like this (x0 - x1 / x2x3x4 * x5x6).\n\nThe \"stomach,\" the `<conditions>` part, has the constraints. It's a comma-separated list of comparisons, like `___>__`, `___<__`, or `___=__`. These conditions are the rules that any solution must satisfy.\n\nMy overall goal is to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits for the variables that meet all the conditions. I'm thinking a backtracking or recursive approach will be necessary, where I start assigning values to each variable, starting at 0, and if I hit a contradiction, I go back and try the next value. The first solution I find will automatically be the lexicographically smallest.\n\nOkay, let's break down the parsing. I need to split the string at `):-`. That gives me the expression and the conditions. The examples:\n`['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', ...]` all have that clear separator.\n\nNow I need to parse the expression to determine the variables. For something like `_-_/___*__`, I know to look for each underscore character. A sequence like `___` represents a concatenated number formed by three digits. I need to be careful with the order of operations and the intended meaning of `___`. So it's not simply x2, x3, and x4 that I'm multiplying together, but an integer.\n\nMy strategy needs to handle two things now: the parsing of the expression and the conditions. It feels like this is more about translating strings into mathematical structures and then solving the resulting constraints. It's essentially about finding the right numerical assignments for each variable that satisfy the imposed constraints. Easy!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that can be assigned to variables in a golorp's name such that all conditions are met. If no such sequence exists, we output \"false\".\n\nThe golorp's name has a specific structure: `?(<expression>):-<conditions>.`\n\n**1. Parsing the Name:**\nWe first extract the `<expression>` and `<conditions>` parts. The separator is `):-`.\n\n**2. Identifying Variables:**\nAll `_` characters in the `<expression>` part represent distinct variables. We count the total number of `_`s in the expression to determine `N`, the number of variables. Let's say we have `N` variables, `x_0, x_1, ..., x_{N-1}`.\n\n**3. Processing the Expression (Jaws):**\nThe expression part, like `_-_/___*__`, defines how variables are grouped into numbers. A sequence of `k` underscores (`_..._`) represents a `k`-digit number formed by `k` consecutive variables. For example, `___` would be `x_i x_{i+1} x_{i+2}`. This part essentially defines the *total number of variables* `N` that we need to assign values to. The specific arithmetic operations in the expression are a red herring; they don't impose constraints on the variables themselves, only the number of variables.\n\n**4. Processing the Conditions (Stomach):**\nThe `<conditions>` part is a comma-separated list of comparisons. Each comparison has the form `LHS<OP>RHS`, where `OP` can be `>`, `<`, or `=`.\nBoth `LHS` and `RHS` are sequences of underscores, like `__` or `___`. Similar to the expression, `k` underscores in a condition (`_..._`) represent a `k`-digit number. For example, `___` means a 3-digit number.\nCrucially, the problem states: \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive.\" and \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" This implies that the variables are indexed sequentially from `x_0` to `x_{N-1}`.\nWhen a condition like `___>__` appears, the first `_` in `___` refers to `x_0`, the second to `x_1`, the third to `x_2`. Then the first `_` in `__` refers to `x_3`, and the second to `x_4`. So, `___>__` becomes `(100*x_0 + 10*x_1 + x_2) > (10*x_3 + x_4)`.\nA leading zero in a multi-digit number is generally not allowed unless the number is `0` itself (e.g., `01` is not `1`). However, the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention this. Given the \"easy question\" hint, it's safer to assume that `0` is a valid leading digit for any number of digits (e.g., `012` is 12, `007` is 7). This simplifies the problem significantly as we don't need special handling for leading zeros.\n\n**5. Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Sequence:**\nSince we need the lexicographically smallest sequence, we can use a backtracking (recursive depth-first search) approach.\n*   We'll try to assign values to `x_0`, then `x_1`, and so on, up to `x_{N-1}`.\n*   For each variable `x_i`, we iterate through possible digit values from `0` to `9`.\n*   After assigning a value to `x_i`, we recursively call the function to assign `x_{i+1}`.\n*   Before returning from a recursive call, we check if the current partial assignment of variables (from `x_0` to `x_i`) violates any condition. If it does, we prune that branch and try the next digit for `x_i`.\n*   Once all `N` variables have been assigned values, we check if *all* conditions are satisfied. If they are, we've found a valid sequence. Since we iterate digits from `0` to `9` for each variable, the first valid sequence found will be the lexicographically smallest.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input:**\n    *   Find `):-` to split the name into `expr_str` and `cond_str`.\n2.  **Count Variables (`N`):**\n    *   Count `_` characters in `expr_str`. This is `N`.\n3.  **Parse Conditions:**\n    *   Initialize `variable_idx = 0`.\n    *   For each condition in `cond_str` (split by `,`):\n        *   Find the operator (`>`, `<`, `=`).\n        *   Split into `LHS_str` and `RHS_str`.\n        *   For `LHS_str`:\n            *   Number of digits `num_digits_LHS = LHS_str.count('_')`.\n            *   Store `(variable_idx, num_digits_LHS)` as the start index and length for LHS.\n            *   Update `variable_idx += num_digits_LHS`.\n        *   For `RHS_str`:\n            *   Number of digits `num_digits_RHS = RHS_str.count('_')`.\n            *   Store `(variable_idx, num_digits_RHS)` as the start index and length for RHS.\n            *   Update `variable_idx += num_digits_RHS`.\n        *   Store the parsed condition: `(LHS_info, operator, RHS_info)`.\n    *   If `N` (from `expr_str`) is different from `variable_idx` (from `cond_str`), it means the problem statement's implicit variable indexing is inconsistent, or my interpretation of `_` usage in expression is wrong. Given the \"easy\" tag, `N` should be derived *only* from `expr_str`. The `variable_idx` from conditions parsing is only for *local* variable assignments within conditions. Let's re-evaluate: The total number of variables `N` is determined by the *expression*. The conditions then refer to these `N` variables in order. For example, if `N=4`, `_>__` means `x_0 > (10*x_1 + x_2)`. The `_` in `_>__` would map to `x_0`, `x_1`, `x_2`. This means the `variable_idx` should be global across *all* conditions, starting from 0.\n\n    **Revised Variable Indexing:**\n    *   `N` is the total count of `_` in `expr_str`.\n    *   When parsing conditions, we maintain a global `current_var_idx` starting from 0.\n    *   For `___>__`:\n        *   LHS `___` maps to `x_current_var_idx, x_{current_var_idx+1}, x_{current_var_idx+2}`. Store `(current_var_idx, 3)`.\n        *   `current_var_idx += 3`.\n        *   RHS `__` maps to `x_current_var_idx, x_{current_var_idx+1}`. Store `(current_var_idx, 2)`.\n        *   `current_var_idx += 2`.\n    *   This `current_var_idx` *must* be equal to `N` after parsing all conditions. If not, the input is malformed or my understanding is incorrect. Example: `_-_/___*__` has 7 `_`. `___>__` uses `x_0,x_1,x_2` for LHS, `x_3,x_4` for RHS. Total 5 variables used. What about `x_5, x_6`? This implies that the variables used in conditions are a *subset* of the variables defined by the expression. The problem states \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" This strongly suggests a single, contiguous list of variables `x_0, ..., x_{N-1}`. The most straightforward interpretation is that the `_` in the conditions refer to these `x_i`s sequentially.\n\n    **Revised Variable Indexing (Final approach):**\n    *   Count `N` (total `_` in `expr_str`). This is the number of variables to assign.\n    *   Initialize `var_map_idx = 0`.\n    *   For each condition:\n        *   Parse `LHS_str`, `OP`, `RHS_str`.\n        *   `LHS_len = LHS_str.count('_')`. Store `(var_map_idx, LHS_len)` for LHS.\n        *   `var_map_idx += LHS_len`.\n        *   `RHS_len = RHS_str.count('_')`. Store `(var_map_idx, RHS_len)` for RHS.\n        *   `var_map_idx += RHS_len`.\n    *   This `var_map_idx` will effectively be the total number of variables *referenced* in the conditions. If `var_map_idx < N`, it means some variables from the expression are not constrained by conditions. If `var_map_idx > N`, the input is invalid (not possible by problem statement \"name is guaranteed to be valid\").\n    *   We will generate `N` variables `x_0` to `x_{N-1}`.\n\n4.  **Backtracking Function (`solve(k, current_values)`):**\n    *   `k`: The index of the variable we are currently trying to assign (`x_k`).\n    *   `current_values`: A list of digits `[x_0, x_1, ..., x_{k-1}]` already assigned.\n    *   **Base Case:** If `k == N`:\n        *   All variables `x_0` to `x_{N-1}` have been assigned.\n        *   Check if *all* parsed conditions are satisfied using `current_values`.\n        *   If all satisfied, return `current_values` (as a string).\n        *   If not, return `None`.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** For `digit` from `0` to `9`:\n        *   `current_values[k] = digit`.\n        *   **Pruning (Early Check):** Check if any condition involving *only* variables `x_0` to `x_k` is violated. If `x_k` is the last variable in an LHS or RHS of a condition, we can evaluate it. If it's violated, `continue` to the next `digit`.\n        *   `result = solve(k + 1, current_values)`.\n        *   If `result` is not `None` (meaning a solution was found down this path), return `result`.\n    *   If no `digit` leads to a solution, return `None`.\n\n5.  **Helper Function `evaluate_number(start_idx, length, values)`:**\n    *   Takes `start_idx`, `length`, and the `values` list.\n    *   Constructs the number: `10^(length-1) * values[start_idx] + ... + values[start_idx + length - 1]`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.`**\n\n1.  **Parse:**\n    *   `expr_str = \"__-_+_/_____\"`\n    *   `cond_str = \"__>__,_____<__\"`\n2.  **Count N:**\n    *   `expr_str` has 2+1+1+5 = 9 underscores. So, `N = 9`. We need to find `x_0` to `x_8`.\n3.  **Parse Conditions:**\n    *   `conditions = []`\n    *   `var_map_idx = 0`\n    *   **Condition 1: `__>__`**\n        *   LHS `__`: `(var_map_idx=0, length=2)`. `var_map_idx` becomes 2.\n        *   RHS `__`: `(var_map_idx=2, length=2)`. `var_map_idx` becomes 4.\n        *   `conditions.append( ((0,2), '>', (2,2)) )`\n    *   **Condition 2: `_____<__`**\n        *   LHS `_____`: `(var_map_idx=4, length=5)`. `var_map_idx` becomes 9.\n        *   RHS `__`: `(var_map_idx=9, length=2)`. `var_map_idx` becomes 11.\n        *   `conditions.append( ((4,5), '<', (9,2)) )`\n    *   Wait, `var_map_idx` became 11, but `N` is 9. This means my variable mapping interpretation is wrong.\n\n**Corrected Variable Mapping/Condition Interpretation:**\nThe problem statement: \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\" This means `x_0, x_1, ..., x_{N-1}` are the variables. The `_`s in the conditions *refer to these same variables*. The first `_` in the conditions refers to `x_0`, the second to `x_1`, and so on, *globally across all conditions*.\n\nLet's re-parse `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` with this understanding:\n\n1.  **Parse:**\n    *   `expr_str = \"__-_+_/_____\"`\n    *   `cond_str = \"__>__,_____<__\"`\n2.  **Count N:**\n    *   `N = 9` (from `expr_str`).\n3.  **Parse Conditions (Revised):**\n    *   `conditions = []`\n    *   `current_global_var_idx = 0`\n    *   **Condition 1: `__>__`**\n        *   LHS `__`: refers to `x_0, x_1`. So, `(0, 2)`.\n        *   `current_global_var_idx = 2`.\n        *   RHS `__`: refers to `x_2, x_3`. So, `(2, 2)`.\n        *   `current_global_var_idx = 4`.\n        *   `conditions.append( ((0,2), '>', (2,2)) )`\n    *   **Condition 2: `_____<__`**\n        *   LHS `_____`: refers to `x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8`. So, `(4, 5)`.\n        *   `current_global_var_idx = 9`.\n        *   RHS `__`: If `current_global_var_idx` is already 9, there are no more variables `x_9, x_{10}`. This condition is invalid given `N=9`. This is the core ambiguity.\n\n    **The most common interpretation in competitive programming for problems like this (especially \"easy\" ones) is:**\n    *   The `_` in the expression defines `N`.\n    *   The `_` in the conditions *re-use* variables from `x_0` to `x_{N-1}`.\n    *   Each condition has its own local set of `_`s. E.g., `_>_` in one condition means `x_0 > x_1`, and `_<_` in another condition also means `x_0 < x_1`. This is highly unlikely as it leads to contradictions.\n\n    **The only robust interpretation that makes sense for \"lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp\" and \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws\" is:**\n    *   `N` is the total count of `_` characters in the `expression` part. This determines the length of the output sequence.\n    *   The `_` characters in the `conditions` part are *separate* variables from the `expression` part. They are assigned values *independently* but are *implicitly mapped* to `x_0, x_1, ...` as they appear in the conditions. This means the `_`s in the conditions define *their own set of variables* that need to be satisfied, and these conditions are the *only* constraints. The `expression` part only defines `N`, the *total number of variables to be output*.\n\n    Let's re-examine `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` with this interpretation:\n    *   `expr_str = \"__-_+_/_____\"` -> `N = 9`. We need to output 9 digits.\n    *   `cond_str = \"__>__,_____<__\"`\n        *   Condition 1: `__>__`\n            *   LHS `__` means `10*v_0 + v_1`\n            *   RHS `__` means `10*v_2 + v_3`\n            *   Constraint: `(10*v_0 + v_1) > (10*v_2 + v_3)`\n        *   Condition 2: `_____<__`\n            *   LHS `_____` means `10000*v_4 + 1000*v_5 + 100*v_6 + 10*v_7 + v_8`\n            *   RHS `__` means `10*v_9 + v_{10}`\n            *   Constraint: `(10000*v_4 + ... + v_8) < (10*v_9 + v_{10})`\n        *   Total variables needed for conditions: `v_0` to `v_{10}`, which is 11 variables.\n    *   This is the \"mapping variables in conditions to output variables\" problem. If `N=9` but conditions need 11 variables, this is a mismatch.\n\n    **The only remaining interpretation (and the one that usually works for \"easy\" problems with this syntax):**\n    *   Count `N` from the `expression` part. This is the number of variables to assign (e.g., `x_0` to `x_{N-1}`).\n    *   The `_`s in the `conditions` part *refer to these same `x_i`s sequentially*.\n    *   If `N=9` and conditions are `__>__, _____<__`:\n        *   `__` in first condition: `x_0, x_1`\n        *   `__` in first condition: `x_2, x_3`\n        *   `_____` in second condition: `x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8`\n        *   `__` in second condition: `x_9, x_{10}`. **This is where the problem arises.** If `N=9`, `x_9` and `x_{10}` don't exist.\n\n    This means the example `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` with output `false` is critical. If `N=9` but the conditions require `x_0` through `x_{10}`, then it's impossible to feed because not enough variables are provided by the jaws (`expression`). This interpretation seems most robust and leads to `false` for the second example.\n\n    Let's re-parse the conditions using this final interpretation:\n\n    **Final Interpretation for Parsing Conditions:**\n    1.  Count `N` from `expr_str`. This is the total number of variables `x_0, ..., x_{N-1}`.\n    2.  Initialize `current_var_idx_in_conditions = 0`. This tracks which `x_i` we are currently mapping to.\n    3.  For each condition string (e.g., `___>__`):\n        *   Parse `LHS_str`, `OP`, `RHS_str`.\n        *   `LHS_len = LHS_str.count('_')`.\n        *   `LHS_start_idx = current_var_idx_in_conditions`.\n        *   `current_var_idx_in_conditions += LHS_len`.\n        *   `RHS_len = RHS_str.count('_')`.\n        *   `RHS_start_idx = current_var_idx_in_conditions`.\n        *   `current_var_idx_in_conditions += RHS_len`.\n        *   Store `( (LHS_start_idx, LHS_len), OP, (RHS_start_idx, RHS_len) )`.\n        *   **Crucial Check:** If `current_var_idx_in_conditions > N` at any point, it means the conditions require more variables than the expression provides.
