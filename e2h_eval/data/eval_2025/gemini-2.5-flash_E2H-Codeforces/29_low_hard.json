Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Plan: Modulo Arithmetic and Composition for String Replacements**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem and it's all about string replacements and large numbers, and I *know* I can crack this. The core is using Python, specifically dealing with the modulo arithmetic.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about the inputs: an initial string `s` of digits, and a bunch of queries where `di` gets replaced by `ti`.  The goal is to calculate the final number, modulo 10^9 + 7.  The catch? The string gets *huge* really fast, so I can't build it directly.  That means I'll have to use the given constraints.\n\nI see that `n` and the sum of `ti`'s lengths are limited to 10^5, and modulo arithmetic with M = 10^9 + 7 is the key. So I have to optimize my method.\n\n**Breaking Down the Challenge:**\n\nThe problem boils down to a recursive composition. I know that if I have a starting string, and apply the queries, I am expanding a digit with a longer string. In addition, I have to compute this efficiently because the string can become exponentially long.\n\nI need a way to track what each digit *eventually* represents in terms of a numerical value and length, all modulo `M`. No building the final string, I must be efficient with my operations.\n\n**The Key Insight: Working Backwards & Mapping Digits**\n\nThe *genius* idea is to build a mapping.  I'll define `val[d]` to store the final numerical value of digit `d` (modulo M), and `len[d]` to store the final length of the string `d` eventually becomes.\n\nInitially, `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1`, and then I work backwards.\n\nWhen I process a query `di -> ti`, I update `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on the string `ti`. Think of `ti` as a sequence `c_1 c_2 ... c_k`. When I concatenate, it will be the summation of all individual character. The string can be extremely long, but modulo operation keeps it simple.\n\nSo, I will iterate through ti, and update the di character based on the current value. I will then have the final value.\n\nBy focusing on tracking and updating what each digit *represents* rather than materializing the entire string, I can bypass the memory and time limits and solve the problem. I can use the length for modulo calculations and avoid creating large string objects.  Brilliant!  Time to code this up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of string replacement queries and then compute the numerical value of the final string modulo 10^9 + 7. The string can grow extremely long, so we cannot explicitly construct it. We need a method to calculate the final value and length for each digit without building the full string.\n\n**Core Idea: Processing Queries in Reverse**\n\nThe key observation is that when a query `di -> ti` is processed, it changes what the digit `di` represents. However, it does *not* change what any other digit `dj` (where `dj != di`) represents. This suggests that the effect of a query on `di` depends on the *current* representation of the digits in `ti`. If we process queries in the given order, the meaning of `c_j` in `ti` might change later. This makes forward processing complicated.\n\nInstead, let's process the queries in *reverse order*.\nWhen we process a query `di -> ti` in reverse:\n1.  We know the final representation (value and length) for all digits `0` through `9` *after* all queries (i.e., immediately before this current query in reverse order). Let's call these `current_val[d]` and `current_len[d]`.\n2.  The query `di -> ti` means that *before* this query was applied (in forward time), the digit `di` actually represented what `ti` would evaluate to *at that moment*.\n3.  So, to find what `di` represented *before* this query, we need to evaluate `ti` using the `current_val[c]` and `current_len[c]` for each character `c` in `ti`. This new value and length will then become the `current_val[di]` and `current_len[di]` for the next query (further back in time).\n\n**Data Structures for Each Digit (0-9):**\nWe'll maintain two arrays, `val` and `length`, both of size 10.\n*   `val[d]` will store the numerical value (modulo 10^9 + 7) that digit `d` eventually represents.\n*   `length[d]` will store the length (modulo 10^9 + 6, for exponents) of the string that digit `d` eventually represents. Note that length can be 0 if `d` maps to an empty string.\n\n**Initialization (Base Case for Reverse Processing):**\nInitially, before any queries are considered (which is the state *after* all queries have been applied, from the perspective of reverse processing), each digit `d` represents itself:\n*   `val[d] = d`\n*   `length[d] = 1`\nFor example, `val[0]=0, val[1]=1, ..., val[9]=9`. `length[0]=1, length[1]=1, ..., length[9]=1`.\n\n**Modulo Constant:**\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\n**Processing Queries in Reverse:**\nFor each query `di -> ti` (starting from the last query and going backwards to the first):\n1.  Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n2.  Iterate through the string `ti` from right to left (to correctly calculate positional values):\n    For each character `c` in `ti` (from right to left):\n    *   `digit_val = val[int(c)]` (the current value of `c`)\n    *   `digit_len = length[int(c)]` (the current length of `c`)\n    *   `new_val_di = (new_val_di + digit_val * pow(10, new_len_di, MOD)) % MOD`\n    *   `new_len_di = (new_len_di + digit_len) % (MOD - 1)` (Lengths are exponents, so they are modulo `MOD-1` by Fermat's Little Theorem).\n3.  Update `val[int(di)] = new_val_di` and `length[int(di)] = new_len_di`.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` now represent what each original digit `d` from the input string `s` will eventually become.\nNow, iterate through the initial string `s` from left to right:\n1.  Initialize `final_ans = 0` and `total_len = 0`.\n2.  For each character `c` in `s`:\n    *   `digit_val = val[int(c)]`\n    *   `digit_len = length[int(c)]`\n    *   `final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, digit_len, MOD) + digit_val) % MOD`\n    *   `total_len = (total_len + digit_len) % (MOD - 1)` (This `total_len` is not strictly needed for the final answer, but it's good practice to keep track of it if we were concatenating.)\n\nThe `final_ans` will be the answer.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   **Empty `ti`**: If `ti` is empty, `new_val_di` remains `0` and `new_len_di` remains `0`. This correctly models replacing a digit with an empty string.\n*   **Leading zeros**: The problem states \"ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\" Our calculation naturally handles this. If `s` becomes \"007\", its value is 7. If `s` becomes \"\", its value is 0. If `s` is \"0\", its value is 0. `final_ans` will be 0 if the string evaluates to 0.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (222, 2->0, 0->7):**\n`s = \"222\"`, `n = 2`\nQueries:\n1. `2->0`\n2. `0->7`\n\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n\n**Initial state (after all queries):**\n`val = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\n`length = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\n**Reverse Query 2: `0->7`**\n`di = '0'`, `ti = \"7\"`\n`new_val_0 = 0`, `new_len_0 = 0`\nProcessing `ti=\"7\"` (right to left, only '7'):\n  `c = '7'`\n  `digit_val = val[7] = 7`\n  `digit_len = length[7] = 1`\n  `new_val_0 = (0 + 7 * pow(10, 0, MOD)) % MOD = 7`\n  `new_len_0 = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\nUpdate: `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`\nCurrent `val`: `[7,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\nCurrent `length`: `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\n**Reverse Query 1: `2->0`**\n`di = '2'`, `ti = \"0\"`\n`new_val_2 = 0`, `new_len_2 = 0`\nProcessing `ti=\"0\"` (right to left, only '0'):\n  `c = '0'`\n  `digit_val = val[0] = 7` (This is the *updated* `val[0]` from the previous step)\n  `digit_len = length[0] = 1`\n  `new_val_2 = (0 + 7 * pow(10, 0, MOD)) % MOD = 7`\n  `new_len_2 = (0 + 1) % (MOD - 1) = 1`\nUpdate: `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`\nCurrent `val`: `[7,1,7,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`\nCurrent `length`: `[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`\n\n**Final Calculation for `s=\"222\"`:**\n`final_ans = 0`\n`c = '2'` (first '2' in \"222\")\n  `digit_val = val[2] = 7`\n  `digit_len = length[2] = 1`\n  `final_ans = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = 7`\n`c = '2'` (second '2' in \"222\")\n  `digit_val = val[2] = 7`\n  `digit_len = length[2] = 1`\n  `final_ans = (7 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = (70 + 7) % MOD = 77`\n`c = '2'` (third '2' in \"222\")\n  `digit_val = val[2] = 7`\n  `digit_len = length[2] = 1`\n  `final_ans = (77 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 7) % MOD = (770 + 7) % MOD = 777`\n\nResult: `777`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Initialization**: O(10)\n*   **Processing queries**: `n` queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. The sum of lengths of `ti` is `N_T`. So, this step is O(N_T).\n*   **Final calculation**: Iterate through initial string `s`. Length of `s` is `|s|`. So, this step is O(|s|).\n*   `pow(10, exp, MOD)` takes O(log exp) time. Since `exp` can be up to `MOD-2`, this is O(log MOD).\n*   Total time complexity: O(N_T * log MOD + |s| * log MOD). Given `N_T, |s| <= 10^5` and `MOD ~ 10^9`, `log MOD ~ 30`. So, `10^5 * 30` operations, which is efficient enough.\n*   Space complexity: O(N_T + |s|) to store queries and the initial string, plus O(10) for `val` and `length` arrays. This is also well within limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        d_char, t_str = line.split(\"->\")\n        queries.append((d_char, t_str))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n\n    # Initialize val and length arrays\n    # val[d] stores the numerical value of digit d\n    # length[d] stores the length of the string digit d represents\n    # Initially, each digit d represents itself, with length 1\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        d_char, t_str = queries[i]\n        d_int = int(d_char)\n\n        new_val_d = 0\n        new_len_d = 0\n\n        # Iterate through t_str from right to left to correctly calculate positional value\n        for char_t in reversed(t_str):\n            char_t_int = int(char_t)\n            \n            # The value contributed by char_t is val[char_t_int]\n            # shifted left by new_len_d positions (multiplied by 10^new_len_d)\n            term_val = val[char_t_int]\n            term_len = length[char_t_int]\n\n            # Calculate new_val_d\n            # new_val_d = (current_new_val_d + term_val * 10^new_len_d) % MOD\n            new_val_d = (new_val_d + term_val * pow(10, new_len_d, MOD)) % MOD\n            \n            # Calculate new_len_d\n            # new_len_d = (current_new_len_d + term_len) % (MOD - 1)\n            # Lengths are exponents, so they are modulo MOD-1 by Fermat's Little Theorem\n            new_len_d = (new_len_d + term_len) % (MOD - 1)\n        \n        # Update val and length for the digit d_int\n        val[d_int] = new_val_d\n        length[d_int] = new_len_d\n\n    # Calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the original string s from left to right\n    for char_s in s:\n        char_s_int = int(char_s)\n        \n        # The value contributed by char_s is val[char_s_int]\n        # shifted left by the total length accumulated so far (multiplied by 10^length[char_s_int])\n        term_val = val[char_s_int]\n        term_len = length[char_s_int]\n\n        # final_ans = (current_final_ans * 10^term_len + term_val) % MOD\n        final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, term_len, MOD) + term_val) % MOD\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
