For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this competitive programming problem and formulate a Python solution.** My main goal is to count the ways to set up these `c_s` values for binary strings, making sure the biggest \"beautiful multiset\" has a specific size, `f`. I'm thinking of this problem as a kind of dynamic programming on a trie structure, where each node in the trie represents a binary string.\n\nFirst, I need to get a grip on what makes a multiset \"beautiful.\" The size of the multiset, basically the total number of strings, hinges on the `c_s` values. Each `c_s` limits how many strings with `s` as a prefix can be in the multiset. This suggests that maximizing the multiset's size means fitting as many strings as possible under these `c_s` constraints.  I'm interpreting it as a maximum flow or greedy problem where `dp[s]` will be the maximum count of prefixes possible.\n\nI'm starting to think about a recursive function, `dp[s]`, which will give the maximum number of strings that start with the prefix `s`. The constraints, or `c_s` values, come into play here. For leaves in the trie (strings of length `n`), `dp[s]` is just the corresponding `c_s`. For any internal node, `dp[s]` is the smaller of `c_s` and the sum of `dp` values of its two children. To optimize, I need to choose the best `c_s` at each depth, respecting the maximum `f` we're given.\n\nI'm leaning towards defining a `dp[d][mask]` or `dp[d][i]` table, with `d` for depth and `mask`/`i` being a bit representation of the prefix at that depth, but this might be more complex than necessary. So, the total number of combinations might be large because there are so many `c_s` values to consider, so I need to find a way to minimize the number of computations.\n\nA key idea is to use dynamic programming on a tree. I define a function `F[d][val]` to count the possible `c_s` assignments within a subtree. `F[d][val]` will be the number of ways to pick the `c_x` values in the subtree rooted at a depth-d node such that the `dp[s]` of the parent is `val`.  My recursive relation considers a convolution;  I am going to use NTT to speed up the convolution because it might become a bottleneck. The key is to connect `F[d][val]` with `F[d+1]` and ensure that the total maximum size is bounded by `f`.  The final solution is `F[1][0] + F[1][1]` which represents the total ways we get maximum size of f.\n\nGiven that `f` is restricted, I can limit the size of this `F` array. Specifically, the convolution will have at most a size of `2*f`. This gives me some confidence that this approach is feasible. I also need to make sure I am doing calculations modulo 998244353. The key is going to be the efficient NTT implementation. I need to make sure I'm using suffix sums to make sure computations are fast. This is the optimal approach for this problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for every binary string $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $f$. We need to output this count modulo $998244353$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the $c_s$ values. A multiset of binary strings of length $n$ is beautiful if for every string $s$ (length $1$ to $n$), the number of strings in the multiset having $s$ as a prefix does not exceed $c_s$.\nLet $dp[s]$ be the maximum possible number of strings in a beautiful multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nIf $s$ has length $n$, then $s$ is a string in the multiset itself. The number of times $s$ can appear is limited by $c_s$. So, $dp[s] = c_s$.\nIf $s$ has length $L < n$, then any string in the multiset having $s$ as a prefix must either have $s0$ as a prefix or $s1$ as a prefix. Thus, the total count for $s$ is the sum of counts for $s0$ and $s1$. This sum is also limited by $c_s$. Therefore, $dp[s] = \\min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])$.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum size of a beautiful multiset, which means the total number of strings of length $n$. Since $c_s$ are given for $s$ of length $1$ to $n$, the top-level constraints are $c_0$ and $c_1$. The total maximum size is $dp[0] + dp[1]$.\n\nWe need to count ways to choose $c_s$ such that $dp[0] + dp[1] = f$.\nSince $n$ is small ($n \\le 15$) and $f, k$ can be large ($2 \\cdot 10^5$), this suggests a dynamic programming approach where the state depends on $f$.\n\nLet $F[d][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_x$ for all strings $x$ in the subtree rooted at a generic node $s$ of depth $d$ (i.e., $s$ is a prefix of $x$, $len(x) \\ge d$), such that $dp[s]$ evaluates to $val$.\nWe only care about $val \\le f$, because if $dp[s] > f$ for any $s$ of length 1, then $dp[0]+dp[1]$ will be greater than $f$. More precisely, if $dp[s]$ is the maximum count for a prefix $s$, and we want $dp[0]+dp[1]=f$, then $dp[s]$ for any $s$ of length $d$ cannot exceed $f \\cdot 2^{n-d}$. However, a tighter bound is simply $f$, since $dp[s]$ is an upper bound on how many strings *could* be under $s$. If we want the total to be $f$, then no single $dp[s]$ can be more than $f$.\n\nThe DP proceeds from bottom-up (from depth $n$ to depth $1$):\n\n**Base Case: $d=n$**\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $dp[s] = c_s$. We choose $c_s$ from $0$ to $k$.\nSo, $dp[s]$ can be any value from $0$ to $k$.\n$F[n][val] = 1$ for $0 \\le val \\le \\min(k, f)$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step: $d$ from $n-1$ down to $1$**\nTo compute $F[d][val]$ based on $F[d+1]$:\nFor a generic node $s$ at depth $d$, its children $s0$ and $s1$ are at depth $d+1$.\n$dp[s] = \\min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])$.\nLet $val_0 = dp[s0]$ and $val_1 = dp[s1]$.\nThe number of ways to get $dp[s0]=val_0$ is $F[d+1][val_0]$.\nThe number of ways to get $dp[s1]=val_1$ is $F[d+1][val_1]$.\nSince the choices for $s0$'s subtree and $s1$'s subtree are independent, the number of ways to get $(dp[s0], dp[s1]) = (val_0, val_1)$ is $F[d+1][val_0] \\cdot F[d+1][val_1]$.\n\nLet $S_C = val_0 + val_1$. We define $G[d+1][S_C]$ as the number of ways to choose $c_x$ for subtrees of $s0$ and $s1$ such that $dp[s0] + dp[s1] = S_C$.\nThis is a convolution: $G[d+1][S_C] = \\sum_{val_0 + val_1 = S_C} F[d+1][val_0] \\cdot F[d+1][val_1]$.\nThe maximum value for $val_0, val_1$ is $f$, so $S_C$ can go up to $2f$. We can compute $G[d+1]$ using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) in $O(f \\log f)$ time.\n\nOnce $G[d+1]$ is computed, we can find $F[d][val]$:\n$F[d][val] = \\sum_{S_C} G[d+1][S_C] \\cdot (\\text{number of ways to choose } c_s \\text{ s.t. } \\min(c_s, S_C) = val)$.\nWe need to choose $c_s$ such that $0 \\le c_s \\le k$.\n1. If $val < S_C$: We must choose $c_s = val$. There is only $1$ way.\n2. If $val = S_C$: We must choose $c_s \\ge val$. The possible values for $c_s$ are $val, val+1, \\ldots, k$. There are $(k - val + 1)$ ways.\n3. If $val > S_C$: This is impossible, as $\\min(c_s, S_C)$ cannot be greater than $S_C$.\n\nSo, $F[d][val] = \\left( \\sum_{S_C = val+1}^{2f} G[d+1][S_C] \\cdot 1 \\right) + G[d+1][val] \\cdot (k - val + 1)$.\nThe sum can be efficiently computed using suffix sums of $G[d+1]$. Let $SuffixSumG[X] = \\sum_{i=X}^{2f} G[d+1][i]$.\nThen $F[d][val] = (SuffixSumG[val+1] + G[d+1][val] \\cdot (k - val + 1)) \\pmod{MOD}$.\nWe compute $F[d][val]$ for $0 \\le val \\le f$.\n\n**Final Step:**\nAfter computing $F[1][val]$ for $0 \\le val \\le f$:\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $dp[0] + dp[1]$.\nWe need to find the number of ways such that $dp[0] + dp[1] = f$.\nThis is again a convolution: $\\sum_{val_0 + val_1 = f} F[1][val_0] \\cdot F[1][val_1]$.\nLet $FinalG[X] = \\sum_{val_0 + val_1 = X} F[1][val_0] \\cdot F[1][val_1]$.\nThe answer is $FinalG[f]$. This can also be computed using NTT.\n\n**Complexity:**\nThere are $n-1$ recursive steps (from $d=n-1$ down to $1$). Each step involves one NTT convolution of size up to $2f$.\nThe maximum required NTT size is $2f+1$. Let $N_{FFT}$ be the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to $2f+1$.\nThe time complexity for each step is $O(N_{FFT} \\log N_{FFT})$.\nTotal time complexity: $O(n \\cdot N_{FFT} \\log N_{FFT})$.\nGiven $n=15, f=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $N_{FFT}$ would be $2^{19} = 524288$.\n$15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot \\log(524288) \\approx 15 \\cdot 524288 \\cdot 19 \\approx 1.5 \\cdot 10^8$. This is acceptable for typical competitive programming time limits (e.g. 2-3 seconds).\n\n**Modulo Arithmetic and NTT:**\nThe modulus is $998244353$, which is a prime number of the form $c \\cdot 2^x + 1$ (specifically $119 \\cdot 2^{23} + 1$). This means it's suitable for NTT. The primitive root modulo $998244353$ is $3$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\ndef ntt(a, inverse):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        len_half *= 2\n        w_n = pow(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // len_half, MOD)\n        if inverse:\n            w_n = pow(w_n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n        for i in range(0, n, len_half):\n            w = 1\n            for k in range(len_half // 2):\n                u = a[i + k]\n                v = (a[i + k + len_half // 2] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + k] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + k + len_half // 2] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_n) % MOD\n\n    if inverse:\n        inv_n = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * inv_n) % MOD\n    return a\n\ndef multiply_polys(p1, p2):\n    deg1 = len(p1)\n    deg2 = len(p2)\n    \n    res_deg = deg1 + deg2 - 1\n    \n    n_fft = 1\n    while n_fft < res_deg:\n        n_fft <<= 1\n    \n    a = list(p1) + [0] * (n_fft - deg1)\n    b = list(p2) + [0] * (n_fft - deg2)\n    \n    ntt(a, False)\n    ntt(b, False)\n    \n    c = [(x * y) % MOD for x, y in zip(a, b)]\n    \n    ntt(c, True)\n    \n    return c[:res_deg]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # F[d][val] stores the number of ways for a generic node at depth d\n    # to have dp[s] = val.\n    # Max val for F[d] is f.\n    # Max val for S_C (sum_children) is 2*f.\n    \n    # Base case: d = n\n    # F[n][val] = 1 for 0 <= val <= min(k, f)\n    current_F = [0] * (f + 1)\n    for val in range(min(k, f) + 1):\n        current_F[val] = 1\n    \n    # DP from d = n-1 down to 1\n    for d in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # Calculate G[d+1] = F[d+1] * F[d+1] (convolution)\n        # Max degree of F[d+1] is f.
