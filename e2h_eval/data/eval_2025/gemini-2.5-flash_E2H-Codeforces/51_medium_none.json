Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solution Path for \"Amusing Joke\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Amusing Joke\" problem, and I need a Python solution. The core idea seems pretty straightforward: determine if the letters in the pile are just a scrambled version of the guest's and host's names combined.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nLet's break it down. I'm given three strings: the guest's name, the host's name, and a pile of letters. The question is: can I perfectly recreate the pile's letters by combining the guest's and host's names and then jumbling the order? That is, the letters in the pile *must* be identical, in total quantity, to the combined names.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\nImportantly, I'm only dealing with uppercase Latin letters and the strings aren't empty, with a maximum length of 100 characters. These are nice constraints; it keeps things manageable.\n\n**Approach Options:**\n\nGiven the constraints, I could use a couple of effective methods.\n\n*   **Method 1: Sorting:** The simplest approach is to concatenate the guest's and host's names, and then sort that string. I can also sort the pile of letters. If the sorted strings are identical, it's a \"YES\", otherwise \"NO.\" Sorting is often the quickest, clearest method for these kinds of anagram problems.\n*   **Method 2: Counting:** I could create frequency maps (dictionaries or `collections.Counter`) for both the combined names and the pile. Then, I can compare the counts for each letter. If the counts match, it's a \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\nSince the lengths are up to 100, both methods are viable and efficient. However, the sorting method is often slightly more concise in Python. So let's go with that.\n\n**Detailed Steps (Sorting):**\n\n1.  Read the guest's name from standard input.\n2.  Read the host's name from standard input.\n3.  Read the pile of letters from standard input.\n4.  Combine the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n5.  Sort the combined string.\n6.  Sort the pile of letters.\n7.  Compare the sorted strings. If they're equal, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\".\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    guest_name = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host_name = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile_letters = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    combined_names = guest_name + host_name\n\n    # Sort both strings and compare\n    if sorted(combined_names) == sorted(pile_letters):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n**Testing & Edge Cases:**\n\nI've tested it mentally with a couple of examples. Also, the problem conditions eliminate concerns about empty strings. It also covers the edge case where the strings have the same letters, but different quantities and orders (a simple test to confirm sorting works). The `sorted()` comparison implicitly handles length differences, which is important.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nI've used `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` for potentially faster I/O, which is a good habit. Sorting is efficient and clean for this problem. The code seems robust and accurate. This should be a good solution.\n",
