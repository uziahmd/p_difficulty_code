Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan to solve this \"X\" grid problem.** I need to write a Python script that takes an `n x n` grid of characters as input and determines if it forms a valid \"X\" shape based on specific rules. The rules are pretty straightforward: the diagonals must have the same character, the non-diagonal cells must also have the same character, and these two characters must be different.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. I expect an odd integer `n` (between 3 and 299) on the first line, followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` lowercase letters. I'll store this grid as a 2D list.\n\nThen, I'll initialize two variables: `diag_char` and `non_diag_char`, both initially `None`. These will store the expected characters for the diagonals and non-diagonals, respectively.\n\nNext, I'll iterate through each cell of the grid using nested loops (rows and columns). Inside the loop, I'll check if the current cell is on either of the two diagonals. The diagonal cells are those where the row index equals the column index (`row == col`) or the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1` (`row + col == n - 1`).\n\nIf a cell is on a diagonal, I'll check its character against `diag_char`. If `diag_char` is still `None`, I'll set it to the current cell's character. If `diag_char` already has a value and it doesn't match the current cell's character, I know the grid isn't a valid \"X,\" so I'll print \"NO\" and exit.\n\nIf a cell is *not* on a diagonal, I'll do the same thing with `non_diag_char`: initialize it if it's `None`, or check if it matches the current cell's character. If there's a mismatch, I'll print \"NO\" and exit.\n\nAfter iterating through the entire grid, if I haven't exited already, I need to perform a final check. I must ensure that `diag_char` and `non_diag_char` are *different*. If they are the same, it's not a valid \"X,\" so I'll print \"NO.\" Otherwise, the grid forms a valid \"X,\" and I'll print \"YES.\"\n\nI've thought through some edge cases. Since `n` is always odd, the center cell is always on both diagonals, but my logic handles this naturally. If `n=3`, the diagonals are: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2) and the non-diagonals are: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nI will use Python to make my code. I will also use `sys.stdin.readline()` and `sys.stdout.write()` instead of `input()` and `print()` in case this is running in a competitive programming environment, because it can be faster. I'll make sure to `strip()` the newline character when reading input. My algorithm is O(N^2) which is fine given the small constraint on `N`.\n\nMy overall strategy is to verify that all the cells that should be the same, ARE. If at any point I encounter a violation, I exit immediately and print \"NO.\" I only print \"YES\" if I get to the end without finding any violations and, at that point, the diagonals and non-diagonals are different.",
