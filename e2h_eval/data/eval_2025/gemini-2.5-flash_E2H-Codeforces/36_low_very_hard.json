The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Radio Towers Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Radio Towers\" problem, and I need a Python solution. Let me walk through my thought process.  First, the setup: we have towns from 0 to n+1, with the actual towers potentially in towns 1 to n. Each tower is built with a 50% chance, and if it's there, it has a power level between 1 and n.  That power determines the range of towns it covers.\n\nThe key constraints are the signal limitations: towns 0 and n+1 can't get any signal, and towns 1 through n have to be covered by *exactly* one tower each.  The no-signal rule for towns 0 and n+1 essentially constrains the power levels. For town 0, the tower's position `i` must have a power `p_i` where `p_i <= i`. Similarly, for town n+1, `p_i <= (n+1) - i`.  Combining these, the maximum power any tower at town `i` can have is the minimum of `i` and `(n+1) - i`. Let's call that `P_max(i)`.\n\nNow, the really tricky part is constraint 2.  The intervals covered by each tower (basically a range defined by position and power) have to perfectly cover the towns 1 through n without overlap. This means we have to find a set of tower positions and power levels that form a nice, non-overlapping partition. Each town must be within exactly one tower's coverage zone.\n\nSo the problem boils down to efficiently finding combinations of tower positions and powers that satisfy these partition rules, and considering the probabilistic nature of the towers existing in the first place. This definitely feels like a dynamic programming or backtracking problem to me. I need to figure out how to model the coverage intervals and efficiently check for overlap. I'll probably need to consider building the tower assignments incrementally, ensuring each added tower doesn't create overlaps and ultimately covers all the necessary towns. I should be able to leverage the `P_max(i)` limit to significantly reduce the search space. Let's see if I can translate this into some Python code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the probability that, given $n$ potential tower locations (towns $1$ to $n$), a valid assignment of signal powers exists for the towers that are built. A tower is built at each location $1, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$, independently.\n\nThe constraints for a valid signal power assignment are:\n1.  Towns $0$ and $n+1$ must not receive any signal.\n2.  Towns $1, \\dots, n$ must each receive a signal from exactly one tower.\n\nLet's analyze the signal range. A tower at town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$. This means it covers towns in the interval $(i-p, i+p)$, specifically integer points $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$.\n\n**Constraint 1 implications:**\n*   To avoid town $0$ receiving a signal, for any tower at $i$ with power $p_i$, we must have $i-p_i+1 > 0$, which implies $p_i \\le i$.\n*   To avoid town $n+1$ receiving a signal, for any tower at $i$ with power $p_i$, we must have $i+p_i-1 < n+1$, which implies $p_i \\le (n+1)-i$.\n*   Combining these, any tower at town $i$ must have its power $p_i$ satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, (n+1)-i)$. If this condition holds, the tower only covers towns within the range $[1, n]$.\n\n**Constraint 2 implications:**\nThis constraint is about partitioning the set of towns $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ among the active towers. If a tower is at town $i$ with power $p_i$, it covers $2p_i-1$ towns: $i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1$.\nFor all towns $1, \\dots, n$ to be covered exactly once, the union of these intervals must be exactly $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, and the intervals must be disjoint.\nThe total number of towns covered must be $n$. So, $\\sum_{i \\in S} (2p_i-1) = n$, where $S$ is the set of towns with towers.\n\nConsider two towers at $i$ and $j$ with $i < j$. If they cover disjoint intervals, say tower $i$ covers $[L_i, R_i]$ and tower $j$ covers $[L_j, R_j]$, then $R_i < L_j$.\nThe interval covered by tower $i$ is $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$. The interval covered by tower $j$ is $[j-p_j+1, j+p_j-1]$.\nFor these to be disjoint, $i+p_i-1 < j-p_j+1$.\nFor these to form a partition, they must be adjacent: $i+p_i-1 = j-p_j$.\nThis means the town $j-p_j$ (the rightmost town covered by tower $i$) is immediately followed by $j-p_j+1$ (the leftmost town covered by tower $j$).\n\nThis structure implies that if towers are built at $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$, and they are assigned powers $p_{i_1}, \\dots, p_{i_k}$ such that all conditions are met, then:\n1.  The first tower $i_1$ must cover towns $1, \\dots, 2p_{i_1}-1$. This means $i_1-p_{i_1}+1 = 1$, so $p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n2.  The last tower $i_k$ must cover towns $n-(2p_{i_k}-1)+1, \\dots, n$. This means $i_k+p_{i_k}-1 = n$, so $p_{i_k} = n-i_k+1$.\n3.  For any two adjacent towers $i_j$ and $i_{j+1}$, the interval covered by $i_j$ must end just before the interval covered by $i_{j+1}$ begins. That is, $(i_j+p_{i_j}-1) + 1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\n    This simplifies to $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$.\n\nCombining these with $p_x \\le \\min(x, n-x+1)$:\n*   For $p_{i_1}=i_1$, we need $i_1 \\le \\min(i_1, n-i_1+1)$, which means $i_1 \\le n-i_1+1$, or $2i_1 \\le n+1$.\n*   For $p_{i_k}=n-i_k+1$, we need $n-i_k+1 \\le \\min(i_k, n-i_k+1)$, which means $n-i_k+1 \\le i_k$, or $n+1 \\le 2i_k$.\n\nThe condition $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1$ implies $i_{j+1}-i_j = p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}-1$.\nSince $p_x \\ge 1$, we have $p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}-1 \\ge 1+1-1=1$.\nAlso, $p_x \\le x$ and $p_x \\le n-x+1$.\nIf we set $p_x = x - (i_j+p_{i_j}-1)$ for $x > i_j$, this indicates a relationship between the tower position and its assigned power.\n\nA key observation for such problems is often related to \"distances\" or \"gaps\".\nLet $S = \\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the set of towns with towers, sorted $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$.\nFor a valid assignment of powers to exist:\n1.  For each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, we must be able to assign $p_{i_j}$ such that $1 \\le p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n-i_j+1)$.\n2.  The intervals covered must partition $[1, n]$.\nThis implies that the range covered by tower $i_j$ is $[L_j, R_j]$ where $L_1=1$, $R_k=n$, and $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nThe length of the interval covered by tower $i_j$ is $2p_{i_j}-1$.\nSo $R_j - L_j + 1 = 2p_{i_j}-1$.\nAlso, $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$. This means $L_j+R_j$ must be even, so $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nSince $L_1=1$ (odd), all $L_j$ must be odd. Since $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$, all $R_j$ must be even.\nThis means $2p_{i_j}-1$ must be odd, which is always true for integer $p_{i_j}$.\nThe condition $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ means $i_j$ is exactly the midpoint of its covered interval.\nThis implies $p_{i_j} = i_j - L_j + 1 = R_j - i_j + 1$.\nFrom $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$, we get $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = (i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1)-1$, so $i_j+p_{i_j} = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nThis is equivalent to $i_{j+1}-i_j = p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}$. This is a critical condition.\nAlso $L_1=1 \\implies p_{i_1}=i_1$.\nAnd $R_k=n \\implies p_{i_k}=n-i_k+1$.\n\nSubstituting these into $i_{j+1}-i_j = p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}$:\nFor $j=1$: $i_2-i_1 = p_{i_1}+p_{i_2} = i_1+p_{i_2}$. So $i_2 = 2i_1+p_{i_2}$.\nFor $j=k-1$: $i_k-i_{k-1} = p_{i_{k-1}}+p_{i_k} = p_{i_{k-1}}+n-i_k+1$. So $i_k-i_{k-1} = p_{i_{k-1}}+n-i_k+1$.\n\nThis system of equations and inequalities has a unique solution for $p_j$ given the tower locations $i_j$.\nThe crucial part is that for this system to have a solution, the chosen tower locations $i_j$ must satisfy certain properties.\nThe condition $i_{j+1}-i_j = p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}}$ means that the distance between two adjacent towers must be the sum of their assigned powers.\nConsider the $p_j$ values: $p_1=i_1$, $p_k=n-i_k+1$.\nFor $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $p_{j+1} = i_{j+1}-i_j-p_j$.\nThis implies that $p_j$ values are uniquely determined by $i_1, \\dots, i_k$.\nThe only remaining conditions are $1 \\le p_j \\le \\min(i_j, n-i_j+1)$ for all $j$.\nIt turns out that $p_j \\ge 1$ is always true if $i_{j+1}-i_j \\ge 2$ and $i_1 \\ge 1, n-i_k+1 \\ge 1$.\nThe conditions $p_j \\le i_j$ and $p_j \\le n-i_j+1$ are the main ones.\n\nLet's look at the example $n=5$.\nTowers at $2, 4, 5$. So $i_1=2, i_2=4, i_3=5$.\n$p_1 = i_1 = 2$. Valid since $2 \\le \\min(2, 5-2+1=4)$.\n$p_3 = n-i_3+1 = 5-5+1 = 1$. Valid since $1 \\le \\min(5, 5-5+1=1)$.\n$i_2-i_1 = p_1+p_2 \\implies 4-2 = 2+p_2 \\implies 2 = 2+p_2 \\implies p_2=0$. This is not allowed ($p_j \\ge 1$).\nSo towers at $2,4,5$ is not a valid configuration. The example is wrong or my interpretation of $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ is too strict.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ part.\nThe problem states \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\".\nThis means the intervals $(i-p_i, i+p_i)$ must partition the set of towns $1, \\dots, n$.\nThe covered towns are $i-p_i+1, \\dots, i+p_i-1$.\nLet $S = \\{t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k\\}$ be the set of towns with towers, $t_1 < t_2 < \\dots < t_k$.\nLet $P = \\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k\\}$ be their assigned powers.\nThe conditions are:\n1. $1 \\le p_j \\le \\min(t_j, n-t_j+1)$ for all $j$.\n2. The union of intervals $[t_j-p_j+1, t_j+p_j-1]$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$ is exactly $[1, n]$.\n3. These intervals are disjoint.\n\nCondition 2 and 3 together mean that the intervals must be adjacent and cover the entire range.\nSo, $t_1-p_1+1 = 1 \\implies p_1 = t_1$.\n$t_k+p_k-1 = n \\implies p_k = n-t_k+1$.\nAnd for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$: $t_j+p_j-1 = t_{j+1}-p_{j+1}$.\nThis is the correct set of conditions.\nSubstituting $p_1=t_1$ and $p_k=n-t_k+1$ into the adjacency conditions:\n$t_j+p_j-1 = t_{j+1}-p_{j+1}$\nThis implies $p_{j+1} = t_{j+1}-t_j+1-p_j$.\nWe can compute all $p_j$ values iteratively:\n$p_1=t_1$\n$p_2 = t_2-t_1+1-p_1 = t_2-2t_1+1$\n$p_3 = t_3-t_2+1-p_2 = t_3-t_2+1-(t_2-2t_1+1) = t_3-2t_2+2t_1$\nIn general, $p_j = t_j - t_{j-1} + 1 - p_{j-1}$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$.\nThe final condition is $p_k = n-t_k+1$. This must be consistent with the iteratively computed $p_k$.\nSo, $n-t_k+1 = t_k-t_{k-1}+1-p_{k-1}$.\nThis means $n-t_k = t_k-t_{k-1}-p_{k-1}$.\nAlso, all $p_j$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_j \\le \\min(t_j, n-t_j+1)$.\n\nLet's test $n=5$, towers $2,4,5$: $t_1=2, t_2=4, t_3=5$.\n$p_1 = t_1 = 2$.\n$p_2 = t_2-t_1+1-p_1 = 4-2+1-2 = 1$.\n$p_3 = t_3-t_2+1-p_2 = 5-4+1-1 = 1$.\nCheck final condition: $p_k = n-t_k+1 \\implies p_3 = 5-5+1 = 1$. This matches!\nCheck $1 \\le p_j \\le \\min(t_j, n-t_j+1)$:\n$p_1=2$: $1 \\le 2 \\le \\min(2, 5-2+1=4)$. Valid.\n$p_2=1$: $1 \\le 1 \\le \\min(4, 5-4+1=2)$. Valid.\n$p_3=1$: $1 \\le 1 \\le \\min(5, 5-5+1=1)$. Valid.\nSo, towers at $2,4,5$ for $n=5$ *is* a valid configuration.\nTown $2$ with power $2$ covers $[2-2+1, 2+2-1] = [1,3]$.\nTown $4$ with power $1$ covers $[4-1+1, 4+1-1] = [4,4]$.\nTown $5$ with power $1$ covers $[5-1+1, 5+1-1] = [5,5]$.\nUnion is $[1,3] \\cup [4,4] \\cup [5,5] = [1,5]$. All conditions met.\n\nThe conditions for a configuration $S=\\{t_1, \\dots, t_k\\}$ to be valid are:\n1. $p_1 = t_1$\n2. $p_j = t_j - t_{j-1} + 1 - p_{j-1}$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$.\n3. $p_k = n-t_k+1$.\n4. $1 \\le p_j \\le \\min(t_j, n-t_j+1)$ for all $j=1, \\dots, k$.\n\nLet $x_j = t_j-t_{j-1}$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$, and $x_1=t_1$.\nThen $p_1=x_1$.\n$p_j = x_j+1-p_{j-1}$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$.\nThis implies $p_j+p_{j-1} = x_j+1$.\nSo $p_j$ alternates in parity: $p_j \\equiv x_j+1-p_{j-1} \\pmod 2$.\n$p_1 = t_1$.\n$p_2 = t_2-t_1+1-t_1 = t_2-2t_1+1$.\n$p_3 = t_3-t_2+1-p_2 = t_3-t_2+1-(t_2-2t_1+1) = t_3-2t_2+2t_1$.\n$p_4 = t_4-t_3+1-p_3 = t_4-t_3+1-(t_3-2t_2+2t_1) = t_4-2t_3+2t_2-2t_1+1$.\nIn general, $p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^{j} (-1)^{j-m} (t_m - t_{m-1}) + C_j$ (where $t_0=0$).\nThis is $p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^{j} (-1)^{j-m} t_m + (-1)^{j-1} t_0 + \\sum_{m=2}^j (-1)^{j-m}$.\n$p_j = (-1)^{j-1}t_1 + (-1)^{j-2}(t_2-t_1) + \\dots + (t_j-t_{j-1}) + C_j$.\n$p_j = (-1)^{j-1}t_1 + (-1)^{j-2}t_2 - (-1)^{j-2}t_1 + \\dots$.\n$p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^{j} (-1)^{j-m} (t_m - t_{m-1}) + \\sum_{m=2}^j (-1)^{j-m}$.\n$p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^{j} (-1)^{j-m} (t_m - t_{m-1}) + \\sum_{l=0}^{j-2} (-1)^l$.\nThis sum is $1$ if $j-2$ is even, $0$ if $j-2$ is odd.\nSo $p_j = \\sum_{m=1}^{j} (-1)^{j-m} (t_m - t_{m-1}) + (j-1)\\%2$.\nWait, the formula $p_j = x_j+1-p_{j-1}$ is $p_j = (t_j-t_{j-1})+1-p_{j-1}$.\n$p_j = t_j - (t_{j-1}+p_{j-1}-1)$.\nThe condition $t_j+p_j-1 = t_{j+1}-p_{j+1}$ can be rewritten as $t_{j+1}-t_j = p_j+p_{j+1}-1$.\nThis is a standard recurrence for Fibonacci-like sequences.\nLet $d_j = t_j - t_{j-1}$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$. Let $d_1=t_1$.\nThen $p_1=d_1$.\n$p_j = d_j+1-p_{j-1}$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$.\nThe condition $p_k = n-t_k+1$ must hold.\n$p_k = n - (d_1+d_2+\\dots+d_k) + 1$.\nThis means $n+1 = \\sum_{j=1}^k d_j + p_k$.\nAlso, $p_j \\ge 1$ and $p_j \\le \\min(t_j, n-t_j+1)$.\nThe conditions $p_j \\ge 1$ and $p_j \\le t_j$ are equivalent to $t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1} \\ge 1 \\implies t_j-t_{j-1} \\ge p_{j-1}$ and $t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1} \\le t_j \\implies 1 \\le t_{j-1}+p_{j-1}$.\nThe condition $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ is equivalent to $t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1} \\le n-t_j+1 \\implies 2t_j-t_{j-1} \\le n+p_{j-1}$.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to counting sequences $t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$ such that:\n$1 \\le t_1 < t_2 < \\dots < t_k \\le n$.\n$p_1=t_1 \\ge 1$.\n$p_j = t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1} \\ge 1$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$.\n$p_j \\le t_j$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$.\n$p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$.\n$p_k = n-t_k+1$.\n\nThe recurrence $p_j = t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1}$ implies $p_j+p_{j-1} = t_j-t_{j-1}+1$.\nSumming this from $j=2$ to $k$:\n$(p_2+p_1) + (p_3+p_2) + \\dots + (p_k+p_{k-1}) = \\sum_{j=2}^k (t_j-t_{j-1}+1)$.\n$p_1+2\\sum_{j=2}^{k-1} p_j + p_k = (t_k-t_1) + (k-1)$.\nUsing $p_1=t_1$ and $p_k=n-t_k+1$:\n$t_1+2\\sum_{j=2}^{k-1} p_j + n-t_k+1 = t_k-t_1+k-1$.\n$2\\sum_{j=1}^{k} p_j - p_1 - p_k = (t_k-t_1) + (k-1)$.\n$2\\sum_{j=1}^{k} p_j = (t_k-t_1) + (k-1) + t_1 + n-t_k+1 = n+k$.\nSo, $\\sum_{j=1}^k p_j = (n+k)/2$.\nThis implies $n+k$ must be even. So $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n\nThe conditions $p_j \\ge 1$ and $p_j \\le t_j$ and $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ are crucial.\nThe sequence $p_j$ is determined by $t_j$.\n$p_j \\ge 1 \\iff t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1} \\ge 1 \\iff t_j-t_{j-1} \\ge p_{j-1}$.\nThis means $t_j-t_{j-1}$ must be at least $p_{j-1}$.\nAlso $p_j \\le t_j \\iff t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1} \\le t_j \\iff 1-p_{j-1} \\le t_{j-1} \\iff 1 \\le p_{j-1}+t_{j-1}$.\nSince $t_{j-1} \\ge 1$ and $p_{j-1} \\ge 1$, this condition $1 \\le p_{j-1}+t_{j-1}$ is always met.\nThe condition $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ is $t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1} \\le n-t_j+1 \\iff 2t_j-t_{j-1}-p_{j-1} \\le n$.\n\nThis set of conditions describes a valid configuration.\nThe crucial observation for this problem is that these conditions are satisfied if and only if the sequence of towers $t_1, \\dots, t_k$ forms a \"Fibonacci-like\" chain.\nSpecifically, if we define $f_0=0, f_1=1, f_2=1, f_3=2, f_4=3, \\dots$ (Fibonacci sequence starting $f_1=1, f_2=1$).\nA configuration is valid if and only if $k$ towers are built and $n+k$ is even, and for all $j=1, \\dots, k$, $t_j = \\sum_{m=1}^j p_m + \\sum_{m=1}^{j-1} p_m + (j-1)$.\nNo, this is too complicated.\n\nLet's look at the structure of the problem again.\nThe values $p_j$ are powers. $t_j$ are tower positions.\n$p_1=t_1$.\n$p_2=t_2-t_1+1-p_1 = t_2-2t_1+1$.\n$p_3=t_3-t_2+1-p_2 = t_3-t_2+1-(t_2-2t_1+1) = t_3-2t_2+2t_1$.\n$p_j = t_j - (t_{j-1} + p_{j-1} - 1)$.\nThis implies $p_j$ is determined by $t_1, \\dots, t_j$.\nThe condition $p_k = n-t_k+1$ is a global constraint.\nThe conditions $p_j \\ge 1$ and $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ are local constraints.\nThe condition $p_j \\le t_j$ is always satisfied if $p_{j-1} \\ge 1$ and $t_{j-1} \\ge 1$.\n\nSo, we need to count sequences $1 \\le t_1 < \\dots < t_k \\le n$ such that:\n1. $t_1 \\ge 1$.\n2. $p_j = t_j - t_{j-1} + 1 - p_{j-1} \\ge 1$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$. (with $p_1=t_1$)\n3. $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$.\n4. $p_k = n-t_k+1$. (This implies $p_k \\le n-t_k+1$ is met).\n\nLet $a_j = p_j$.\n$a_1=t_1$.\n$a_j = t_j-t_{j-1}+1-a_{j-1}$.\n$a_j \\ge 1$.\n$a_j \\le n-t_j+1$.\n$a_k = n-t_k+1$.\n\nConsider the sequence $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$.\n$p_1 = t_1$.\n$p_2 = t_2-t_1+1-p_1 = t_2-2t_1+1$.\n$p_3 = t_3-t_2+1-p_2 = t_3-2t_2+2t_1$.\nThis is $p_j = t_j - (t_{j-1} + p_{j-1} - 1)$.\nThe quantity $t_j + p_j - 1$ is the rightmost town covered by tower $j$.\nThe quantity $t_j - p_j + 1$ is the leftmost town covered by tower $j$.\nThe conditions are:\n$t_1-p_1+1 = 1 \\implies p_1=t_1$.\n$t_j+p_j-1 = t_{j+1}-p_{j+1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\n$t_k+p_k-1 = n$.\nAnd $p_j \\ge 1$.\nAnd $p_j \\le t_j$ (which is $t_j-p_j+1 \\ge 1$).\nAnd $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ (which is $t_j+p_j-1 \\le n$).\n\nThe conditions $t_j+p_j-1 = t_{j+1}-p_{j+1}$ and $p_1=t_1$ and $p_k=n-t_k+1$ uniquely determine the $p_j$ values based on $t_j$.\nThe remaining conditions are $p_j \\ge 1$ for all $j$, and $p_j \\le t_j$ for all $j$, and $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ for all $j$.\n$p_1=t_1 \\implies p_1 \\ge 1$ (since $t_1 \\ge 1$) and $p_1 \\le t_1$ (since $t_1 \\ge 1$).\n$p_k=n-t_k+1 \\implies p_k \\ge 1$ (since $t_k \\le n$) and $p_k \\le n-t_k+1$ (since $t_k \\le n$).\nSo we only need to check $p_j \\ge 1$ and $p_j \\le t_j$ and $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ for $j=2, \\dots, k-1$.\n\nLet's simplify $p_j \\le t_j$.\n$p_j = t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1} \\le t_j \\implies 1-p_{j-1} \\le t_{j-1} \\implies p_{j-1}+t_{j-1} \\ge 1$.\nSince $t_{j-1} \\ge 1$ and $p_{j-1} \\ge 1$, this is always true.\nSo the only active constraints are $p_j \\ge 1$ and $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ for $j=2, \\dots, k-1$.\nAnd the global consistency condition $p_k = n-t_k+1$.\n\nThis is a known pattern. The sequence of $p_j$ values can be related to Fibonacci numbers.\nLet $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nLet $x_j = t_j - (t_{j-1} + p_{j-1} - 1)$ be the value $p_j$ would take.\nThe condition $p_j \\ge 1$ means $t_j - t_{j-1} + 1 - p_{j-1} \\ge 1 \\implies t_j - t_{j-1} \\ge p_{j-1}$.\nThis means the distance between $t_j$ and $t_{j-1}$ must be at least $p_{j-1}$.\nThe condition $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ is equivalent to $t_j+p_j-1 \\le n$. This means the right end of the interval for $t_j$ must not exceed $n$.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to counting sequences of $k$ active towers $t_1, \\dots, t_k$ such that if we define $p_1=t_1$ and $p_j = t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1}$ for $j>1$, then $p_j \\ge 1$ for all $j$, and $p_k = n-t_k+1$.\nAnd for all $j$, $t_j+p_j-1 \\le n$. (This is $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$).\n\nThis is exactly the condition for a composition of $n$ using parts $2p_j-1$ where $p_j$ are derived from $t_j$.\nThe problem is famously related to Fibonacci numbers.\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ towers such that the conditions are met is $F_{n+1-k}$ if $k$ and $n$ have the same parity. If $k$ and $n$ have different parities, it's $0$.\nThe total number of ways to choose towers is $2^n$.\nSo we need to sum $F_{n+1-k}$ for valid $k$.\nA sequence of towers $t_1, \\dots, t_k$ is valid if and only if $t_1 \\ge 1$, $t_k \\le n$, $t_j - t_{j-1} \\ge 2$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$, and $t_1 \\pmod 2 = t_2 \\pmod 2 = \\dots = t_k \\pmod 2$.\nNo, this is not the condition. The condition $t_j-t_{j-1} \\ge p_{j-1}$ is not necessarily $t_j-t_{j-1} \\ge 2$.\nThe $p_j$ values are not fixed to 1. E.g., for $n=5$, towers $(2,4,5)$, $p_1=2, p_2=1, p_3=1$.\n$t_2-t_1 = 4-2=2$. $p_1=2$. So $t_2-t_1 \\ge p_1$ is $2 \\ge 2$, okay.\n$t_3-t_2 = 5-4=1$. $p_2=1$. So $t_3-t_2 \\ge p_2$ is $1 \\ge 1$, okay.\n\nA configuration of towers $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ is valid if and only if:\n1. If $S$ is empty, it's not valid (no towns $1..n$ covered).\n2. If $S = \\{t_1, \\dots, t_k\\}$ sorted, then $t_1 \\ge 1$, $t_k \\le n$.\n3. Define $p_1=t_1$, and $p_j = t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1}$ for $j=2, \\dots, k$.\n4. Check $p_j \\ge 1$ for all $j=1, \\dots, k$.\n5. Check $p_k = n-t_k+1$.\n6. Check $p_j \\le n-t_j+1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$. (The $k$-th check is already covered by point 5).\n\nThe crucial insight is that the sum of $p_j$ must be $(n+k)/2$.\nThis implies $n$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\nIf $S$ is empty, $k=0$. Then $n+0$ must be even. So $n$ must be even. But $n$ towns are not covered. So $S$ cannot be empty.\nSo $k \\ge 1$.\n\nConsider the values $p_j$.\n$p_1=t_1 \\ge 1$.\n$p_j = t_j-t_{j-1}+1-p_{j-1}$.\n$p_j \\ge 1 \\implies t_j-t_{j-1} \\ge p_{j-1}$.\n$p_k = n-t_k+1 \\ge 1$.\n\nThis is equivalent to counting sequences $x_1, \\dots, x_k$ where $x_j = p_j+p_{j+1}-1$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $x_0 = p_1-1$, $x_k = p_k-1$.\nThis is a problem that can be mapped to compositions of $n$ into parts $2p_j-1$.\nThe number of ways to choose towers such that a valid assignment exists is $F_{n+1}$.\nFor $n=1$: $F_2=1$.

Mismatch. Example output is $1/4$.\n\nThe example output for $n=2$ is $1/4$. My formula $F_{n+1}$ is wrong.\nThe problem states \"if $n=2$, towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$\". This is the only valid case.\n\nLet's re-examine the structure of the problem.\nThe problem is equivalent to counting \"stable\" partitions of $n$ into $k$ segments.\nThe number of ways to choose towers such that a valid assignment exists is $F_{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 2$, and $1$ for $n=1$.\nFor $n=1$: $F_{1-1}=F_0=0$.

Valid.\nTotal 2 valid configurations. Probability $2/8 = 1/4$.\nMy formula $F_{n+1}$ (for odd $n$) or $F_n$ (for even $n$) is still wrong.\n\nThe number of valid configurations is $F_{n}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nFor $n=1$: $F_1=1$. Prob $1/2$.

Compute $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$. This can be done using matrix exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n    The matrix for Fibonacci numbers is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    So if $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$, then $F_{k+1}=a, F_k=c$.\n    We need $F_n$. So we compute $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1}$ to get $F_n$.\n    If $n=1$, $F_1=1$. Matrix exponentiation for $n-1=0$ would give identity matrix, so $F_1=1$.\n2.  Compute $2^n \\pmod{998244353}$. This can be done using modular exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n3.  Compute the modular inverse of $2^n \\pmod{998244353}$. This is $(2^n)^{MOD-2} \\pmod{998244353}$ by Fermat's Little Theorem.\n4.  Multiply $F_n$ by $(2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\n**Matrix Exponentiation Details:**\nLet $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe want $M^{n-1}$.\n`matrix_mult(A, B)`: returns $A \\times B \\pmod{MOD}$.\n`matrix_pow(M, exp)`: returns $M^{exp} \\pmod{MOD}$ using binary exponentiation.\n\nBase case $n=1$: $F_1=1$. The loop for matrix exponentiation should handle $exp=0$ by returning identity matrix.\nIf $n=1$, we need $F_1=1$. $M^{1-1}=M^0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThen $F_1$ would be $c$ in the formula, but $F_k=c$ is for $k=exp$. So $F_{exp}=c$.\nSo $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\nIf $k=0$, $F_0=0$.\nIf $k=1$, $F_1=1$.\nThe standard definition for $F_n$ with matrix exponentiation is usually $\\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} \\\\ F_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWith $F_0=0, F_1=1$, this gives $\\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} \\\\ F_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo we need $M^n \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The bottom-left element of $M^n$ will be $F_n$.\nLet $M^n = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$. Then $c=F_n$.\nThis works for $n \\ge 1$.\nFor $n=1$, $M^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. $c=1=F_1$.\nFor $n=2$, $M^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. $c=1=F_2$.\nFor $n=3$, $M^3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. $c=2=F_3$.\n\n**MOD:** $998244353$. This is a prime number.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef matrix_mult(A, B):\n    C = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                C[i][j] = (C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD\n    return C\n\ndef matrix_pow(M, exp):\n    result = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n    base = M\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            result = matrix_mult(result, base)\n        base = matrix_mult(base, base)\n        exp //= 2\n    return result\n\ndef get_fibonacci_n(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # M = [[F_2, F_1], [F_1, F_0]] = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    # M^n = [[F_{n+1}, F_n], [F_n, F_{n-1}]]\n    # We want F_n, which is M^n[1][0]\n    \n    M = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    M_pow_n = matrix_pow(M, n)\n    return M_pow_n[1][0]\n\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef mod_inverse(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    fib_n = get_fibonacci_n(n)\n    \n    total_configs = power(2, n)\n    inv_total_configs = mod_inverse(total_configs)\n    \n    ans = (fib_n * inv_total_configs) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
