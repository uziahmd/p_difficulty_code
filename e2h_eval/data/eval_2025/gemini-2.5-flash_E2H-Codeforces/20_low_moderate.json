For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Core of the \"Multiset of Strings\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's see. This is a fascinating problem. My expert intuition tells me this screams a dynamic programming or possibly a clever combinatorial argument. We're dealing with binary strings, lengths up to `n`, and constraints. The heart of it seems to be understanding the relationship between prefixes and the counts.\n\nOkay, so we have binary strings, lengths from 1 to `n`. Each string `s` has an associated `c_s` value, ranging from `0` to `k`. The goal is to build a \"beautiful multiset\" `M` of strings *exactly* of length `n`. Beautiful means that the count of strings in `M` with a given string `s` as a prefix is at most `c_s`.  We're after the largest possible size of this multiset, which we'll call the maximum `|M|`. And then, the tricky part, we have to count how many different ways we can choose the values of all the `c_s` such that this maximum possible size is exactly a given `f`.  We need to do all this modulo 998244353.\n\nNow, let's dig into the *maximum* size of `M`. Thinking about this, a string `s` is a prefix of `s0` and `s1`. So, if a string in `M` has `s0` as a prefix, it *also* has `s` as a prefix. This gives me a strong hint about the structure of the problem. If `count(s)` is the number of strings in `M` with prefix `s`, then we have the following logic:  `count(s)` must be greater than or equal to the sum of the counts of all strings whose prefixes it is part of. We can model this problem by finding the maximum value of `sum(x_t)`, where each `x_t` represents the number of times a binary string `t` of length `n` is in the multiset `M`. This is a sort of flow-like problem. We have constraints like `count(s) <= c_s`. The `x_t` values are non-negative.\n\nIt seems like we can model this with the following constraints:\n1. `x_t >= 0` for all strings `t` of length `n`.\n2. For any string `s` of length `L < n`, the sum of all `x_t` where `s` is a prefix of `t`, must be at most `c_s`.\n3. For any string `s` of length `n`, `x_s <= c_s`.\n\nFrom here, a Python solution seems achievable. I'm going to formulate a dynamic programming approach to efficiently count the number of valid `c_s` values and determine the maximum size of the multiset. This looks like a fun one!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose values $c_s$ for all binary strings $s$ of length 1 to $n$, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful multiset\" is exactly $f$. Each $c_s$ must be between $0$ and $k$.\n\nFirst, let's understand what determines the maximum size of a beautiful multiset. A multiset $M$ consists of binary strings of length exactly $n$. Let $x_t$ be the count of string $t$ in $M$ for any binary string $t$ of length $n$. The total size of the multiset is $\\sum_{t \\text{ of length } n} x_t$.\nFor any string $s$ of length $L \\le n$, the condition is that the number of strings in $M$ having $s$ as a prefix must not exceed $c_s$. This count is $\\sum_{t \\text{ of length } n, s \\text{ is prefix of } t} x_t$.\n\nThis is a maximum flow problem, or more simply, a minimum cut problem. Consider a source $S$, a sink $T$. For each string $s$ of length $L < n$, create a node $U_s$. For each string $t$ of length $n$, create a node $V_t$.\nAdd edges $S \\to U_s$ with capacity $c_s$ for all $s$ of length $L < n$.\nAdd edges $V_t \\to T$ with capacity $c_t$ for all $t$ of length $n$. (Note: $c_t$ for $t$ of length $n$ is just $c_s$ where $s=t$).\nAdd edges $U_s \\to U_{s0}$ and $U_s \\to U_{s1}$ with infinite capacity, for all $s$ of length $L < n-1$.\nAdd edges $U_s \\to V_{s0}$ and $U_s \\to V_{s1}$ with infinite capacity, for all $s$ of length $n-1$.\nThe maximum flow (or minimum cut) in this network gives the maximum size of a beautiful multiset.\n\nA known result for this type of network structure (a tree-like structure where capacities are on nodes, and edges represent parent-child relationships) is that the maximum size is given by the following formula:\nLet $N_s = 2^{n - \\text{len}(s)}$ be the number of strings of length $n$ that have $s$ as a prefix.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset, let's call it $W$, is $\\sum_{s \\text{ of length } n} x_s$, where $x_s$ are non-negative integers satisfying:\nFor every string $s$ of length $L < n$, $\\sum_{t \\text{ with prefix } s} x_t \\le c_s$.\nFor every string $s$ of length $n$, $x_s \\le c_s$.\n\nThis specific structure implies that $W$ is equivalent to the maximum value of $\\sum_{s \\text{ of length } n} x_s$ subject to $x_s \\ge 0$ and\n$x_s \\le c_s$ for all $s$ of length $n$, and\n$\\sum_{s \\text{ with prefix } p} x_s \\le c_p$ for all $p$ of length $L < n$.\nThis is a standard minimum cut problem on a bipartite graph where one set of nodes represents prefixes and the other represents full strings, or more generally, a tree-like network.\nThe maximum possible size $W$ is given by:\n$W = \\min_{s \\text{ of length } L \\le n} \\left( c_s \\cdot N_s \\right)$, where $N_s = 2^{n - \\text{len}(s)}$ is the number of full-length strings that $s$ is a prefix of.\nFor $s$ of length $n$, $N_s=1$. So $c_s \\cdot N_s = c_s$.\nThis formula is incorrect. The correct one is:\n$W = \\sum_{s \\text{ of length } n} \\min(c_s, \\text{value determined by parents})$.\nMore precisely, $W = \\sum_{t \\text{ of length } n} x_t$, where $x_t$ is chosen greedily.\nFor each string $t$ of length $n$, $x_t$ can be at most $c_t$. Also, for each prefix $p$ of $t$, $x_t$ contributes to $c_p$.\nThe maximum possible size $W$ is given by:\n$W = \\sum_{t \\text{ of length } n} \\min_{p \\text{ is prefix of } t} \\left( \\lfloor c_p / N_{p,t} \\rfloor \\right)$ where $N_{p,t}$ is the number of strings of length $n$ that have $p$ as a prefix and are \"descendants\" of $p$ in the trie that are relevant to $t$.\nThis is still not quite right.\n\nLet's use a simpler, more direct approach for the max size $W$.\nThe maximum number of strings of length $n$ that can be chosen is $W$.\nFor any string $s$ of length $L < n$, let $W_s$ be the maximum number of strings of length $n$ which have $s$ as a prefix.\nThen $W_s \\le c_s$. Also, $W_s = W_{s0} + W_{s1}$.\nAt length $n$, $W_s = x_s \\le c_s$.\nThis means $W_s = \\min(c_s, W_{s0} + W_{s1})$ for $L < n$, and $W_s = \\min(c_s, \\text{something})$ for $L=n$.\nThe \"something\" for $L=n$ is just $x_s$. So $x_s = \\min(c_s, \\text{value from parent})$.\nThis is the structure of a dynamic programming problem on a trie (or segment tree).\nLet $dp[s]$ be the maximum count of strings of length $n$ that have $s$ as a prefix.\nFor a string $s$ of length $L=n$, $dp[s] = c_s$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $L < n$, $dp[s] = \\min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])$.\nThe total maximum size $W$ is $dp[\\text{empty string}]$ if we consider an empty string as a prefix of all strings. Or more naturally, $W = dp[0] + dp[1]$ if $n \\ge 1$.\nIf $n=0$, $W = c_{\\text{empty string}}$. But problem states length 1 to $n$.\nSo $W = \\min(c_0, dp[00]+dp[01])$ for $n=2$, etc.\n$W = \\min(c_{\\text{root}}, \\sum_{s \\text{ of length 1}} dp[s])$.\nThis means $W$ is calculated recursively from length $n$ up to length 1.\nFor any string $s$ of length $L$, $dp[s]$ is the maximum number of full-length strings starting with $s$ that can be chosen.\n$dp[s] = c_s$ if $L=n$.\n$dp[s] = \\min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])$ if $L < n$.\nThe final answer is $dp[\\text{root}]$, where root represents the empty string.\nThe total number of strings $s$ is $2^1 + 2^2 + \\dots + 2^n = 2(2^n-1)$.\nFor $n=15$, this is $2(2^{15}-1) \\approx 65534$.\n\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for all strings $s$ of length $L$ to $n$ *under a specific string $p$ of length $L-1$* such that $dp[p]$ will evaluate to $val$.\nThis DP state is for a single subtree.\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L$ to $n$ that are descendants of some fixed string $p$ of length $L-1$, such that the maximum total count for $p$ (i.e., $dp[p]$) is $val$.\nThis is a standard DP on a tree. We calculate $dp[L][\\text{value}]$ for a single node at depth $L$.\nLet $N=n$.\n$dp[L][v]$: number of ways to choose $c_s$ for strings of length $L, \\dots, N$ in a subtree rooted at depth $L-1$ (i.e., for a string of length $L-1$), such that the value for this root is $v$.\nBase case: $L=N$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $N$: $dp[N][v]$ means $c_s=v$. There is 1 way.\nSo $dp[N][v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$.\nFor $L < N$: We want to compute $dp[L][v]$. This corresponds to a string $p$ of length $L-1$.\n$dp[p] = \\min(c_p, dp[p0] + dp[p1])$.\n$c_p$ can be any value from $0$ to $k$.\n$dp[p0]$ can be any value $v_0$ from $0$ to $k \\cdot 2^{N-L}$.\n$dp[p1]$ can be any value $v_1$ from $0$ to $k \\cdot 2^{N-L}$.\nThe maximum possible value for $dp[s]$ at depth $L$ is $k \\cdot 2^{N-L}$.\nSo for $L=N-1$, $dp[N-1][v]$ is the number of ways to pick $c_{s0}, c_{s1}, c_s$ such that $\\min(c_s, c_{s0}+c_{s1}) = v$.\n$dp[L][v]$: number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L \\dots n$ in a subtree, such that the maximum size for the root of this subtree is $v$.\nThis means we need to compute $dp[L][v]$ for strings of length $L$.\nLet $g[L][v]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all descendants of a string $s$ of length $L$, such that $dp[s]$ evaluates to $v$.\nThe maximum value $v$ can take is $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\n$g[n][v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le k$. (Here $dp[s]=c_s$)\nFor $L < n$:\nTo compute $g[L][v]$, we need to choose $c_s$ (for the current string $s$) and $g[L+1][v_0]$ and $g[L+1][v_1]$ for its children $s0$ and $s1$.\n$dp[s] = \\min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])$.\nLet $S = dp[s0] + dp[s1]$.\nWe need to sum over all possible $v_0, v_1$ for $dp[s0], dp[s1]$:\n$g[L][v] = \\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\sum_{v_0=0}^{k \\cdot 2^{n-(L+1)}} \\sum_{v_1=0}^{k \\cdot 2^{n-(L+1)}} \\mathbb{I}(\\min(c_s, v_0+v_1) = v) \\cdot g[L+1][v_0] \\cdot g[L+1][v_1]$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is 1 if the condition is true, 0 otherwise.\nThis is $g[L][v] = \\sum_{v_0, v_1} g[L+1][v_0] \\cdot g[L+1][v_1] \\cdot (\\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\mathbb{I}(\\min(c_s, v_0+v_1) = v))$.\nLet $S = v_0+v_1$.\nThe inner sum $\\sum_{c_s=0}^k \\mathbb{I}(\\min(c_s, S) = v)$ is:\n- If $v < S$: $c_s$ must be $v$. So 1 way (if $v \\le k$).\n- If $v = S$: $c_s$ can be any value from $S$ to $k$. So $k-S+1$ ways (if $S \\le k$).\n- If $v > S$: 0 ways.\nSo, if $v < S$: count is $1$ if $v \\le k$, else $0$.\nIf $v = S$: count is $k-S+1$ if $S \\le k$, else $0$.\nIf $v > S$: count is $0$.\nCombining these:\nIf $v < S$ and $v \\le k$: count is 1.\nIf $v = S$ and $S \\le k$: count is $k-S+1$.\nOtherwise: count is 0.\n\nLet $P[L+1][S] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=S} g[L+1][v_0] \\cdot g[L+1][v_1]$. This is a convolution.\n$g[L][v] = \\left( \\sum_{S=v+1}^{2 \\cdot k \\cdot 2^{n-(L+1)}} P[L+1][S] \\right) \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(v \\le k) + P[L+1][v] \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(v \\le k) \\cdot (k-v+1)$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{S=v+1}^{\\dots} P[L+1][S]$ can be computed efficiently using suffix sums.\nLet $SuffP[L+1][v] = \\sum_{S=v}^{2 \\cdot k \\cdot 2^{n-(L+1)}} P[L+1][S]$.\nThen $\\sum_{S=v+1}^{\\dots} P[L+1][S] = SuffP[L+1][v+1]$.\nSo, $g[L][v] = (SuffP[L+1][v+1] \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(v \\le k) + P[L+1][v] \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(v \\le k) \\cdot (k-v+1)) \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThe maximum value for $S$ is $2 \\cdot k \\cdot 2^{n-(L+1)} = k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nThe maximum value for $v$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nThe maximum possible value for $v$ (and $S$) is $k \\cdot 2^n$.\nFor $n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $k \\cdot 2^n = 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 2^{15} = 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 32768 \\approx 6.5 \\cdot 10^9$. This is too large for DP states.\n\nThe problem asks for $f$ as the maximum size. The maximum value for $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThis means $dp[s]$ values can only go up to $f$.\nSo $v$ ranges from $0$ to $f$.\n$g[n][v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le \\min(k, f)$.\nFor $L < n$:\n$P[L+1][S] = \\sum_{v_0+v_1=S, v_0, v_1 \\le f} g[L+1][v_0] \\cdot g[L+1][v_1]$.\nThe maximum value for $S$ is $2f$.\n$g[L][v]$ for $0 \\le v \\le f$.\n$g[L][v] = (SuffP[L+1][v+1] \\pmod M \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(v \\le k) + P[L+1][v] \\pmod M \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(v \\le k) \\cdot (k-v+1) \\pmod M) \\pmod M$.\nAll $P[L+1][v]$ and $SuffP[L+1][v+1]$ terms must be $\\pmod M$.\n\nThe total number of levels is $n$.\nAt each level $L$ from $n-1$ down to $0$:\n1. Compute $P[L+1][S]$ using convolution of $g[L+1]$ with itself.\n   This can be done using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) for $O(f \\log f)$ time.\n   Or, since $f$ is not too large ($2 \\cdot 10^5$), $O(f^2)$ might be too slow for $n$ levels.\n   $n \\cdot f \\log f$ is feasible. $15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$.\n2. Compute $SuffP[L+1]$ from $P[L+1]$. This is $O(f)$.\n3. Compute $g[L][v]$ for $0 \\le v \\le f$. This is $O(f)$.\n\nThe final answer is $g[0][f]$. (The \"root\" node is at depth 0, meaning length 0, which is the empty string. $dp[\\text{empty string}]$ is the total max size).\nThe problem statement says strings of length 1 to $n$.\nSo the root of our tree is not the empty string, but the two strings \"0\" and \"1\".\nThe overall maximum size $W = dp[0] + dp[1]$.\nSo we need $g[1][v_0]$ for $dp[0]$ and $g[1][v_1]$ for $dp[1]$.\nThe final answer is $\\sum_{v_0+v_1=f} g[1][v_0] \\cdot g[1][v_1]$.\nThis is $P[1][f]$.\n\nLet $dp\\_vals[L]$ be the array $g[L][v]$ for $0 \\le v \\le f$.\n$dp\\_vals[n]$ is an array of size $f+1$, where $dp\\_vals[n][v] = 1$ for $0 \\le v \\le \\min(k, f)$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\nROOT_OF_UNITY = 3 # Primitive root for 998244353\n\ndef ntt(a, inverse):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        w_n = pow(ROOT_OF_UNITY, (MOD - 1) // (len_half * 2), MOD)\n        if inverse:\n            w_n = pow(w_n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, len_half * 2):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_n) % MOD\n        len_half *= 2\n\n    if inverse:\n        n_inv = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n\n    return a\n\ndef multiply_poly(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    n_fft = 1\n    while n_fft < result_len:\n        n_fft <<= 1\n    \n    a_padded = list(a) + [0] * (n_fft - len_a)\n    b_padded = list(b) + [0] * (n_fft - len_b)\n    \n    fa = ntt(a_padded, False)\n    fb = ntt(b_padded, False)\n    \n    for i in range(n_fft):\n        fa[i] = (fa[i] * fb[i]) % MOD\n    \n    result = ntt(fa, True)\n    return result[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # dp_vals[L] will store the polynomial for g[L][v]\n    # g[L][v] is number of ways to choose c_s for descendants of a string s of length L,\n    # such that dp[s] evaluates to v.\n    # Max value for v is f.
