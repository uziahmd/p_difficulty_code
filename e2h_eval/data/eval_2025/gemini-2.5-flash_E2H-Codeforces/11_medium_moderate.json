A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's the game plan for solving this \"Soft Drinking\" problem.**\n\nFirst, the input is a single line with some numbers: `n` (friends), `k` (drink bottles), `l` (ml/bottle), `c` (limes), `d` (slices/lime), `p` (salt), `nl` (ml/toast), and `np` (salt/toast). The goal? Figure out the *maximum* number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring everyone has the same amount.\n\nThe crucial insight is that we have to calculate the maximum toasts for each *individual* friend for each resource and then take the minimum of these values to get the overall answer.\n\nFor each resource (drink, limes, salt), let's calculate:\n\n1.  **Total Resource Units:** Multiply the resource's quantity with available units. For example, for drink: total ml = `k * l`. Then, for limes: total slices = `c * d`, etc.\n2.  **Individual Portions:** Divide total resource by what each toast needs from that resource. For drink, calculate `(k * l) // nl`, for salt, calculate `p // np`. We're using integer division (`//`) because you can't have fractional toasts!\n3.  **Toasts Per Friend:** Finally, divide this individual portion quantity of resource by `n`. For example: `(k * l) // nl // n`.\n\nAnd finally, to give the *maximum* toasts per friend:\nThe limiting factor, the lowest resource capacity, will decide the answer. Calculate the minimum value among these three calculated values to give the final output. The `min()` function will come in handy here.\n\n**Implementation details:**\n\nWe'll use a Python script because it's clean and fast. We can get the input, unpack it, and then do the necessary calculations to derive the number of toasts for each friend based on each resource. To make our code clean, we will parse the integers from the input using `map` and `split()`. Integer division (`//`) will be crucial for calculating the number of whole toasts!\n\nThat should do the trick! Now let's code!",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the maximum number of toasts each of `n` friends can make, given a set of resources: soft drink, limes, and salt. Each friend needs a specific amount of each resource for one toast. All friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\nLet's break down the available resources and the requirements for a single toast per friend:\n\n**Input Variables:**\n*   `n`: Number of friends.\n*   `k`: Number of drink bottles.\n*   `l`: Milliliters of drink per bottle.\n*   `c`: Number of limes.\n*   `d`: Slices per lime.\n*   `p`: Grams of salt available.\n*   `nl`: Milliliters of drink needed per friend per toast.\n*   `np`: Grams of salt needed per friend per toast.\n\n**Calculations for each resource:**\n\n1.  **Soft Drink:**\n    *   Total milliliters of drink available: `k * l`\n    *   Each friend needs `nl` milliliters per toast.\n    *   The total number of \"individual drink portions\" (enough for one friend's one toast) available is `(k * l) // nl`. We use integer division `//` because we can only make whole portions.\n\n2.  **Limes:**\n    *   Total lime slices available: `c * d`\n    *   Each friend needs 1 slice per toast (as per the problem statement: \"a slice of lime\").\n    *   The total number of \"individual lime portions\" available is `c * d`.\n\n3.  **Salt:**\n    *   Total grams of salt available: `p`\n    *   Each friend needs `np` grams per toast.\n    *   The total number of \"individual salt portions\" available is `p // np`. We use integer division.\n\n**Determining Toasts Per Friend:**\n\nAfter calculating the total individual portions available for each resource, we need to consider that these portions must be distributed among `n` friends, and each friend makes the same number of toasts.\n\n*   Toasts per friend based on drink: `(total_drink_portions) // n`\n*   Toasts per friend based on limes: `(total_lime_portions) // n`\n*   Toasts per friend based on salt: `(total_salt_portions) // n`\n\nFinally, the total number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the scarcest resource. Therefore, we take the minimum of these three values.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1`\n\n1.  **Drink:**\n    *   Total drink: `4 * 5 = 20` ml\n    *   Individual drink portions: `20 // 3 = 6`\n    *   Toasts per friend from drink: `6 // 3 = 2`\n\n2.  **Limes:**\n    *   Total lime slices: `10 * 8 = 80`\n    *   Individual lime portions: `80`\n    *   Toasts per friend from limes: `80 // 3 = 26`\n\n3.  **Salt:**\n    *   Total salt: `100` grams\n    *   Individual salt portions: `100 // 1 = 100`\n    *   Toasts per friend from salt: `100 // 3 = 33`\n\n4.  **Result:** `min(2, 26, 33) = 2`\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the input line and parse the integers.\n    # The input consists of 8 space-separated positive integers:\n    # n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Calculate the total number of individual \"portions\" available for each resource.\n    # An \"individual portion\" is enough for one friend to make one toast.\n\n    # 1.
