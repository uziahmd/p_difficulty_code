Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa.

    "thought": "**Understanding Lexicographically Smallest Strings with Swaps**\n\nI'm tackling a problem where I need to rearrange a string to be the lexicographically smallest possible, but with very specific swap rules: I can swap '0' and '1', and also '1' and '2'. The tricky part is that '0' and '2' *can't* swap.  This creates a \"fixed\" order between '0's and '2's, while '1's are super flexible.\n\nMy main insight is that '1's are essentially \"free agents\". They can move past any '0' or '2', making them independent of the relative positions of '0's and '2's.  I can group all the '1's together, and the placement of this group will determine the final smallest string.\n\nTo solve this, I'm thinking of the original string as two parts: a fixed sequence of '0's and '2's, which I'll call `s_02`, and a bunch of '1's that I can insert wherever it's best to achieve the smallest order. So, `s_02` has the relative order of '0' and '2' preserved. '1's can freely move around in this sequence.\n\nTo make the string lexicographically small, I want to arrange it like this: all the '0's, then the '1's, then the '2's. But remember, the '0's and '2's are locked in their relative positions. Any '0' that appears *before* a '2' in `s_02` must also come before that '2' in the final string. I also count all the '1's (as `count1`).\n\nTherefore, the approach is to:\n1.  Extract all the '0's and '2's from the original string into `s_02`, preserving their original order.\n2.  Find the first '2' in this `s_02` string. Any '0's which occur before that '2' go at the start of the final string. All '1's go in next, and the rest of the '0's and '2's follow.\n3. If there are no '2's, simply move all '1's after '0's and output the results.\n\nThis approach gives the lexicographically smallest possible string!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by repeatedly swapping adjacent '0' and '1' characters, or adjacent '1' and '2' characters. We cannot swap '0' and '2' characters.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' <-> '1': A '0' can move past a '1', and vice versa.\n2. '1' <-> '2': A '1' can move past a '2', and vice versa.\n\nThe crucial observation is what cannot swap: '0' and '2'. This means that the relative order of '0's and '2's in the string is fixed. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must appear before that '2' in any string reachable by the allowed operations. The same applies if a '2' appears before a '0'.\n\nHowever, '1's are special. A '1' can swap with a '0', and a '1' can swap with a '2'. This implies that a '1' can effectively move past any '0' or '2' character. This means all '1's in the string can be grouped together into a contiguous block, and this block of '1's can be placed anywhere relative to the '0's and '2's, without affecting the relative order of the '0's and '2's among themselves.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nLet's formalize the strategy:\n1. **Separate '1's from '0's and '2's**: Iterate through the input string `s`. Collect all '0's and '2's into a new sequence (let's call it `s_02`), preserving their relative order. Count the total number of '1's encountered, let this be `count1`.\n\n   Example: `s = \"100210\"`\n   `s_02` becomes `[\"0\", \"0\", \"2\", \"0\"]` (which is `\"0020\"` as a string).\n   `count1` becomes `2`.\n\n2. **Determine placement of '1's**: Since '1's can move freely past '0's and '2's, all `count1` '1's can form a single block `'1' * count1`. To minimize the string lexicographically, this block of '1's should be placed after as many '0's as possible, but before any '2's if possible.\n\n3. **Construct the result**:\n   - Consider the string `s_02` (which contains only '0's and '2's in their fixed relative order).\n   - Find the first occurrence of a '2' in `s_02`. Let its index be `idx_first_2`.\n   - **Case 1: No '2's in `s_02`** (i.e., `idx_first_2` is -1).\n     This means `s_02` consists entirely of '0's. The original string `s` therefore only contains '0's and '1's. Since '0's and '1's can swap, we can move all '0's to the beginning, followed by all '1's.\n     The resulting string is `s_02 + ('1' * count1)`.\n   - **Case 2: '2's exist in `s_02`** (i.e., `idx_first_2` is not -1).\n     All '0's in `s_02` that appear *before* the first '2' can be moved to the very beginning of the final string. Let this part be `s_02[0:idx_first_2]`.\n     After these initial '0's, we want to place '1's to keep the string lexicographically small. All `count1` '1's can be placed here.\n     The remaining part of `s_02`, starting from the first '2' (`s_02[idx_first_2:]`), must maintain its internal relative order and appears after the block of '1's.\n     The resulting string is `s_02[0:idx_first_2] + ('1' * count1) + s_02[idx_first_2:]`.\n\nThis strategy ensures that we place all '0's that are not \"blocked\" by a preceding '2' as early as possible, then all '1's, and then the rest of the '0's and '2's in their fixed relative order. This is the lexicographically smallest arrangement.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `s = \"100210\"`**\n1. Initialize `s_02_chars = []`, `count1 = 0`.\n2. Iterate `s`:\n   - `'1'`: `count1 = 1`\n   - `'0'`: `s_02_chars.append('0')` -> `['0']`\n   - `'0'`: `s_02_chars.append('0')` -> `['0', '0']`\n   - `'2'`: `s_02_chars.append('2')` -> `['0', '0', '2']`\n   - `'1'`: `count1 = 2`\n   - `'0'`: `s_02_chars.append('0')` -> `['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n3. `s_02_str = \"\".join(s_02_chars)` which is `\"0020\"`.\n4. `idx_first_2 = s_02_str.find('2')` which is `2`.\n5. Since `idx_first_2` is not -1:\n   - `prefix_0s = s_02_str[0:2]` which is `\"00\"`.\n   - `middle_1s = '1' * count1` which is `\"11\"`.\n   - `suffix_02s = s_02_str[2:]` which is `\"20\"`.\n6. Result: `\"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\"` = `\"001120\"`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Time: O(N) for iterating through the string, building `s_02_chars`, joining it, finding the first '2', and concatenating parts. N is the length of the string.\n- Space: O(N) for storing `s_02_chars` and the resulting string.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    s_02_chars = []\n    count1 = 0\n\n    # Separate '0's and '2's from '1's\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count1 += 1\n        else: # char is '0' or '2'\n            s_02_chars.append(char)\n    \n    # Convert the list of '0's and '2's to a string for easier manipulation\n    s_02_str = \"\".join(s_02_chars)\n\n    # Find the index of the first '2' in s_02_str\n    idx_first_2 = s_02_str.find('2')\n    \n    result_parts = []\n    if idx_first_2 == -1:\n        # Case 1: No '2's in s_02_str.
