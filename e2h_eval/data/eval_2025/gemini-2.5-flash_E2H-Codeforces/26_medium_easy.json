Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My thinking process for solving the \"Count Triangles\" problem.**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to tackle this \"Count Triangles\" problem. My first step is to really understand the core of it. We're given four integers, `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, and we need to figure out how many non-degenerate triangles we can make where the side lengths `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within certain ranges: `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `C <= z <= D`.  The key, of course, is the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.\n\nThe constraints also tell me `A <= B <= C <= D`, and they’re all fairly large, up to 500,000.  This means a brute-force approach, checking every possible combination of `x`, `y`, and `z` would be too slow. I need something more clever.\n\nSince we know `x <= y <= z` (because of their ranges), I can simplify the triangle inequalities. The conditions `y + z > x` and `x + z > y` are always true with these bounds, so the critical inequality is `x + y > z`. This is the only one I really need to check.\n\nNow, let's break this down. For fixed values of `x` and `y`, I need to find how many values of `z` are valid, meaning `C <= z <= D` *and* `x + y > z`. This means `z` has to be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.  The number of these `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe crucial insight is to avoid nested loops where the time complexity explodes. Instead of iterating `x` and `y` separately, let's look at `x + y`.  Let's call `x + y` as `k`. I see that `k` varies from `A + B` to `B + C`. For each sum `k`, I want to find the number of ways to form `x` and `y` such that `x + y = k`, `A <= x <= B`, and `B <= y <= C`.\n\nLet's say `f(k)` is the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = k` with the given constraints. To get `f(k)`, I can rearrange `x + y = k` to `y = k - x` and substitute that into the range constraints. We’re going to get an expression for `x` that must fall between `max(A, k - C)` and `min(B, k - B)`. If these ranges overlap, we get `f(k)`, otherwise it’s zero. So `f(k)` is `max(0, min(B, k - B) - max(A, k - C) + 1)`.\n\nNow, if `count_z(k)` represents the possible range of `z` for a value of `k`, that means that `C <= z < k` since `z` is in `[C,D]` but must be smaller than `x+y=k`. Which gives us `max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nNow the core of the optimized algorithm: iterate through `k` from `A + B` to `B + C`, calculate `f(k)` (number of valid `x` and `y`) and `count_z(k)` (valid `z` counts), and multiply them! Finally, add the results for all `k` values. That will give us the total number of non-degenerate triangles. The loop has a length of `C - A + 1`, meaning the overall time complexity is linear in terms of the number ranges, `O(D)`.\n\nLet’s check the edge cases: if any of the ranges `f(k)` or `count_z(k)` go negative, they are corrected by `max(0, ...)` and will contribute `0` to the count.\n\nThis method looks correct, is efficient, and accounts for edge cases. I'm ready to write the code. I will test it with a few examples.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, and `z` that satisfy the conditions `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the triangle inequality conditions. For a triangle with sides `x`, `y`, `z` to be non-degenerate, it must satisfy:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we know that `x <= y <= z`. Let's check the inequalities with this ordering:\n*   `y + z > x`: Since `y >= x` and `z >= 1` (as `D >= C >= B >= A >= 1`), `y + z >= x + 1 > x`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n*   `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= 1`, `x + z >= x + y > y`. This inequality is also always satisfied.\n*   `x + y > z`: This is the only non-trivial inequality that needs to be explicitly checked.\n\nSo, the problem simplifies to finding the number of integer triples `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1.  `A <= x <= B`\n2.  `B <= y <= C`\n3.  `C <= z <= D`\n4.  `x + y > z` (or equivalently, `z <= x + y - 1`)\n\nA naive approach of iterating `x`, `y`, and `z` would be `O(B*C*D)` in the worst case, which is too slow given `D` can be up to `5 * 10^5`.\n\nWe can optimize this by iterating over `x` and `y`, and for each pair, calculate the number of valid `z` values. However, iterating `x` from `A` to `B` and `y` from `B` to `C` still results in `O((B-A)(C-B))` complexity, which can be `O(D^2)` in the worst case (`(5*10^5)^2`), still too slow.\n\nA more efficient approach involves iterating over the sum `k = x + y`.\nLet's fix a value `k` for `x + y`.\nFor a given `k`, we need to:\n1.  Count the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = k`, `A <= x <= B`, and `B <= y <= C`.\n2.  Count the number of `z` values such that `C <= z <= D` and `z < k` (i.e., `z <= k - 1`).\n\nLet's denote the count of `(x, y)` pairs for a fixed `k` as `f(k)`.\nThe constraints on `x` are `A <= x <= B`.\nSince `y = k - x`, the constraints on `y` become `B <= k - x <= C`. This implies `k - C <= x <= k - B`.\nCombining these, `x` must satisfy `max(A, k - C) <= x <= min(B, k - B)`.\nThe number of such `x` values (and thus `(x, y)` pairs) is `f(k) = max(0, min(B, k - B) - max(A, k - C) + 1)`.\n\nLet's denote the count of `z` values for a fixed `k` as `count_z(k)`.\nThe constraints on `z` are `C <= z <= D` and `z <= k - 1`.\nCombining these, `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= min(D, k - 1)`.\nThe number of such `z` values is `count_z(k) = max(0, min(D, k - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe total number of triangles is the sum of `f(k) * count_z(k)` over all possible values of `k`.\nThe minimum possible value for `k = x + y` is `A + B` (when `x=A, y=B`).\nThe maximum possible value for `k = x + y` is `B + C` (when `x=B, y=C`).\nSo, `k` ranges from `A + B` to `B + C`.\n\nThe total algorithm is:\n1. Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n2. Iterate `k` from `A + B` to `B + C` (inclusive).\n3. For each `k`:\n    a. Calculate `min_x_for_k = max(A, k - C)`.\n    b. Calculate `max_x_for_k = min(B, k - B)`.\n    c. Calculate `count_xy_for_k = max(0, max_x_for_k - min_x_for_k + 1)`.\n    d. If `count_xy_for_k` is 0, continue to the next `k` (no `(x,y)` pairs for this sum).\n    e. Calculate `z_upper_bound = min(D, k - 1)`.\n    f. Calculate `count_z_for_k = max(0, z_upper_bound - C + 1)`.\n    g. Add `count_xy_for_k * count_z_for_k` to `total_triangles`.\n4. Print `total_triangles`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   The loop for `k` runs from `A + B` to `B + C`. The number of iterations is `(B + C) - (A + B) + 1 = C - A + 1`.\n*   In the worst case, `A=1` and `C=5 * 10^5`, so the loop runs approximately `5 * 10^5` times.\n*   Inside the loop, all calculations are `O(1)`.\n*   Therefore, the total time complexity is `O(C - A)`, which is `O(D)` in the worst case (since `C <= D`). This is efficient enough for `D = 5 * 10^5`.\n*   The maximum value of `total_triangles` can be large (up to `(5*10^5)^3` roughly, but more accurately `(C-A) * (B-A) * (D-C)` roughly `5e5 * 5e5 * 5e5 = 1.25e17`), so Python's arbitrary-precision integers are suitable.\n\nThis approach correctly handles all constraints and edge cases, including when ranges for `x`, `y`, or `z` become empty due to `max(0, ...)` operations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read A, B, C, D from standard input\n    # The problem statement implies a single test case per run,\n    # but the example shows multiple lines of input.\n    # We'll read line by line until EOF to handle multiple test cases if present.\n    \n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            break # End of input\n\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.split())\n\n        total_triangles = 0\n\n        # Iterate over possible sums k = x + y\n        # x ranges from A to B\n        # y ranges from B to C\n        # Therefore, k = x + y ranges from (min x + min y) to (max x + max y)\n        # i.e., from A + B to B + C.\n        \n        # Iterate k from A+B to B+C (inclusive)\n        for k in range(A + B, B + C + 1):\n            # Step 1: Calculate f(k) - the number of pairs (x, y) such that x + y = k\n            # and A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C.\n            #\n            # From y = k - x, substitute into B <= y <= C:\n            # B <= k - x <= C\n            # This implies:\n            # k - x >= B  =>  x <= k - B\n            # k - x <= C  =>  x >= k - C\n            # So, k - C <= x <= k - B.\n            #\n            # Combining with A <= x <= B:\n            # x must satisfy max(A, k - C) <= x <= min(B, k - B).\n            \n            min_x_for_k = max(A, k - C)\n            max_x_for_k = min(B, k - B)\n            \n            # The number of valid x values for this k is max_x_for_k - min_x_for_k + 1.\n            # If min_x_for_k > max_x_for_k, the range is empty, so count is 0.\n            count_xy_for_k = max(0, max_x_for_k - min_x_for_k + 1)\n            \n            # If there are no (x,y) pairs for this sum k, then no triangles can be formed.\n            if count_xy_for_k == 0:\n                continue\n\n            # Step 2: Calculate count_z(k) - the number of z values such that C <= z <= D and z < k.\n            # (The condition z < k comes from the triangle inequality x + y > z, i.e., k > z).\n            # This means z must satisfy C <= z <= min(D, k - 1).\n            \n            z_upper_bound = min(D, k - 1)\n            \n            # The number of valid z values for this k is z_upper_bound - C + 1.\n            # If z_upper_bound < C, the range is empty, so count is 0.\n            count_z_for_k = max(0, z_upper_bound - C + 1)\n            \n            # Add the product of counts to the total.\n            total_triangles += count_xy_for_k * count_z_for_k\n            \n        print(total_triangles)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the logic\nsolve()\n\n```",
