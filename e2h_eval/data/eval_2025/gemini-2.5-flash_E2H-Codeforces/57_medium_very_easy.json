His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this competitive programming problem and what I need to do.**  The goal is to write a Python script that calculates the best and worst possible ranks for a participant named Vasya in an Olympiad. We're given two lists of scores, `a` and `b`, representing the scores from two different tours, but importantly, we *don't* know which score belongs to which participant.  Vasya's total score must be at least `x`.\n\n**First, the Best Rank:** My initial thought is to maximize Vasya's score, making him as high-scoring as possible. The intuition is that if he gets the highest total score, he's guaranteed to be at least tied for first, which the problem allows the jury to break. However, since the scores are mixed, the best score would be the `max(a) + max(b)`. If that were possible, he'd be in first. But is that possible with all other participant scores?\n\nThinking this over, it turns out the best rank is always 1. Since the scores are *separated* into tours without individual names, only one person can achieve the very maximum of the combined results. No matter how the scores are paired, no one can get higher than the maximum values of each tour. So, Vasya gets to choose from `n` results from each tour. And since a single person would be the highest, it's a first-place guarantee. Therefore, the strategy is always to try to get `max(a) + max(b)`. Since no other person can match this score, Vasya will be first.\n\n**Now, the Worst Rank:** This is where things get interesting. I need to minimize Vasya's score *while still meeting the `x` condition* and, at the same time, maximize the number of other participants who score greater than or equal to his score.  It's a delicate balance. I have to create pairs from `a` and `b`, such that, from among them, Vasya will have as many scores above him as possible.\n\nThe core idea for the worst rank becomes to sort the scores. Sorting both `a` and `b` in ascending order, then pairing Vasya with the appropriate scores, then creating `n-1` pairs from the remaining elements is important. To maximize the scores of others, the worst-case scenario will result in all `a[i]` be paired with `b[n-1-i]`.\nThe logic is: Find Vasya's *minimum valid score* (>= x) from among all possible pairings. Then, create the optimal pairings for everyone else such that the `S_V` result from Vasya gets the most scores above it.\n\nMy first thought was that this might require iterating through all possible valid score combinations for Vasya, but that would be too slow (O(N^2) or worse). I got to the idea of an efficient method. I need to find all possible values of `a_i + b_j` >= `x`, in pairs, then count how many of these scores are greater. The pairing strategy for `S_k` values creates `n` potential scores.\n\nThen it clicked: to calculate the *worst* rank efficiently, sort `a` and `b` in ascending order. Then calculate all of the sums `S_i = a[i] + b[n-1-i]` to make `n` sums of sorted data in a \"worst case.\" Then, find the smallest sum `S_V_worst` that's at least `x`. Finally, the worst rank is just the number of sums that are at least `S_V_worst`. So, sort sums, find the right one, and take its position.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad. We are given `n` scores for the first tour (`a`) and `n` scores for the second tour (`b`), but we don't know which participant scored what. We only know that Vasya is one of the `n` participants and his total score is at least `x`. Each participant's total score is the sum of their scores from tour 1 and tour 2, and each score from `a` and `b` must be used exactly once to form `n` pairs. Ranks are assigned based on total scores, with higher scores getting better ranks. If participants have the same total score, the jury can assign places as they choose.\n\nLet's analyze the best and worst rank scenarios.\n\n**Best Rank Scenario**\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank (rank 1), Vasya needs to maximize his own score and ensure that no other participant can achieve a strictly higher score.\nThe highest possible score any single participant can achieve is `max(a) + max(b)`.\nLet `max_a` be the highest score in list `a`, and `max_b` be the highest score in list `b`.\nVasya can be assigned `max_a` from tour 1 and `max_b` from tour 2, resulting in a total score of `max_a + max_b`. The problem guarantees that there exists a pair `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`, so `max_a + max_b` will always be a valid score for Vasya (and if `max_a + max_b < x`, then no one can satisfy the condition, which contradicts the guarantee).\nSince `max_a` and `max_b` are unique (in the sense that once used, they are no longer available as the highest scores), no other participant can achieve `max_a + max_b`. All other participants will necessarily have scores less than or equal to `max_a + max_b`.\nGiven the jury's discretion for ties, if Vasya is the sole participant with `max_a + max_b`, he gets rank 1. If other participants also somehow get `max_a + max_b` (which is impossible if `max_a` and `max_b` are truly unique maximal elements), Vasya can still be placed first among them.\nTherefore, Vasya's best possible rank is always **1**.\n\n**Worst Rank Scenario**\n\nTo achieve the worst possible rank, Vasya wants to:\n1.  Minimize his own score `S_V`, subject to `S_V >= x`.\n2.  Maximize the number of other participants whose scores are greater than or equal to `S_V`.\n\nThis means we need to find a specific pairing of `a` scores with `b` scores for all `n` participants, such that Vasya's score `S_V` meets the `S_V >= x` condition, and the total count of participants (including Vasya) whose scores are `>= S_V` is maximized.\n\nConsider the following pairing strategy:\n1.  Sort list `a` in ascending order: `a_0 <= a_1 <= ... <= a_{n-1}`.\n2.  Sort list `b` in ascending order: `b_0 <= b_1 <= ... <= b_{n-1}`.\n3.  Form `n` pairs by taking `a_i` and `b_{n-1-i}` for `i = 0, ..., n-1`. That is, pair the smallest score from `a` with the largest score from `b`, the second smallest from `a` with the second largest from `b`, and so on.\n\nLet the sums of these pairs be `C = [a_0 + b_{n-1}, a_1 + b_{n-2}, ..., a_{n-1} + b_0]`.\nThis pairing strategy is known to minimize the maximum sum among all possible pairings, and also to minimize the sum of all scores. Intuitively, this strategy tries to balance out the scores, making them as \"close\" as possible, which often results in a scenario where many participants might have similar scores, leading to a higher rank for Vasya if he's among them.\n\nLet's sort the `C` list in ascending order.\nNow, we look for the smallest score `S_V` in `C` such that `S_V >= x`. This `S_V` represents the lowest score Vasya could possibly get while meeting the minimum score requirement, *under this specific pairing strategy*.\nSince the jury can assign places arbitrarily for ties, if Vasya gets `S_V`, and `k` other people also get scores `>= S_V` from this specific pairing, then Vasya's rank would be `k+1`. This is simply the count of elements in `C` that are `>= S_V`.\n\nLet's prove why this strategy gives the worst rank.\nSuppose there is another pairing `P'` that gives Vasya a worse rank. This means under `P'`, Vasya gets a score `S_V'` (where `S_V' >= x`), and there are `k'` participants with scores `>= S_V'`, where `k'` is greater than the count we found with our strategy.\nIf we consider any set of `n` pairs `(a_p, b_q)` that make up the final scores, and Vasya is assigned one of them, say `(a_k, b_l)` with sum `S_V = a_k + b_l`. We want to maximize the number of pairs `(a_p, b_q)` (from the chosen `n` pairs) such that `a_p + b_q >= S_V`.\nThe pairing `a_i + b_{n-1-i}` (after sorting `a` and `b` ascending) generates a sequence of sums. If we pick the smallest `S_V` from these sums that is `>= x`, say `S_V = a_k + b_{n-1-k}`, then all other sums `a_j + b_{n-1-j}` for `j < k` are less than `S_V`, and all sums for `j >= k` are `>= S_V`. Thus, `n-k` participants have scores `>= S_V`. This specific pairing minimizes the scores, and thus, for a given threshold `x`, it tends to make more scores fall above or at a lower threshold, resulting in a higher rank.\n\n**Algorithm for Worst Rank:**\n1.  Read `n` and `x`.\n2.  Read list `a` and sort it in ascending order.\n3.  Read list `b` and sort it in ascending order.\n4.  Initialize `worst_rank = n`.\n5.  Use two pointers: `ptr_a` starting at `0` (smallest `a`) and `ptr_b` starting at `n-1` (largest `b`).\n6.  Iterate `ptr_a` from `0` to `n-1`:\n    *   While `ptr_b >= 0` and `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x`:\n        *   This means `a[ptr_a]` paired with `b[ptr_b]` (the largest available `b` for `a[ptr_a]`) is still less than `x`. So, `b[ptr_b]` cannot be paired with `a[ptr_a]` or any smaller `a` to reach `x`. We must use `b[ptr_b]` for another participant, moving `ptr_b` down.\n        *   Decrement `ptr_b`.\n    *   If `ptr_b < 0`, it means even the largest `b` combined with `a[ptr_a]` (or larger `a` values previously checked) cannot reach `x`. This should not happen due to the problem guarantee that Vasya was present and `a_i + b_j >= x` exists.\n    *   The number of participants who can score at least `x` using this pairing strategy, if `a[ptr_a]` is used by Vasya, is `ptr_a + (ptr_b + 1)`. Specifically, the number of remaining elements in `a` is `n - ptr_a`. The number of remaining elements in `b` is `ptr_b + 1`. The number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` where `a_i` is from `a[ptr_a:]` and `b_j` from `b[:ptr_b+1]` such that `a_i + b_j >= x` is what we need.\n    *   The count of pairs `(a_i, b_{n-1-i})` such that `a_i + b_{n-1-i} >= x` is `n - k`, where `k` is the first index such that `a_k + b_{n-1-k} >= x`. This is effectively the number of participants whose scores are `a_k + b_{n-1-k}` or higher.\n    *   A simpler way to count: Iterate `ptr_a` from `0` to `n-1`. For each `a[ptr_a]`, we need to find a `b[ptr_b]` such that `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x`. We want to maximize the count of such pairs.\n    *   This is exactly the two-pointer approach for `count_ge(S)` discussed in thought process:\n        `a` sorted ascending, `b` sorted ascending.\n        `count = 0`\n        `i = 0` (pointer for `a`)\n        `j = n-1` (pointer for `b`)\n        While `i < n` and `j >= 0`:\n            If `a[i] + b[j] >= x`:\n                `count++`\n                `i++`\n                `j--`\n            Else:\n                `i++`\n        This `count` is the maximum number of participants who can achieve a score of at least `x` in *some* pairing. This is the worst rank Vasya could get.\n\nLet's re-verify the example:\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]` -> sorted `a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]` -> sorted `b = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\nTwo pointers `i` for `a`, `j` for `b` (from right):\n`i=0, j=5`: `a[0]+b[5] = 3+8 = 11`. `11 >= 7`. `count=1`. `i=1, j=4`.\n`i=1, j=4`: `a[1]+b[4] = 4+6 = 10`. `10 >= 7`. `count=2`. `i=2, j=3`.\n`i=2, j=3`: `a[2]+b[3] = 4+4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `count=3`. `i=3, j=2`.\n`i=3, j=2`: `a[3]+b[2] = 4+4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `count=4`. `i=4, j=1`.\n`i=4, j=1`: `a[4]+b[1] = 5+3 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `count=5`. `i=5, j=0`.\n`i=5, j=0`: `a[5]+b[0] = 6+0 = 6`. `6 < 7`. `i=6`.\nLoop ends because `i=6`.\nThe `count` is 5. So, the worst rank is 5.\nThis matches the example output.\n\nThis two-pointer approach correctly finds the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` that can be formed such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. If Vasya is one of these participants, and the jury places him last among them, this is his worst rank.\n\nFinal Answer:\nBest Rank: 1\nWorst Rank: calculated using the two-pointer strategy described above.\n\nComplexity:\nSorting `a` and `b`: `O(N log N)`.\nTwo-pointer scan: `O(N)`.\nTotal time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\nSpace complexity: `O(N)` for storing lists.\n`N=10^5` is perfectly fine for `O(N log N)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best Rank: Vasya can always achieve rank 1.\n    # He can take the highest score from list 'a' and the highest score from list 'b'.\n    # For example, if max(a) is a_k and max(b) is b_l, Vasya gets a_k + b_l.\n    # No other participant can get a score strictly greater than this.\n    # Since the jury can assign places arbitrarily for ties, Vasya can be placed first.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst Rank:\n    # To find the worst rank, we want to maximize the number of participants\n    # (including Vasya) who score at least 'x'.\n    # If 'k' participants score >= x, and Vasya is one of them, his worst rank is 'k'.\n    # We can find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n    # This can be done using a two-pointer approach after sorting both lists.\n\n    a.sort()  # Sort in ascending order\n    b.sort()  # Sort in ascending order\n\n    count_ge_x = 0\n    ptr_a = 0  # Pointer for list 'a', starting from the smallest element\n    ptr_b = n - 1 # Pointer for list 'b', starting from the largest element\n\n    while ptr_a < n and ptr_b >= 0:\n        if a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x:\n            # We found a pair that sums up to at least 'x'.\n            # We use the smallest available 'a' and largest available 'b' to satisfy the condition.\n            # This maximizes the chance for remaining elements to also satisfy the condition.\n            count_ge_x += 1\n            ptr_a += 1\n            ptr_b -= 1\n        else:\n            # a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x.\n            # Since 'b' is sorted ascending, b[ptr_b] is the largest available 'b' score.\n            # If even the largest 'b' score cannot help a[ptr_a] reach 'x',\n            # then a[ptr_a] cannot be paired with any remaining 'b' to reach 'x'.\n            # So, we discard a[ptr_a] and try the next smallest 'a' score.\n            ptr_a += 1\n            \n    worst_rank = count_ge_x\n\n    print(best_rank, worst_rank)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
