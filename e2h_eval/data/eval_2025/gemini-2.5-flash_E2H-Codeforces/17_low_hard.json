He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for Prefixes and Suffixes**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to tackle this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem. Let's break down my thinking. The core is figuring out which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string `s`.  We're given `2n-2` strings, all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`.\n\nInitially, I'm noting the obvious: there are two strings of each length, and we need to determine if they're prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S'). My mind immediately goes to the structure of prefixes and suffixes. Prefixes start at the beginning of the string, suffixes at the end.  Length is crucial; it's the key to mapping these shorter strings back to the original `s`.\n\nI'm thinking about how the prefixes and suffixes relate to the length `n` of the original string. The longest prefix and suffix are of length `n-1`. This is my primary tool for reconstructing the string `s`. Since the prefix of length `n-1` is `s[0:n-1]` and the suffix of length `n-1` is `s[1:n]`, that's how I can nail this down.\n\nThe critical insight is how to reconstruct the full string `s`. The final char of the length `n-1` prefix is the last char of `s`, and the first char of the length `n-1` suffix is the first char of `s`. If I can identify the longest prefix and suffix, I should be able to reconstruct the string, and, from there, classify the remaining shorter strings. This sounds like the optimal approach. I need to be careful with indexing – there's likely an off-by-one error lurking in there somewhere. Also, I must ensure that `s = P_n-1 + s[n-1]` (where `P_{n-1}` is the prefix of length `n-1`), and that `s = s[0] + S_{n-1}` (where `S_{n-1}` is the suffix of length `n-1`).\n\nNow, I'm confident in starting to translate this thought process into Python code. The core logic should involve identifying the longest prefix and suffix, using them to determine the full string, and then iterating through the input to classify each string as 'P' or 'S'.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify `2n-2` given strings as either prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that there are exactly two strings of each length from `1` to `n-1`, and these are indeed the prefixes and suffixes of some valid string `s`.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1.  **Identify Candidate `s`:**\n    *   There are two strings of length `n-1` among the input. Let's call them `str1` and `str2`.\n    *   One of these must be the prefix of length `n-1` (`s[0:n-1]`) and the other must be the suffix of length `n-1` (`s[1:n]`).\n    *   This gives us two possibilities for the original string `s`:\n        *   **Possibility 1:** `str1` is `s[0:n-1]` and `str2` is `s[1:n]`. In this case, `s` would be `str1[0]` + `str2` (if `str1[1:] == str2[:-1]`). More simply, `s = str1 + str2[-1]`.\n        *   **Possibility 2:** `str2` is `s[0:n-1]` and `str1` is `s[1:n]`. In this case, `s` would be `str2 + str1[-1]`.\n    *   We need to check if these candidate `s` strings are valid. A candidate `s` is valid if:\n        1.  Its prefix of length `n-1` matches the assigned `P_{n-1}`.\n        2.  Its suffix of length `n-1` matches the assigned `S_{n-1}`.\n        3.  All other prefixes `s[0:k]` for `1 \\le k < n-1` and suffixes `s[n-k:n]` for `1 \\le k < n-1` are present in the input list.\n\n2.  **Verify Candidate `s`:**\n    *   Let's take **Possibility 1**: `P_{n-1} = str1` and `S_{n-1} = str2`.\n        *   The full string `s` would be `str1[0] + str2` (if `str1[1:] == str2[:-1]`). Or `str1 + str2[-1]`.\n        *   The condition for this assignment to be valid is that `str1` (the prefix of length `n-1`) must match `str2` (the suffix of length `n-1`) on their overlapping part. That is, `str1[1:]` must be equal to `str2[:-1]`. If this condition holds, then `s = str1[0] + str2`.\n        *   Once we have a candidate `s` (let's call it `candidate_s`), we generate all its prefixes (`candidate_s[0:k]`) and suffixes (`candidate_s[n-k:n]`) for `1 \\le k < n`.\n        *   We then check if the set of these generated prefixes and suffixes exactly matches the set of input strings. If it does, `candidate_s` is a valid original string.\n\n3.  **Determine the Output:**\n    *   Since the problem guarantees that *some* existing string `s` is consistent, at least one of the two possibilities for `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}` will lead to a valid `s`.\n    *   Once we find a valid `candidate_s` (let's say it was formed by assuming `str1` was `P_{n-1}` and `str2` was `S_{n-1}`), we can iterate through the original input strings.\n    *   For each input string `inp_str` at index `i`:\n        *   If `inp_str` is `candidate_s[0:len(inp_str)]` (i.e., it's a prefix of `candidate_s`), we mark it as 'P'.\n        *   Otherwise, it must be a suffix, so we mark it as 'S'.\n    *   We need to be careful with duplicates. If an input string appears multiple times, and it could be both a prefix and a suffix of `candidate_s`, we need a way to assign them.\n    *   A simpler approach for assigning 'P'/'S' after finding `candidate_s`:\n        1.  Create a list of all prefixes of `candidate_s` (lengths 1 to `n-1`).\n        2.  Iterate through the original input strings. For each `input_string`:\n            *   If `input_string` is in the `prefixes_list` and we haven't already assigned it as a prefix (to handle duplicates), assign 'P' and remove it from `prefixes_list`.\n            *   Otherwise, assign 'S'.\n\nLet's refine the assignment logic to handle duplicates correctly.\n\n**Refined Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Store the original input strings in a list, say `input_strings_ordered`.\n3.  Group input strings by length. For each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, there will be two strings. Store them, e.g., in a dictionary `strings_by_len[k] = [str_a, str_b]`.\n4.  Identify the two strings of length `n-1`. Let them be `s_n_minus_1_a` and `s_n_minus_1_b`.\n\n5.  **Attempt 1: Assume `s_n_minus_1_a` is `P_{n-1}` and `s_n_minus_1_b` is `S_{n-1}`.**\n    *   Check if `s_n_minus_1_a[1:] == s_n_minus_1_b[:-1]`. This ensures the overlap is consistent.\n    *   If consistent, form `candidate_s1 = s_n_minus_1_a[0] + s_n_minus_1_b`.\n    *   Verify `candidate_s1`:\n        *   Generate all expected prefixes: `P_k = candidate_s1[0:k]` for `k=1...n-1`.\n        *   Generate all expected suffixes: `S_k = candidate_s1[n-k:n]` for `k=1...n-1`.\n        *   Create a multiset (or frequency map) of all `P_k` and `S_k`.\n        *   Create a multiset of the `input_strings_ordered`.\n        *   If these two multisets are identical, then `candidate_s1` is a valid string. Proceed to step 7.\n\n6.  **Attempt 2: Assume `s_n_minus_1_b` is `P_{n-1}` and `s_n_minus_1_a` is `S_{n-1}`.**\n    *   Check if `s_n_minus_1_b[1:] == s_n_minus_1_a[:-1]`.\n    *   If consistent, form `candidate_s2 = s_n_minus_1_b[0] + s_n_minus_1_a`.\n    *   Verify `candidate_s2` using the multiset comparison as in step 5.\n    *   If `candidate_s2` is valid, proceed to step 7.\n\n7.  **Construct the Output String:**\n    *   We have found a valid `candidate_s` (either `candidate_s1` or `candidate_s2`).\n    *   Initialize an empty list `result_chars` of length `2n-2`.\n    *   Create a frequency map `prefix_counts` for all prefixes of `candidate_s` (lengths 1 to `n-1`). `prefix_counts[p]` stores how many times prefix `p` can be assigned.\n    *   Iterate through `input_strings_ordered` with index `i` and string `s_in`:\n        *   If `s_in` is a prefix of `candidate_s` (i.e., `s_in == candidate_s[0:len(s_in)]`) AND `prefix_counts[s_in] > 0`:\n            *   Set `result_chars[i] = 'P'`.\n            *   Decrement `prefix_counts[s_in]`.\n        *   Else:\n            *   Set `result_chars[i] = 'S'`.\n    *   Join `result_chars` to form the final output string.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n = 5`\nInput: `ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba`\n`input_strings_ordered = ['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']`\n\nStrings by length:\nLength 1: `a`, `a`\nLength 2: `ba`, `ab`\nLength 3: `aba`, `aba`\nLength 4: `abab`, `baba`\n\nStrings of length `n-1 = 4`: `s_n_minus_1_a = \"abab\"`, `s_n_minus_1_b = \"baba\"`\n\n**Attempt 1:** `P_4 = \"abab\"`, `S_4 = \"baba\"`\n*   Check overlap: `P_4[1:] = \"bab\"`, `S_4[:-1] = \"bab\"`.

But `prefix_counts['a']` is 0. So this 'a' must be a suffix. `result_chars[3] = 'S'`.\n5. `s_in = 'aba'` (index 4): Is prefix `ababa[0:3]`. `prefix_counts['aba']` is 1. `result_chars[4] = 'P'`. `prefix_counts['aba']` becomes 0.\n6. `s_in = 'baba'` (index 5): Not a prefix of \"ababa\". `result_chars[5] = 'S'`.\n7. `s_in = 'ab'` (index 6): Is prefix `ababa[0:2]`. `prefix_counts['ab']` is 1. `result_chars[6] = 'P'`. `prefix_counts['ab']` becomes 0.\n8. `s_in = 'aba'` (index 7): Is prefix `ababa[0:3]`. But `prefix_counts['aba']` is 0. So this 'aba' must be a suffix. `result_chars[7] = 'S'`.\n\nResult: `SPPSPSPS`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis approach seems robust for handling duplicates by using a frequency map for prefixes and only assigning 'P' if a prefix slot is available.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    input_strings_ordered = []\n    strings_by_len = [[] for _ in range(n)] # strings_by_len[k] stores strings of length k\n    \n    for _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        input_strings_ordered.append(s)\n        strings_by_len[len(s)].append(s)\n\n    # Get the two strings of length n-1\n    s_n_minus_1_a, s_n_minus_1_b = strings_by_len[n-1]\n\n    candidate_s = \"\"\n    \n    # Try possibility 1: s_n_minus_1_a is P_{n-1}, s_n_minus_1_b is S_{n-1}\n    # s = P_{n-1}[0] + S_{n-1}\n    # For this to be valid, P_{n-1}[1:] must be equal to S_{n-1}[:-1]\n    if s_n_minus_1_a[1:] == s_n_minus_1_b[:-1]:\n        temp_s = s_n_minus_1_a[0] + s_n_minus_1_b\n        \n        # Verify if temp_s is consistent\n        expected_strings = []\n        for k in range(1, n):\n            expected_strings.append(temp_s[0:k]) # Prefix of length k\n            expected_strings.append(temp_s[n-k:n]) # Suffix of length k\n        \n        if Counter(expected_strings) == Counter(input_strings_ordered):\n            candidate_s = temp_s\n\n    # If candidate_s is not found yet, try possibility 2: s_n_minus_1_b is P_{n-1}, s_n_minus_1_a is S_{n-1}\n    if not candidate_s:\n        # s = P_{n-1}[0] + S_{n-1}\n        # For this to be valid, P_{n-1}[1:] must be equal to S_{n-1}[:-1]\n        if s_n_minus_1_b[1:] == s_n_minus_1_a[:-1]:\n            temp_s = s_n_minus_1_b[0] + s_n_minus_1_a\n            \n            # Verify if temp_s is consistent\n            expected_strings = []\n            for k in range(1, n):\n                expected_strings.append(temp_s[0:k]) # Prefix of length k\n                expected_strings.append(temp_s[n-k:n]) # Suffix of length k\n            \n            if Counter(expected_strings) == Counter(input_strings_ordered):\n                candidate_s = temp_s\n    \n    # Now candidate_s holds the correct string (guaranteed by problem statement)\n    \n    # Generate the result string\n    result_chars = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n    \n    # Count how many of each prefix we can assign\n    # There is exactly one prefix of each length 1 to n-1\n    prefix_slots = Counter()\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        prefix_slots[candidate_s[0:k]] += 1\n\n    for i, s_in in enumerate(input_strings_ordered):\n        # Check if s_in is a prefix of candidate_s AND we still have a slot for it\n        if s_in == candidate_s[0:len(s_in)] and prefix_slots[s_in] > 0:\n            result_chars[i] = 'P'\n            prefix_slots[s_in] -= 1\n        else:\n            result_chars[i] = 'S'\n            \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_chars) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
