And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Sleep Time Averaging Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this sleep time averaging problem, and here's my thought process. The core is to efficiently calculate the average sleep time across various \"weeks,\" where a \"week\" is defined as a consecutive set of 'k' days. I've got 'n' total days and the sleep data for each day in a list 'a'.\n\nMy first thought is to understand the core calculations. I need the total number of 'k'-day weeks, which is simply `n - k + 1`.  Then, for each week, I sum up the sleep times of the 'k' consecutive days, and finally, average these weekly sums.\n\nI see that a straightforward \"brute force\" approach (calculating the sum for each week independently) would be computationally expensive, especially with large 'n' and 'k' values. My analysis quickly showed that an `O(n*k)` time complexity would not be efficient enough to meet the given time constraint.\n\nNow, my mind jumps to optimization techniques.  I can definitely leverage prefix sums to streamline the calculations. If I precompute prefix sums (the cumulative sum up to each day), I can calculate the sum of sleep times for any week in constant time (O(1)) by taking the difference of two prefix sums. Building the prefix sum array will cost O(n) time, and then summing up each week becomes O(n-k+1), which gives a total complexity of O(n), which is efficient.\n\nI'm thinking I'll create a `prefix_sum` array of size `n+1`, where `prefix_sum[i]` represents the sum of `a[0]` up to `a[i-1]`. With this, the sum for the week starting on day `i` can be calculated with `prefix_sum[i+k] - prefix_sum[i]`. I am confident that the prefix sum will be the most efficient solution for this, and I can then take all of the totals and divide by the number of weeks. This prefix sum strategy provides the needed performance to handle the constraints.\n",
