The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Gilded Cells**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate, and I'm given the width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`). My initial thoughts are that I need to break this down. The core concept is that each ring represents the border of a smaller inner rectangle. So, let's call the plate's dimensions *width* and *height* because that's more intuitive to me.\n\nI need to iterate through each of the `k` rings. For each ring `i`, I first need to calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle.  The problem states that the inner rectangle dimensions are `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. This is key: the inner rectangle's dimensions shrink by 4 for each ring (2 cells from each side).\n\nNow, the trick is determining the number of border cells for a given rectangle size, and I need to be careful with the edge cases. I know the general formula for the perimeter is `2W + 2H - 4`, where `W` and `H` are the width and height of the rectangle, but that doesn't hold true when `W` or `H` is 1.\n\nSo, here's my plan:\n*   I'll calculate the `current_w` and `current_h` for each ring using the formula `current_w = w - 4(i - 1)` and `current_h = h - 4(i - 1)`.\n*   Then, I'll determine the number of border cells for the current ring. If either `current_w` or `current_h` is 1, the number of cells is `current_w * current_h`. Otherwise, I'll use the perimeter calculation of  `2*current_w + 2*current_h - 4`. I'll have to add this to a running total.\n*   I'll sum up the number of cells in each ring, handling the edge cases, to get the total number of gilded cells.\n",
