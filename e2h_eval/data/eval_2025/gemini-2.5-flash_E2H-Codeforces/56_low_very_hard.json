Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Guard Duty Problem with Python**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem and I need to come up with a Python solution. The first thing I'm doing is a thorough problem analysis.  I have `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases to match up.  The key is that each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base, and vice-versa, meaning `R` and `B` have to be equal. If they're not, that's an immediate \"No\" and I can move on. Let's assume `R = B = N`.\n\nNow, the hard part is the non-intersection constraint: any two paths from base to spaceship *must not* cross.  The problem says \"do not intersect in the galaxy plane,\" so I'm thinking strict non-intersection. The coordinates are nice and small integers, up to 10000, and `R` and `B` are also small (1 to 10). The problem even throws me a bone with the statement \"no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line\" to simplify things geometrically.\n\nSo, *R=B* and no intersections. My initial thoughts are that if the numbers are not equal it is impossible to solve, and that is a simple check to begin with. The meat of the issue is figuring out the matching where there are no intersections.\n\nMy geometric intuition is kicking in here. If I can think of a way to order the points that somehow prevents those crossings, I might be onto something. Think about the simple case of points on a line. If the spaceship and base points are ordered in the same way, then connecting them will never cause an intersection. I feel like this concept has to hold up in 2D. I need to figure out what that \"ordering\" is in 2D space.\n\nThinking geometrically, a convex hull keeps coming to mind, since the perimeter points can be connected. If all of the points are on the edges of the convex hull, and the matching goes in the same direction, that should work. So, If I have two segments R_a B_x and R_b B_y, these intersect if the order of points is not preserved. I am going to have to make this work somehow.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a perfect matching between `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases such that no two connecting segments (paths) intersect.\n\nFirst, a perfect matching requires that the number of Rebel spaceships `R` must be equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, it's impossible to satisfy the condition \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", so we output \"No\".\n\nIf `R = B = N`, we need to find a permutation `p` of `(0, 1, ..., N-1)` such that the segments `(Rebel[i], Base[p[i]])` for `i = 0, ..., N-1` are pairwise non-intersecting.\n\nThe small constraint `N <= 10` suggests that we can try all possible permutations. There are `N!` permutations. For `N=10`, `10! = 3,628,800`, which is a feasible number of permutations to check.\n\nFor each permutation `p`:\n1. Form the `N` segments: `S_i = (Rebel[i], Base[p[i]])`.\n2. Check if any two segments `S_i` and `S_j` (where `i != j`) intersect. If we find any intersecting pair, this permutation is invalid.\n3. If all pairs of segments are non-intersecting, then we have found a valid assignment, and we can output \"Yes\" and terminate.\n\nIf we iterate through all `N!` permutations and none of them lead to a valid assignment, then we output \"No\".\n\n**Geometric Intersection Check:**\nTo check if two line segments `(P1, P2)` and `(Q1, Q2)` intersect, we can use the concept of orientation (cross product).\nGiven three points `A`, `B`, `C`, the orientation of `(A, B, C)` can be:\n*   `0`: Collinear\n*   `> 0`: Clockwise\n*   `< 0`: Counter-clockwise\n\nThe cross product `(B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - A.x)` gives us this orientation value.\n\nTwo segments `(P1, P2)` and `(Q1, Q2)` intersect if and only if:\n1.  The orientation of `(P1, P2, Q1)` is different from the orientation of `(P1, P2, Q2)`.\n2.  The orientation of `(Q1, Q2, P1)` is different from the orientation of `(Q1, Q2, P2)`.\n\nThis condition covers the general case where segments properly cross.\nThe problem guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\" and \"no two points coincide\". This simplifies the checks, as we don't need to worry about collinear points or segments touching at endpoints (which are not considered intersections in this context, as per typical competitive programming interpretations of \"do not intersect\" for segments). The problem states \"do not intersect in the galaxy plane\", which usually implies strict crossing.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Read `R` and `B`.\n2. Read `R` spaceship coordinates into a list `rebels`.\n3. Read `B` base coordinates into a list `bases`.\n4. If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n5. Initialize a flag `found_solution = False`.\n6. Iterate through all permutations `p` of `(0, 1, ..., N-1)` (where `N=R=B`).\n   a. Assume `current_permutation_valid = True`.\n   b. For `i` from `0` to `N-2`:\n      i. For `j` from `i+1` to `N-1`:\n         1. Let `seg1 = (rebels[i], bases[p[i]])`.\n         2. Let `seg2 = (rebels[j], bases[p[j]])`.\n         3. Check if `seg1` and `seg2` intersect using the orientation check.\n         4. If they intersect, set `current_permutation_valid = False` and break from both inner loops (go to the next permutation).\n   c. If `current_permutation_valid` is still `True` after checking all pairs, then we found a valid assignment. Print \"Yes\", set `found_solution = True`, and break from the permutation loop.\n7. If `found_solution` is `False` after checking all permutations, print \"No\".\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough (Conceptual):**\nR = [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\nB = [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\nN = 3\n\nConsider the permutation `p = [0, 1, 2]` (connect R0-B0, R1-B1, R2-B2):\nSegments:\nS0: ((0,0), (-2,1))\nS1: ((2,0), (0,3))\nS2: ((3,1), (2,2))\n\nCheck S0 and S1:\nP1=(0,0), P2=(-2,1)\nQ1=(2,0), Q2=(0,3)\nOrientations:\n(P1, P2, Q1) = ((0,0), (-2,1), (2,0)) -> cross_product(-2,1,2,0) = (-2)*0 - 1*2 = -2 (CCW)\n(P1, P2, Q2) = ((0,0), (-2,1), (0,3)) -> cross_product(-2,1,0,3) = (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6 (CCW)\n(Q1, Q2, P1) = ((2,0), (0,3), (0,0)) -> cross_product(-2,3,-2,0) = (-2)*0 - 3*(-2) = 6 (CW)\n(Q1, Q2, P2) = ((2,0), (0,3), (-2,1)) -> cross_product(-2,3,-4,1) = (-2)*1 - 3*(-4) = -2 + 12 = 10 (CCW)\n\n(P1,P2,Q1) and (P1,P2,Q2) have same orientation (-2, -6).\n(Q1,Q2,P1) and (Q1,Q2,P2) have different orientations (6, 10).\nWait, this is incorrect logic. The condition is `(o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4)`. My cross product logic for orientation `(A,B,C)` should be `(B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - A.x)`.\nLet's recheck:\n`orient(P, Q, R)`: `(Q[0]-P[0])*(R[1]-P[1]) - (Q[1]-P[1])*(R[0]-P[0])`\n\nS0: P1=(0,0), P2=(-2,1)\nS1: Q1=(2,0), Q2=(0,3)\n\no1 = orient(P1, P2, Q1) = orient((0,0), (-2,1), (2,0)) = (-2-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) = -2*0 - 1*2 = -2\no2 = orient(P1, P2, Q2) = orient((0,0), (-2,1), (0,3)) = (-2-0)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(0-0) = -2*3 - 1*0 = -6\n`o1` and `o2` are both negative, so `o1*o2 > 0`. This means Q1 and Q2 are on the same side of P1P2.\n\no3 = orient(Q1, Q2, P1) = orient((2,0), (0,3), (0,0)) = (0-2)*(0-0) - (3-0)*(0-2) = -2*0 - 3*(-2) = 6\no4 = orient(Q1, Q2, P2) = orient((2,0), (0,3), (-2,1)) = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(-2-2) = -2*1 - 3*(-4) = -2 + 12 = 10\n`o3` and `o4` are both positive, so `o3*o4 > 0`. This means P1 and P2 are on the same side of Q1Q2.\n\nSince `o1*o2 > 0` and `o3*o4 > 0`, the segments S0 and S1 do not intersect. This is correct. The example output is \"Yes\", and the note says \"one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order\", which implies this permutation is valid. We would continue checking S0-S2 and S1-S2, and if no intersections, output \"Yes\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\n# Helper function to calculate orientation\n# Returns:\n# > 0 if (p, q, r) is clockwise\n# < 0 if (p, q, r) is counter-clockwise\n# = 0 if (p, q, r) are collinear\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - \\\n          (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])\n    return val\n\n# Function to check if two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect\n# This function assumes no three points are collinear (guaranteed by problem)\n# and no two points coincide (guaranteed by problem).\n# It checks for proper intersection (crossing).\ndef do_segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if orientations differ for both segments\n    # o1 and o2 must have different signs (p2, q2 on opposite sides of p1q1)\n    # o3 and o4 must have different signs (p1, q1 on opposite sides of p2q2)\n    # Since no three points are collinear, orientation values will never be 0.\n    if (o1 > 0 and o2 < 0) or (o1 < 0 and o2 > 0):\n        if (o3 > 0 and o4 < 0) or (o3 < 0 and o4 > 0):\n            return True\n    \n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        rebels.append(list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        bases.append(list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    if R != B:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"No\\n\")\n        return\n\n    N = R\n    \n    # Iterate through all permutations of base indices\n    # Each permutation `p` means rebel[i] is connected to bases[p[i]]\n    for p_indices in itertools.permutations(range(N)):\n        is_current_permutation_valid = True\n        \n        # Check all unique pairs of segments\n        # A segment connects rebels[i] to bases[p_indices[i]]\n        # A second segment connects rebels[j] to bases[p_indices[j]]\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(i + 1, N): # j starts from i+1 to check unique pairs\n                # Segment 1: (rebels[i], bases[p_indices[i]])\n                p1 = rebels[i]\n                q1 = bases[p_indices[i]]\n\n                # Segment 2: (rebels[j], bases[p_indices[j]])\n                p2 = rebels[j]\n                q2 = bases[p_indices[j]]\n\n                if do_segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n                    is_current_permutation_valid = False\n                    break # Found an intersection, this permutation is invalid\n            if not is_current_permutation_valid:\n                break # Break from outer loop if inner loop found invalidity\n        \n        if is_current_permutation_valid:\n            sys.stdout.write(\"Yes\\n\")\n            return # Found a valid permutation, no need to check further\n\n    # If no permutation was found to be valid after checking all\n    sys.stdout.write(\"No\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
