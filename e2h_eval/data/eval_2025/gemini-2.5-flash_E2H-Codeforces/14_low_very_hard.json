He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a classic competitive programming problem: given an integer `m`, I need to find all positive integers `n` where `n!` has *exactly* `m` trailing zeroes. The output should be the count of such `n` values, followed by the values themselves in ascending order.\n\nMy initial thought is to dive into how trailing zeroes are created. I know from past experience (and a quick refresher) that trailing zeroes come from factors of 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, and the number of factors of 2 is always more than or equal to the number of factors of 5 in a factorial, the problem boils down to counting the number of factors of 5 in `n!`.\n\nLegendre's formula comes to mind immediately. I'll use it:  `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` This effectively captures the total count of factors of 5.  This sum continues as long as powers of 5 are less than or equal to n.\n\nNow, let's analyze how `Z(n)` behaves. It's a non-decreasing function; it either stays the same or increases. It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5. I realize there's a pattern here. For instance, `Z(n)` remains constant across a range of values until we hit a multiple of 5. It *jumps* at multiples of 5, and it jumps even further at multiples of 25, 125, and so on, due to the additional factors of 5 they contribute.\n\nTake `m = 1` for example: I can see that `Z(5) = 1`. Then, `Z(6) = Z(7) = Z(8) = Z(9) = 1` as well. That gives me 5 valid answers in this case.\n\nHere's the key insight: If I find an `n_0` such that `Z(n_0) = m`, then the integers `n_0` to `n_0 + 4` will all have exactly `m` trailing zeroes as long as `n_0` to `n_0 + 4` are not multiples of 5, which would cause the count to increase. In the other case `Z(n)` will remain the same for the next `k` values.\n\nThis means I can devise an iterative approach. I'll start with a low value of `n` and compute `Z(n)`. I'll keep increasing `n` and calculating `Z(n)` until I find an `n` where `Z(n) = m`. This will give me a starting point. Then, I can check if the count increases when `n` is a multiple of 5. If it doesn't, the answer is the 5 numbers in that range. I can then use that knowledge to efficiently generate the solution set. I need to make sure to handle edge cases, such as when no such values exist.  Now, time to translate this logic into Python!\n",
