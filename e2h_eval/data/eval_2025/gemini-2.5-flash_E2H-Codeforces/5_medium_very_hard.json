Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Colored Boots\" Problem: A Deep Dive into Greedy Matching**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this \"Colored Boots\" problem. The goal is to maximize compatible left-right boot pairs. Initially, I was thinking bipartite matching, but the large input size (up to 150,000) makes standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp too slow. We need something clever.\n\nThe first step is to categorize the boots by color. We can use lists to store the indices of left and right boots for each color (a-z) and also for the wildcard character '?'. My gut feeling is that a greedy approach will work here, and it's time to figure out the right priority.\n\nIt's clear that exact color matches are the most restrictive; if a boot of color 'c' can match another 'c', we should do it immediately. Matching a 'c' with a '?' is less ideal, as that '?' could have been used for something else. Following this logic, our priority should be: (c, c), then (c, '?') or ('?', c), and finally ('?', '?').\n\nSo, the plan is to follow this greedy strategy. First, we'll try to match all boots with exact color matches. We'll iterate through each specific color and pair as many as possible. After this, we handle the remaining specific color boots by matching them with available '?' boots. And finally, we will match remaining ? boots with other ? boots.\n\nLet's test this with a simple example.\n```\nn = 7\nl = \"abaca?b\"\nr = \"zabbbcc\"\n```\nAfter initial processing.\n\nThe proposed algorithm has the following steps:\n1. Matching exact pairs.\n2. Matching pairs using the '?'\n3. Matching ? pairs.\n\nI am feeling confident with this approach. We'll use lists to efficiently store indices and pop elements during the matching process. Time complexity is O(N) since we go through the list once. Space is also O(N). Let's implement this and see how it works!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. We are given `n` left boots and `n` right boots, with their colors represented by strings `l` and `r`. Colors can be specific lowercase Latin letters or an indefinite `'?'`. Compatibility rules are:\n1.  Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2.  An indefinite color `'?'` is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The key idea is to prioritize matches that are more restrictive, thus saving the more flexible `'?'` boots for situations where specific-colored boots have fewer options.\n\nWe can categorize matches into three types based on their restrictiveness:\n1.  **Exact specific color matches (`c`, `c`):** Both boots have the same specific color. These are the most restrictive because a specific-colored boot `c` can only match another `c` or a `'?'`. If it matches another `c`, it uses two specific boots and leaves `'?'` boots available.\n2.  **Specific color with indefinite color matches (`c`, `'?'`) or (`'?'`, `c`):** One boot has a specific color, and the other is `'?'`. These are less restrictive than exact matches.\n3.  **Indefinite color with indefinite color matches (`'?'`, `'?'`):** Both boots are `'?'`. These are the least restrictive, as `'?'` can match anything.\n\nThe greedy strategy is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Match all possible exact specific color pairs (`c`, `c`).**\nFor each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z':\nWe match a left boot of color `c` with a right boot of color `c` until we run out of either left `c` boots or right `c` boots. This uses up specific boots that have a perfect match, ensuring that `'?'` boots are not \"wasted\" on matches that could have been made by specific boots.\n\n**Step 2: Match remaining specific color boots with `'?'` boots.**\nAfter Step 1, any specific-colored boot `c` that remains unmatched no longer has a partner of color `c` on the opposite side. Its only remaining option is to match with a `'?'` boot.\nFor each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n*   If there are remaining left boots of color `c`, match them with available right `'?'` boots.\n*   If there are remaining right boots of color `c`, match them with available left `'?'` boots.\nThis step ensures that specific-colored boots, which have limited matching options, are paired up as much as possible using the flexible `'?'` boots.\n\n**Step 3: Match remaining `'?'` boots with `'?'` boots.**\nAfter Step 2, all specific-colored boots are either matched or there are no `'?'` boots of the opposite type available. The only boots left are `left_boots['?']` and `right_boots['?']`. We pair these up until one side runs out.\n\n**Data Structures:**\nTo implement this efficiently, we can use lists to store the 1-based indices of boots for each color. Since there are 26 specific colors ('a'-'z') and one indefinite color ('?'), we can use two arrays of lists, one for left boots and one for right boots, each of size 27. We can map 'a' to index 0, 'b' to 1, ..., 'z' to 25, and '?' to 26.\n\n`left_indices[color_code]` will store a list of 1-based indices of left boots of that color.\n`right_indices[color_code]` will store a list of 1-based indices of right boots of that color.\n\nWhen a boot is matched, its index is removed from its respective list (e.g., using `list.pop()`). This ensures each boot is used at most once.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`n = 7`\n`l = \"abaca?b\"`\n`r = \"zabbbcc\"`\n\n`left_indices`: `'a': [1, 3, 5]`, `'b': [2, 7]`, `'c': [4]`, `'?': [6]`\n`right_indices`: `'z': [1]`, `'a': [2]`, `'b': [3, 4, 5]`, `'c': [6, 7]`\n\n**Step 1: Exact matches (`c`, `c`)**\n*   `c = 'a'`: `left_a = [1, 3, 5]`, `right_a = [2]`. Match `(1, 2)`.\n    `left_a` becomes `[3, 5]`, `right_a` becomes `[]`.\n*   `c = 'b'`: `left_b = [2, 7]`, `right_b = [3, 4, 5]`. Match `(2, 3)` and `(7, 4)`.\n    `left_b` becomes `[]`, `right_b` becomes `[5]`.\n*   `c = 'c'`: `left_c = [4]`, `right_c = [6, 7]`. Match `(4, 6)`.\n    `left_c` becomes `[]`, `right_c` becomes `[7]`.\nCurrent pairs: `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 6)]`. Total 4 pairs.\n\n**Step 2: Specific color with indefinite color matches (`c`, `'?'`) or (`'?'`, `c`)**\n*   `c = 'a'`: `left_a = [3, 5]`, `right_? = []`. No matches.\n*   `c = 'b'`: `right_b = [5]`, `left_? = [6]`. Match `(6, 5)`.\n    `right_b` becomes `[]`, `left_?` becomes `[]`.\n*   `c = 'c'`: `right_c = [7]`, `left_? = []`. No matches.\nCurrent pairs: `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 6), (6, 5)]`. Total 5 pairs.\n\n**Step 3: Indefinite color with indefinite color matches (`'?'`, `'?'`)**\n`left_? = []`, `right_? = []`. No matches.\n\nFinal pairs: 5. The pairs are `(1, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 6), (6, 5)`. This matches the example output (order may vary).\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N) for parsing input and populating the lists. Each boot index is added to a list once and popped from a list at most once across all three steps. Thus, matching operations are also O(N). Total time complexity is O(N).\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store the boot indices in the lists.\n\nGiven `N` up to 150,000, an O(N) solution is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Using lists of lists to store indices for each color.\n    # 'a' -> 0, 'b' -> 1, ..., 'z' -> 25, '?' -> 26\n    left_boots_by_color = [[] for _ in range(27)]\n    right_boots_by_color = [[] for _ in range(27)]\n\n    # Helper to convert char to integer code\n    def char_to_code(char):\n        if char == '?':\n            return 26\n        return ord(char) - ord('a')\n\n    # Populate lists with 1-based indices\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_boots_by_color[char_to_code(l_str[i])].append(i + 1)\n        right_boots_by_color[char_to_code(r_str[i])].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors with the same specific color (c, c)\n    for code in range(26): # 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_boots_by_color[code] and right_boots_by_color[code]:\n            l_idx = left_boots_by_color[code].pop()\n            r_idx = right_boots_by_color[code].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Step 2: Match remaining specific color boots with '?' boots (c, ?) or (?, c)\n    # Match left specific boots with right '?' boots\n    for code in range(26): # 'a' through 'z'\n        while left_boots_by_color[code] and right_boots_by_color[26]: # 26 is '?'\n            l_idx = left_boots_by_color[code].pop()\n            r_idx = right_boots_by_color[26].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Match right specific boots with left '?' boots\n    for code in range(26): # 'a' through 'z'\n        while right_boots_by_color[code] and left_boots_by_color[26]: # 26 is '?'\n            l_idx = left_boots_by_color[26].pop()\n            r_idx = right_boots_by_color[code].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Step 3: Match remaining '?' boots with '?' boots (?, ?)\n    while left_boots_by_color[26] and right_boots_by_color[26]:\n        l_idx = left_boots_by_color[26].pop()\n        r_idx = right_boots_by_color[26].pop()\n        pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Output the result\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for l_idx, r_idx in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
