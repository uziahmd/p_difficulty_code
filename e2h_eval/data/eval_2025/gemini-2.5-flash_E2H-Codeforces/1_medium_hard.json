    "thought": "**Problem Analysis and Solution for Gilded Cells on a Rectangular Plate**\n\nOkay, so I'm given a rectangular plate with width `w` and height `h`.  There are `k` gilded rings on this plate, each with a width of one cell.  The challenge is to figure out the total number of gilded cells. The rings are constructed in a specific way: the `i`-th ring borders an inner rectangle with dimensions `w - 4(i - 1)` by `h - 4(i - 1)`.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the structure of these rings.  The dimensions of each inner rectangle shrink with each ring, and I need a formula to calculate the cells in each ring.  A key observation is that the border cells of a rectangle can be calculated as the perimeter minus 4 (to avoid double-counting the corners).  I express this as `2W + 2H - 4` where `W` and `H` are the dimensions of the rectangle. An equivalent, but perhaps more insightful, formula is `W * H - (W - 2) * (H - 2)`.\n\nThe crucial part here is making sure that the inner rectangles at each level still make sense.  I need to verify that `w - 4(i - 1)` and `h - 4(i - 1)` remain positive enough to have borders. The constraint `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)` is important for this.  I analyze this constraint and deduce that the innermost rectangle for ring `k` will always have dimensions of at least 3x3. This validates the border formula.\n\nI express the dimensions of the i-th rectangle as `W_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `H_i = h - 4(i - 1)`. The number of cells in the `i`-th ring, `C_i`, becomes `2W_i + 2H_i - 4 = 2 * (w - 4*(i - 1)) + 2 * (h - 4*(i - 1)) - 4`. Simplifying, this becomes `2w + 2h - 4 - 16(i - 1)`.\n\nThe final step is to sum up the cells in all `k` rings.  This forms an arithmetic series. The total gilded cells, `S`, is the sum of `C_i` for `i` from 1 to `k`.  This sum simplifies to `k * (2w + 2h + 4 - 8k)`.\n\nI double-check this formula against a couple of examples and verify it. I also revisit the problem definition and ring spacing to be certain everything is correct and logically sound. Finally, I confirm that the calculation has no overflow issues given the constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate of dimensions `w` by `h`. There are `k` gilded rings. The `i`-th ring (1-indexed) is defined as all bordering cells of an inner rectangle of size `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\nLet's break down the structure of the rings:\n\n1.  **Dimensions of the `i`-th inner rectangle**:\n    For the `i`-th ring, the effective width `W_i` and height `H_i` of the rectangle whose border forms the ring are:\n    `W_i = w - 4 * (i - 1)`\n    `H_i = h - 4 * (i - 1)`\n\n2.  **Cells in a single ring**:\n    The number of cells forming the border of a `W x H` rectangle (with a width of 1 cell) can be calculated as `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`. This formula accounts for the perimeter, subtracting 4 because the corner cells are counted twice.\n    This formula is valid as long as `W >= 2` and `H >= 2`.\n    Given the constraints `3 <= w, h <= 100` and `1 <= k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`, we can prove that `W_i` and `H_i` will always be at least 3 for all `i` from 1 to `k`.\n    The smallest dimensions occur for `i = k`. The constraint `4k <= min(w, h) + 1` implies `4(k - 1) <= min(w, h) - 3`.\n    Therefore, `W_k = w - 4(k - 1) >= w - (min(w, h) - 3)`. If `w` is the minimum dimension, `W_k >= w - (w - 3) = 3`. If `h` is the minimum (so `w >= h`), `W_k >= w - (h - 3) >= h - (h - 3) = 3`. Similarly, `H_k >= 3`. Thus, the formula for border cells is always applicable.\n\n    Substituting `W_i` and `H_i` into the border cell formula:\n    `Cells_in_ring_i = 2 * (w - 4 * (i - 1)) + 2 * (h - 4 * (i - 1)) - 4`\n    `Cells_in_ring_i = 2w - 8(i - 1) + 2h - 8(i - 1) - 4`\n    `Cells_in_ring_i = (2w + 2h - 4) - 16(i - 1)`\n\n3.  **Total gilded cells**:\n    The total number of gilded cells is the sum of cells in each of the `k` rings:\n    `Total_gilded_cells = sum_{i=1 to k} Cells_in_ring_i`\n    `Total_gilded_cells = sum_{i=1 to k} ((2w + 2h - 4) - 16(i - 1))`\n\n    This is an arithmetic series. Let `A = (2w + 2h - 4)` and `D = 16`. The sum is `sum_{j=0 to k-1} (A - D*j)`.\n    `Total_gilded_cells = k * A - D * sum_{j=0 to k-1} j`\n    The sum of the first `k-1` non-negative integers is `(k - 1) * k / 2`.\n    `Total_gilded_cells = k * (2w + 2h - 4) - 16 * (k - 1) * k / 2`\n    `Total_gilded_cells = k * (2w + 2h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)`\n    Factor out `k`:\n    `Total_gilded_cells = k * [ (2w + 2h - 4) - 8 * (k - 1) ]`\n    `Total_gilded_cells = k * [ 2w + 2h - 4 - 8k + 8 ]`\n    `Total_gilded_cells = k * (2w + 2h + 4 - 8k)`\n\nThis formula efficiently calculates the total number of gilded cells. The maximum possible value for `Total_gilded_cells` (e.g., `w=100, h=100, k=25`) is `25 * (200 + 200 + 4 - 8*25) = 25 * (404 - 200) = 25 * 204 = 5100`, which fits well within standard integer types.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read w, h, and k from a single line of standard input, space-separated.\n    w, h, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Calculate the total number of gilded cells using the derived formula:\n    # Total_gilded_cells = k * (2w + 2h + 4 - 8k)\n    total_gilded_cells = k * (2 * w + 2 * h + 4 - 8 * k)\n\n    # Print the result to standard output, followed by a newline.\n    sys.stdout.write(str(total_gilded_cells) + '\\n')\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the program.\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
