    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Ternary String Lexicographical Minimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the lexicographically smallest ternary string given these specific swap rules: '01' <-> '10' and '12' <-> '21'. My initial thought is to analyze what these swaps actually *do*.  Essentially, a '0' can 'pass' a '1', and a '1' can 'pass' a '2'.\n\nThe key realization hit me pretty quickly: '0's and '2's *cannot* directly swap.  That's huge! This implies their *relative* order is fixed. If I see a \"0...2\" sequence in the original string, that order has to be preserved in the final result. Same goes for a \"2...0\" sequence.\n\nNow, my strategy starts to form.  I want to get the '0's as far left as possible (since they're the smallest), then the '1's, and finally the '2's.  But those pesky fixed relationships between '0's and '2's are the constraint.\n\nI have to carefully consider the '1's. Initially, I thought that because of the swaps, the '1's were \"free\" to move anywhere, which is not true. A '1' can't move to be between '0' and '2'. Now, I realize that it's all about how the '1's are positioned relative to the '0's and '2's in the original string. It seems like the '1's are completely \"free\" to move past any '0' or '2' to their left or right.\n\nTherefore, the approach becomes clear: I'll preserve the relative order of '0's and '2's, then fill the gaps with the '1's to minimize the string lexicographically. Essentially, I should count all 0s, 1s, and 2s, and place the '0's as far left as they can go (respecting their original relative order with the '2's). Then, place all the '1's, and finally, all the '2's. This is the optimal placement for lexicographical minimization.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0's and '1's, and adjacent '1's and '2's. We cannot swap '0's and '2's directly.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '01' <-> '10'\n2. '12' <-> '21'\n\nNotice that '0's cannot swap with '2's. This is the crucial observation.\nThis means that the relative order of '0's and '2's in the string is invariant. If we have a '0' at index `i` and a '2' at index `j` in the original string, and `i < j`, then this specific '0' will always appear before this specific '2' in any reachable string. Conversely, if `i > j`, the '0' will always appear after the '2'.\n\nThe '1's, however, can swap with both '0's and '2's. This means a '1' can move freely past any '0' or any '2'. Essentially, '1's can be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's.\n\nTo make a string lexicographically smallest, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by '1's, then '2's.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each character:\n- Count of '0's: `count_0`\n- Count of '1's: `count_1`\n- Count of '2's: `count_2`\n\nSince '1's can move freely, they can be collected together and placed anywhere.\nThe '0's and '2's, however, maintain their relative order.\nConsider the sequence of '0's and '2's in the original string, ignoring '1's. For example, if the string is \"100210\", the sequence of '0's and '2's is \"0020\". This relative order must be preserved.\n\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. We want to place all '0's as far left as possible.\n2. Then, we want to place all '1's.\n3. Finally, all '2's.\n\nBecause '0's and '2's cannot swap, a '0' can only move left until it hits another '0' or the beginning of the string. A '2' can only move left until it hits another '2', a '0', or the beginning of the string.\nA '0' can move past any '1' to its left. A '0' can move past any '1' to its right. So all '0's can be grouped together.\nSimilarly, all '2's can be grouped together.\n\nThe key insight is that all '1's can be moved past any '0' or '2'. This means we can effectively remove all '1's from the string, arrange the remaining '0's and '2's to be lexicographically smallest while preserving their relative order, and then insert the '1's back into the optimal position.\n\nWhat is the optimal position for the '1's? To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put '0's first. Since '1's are greater than '0's, we should put all '0's first. Then, after all '0's, we should put all '1's. After all '1's, we put all '2's.\n\nHowever, we must respect the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's.\nLet's iterate through the input string `s`.\nWe will build the result string.\nWe should try to put '0's first.\nThen, if we encounter a '1', where should it go?\nIf we have a '2' in the original string, say `s[k] == '2'`, then any '0' that appears after `s[k]` (i.e., `s[j] == '0'` with `j > k`) cannot move before `s[k]`. This means any '0' that appears *after* the first '2' in the original string cannot move to the very beginning of the string.\nThe '1's can move past any '0' or '2'. This means all '1's can be gathered and inserted at any point in the sequence of '0's and '2's.\n\nTo get the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. All '0's that appear before the *first* '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning.\n2. All '1's can be moved to any position. To minimize lexicographically, they should come after all '0's and before all '2's.\n3. The remaining '0's (those that appeared after the first '2') and all '2's must maintain their relative order.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n1. Collect all '0's that appear before the first '2' in the original string. Append them to the result.\n2. Collect all '1's from the original string. Append them to the result.\n3. Collect all '2's from the original string, and all '0's that appear after the first '2'. Append them to the result, maintaining their original relative order.\n\nLet's trace this logic with an example: `s = \"100210\"`\n- Find the index of the first '2'. It's at index 3 (`s[3] == '2'`).\n- Characters before index 3 are `s[0], s[1], s[2]` which are '1', '0', '0'.\n  - From these, '0's are `s[1], s[2]`. Append \"00\" to result. `res = \"00\"`.\n  - All '1's in the original string: `s[0]` and `s[4]`. There are two '1's. Append \"11\" to result. `res = \"0011\"`.\n- Characters from index 3 onwards are `s[3], s[4], s[5]` which are '2', '1', '0'.\n  - Filter out the '1's (we've already counted and placed them). The remaining are '2', '0'. Append \"20\" to result. `res = \"001120\"`.\nThis matches the example output.\n\nLet's try another example: `s = \"20\"`\n- First '2' is at index 0.\n- Characters before index 0: none. No '0's to append. `res = \"\"`.\n- All '1's in original string: none. No '1's to append. `res = \"\"`.\n- Characters from index 0 onwards: '2', '0'. Filter out '1's (none). Remaining are '2', '0'. Append \"20\". `res = \"20\"`.\nThis matches the example output.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize an empty string or list `result`.\n2. Find the index of the first occurrence of '2' in `s`. Let this be `first_two_idx`. If '2' is not present, `first_two_idx` can be considered `len(s)`.\n3. Iterate through `s` from `i = 0` to `first_two_idx - 1`:\n   If `s[i]` is '0', append '0' to `result`.\n4. Count all '1's in `s`. Append `count_1` number of '1's to `result`.\n5. Iterate through `s` from `i = first_two_idx` to `len(s) - 1`:\n   If `s[i]` is '0' or '2', append `s[i]` to `result`.\n6. Print the `result` string.\n\nThis approach guarantees that:\n- All '0's that *can* move to the left of all '1's and '2's do so. These are the '0's that appear before the first '2'.\n- All '1's are grouped together after these initial '0's. This is optimal because '1' > '0' and '1' < '2'.\n- The remaining '0's (those after the first '2') and all '2's are appended, preserving their relative order. This is necessary because '0's and '2's cannot swap, so their relative order is fixed.\n\nThis algorithm is efficient. It involves a few passes over the string. Finding the first '2' is O(N). Counting '1's is O(N). Building the result string involves iterating through parts of the string, which is also O(N). The total time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the string.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n            \n    # If no '2' is present, all '0's can go first, then all '1's.\n    # The logic below handles this by setting first_two_idx to len(s)\n    # and then the third part of the string construction will be empty.\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        first_two_idx = len(s)\n\n    result_chars = []\n    \n    # Part 1: '0's that appear before the first '2'\n    for i in range(first_two_idx):\n        if s[i] == '0':\n            result_chars.append('0')\n            \n    # Part 2: All '1's\n    count_ones = s.count('1')\n    result_chars.extend(['1'] * count_ones)\n    \n    # Part 3: '0's and '2's that appear from the first '2' onwards\n    for i in range(first_two_idx, len(s)):\n        if s[i] == '0' or s[i] == '2':\n            result_chars.append(s[i])\n            \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_chars) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
