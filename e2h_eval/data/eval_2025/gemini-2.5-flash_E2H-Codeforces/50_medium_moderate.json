    "thought": "**Problem Analysis and Solution for Good Edge-Weighted Trees**\n\nI'm tackling a competitive programming problem where the goal is to find the sum of `d(1, n)` over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. A \"good\" tree is defined as an edge-weighted tree with `n` vertices, where each edge has a weight of either 1 or -1, and for each vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges is -1.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the conditions of a \"good\" tree. I notice that by taking the product of the conditions across all vertices, I can deduce an important constraint: `(-1)^n = 1`, which means `n` must be even. If `n` is odd, there are no valid \"good\" trees, and the answer is 0.\n\nNow, focusing on the even case, I realize the problem is to find a formula for the sum of `d(1, n)` (which is the sum of the weights along the unique path between vertices 1 and `n`) across all such valid trees. My strategy is to analyze how the weight of each edge `w(u,v)` affects the total sum.\n\nA key insight is that for a tree with `n` even, the conditions imposed on edge weights (i.e. having product of incident weights = -1) are not independent. There is exactly one assignment of edge weights that satisfies these constraints. This is a crucial finding that makes the problem solvable.\n\nI then focus on the sum of `d(1,n)` over all possible trees. I determine that if `e` is the edge between `u` and `v`, the contribution of each edge `e` depends on how often this specific edge occurs on the path from `1` to `n`.  I need to compute the number of trees that contain the given edge, and such edge will have a specific weight that depends on the number of vertices in each of the components created upon removal of this particular edge.\nIn other words, the contribution of an edge `e` is determined by the size of the component containing the starting vertex (vertex `u`) after that edge `e` is removed from a tree.\n\nI find a combinatorial formula for calculating this number of trees, leveraging the properties of tree structures and the inclusion-exclusion principle. The final formula involves binomial coefficients, and modular exponentiation.\n\nTherefore, the main difficulty I now face is in efficiently calculating this sum modulo 998244353. To do so, I implement modular arithmetic for efficient combinations calculation, and modular exponentiation to compute powers and combinations. My solution involves precomputing factorials and inverse factorials, and the `pow` function using the modulo to handle large numbers.\n\nAfter carefully checking the correctness of the formula and my implementation through several test cases, I arrive at the final Python code. The code runs with a time complexity of `O(n log P)`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the sum of `d(1,n)` over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo `998244353`. An edge-weighted tree is \"good\" if each edge has weight `1` or `-1`, and for each vertex `i`, the product of weights of all incident edges is `-1`.\n\nLet `w(u,v)` be the weight of the edge `(u,v)`.\nThe condition is `product_{j adj to i} w(i,j) = -1` for all `i=1, \\dots, n`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of a good tree.\nConsider the product of the conditions for all vertices:\n`product_{i=1 to n} (product_{j adj to i} w(i,j)) = product_{i=1 to n} (-1)`\nThe right side is `(-1)^n`.\nOn the left side, each edge `(u,v)` contributes `w(u,v)` to the product for `u` and `w(u,v)` to the product for `v`. So `w(u,v)` appears twice.\nThus, the left side is `product_{(u,v) is an edge} (w(u,v))^2`.\nSince `w(u,v)` is either `1` or `-1`, `(w(u,v))^2 = 1`.\nSo the left side simplifies to `1^(n-1) = 1`.\nThis implies `1 = (-1)^n`.\nThis equation holds only if `n` is an even number.\nIf `n` is odd, `1 = -1`, which is a contradiction. Therefore, if `n` is odd, there are no good trees. In this case, the sum of `d(1,n)` is 0.\n\nNow, assume `n` is even.\nLet's represent edge weights using binary variables: `w(u,v) = (-1)^{b(u,v)}`, where `b(u,v) in {0,1}`.\nThe condition `product_{j adj to i} w(i,j) = -1` becomes `(-1)^{sum_{j adj to i} b(i,j)} = -1`.\nThis is equivalent to `sum_{j adj to i} b(i,j) = 1 (mod 2)` for all `i=1, \\dots, n`.\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations over `GF(2)` with `n-1` variables (one for each edge).\nAs shown above, if `n` is even, one of these equations is redundant (any `n-1` equations imply the `n`-th). The matrix of this system (incidence matrix of the tree) has rank `n-1` for a tree. Thus, for any given tree structure `T`, there is a unique assignment of `b(e)` values (and thus `w(e)` values) that makes `T` a good tree.\n\nOur task is to find `sum_{T good} d_T(1,n)`.\n`d_T(1,n)` is the sum of weights of edges on the unique path `P_T(1,n)` from `1` to `n` in `T`.\n`d_T(1,n) = sum_{e on P_T(1,n)} w_T(e)`.\nThe total sum is `sum_{T good} sum_{e on P_T(1,n)} w_T(e)`.\nWe can swap the summation order: `sum_{e=(x,y) in K_n} sum_{T good: e on P_T(1,n)} w_T(x,y)`.\n\nLet's determine `w_T(e)` for an edge `e=(x,y)` in a tree `T`.\nRemoving `e` splits `T` into two connected components, say `T_x` containing `x` and `T_y` containing `y`. Let `|V_x|` be the number of vertices in `T_x`.\nSumming `sum_{j adj to i} b(i,j) = 1 (mod 2)` over all vertices `i` in `V_x`:\n`sum_{i in V_x} (sum_{j adj to i} b(i,j)) = sum_{i in V_x} 1 (mod 2)`.\nThe right side is `|V_x| (mod 2)`.\nOn the left side, any edge `(u,v)` with both `u,v` in `V_x` contributes `2*b(u,v)` to the sum, which is `0 (mod 2)`. The only edge that connects to a vertex outside `V_x` is `e=(x,y)`. It contributes `b(x,y)` to `sum_{j adj to x} b(x,j)`.\nSo, `b(x,y) = |V_x| (mod 2)`.\nThis means `w_T(x,y) = (-1)^{|V_x| (mod 2)}`. If `|V_x|` is odd, `w_T(x,y)=-1`. If `|V_x|` is even, `w_T(x,y)=1`.\n\nFor an edge `e=(x,y)` to be on the path `P_T(1,n)`, `1` and `n` must be in different components when `e` is removed.\nLet's assume `1` is in `T_x` and `n` is in `T_y`. Let `k = |V_x|`. Then `|V_y| = n-k`.\nThe weight of `e=(x,y)` is `(-1)^k`.\n\nWe need to count how many trees `T` have `e=(x,y)` on `P_T(1,n)` such that `1` is in `T_x` and `|V_x|=k`.\nThis is a standard result in tree counting:\nThe number of trees on `n` labeled vertices such that vertices `1` and `n` are in different components of sizes `k` and `n-k` (where `1` is in the component of size `k`) when an edge `e` on `P_T(1,n)` is removed, is given by:\n`C(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nHere's how this formula is derived:\n1. Choose `k-1` additional vertices (from the `n-2` vertices excluding `1` and `n`) to be in the component containing `1`. This is `C(n-2, k-1)` ways. Let this set be `S_1`. The remaining `n-k` vertices form `S_2` (containing `n`).\n2. Form a tree on the `k` vertices in `S_1`. By Cayley's formula, there are `k^{k-2}` ways.\n3. Form a tree on the `n-k` vertices in `S_2`. By Cayley's formula, there are `(n-k)^{n-k-2}` ways.\n4. Connect these two trees with an edge between a vertex in `S_1` and a vertex in `S_2`. There are `k * (n-k)` ways to choose these two endpoints.\nMultiplying these gives: `C(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2} * k * (n-k) = C(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\n\nSo, the total sum of `d(1,n)` over all good trees is:\n`sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (n-k)^{n-k-1} * (-1)^k`.\n\nLet's test with examples:\n- `n=2`: `n` is even.\n  `k=1`: `C(0,0) * 1^0 * (2-1)^0 * (-1)^1 = 1 * 1 * 1 * (-1) = -1`.\n  Total sum: `-1`. Modulo `998244353`, this is `998244352`. Matches example.\n- `n=4`: `n` is even.\n  `k=1`: `C(2,0) * 1^0 * 3^2 * (-1)^1 = 1 * 1 * 9 * (-1) = -9`.\n  `k=2`: `C(2,1) * 2^1 * 2^1 * (-1)^2 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 8`.\n  `k=3`: `C(2,2) * 3^2 * 1^0 * (-1)^3 = 1 * 9 * 1 * (-1) = -9`.\n  Total sum: `-9 + 8 - 9 = -10`. Modulo `998244353`, this is `998244343`. Matches example.\n\nThe formula is correct.\nThe maximum value of `n` is `5 * 10^5`.\nWe need to compute combinations `C(N, K)` and modular exponentiations `pow(base, exp, MOD)`.\n`C(N, K) = N! / (K! * (N-K)!) = N! * (K!)^(MOD-2) * ((N-K)!)^(MOD-2) (mod MOD)`.\nWe can precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to `n-2`.\nThe loop runs `n-1` times. Each iteration involves `nCr` (constant time after precomputation) and two `pow` operations (`O(log MOD)` time).\nTotal time complexity: `O(n + n log MOD) = O(n log MOD)`. This is efficient enough for `n = 5 * 10^5`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # If n is odd, there are no good trees.
