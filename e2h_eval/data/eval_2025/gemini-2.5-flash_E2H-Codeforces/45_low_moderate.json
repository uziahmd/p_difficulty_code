There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Tennis Championship\" problem and my gut instinct is to break it down. I need a Python script to solve it, but first, let's understand the core logic. The problem boils down to maximizing the number of games the tournament winner plays, with this funky rule about game differences. I'm thinking, \"Let's translate that rule into something concrete.\" It's all about ensuring that the game count difference between two players is at most one.\n\nI'm starting by defining the key variable: the winner, let's call them W. To maximize W's games, I need W to consistently play against opponents who can keep W in the game as long as possible.  I'm thinking about how many players I need to reach a certain number of games for the winner. Let's call that `P(k)`, where k is the number of games the winner has played.\n\nThe base case is simple: `P(0) = 1`.  If the winner hasn't played, they are just one of the initial players.  For one game, `P(1) = 2`.  You need two players, W and an opponent, to have a single game.  The game difference is one, which is valid.\n\nNow, let's generalize this. To have a winner play `k` games, I need to figure out the minimal number of players to support this situation.  The winner, W, has played `k-1` games and is about to play their `k`-th game. W's opponent must have played a number of games close to `k-1`, according to the rule.  This translates to the opponent potentially having `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k` games under their belt.\n\nThis `k` thing is interesting. If the opponent has `k` games already, that doesn't make sense because the winner, W, has only won `k-1`. I'm going to set aside for the moment and make sure my recurrence handles the case correctly. The opponent cannot have won `k` games because W is about to play their `k`-th game, meaning they only have `k-1` wins.\n\nSo, I'll define `f(k)` as the minimum number of players needed for a winner to play `k` games, and I'll revisit these ideas when I'm designing the recurrence.  This `f(k)` will be the building block for the script.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given `n` players and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `W` be the winner of the tournament. We want to maximize the number of games `W` plays.\nLet `k` be the number of games `W` has played. When `W` plays their `k`-th game, they have previously won `k-1` games.\nLet `O` be `W`'s opponent in this `k`-th game. `O` must have won some number of games, say `k_O`.\nThe rule states `abs((k-1) - k_O) <= 1`.\nThis means `k_O` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\nSince `O` will be eliminated if `W` wins, `O` cannot have played more games than `W` (if `O` had played `k` games and `W` `k-1`, and `W` wins, then `W` would have played `k` games, and `O` `k` games, which is fine, but `O` cannot be the ultimate winner if `W` is). To maximize `W`'s games, `W` should always be able to find an opponent.\n\nConsider the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games. Let `P(k)` be this number.\n`P(0) = 1`: A player who hasn't played any games.\n`P(1) = 2`: To play 1 game, `W` must beat an opponent. `W` plays 1 game, opponent plays 0 games. `abs(1-0) = 1 <= 1`. This is valid. We need 2 players.\n\nNow, consider how `W` can play their `k`-th game. `W` has won `k-1` games.\nTo maximize the number of games `W` plays, we want to ensure `W` can always find an opponent.\nThe most \"efficient\" way to produce an opponent for `W` (who has played `k-1` games) is to have an opponent who has played `k-1` games themselves. This requires two sub-tournaments, each producing a winner who has played `k-1` games. `W` is the winner of one such sub-tournament, and `O` is the winner of another.\nIn this case, `W` (winner of `k-1` games) plays `O` (winner of `k-1` games). `abs((k-1)-(k-1)) = 0 <= 1`. This is valid.\nThe number of players needed for this scenario is `P(k-1)` for `W`'s side and `P(k-1)` for `O`'s side, totaling `2 * P(k-1)` players.\n\nAnother possibility is that `W` (winner of `k-1` games) plays an opponent `O` who has won `k-2` games. `abs((k-1)-(k-2)) = 1 <= 1`. This is also valid.\nThe number of players needed for this scenario is `P(k-1)` for `W`'s side and `P(k-2)` for `O`'s side, totaling `P(k-1) + P(k-2)` players.\n\nTo maximize `W`'s games, we should try to use the minimum number of players to allow `W` to play `k` games.\nLet's define `F(k)` as the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\n`F(0) = 1` (a player who hasn't played yet)\n`F(1) = 2` (player A plays player B; A wins 1 game. Requires 2 players)\n\nFor `k > 1`:\nTo play `k` games, `W` must have won `k-1` games. `W` needs an opponent `O`.\nThe opponent `O` must have played `k_O` games such that `abs((k-1) - k_O) <= 1`.\nTo minimize the total number of players `F(k)`, we should choose `O` such that `F(k_O)` is as small as possible, while still allowing `W` to play `k` games.\nThe two valid options for `k_O` are `k-1` and `k-2`.\nIf `O` has played `k-1` games: `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-1) = 2 * F(k-1)`.\nIf `O` has played `k-2` games: `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)`.\n\nTo maximize the number of games `W` plays for a given `n`, we want to find the largest `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\nThe sequence `F(k)` should grow as slowly as possible. This means we should prioritize `F(k-1) + F(k-2)` over `2 * F(k-1)`.\nSo, the recurrence relation for `F(k)` is:\n`F(0) = 1`\n`F(1) = 2`\n`F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence!\nLet `fib(i)` denote the i-th Fibonacci number, with `fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, ...`\nOur sequence `F(k)` corresponds to:\n`F(0) = 1 = fib(2)`\n`F(1) = 2 = fib(3)`\n`F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 2 + 1 = 3 = fib(4)`\n`F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 3 + 2 = 5 = fib(5)`\nIn general, `F(k) = fib(k+2)`.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum `k` such that `fib(k+2) <= n`.\nWe need to generate Fibonacci numbers until `fib(k+2)` exceeds `n`. The previous `k` will be our answer.\n\nExample Walkthrough:\n`n = 2`\n`F(0) = 1`\n`F(1) = 2`. Since `F(1) <= 2`, `k=1` is possible.\n`F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`. Since `F(2) = 3 > 2`, `k=2` is not possible.\nMax `k = 1`.\n\n`n = 3`\n`F(0) = 1`\n`F(1) = 2`\n`F(2) = 3`. Since `F(2) <= 3`, `k=2` is possible.\n`F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`. Since `F(3) = 5 > 3`, `k=3` is not possible.\nMax `k = 2`.\n\n`n = 4`\n`F(0) = 1`\n`F(1) = 2`\n`F(2) = 3`. Since `F(2) <= 4`, `k=2` is possible.\n`F(3) = 5`. Since `F(3) = 5 > 4`, `k=3` is not possible.\nMax `k = 2`.\n\n`n = 10`\n`F(0) = 1`\n`F(1) = 2`\n`F(2) = 3`\n`F(3) = 5`\n`F(4) = 8`. Since `F(4) <= 10`, `k=4` is possible.\n`F(5) = 13`. Since `F(5) = 13 > 10`, `k=5` is not possible.\nMax `k = 4`.\n\nThe logic matches the example outputs.\nThe maximum value of `n` is `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so we won't need to compute too many terms. `fib(90)` is approximately `2.88 * 10^18`. So, `k` will be around 88. A simple loop is efficient enough.\n\nImplementation:\nInitialize `a = 1` (representing `F(0)`) and `b = 2` (representing `F(1)`).\nInitialize `games = 1` (since `F(1)=2` players allows 1 game).\nLoop:\n  Calculate `next_fib = a + b`.\n  If `next_fib > n`, break the loop.\n  Otherwise, update `a = b`, `b = next_fib`, and increment `games`.\nReturn `games`.\n\nEdge case `n=2`:\n`a=1, b=2, games=1`\n`next_fib = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n`3 > 2`, so break.\nReturn `games = 1`.
