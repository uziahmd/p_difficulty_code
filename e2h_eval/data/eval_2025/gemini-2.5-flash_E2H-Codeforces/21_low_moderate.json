The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solving Neko's Grape Problem: A Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem's \"Neko Finds Grapes,\" but really it's about matching chests and keys based on parity: the sum of a chest number and a key number needs to be odd. So, the key insight is to realize that this means one needs to be even and the other odd.\n\nThinking about it, I see that the core idea boils down to how many even and odd numbers we have for chests and keys. I'll need to count:\n\n*   `chests_even`: the number of even numbers among the chest numbers (`a_i`).\n*   `chests_odd`: the number of odd numbers among the chest numbers (`a_i`).\n*   `keys_even`: the number of even numbers among the key numbers (`b_j`).\n*   `keys_odd`: the number of odd numbers among the key numbers (`b_j`).\n\nSince a key can only open one chest, and a chest can only be opened once, this immediately suggests a matching problem.  I can treat the even chests and odd keys as one group and the odd chests and even keys as another. These two groupings are *independent*! The key lies in understanding that the number of pairings in the first group will not impact the number of pairings in the second group.\n\nNow, for any given set of chests and keys, I can make:\n*   `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` matches using even chests and odd keys.\n*   `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` matches using odd chests and even keys.\n\nThis leads to my strategy: the total number of openable chests is simply the sum of these two minima! Easy as that. `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`. This should give me the maximum.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can unlock a chest `a_i` if and only if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that one of `a_i` and `b_j` must be even, and the other must be odd.\nThere are two scenarios for a successful match:\n1.  An even-numbered chest (`a_i` is even) is opened by an odd-numbered key (`b_j` is odd).\n2.  An odd-numbered chest (`a_i` is odd) is opened by an even-numbered key (`b_j` is even).\n\nWe can categorize the chests and keys based on their parity:\n*   Count of even-numbered chests (`chests_even`).\n*   Count of odd-numbered chests (`chests_odd`).\n*   Count of even-numbered keys (`keys_even`).\n*   Count of odd-numbered keys (`keys_odd`).\n\nThe matches for scenario 1 (even chests with odd keys) are independent of the matches for scenario 2 (odd chests with even keys). This is because an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key. Similarly, an odd key can only open an even chest, and an even key can only open an odd chest. Therefore, the resources (chests and keys) used in one scenario are distinct from those used in the other.\n\nTo maximize the number of chests opened:\n*   For even chests and odd keys: The maximum number of matches is limited by the minimum of available even chests and available odd keys. This is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n*   For odd chests and even keys: Similarly, the maximum number of matches is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nThe total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of these two independent maximums:\n`total_opened_chests = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Initialize `chests_even = 0`, `chests_odd = 0`.\n3.  Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`, if it's even, increment `chests_even`; otherwise, increment `chests_odd`.\n4.  Initialize `keys_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`.\n5.  Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`, if it's even, increment `keys_even`; otherwise, increment `keys_odd`.\n6.  Calculate `result = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7.  Print `result`.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it involves a single pass through the chest numbers and a single pass through the key numbers, making its time complexity O(N + M).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n            \n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n            \n    # Number of even chests that can be opened by odd keys\n    matches1 = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n    \n    # Number of odd chests that can be opened by even keys\n    matches2 = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n    \n    print(matches1 + matches2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
