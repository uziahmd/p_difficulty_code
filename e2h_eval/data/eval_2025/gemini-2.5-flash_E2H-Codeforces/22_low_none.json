After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Marks\" Problem: My Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Marks\" problem.  It's a classic competitive programming scenario, and I'm itching to get a Python script working.  Let's break it down and strategize.\n\nFirstly, the problem definition is straightforward: `n` students, `m` subjects, marks from 1 to 9. A student is \"best\" in a subject if no one else scored higher, and a \"successful\" student is best in at least one subject. My goal is to count those successful students.\n\nThe input format is clear: `n` and `m` on the first line, then `n` lines of marks for each student in `m` subjects. The output will be a single integer representing the count of successful students.  The constraints (1 <= n, m <= 100) tell me I don't need to worry too much about optimizing for huge datasets.\n\nThinking about the example, it makes perfect sense. I need to iterate through the gradebook, identify the maximum mark for each subject, and then check which students achieved that maximum mark.  If a student is the best in *any* subject, they're successful.\n\nMy algorithm will look something like this:\n\n1.  Read `n` and `m` from the input.\n2.  Read the gradebook data: I'll store it as a list of lists (or a list of strings and convert as needed). Each inner list represents a student's marks.  This makes accessing and iterating very intuitive.\n3.  Calculate the maximum mark for each subject. I'll create a `max_marks_per_subject` list of size `m` initialized with zeros or ones, then iterate through the gradebook, updating the maximum for each subject as I go.\n4.  Now, I'll iterate through the students. For each student, I'll check if they match the maximum mark in *any* subject. If they do, I'll flag them as successful.\n5. Finally, I'll count the number of successful students and output the result.\n\nI'm confident this'll be a fairly efficient solution given the small constraint bounds. I can't wait to code this up in Python! I'll keep the example in mind to test my script during implementation. Let's get started.\n",
