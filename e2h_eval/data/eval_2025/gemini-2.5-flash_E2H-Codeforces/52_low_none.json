Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**New Year Candles Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"New Year Candles\" problem. Seems straightforward on the surface, but I need a solid plan.  The goal is to maximize the total hours a room is lit, given an initial number of candles and a recycling factor.\n\n**Problem Breakdown:**\nMy input consists of two integers: the initial number of new candles, *a*, and the burnt-out candle recycling factor, *b*.  I need to output the total lit hours.\n\n**My Approach:**\nA simulation seems the way to go.  It's all about keeping track of the current number of *new* and *burnt-out* candles and the total lit hours, and then carefully simulating the whole burning and recycling process.\n\n**The Loop:**\nI'm thinking a loop is key here.  As long as I have new candles to burn, I need to keep simulating. Each new candle provides one hour of light, so that's a direct addition to the total. Then, each burned-out candle becomes a burnt-out candle.\n\n**Recycling Logic:**\nThe core is in the recycling. I'll calculate how many *new* candles I can create from the *burnt-out* candles by integer division.  The remainder of *burnt-out* candles goes back into the burnt-out pile, waiting for the next round of recycling.  I have to ensure to update those quantities at each step.\n\n**Implementation Steps (Mental Checklist):**\n1. Initialize the total lit hours to zero.\n2. Initialize *new_candles* to *a*.\n3. Initialize *burnt_out_candles* to zero.\n4. Loop as long as there are new candles.\n5. In each loop iteration, light all the *new_candles* and update lit hours and *burnt_out_candles*.\n6. Calculate how many new candles I can make from *burnt_out_candles* and update *new_candles* and *burnt_out_candles* accordingly.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (My own test):**\nIt will be a good idea to perform a dry run through the example given to make sure the loop is working correctly. It is a good sanity check to ensure my logic is robust.\n",
