The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Rock-Paper-Scissors Loss Calculator**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to figure out how many times Nikephoros and Polycarpus lose in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.  Standard rules apply, of course: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors snips Paper, and Paper wraps Rock. Draws don't count towards anyone's losses.  They get a \"red spot\" (loss) when their opponent wins.\n\nHere's the setup: Nikephoros has a repeating sequence *A*, and Polycarpus has a repeating sequence *B*.  I'm given the total number of rounds, *n*, along with the sequences *A* and *B*. The goal is to output Nikephoros's losses and Polycarpus's losses.\n\nThe key insight is the cyclical nature of their strategies.  Because they are both playing sequences, the game's state inevitably repeats.  The least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths, *m* (length of *A*) and *k* (length of *B*), represents this cycle length. Let's call this cycle length *L*.\n\nMy plan is to figure out the losses within one complete cycle of *L* rounds, and then scale that up.  Specifically:\n\n1.  **Parse the input**: Read in *n*, *A*, and *B*.\n2.  **Define the core game logic**: I'll make a function, let's call it `get_winner(char_N, char_P)`, to determine the winner of a single round based on the characters Nikephoros and Polycarpus play.  A simple dictionary mapping 'R' to 'S', 'S' to 'P', and 'P' to 'R' will make this straightforward.  If Nikephoros's choice beats Polycarpus's, Nikephoros wins, and vice versa. Draws return 0.\n3.  **Calculate the LCM**:  I'll use the `math.gcd` function and the relationship `lcm(m,k) = (m*k) // gcd(m,k)` to efficiently determine *L*.\n4.  **Calculate Losses per Cycle**: I'll simulate *L* rounds.  For each round *i*:\n    *   Nikephoros plays `A[i % m]`.\n    *   Polycarpus plays `B[i % k]`.\n    *   Determine the winner of the round using `get_winner()`.\n    *   Keep track of Nikephoros's losses (when Polycarpus wins, which is `get_winner()` returns `-1`) and Polycarpus's losses (when Nikephoros wins, which is `get_winner()` returns `1`).\n5.  **Scale and Add Remaining Rounds**: Now, the total losses are calculated:\n    *   Calculate the number of complete cycles: `n // L`.\n    *   Multiply losses per cycle by the number of cycles to get losses for full cycles.\n    *   Calculate the number of remaining rounds: `n % L`.\n    *   Simulate those remaining rounds, calculating losses as described in step 4.\n    *   Sum up the losses from full cycles and the remaining rounds to get the final answers.\n\nThis approach should be efficient and accurate, handling the cyclic nature of the game and giving me the exact loss counts for both players.\n",
