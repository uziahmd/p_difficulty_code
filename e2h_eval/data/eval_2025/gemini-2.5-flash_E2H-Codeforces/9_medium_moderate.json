Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my plan for tackling this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, leveraging my knowledge of dynamic programming and knapsack variations:**\n\nI've got a classic optimization problem on my hands, a variation of the knapsack problem. The core is to pick the most valuable subset of souvenirs (maximizing cost) within a weight limit. The tricky part is the large number of souvenirs (up to 100,000) and the relatively large maximum weight (up to 300,000).  A straightforward dynamic programming approach (O(n*m)) would be too slow.\n\nThe crucial constraint to exploit is the very small weights (1, 2, or 3).  That gives me a significant advantage.  I'm going to categorize the souvenirs by their weights and sort each group by cost in descending order.  Let's call these sorted lists `items_w1`, `items_w2`, and `items_w3`.\n\nThe main idea is to iterate through the possible combinations of how many souvenirs of each weight (1, 2, and 3) to pick. I'll fix the number of weight-3 souvenirs (`k3`).  Since the weight is 3, I can only iterate up to `m/3` for the number of weight 3 items. For a fixed `k3`, I'll calculate the cost and the remaining weight capacity.\n\nThe remaining part of the problem boils down to optimizing for weight-1 and weight-2 items within that reduced capacity.  This is still a knapsack problem with two item types, but due to the weights being 1 and 2, it's amenable to a clever approach.\n\nI'm thinking I can *efficiently* solve the weight-1 and weight-2 subproblem using a combination of greedy techniques or a targeted two-pointer method. The intuition is that for weights 1 and 2, I should prefer the best weight per cost, or compare the cost of one weight 2 item with the cost of two weight 1 items to see if this is better.\n\nTo be precise, let's call `f(W)` the max cost to create capacity `W` using items of weights 1 and 2. I need an efficient way to calculate `f(W)`. Since weights are 1 and 2, and after sorting, I'm always picking the best ones first, I can use a strategy where I compare two consecutive items of weight one vs. one item of weight two. I can construct the result by iterating to create `f(W)` efficiently using pointers for weight 1 and weight 2 items.\n\nSo my approach:\n1.  Sort the souvenir costs by weight (1, 2, 3) in descending order.\n2.  Iterate through `k3` from 0 to `m // 3`.\n3.  For each `k3`:\n    - Calculate the current cost and remaining weight.\n    - Compute `f(remaining_weight)` for the remaining capacity using the efficient two-pointer approach, comparing one weight 2 item with two weight 1 items.\n    - Update the overall maximum cost.\n\nBy doing it this way, I can ensure this runs in O(m) for the two-pointer approach for the subproblem, and O(m/3) * O(m) which simplifies to O(m^2).\n\nThis will give the optimal solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `wi` and cost `ci`, such that their total weight does not exceed `m` and their total cost is maximized. The key constraints are `n <= 100000`, `m <= 300000`, and `wi` is very small: `1 <= wi <= 3`.\n\nThis is a variation of the knapsack problem. A standard 0/1 knapsack DP solution (O(n*m)) would be too slow given the large `n` and `m`. However, the small range of weights (`wi \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}`) is a strong hint for a more specialized approach.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Categorize and Sort Souvenirs:**\n    First, group souvenirs by their weights. For each weight `w \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}`, store the costs of souvenirs with that weight in a separate list. Sort these lists in descending order of cost. This ensures that if we decide to take `k` items of a certain weight, we will always pick the `k` most expensive ones.\n    *   `items_w1`: costs of souvenirs with weight 1, sorted descending.\n    *   `items_w2`: costs of souvenirs with weight 2, sorted descending.\n    *   `items_w3`: costs of souvenirs with weight 3, sorted descending.\n\n2.  **Precompute Prefix Sums:**\n    To quickly get the sum of the `k` most expensive items for each weight category, compute prefix sums for the sorted cost lists.\n    *   `prefix_sum_w1[k]` = sum of costs of the first `k` items in `items_w1`.\n    *   Similarly for `prefix_sum_w2` and `prefix_sum_w3`.\n\n3.  **Iterate on Weight-3 Items:**\n    The maximum weight is `m`. The items with the largest weight are 3. Let's iterate over the number of weight-3 items we take, say `k3`.\n    *   `k3` can range from `0` to `len(items_w3)`.\n    *   The total weight contributed by these `k3` items is `k3 * 3`.\n    *   The total cost contributed by these `k3` items is `prefix_sum_w3[k3]`.\n    *   The remaining weight capacity is `remaining_m = m - k3 * 3`.\n    *   If `remaining_m < 0`, we cannot take `k3` items of weight 3, so we break the loop for `k3`.\n\n4.  **Solve Subproblem for Weight-1 and Weight-2 Items:**\n    For each `k3`, we are left with `remaining_m` capacity and need to fill it optimally using only weight-1 and weight-2 items. This subproblem needs to be solved efficiently.\n\n    Let `dp_w1_w2[w]` be the maximum cost achievable for a capacity `w` using only weight-1 and weight-2 items. We can compute this `dp_w1_w2` array for all `w` from `0` to `m` in `O(m)` time using a two-pointer greedy approach.\n\n    The greedy choice for weight-1 and weight-2 items: At each step, to increase capacity by 1 or 2, we compare the best available options:\n    *   Taking the next most expensive weight-1 item (cost `C1`, weight 1).\n    *   Taking the next most expensive weight-2 item (cost `C2`, weight 2).\n    *   Taking the next two most expensive weight-1 items (cost `C1a + C1b`, weight 2).\n\n    We can build `dp_w1_w2` iteratively:\n    Initialize `dp_w1_w2 = [0] * (m+1)`.\n    Initialize `p1 = 0` (pointer for `items_w1`) and `p2 = 0` (pointer for `items_w2`).\n    `current_cost = 0`.\n\n    For `w` from 1 to `m`:\n        `cost_w1 = -1`\n        if `p1 < len(items_w1)`: `cost_w1 = items_w1[p1]`\n\n        `cost_w2 = -1`\n        if `p2 < len(items_w2)`: `cost_w2 = items_w2[p2]`\n\n        `cost_two_w1 = -1`\n        if `p1 + 1 < len(items_w1)`: `cost_two_w1 = items_w1[p1] + items_w1[p1+1]`\n\n        `best_gain = -1`\n        `choice = 0` # 0: none, 1: one w1, 2: one w2, 3: two w1\n\n        # Consider taking one weight-1 item\n        if `cost_w1 != -1`:\n            `best_gain = cost_w1`\n            `choice = 1`\n        \n        # Consider taking one weight-2 item (only if current capacity >= 2)\n        if `w >= 2` and `cost_w2 != -1`:\n            if `cost_w2 >= best_gain`: # If cost_w2 is better or equal\n                `best_gain = cost_w2`\n                `choice = 2`\n        \n        # Consider taking two weight-1 items (only if current capacity >= 2)\n        if `w >= 2` and `cost_two_w1 != -1`:\n            if `cost_two_w1 >= best_gain`: # If cost_two_w1 is better or equal\n                `best_gain = cost_two_w1`\n                `choice = 3`\n        \n        if `best_gain == -1`: # No more items can be added\n            `dp_w1_w2[w] = dp_w1_w2[w-1]` if `w > 0` else 0\n            continue # No items available, carry over previous value\n        \n        # Apply the best choice\n        if `choice == 1`: # Take one weight-1 item\n            `current_cost += cost_w1`\n            `p1 += 1`\n        elif `choice == 2`: # Take one weight-2 item\n            `current_cost += cost_w2`\n            `p2 += 1`\n        elif `choice == 3`: # Take two weight-1 items\n            `current_cost += cost_two_w1`\n            `p1 += 2`\n        \n        `dp_w1_w2[w] = current_cost`\n\n    This `dp_w1_w2` array will store the maximum cost for capacity `w` using only weight-1 and weight-2 items. This precomputation takes `O(m)` time.\n\n5.  **Combine Results:**\n    After precomputing `dp_w1_w2`, iterate `k3` from 0 to `min(len(items_w3), m // 3)`:\n    *   `current_cost_w3 = prefix_sum_w3[k3]`\n    *   `current_weight_w3 = k3 * 3`\n    *   `remaining_m = m - current_weight_w3`\n    *   `current_cost_w1_w2 = dp_w1_w2[remaining_m]`\n    *   `total_cost = current_cost_w3 + current_cost_w1_w2`\n    *   Update the overall maximum cost found so far.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   Reading input and sorting: `O(N log N)` (dominated by sorting).\n*   Computing prefix sums: `O(N)`.\n*   Computing `dp_w1_w2`: `O(M)`.\n*   Iterating `k3` and combining results: `k3` goes up to `M/3`. Each step is `O(1)` (array lookups). So `O(M)`.\n\nTotal time complexity: `O(N log N + M)`.\nSpace complexity: `O(N + M)` for storing item lists, prefix sums, and the `dp_w1_w2` array.\n\nGiven `N=10^5`, `M=3*10^5`, this solution is efficient enough.\n\n**Example dry run for `dp_w1_w2` calculation:**\n`items_w1 = [10, 5, 1]`\n`items_w2 = [12, 8]`\n`m = 5`\n\n`dp_w1_w2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n`p1 = 0`, `p2 = 0`, `current_cost = 0`\n\n`w = 1`:\n    `cost_w1 = 10` (`items_w1[0]`)\n    `cost_w2 = -1`\n    `cost_two_w1 = -1`\n    `best_gain = 10`, `choice = 1`\n    `current_cost = 10`, `p1 = 1`\n    `dp_w1_w2[1] = 10`\n\n`w = 2`:\n    `cost_w1 = 5` (`items_w1[1]`)\n    `cost_w2 = 12` (`items_w2[0]`)\n    `cost_two_w1 = 10 + 5 = 15` (`items_w1[0] + items_w1[1]`, but `p1` is 1, so `items_w1[1] + items_w1[2]` if `p1` was 0.
