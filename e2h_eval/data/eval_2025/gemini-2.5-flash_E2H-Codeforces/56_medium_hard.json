Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on Guard Duty (Easy)**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem, and my initial thought is: this looks like a perfect matching problem with a geometric constraint. We've got `R` spaceships and `B` bases, and we need to pair them up without their paths crossing. The small bounds on `R` and `B` (up to 10) are the key hint here. It screams \"brute force permutations\" to me.\n\n**Breaking Down the Problem**\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the obvious: `R` must equal `B`. If they don't, it's an immediate \"No\" and we're done. Assuming `R = B`, the core of the problem is the *non-intersecting paths* constraint. This translates to checking line segments - `R1B1` shouldn't cross `R2B2`.\n\n**Geometric Intuition and Implementation**\n\nTo determine if two line segments intersect, I'll use the cross product. This is a standard geometric technique that's efficient to compute.  Specifically, I will calculate the signed areas to determine the orientation of points relative to a line. If the cross products involving a point and a segment have opposite signs, then the point is on the opposite side of the line. Two segments intersect if and only if each segment's endpoints are on opposite sides of the other segment's line.\n\n**Algorithm Design**\n\nSince `R` and `B` are small, I'll go with a brute-force approach. For each possible permutation of bases, I'll form the assignments and check for any intersecting segments. This involves:\n\n1.  Read the input, confirming `R == B`.\n2.  Store coordinates as tuples or lists of numbers.\n3.  Implement a `cross_product` helper function to compute the 2D cross product.\n4.  Implement a `intersect` function using the cross-product to check segments.\n5.  Iterate through all permutations of base assignments: `itertools.permutations`.\n6.  For each permutation, form the segments and then iterate through all *pairs* of segments, checking for intersections.\n7.  If a permutation yields no intersections, print \"Yes\" and terminate.\n8.  If all permutations are exhausted without finding a valid assignment, print \"No\".\n\n**Implementation Details and Optimization**\n\nFor the cross-product, I'll use `(x2 - x1) * (y3 - y1) - (y2 - y1) * (x3 - x1)`. The segment intersection check will use the signs of cross products. Since no three points are collinear (a guarantee), I don't need to consider cases where cross products are zero. This makes the intersection check easier.\n\nThe time complexity is `O(R! * R^2)`. Given `R <= 10`, this should be feasible. The space complexity is `O(R)` to store coordinates and permutation data.\n\n**Edge Cases**\n\nI'll check for the edge case `R=1, B=1`, which should always result in \"Yes\". The problem guarantees no three points are collinear and no two points coincide. This simplifies the intersection logic.\n\n**Example and Final Check**\n\nI've already run through the provided examples in my head. They're helping confirm the logic. The key is in the signed areas with the `cross_product` function and the segment intersection check, so it's essential that these two functions work correctly. I will do a code review and double-check those two functions. This is crucial for correctness. With the cross product and intersection functions checked, the solution should pass. The code is complete!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to connect `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship, and no two connection paths intersect. The paths are straight lines in 2D. We are given the coordinates of the spaceships and bases.\n\n**1. Basic Constraints:**\nFor a perfect matching to exist where each spaceship is assigned to one base and vice-versa, the number of spaceships `R` must be equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, it's impossible, so we immediately output \"No\".\n\n**2. Non-intersecting Paths:**\nThe core of the problem is the non-intersection constraint. Two line segments `P1P2` and `P3P4` intersect if and only if:\n*   Points `P3` and `P4` lie on opposite sides of the line formed by `P1P2`.\n*   Points `P1` and `P2` lie on opposite sides of the line formed by `P3P4`.\n\nTo check if a point `P` is on one side or the other of a directed line `AB`, we can use the 2D cross product. Given three points `A=(x_A, y_A)`, `B=(x_B, y_B)`, and `P=(x_P, y_P)`, the cross product `(x_B - x_A)(y_P - y_A) - (y_B - y_A)(x_P - x_A)` tells us the orientation:\n*   Positive: `P` is to the \"left\" of `AB`.\n*   Negative: `P` is to the \"right\" of `AB`.\n*   Zero: `P` is collinear with `A` and `B`.\n\nThe problem guarantees that no three points are collinear and no two points coincide. This simplifies the intersection check significantly, as we don't need to handle cases where segments touch at endpoints or overlap. If the cross product is never zero for distinct points, then `P3` and `P4` are on opposite sides of `P1P2` if `cross_product(P1, P2, P3)` and `cross_product(P1, P2, P4)` have opposite signs. This can be compactly written as `cross_product(P1, P2, P3) * cross_product(P1, P2, P4) < 0`.\n\nSo, two segments `P1P2` and `P3P4` intersect if and only if:\n`(cross_product(P1, P2, P3) * cross_product(P1, P2, P4) < 0)` AND\n`(cross_product(P3, P4, P1) * cross_product(P3, P4, P2) < 0)`\n\n**3. Algorithm:**\nThe constraints `1 <= R, B <= 10` are very small. This suggests that a brute-force approach checking all possible assignments is feasible.\n\n1.  **Read Input:** Read `R` and `B`, then the coordinates of `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases. Store them in lists.\n2.  **Check `R == B`:** If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n3.  **Handle `R=1`:** If `R=1` (and `B=1`), there's only one spaceship and one base. Only one connection path exists, so there are no other paths to intersect with. Thus, it's always possible. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n4.  **Iterate Permutations:** Since `R = B`, we need to find a permutation of the bases that, when assigned to the spaceships (e.g., spaceship `i` assigned to base `P[i]`), results in no intersecting paths.\n    *   Use `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible orderings of base indices `(0, 1, ..., R-1)`. Each permutation `P` defines an assignment: `(Rebel_0, Base_{P[0]}), (Rebel_1, Base_{P[1]}), ..., (Rebel_{R-1}, Base_{P[R-1]})`.\n    *   For each permutation:\n        *   Construct the list of `R` segments based on the current assignment.\n        *   Check all unique pairs of these `R` segments for intersection using the `intersect` function described above.\n        *   If any pair of segments intersects, this permutation is invalid. Move to the next permutation.\n        *   If all pairs of segments are checked and no intersections are found, then a valid assignment has been found. Print \"Yes\" and terminate the program.\n5.  **No Solution:** If all permutations are checked and none yield a valid assignment, print \"No\".\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Time Complexity: `R!` (number of permutations) * `(R choose 2)` (number of segment pairs) * `O(1)` (intersection check). For `R=10`, this is `10! * (10*9/2) = 3,628,800 * 45`, which is approximately `1.6 * 10^8` operations. This is generally acceptable within typical time limits (1-2 seconds) for competitive programming problems, especially given Python's arbitrary-precision integers which handle large coordinate values without overflow.\n*   Space Complexity: `O(R)` to store points and segments.\n\nThis approach is efficient enough for the given constraints and directly addresses the problem's requirements.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\n# Helper function to calculate the 2D cross product (or twice the signed area of triangle P1P2P3).\n# The sign of the result indicates the orientation of P3 with respect to the directed line P1P2.\n# Returns:\n#   > 0 if P3 is to the left of P1P2\n#   < 0 if P3 is to the right of P1P2\n#   = 0 if P3 is collinear with P1P2 (guaranteed not to happen for distinct points in this problem)\ndef cross_product(p1, p2, p3):\n    return (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Function to check if two line segments P1P2 and P3P4 intersect.\n# This implementation relies on the problem guarantee that no three points are collinear\n# and no two points coincide.
