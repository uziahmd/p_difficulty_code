Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Let's Tackle This \"Feed the Golorp\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to build a Python script to solve this competitive programming problem.  First, let's break down the input structure.  It's a string, representing the golorp's name, and it has a pretty consistent format: `?(` some expression `):` and then some constraints.  Inside the parentheses after the question mark seems to be some kind of arithmetic expression.  After the colon and closing parenthesis, we have a list of comparison constraints. The key is that the underscores, or `_` characters, represent variables. It appears that the expression inside the `?(` and `):` needs to evaluate to *something*, and the constraints help determine the specific values of these variables.\n\nMy instinct is that the expression is an arithmetic problem where the goal is to evaluate as a whole number.  The problem states that all Golorps \"try to eat as little as possible\", which would make me think the answer is to minimize the output from the expression. It's likely that the variables can only be assigned integers from 0 to 9, given the context.\n\nI need to extract the variables and the constraints.  The `_` characters are the variables and they are assigned in the order they appear in the *entire* string, so I'll need to remember that order.  That will determine the order of the output values.\n\nI'll need to parse the golorp's name into these two parts: the expression and the constraints. The expression part is where the jaws and stomach come into play.  The problem tells us that the number of variables depends on the shape of the jaws, so this expression is crucial, right? The constraints are then the relationships between these variables.  Based on the example, variables in the constraints are also represented by underscores.\n\nThe goal seems to be to find a sequence of values (0-9) for each `_` in the order they appear in the name string, that satisfies all the constraints, and that sequence has to be lexicographically smallest.\n\nI think I have a good handle on the problem now. Time to code!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) for variables `_` in a golorp's name such that all conditions are met. If no such sequence exists, output \"false\".\n\nThe golorp's name has two parts: an arithmetic expression and a set of comparison constraints.\nThe expression `?(`...`):` uses `_` variables and operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.\nThe constraints `:-`... are a comma-separated list of comparisons like `_>_`, `_<_`.\nAll `_` characters represent distinct variables. The order they appear in the input string defines their order in the output sequence.\n\nThe core idea is to use backtracking (depth-first search) to try all possible digit assignments (0-9) for each variable, in lexicographical order. When all variables are assigned, we evaluate the expression and check all constraints.\n\n**Detailed Plan:**\n\n1.  **Parse the Golorp Name:**\n    *   Identify the total number of variables (`_`). Let this be `N`.\n    *   Store the original string, replacing each `_` with a placeholder like `f[{i}]` for `i` from 0 to `N-1`. This allows us to use `eval()` safely later.\n    *   Split the string into two parts:\n        *   `expression_str`: The content inside `?(` and `):`.\n        *   `constraints_str`: The content after `:-`.\n    *   Parse the `constraints_str` into a list of tuples, e.g., `(var_idx1, operator, var_idx2)`. For example, `___>__` would map to `(2, '>', 1)` if `___` is the 3rd variable (index 2) and `__` is the 2nd variable (index 1).\n\n2.  **Backtracking Function (`solve(k)`):**\n    *   `k`: The index of the current variable we are trying to assign a value to (from 0 to `N-1`).\n    *   `current_values`: An array of size `N` storing the assigned digits so far.\n    *   **Base Case:** If `k == N` (all variables have been assigned):\n        *   **Evaluate Constraints:** For each constraint `(idx1, op, idx2)`:\n            *   Get `v1 = current_values[idx1]` and `v2 = current_values[idx2]`.\n            *   Check if `v1 op v2` is true. If any constraint is false, this assignment is invalid.\n        *   **Evaluate Expression:**\n            *   Substitute `f[{i}]` in `expression_str` with `current_values[i]`.\n            *   Use `eval()` to calculate the expression's value.\n            *   **Division by Zero:** If a division by zero occurs, this assignment is invalid. `eval()` will raise `ZeroDivisionError`, which we must catch.\n            *   **Non-Integer Result:** If the result of division is not an integer (e.g., `5/2` is `2.5`), this assignment is invalid. We can check `value % 1 != 0`.\n            *   **Negative Result:** If the expression evaluates to a negative integer, this assignment is invalid.\n        *   If all checks pass, we have found a valid assignment. Since we are searching in lexicographical order, this is the *first* (and thus lexicographically smallest) valid assignment. Store it and return `True`.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** For `digit` from 0 to 9:\n        *   `current_values[k] = digit`\n        *   Call `solve(k + 1)`.\n        *   If `solve(k + 1)` returns `True`, it means a valid assignment was found further down the path, so propagate `True` upwards.\n\n3.  **Main Logic:**\n    *   Initialize `N = 0` and `variable_map = {}` (to map original `_` positions to `f[{i}]`).\n    *   Iterate through the input string to count `_` and build `variable_map`.\n    *   Replace `_` with `f[{i}]` in the input string.\n    *   Parse `expression_str` and `constraints_list`.\n    *   Initialize `current_values` array.\n    *   Call `solve(0)`.\n    *   If `solve(0)` returns `True`, print the `current_values` joined as a string.\n    *   Otherwise (no solution found), print \"false\".\n\n**Example Trace for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` with output `0010`:**\n\n1.  **Parsing:**\n    *   `N = 4` (variables `f[0]` to `f[3]`)\n    *   `expression_str = \"f[0]-f[1]/f[2]*f[3]\"`\n    *   `constraints_list = [(2, '>', 3)]` (because `___` is `f[2]` and `__` is `f[3]`)\n\n2.  **`solve(0)`:**\n    *   `k=0`: try `f[0]=0`\n        *   `solve(1)`:\n            *   `k=1`: try `f[1]=0`\n                *   `solve(2)`:\n                    *   `k=2`: try `f[2]=0`\n                        *   `solve(3)`:\n                            *   `k=3`: try `f[3]=0`\n                                *   `solve(4)` (base case, `current_values = [0,0,0,0]`):\n                                    *   Constraint `f[2]>f[3]` (0>0) is `False`. Return `False`.\n                            *   `k=3`: try `f[3]=1`\n                                *   `solve(4)` (base case, `current_values = [0,0,0,1]`):\n                                    *   Constraint `f[2]>f[3]` (0>1) is `False`.

All checks pass.\n                                        *   Store `[0,0,1,0]`. Return `True`.\n                                *   `solve(3)` returns `True`, so `solve(2)` returns `True`.\n                            *   `solve(2)` returns `True`, so `solve(1)` returns `True`.\n                        *   `solve(1)` returns `True`, so `solve(0)` returns `True`.\n\n3.  **Result:** `0010` is printed.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Global variables to store parsed information and the solution\nnum_variables = 0\nexpression_template = \"\"\nconstraints = []\nsolution_found = False\nresult_values = []\n\n# Function to evaluate an expression safely, handling division by zero and non-integer results\ndef evaluate_expression(values):\n    global expression_template\n    \n    # Create a dictionary for local evaluation scope\n    # f[0]...f[N-1] will be replaced by actual digits\n    eval_scope = {f'f[{i}]': values[i] for i in range(num_variables)}\n\n    try:\n        # Use eval with a restricted global scope and the custom local scope\n        # This prevents arbitrary code execution while allowing variable substitution\n        # The __builtins__={} restricts built-in functions\n        evaluated_value = eval(expression_template, {\"__builtins__\": {}}, eval_scope)\n        \n        # Check for non-integer results from division\n        if not isinstance(evaluated_value, int) and evaluated_value % 1 != 0:\n            return None # Invalid non-integer result\n        \n        # Check for negative results\n        if evaluated_value < 0:\n            return None # Invalid negative result\n\n        return int(evaluated_value) # Return as integer\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return None # Division by zero\n    except Exception:\n        # Catch other potential errors during evaluation (e.g., malformed expression, though problem guarantees valid)\n        return None\n\n# Backtracking function to find the lexicographically smallest solution\ndef solve(k, current_values):\n    global num_variables, constraints, solution_found, result_values\n\n    if solution_found:\n        return True # A solution has already been found, no need to search further\n\n    if k == num_variables:\n        # All variables have been assigned values\n        \n        # 1.
