In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Mahjong Problem: My Thinking Process**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Mahjong problem to tackle. The goal is to find the fewest extra tiles needed for Tokitsukaze to get a meld, or \"mentsu,\" starting with three tiles. A mentsu is either a koutsu (three of a kind) or a shuntsu (a run of three in the same suit).\n\nFirst things first, let's represent the tiles in a way that's easy to work with.  I'll translate the input strings, like \"1s\" or \"9m,\" into tuples like `(1, 's')` or `(9, 'm')`, where the number is the first element and the suit is the second.\n\nThe problem screams \"optimization,\" so I'm thinking, let's try different scenarios: 0 draws, 1 draw, 2 draws. It's highly unlikely more than two draws will be necessary. With two draws, we'll have five tiles, and with enough options, a meld should almost always be possible. Let's confirm: 0 draws gives us 3 tiles, 1 draw makes 4, and 2 draws equals 5.\n\nNow, let's start with the base case: **Zero Draws.**  Can we make a mentsu with just the initial three tiles, `t1, t2, t3`?  A mentsu *has* to use all three, so we need to directly check for a koutsu or a shuntsu within that set.\n\nChecking for a koutsu is straightforward: are all three tiles identical?  For a shuntsu, they need to be the same suit and the numbers should be consecutive. To make that easier, I'll sort the tiles by suit, and then by number (if the suits are the same).  This lets me easily compare numbers for a potential shuntsu. For example: `['3p', '9m', '2p']` -> `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]` should be sorted to `[(2, 'p'), (3, 'p'), (9, 'm')]`.\n\nSo, I'll write a function, `is_mentsu(tiles)`, that takes a list of three tiles (in my tuple format) and checks for koutsu or shuntsu.  I will write helper functions for the koutsu and shuntsu check. Let's see... a simple function for parsing the tiles will also be useful.\n\nEssentially, I'll test if a shuntsu is found by sorting the tiles, and checking if the suit and numerical values are sequential. I have a plan!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nWe need to check the minimum number of draws, which implies checking 0 draws, then 1 draw, then 2 draws. It's guaranteed that at most 2 draws are needed.\n\nLet's represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`, where `number` is an integer from 1 to 9 and `suit` is 'm', 'p', or 's'.\n\n**1. Parse Input Tiles:**\nThe input consists of three strings like \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\". We'll convert these into a list of `(number, suit)` tuples.\n\n**2. Check for 0 Draws:**\nWith 0 draws, Tokitsukaze has her initial three tiles. We need to check if these three tiles already form a mentsu.\n*   **Koutsu:** Check if all three tiles are identical.\n*   **Shuntsu:** Check if all three tiles are of the same suit and their numbers are sequential (e.g., `x, x+1, x+2`). To do this efficiently, sort the three tiles by number first if they share the same suit.\n\nIf a mentsu is found, the answer is 0.\n\n**3. Check for 1 Draw:**\nIf no mentsu is found with 0 draws, we consider drawing one extra tile. This means Tokitsukaze will have four tiles in total. A mentsu requires exactly three tiles. So, we need to check if any combination of three tiles out of the four can form a mentsu.\nThe four tiles will be `[t1, t2, t3, t_drawn]`.\nWe can iterate through all possible tiles `t_drawn` (9 numbers * 3 suits = 27 possibilities). For each `t_drawn`, we form a hand of four tiles. Then, we check all `C(4, 3) = 4` combinations of three tiles from this hand to see if any of them form a mentsu.\n\nA more direct approach for 1 draw:\nWe need to form a koutsu or a shuntsu using two of the initial tiles `(t_i, t_j)` and one drawn tile `t_k`. Or using one initial tile `t_i` and two drawn tiles `(t_k, t_l)`. The problem states we only need *one* mentsu, and we want to draw minimum tiles.\nIf we draw one tile, we have 4 tiles. We need to form a mentsu from any 3 of them.\nThis means we need to find if there exist two initial tiles `t_i, t_j` such that `t_i, t_j, t_k` form a mentsu for some `t_k`.\n*   **To form a Koutsu:** If two initial tiles `t_i, t_j` are identical, we can draw a third identical tile `t_i` (which is `t_j` too) to form a koutsu.\n*   **To form a Shuntsu:** If two initial tiles `t_i, t_j` are of the same suit:\n    *   If their numbers are `x, x+1`, we can draw `x-1` (if `x>1`) or `x+2` (if `x<8`) to form a shuntsu.\n    *   If their numbers are `x, x+2`, we can draw `x+1` to form a shuntsu.\n\nWe can iterate through all pairs of initial tiles `(t1, t2), (t1, t3), (t2, t3)` and check if drawing one tile can complete a mentsu with that pair.\nIf such a `t_drawn` exists for any pair, the answer is 1.\n\n**4. Check for 2 Draws:**\nIf no mentsu is found with 0 or 1 draw, we consider drawing two extra tiles. This means Tokitsukaze will have five tiles in total.\nWe need to form a koutsu or shuntsu using:\n*   One initial tile `t_i` and two drawn tiles.\n*   Zero initial tiles and three drawn tiles. (This is always possible by drawing three identical tiles, e.g., \"1m 1m 1m\", or \"1m 2m 3m\").\n\nSince we can always draw three identical tiles to form a koutsu, we can achieve a mentsu with 2 draws if we have at least 1 initial tile and draw 2 more (total 3 tiles for the koutsu), or if we draw 3 tiles (total 3 tiles for the koutsu). The minimum number of tiles needed to form a mentsu is 3. If we draw 2 tiles, we have 5 tiles. We can always form a mentsu from 5 tiles by drawing any three tiles that form a mentsu. For example, draw \"1m\", \"1m\", \"1m\". This forms a koutsu. So, 2 draws is always sufficient.\n\nTherefore, if 0 draws and 1 draw don't yield a mentsu, the answer must be 2.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input:** Read the three tile strings and convert them into a list of `(number, suit)` tuples. Let this be `initial_tiles`.\n2.  **Check 0 Draws:**\n    *   Iterate through all permutations of `initial_tiles` (there's only one unique set of 3 tiles, but sorting helps for shuntsu check).\n    *   For `t1, t2, t3`:\n        *   If `t1 == t2 == t3` (koutsu), return 0.\n        *   Sort `t1, t2, t3` by number. If `t1[1] == t2[1] == t3[1]` AND `t1[0]+1 == t2[0]` AND `t2[0]+1 == t3[0]` (shuntsu), return 0.\n3.  **Check 1 Draw:**\n    *   Create a list `unique_tiles_sorted` from `initial_tiles` and sort them by suit then by number. This helps in efficiently finding pairs.\n    *   Iterate through all pairs of tiles `(t_i, t_j)` from `initial_tiles`.\n    *   **For Koutsu:** If `t_i == t_j`, we can draw `t_i` to form a koutsu. Return 1.\n    *   **For Shuntsu:** If `t_i[1] == t_j[1]` (same suit):\n        *   Let `n_i = t_i[0]` and `n_j = t_j[0]`.\n        *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) <= 2`: This means they are `x, x+1` or `x, x+2` or `x, x`.\n            *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 0` (i.e., `t_i == t_j`): This is handled by the koutsu check. If we didn't return 1 for koutsu, it means no identical pair.\n            *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 1` (e.g., `2m, 3m`): We can draw `1m` or `4m` (if valid number) to form a shuntsu. Return 1.\n            *   If `abs(n_i - n_j) == 2` (e.g., `2m, 4m`): We can draw `3m` to form a shuntsu. Return 1.\n4.  **Default to 2 Draws:**\n    *   If neither 0 draws nor 1 draw results in a mentsu, then 2 draws are needed. Return 2.\n\n**Example Walkthroughs:**\n\n*   **Input: `1s 2s 3s`**\n    *   Parsed: `[(1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's')]`\n    *   Check 0 draws: Sort `[(1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's')]`. Same suit, numbers 1, 2, 3 are sequential. It's a shuntsu.\n    *   Output: `0`\n\n*   **Input: `9m 9m 9m`**\n    *   Parsed: `[(9, 'm'), (9, 'm'), (9, 'm')]`\n    *   Check 0 draws: All tiles are `(9, 'm')`. They are identical. It's a koutsu.\n    *   Output: `0`\n\n*   **Input: `3p 9m 2p`**\n    *   Parsed: `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`\n    *   Check 0 draws:\n        *   Are they identical? No.\n        *   Are they same suit and sequential? No (suits are mixed).\n        *   No mentsu with 0 draws.\n    *   Check 1 draw:\n        *   Pairs: `((3, 'p'), (9, 'm'))`, `((3, 'p'), (2, 'p'))`, `((9, 'm'), (2, 'p'))`\n        *   Consider `((3, 'p'), (2, 'p'))`: Same suit 'p'. Numbers 2, 3. `abs(2-3) = 1`.\n            *   We can draw `1p` to form `[1p, 2p, 3p]` (shuntsu).\n            *   We can draw `4p` to form `[2p, 3p, 4p]` (shuntsu).\n            *   Since we can complete a shuntsu by drawing one tile, the answer is 1.\n    *   Output: `1`\n\nThis logic covers all cases and provides the minimum number of draws.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    \"\"\"Parses a tile string like '1s' into (number, suit) tuple.\"\"\"\n    return (int(s[0]), s[1])\n\ndef solve():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    tiles_str = line\n\n    initial_tiles = [parse_tile(s) for s in tiles_str]\n\n    # Sort tiles for consistent processing, especially for shuntsu checks.\n    # Sort by suit, then by number.\n    initial_tiles.sort(key=lambda t: (t[1], t[0]))\n\n    # --- Check 0 Draws ---\n    # A mentsu requires exactly 3 tiles.
