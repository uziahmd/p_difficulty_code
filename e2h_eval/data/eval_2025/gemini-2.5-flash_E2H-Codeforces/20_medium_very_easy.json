    "thought": "**Reflecting on a Python Solution for a Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem where I need to count the ways to assign values to binary strings' prefix counts, ultimately leading to a \"beautiful\" multiset. The goal is to maximize the multiset size to a value `f` and then count all possible configurations. It's modulo 998244353. I see it as a dynamic programming task on a complete binary tree structure where each node corresponds to a binary string and we want to optimize the flow.\n\nThe core of the problem is determining the maximum size of this beautiful multiset. I think of it as a tree.  Each string has associated `c_s` values and the count of strings with the prefix cannot exceed this value. Let's call the length of a string `L` and the current count `count(s)`. If a shorter binary string is a prefix of many strings, we are constrained by the smaller string counts. The beauty constraints are `count(s) <= c_s` for strings `s` of length `1` to `n`. It's equivalent to saying that for a string `s`, count of all strings with `s` as prefix cannot be larger than `c_s`.  We define `dp[s]` as the maximum number of strings with prefix s.\n\nThe key insight seems to be that it's a dynamic programming problem on this tree. The maximum size of the multiset is `dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"]`. I can calculate `dp[s]` recursively:\nFor a string `s` of length `n`: `dp[s] = c_s`.\nFor a string `s` of length `L < n`: `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`, since `dp[s0]` and `dp[s1]` are the count for children.\n\nNow, I need to count how many ways I can choose `c_s` values such that `dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"]` equals a target `f`.  The complexity is going to explode if I'm not careful.  Each `c_s` could be `0` to `k`. There are `2(2^n - 1)` strings, which means at most `(k+1)^(2(2^n - 1))` combinations. This is an enormous number! I need a structured approach.\n\nHere's how I plan to approach this using DP: Let `dp_ways[L][val]` be the count of ways to assign `c_s` values to nodes at or below strings of length `L`, such that the maximum prefix count for strings of length `L` is `val`. Base case: when `L` is equal to `n`. When the string length is `n` all we have to do is choose `c_s = val`. For `L=n`: `dp_ways[n][val] = 1` if `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\nRecursively, for `L < n`, `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.  This is tricky because I need to consider all possible values of `c_s`, and the two children `dp[s0]` and `dp[s1]` values which will affect the result.  I can express this using a nested sum. `dp_ways[L][val] = sum over c_s from 0 to k of  sum over all valid  val_0 and val_1, where min(c_s, val_0+val_1)=val  of dp_ways[L+1][val_0] * dp_ways[L+1][val_1]` where `dp[s0] = val_0` and `dp[s1]=val_1`.\n\nSo `dp_ways[L][val]` can be computed from `dp_ways[L+1]`. I define an auxiliary value, let `S_ways[L+1][sum_val] = sum_{val_0 + val_1 = sum_val} dp_ways[L+1][val_0] * dp_ways[L+1][val_1]`, this is the convolution between `dp_ways[L+1]` and itself. To optimize this, I should be using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform), since I'll be doing polynomial multiplication.\n\nNow, for a specific `c_s`, `min(c_s, val_0 + val_1) == val`, which translates to two cases: if `val < c_s`, then `val_0",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to assign integer values `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) to every binary string `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of strings of length `n` is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo `998244353`.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined.\nLet `dp[s]` be the maximum number of strings in a beautiful multiset that have `s` as a prefix.\nThe conditions for a beautiful multiset are:\n1. For any string `s` of length `n`, `dp[s]` cannot exceed `c_s`.\n2. For any string `s` of length `L < n`, `dp[s]` must be equal to `dp[s0] + dp[s1]` (where `s0` and `s1` are `s` followed by `0` and `1` respectively). Also, `dp[s]` cannot exceed `c_s`.\n\nTo maximize `dp[s]`, we can define it recursively:\n- If `len(s) = n`: `dp[s] = c_s`.\n- If `len(s) < n`: `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\n\nA crucial observation is that `dp[s]` can never exceed `k`. This is because `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`, and `c_s` is always `0 <= c_s <= k`. Therefore, `dp[s] <= k`. This limits the range of values we need to consider for `dp[s]`.\n\nThe maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is `dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"]`. We need this sum to be exactly `f`.\n\nSince all binary strings of the same length are structurally equivalent in terms of their descendants, we can use dynamic programming on the length `L` of the strings.\nLet `dp_ways[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_x` values for all strings `x` that are descendants of an arbitrary string `s` of length `L` (including `s` itself), such that `dp[s]` evaluates to `val`.\nThe `val` here ranges from `0` to `k`.\n\n**Base Case: `L = n`**\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `dp[s] = c_s`.\nWe need `dp[s] = val`, which means `c_s = val`.\nSince `c_s` can be any integer from `0` to `k`, there is only `1` way to choose `c_s` if `0 <= val <= k`.\nSo, `dp_ways[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step: `L < n`**\nFor a string `s` of length `L`, `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\nTo compute `dp_ways[L][val]`:\nWe need to sum over all possible choices of `c_s` (from `0` to `k`), and all possible values for `dp[s0]` (`val_0`) and `dp[s1]` (`val_1`).\n`dp_ways[L][val] = sum_{c_s=0 to k} sum_{val_0=0 to k} sum_{val_1=0 to k} [min(c_s, val_0 + val_1) == val] * dp_ways[L+1][val_0] * dp_ways[L+1][val_1]`\n\nLet `S_ways[L+1][sum_val]` be the number of ways to choose `val_0, val_1` such that `val_0 + val_1 = sum_val`, and `dp[s0]=val_0`, `dp[s1]=val_1`.\n`S_ways[L+1][sum_val] = sum_{val_0=0 to k} dp_ways[L+1][val_0] * dp_ways[L+1][sum_val - val_0]`.\nThis is a polynomial convolution: `S_ways[L+1]` is the convolution of `dp_ways[L+1]` with itself. The maximum `sum_val` can be `k + k = 2k`.\n\nNow, we can rewrite `dp_ways[L][val]`:\n`dp_ways[L][val] = sum_{c_s=0 to k} ( sum_{sum_val | min(c_s, sum_val) == val} S_ways[L+1][sum_val] )`\n\nFor a fixed `c_s` and `val`:\n- If `val < c_s`: `min(c_s, sum_val) == val` implies `sum_val == val`. The contribution is `S_ways[L+1][val]`.\n- If `val == c_s`: `min(c_s, sum_val) == val` implies `sum_val >= val`. The contribution is `sum_{sum_val=val to 2k} S_ways[L+1][sum_val]`.\n- If `val > c_s`: `min(c_s, sum_val) == val` is impossible. Contribution is `0`.\n\nCombining these for `dp_ways[L][val]`:\n`dp_ways[L][val] = (sum_{c_s=val+1 to k} S_ways[L+1][val]) + (if val <= k then sum_{sum_val=val to 2k} S_ways[L+1][sum_val] else 0)`\nThe `sum_{c_s=val+1 to k} S_ways[L+1][val]` term means `(k - val)` copies of `S_ways[L+1][val]`.\nLet `suff_S_ways[L+1][x] = sum_{j=x to 2k} S_ways[L+1][j]`. This can be precomputed efficiently.\nSo, for `0 <= val <= k`:\n`dp_ways[L][val] = ((k - val) * S_ways[L+1][val] + suff_S_ways[L+1][val]) % MOD`.\n\nThe maximum value of `k` is `2 * 10^5`. A naive `O(k^2)` convolution would be too slow. We must use Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for `O(k log k)` convolution. The modulus `998244353` is a prime suitable for NTT.\n\n**Final Step:**\nAfter iterating `L` from `n-1` down to `1`, `dp_ways[1]` will contain the counts for `dp[s]` where `len(s)=1`.\nThe problem asks for `dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"] = f`. This is another convolution:\n`final_ans = sum_{val_0=0 to k} dp_ways[1][val_0] * dp_ways[1][f - val_0]`.\nThis is `S_ways[1][f]` if we were to compute it.\nWe perform one final convolution of `dp_ways[1]` with itself and pick the `f`-th element.\nThe maximum `f` is `2k`. If `f` exceeds `2k`, the answer is `0`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Initialize `current_dp_ways = [1] * (k + 1)` (representing `dp_ways[n]`).\n2. For `L` from `n-1` down to `1`:\n   a. Compute `S_ways = multiply_poly(current_dp_ways, current_dp_ways)`. `S_ways` will have length `2k+1` (indices `0` to `2k`).\n   b. Compute `suff_S_ways`: `suff_S_ways[j] = sum_{i=j to 2k} S_ways[i]`. This can be done by iterating `j` from `2k` down to `0`.\n   c. Initialize `next_dp_ways = [0] * (k + 1)`.\n   d. For `val` from `0` to `k`:\n      `next_dp_ways[val] = ((k - val) * S_ways[val] + suff_S_ways[val]) % MOD`.\n   e. Set `current_dp_ways = next_dp_ways`.\n3. After the loop, `current_dp_ways` holds `dp_ways[1]`.\n4. Compute `final_S_ways = multiply_poly(current_dp_ways, current_dp_ways)`.\n5. If `f` is greater than or equal to `len(final_S_ways)` (which is `2k+1`), print `0`. Otherwise, print `final_S_ways[f]`.\n\n**NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) Details:**\n- `MOD = 998244353` (a prime number, `MOD-1 = 119 * 2^23`).\n- `PRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3` (a primitive root modulo `MOD`).\n- The `multiply_poly` function takes two lists of coefficients, pads them to the next power of 2 greater than or equal to their combined degree, applies NTT, point-wise multiplies, applies inverse NTT, and returns the result.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- `n` iterations.\n- Each iteration involves:\n    - One NTT-based convolution: `O(K log K)` where `K` is `2k`.\n    - `suff_S_ways` computation: `O(k)`.\n    - `next_dp_ways` computation: `O(k)`.\n- Total time complexity: `O(n * k log k)`.\n- Given `n <= 15`, `k <= 2 * 10^5`, this is `15 * 2 * 10^5 * log(4 * 10^5) approx 15 * 2 * 10^5 * 19 approx 5.7 * 10^7`, which is feasible within typical time limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the modulus for arithmetic operations\nMOD = 998244353\n# Define a primitive root modulo MOD, used in NTT\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n# Function to compute (base^exp) % MOD\ndef power(base, exp):\n    res = 1\n    base %= MOD\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % MOD\n        base = (base * base) % MOD\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\n# Function to compute modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem\ndef inverse(n):\n    return power(n, MOD - 2)\n\n# Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) function\n# a: list of polynomial coefficients\n# invert: boolean, True for inverse NTT, False for forward NTT\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    \n    # Bit-reversal permutation\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    # Iterative Cooley-Tukey NTT\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        w_len = power(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (2 * len_half))\n        if invert:\n            w_len = inverse(w_len)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, 2 * len_half):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * w_len) % MOD\n        len_half *= 2\n\n    # Scale by inverse of n for inverse NTT\n    if invert:\n        n_inv = inverse(n)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n    return a\n\n# Function to multiply two polynomials using NTT\ndef multiply_poly(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    # The result polynomial will have degree (len_a - 1) + (len_b - 1)\n    # So, it will have len_a + len_b - 1 coefficients.\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    # Find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to result_len\n    n = 1\n    while n < result_len:\n        n <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad the coefficient lists with zeros to length n\n    a_padded = list(a) + [0] * (n - len_a)\n    b_padded = list(b) + [0] * (n - len_b)\n    \n    # Apply forward NTT to both padded lists\n    ntt(a_padded, False)\n    ntt(b_padded, False)\n    \n    # Point-wise multiplication in the frequency domain\n    c_padded = [(a_padded[i] * b_padded[i]) % MOD for i in range(n)]\n    \n    # Apply inverse NTT to get the coefficients of the product polynomial\n    ntt(c_padded, True)\n    \n    # Return the relevant part of the result (up to result_len)\n    return c_padded[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # current_dp_ways[val] stores the number of ways to assign c_x values for the subtree\n    # rooted at a string of length L, such that the max_size for that string is val.\n    # val ranges from 0 to k.\n    \n    # Base case: L = n.
