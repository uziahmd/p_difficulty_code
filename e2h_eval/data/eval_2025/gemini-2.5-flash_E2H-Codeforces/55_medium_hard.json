    "thought": "**Understanding Lexicographically Smallest Strings with Swaps**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with figuring out the smallest string I can make by rearranging characters in a given string, using specific swap rules. The crucial part is that a '0' can swap with a '1', and a '1' can swap with a '2', but a '0' and a '2' *cannot* swap directly. This is the heart of the problem!\n\nWhat this means is that the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed; they can't cross each other. If I see a '0' followed by a '2' in the original, it'll always be '0...2' in the final string. The '1's, however, are completely fluid. They can move past any '0' or '2', acting like a set of independent units.\n\nTo get the lexicographically smallest string, I want to arrange it like this: all '0's first, then all '1's, and finally all '2's. The key is how to do this considering the '0' and '2's can't move relative to each other.\n\nThe Strategy is this: I'll first remove all '1's from the original string. This leaves me with a subsequence containing only '0's and '2's, which I'll call `s_02`. This `s_02` represents the fixed order of '0's and '2's.\n\nI then count the total number of '1's present (let's call it `count_1`). Now I have `s_02`, representing the fixed '0' and '2' locations and a group of `count_1` ones which can be inserted somewhere into `s_02`.\n\nTo make the final result, I need to insert these '1's in the best location relative to `s_02`. What I do is to place all the zeros that come before the first '2' in `s_02`. Then, I insert all the ones in `s_02` right after these zeros, before the '2'. Then all the remaining part of `s_02`, from the first '2' up to the end, goes at the end of the string.\n\nThis works because the '1's, being fully independent, can be grouped together and moved around. And the goal is to make all the '0's as left as possible to minimize the strings lexicographically.\n\nI can do this efficiently by looping through the original string to extract the `s_02` subsequence, find the first '2' in it (if there is one), and then use that information to construct the final string using string slicing and `count_1` ones.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0's and '1's, or adjacent '1's and '2's. Swapping adjacent '0's and '2's is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' <-> '1': An adjacent '0' and '1' can swap positions. This means a '1' can move left past a '0', and a '0' can move right past a '1'.\n2. '1' <-> '2': An adjacent '1' and '2' can swap positions. This means a '1' can move right past a '2', and a '2' can move left past a '1'.\n\nA crucial observation is that '0's and '2's cannot swap directly. This implies that the relative order of '0's and '2's in the string is invariant. For example, if we have the string \"0...2\" (meaning a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string), no sequence of allowed operations can change their relative order to \"2...0\". The '1's can move between them, but they cannot \"carry\" a '0' past a '2' or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the subsequence formed by taking only the '0's and '2's from the original string will remain the same in any reachable string. For example, if the original string is \"100210\", the subsequence of '0's and '2's is \"0020\". Any string we can obtain will have \"0020\" as its '0's and '2's subsequence.\n\nThe '1's, however, can move past '0's (to their left) and past '2's (to their right). This means a '1' can effectively \"float\" and move past any '0' or '2' character. Consequently, all '1's can be grouped together into a single block, and this block can be inserted anywhere into the fixed subsequence of '0's and '2's.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\nGiven the invariant subsequence of '0's and '2's (let's call it `S_02`) and a count of '1's (`count_1`), we need to insert `count_1` ones into `S_02` optimally.\n\nConsider `S_02`. It's a string of '0's and '2's.\nExample: `S_02 = \"0020\"`, `count_1 = 2`.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest:\n1. We want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning. Any '0' in `S_02` that appears before the *first* '2' in `S_02` can be placed at the very beginning of the final string. These '0's are not \"trapped\" by any preceding '2'.\n2. After these initial '0's, the next smallest character is '1'. Since all '1's can be grouped, we should place all `count_1` ones here.\n3. Finally, the remaining part of `S_02` (which starts with the first '2' and includes all subsequent '0's and '2's) must follow. Any '0's in this part cannot move before the '2's that precede them due to the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nThis leads to the following algorithm:\n1. Iterate through the input string `s`.\n2. Collect all '0's and '2's into a list or string, preserving their relative order. Let's call this `s_02`.\n3. Count the total number of '1's in `s`. Let this be `count_1`.\n4. Find the index of the first occurrence of '2' in `s_02`. Let this be `idx_first_2`.\n   - If no '2' is found (`idx_first_2` is -1), it means `s_02` consists only of '0's. In this case, the optimal string is all '0's from `s_02`, followed by all '1's.\n   - If a '2' is found:\n     - The part of `s_02` before `idx_first_2` consists only of '0's. These go first.\n     - Then, all `count_1` ones go.\n     - Then, the rest of `s_02` (from `idx_first_2` to the end) goes.\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `s_02` characters: `['0', '0', '2', '0']` -> `s_02 = \"0020\"`\n2. `count_1 = 2`\n3. `s_02.find('2')` returns `2` (index of the first '2').\n4. Construct the result:\n   - `s_02[0:2]` = \"00\"\n   - `'1' * 2` = \"11\"\n   - `s_02[2:]` = \"20\"\n   Result: \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\".\n\nThis approach correctly handles all example cases and edge cases (strings with no '1's, no '0's, no '2's, or combinations).\n\nThe time complexity will be O(N) for string processing (iterating, joining, finding), where N is the length of the input string. The space complexity will be O(N) for storing intermediate strings. Given N up to $10^5$, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    s_02_chars = []\n    count_1 = 0\n\n    # Separate '0's and '2's from '1's\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count_1 += 1\n        else:\n            s_02_chars.append(char)\n    \n    s_02 = \"\".join(s_02_chars)\n\n    # Find the first occurrence of '2' in the '0's and '2's subsequence\n    # This index determines where the block of '1's should be inserted\n    idx_first_2 = s_02.find('2')\n\n    result_parts = []\n\n    if idx_first_2 == -1:\n        # Case 1: No '2's in s_02 (meaning s_02 contains only '0's or is empty)\n        # All '0's come first, then all '1's.\n        result_parts.append(s_02)\n        result_parts.append('1' * count_1)\n    else:\n        # Case 2: '2's exist in s_02\n        # '0's before the first '2' in s_02\n        result_parts.append(s_02[0:idx_first_2])\n        # All '1's\n        result_parts.append('1' * count_1)\n        # The rest of s_02 (from the first '2' onwards)\n        result_parts.append(s_02[idx_first_2:])\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(result_parts) + \"\\n\")\n\n# Call the solve function to process the input\nsolve()\n\n```",
