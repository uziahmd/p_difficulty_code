The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition for Rock-Paper-Scissors**\n\nOkay, so we're tasked with figuring out the total \"pinches\" (losses) for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, in a cyclic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The core idea is that both players have repeating sequences of moves, and since the input size `n` (rounds) is huge, we need to leverage this cyclic nature. We can't simulate every single round.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input: `n` (total rounds), and the move sequences for Nikephoros (`A`) and Polycarpus (`B`). From the sequences, I'll determine their lengths, `m` and `k`, which determine the cycle lengths.\n\nThe clever bit is recognizing that the combined game state—the pair of moves played in a given round—also has a cycle. This cycle repeats every `lcm(m, k)` rounds, where `lcm` is the least common multiple.  Since we can efficiently compute the LCM using `gcd` (greatest common divisor) and the formula `lcm(m, k) = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)`, this gives us a manageable cycle length (at most 10^6). This cycle length is the key to an efficient solution.\n\nSo, the plan is this:\n\n1.  **Input Parsing:** Get `n`, `A`, and `B`, and calculate `m` and `k`.\n2.  **GCD & LCM Calculation:** Determine the cycle length (`cycle_len = lcm(m, k)`).\n3.  **Simulate One Cycle:**  This is the core of the algorithm. I'll simulate `cycle_len` rounds, keeping track of how many times each player loses within that cycle. I'll need a helper function, `get_winner`, to determine the outcome of each round ('R' beats 'S', 'S' beats 'P', 'P' beats 'R').\n4.  **Extrapolation:** Now, since we know the losses in one cycle, we can extrapolate for the `n` rounds.  We calculate how many full cycles fit into `n` and multiply the cycle losses by this number.\n5.  **Handle Remainders:** There might be remaining rounds less than a full cycle. So, I will simulate those rounds separately and add their losses to the totals.\n6.  **Output:** Finally, I'll print the total number of losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nSince the constraints are `n <= 2 * 10^9` and `m, k <= 1000`, the cycle length will be at most `10^6`, and the simulation part (in steps 3 and 5) will be efficient.  This should be a fast, correct, and elegant solution. I'll use Python, using `sys.stdin.readline` for faster input and `math.gcd` for calculating the GCD. The time complexity of this solution should be O(m\\*k). I have also included a walkthrough to check for edge cases and ensure the logic is correct.\n\nI believe this is a robust and efficient solution for the Rock-Paper-Scissors problem with cyclic strategies.\n",
