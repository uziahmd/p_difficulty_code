Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. We've got this \"Guard Duty\" problem. It's asking if we can perfectly match rebel spaceships to bases without their connecting paths crossing. The input gives us the number of ships and bases (which must be equal for a perfect match) and their coordinates.  The constraint that no three points are collinear is key; it'll simplify the intersection check a lot.\n\nSince the number of ships and bases is small (up to 10), I figure we can brute-force it with permutations. We can try every possible way to assign bases to ships. For each matching, we check if any of the connecting segments intersect. If we find a matching with no intersections, we're done; it's \"Yes\". If we try all the permutations and none work, it's \"No\".\n\nNow, the core of this is the intersection check.  Two line segments intersect if and only if each segment's endpoints are on opposite sides of the other segment's line. The orientation test (cross product) is the perfect tool for this. It tells us which side of a line a point lies on.  Since we are guaranteed no three points are collinear, we can simplify this orientation function to directly compare signs.  The collinearity constraint being removed is what allows a direct comparison to determine if we are facing the same side or opposite.\n\nSo, I'll write a function that calculates the orientation, and then use that in another function to check if two segments intersect.  The main part of the program will handle reading the input, generating the permutations, and checking each matching for intersections. The permutation code is trivial using Python's `permutations`. The efficiency bottleneck is the permutation loop, which has `R!` complexity. For R = 10, the runtime is roughly  `10! = 3.6 Million` segments, for each permutation segment pair intersections are computed at most `45` times, so `4*` more `do_intersect` operations, where the bottleneck is the `orientation` test that is done for each line segment to compare. This is feasible for the time limit, especially since we can stop as soon as we find a valid matching.\n\nI'll optimize things a little by avoiding redundant intersection checks (checking segment A-B with C-D is the same as C-D with A-B).  I'll also keep the coordinate data structures simple – lists of tuples should be fine.  I'm confident this approach will work, and it's straightforward to implement. Let's get coding.\n",
