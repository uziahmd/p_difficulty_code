Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts:** I need a Python script to check if a grid forms an \"X\" pattern. The grid is `n x n`, `n` is odd, between 3 and 299. Diagonals must have the same letter, non-diagonals must have a different single letter.\n\n**Reading Input:** First, read `n`. Then read the grid into a 2D list.\n\n**Setting Up Variables:** Initialize `diag_char` and `other_char` to store characters, initially empty strings. These will store the diagonal and non-diagonal characters, respectively.\n\n**The Main Loop:** Iterate through the grid row by row, column by column. For each cell:\n\n*   **Check Diagonal:** Determine if the cell is on a diagonal (`i == j` or `i + j == n - 1`).\n    *   If it's a diagonal: If `diag_char` is unset, assign it the current cell's character. If it's already set, ensure it matches the current cell. If not, the grid's invalid, so print \"NO\" and stop the process.\n*   **Check Non-Diagonal:** If the cell's not a diagonal: If `other_char` is unset, assign the current cell's char. If it's set, check for a match. If not, invalid, print \"NO\", exit.\n\n**Final Check:** After checking all cells, *only if* all checks passed in the loop*,* check if `diag_char` and `other_char` are different.  If they're equal, it's not an \"X,\" print \"NO\". Otherwise, it is an \"X,\" print \"YES\".\n\n**Optimization:** Implemented early exit using `return` within loops to stop checking once the condition is violated. This makes the code more efficient.\n\nThe loop structure is now `O(N^2)` for time and space.\n\n**Testing:**\n\nI tested it with various sample inputs to verify that it correctly identifies valid and invalid grids.\n\nThe strategy accounts for edge cases where the grid dimensions are odd, guaranteeing at least one character in the diagonals and non-diagonals. The logic relies on characters being checked only once against the pre-set diagonal and non-diagonal chars. This avoids any redundant re-comparisons.\n\nThe implementation handles the input and output requirements. It reads from stdin, writes to stdout, and addresses the problem's criteria, including the \"no explanation\" constraint by removing all comments, fulfilling the task requirements.\n",
