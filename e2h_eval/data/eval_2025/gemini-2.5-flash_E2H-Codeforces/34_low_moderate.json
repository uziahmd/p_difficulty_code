And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Calculating Average Sleep Time Over Weeks**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this problem, and it's asking for the average sleep time over a series of \"weeks.\"  Each \"week\" is a consecutive block of `k` days within a larger set of `n` sleep time records.  My first instinct is to break this down logically.\n\nI've got `n` data points, `a1` through `an`.  I need to figure out how many weeks there are.  Well, since a week is `k` days long, and I'm moving it one day at a time, there are `n - k + 1` possible weeks. Makes sense.\n\nNow, for each week, I need the total sleep time.  Let's call that `S_i` for the i-th week. So, `S_1` is the sum of the first `k` days, `S_2` is the sum of days 2 through `k+1`, and so on, up to `S_{n-k+1}` which is the sum from `an-k+1` to `an`.\n\nTo get the *average*, I need the sum of all these weekly sums, which I'll call `TotalSumOfWeeklySums`. And then, I simply divide that sum by the number of weeks, which is `n - k + 1`. The answer is `TotalSumOfWeeklySums / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nBut, I can see a pattern here.  When I expand `TotalSumOfWeeklySums`, I see that each data point `a_i` isn't just used once. It contributes to multiple weekly sums. For instance, `a_1` is only in the first week, but `a_2` is in the first and second, `a_3` is in the first, second, and third if k > 3.  I need to figure out *how many times* each `a_i` appears in this total sum.  It's like an overlapping sliding window.\n\nLet's look more closely. If I have `a_j`, it's part of `S_i` if the week starts at or before `j` and ends at or after `j`.  The first start for a week that includes `a_j` is `j - k + 1`, assuming that is greater than or equal to 1. The last week that contains `a_j` is up to `j` if `j` is less than or equal to the total length of the record. That means `a_j` contributes to weeks starting from `max(1, j - k + 1)` up to `min(n - k + 1, j)`.\n\nI can visualize this. For `k=3`:\n*   `a_1` appears only once\n*   `a_2` appears twice\n*   `a_3` appears three times\n*   `a_4` appears three times\n*   etc.\n\nSo, for any `j` value, I'm summing all weekly sums it is part of. I need to sum the total sleep hours, where the weight of each term depends on how many times that day is included in the weekly windows, and divide by the number of total windows. That's a good approach to think about. I think I have a way to calculate this more efficiently than by summing the individual weekly sums.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\". A week is defined as `k` consecutive days. Given `n` days of sleep records `a1, a2, ..., an`, there are `n - k + 1` such weeks.\n\nLet's denote the sum of sleep times for the `i`-th week (which includes days `ai, ai+1, ..., ai+k-1`) as `W_i`.\nThe first week covers `a1, ..., ak`.\nThe second week covers `a2, ..., ak+1`.\n...\nThe last week covers `a_{n-k+1}, ..., an`.\n\nWe need to calculate the sum of all `W_i` values and then divide by the total number of weeks, which is `n - k + 1`.\n\nA naive approach would be to:\n1. Iterate from `i = 1` to `n - k + 1`.\n2. For each `i`, calculate `W_i = a_i + a_{i+1} + ... + a_{i+k-1}`.\n3. Add `W_i` to a running total.\n4. Finally, divide the running total by `n - k + 1`.\n\nCalculating each `W_i` by summing `k` elements takes `O(k)` time. Since there are `n - k + 1` weeks, this approach would take `O((n - k + 1) * k)` time. Given `n` up to `2 * 10^5`, if `k` is also large (e.g., `k = n/2`), this could be `O(n^2)`, which is too slow (`(2 * 10^5)^2 = 4 * 10^{10}` operations).\n\nA more efficient approach involves using a sliding window sum or prefix sums.\nLet `P[j]` be the prefix sum `a1 + a2 + ... + aj`. `P[0] = 0`.\nThen `W_i = a_i + ... + a_{i+k-1}` can be calculated as `P[i+k-1] - P[i-1]` in `O(1)` time after `O(n)` preprocessing for prefix sums.\nThis would reduce the total time to `O(n)` for prefix sums + `O(n)` for calculating all `W_i`s and summing them, resulting in `O(n)` overall. This is efficient enough.\n\nHowever, we can simplify the calculation even further. Consider the total sum `S = W_1 + W_2 + ... + W_{n-k+1}`.\nLet's analyze how many times each `a_j` contributes to this total sum `S`.\n- `a_1` is only part of `W_1`. It appears 1 time.\n- `a_2` is part of `W_1` and `W_2`. It appears 2 times.\n- ...\n- `a_k` is part of `W_1, W_2, ..., W_k`. It appears `k` times.\n- `a_{k+1}` is part of `W_2, W_3, ..., W_{k+1}`. It appears `k` times.\n- ...\n- `a_j` (for `k <= j <= n-k+1`) is part of `W_{j-k+1}, ..., W_j`. It appears `k` times.\n- ...\n- `a_{n-1}` is part of `W_{n-k}, ..., W_{n-1}`. It appears `k - ( (n-1) - (n-k) ) = k - (k-1) = 1` time. No, this logic is incorrect.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the contribution of `a_j` to the total sum `S`.\nAn element `a_j` (where `1 <= j <= n`) contributes to `W_i` if `i <= j <= i+k-1`. This means `j-k+1 <= i <= j`.\nAlso, `i` must be a valid week start index, so `1 <= i <= n-k+1`.\nThus, `a_j` contributes to `W_i` for `i` in the range `[max(1, j-k+1), min(n-k+1, j)]`.\nThe number of times `a_j` contributes to `S` is `min(n-k+1, j) - max(1, j-k+1) + 1`.\n\nLet's check this count for different ranges of `j`:\n1. For `1 <= j < k`: `max(1, j-k+1)` is `1` (since `j-k+1 <= 0`). `min(n-k+1, j)` is `j`.\n   So `a_j` appears `j - 1 + 1 = j` times.\n2. For `k <= j <= n-k+1`: `max(1, j-k+1)` is `j-k+1`. `min(n-k+1, j)` is `j`.\n   So `a_j` appears `j - (j-k+1) + 1 = k` times.\n3. For `n-k+1 < j <= n`: `max(1, j-k+1)` is `j-k+1`. `min(n-k+1, j)` is `n-k+1`.\n   So `a_j` appears `(n-k+1) - (j-k+1) + 1 = n-j+1` times.\n\nSo, the total sum `S` can be calculated as:\n`S = sum_{j=1}^{k-1} (j * a_j) + sum_{j=k}^{n-k+1} (k * a_j) + sum_{j=n-k+2}^{n} ((n-j+1) * a_j)`\n\nThis formula is correct and calculates the total sum `S` in `O(n)` time.\nThe final average is `S / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nLet's illustrate with an example: `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`\nNumber of weeks = `n - k + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\nWeeks are:\n`W_1 = a_1 + a_2 = 3 + 4 = 7`\n`W_2 = a_2 + a_3 = 4 + 7 = 11`\nTotal sum `S = W_1 + W_2 = 7 + 11 = 18`.\nAverage = `18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n\nUsing the formula:\n`k-1 = 1`. `n-k+1 = 2`. `n-k+2 = 3`.\n`j=1`: `1 * a_1 = 1 * 3 = 3`\n`j=2`: `k * a_2 = 2 * 4 = 8`\n`j=3`: `(n-j+1) * a_3 = (3-3+1) * 7 = 1 * 7 = 7`\nTotal sum `S = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18`.\nAverage = `18 / 2 = 9.0`. The formula works.\n\nThis approach is `O(n)` and involves a single pass to calculate the weighted sum.\nThe sum can be large, up to `n * k * max(a_i) = 2*10^5 * 2*10^5 * 10^5 = 4 * 10^{15}`. This fits within a standard 64-bit integer type (like Python's arbitrary precision integers). The result should be a float.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    total_sum_of_weekly_sums = 0\n\n    # Calculate the sum of elements in the first window of size k\n    current_window_sum = sum(a[i] for i in range(k))\n    total_sum_of_weekly_sums += current_window_sum\n\n    # Use a sliding window to calculate sums for subsequent windows\n    # and add them to the total sum.\n    # The loop runs for n - k times, generating n - k + 1 total windows.\n    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n        # To get the sum of window [i, i+k-1] from window [i-1, i+k-2]:\n        # subtract a[i-1] and add a[i+k-1]\n        current_window_sum = current_window_sum - a[i-1] + a[i+k-1]\n        total_sum_of_weekly_sums += current_window_sum\n    \n    # The number of weeks is n - k + 1\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n    \n    # Calculate the average\n    average = total_sum_of_weekly_sums / num_weeks\n    \n    # Output with sufficient precision\n    print(f\"{average:.10f}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
