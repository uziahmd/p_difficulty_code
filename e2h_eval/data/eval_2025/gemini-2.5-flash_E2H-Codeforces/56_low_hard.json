            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Guard Duty: My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem. First things first:  the problem description spells out the core issue. I've got Rebel spaceships (R) and bases (B), and I need to pair them up.  The most important thing I picked up immediately is that `R` has to equal `B`. No match, no solution. Simple enough.\n\nGiven that's true, I need to figure out how to arrange the pairings. Each pair gets a line connecting a spaceship and a base. The crux is that these lines can't cross. Thinking about this, I see that the problem constraints are helpful, especially the small size of R and B. With `R` and `B` capped at 10, the idea of checking every single possible pairing – every permutation – comes to mind. Factorial is still a good range for brute force.\n\nNow, how do I check if lines intersect? This is where computational geometry knowledge kicks in. I need to use line segment intersection.  I'm thinking cross products will be perfect. I've used this before.  The check needs to be efficient.\n\nI know that to check if two line segments (let's say AB and CD) intersect, I need to confirm that A and B lie on opposite sides of the line CD, AND that C and D are on opposite sides of the line AB.  The cross product gives me that information: the sign of the cross product tells me what side a point is on relative to a line.  The problem's condition of no three collinear points saves me some headache, as I don't need to consider any 'on the line' cases.\n\nSo, I think my solution plan will be this:\n\n1.  **Check `R == B`**. If not, \"No\".\n2.  **Generate all permutations:** Create a list of all possible pairings (spaceship to base).\n3.  **For each permutation:**\n    *   Iterate through each pairing.\n    *   For each pair, check if it intersects any of the other pairings' line segments.\n    *   Use cross products for the intersection check.\n    *   If no intersections are found, this is a valid solution (\"Yes\").\n4.  **If no permutation works, return \"No\".**\n\nThis should be a practical and efficient approach, given the input constraints. I'm ready to write some Python!\n",
