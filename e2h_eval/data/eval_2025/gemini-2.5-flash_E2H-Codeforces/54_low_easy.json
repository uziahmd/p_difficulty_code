Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this coding challenge. The core is finding three vertices on a regular n-gon that form an angle closest to a target angle 'a'. It's all geometry, which I enjoy.\n\nFirst, I'm breaking down the geometric aspects. Regular polygons have some convenient properties. I immediately think of the central angle (360/n) and the Inscribed Angle Theorem. A regular polygon's vertices lie on a circle, so the inscribed angle is half the central angle subtending the same arc.\n\nMy initial thought is to fix one vertex, v2, as a reference point. Let's make it vertex 2. Then, I can move v1 to vertex 1 and consider where v3 goes. Let's call v3 vertex 'k', which will range from 3 to n. The angle v1-v2-v3 is created by this arc. The number of sides spanned by this arc is k-1. Therefore, the angle is proportional to this value.\n\nThe central angle of the arc v1-v3 is (k-1) * (360/n). Using the inscribed angle theorem, the inscribed angle is half of this, leading to the formula (k-1) * (180/n).\n\nNow, the trick is to iterate through these possible 'k' values. I need to calculate the angle, find the absolute difference from the target angle 'a', and keep track of the minimum. I need to make sure I'm handling the cases where I've fixed v2 at different positions. Ultimately, I can consider rotations, but the fundamental calculation will remain the same because of the polygon's regularity. I'll need a way to translate and maintain index positioning.\n\nSo, in essence, I'm looking at a problem where a clever formula based on regular polygon geometry simplifies the problem to an iterative search. It's about efficiently iterating through possible angles and minimizing the error. I will have a solution shortly.\n",
