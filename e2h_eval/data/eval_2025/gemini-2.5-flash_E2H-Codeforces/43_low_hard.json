He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing String Formation Rules**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about this string validation problem. The goal is to write a Python script that can determine if a given string `S` adheres to a specific set of formation rules. Let's break down these rules to clearly understand what constitutes a valid string.\n\nThe string formation follows a three-step process: 'a', 'b', then 'c'. First, we have some number of 'a's (let's call that `count_a`). Then, we append a number of 'b's (`count_b`). Finally, we attach a number of 'c's (`count_c`).\n\nThere are a few key constraints that must hold true. First, both `count_a` and `count_b` must be at least 1. We must start and have 'a' and 'b' present. Secondly, the number of 'c's (`count_c`) has to be equal to either the number of 'a's (`count_a`) OR the number of 'b's (`count_b`). It could potentially be equal to both.\n\nThis means a valid string has a fixed structure: it has to be a sequence of 'a's, followed by a sequence of 'b's, followed by a sequence of 'c's, in that order, without any deviations. No mixing or out-of-order characters. So, strings like \"aaabbc\" are good, but \"aba\" or \"aaacb\" aren't.\n\nIf we analyze a valid string `S`, it'll have the form `a...ab...bc...c`.\n\nTo check if a string is valid, I think I need to iterate through it and count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' while also verifying the order. The length of the string is given by `N`.\n\nMy initial approach is to locate the end of the 'a's. I'll iterate from the start of the string until I encounter a character that isn't 'a'. This index can represent how many 'a's the string has. So, if the index of the last 'a' is `idx_a_end`, then the total number of 'a's is `count_a = idx_a_end`. A few edge cases arise: if `idx_a_end` is zero, there are no initial 'a's, which automatically invalidates the string. If `idx_a_end` equals the string's length, the string only contains 'a's, and the other conditions aren't satisfied, which also results in an invalid string.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed according to a specific set of rules. Let's break down these rules and how they translate into conditions on the string `S`.\n\nThe string `S` is formed in three steps:\n\n1.  **A's step**: A starts with some number of 'a's. Let this count be `count_a`. The string is `a...a`.\n2.  **B's step**: B appends some number of 'b's to the end. Let this count be `count_b`. The string becomes `a...ab...b`.\n    *   **Constraint**: At this point, there must be at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. This means `count_a >= 1` and `count_b >= 1`.\n3.  **C's step**: C appends some number of 'c's to the end. Let this count be `count_c`. The string becomes `a...ab...bc...c`.\n    *   **Constraint**: `count_c` must be equal to `count_a` OR `count_c` must be equal to `count_b`. It can also be equal to both.\n\nCombining these rules, a valid string `S` must satisfy the following properties:\n\n1.  **Order of characters**: The string must consist of a contiguous block of 'a's, followed by a contiguous block of 'b's, followed by a contiguous block of 'c's. Any other order (e.g., `aba`, `acb`, `bca`) is invalid.\n2.  **Minimum counts**:\n    *   `count_a >= 1` (from B's step constraint).\n    *   `count_b >= 1` (from B's step constraint).\n    *   `count_c >= 1` (because `count_c` must equal `count_a` or `count_b`, and both are at least 1).\n3.  **Final count constraint**: `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`.\n\nWe can implement this check by iterating through the string and counting the characters while simultaneously verifying their order.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Initialize `count_a`, `count_b`, `count_c` to 0.\n2.  Initialize an index `i = 0` to traverse the string `S`.\n3.  **Count 'a's**: While `i < len(S)` and `S[i]` is 'a', increment `count_a` and `i`.\n4.  **Count 'b's**: While `i < len(S)` and `S[i]` is 'b', increment `count_b` and `i`.\n5.  **Count 'c's**: While `i < len(S)` and `S[i]` is 'c', increment `count_c` and `i`.\n6.  **Check remaining characters**: After these loops, if `i` is not equal to `len(S)`, it means there were characters other than 'a', 'b', or 'c' in the expected sequence (e.g., `aabc**a**`) or characters in the wrong order (e.g., `ab**a**c`). In this case, the string is invalid.\n7.  **Apply constraints**:\n    *   Check `count_a >= 1`.\n    *   Check `count_b >= 1`.\n    *   Check `count_c >= 1`.\n    *   Check `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`.\n\n    If all these conditions are met, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (S = \"aaabccc\"):**\n\n1.  `count_a=0, count_b=0, count_c=0, i=0`\n2.  **Count 'a's**:\n    *   `S[0]` is 'a', `count_a=1, i=1`\n    *   `S[1]` is 'a', `count_a=2, i=2`\n    *   `S[2]` is 'a', `count_a=3, i=3`\n    *   `S[3]` is 'b', loop ends.\n    `count_a = 3`.\n3.  **Count 'b's**:\n    *   `S[3]` is 'b', `count_b=1, i=4`\n    *   `S[4]` is 'c', loop ends.\n    `count_b = 1`.\n4.  **Count 'c's**:\n    *   `S[4]` is 'c', `count_c=1, i=5`\n    *   `S[5]` is 'c', `count_c=2, i=6`\n    *   `S[6]` is 'c', `count_c=3, i=7`\n    *   `i=7` is `len(S)`, loop ends.\n    `count_c = 3`.\n5.  **Check remaining characters**: `i` (7) is equal to `len(S)` (7). Order is correct.\n6.  **Apply constraints**:\n    *   `count_a = 3 >= 1` (True)\n    *   `count_b = 1 >= 1` (True)\n    *   `count_c = 3 >= 1` (True)\n    *   `count_c == count_a` (3 == 3, True) OR `count_c == count_b` (3 == 1, False). Since one is true, the OR condition is true.\n\nAll conditions are met. Print \"YES\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (S = \"bbacc\"):**\n\n1.  `count_a=0, count_b=0, count_c=0, i=0`\n2.  **Count 'a's**: `S[0]` is 'b', loop ends immediately.\n    `count_a = 0`.\n3.  **Count 'b's**:\n    *   `S[0]` is 'b', `count_b=1, i=1`\n    *   `S[1]` is 'b', `count_b=2, i=2`\n    *   `S[2]` is 'a', loop ends.\n    `count_b = 2`.\n4.  **Count 'c's**: `S[2]` is 'a', loop ends immediately.\n    `count_c = 0`.\n5.  **Check remaining characters**: `i` (2) is NOT equal to `len(S)` (5). The string has 'a' and 'c' after 'b's, which violates the order.\n    Although the problem statement for the second example says \"although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct\", our algorithm correctly identifies the order issue first.\n    The string is invalid. Print \"NO\".\n\nThe maximum length of `S` is 5,000. A single pass through the string is `O(N)` time complexity, which is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    n = len(S)\n    \n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    count_c = 0\n    \n    i = 0\n    \n    # Count 'a's\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'a':\n        count_a += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Count 'b's\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'b':\n        count_b += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Count 'c's\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'c':\n        count_c += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    # Check if there are any remaining characters or characters out of order\n    # If i < n, it means there were characters after the expected 'a's, 'b's, 'c's sequence\n    # or characters in the wrong order (e.g., 'abac').\n    if i < n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Apply the constraints\n    # 1.
