After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Python Script for \"Marks\" Problem: A Detailed Walkthrough**\n\nOkay, so I need to whip up a Python script to solve this \"Marks\" problem.  Let's break it down methodically. First things first:  I need to understand the problem constraints. I see `n` students, `m` subjects, marks from 1 to 9.  A \"successful\" student is one who's the best in at least one subject. Alright, straightforward enough.\n\nThe input is given as `n`, `m`, followed by `n` lines, each representing a student's marks in `m` subjects.  The output is a single integer: the count of successful students.\n\nI'm thinking of an algorithm:\n\n1.  Read `n` and `m` (easy, `input().split()` and `map(int...)`).\n2.  Read the gradebook:  I'll use a list of lists (a 2D array) to store the marks, converting characters to integers as I read them.  `gradebook[student_index][subject_index]` will be the structure.\n3.  The core logic: Iterate through *each subject*. For each subject, I'll find the *maximum* mark.  Then, iterate through all the students and mark any student who got that maximum mark for that subject as \"successful.\" A boolean array, initialized to `False`, `is_successful[n]` seems perfect for this.\n4.  Finally, iterate through the `is_successful` array and count the `True` values, which are the successful students.\n\nI'll read in the input, `n, m`, and initialize an empty gradebook and an array of False values. Then, the subject loop: I'll maintain `max_mark_in_subject`. I'll find the max within the subject and mark successful students. Finally, I'll sum the boolean array.\n\n* Time complexity: Reading input takes O(n * m).  Finding max mark per subject takes O(m * n). Marking successful students takes another O(m * n).  Counting is O(n). All in all it's O(n * m) - sounds reasonable, especially considering the small constraints (n, m <= 100).\n* Space complexity:  `gradebook` is O(n * m), `successful_students` is O(n).  So total space is also O(n * m), which should be within limits.\n\nI've tested the algorithm with examples, and it seems sound. Also confirmed against examples, including those where all students tie. The code is written and running; using `sys.stdin.readline()` and `strip()` is a good habit. Ready to submit!\n",
