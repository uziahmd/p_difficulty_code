Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a Character Counting Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem in front of me. The goal is to figure out if a pile of letters can be made by combining the letters from a guest's name and a host's name. Essentially, I need to check if the multiset of letters in the pile matches the multiset formed by combining the names.  This feels like a straightforward problem, focused on character frequencies.\n\nThe input is pretty standard: three strings â€“ the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters. All strings are uppercase and no longer than 100 characters each. The output should be \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nThe core logic is clear: I need to compare the combined character counts from the names to the counts in the pile.  I'm thinking, there are a few efficient ways to do this.\n\n**Method 1: Sorting**\n\nThe first approach that springs to mind is sorting. I can concatenate the guest and host names into a single string.  Then, I sort both this combined string and the pile of letters. If the sorted strings are identical, then the character counts are the same. This method is simple to implement and the constraints (max length of 100) make the sorting quite fast, O(N log N).\n\n**Method 2: Character Frequency Maps**\n\nThe second, and perhaps slightly more elegant, option is using character frequency maps (or arrays). Since we're dealing with only uppercase Latin letters (A-Z), I can create an array of size 26, where each index represents a letter. I'd initialize the array to all zeros. Then, I'd iterate through the guest's name and host's name, incrementing the count for each character in my frequency array.  I'd do the same for the pile of letters, building a second frequency array. Finally, I'd compare the two frequency arrays. If all the counts match, I'd output \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\". This is O(N) where N is the total number of characters, which should be even more efficient.\n\n**Choosing the Best Approach**\n\nBoth approaches are valid and efficient given the size constraints of the input. Both will produce a correct answer, and the runtime will be fast enough to avoid any time limits. Sorting is often a quick and dirty way to do it.\n\nGiven the potential efficiency of O(N) frequency counting with this restricted alphabet, I think I'll lean towards the frequency mapping method. It's a clean and effective way to manage character counts.\n",
