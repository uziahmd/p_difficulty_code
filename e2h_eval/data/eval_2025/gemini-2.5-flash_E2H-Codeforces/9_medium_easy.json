Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI need to come up with a Python script for the \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, which is a variation of the knapsack problem. Given `n` souvenirs, each having a `weight` (`w_i`) and a `cost` (`c_i`), I have to pick a subset of them whose total weight doesn't exceed `m`, maximizing the total cost.\n\nThe constraints are `1 <= n <= 100000`, `1 <= m <= 300000`, `1 <= w_i <= 3`, and `1 <= c_i <= 10^9`. The small weight constraint (`w_i <= 3`) is crucial. This suggests grouping items by weight. I'll store items with weight 1, 2, and 3 in separate lists (`items_w1`, `items_w2`, `items_w3`). I'll sort the costs in descending order within each list, maximizing the total cost.\n\nSince `m` can be up to `300000`, a standard `O(n*m)` knapsack solution would be too slow. However, the small weights provide an advantage. I'll think about combinations of items and how to optimize.\n\nLet's say `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are the numbers of items I pick from `items_w1`, `items_w2`, and `items_w3`. I need to maximize `sum(items_w1[:k1]) + sum(items_w2[:k2]) + sum(items_w3[:k3])`, ensuring that `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 + k3 * 3 <= m`.\n\nMy initial thought is to iterate through the possible values of `k3`, which range from `0` to `min(len(items_w3), m // 3)`. For each `k3`, calculate the cost from `items_w3[:k3]`. Then, the remaining capacity (`remaining_m`) is `m - k3 * 3`. I need to solve a subproblem: fill `remaining_m` using items with weight 1 and 2.\n\nThis subproblem also resembles the knapsack but uses weight 1 and 2 items. I can iterate through the number of weight-2 items, `k2`. Its range is from `0` to `min(len(items_w2), remaining_m // 2)`. Calculate the cost, update `remaining_m`, take the maximum items from weight 1, and so on.\n\nThe nested loop approach results in `O(m^2)` complexity, which is not efficient enough. `m = 300000`. I have to find a better approach.\n\nLet's fix `k3`. The problem then is to maximize `sum(items_w1[:k1]) + sum(items_w2[:k2])` such that `k1 + 2 * k2 <= m - 3*k3`. I'll use prefix sums to optimize this subproblem. Compute `prefix_sum_w1` and `prefix_sum_w2` in `O(n)` time. For each fixed `k3`, I'll iterate through `k2` and calculate `k1` as `min(len(items_w1), remaining_capacity - 2*k2)`. Now I have `O(m)` iterations, and thus `O(m^2)` complexity in total, still too slow.\n\nThe crucial idea is how to maximize a cost with both items of weight 1 and 2.\nI'll iterate `k2`. Fix `k2` items of weight 2. Remaining capacity becomes `remaining_m`. The maximum number of weight 1 items will be the minimum of the remaining capacity and `len(items_w1)`. `O(C)` time where `C = M - 3k3`, for each `k3`.\n\nThe core logic must use all the weights together. Let `f(C)` be the maximum cost for capacity `C` using only items with weights 1 and 2. We are interested in `f(M)`, `f(M - 3)`, `f(M - 6)`, etc. The total runtime will be approximately the sum of `f(C)`, meaning `O(M^2)`. It is too slow.\n\nLet's consider the dynamic programming way to use the prefix sums for efficiency.\nLet `dp[i]` be the maximum cost for capacity `i`.\n`dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + item with weight 1, dp[i",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs with a total weight not exceeding `m` and a maximum possible total cost. We are given `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `w_i` and cost `c_i`. The key constraints are `n <= 100000`, `m <= 300000`, and most importantly, `w_i` can only be `1, 2,` or `3`.\n\nThis is a variation of the knapsack problem. Since `n` and `m` are large, a standard `O(n*m)` dynamic programming solution is too slow. The small range of weights (`1, 2, 3`) is a strong hint for a more specialized solution.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Categorize and Sort:** Separate the souvenirs into three lists based on their weights: `items_w1`, `items_w2`, and `items_w3`. For each list, sort the costs in descending order. This ensures that when we pick items, we always take the most expensive ones first.\n    Precompute prefix sums for these sorted cost lists. `prefix_sum_wX[k]` will store the sum of the `k` most expensive items of weight `X`. This allows us to get the cost of `k` items in `O(1)` time.\n\n2.  **Iterate on Weight 3 Items:** The maximum number of items of weight 3 we can take is `m/3`. Let's iterate through all possible counts `k3` for items of weight 3, from `0` up to `min(len(items_w3), m // 3)`.\n    For each `k3`:\n    *   Calculate the cost contributed by `k3` items of weight 3: `cost_w3 = prefix_sum_w3[k3]`.\n    *   Calculate the remaining capacity: `remaining_m = m - k3 * 3`.\n    *   Now, we need to fill `remaining_m` capacity using items of weight 1 and 2 to maximize their combined cost. Let this maximum cost be `f(remaining_m)`.\n    *   The total cost for this `k3` is `cost_w3 + f(remaining_m)`. We update our overall maximum cost with this value.\n\n3.  **Efficiently Solving for Weight 1 and 2 Items:** The challenge is to compute `f(C)` (max cost for capacity `C` using only weight 1 and 2 items) efficiently. A naive `O(C)` approach for each `k3` would lead to an `O(m^2)` total complexity, which is too slow.\n\n    We can optimize the calculation of `f(C)` using a two-pointer/sliding window approach.\n    Let `current_cost_w1_w2[C]` store `f(C)`.\n    We want to compute `f(C)` for `C` from `0` to `m` (or `m - k3 * 3`).\n    \n    Consider the problem of maximizing `prefix_sum_w1[k1] + prefix_sum_w2[k2]` subject to `k1 + 2*k2 <= C`.\n    We can iterate `k2` from `0` to `min(len(items_w2), C // 2)`. For each `k2`, the remaining capacity for weight 1 items is `C - 2*k2`. We take `k1 = min(len(items_w1), C - 2*k2)` items of weight 1.\n    \n    The key optimization for this part is to notice that as we iterate through `k2`, the `k1` value we can take is `C - 2*k2`. This `k1` value decreases as `k2` increases.\n    \n    Instead of iterating `k2` for each `C`, we can build up the `f(C)` values.\n    Let's combine items of weight 1 and 2. We can think of two types of \"weight-2\" items:\n    *   An actual item of weight 2, with cost `c_2`.\n    *   Two items of weight 1, with combined cost `c_1a + c_1b`.\n    \n    We can create a new list `combined_w2_items` by merging `items_w2` with pairs of `items_w1`.\n    For every two `w1` items (say, `c1_i` and `c1_{i+1}`), we can form a \"virtual\" item of weight 2 and cost `c1_i + c1_{i+1}`.\n    \n    Let `items_w2_effective` be a list containing:\n    *   All costs from `items_w2`.\n    *   Costs `items_w1[i] + items_w1[i+1]` for `i = 0, 2, 4, ...` (pairs of weight 1 items).\n    Sort `items_w2_effective` in descending order. Precompute its prefix sums.\n    \n    Now, for a given `remaining_m`:\n    We can take `k2_eff` items from `items_w2_effective`. This uses `2 * k2_eff` weight.\n    Remaining capacity: `remaining_m - 2 * k2_eff`.\n    This remaining capacity must be filled with single `w1` items (if `remaining_m` is odd and we used an even number of `w1` items in `k2_eff`, or if we just have one `w1` item left over).\n    \n    This approach is still tricky because `items_w1` can be used both as single items and as pairs.\n    \n    **The optimal approach for weights 1 and 2:**\n    Let's compute `dp_w1_w2[capacity]` = max cost for `capacity` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n    `dp_w1_w2` can be computed in `O(M)` time overall.\n    Initialize `dp_w1_w2` array of size `m+1` to all zeros.\n    \n    `k1_ptr = 0` (index for `items_w1`)\n    `k2_ptr = 0` (index for `items_w2`)\n    `current_cost = 0`\n    \n    For `c` from `1` to `m`:\n        `dp_w1_w2[c] = dp_w1_w2[c-1]` (option to not take any item for capacity `c`, or take a w1 item for capacity `c-1`)\n        \n        If `k1_ptr < len(items_w1)` and `items_w1[k1_ptr]` is better than (or equal to) taking a w2 item:\n            `dp_w1_w2[c] = max(dp_w1_w2[c], dp_w1_w2[c-1] + items_w1[k1_ptr])`\n            `k1_ptr += 1`\n        \n        If `c >= 2` and `k2_ptr < len(items_w2)` and taking a w2 item is better:\n            `dp_w1_w2[c] = max(dp_w1_w2[c], dp_w1_w2[c-2] + items_w2[k2_ptr])`\n            `k2_ptr += 1`\n            \n    This is essentially a greedy approach, but it needs to be careful. The standard DP for unbounded knapsack (or bounded with few items but large quantities) is:\n    `dp[c] = max(dp[c-w_i] + c_i)` for all item types.\n    \n    Given `w_i` are 1 and 2, we can do:\n    `dp[c] = dp[c-1] + items_w1[k1_used]` (if we take another w1 item)\n    `dp[c] = dp[c-2] + items_w2[k2_used]` (if we take another w2 item)\n    \n    This is not correct because `k1_used` and `k2_used` depend on how many items we have already taken for `dp[c-1]` or `dp[c-2]`.\n    \n    **The correct `O(M)` computation for `f(C)` (max cost for weight 1 and 2 items):**\n    \n    We iterate `k2` (number of weight 2 items) from `0` to `min(len(items_w2), m // 2)`.\n    For each `k2`:\n        `cost_from_w2 = prefix_sum_w2[k2]`\n        `remaining_capacity_for_w1 = C - 2 * k2`\n        `k1 = min(len(items_w1), remaining_capacity_for_w1)`\n        `cost_from_w1 = prefix_sum_w1[k1]`\n        `f(C) = max(f(C), cost_from_w1 + cost_from_w2)`\n    \n    This loop is `O(C)`. The total outer loop for `k3` is `O(M)`. So `O(M^2)` total. This is the problem.\n    \n    **The actual efficient `O(M)` solution for `f(C)` over a range of `C`s:**\n    \n    The values of `remaining_m` decrease by 3 in each step of the outer loop (`M, M-3, M-6, ..., 0`).\n    We need to compute `f(C)` for these specific `C` values.\n    \n    Let `max_cost_w1_w2[capacity]` be the maximum cost achievable using items of weight 1 and 2 for a given `capacity`.\n    We can compute this array `max_cost_w1_w2` for all capacities from `0` to `m` in `O(m + len(items_w1) + len(items_w2))` time using a two-pointer approach:\n    \n    `max_cost_w1_w2 = [0] * (m + 1)`\n    `current_cost_w1 = 0`\n    `k1_ptr = 0`\n    \n    `# Initialize max_cost_w1_w2 assuming only weight 1 items are taken`\n    `for c in range(1, m + 1):`\n        `if k1_ptr < len(items_w1):`\n            `current_cost_w1 += items_w1[k1_ptr]`\n            `k1_ptr += 1`\n        `max_cost_w1_w2[c] = current_cost_w1`\n    \n    `# Now, incorporate weight 2 items.

The inner `c` loop is tricky, but `k1_ptr` is monotonic. In total, the `while` loop for `k1_ptr` runs `O(len(items_w1))` times over all `k2` and `c` iterations. The outer `k2` loop runs `O(len(items_w2))` times. The inner `c` loop runs `O(M)` times. So, the total is `O(M * len(items_w2))`.
