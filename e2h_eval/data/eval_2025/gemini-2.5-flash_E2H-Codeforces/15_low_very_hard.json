They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Playoff Problem: My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Playoff\" problem. Seems straightforward at first glance, but there are some nuances. My goal is a Python script to find these \"winning integers,\" right? Let's break down my thinking.\n\nFirst, I need to fully understand the tournament setup. We have $2^n$ teams, each with a unique skill level. It's a single-elimination bracket, so the structure is fixed. There's a string 's' that dictates who wins each match based on skill level. If 's' has a '0', the lower skill wins; if it has a '1', the higher skill wins. My job is to figure out which skill levels *could* possibly win the whole thing, regardless of the initial team arrangement. That is, which team's skill can I guarantee will win.\n\nThe string 's' is the core here. It tells me the game outcomes phase-by-phase. If a team wins, it needs to be strategically placed in the bracket. A particular team, let's say skill X, needs to win all $n$ of their matches. The opponents are important, based on the string s. If s has a 0, skill X must be less than the opponent, so it will lose! Likewise, a 1 means it must be the higher of the two, meaning it will win.\n\nSo, for any skill X to win, it needs to defeat, in the rounds it plays, a number of opponents that are either higher or lower, depending on the 's'. If the string has, for instance, a sequence of 0's, it means the lower skilled team wins. That means if the team has skill X, its opponent in those phases need to have greater skills.\n\nI'm thinking this comes down to counting. The number of '0's and '1's in 's' will determine the possible winning skill ranges. $cnt_0$ gives the number of opponent skills that are higher than X. This means I need to make X smaller. $cnt_1$ is the number of skills which are lower, making X greater! So the placement of my skill, based on s, should take the number of times 0 and 1 occur. \nIf the number of 0s equals 3, I know the winner will be one of the top 3.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ (from $1$ to $2^n$) that can win a playoff tournament, given that we can choose any permutation $p$ of skill levels for the $2^n$ teams. The rules for winning a match depend on the phase: if $s_i = '0'$, the lower skill team wins in phase $i+1$; if $s_i = '1'$, the higher skill team wins.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $X$ to win the tournament. A winning team must play $n$ games and win all of them.\nLet $cnt_0$ be the number of '0's in the string $s$, and $cnt_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$. Note that $cnt_0 + cnt_1 = n$.\n\nConsider a team with skill $X$ that wins the tournament.\n1. In phases where $s_i = '0'$ (lower skill wins), $X$ must defeat an opponent with skill $O_j > X$. There are $cnt_0$ such phases. This means $X$ must be smaller than $cnt_0$ distinct skill values.\n2. In phases where $s_i = '1'$ (higher skill wins), $X$ must defeat an opponent with skill $O_j < X$. There are $cnt_1$ such phases. This means $X$ must be larger than $cnt_1$ distinct skill values.\n\nIn total, for $X$ to win, it must defeat $n$ different opponents. These $n$ opponents must have skill levels $O_1, \\ldots, O_n$ such that:\n- $cnt_0$ of these $O_j$ values are greater than $X$.\n- $cnt_1$ of these $O_j$ values are less than $X$.\n\nTo make it possible for $X$ to win, we need to ensure there are enough skill values available for these opponents.\nThe total number of skill values available is $2^n$.\nThe skill values used are $X$ itself, and the $n$ opponents $O_1, \\ldots, O_n$. All $n+1$ of these must be distinct.\n\nTo satisfy condition 1, $X$ must be able to find $cnt_0$ distinct skill values greater than $X$. The smallest $cnt_0$ values greater than $X$ are $X+1, X+2, \\ldots, X+cnt_0$. So, $X+cnt_0$ must be at most $2^n$. This implies $X \\le 2^n - cnt_0$.\nTo satisfy condition 2, $X$ must be able to find $cnt_1$ distinct skill values smaller than $X$. The largest $cnt_1$ values smaller than $X$ are $X-1, X-2, \\ldots, X-cnt_1$. So, $X-cnt_1$ must be at least $1$. This implies $X \\ge 1 + cnt_1$.\n\nCombining these, a skill $X$ can potentially win if and only if $1 + cnt_1 \\le X \\le 2^n - cnt_0$.\n\nLet's verify if any $X$ in this range can actually win.\nSuppose we pick an $X$ such that $1 + cnt_1 \\le X \\le 2^n - cnt_0$.\nWe need to construct a permutation $p$ such that $X$ wins.\nThe key insight is that we only need to assign skill values to $n+1$ specific positions: the position of the team with skill $X$, and the $n$ positions of its opponents. The remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ skill values can be assigned to the remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ team slots arbitrarily, as long as they don't interfere with $X$'s path.\nWe can always arrange the tournament bracket such that $X$ plays against its chosen opponents in the correct phases. For example, if $X$ is assigned to team slot 1, its first opponent is team 2. If $X$ wins, its second opponent is the winner of team 3 vs 4. We can assign the desired skill values to team 2, and to teams 3 and 4 such that the winner of their match has the desired skill for $X$'s second opponent, and so on. This is always possible because we have full control over the initial permutation $p$.\n\nSpecifically, we need to find $cnt_0$ values greater than $X$ and $cnt_1$ values less than $X$.\nWe can choose the $cnt_0$ opponents with skills $X+1, X+2, \\ldots, X+cnt_0$.\nWe can choose the $cnt_1$ opponents with skills $X-1, X-2, \\ldots, X-cnt_1$.\nAll these $n$ values are distinct from $X$ and distinct from each other.\nThe smallest value among these $n$ opponents is $X-cnt_1$. Since $X \\ge 1+cnt_1$, $X-cnt_1 \\ge 1$.\nThe largest value among these $n$ opponents is $X+cnt_0$. Since $X \\le 2^n-cnt_0$, $X+cnt_0 \\le 2^n$.\nSo, all $n+1$ values ($X$ and its $n$ opponents) are within the range $[1, 2^n]$ and are distinct.\nTherefore, any $X$ satisfying $1 + cnt_1 \\le X \\le 2^n - cnt_0$ is a winning integer.\n\nThe problem asks for these integers in ascending order.\nThe range of winning integers is an inclusive interval $[1 + cnt_1, 2^n - cnt_0]$.\n\nLet's calculate $cnt_0$ and $cnt_1$ from the input string $s$.\n$cnt_0 = s.count('0')$\n$cnt_1 = s.count('1')$\n\nThe minimum winning skill is $min\\_X = 1 + cnt_1$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $max\\_X = 2^n - cnt_0$.\n\nWe need to print all integers from $min\\_X$ to $max\\_X$.\n\nExample 1: $n=3$, $s=\"101\"$\n$cnt_0 = 1$ (for '0' at index 1)\n$cnt_1 = 2$ (for '1' at indices 0 and 2)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\n$min\\_X = 1 + cnt_1 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n$max\\_X = 2^n - cnt_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nThe winning integers are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nWait, the example output is `4 5 6 7`. What went wrong?\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully: \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins; if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\nThe phases are indexed $1, \\ldots, n$. The string $s$ has length $n$. So $s_0$ corresponds to phase 1, $s_1$ to phase 2, ..., $s_{n-1}$ to phase $n$.\nMy interpretation of $cnt_0$ and $cnt_1$ is correct.\n\nThe example output `4 5 6 7` for $n=3, s=\"101\"$ implies $min\\_X = 4$.\nMy formula gives $min\\_X = 1 + cnt_1 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\nThe difference is $2^n - (2^{cnt_0} - 1)$ vs $2^n - cnt_0$.\nThis hints that the \"number of available slots\" might not be just $cnt_0$ or $cnt_1$, but rather related to powers of 2.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the number of available skill values for opponents.\nConsider a team with skill $X$.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $X$ must be smaller than its opponent.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be larger than its opponent.\n\nWhat is the *minimum* skill value a team can have and still win?\nTo minimize $X$, we want $X$ to win against as many smaller skill opponents as possible. This means $s_i = '1'$ for many phases.\nThe team needs to defeat $cnt_1$ opponents with smaller skill values. The smallest possible skill values for these opponents are $1, 2, \\ldots, cnt_1$. So $X$ must be at least $cnt_1 + 1$.\nThe team needs to defeat $cnt_0$ opponents with larger skill values. The largest possible skill values for these opponents are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\ldots, 2^n-cnt_0+1$. So $X$ must be at most $2^n - cnt_0$.\n\nThis logic seems sound for the \"number of distinct skill values\" needed.\nHowever, the problem is about *tournament structure*. The path of a team is fixed in terms of which segment of the bracket it is in. For example, if a team is in slot 1:\n- Phase 1: plays team 2.\n- Phase 2: plays winner of (team 3 vs 4).\n- Phase 3: plays winner of (winner(1vs2) vs winner(3vs4)) vs (winner(5vs6) vs winner(7vs8)).\n\nThe issue might be that we don't have $n$ *independent* opponents. The opponents are winners of sub-tournaments.\nConsider the $cnt_1$ phases where $X$ must win by having a higher skill. Let these phases be $i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_{cnt_1}$.\nIn each such phase $i_k$, $X$ plays against an opponent $O_k$, and $X > O_k$.\nThe minimum skill value $X$ can have is $1 + (\\text{number of distinct values } X \\text{ must be greater than})$.\nThe number of distinct values $X$ must be greater than is $cnt_1$. So $X \\ge 1+cnt_1$.\n\nConsider the $cnt_0$ phases where $X$ must win by having a lower skill. Let these phases be $j_1, j_2, \\ldots, j_{cnt_0}$.\nIn each such phase $j_k$, $X$ plays against an opponent $O_k$, and $X < O_k$.\nThe maximum skill value $X$ can have is $2^n - (\\text{number of distinct values } X \\text{ must be smaller than})$.\nThe number of distinct values $X$ must be smaller than is $cnt_0$. So $X \\le 2^n - cnt_0$.\n\nThis reasoning is still the same. The example output suggests something else.\nLet's consider the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$cnt_0=1, cnt_1=2$.\nMy range: $[3, 7]$. Output: $[4, 7]$.\nThe difference is that $min\\_X$ is $4$ instead of $3$.\n\nLet's look at the structure of the tournament more closely.\nA team with skill $X$ wins.\nThe team plays $n$ games.\nIn phase $k$ (0-indexed $k=0 \\dots n-1$), $s_k$ determines the winner.\nIf $s_k = '0'$, $X$ must be smaller than its opponent $O_k$.\nIf $s_k = '1'$, $X$ must be larger than its opponent $O_k$.\n\nThe crucial part is that the opponents $O_k$ are not arbitrary teams from the initial $2^n$ teams. Each $O_k$ is itself a winner of a sub-tournament.\nFor $X$ to win by having a higher skill ($s_k = '1'$), its opponent $O_k$ must have a skill value less than $X$. But $O_k$ itself must have won a sub-tournament.\nThe sub-tournament $O_k$ comes from involves $2^{k}$ teams. $O_k$ must have defeated $k$ opponents itself.\nThis means $O_k$ must be a \"winning integer\" in its own sub-tournament, with its own specific set of $s$ values relevant for its path.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's simplify.\nWhat is the minimum number of teams that $X$ must be greater than to win?\nIt's $cnt_1$.\nWhat is the minimum number of teams that $X$ must be smaller than to win?\nIt's $cnt_0$.\n\nLet's consider the set of skills that $X$ must be greater than.\nIn $cnt_1$ phases, $X$ wins because $X > O_j$.\nEach opponent $O_j$ is the winner of a sub-tournament. The size of this sub-tournament varies depending on the phase $j$.\nIf $s_j = '1'$, $X$ must defeat $O_j$. $O_j$ comes from a bracket of size $2^j$.\nTo minimize $X$, we want $X$ to be greater than as few values as possible.\nThe $cnt_1$ opponents $O_j$ that $X$ defeats must have skill values less than $X$.\nThese $O_j$ values are not necessarily $1, 2, \\ldots, cnt_1$.\nEach $O_j$ itself must be a \"winning skill\" in its own sub-tournament.\nFor $O_j$ to win its sub-tournament, it needs to be greater than a certain number of teams, and smaller than a certain number of teams.\nThe number of teams in $O_j$'s sub-tournament is $2^j$. $O_j$ plays $j$ games.\nLet $s'$ be the relevant part of $s$ for $O_j$'s sub-tournament.\n\nThis is the wrong path. The problem states \"it is possible to find a permutation $p$\". We just need *one* such $p$.\nThis means we can assign skill values to all $2^n$ teams as we wish.\nThe minimum skill value a winner can have is when it wins all $cnt_1$ games by being higher, and all $cnt_0$ games by being lower.\nTo minimize $X$:\n- $X$ must be greater than $cnt_1$ opponents. The smallest values $X$ can be greater than are $1, 2, \\ldots, cnt_1$.\n- $X$ must be smaller than $cnt_0$ opponents. The largest values $X$ can be smaller than are $2^n, 2^n-1, \\ldots, 2^n-cnt_0+1$.\n\nThe crucial observation is the number of teams that *could* possibly reach the final $X$ plays against.\nIn phase $k$ ($0$-indexed, $s_k$), the winner of $X$'s current sub-bracket plays against the winner of an *adjacent* sub-bracket of the same size.\nEach such adjacent sub-bracket contains $2^k$ initial teams.\nSo, in phase $k$, $X$ plays against an opponent $O_k$ who is the winner of a sub-tournament of $2^k$ teams.\n\nLet's re-examine the example $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$s_0 = '1'$ (Phase 1, $2^{3-1}=4$ games): Higher skill wins.\n$s_1 = '0'$ (Phase 2, $2^{3-2}=2$ games): Lower skill wins.\n$s_2 = '1'$ (Phase 3, $2^{3-3}=1$ game): Higher skill wins.\n\nSuppose team $X$ wins.\nGame 1 (Phase 1, $s_0='1'$): $X$ plays $O_1$. $X > O_1$. $O_1$ is one of the $2^{3-1}=4$ initial teams.\nGame 2 (Phase 2, $s_1='0'$): $X$ plays $O_2$. $X < O_2$. $O_2$ is winner of a sub-tournament of $2^{3-2}=2$ teams.\nGame 3 (Phase 3, $s_2='1'$): $X$ plays $O_3$. $X > O_3$. $O_3$ is winner of a sub-tournament of $2^{3-3}=1$ team. This opponent is the winner of the other half of the bracket (a $2^{n-1}$ team sub-tournament).\n\nThis is still not quite right.\nThe $i$-th phase has $2^{n-i}$ games. $s_i$ refers to this phase.\nSo $s_0$ refers to phase 1 (round of $2^n$ teams to $2^{n-1}$ teams).\n$s_1$ refers to phase 2 (round of $2^{n-1}$ teams to $2^{n-2}$ teams).\n...\n$s_{n-1}$ refers to phase $n$ (round of $2^1$ teams to $2^0=1$ team, the final).\n\nLet $X$ be the skill of the winning team.\nIn phase $k+1$ (where $s_k$ applies), $X$ plays against an opponent $O_{k+1}$.\nIf $s_k = '0'$, $X < O_{k+1}$.\nIf $s_k = '1'$, $X > O_{k+1}$.\n\nThe crucial part is that $O_{k+1}$ is the winner of a sub-tournament that started with $2^k$ teams.\nFor $X$ to win, it must be assigned to one of the $2^n$ initial slots. We can assign $X$ to any slot, say slot 1.\nIts opponents will be:\n- Phase 1 ($s_0$): opponent $O_1$ (initially slot 2). $O_1$ is just an initial team.\n- Phase 2 ($s_1$): opponent $O_2$ (winner of slots 3 and 4). $O_2$ is winner of a $2^1$-team sub-tournament.\n- Phase 3 ($s_2$): opponent $O_3$ (winner of slots 5-8). $O_3$ is winner of a $2^2$-team sub-tournament.\n...\n- Phase $k+1$ ($s_k$): opponent $O_{k+1}$ (winner of a $2^k$-team sub-tournament).\n...\n- Phase $n$ ($s_{n-1}$): opponent $O_n$ (winner of a $2^{n-1}$-team sub-tournament).\n\nConsider the $cnt_1$ phases where $X$ must win by having a higher skill. Let these be phases $k_1+1, \\ldots, k_{cnt_1}+1$.\nFor each such phase $k_j+1$, $X$ must defeat $O_{k_j+1}$, and $X > O_{k_j+1}$.\n$O_{k_j+1}$ is the winner of a sub-tournament of $2^{k_j}$ teams.\nTo make $X$ win with minimal skill, we want $O_{k_j+1}$ to have the smallest possible skill.\nThe smallest possible skill for a winner of a $2^{k_j}$-team sub-tournament is $1$. This is possible if all $s$ values relevant for this sub-tournament make $1$ win.\nFor example, if $s_0=0, s_1=0, \\ldots, s_{k_j-1}=0$, then $1$ could win a $2^{k_j}$-team sub-tournament by always being the lower skill.\nIf $s_0=1, s_1=1, \\ldots, s_{k_j-1}=1$, then $2^{k_j}$ could win by always being the higher skill.\n\nThis problem is about the *number of teams* that are \"below\" or \"above\" $X$ in skill.\nLet $L$ be the set of indices $i$ where $s_i = '0'$ (lower skill wins).\nLet $H$ be the set of indices $i$ where $s_i = '1'$ (higher skill wins).\n$|L| = cnt_0$, $|H| = cnt_1$.\n\nFor $X$ to win, for each $i \\in L$, $X$ must be smaller than its opponent.\nFor each $i \\in H$, $X$ must be larger than its opponent.\n\nThe total number of teams $X$ must be greater than is $cnt_1$. These are the $cnt_1$ opponents $O_j$ from phases where $s_j = '1'$.\nEach such $O_j$ is the winner of a sub-tournament of $2^{j-1}$ teams.\nThe minimum skill $X$ can have is determined by how many teams it must be greater than.\nThis is not just $cnt_1$ teams.\nThe $cnt_1$ values $O_j$ are distinct from $X$.\nBut the $2^{j-1}$ teams that form $O_j$'s sub-tournament also have skill values.\nIf $X$ defeats $O_j$ (where $s_{j-1}='1'$), $X$ is greater than $O_j$.\nThe $2^{j-1}$ teams in $O_j$'s sub-tournament are distinct from $X$'s sub-tournament.\nSo, $X$ must be greater than $O_j$.\nAnd $O_j$ itself must be greater than $cnt_1'$ teams and smaller than $cnt_0'$ teams, where $cnt_0'$ and $cnt_1'$ are counts of '0' and '1' in $s_0 \\ldots s_{j-2}$.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying: if $s_k = '1'$, $X$ must be greater than $2^k$ initial teams (those in the opponent's sub-bracket).\nIf $s_k = '0'$, $X$ must be smaller than $2^k$ initial teams.\n\nNo, this is incorrect. $X$ only plays against $O_{k+1}$. $O_{k+1}$ is a single team.\nThe values $1, \\ldots, 2^n$ are skills. We can assign them to any initial team slots.\nLet $X$ be the skill of the winner.\nFor each $k \\in [0, n-1]$:\n- If $s_k = '1'$, $X$ must be greater than $O_{k+1}$. We can assign $O_{k+1}$ to be $1$.\n- If $s_k = '0'$, $X$ must be smaller than $O_{k+1}$. We can assign $O_{k+1}$ to be $2^n$.\n\nThis is the simplest interpretation. The $n$ opponents $O_1, \\ldots, O_n$ are just $n$ distinct skill values.\nIf $s_k = '1'$, $X > O_{k+1}$. We need $cnt_1$ such opponents. We can assign them values $1, 2, \\ldots, cnt_1$.\nIf $s_k = '0'$, $X < O_{k+1}$. We need $cnt_0$ such opponents. We can assign them values $2^n, 2^n-1, \\ldots, 2^n-cnt_0+1$.\nAll $n$ opponents must be distinct from $X$ and distinct from each other.\nThis implies $X \\ge 1 + cnt_1$ and $X \\le 2^n - cnt_0$.\nThis is the same range $[1+cnt_1, 2^n-cnt_0]$.\n\nLet's re-check the example again: $n=3$, $s=\"101\"$.\n$cnt_0=1, cnt_1=2$. Range $[1+2, 2^3-1] = [3, 7]$.\nOutput: `4 5 6 7`.\nMy range is $[3, 7]$. The output range is $[4, 7]$.\nIt seems my $min\\_X$ is off by 1. $min\\_X = 1 + (\\text{number of teams } X \\text{ must be greater than})$.\nThe number of teams $X$ must be greater than is $2^{cnt_1}$.\nNo, that's not it.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that \"don't matter\" for $X$ to win.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X$ wins by being higher. This means all teams in the sub-bracket that $X$ is playing against must have skill values less than $X$.\nThe opponent $O_{i+1}$ is the winner of a $2^i$-team sub-tournament.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $X > O_{i+1}$. To make this possible, we need to ensure $O_{i+1}$ can be chosen to be small.\nThe smallest possible winner of a $2^i$-team sub-tournament is $1$. This happens if all $i$ phases $s_0 \\ldots s_{i-1}$ for that sub-tournament are '0' (lower skill wins).\nThe largest possible winner of a $2^i$-team sub-tournament is $2^i$. This happens if all $i$ phases $s_0 \\ldots s_{i-1}$ for that sub-tournament are '1' (higher skill wins).\n\nThe problem is that the string $s$ applies to *all* games in a phase.\nSo, if $s_k = '1'$, *every* game in phase $k+1$ has the higher skill team winning.\nThis means the opponent $O_{k+1}$ (who won a $2^k$-team sub-tournament) must have won its games according to $s_0, \\ldots, s_{k-1}$.\nThis is the key. The $s$ string applies to all sub-tournaments.\n\nLet $f(k, s')$ be the minimum skill a team can have to win a $2^k$-team tournament with rules $s'$.\nLet $g(k, s')$ be the maximum skill a team can have to win a $2^k$-team tournament with rules $s'$.\n\nThe winning range for the whole tournament (size $2^n$, rules $s$) is $[min\\_win, max\\_win]$.\nTo find $min\\_win$:\nThe winner $X$ plays $n$ games.\nIn phase $i$ ($s_{i-1}$ rule): $X$ plays $O_i$. $O_i$ is winner of $2^{i-1}$ teams.\nIf $s_{i-1} = '1'$ ($X > O_i$): $O_i$ must be as small as possible. The smallest possible winner of a $2^{i-1}$-team sub-tournament is $1$. This is possible if we assign $1$ to one of the initial $2^{i-1}$ slots, and arrange the other skills such that $1$ wins its sub-tournament. This can be done by assigning skills $1, \\ldots, 2^{i-1}$ to the sub-tournament slots, and if $s_j='0'$ for $j<i-1$, $1$ wins. If $s_j='1'$ for $j<i-1$, $2^{i-1}$ wins.\nThis is still not correct. The rules $s_0, \\ldots, s_{i-2}$ apply to the sub-tournament that $O_i$ comes from.\n\nLet's count the number of teams that $X$ must be greater than.\nFor each $i$ such that $s_i = '1'$: $X$ must defeat an opponent $O_{i+1}$. $O_{i+1}$ is the winner of a $2^i$-team sub-tournament.\nTo minimize $X$, we want $O_{i+1}$ to be as small as possible.\nThe smallest possible winner of a $2^i$-team sub-tournament (with rules $s_0, \\ldots, s_{i-1}$) is $1$.\nThis means $X$ must be greater than $1$.\nThis happens for each $i$ where $s_i='1'$.\nThe opponents $O_{i+1}$ come from disjoint sub-brackets.\nSo, if $s_i = '1'$, $X$ must be greater than $O_{i+1}$.\nThe *number of skill values* that $X$ must be greater than is $1$ for each $s_i='1'$.\nSo $X \\ge 1 + (\\text{number of '1's in } s)$. This is $1+cnt_1$.\n\nThe problem is simpler:\nHow many skill values must be strictly less than $X$ for $X$ to win?\nThe answer is $2^{cnt_1}$.\nHow many skill values must be strictly greater than $X$ for $X$ to win?\nThe answer is $2^{cnt_0}$.\n\nLet's verify this.\nSuppose $X$ wins.\nFor each $i$ where $s_i = '1'$ (higher skill wins): $X$ must defeat an opponent $O_{i+1}$. $X > O_{i+1}$.\nThe opponent $O_{i+1}$ is the winner of a sub-tournament of $2^i$ teams.\nAll $2^i$ teams in $O_{i+1}$'s initial sub-bracket must have skills less than $X$.\nWhy? If any team in that $2^i$-team sub-bracket had skill $S > X$, then if $S$ won its sub-tournament, $O_{i+1}$ would be $S$, and $X$ couldn't win ($X < S$).\nIf $S$ didn't win its sub-tournament, then $O_{i+1}$ would be some other skill, say $S'$.\nThe crucial point is that we can *choose* the permutation $p$.\nSo, if $s_i = '1'$, we want to make all $2^i$ teams in $O_{i+1}$'s sub-bracket have skills less than $X$.\nThere are $cnt_1$ such phases. Each such phase corresponds to an opponent sub-bracket of size $2^i$.\nThe sizes $2^i$ are different for different $i$.\nFor $s_0='1'$, $X$ plays $O_1$. $O_1$ is an initial team. $X > O_1$.\nFor $s_1='1'$, $X$ plays $O_2$. $O_2$ is winner of $2^1=2$ teams. $X > O_2$.\nFor $s_2='1'$, $X$ plays $O_3$. $O_3$ is winner of $2^2=4$ teams. $X > O_3$.\nThe number of teams $X$ must be greater than is the sum of $2^i$ for all $i$ where $s_i='1'$.\nThis is $\\sum_{i \\text{ s.t. } s_i='1'} 2^i$. This sum is not $2^{cnt_1}$.\nExample $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$s_0='1'$, $s_1='0'$, $s_2='1'$.\n$cnt_1=2$. $i=0$ and $i=2$.\n$X$ must be greater than $O_1$ (from $2^0=1$ team) and $O_3$ (from $2^2=4$ teams).\n$O_1$ is just an initial team. We make $O_1 = 1$.\n$O_3$ is the winner of a 4-team sub-tournament. We want $O_3$ to be small.\nWe can make $O_3$ win by assigning $2,3,4,5$ to the 4 slots, and if $s_0=0, s_1=0$ for that sub-tournament, then $2$ could win.\nThe $s$ string is global.\nSo $O_3$ must win its 4-team sub-tournament according to $s_0, s_1$.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$:\n$X$ wins.\nPhase 1 ($s_0='1'$): $X > O_1$. $O_1$ is an initial team. We can assign $O_1=1$.\nPhase 2 ($s_1='0'$): $X < O_2$. $O_2$ is winner of a 2-team sub-tournament. $O_2$ wins according to $s_0='1'$. So $O_2$ is the higher skill of its initial pair.\nPhase 3 ($s_2='1'$): $X > O_3$. $O_3$ is winner of a 4-team sub-tournament. $O_3$ wins according to $s_0='1', s_1='0'$.\n\nLet's count how many teams $X$ must be greater than.\nFor $s_i='1'$, $X$ must be greater than $O_{i+1}$.\nTo minimize $X$, we want $O_{i+1}$ to be as small as possible.\nThe minimum skill value a team can achieve winning a $2^i$-team sub-tournament (with $s_0, \\ldots, s_{i-1}$ rules) is $1 + \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \\text{if } s_j='1' \\text{ then } 2^j \\text{ else } 0$. This is not quite right.\nThe minimum skill a team can win a $2^i$-team sub-tournament with rules $s_0, \\ldots, s_{i-1}$ is $1 + (\\text{number of '1's in } s_0 \\ldots s_{i-1})$. This is $1+cnt_1(i-1)$.\nThe maximum skill a team can win a $2^i$-team sub-tournament with rules $s_0, \\ldots, s_{i-1}$ is $2^i - (\\text{number of '0's in } s_0 \\ldots s_{i-1})$. This is $2^i - cnt_0(i-1)$.\n\nLet $min\\_possible[k]$ be the minimum skill that can win a $2^k$-team sub-tournament using $s_0, \\ldots, s_{k-1}$.\nLet $max\\_possible[k]$ be the maximum skill that can win a $2^k$-team sub-tournament using $s_0, \\ldots, s_{k-1}$.\n$min\\_possible[0] = 1$ (1 team, skill 1 wins). $max\\_possible[0] = 1$.\n\nFor $k > 0$:\nIf $s_{k-1} = '0'$ (lower skill wins in final of $2^k$ sub-tournament):\nThe winner $W$ beats $O$. $W < O$.\n$W$ is winner of $2^{k-1}$ teams, $O$ is winner of $2^{k-1}$ teams.\nTo minimize $W$: $W$ should be $min\\_possible[k-1]$. $O$ should be $max\\_possible[k-1]$. Then $W < O$.\nSo $min\\_possible[k] = min\\_possible[k-1]$.\nTo maximize $W$: $W$ should be $max\\_possible[k-1]$. $O$ should be $min\\_possible[k-1]$. Then $W < O$.\nSo $max\\_possible[k] = max\\_possible[k-1]$.\nThis is wrong. $W$ and $O$ come from disjoint sets of skills.\n\nLet's use the definition of $cnt_0$ and $cnt_1$ for the full string $s$.\nThe minimum skill $X$ can have is $1 + \\sum_{i \\text{ s.t. } s_i='1'} 2^i$.\nThe maximum skill $X$ can have is $2^n - \\sum_{i \\text{ s.t. } s_i='0'} 2^i$.\nThis is also incorrect. The $2^i$ values are the sizes of the sub-brackets, not the actual skill values.\n\nThe crucial observation comes from a similar problem:\nThe number of teams that a team with skill $X$ must be greater than is $2^{cnt_1} - 1$.\nThe number of teams that a team with skill $X$ must be smaller than is $2^{cnt_0} - 1$.\nThis is a common pattern in tournament problems.\nThe minimum skill $X$ can have is $1 + (2^{cnt_1} - 1) = 2^{cnt_1}$.\nThe maximum skill $X$ can have is $2^n - (2^{cnt_0} - 1)$.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$cnt_0=1, cnt_1=2$.\n$min\\_X = 2^{cnt_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\n$max\\_X = 2^n - (2^{cnt_0} - 1) = 2^3 - (2^1 - 1) = 8 - (2-1) = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nRange is $[4, 7]$. This matches the example output `4 5 6 7`.\n\nExample 2: $n=1, s=\"1\"$\n$cnt_0=0, cnt_1=1$.\n$min\\_X = 2^{cnt_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n$max\\_X = 2^n - (2^{cnt_0} - 1) = 2^1 - (2^0 - 1) = 2 - (1 - 1) = 2 - 0 = 2$.\nRange is $[2, 2]$. This matches the example output `2`.\n\nExample 3: $n=2, s=\"01\"$\n$cnt_0=1, cnt_1=1$.\n$min\\_X = 2^{cnt_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n$max\\_X = 2^n - (2^{cnt_0} - 1) = 2^2 - (2^1 - 1) = 4 - (2 - 1) = 4 - 1 = 3$.\nRange is $[2, 3]$. This matches the example output `2 3`.\n\nThis hypothesis seems to be correct for all examples.\n\nWhy is this the case?\nConsider the number of teams that must be placed in the tournament such that $X$ wins.\n$X$ is one team.\nFor each $i$ where $s_i='1'$, $X$ must defeat an opponent $O_{i+1}$. $X > O_{i+1}$.\nTo ensure $X > O_{i+1}$, we can assign all $2^i$ teams in $O_{i+1}$'s sub-bracket to have skills less than $X$.\nIf we do this for all $cnt_1$ phases where $s_i='1'$, then $X$ must be greater than $\\sum_{i \\text{ s.t. } s_i='1'} 2^i$ teams.\nThis sum is not $2^{cnt_1}-1$.\nThe $2^i$ are the sizes of the opponent's sub-tournament.\nIf $s_i='1'$, $X$ must win against $O_{i+1}$.\nTo be able to choose $O_{i+1}$ to be smaller than $X$, we must ensure that $O_{i+1}$ is indeed smaller than $X$.\nThe minimum skill value a team can have in a $2^k$-team sub-tournament is $1$. The maximum is $2^k$.\nIf $s_i='1'$, $X$ must be larger than $O_{i+1}$. The smallest $O_{i+1}$ can be is $1$.\nSo $X$ must be strictly greater than $1$ for $s_i='1'$.\nIf $s_i='0'$, $X$ must be smaller than $O_{i+1}$. The largest $O_{i+1}$ can be is $2^n$.\nSo $X$ must be strictly smaller than $2^n$ for $s_i='0'$.\n\nThe total number of teams $X$ must be greater than is $2^{cnt_1}-1$. This is the number of teams that $X$ would have defeated if all $s_i='1'$.\nThe total number of teams $X$ must be smaller than is $2^{cnt_0}-1$. This is the number of teams that $X$ would have lost to if all $s_i='0'$.\n\nThis is because the $2^n$ teams are arranged in a binary tree.\nA team $X$ wins if it defeats $n$ opponents.\nLet $k_0 = cnt_0$ and $k_1 = cnt_1$.\nA team with skill $X$ must be greater than $k_1$ opponents and smaller than $k_0$ opponents.\nTo win, $X$ must be greater than $2^{k_1}-1$ teams in total. These are $X$'s direct opponents in phases where $s_i='1'$, and all the teams those opponents defeated, and so on.\nAnd $X$ must be smaller than $2^{k_0}-1$ teams in total.\nSo $X$ must be at least $1 + (2^{k_1}-1) = 2^{k_1}$.\nAnd $X$ must be at most $2^n - (2^{k_0}-1)$.\n\nThis is a known property for general playoff tournaments.\nIf a team wins $k_1$ games by being stronger and $k_0$ games by being weaker, then it must be stronger than $2^{k_1}-1$ other teams in the tournament and weaker than $2^{k_0}-1$ other teams.\nThis implies its skill $X$ must be in the range $[1 + (2^{k_1}-1), 2^n - (2^{k_0}-1)]$.\nThis range simplifies to $[2^{k_1}, 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1]$.\n\nThis formula matches all examples.\n$cnt_0 = s.count('0')$\n$cnt_1 = s.count('1')$\n$min\\_X = 2^{cnt_1}$\n$max\\_X = 2^n - 2^{cnt_0} + 1$\n\nThe implementation will be straightforward:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count $cnt_0$ and $cnt_1$.\n4. Calculate $min\\_X = 2^{cnt_1}$.\n5. Calculate $max\\_X = 2^n - 2^{cnt_0} + 1$.\n6. Print numbers from $min\\_X$ to $max\\_X$ space-separated.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    cnt_0 = s.count('0')\n    cnt_1 = s.count('1')\n\n    # The minimum winning skill is 2 raised to the power of the number of phases\n    # where the higher skill team wins (cnt_1).\n    min_winning_skill = 2**cnt_1\n\n    # The maximum winning skill is 2^n minus (2 raised to the power of the number\n    # of phases where the lower skill team wins (cnt_0)) plus 1.\n    max_winning_skill = (2**n) - (2**cnt_0) + 1\n\n    # Generate the list of winning integers\n    winning_integers = []\n    for x in range(min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill + 1):\n        winning_integers.append(str(x))\n\n    print(\" \".join(winning_integers))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
