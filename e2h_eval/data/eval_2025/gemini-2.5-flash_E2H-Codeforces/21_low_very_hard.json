The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Neko Finds Grapes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Neko Finds Grapes,\" and I need a Python script to solve it.  Let's break down the problem and come up with an efficient strategy.\n\nFirst, I see there are `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key opens a chest if their sum is odd.  That translates to one being even and the other being odd.  Perfect, it's a parity problem.\n\nMy initial thought is to classify both the chests and the keys based on their parity. We can count the number of even and odd chests, and also the number of even and odd keys.  Let's call these: `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`.\n\nThe core logic is clear now.  An even chest needs an odd key, and an odd chest needs an even key.  My goal is to maximize the number of opened chests, but each key and chest can only be used once. This means I want to pair even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The number of chests opened by each pair will be the minimum of the number of items in each group in the pair.\n\nEffectively, I'll be calculating `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` (even chests and odd keys) and `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` (odd chests and even keys). Since the pairings are independent, I can simply sum these two minima to get the total number of chests that can be opened.  Simple enough.\n\nSo, the algorithm will involve reading the input `n`, `m`, and the chest and key values. Then counting the parity of chests and keys as I read them. Once I have the counts, I can directly calculate `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.  Finally, print the result.\n\nLet me test this with the example, quickly. We have: `n = 5`, `m = 4`, `a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`, `b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`.\nChests: `9` (odd), `14` (even), `6` (even), `2` (even), `11` (odd). So, `chests_even = 3` and `chests_odd = 2`.\nKeys: `8` (even), `4` (even), `7` (odd), `20` (even). So, `keys_even = 3` and `keys_odd = 1`.\n`min(chests_even, keys_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n`min(chests_odd, keys_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`\nThe total chests that will be opened are `1 + 2 = 3`. Perfect, I think I've got it. Now, time to write some Python!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` implies that one of the numbers must be even and the other must be odd.\n*   If `a_i` is an even number, then `b_j` must be an odd number for the sum to be odd.\n*   If `a_i` is an odd number, then `b_j` must be an even number for the sum to be odd.\n\nThis means we can categorize both chests and keys by their parity (whether they are even or odd). Let's count them:\n*   `chests_even`: The count of chests with even numbers.\n*   `chests_odd`: The count of chests with odd numbers.\n*   `keys_even`: The count of keys with even numbers.\n*   `keys_odd`: The count of keys with odd numbers.\n\nTo maximize the number of opened chests, we need to make two types of pairings:\n1.  Pairing **even chests** with **odd keys**: The number of such pairings is limited by the minimum of available even chests and available odd keys. So, we can open `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` chests this way.\n2.  Pairing **odd chests** with **even keys**: Similarly, the number of such pairings is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince these two types of pairings use completely disjoint sets of keys (odd keys vs. even keys) and chests (even chests vs. odd chests), they are independent. The total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the maximums from these two types of pairings.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of chests opened is `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Initialize `chests_even = 0` and `chests_odd = 0`.\n3.  Read the `n` chest numbers. For each number `a_i`:\n    *   If `a_i` is even (`a_i % 2 == 0`), increment `chests_even`.\n    *   Else (if `a_i` is odd), increment `chests_odd`.\n4.  Initialize `keys_even = 0` and `keys_odd = 0`.\n5.  Read the `m` key numbers. For each number `b_j`:\n    *   If `b_j` is even (`b_j % 2 == 0`), increment `keys_even`.\n    *   Else (if `b_j` is odd), increment `keys_odd`.\n6.  Calculate the result: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7.  Print the result.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it only requires iterating through the chest numbers once and the key numbers once, performing constant time operations for each. The time complexity will be O(n + m).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # To open an even chest, we need an odd key.\n    # The number of such pairings is limited by the minimum of available even chests and odd keys.\n    opened_even_chests = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n\n    # To open an odd chest, we need an even key.\n    # The number of such pairings is limited by the minimum of available odd chests and even keys.\n    opened_odd_chests = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n\n    print(opened_even_chests + opened_odd_chests)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
