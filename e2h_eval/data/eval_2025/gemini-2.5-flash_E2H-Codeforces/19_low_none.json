The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**The Number Games - My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Number Games\" problem, and my expert intuition is already kicking in. We've got a tree structure representing districts, each with a contestant and a specific number of fans (2 to the power of the district number). The goal? Remove *k* contestants and maximize the total fans of the remaining connected component.\n\nMy first thought is always to understand the heart of the matter. We want to maximize the sum of powers of 2.  Since these powers grow exponentially, it's clear we want to keep the districts with the *largest* indices. This boils down to minimizing the sum of the removed districts, which is the same thing, just a different perspective.  So, in theory, the strategy should be to remove the smallest indices.\n\nThe key constraint here is the connectivity requirement. The remaining districts *must* form a connected component. This is critical. So, simply removing the first *k* districts might not work, because that could disconnect the remaining ones.\n\nMy thinking is leaning toward a greedy approach. Let's try to keep the districts with the highest indices, like `n`, `n-1`, `n-2`, and so on, down to `n-(n-k)+1`.  But that alone won't do it. We have to ensure these chosen districts are *connected*.  If they aren't, we'll need to strategically include other districts to maintain that connectivity.\n\nThis feels like a tree-based problem, perhaps a Dynamic Programming (DP) or a well-crafted greedy algorithm.  Since the goal is to maximize the sum of powers of 2, the greediness is clear:  keep the largest possible indices.  The main challenge is how to ensure the subgraph remains connected while being as greedy as possible.\n\nLet's reframe: We want a connected subgraph of *n-k* nodes with the highest fan count. So start with node `n` because that is the largest. We need to find `n-k-1` other nodes that are connected to it. This suggests a search-based approach, and the way the tree connects nodes together becomes really important. If we *must* choose between keeping node 5 or node 2, we *must* keep node 5.\n\nThis is a classic problem. It seems simple on the surface, but the connectivity constraint demands a clever, probably tree-traversal-based, solution. I'll need to explore the tree structure carefully to efficiently identify the *k* districts that need to be removed to maximize the remaining fan count while adhering to the connectivity rule. Time to dive deeper and figure out how to navigate this tree!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove `k` contestants (districts) such that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component, and the total number of fans of the remaining contestants is maximized. The number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`.\n\nMaximizing `sum(2^i)` for the remaining districts is equivalent to minimizing `sum(2^i)` for the removed districts. Since `2^i` grows exponentially with `i`, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices and removing districts with smaller indices.\n\nThe core idea is to find a connected component of `n-k` districts that includes the largest possible district numbers.\n\nLet's consider the districts in decreasing order of their numbers: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe want to select `n-k` districts. The district `n` offers the largest number of fans, so we should always try to keep it.\nIf we keep district `n`, we then need to select `n-k-1` more districts that are connected to `n` (possibly indirectly through other selected districts).\n\nThis problem can be solved by finding the largest possible connected component of `n-k` nodes that includes district `n`.\nWe can achieve this using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from district `n`. When exploring, we prioritize visiting unvisited neighbors with larger district numbers.\n\nHowever, a simpler greedy approach works:\n1. Initialize a set of `removed` districts.\n2. We want to keep `n-k` districts. Start by assuming we keep district `n`.\n3. We need to find `n-k-1` more districts.\n4. The key insight is that if we want to keep `X` districts in a connected component, and we want to maximize their sum of `2^i`, we should always include the district with the largest index, say `max_idx`, from the current set of available districts. Then, we need to find `X-1` more districts that are connected to `max_idx` (or to the component already formed).\n\nThis suggests a process of iteratively \"growing\" a connected component.\nLet's keep track of the `n-k` districts we want to *keep*.\nInitially, we want to keep district `n`.\nWe can perform a modified BFS/DFS starting from district `n`.\nWhen we visit a node, we add it to our \"kept\" set. We then try to visit its unvisited neighbors.\nTo maximize the sum, when we have a choice of neighbors to visit, we should always pick the neighbor with the largest district number.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts.\nLet's try to keep all districts from `n` down to `n-k+1`. This is `n-k` districts. If these form a connected component, then we are done: remove districts `1, 2, ..., n-k`.\nBut they might not form a connected component. For example, if district `n-k+1` is only connected to `1`, which we want to remove.\n\nThe correct greedy approach is as follows:\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts. We will identify `k` districts to remove.\nSince we want to maximize `sum(2^i)` for kept districts, we must keep district `n` (it has the most fans).\nWe can use a BFS-like approach.\n1. Initialize a `visited` array (or set) to keep track of districts we've decided to *keep*.\n2. Initialize a `queue` for BFS.\n3. Add district `n` to the `queue` and mark it as `visited`.\n4. We have `1` district kept so far. We need to keep `n-k-1` more.\n5. While the `queue` is not empty and we need to keep more districts:\n    a. Dequeue a district `u`.\n    b. Collect all unvisited neighbors of `u`.\n    c. Sort these neighbors in decreasing order of their district numbers.\n    d. For each neighbor `v` in this sorted list:\n        i. If `v` is not `visited` and we still need to keep more districts:\n            Add `v` to the `queue` and mark `v` as `visited`.\n            Increment the count of kept districts.\n        ii. If we have already kept `n-k` districts, break this loop (and the outer loop).\n\nThis greedy strategy ensures that we always expand our connected component using the largest available district number. By starting from `n` and always prioritizing larger-indexed neighbors, we build the optimal connected component.\n\nAfter the BFS completes, all districts marked `visited` are the ones we keep. The remaining `k` districts (those not visited) are the ones to be removed. Sort these `k` districts in increasing order for output.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n=6, k=3`\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\nWe need to keep `n-k = 6-3 = 3` districts.\nAdjacency List:\n1: [2]\n2: [1, 6, 4, 3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2, 5]\n\n1. Start BFS from `n=6`.\n   `queue = [6]`, `visited = {6}`, `kept_count = 1`.\n   We need to keep `3-1 = 2` more districts.\n\n2. Dequeue `u=6`. Neighbors of 6: `[2, 5]`.\n   Sort neighbors in descending order: `[5, 2]`.\n   a. Consider `v=5`: Not visited. `kept_count < 3`. Add 5 to queue.\n      `queue = [5]`, `visited = {6, 5}`, `kept_count = 2`.\n   b. Consider `v=2`: Not visited. `kept_count < 3`. Add 2 to queue.\n      `queue = [5, 2]`, `visited = {6, 5, 2}`, `kept_count = 3`.\n   We have kept 3 districts. Stop.\n\nThe kept districts are `{2, 5, 6}`.\nThe districts to be removed are `all_districts - kept_districts = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {2, 5, 6} = {1, 3, 4}`.\nOutput in increasing order: `1 3 4`. This matches the sample output.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n* Use an adjacency list for the tree.\n* Use a `deque` for the BFS queue for efficiency.\n* A boolean array `visited` or `kept` of size `n+1` is suitable.\n* After BFS, iterate from `1` to `n` to find non-visited districts and add them to a list, then sort and print.\n\n**Complexity:**\n* Building adjacency list: `O(N)` (since `N-1` edges).\n* BFS: Each node and edge is processed at most once. Sorting neighbors for each node is `O(deg * log(deg))` where `deg` is degree. In total, sum of `deg * log(deg)` over all nodes is bounded by `O(N log N)` in the worst case (e.g., star graph), or `O(N)` if degrees are small. Given `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is acceptable.\n* Finding removed districts and sorting: `O(N + k log k)`.\nTotal complexity: `O(N log N)` due to sorting neighbors in BFS.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # We want to keep n-k districts.\n    # Start BFS from district n, as it has the most fans (2^n).\n    # Prioritize neighbors with larger district numbers.\n\n    kept_districts = [False] * (n + 1)\n    q = deque()\n    \n    # Start with district n\n    q.append(n)\n    kept_districts[n] = True\n    num_kept = 1\n\n    # Store neighbors to sort them for prioritized processing\n    # The queue will store nodes to be processed.\n    # When processing a node, its neighbors are considered.\n    # To prioritize larger-indexed neighbors, we can collect them, sort, and then add to the queue.\n    # A simpler way is to just add them to the queue and let the queue order handle it if it's a priority queue.\n    # But a standard deque (FIFO) won't prioritize.\n    # The correct way for a standard BFS is to collect all neighbors, sort them, and *then* enqueue.\n    # However, this means we re-sort for each node.\n    # A more efficient approach for this specific greedy strategy:\n    # Use a min-priority queue to store available neighbors to visit, ordered by district number (max-heap for largest).\n    # Or, simulate a max-heap by storing neighbors in a list, sorting, and then adding them to the BFS queue.\n\n    # Let's use a standard BFS queue, but when we extract neighbors, we sort them before adding.\n    # This implies that the 'current' BFS queue contains nodes whose neighbors haven't been fully explored.\n    # A better way to implement the greedy choice:\n    # We maintain a set of 'active' nodes that are part of our growing component.\n    # From these active nodes, we look at all unvisited neighbors.\n    # We always pick the unvisited neighbor with the largest ID.\n\n    # This is effectively a variation of Dijkstra's or Prim's algorithm, but for node indices.\n    # We can use a max-heap to store potential next nodes to add to our component.\n    # The heap will store tuples (-district_id, district_id) to simulate a max-heap.\n\n    import heapq\n    \n    # Max-heap to store (negative_district_id, district_id) for available nodes to add\n    # Initially, only district n is kept.
