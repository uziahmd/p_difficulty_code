    "thought": "**Thinking Through the LCM Minimization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`. My first thought is to simplify this by letting `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`.  Now, the objective is to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\n\nI remember the relationship between LCM and GCD: `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.  Aha! Also, the difference between `x` and `y` is just `b - a`, since the `k` cancels out. So, `y - x = b - a`. This is important.\n\nNow, if `d = gcd(x, y)`, then `d` must also divide `y - x`. This means `d` must divide the absolute difference, `diff = |b - a|`.  \n\nIf `a` equals `b`, then `diff` is 0. In this case, the `lcm` becomes `lcm(a+k, a+k)`, which is simply `a+k`.  To minimize this, I just choose the smallest `k`, which is 0. So, if `a = b`, the answer is `k = 0`. Easy!\n\nLet's assume `a` is not equal to `b`. This means `diff > 0`. Since `d` is a divisor of `diff`, I need to iterate over all divisors of `diff`.  \n\nLet's represent `x` and `y` using `d`: `x = d * x'` and `y = d * y'`, where `x'` and `y'` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). Then the LCM is `d * x' * y'`.\n\nAssume that `a < b` and `diff = b - a`.\n\nTo make `d` divide `a+k`, I want `a+k` to be a multiple of `d`. This means `a+k = m * d`, where `m` is an integer. Thus `k = m * d - a`.  I want the smallest non-negative `k`, so `m * d` must be the smallest multiple of `d` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This means `m = ceil(a/d)`.\n\nSo, `k = d * ceil(a/d) - a`. I can simplify this further. If I do, I will have `k = (-a) % d`.\n\nNow, for each divisor `d` of `diff`, I can calculate this `k` and then compute the corresponding `lcm`. I'll keep track of the smallest `lcm` I find and the corresponding `k`. That's the solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes `lcm(a+k, b+k)`. If multiple `k` values yield the same minimum LCM, we choose the smallest `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nLet `d = gcd(x, y)`. A key property of the greatest common divisor is that `d` must divide `y - x`.\nSince `y - x = (b+k) - (a+k) = b - a`, `d` must be a divisor of `abs(b - a)`.\n\n**Case 1: `a = b`**\nIf `a = b`, then `x = a+k` and `y = b+k = a+k`.\nSo `lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize `a+k`, we choose the smallest possible non-negative `k`, which is `k=0`.\nThe minimum LCM is `a`.\n\n**Case 2: `a != b`**\nLet `diff = abs(b - a)`. Since `a != b`, `diff > 0`.\nWe know that `d` must be a divisor of `diff`.\nThis observation is crucial because `diff` can be up to `10^9`, which has a limited number of divisors. The maximum number of divisors for a number up to `10^9` is relatively small (e.g., `735134400` has 1344 divisors, `720720` has 240 divisors, `963761196` has 128 divisors). We can find all divisors of `diff` efficiently.\n\nFor each divisor `d` of `diff`:\nWe need `d` to be `gcd(a+k, b+k)`. For this to be possible, `a+k` must be a multiple of `d`, and `b+k` must be a multiple of `d`.\nSince `b+k = a+k + (b-a)`, if `a+k` is a multiple of `d` and `b-a` (which is `diff` or `-diff`) is a multiple of `d`, then `b+k` will automatically be a multiple of `d`.\nSo, for a given divisor `d` of `diff`, we need to find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `d`.\nThis `k` can be calculated as `k = (-a) % d`.\nLet `k_d = (-a) % d`.\nWith this `k_d`, `x_d = a+k_d` and `y_d = b+k_d`.\nThe `lcm` value for this `k_d` is `(x_d * y_d) // gcd(x_d, y_d)`.\nWe iterate through all divisors `d` of `diff`, calculate the corresponding `k_d` and `lcm_d`, and keep track of the minimum `lcm` found so far and the smallest `k` that achieved it.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize `min_lcm` to infinity and `best_k` to 0.\n2. If `a == b`, print `0` and exit.\n3. Calculate `diff = abs(b - a)`.\n4. Find all divisors of `diff`. A common way is to iterate from `1` up to `sqrt(diff)`. If `i` divides `diff`, then both `i` and `diff // i` are divisors.\n5. For each divisor `d` in the list of divisors:\n   a. Calculate `k = (-a) % d`. This is the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `d`.\n   b. Calculate `current_x = a+k` and `current_y = b+k`.\n   c. Calculate `current_lcm = (current_x * current_y) // math.gcd(current_x, current_y)`.\n   d. If `current_lcm < min_lcm`:\n      Set `min_lcm = current_lcm` and `best_k = k`.\n   e. Else if `current_lcm == min_lcm`:\n      Set `best_k = min(best_k, k)` (to ensure we pick the smallest `k`).\n6. Print `best_k`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (a=6, b=10):**\n1. `a != b`.\n2. `diff = abs(10 - 6) = 4`.\n3. Divisors of `4`: `[1, 2, 4]`.\n\nLet's test each divisor `d`:\n*   **`d = 1`**:\n    *   `k = (-6) % 1 = 0`.\n    *   `x = 6+0 = 6`, `y = 10+0 = 10`.\n    *   `lcm(6, 10) = (6 * 10) // gcd(6, 10) = 60 // 2 = 30`.\n    *   `min_lcm = 30`, `best_k = 0`.\n\n*   **`d = 2`**:\n    *   `k = (-6) % 2 = 0`.\n    *   `x = 6+0 = 6`, `y = 10+0 = 10`.\n    *   `lcm(6, 10) = 30`.\n    *   `current_lcm (30) == min_lcm (30)`. `best_k = min(0, 0) = 0`. (Note: The example output is `2`, so there must be a smaller LCM. My calculation for `k` is correct for `a+k` to be a multiple of `d`. The `gcd(x,y)` might not be `d`. The logic is that `d` *could be* the `gcd`, so we try to make `a+k` a multiple of `d`.)\n\nLet's re-evaluate the assumption that `gcd(x_d, y_d)` will be `d`. It's not necessarily `d`. It will be a multiple of `d`. The calculation `lcm(x_d, y_d) = (x_d * y_d) // gcd(x_d, y_d)` is always correct.\n\nLet's trace `a=6, b=10` again with the correct `k` and `lcm` calculation:\n`min_lcm = infinity`, `best_k = 0`.\n`diff = 4`. Divisors: `1, 2, 4`.\n\n*   **`d = 1`**:\n    *   `k = (-6) % 1 = 0`.\n    *   `x = 6+0 = 6`, `y = 10+0 = 10`.\n    *   `lcm(6, 10) = 30`.\n    *   `min_lcm = 30`, `best_k = 0`.\n\n*   **`d = 2`**:\n    *   `k = (-6) % 2 = 0`.\n    *   `x = 6+0 = 6`, `y = 10+0 = 10`.\n    *   `lcm(6, 10) = 30`.\n    *   `current_lcm (30) == min_lcm (30)`. `best_k = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n*   **`d = 4`**:\n    *   `k = (-6) % 4 = 2`.\n    *   `x = 6+2 = 8`, `y = 10+2 = 12`.\n    *   `lcm(8, 12) = (8 * 12) // gcd(8, 12) = 96 // 4 = 24`.\n    *   `current_lcm (24) < min_lcm (30)`.\n    *   `min_lcm = 24`, `best_k = 2`.\n\nAfter checking all divisors, the result is `best_k = 2`. This matches the example.\n\nThe approach is sound. The maximum value for `a, b` is `10^9`. `diff` can be up to `10^9`.\nFinding divisors up to `sqrt(10^9)` (approx `31622`) is efficient.\nThe number of divisors for `N <= 10^9` is at most `1344` (for `735134400`).\nFor each divisor, we do a few arithmetic operations and a `gcd` calculation. Python's `math.gcd` is efficient.\nThe overall complexity will be `O(sqrt(diff) + num_divisors * log(max(x,y)))`, which is well within time limits.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    diff = abs(b - a)\n\n    min_lcm_val = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0 # Initialize best_k, it will be updated.\n\n    # Find all divisors of diff\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):\n        if diff % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(diff // i)\n    \n    # Iterate through each divisor 'd' of diff\n    # For each 'd', we want to find the smallest k such that a+k is a multiple of d.\n    # This k is (-a) % d.\n    # With this k, a+k is a multiple of d, and since b-a is a multiple of d,\n    # b+k = (a+k) + (b-a) will also be a multiple of d.\n    # So, gcd(a+k, b+k) will be at least d.\n    # We then calculate the actual lcm for this k.\n    \n    for d in sorted(list(divisors)): # Sort to ensure smallest k is picked first for same LCM\n        # Calculate k such that a+k is a multiple of d\n        k = (-a) % d\n        \n        current_x = a + k\n        current_y = b + k\n        \n        # Calculate LCM(current_x, current_y)\n        # lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (current_x * current_y) // math.gcd(current_x, current_y)\n        \n        # Update min_lcm_val and best_k\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm_val:\n            min_lcm_val = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm_val:\n            # If LCMs are equal, choose the smallest k\n            best_k = min(best_k, k)\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
