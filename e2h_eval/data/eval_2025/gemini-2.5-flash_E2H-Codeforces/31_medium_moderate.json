Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Solution Strategy: Vanya and Cards Problem**\n\nI'm tackling the \"Vanya and Cards\" problem. The core is figuring out the minimum cards Vanya needs to reach a total sum of zero, given the existing cards and the constraints on card values.\n\nHere's how I'm approaching this:\n\n1.  **Understand the setup:** Vanya has `n` cards. Their sum needs to be zero. Each card's value must fall within the range `[-x, x]`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the existing sum:** First, I'll sum the values of the given `n` cards. Let's call this the `current_sum`.\n\n3.  **Determine the required value:**  To reach a zero sum, Vanya needs a `target_value` that's the negative of the `current_sum` (i.e., `target_value = -current_sum`).\n\n4.  **Special case: sum is already zero:** If the `target_value` is `0`, then no additional cards are needed. Return `0`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Minimum Cards to cover `target_value`:** If the `target_value` isn't `0`, I need to figure out how many cards are necessary to contribute this value. The `target_value` could be positive or negative. The most efficient strategy involves using cards that have the largest possible absolute value. Specifically, it's about minimizing the number of cards needed to reach `abs(target_value)` using the largest possible card values (up to `x`).\n    *   I'll calculate the `abs(target_value)`.\n    *   To get the minimum number of cards, I'll divide `abs(target_value)` by `x` and round up to the nearest integer.\n    *   The integer math trick is to use `(abs_target + x - 1) // x`.\n\n6. **Implement:** I'll implement this logic in Python, reading the input, calculating the sum, and determining the minimum card count using integer math to ensure an optimal solution.\n\nThis solution ensures the fewest cards are added to meet the condition and is designed to handle various scenarios correctly and efficiently. I'll test it against some test cases to ensure its correctness.\n",
