Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing a Tricky String Transformation Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got a competitive programming problem here. It looks like a string manipulation puzzle, but the core issue is efficiency. I need to transform an initial string *s* of digits, based on a series of replacement queries, and then calculate the result modulo 10^9 + 7. The catch? The intermediate string lengths could explode exponentially!\n\nLet's break it down. There's an initial string *s*. We receive *n* queries, each of the form \"digit *d* gets replaced by string *t*\". These replacements need to be done sequentially. Finally, I need to convert the resulting string into a number (ignoring leading zeros) and find its remainder when divided by 10^9 + 7.\n\nThe constraints are manageable: length of *s* and the number of queries are both at most 10^5, and the sum of lengths of replacement strings is also bounded. However, directly simulating the string replacements is a disaster. If one digit expands into a long string, and that string then gets replaced by an even longer one, the memory and time complexity become astronomical.  Think about it, if *s* is just \"1\" and the first query is \"1 -> 11111\", the string length will grow fast. This gets me thinking about the time complexity: `|s| * (max_len_ti)^(n_queries_affecting_digit)`.\n\nThe crucial insight is that I can't construct the final string explicitly. That's a huge clue! I need to calculate the answer modulo *M* without ever building the whole string.\n\nLooking at how a number is represented, something like `d_k d_{k-1} ... d_0` is equal to `d_k * 10^k + d_{k-1} * 10^(k-1) + ... + d_0 * 10^0`. This can be re-written as `( ... (d_k * 10 + d_{k-1}) * 10 + ... ) * 10 + d_0`.\n\nSo, the original string *s* of digits, each digit will eventually transform into a string, *T_i*. The final string is just the concatenation of these transformed strings, `T_0 T_1 ... T_{|s|-1}`.  Concatenating number strings is equivalent to `A * 10^(length_of_B) + B`. All calculations must be modulo *M*.\n\nHere's my plan. I'll maintain `val[d]` and `len[d]` for each digit *d*. `val[d]` will store the numerical value (modulo *M*) of the string that *d* eventually becomes, and `len[d]` will store the length of this string. Initially, `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1`. Then, when a query comes, I need to update these values for the digit being replaced. The real challenge is going to be how to efficiently update these `val` and `len` values while handling the modulo arithmetic correctly. This looks like the right approach, given this framework.\n",
    "response": "The core idea to solve this problem is to process the queries in reverse order. This allows us to calculate the final value and length for each digit (0-9) efficiently without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous final string.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\nWe maintain two arrays (or dictionaries):\n1.  `val[d]`: Stores the numerical value (modulo `MOD`) that a single digit `d` eventually transforms into.\n2.  `length[d]`: Stores the length (modulo `MOD-1` for powers of 10, but actually just the raw length for concatenation logic, clamped at `MOD-1` or larger to avoid overflow if needed, but for powers of 10, `MOD-1` is sufficient) of the string that a single digit `d` eventually transforms into. Since `MOD` is prime, by Fermat's Little Theorem, `10^L mod MOD = 10^(L mod (MOD-1)) mod MOD`. This is important for calculating powers of 10.\n\n**Initialization (before any queries):**\nFor each digit `d` from '0' to '9':\n*   `val[d] = d` (the integer value of the digit itself)\n*   `length[d] = 1` (a single digit has length 1)\n\n**Processing Queries in Reverse:**\nWhen we process queries from `n-1` down to `0`:\nFor a query `di -> ti`:\nWe need to update `val[di]` and `length[di]` based on the current `val` and `length` values of the digits present in `ti`.\n\nLet `current_val = 0` and `current_len = 0`.\nIterate through `char` in `ti` from right to left (this is crucial for correct concatenation logic):\n*   `digit = int(char)`\n*   `current_val = (val[digit] * pow(10, current_len, MOD) + current_val) % MOD`\n*   `current_len = (length[digit] + current_len) % (MOD - 1)` (We use `MOD-1` for length because it will be an exponent for `pow(10, L, MOD)`. If `length[digit]` is 0, it means `ti` is empty. If `ti` itself is empty, `current_len` will remain 0. If `current_len` is 0, `pow(10, 0, MOD)` is 1. If `length[digit]` is 0, we should not add 0 to `current_len`, as it might make `current_len` become 0 if it was `MOD-1`. We should be careful. `length[digit]` can be 0 if `digit` mapped to an empty string. So `current_len` should accumulate actual lengths. If `length[digit]` is 0, it means `digit` maps to an empty string, so it doesn't contribute to the overall length. The `MOD-1` is only for the exponent in `pow(10, exponent, MOD)`. The actual length can be larger than `MOD-1` if we were to sum it. But since we only need its value modulo `MOD-1` for exponentiation, we can cap it there.)\n\nA safer way to handle `current_len` for `pow(10, current_len, MOD)` is to ensure `current_len` never exceeds `MOD-1`. However, `current_len` itself is an exponent. If `length[digit]` is 0, it means the digit maps to an empty string, so it doesn't contribute to the length. The `current_len` should be the sum of actual lengths. For the exponent, we can take it modulo `MOD-1`.\n\nLet's refine the `current_len` update. `current_len` needs to track the length of the string formed by `char`s processed so far, so it can be used as an exponent.\nIf `ti` is empty, `current_val` remains 0, `current_len` remains 0.\nIf `ti` is not empty:\n`current_val = 0`\n`current_len_exponent = 0`\nFor `char` in `ti` (from left to right for string building, but for value calculation, it's easier right to left):\nLet `d = int(char)`.\nThe value of `d` is `val[d]`. The length of string `d` becomes is `length[d]`.\nWhen we append `val[d]` to the left of `current_val`:\n`new_value = (val[d] * pow(10, current_len_exponent, MOD) + current_val) % MOD`\n`new_length_exponent = (length[d] + current_len_exponent) % (MOD - 1)`\n`current_val = new_value`\n`current_len_exponent = new_length_exponent`\n\nAfter iterating through all characters in `ti`:\n`val[di] = current_val`\n`length[di] = current_len_exponent` (This `length[di]` will be used as an exponent for `10` in subsequent calculations.)\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nAfter processing all `n` queries in reverse, we have the final `val[d]` and `length[d]` for each original digit.\nNow, iterate through the initial string `s` from left to right:\n`final_value = 0`\n`final_len_exponent = 0` (this is the exponent for the current power of 10)\nFor `char` in `s`:\n*   `digit = int(char)`\n*   `final_value = (val[digit] * pow(10, final_len_exponent, MOD) + final_value) % MOD`\n*   `final_len_exponent = (length[digit] + final_len_exponent) % (MOD - 1)`\n\nThe final answer is `final_value`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (222, 2 queries: 2->0, 0->7):**\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n\n**Initial state:**\n`val = {0:0, 1:1, 2:2, ..., 9:9}`\n`length = {0:1, 1:1, 2:1, ..., 9:1}`\n\n**Queries (reversed):**\n1.  `0 -> 7` (original query index 1)\n    *   `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`\n    *   `current_val = 0`, `current_len_exponent = 0`\n    *   For `char = '7'`: `d = 7`.\n        *   `new_value = (val[7] * pow(10, 0, MOD) + 0) % MOD = (7 * 1 + 0) % MOD = 7`\n        *   `new_length_exponent = (length[7] + 0) % (MOD-1) = (1 + 0) % (MOD-1) = 1`\n        *   `current_val = 7`, `current_len_exponent = 1`\n    *   Update `val[0] = 7`, `length[0] = 1`.\n\n2.  `2 -> 0` (original query index 0)\n    *   `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`\n    *   `current_val = 0`, `current_len_exponent = 0`\n    *   For `char = '0'`: `d = 0`.\n        *   `new_value = (val[0] * pow(10, 0, MOD) + 0) % MOD = (7 * 1 + 0) % MOD = 7` (Note: `val[0]` is now 7 from previous step)\n        *   `new_length_exponent = (length[0] + 0) % (MOD-1) = (1 + 0) % (MOD-1) = 1` (Note: `length[0]` is now 1 from previous step)\n        *   `current_val = 7`, `current_len_exponent = 1`\n    *   Update `val[2] = 7`, `length[2] = 1`.\n\n**Final state of `val` and `length` for relevant digits:**\n`val = {0:7, 1:1, 2:7, ..., 9:9}` (only 0 and 2 changed)\n`length = {0:1, 1:1, 2:1, ..., 9:1}` (only 0 and 2 changed)\n\n**Process initial string `s = \"222\"`:**\n`final_value = 0`, `final_len_exponent = 0`\n\n1.
