He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "**Analyzing Snowflake Structure for Efficient Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm aiming to craft a Python script to tackle the \"Rudolf and Snowflakes (hard version)\" problem.  My initial thought is to break down the structure of these snowflakes.  It seems the key lies in how the vertices are connected and what constitutes a valid snowflake.\n\nA snowflake starts with a single center vertex.  From this center, 'k' new vertices branch out (level 1). The total vertices at this stage are 1 + k. Now, here's where it gets interesting: any vertex connected to only one other vertex gets 'k' new children.  I'm thinking this is the core recursive element.\n\nLet's say we only add level 2 vertices once. Initially, those 'k' level 1 vertices are connected to only the center. So, they get 'k' new vertices each (level 2).  The total count would be 1 + k + k^2. The figure in the example for k=4 (21 vertices) seems to correspond to this configuration. Does the rule necessitate adding new layers indefinitely? The text says the rule should be done *at least once*, which implies we have a choice of when to stop.  If it stops here, the level 2 vertices are the leaves.\n\nThe problem describes how to add more levels. Let 'd' be the number of times we apply the \"add k children\" rule. If d=1, we have 1 + k + k^2 vertices. However, \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex...\". The example with k=4 makes it clear the answer must be 1+k+k^2 vertices, not a potentially infinite number. The example is small, but very useful!\n\nSo, the total number of vertices becomes a geometric series: `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(d+1)`, which can be written as `(k^(d+2) - 1) / (k - 1)`. The least possible snowflake has d=1 (smallest)\n\nNow, here's the game plan: For a given input 'n', my script needs to check if 'n' can be expressed in the form of this series.\n\n1.  Is n a valid snowflake (YES/NO), where the equation is `n = (k^(M+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n2. The parameters have the following constraints:\n*   k > 1\n*   M >= 2\n\nI'll check for integer solutions of k given n.\n\nI'll first check if the basic form:  `n = 1 + k + k^2`. If this works, it means there is only 2 layers. We are essentially trying to find a perfect square, as it simplifies to a quadratic equation. Calculate `D = 4n - 3`. If 'D' is a perfect square and `k = (-1 + sqrt(D)) / 2 > 1`, then n fits the pattern.\n\nIf that fails, then I need to consider higher values of 'M'.\nI will handle cases where the base `k=2`, as `n=2^(M+1) -1` and iterate for `M>=3`.\n\nOtherwise, iterate M from `3` to a reasonable maximum limit which is 59 as 2^60 > 10^18.\n\nHere I will implement a binary search to find an integer `k` for a given `M`.\nThe search space for `k` is from `2` (the smallest possible value for k) up to `n^(1/M)`, but I'll add `2` just in case. The upper bound is `10^9`\n\nWithin the binary search, I need to compute the `current_sum = 1 + k + ... + k^M`. Here I need to watch out for potential integer overflow, but Python's arbitrary precision should handle this without explicit checks, it is important to take `current_sum` if `term > n`, as the overflow can cause bad performance or even wrong answers.\n\nThe overall complexity seems to be `O(log(n))` in the binary search, performed up to about 58 times (`M` from 3 to 59). That's 58 * log(10^9) = about 60 * 30, which gives around 1800 steps.\nI should be able to make it run within the time limits.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given number `n` can represent the total number of vertices in a snowflake graph. A snowflake is defined by a parameter `k > 1` and a number of branching steps `d >= 1`.\n\nThe structure of a snowflake is as follows:\n1. Start with 1 central vertex.\n2. Connect the central vertex to `k` new vertices (level 1). Total vertices: `1 + k`.\n3. Apply the rule `d` times: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to `k` more new vertices.\"\n   - After the first application (`d=1`): The `k` level 1 vertices are connected to only one other vertex (the center). Each of these sprouts `k` new children (level 2). Total vertices: `1 + k + k*k = 1 + k + k^2`.\n   - After the second application (`d=2`): The `k^2` level 2 vertices are connected to only one other vertex. Each of these sprouts `k` new children (level 3). Total vertices: `1 + k + k^2 + k^3`.\n   - In general, after `d` applications, the total number of vertices will be `n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(d+1)`.\nLet `M = d+1`. Since `d >= 1`, we must have `M >= 2`.\nSo, `n` must be expressible as the sum of a geometric series: `n = sum_{i=0}^{M} k^i`, where `k > 1` and `M >= 2`.\n\nThis sum can be written as `n = (k^(M+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n\nWe need to check if for a given `n` (up to `10^18`), there exist integers `k > 1` and `M >= 2` satisfying this equation.\n\nThe approach involves two main parts:\n\n**1. Check for `M=2`**\nIf `M=2`, the equation becomes `n = 1 + k + k^2`.\nThis is a quadratic equation in `k`: `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.\nUsing the quadratic formula, `k = (-1 +/- sqrt(1 - 4 * (1 - n))) / 2 = (-1 +/- sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`.\nFor `k` to be a valid integer:\n   - `4n - 3` must be a perfect square. Let `S = sqrt(4n - 3)`.\n   - `S` must be an integer.\n   - We need `k > 1`, so we take the positive root: `k = (S - 1) / 2`.\n   - `(S - 1)` must be an even positive number, which means `S` must be an odd integer greater than `3`.\nWe can check this by calculating `D = 4n - 3`, finding `S = int(D**0.5)`, and then verifying `S*S == D`, `S > 3`, and `(S-1) % 2 == 0`. If all conditions are met, `n` is a snowflake.\n\n**2. Check for `M > 2`**\nFor `M > 2`, `n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^M`.\nSince `k >= 2`, the smallest possible sum for a given `M` is when `k=2`: `n = 1 + 2 + ... + 2^M = 2^(M+1) - 1`.\nGiven `n <= 10^18`, we have `2^(M+1) - 1 <= 10^18`.\n`2^(M+1) <= 10^18 + 1`.\nTaking `log2` on both sides: `M+1 <= log2(10^18 + 1) approx 18 * log2(10) approx 18 * 3.3219 approx 59.79`.\nSo, `M+1` can be at most `59`. This means `M` can range from `3` up to `58`. This is a small range for `M`.\n\nFor each `M` in `[3, 58]`:\nWe need to find an integer `k > 1` such that `1 + k + ... + k^M = n`.\nThe function `f(k) = 1 + k + ... + k^M` is monotonically increasing for `k > 1`. We can use binary search to find `k`.\n   - Lower bound for `k`: `k_min = 2`.\n   - Upper bound for `k`: Since `k^M < n`, `k < n^(1/M)`. So, `k_max = int(n**(1/M)) + 2` (adding a small buffer for floating-point precision). For `M=3, n=10^18`, `k_max` is about `10^6`. For larger `M`, `k_max` becomes much smaller (e.g., for `M=58`, `k_max` is 2).\n\nInside the binary search:\n   - Calculate `current_sum = 1 + k_mid + ... + k_mid^M`.\n   - To prevent overflow in intermediate calculations (Python handles large integers automatically, but this check is good for efficiency to avoid huge numbers when `k_mid` is too large):\n     - If `k_mid` is 1, it's not allowed.\n     - If `k_mid > (n + 1) / 2` and `M >= 1`, then `k_mid^M` alone could be greater than `n`. More generally, if `k_mid` is large, `k_mid^M` can quickly exceed `n`. We can check if `term > n` or `current_sum > n` during accumulation.\n     - A robust way to compute the sum `current_sum = (k_mid^(M+1) - 1) / (k_mid - 1)`:\n       `term = 1`\n       `current_sum = 1`\n       `for i from 1 to M`:\n         `if n // k_mid < term`: (Check for potential overflow before `term *= k_mid`)\n           `current_sum = n + 1` (Indicate sum is too large)\n           `break`\n         `term *= k_mid`\n         `if n - term < current_sum`: (Check for potential overflow before `current_sum += term`)\n           `current_sum = n + 1`\n           `break`\n         `current_sum += term`\n   - Compare `current_sum` with `n`:\n     - If `current_sum == n`, we found a solution, return `True`.\n     - If `current_sum < n`, increase `k_mid` (set `low = k_mid + 1`).\n     - If `current_sum > n`, decrease `k_mid` (set `high = k_mid - 1`).\n\n**Edge Case `n < 7`:**\nThe smallest possible snowflake is for `k=2, M=2`, which gives `1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7` vertices. Any `n < 7` cannot be a snowflake. So, if `n < 7`, output \"NO\".\n\n**Overall Algorithm:**\n1. Read `t`.\n2. For each test case `n`:\n   a. If `n < 7`, print \"NO\".\n   b. Else, check for `M=2`:\n      Calculate `D = 4*n - 3`.\n      `S = int(D**0.5)`.\n      If `S*S == D` and `S > 3` and `(S-1) % 2 == 0`:\n         `k = (S-1) // 2`.\n         If `k > 1`, print \"YES\" and continue to next test case.\n   c. If not found for `M=2`, iterate `M` from `3` to `58`:\n      Run binary search for `k` in range `[2, int(n**(1/M)) + 2]`.\n      If a valid `k` is found for any `M`, print \"YES\" and continue to next test case.\n   d. If no solution is found after checking all `M`, print \"NO\".\n\n**Example `n=10^18`:**\n1. `n >= 7`.\n2. `M=2`: `D = 4*10^18 - 3`. `sqrt(D)` is not an integer. No solution for `M=2`.\n3. `M=3` to `58`:\n   - For `M=3`: `k_max = int((10^18)**(1/3)) + 2 = 10^6 + 2`. Binary search `k` in `[2, 10^6+2]`. No `k` is found.\n   - For `M=4`: `k_max = int((10^18)**(1/4)) + 2 = 31622 + 2`. Binary search `k` in `[2, 31624]`. No `k` is found.\n   ...\n   - For `M=58`: `k_max = int((10^18)**(1/58)) + 2 = int(2.02) + 2 = 4`. Binary search `k` in `[2, 4]`.\n     - Try `k=2`: `sum = 2^59 - 1`. This is `~5.76 * 10^17`, which is less than `10^18`.\n     - Try `k=3`: `sum = (3^59 - 1) / 2`. This is `~1.15 * 10^28`, which is greater than `10^18`.\n     - Try `k=4`: `sum = (4^59 - 1) / 3`. This is `~1.93 * 10^35`, which is greater than `10^18`.\n   No `k` is found for any `M`. Output \"NO\".\n\nThis approach is efficient enough. The `M` loop runs about 56 times. The binary search runs at most `log(10^6)` (for `M=3`) which is about 20 iterations. Each iteration performs `M` multiplications/additions, max 58. So `56 * 20 * 58` operations per test case, which is roughly `65,000`. For `10^4` test cases, total operations are `6.5 * 10^8`, which is acceptable within typical time limits (1-2 seconds).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n < 7: # Smallest snowflake is 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Case M = 2: n = 1 + k + k^2\n    # k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0\n    # k = (-1 + sqrt(1 - 4(1 - n))) / 2\n    # k = (-1 + sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2\n    \n    discriminant = 4 * n - 3\n    s_float = math.isqrt(discriminant) # integer square root\n    \n    if s_float * s_float == discriminant:\n        # Check if s_float is odd and > 3, so (s_float - 1) is even and > 2\n        if (s_float - 1) % 2 == 0 and s_float > 3:\n            k = (s_float - 1) // 2\n            if k > 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                return\n\n    # Case M > 2: n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^M\n    # M can go up to ~58 (since 2^59 - 1 is approx 5.76 * 10^17 < 10^18, 2^60 - 1 > 10^18)\n    # So M+1 can be at most 59.
