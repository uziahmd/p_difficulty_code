Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Vanya and the Lanterns: Finding the Optimal Illumination**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for Vanya and the Lanterns. The problem seems pretty straightforward: a street of length *l*, some lanterns at positions *a<sub>i</sub>*, and each lantern illuminates a distance *d* on either side. The goal is to find the *minimum* *d* needed to light the entire street.\n\nFirst, I need to truly *understand* the problem's constraints. I know the entire street, from 0 to *l*, must be lit.  Each point *x* on the street, therefore, must fall within the range of at least one lantern; that is, there has to be an *a<sub>i</sub>* such that *a<sub>i</sub>* - *d* ≤ *x* ≤ *a<sub>i</sub>* + *d*. It's all about covering that segment [0, *l*].\n\nMy main strategy is going to be sorting, sorting, sorting.  If I sort those lantern positions, *a<sub>i</sub>*, into say, *sorted_a*, the analysis becomes far more manageable.  The crucial part is identifying the \"gaps\" – the unlit segments.\n\n1.  **Deal with the Edges:** The start of the street, at 0, has to be covered. That means the leftmost lantern (*sorted_a*[0]) must have a *d* of at least *sorted_a*[0]. Similarly, the end of the street, at *l*, requires the rightmost lantern to reach *l*. That means *d* must be at least *l* - *sorted_a*[n-1] where n is the number of lanterns.\n\n2.  **Tackle the Gaps Between Lanterns:**  The real trick is what's in between those lanterns.  Consider any two adjacent lanterns, *a<sub>i</sub>* and *a<sub>i+1</sub>*. The segment between them, *(a<sub>i</sub>*, *a<sub>i+1</sub>*) needs to be lit. The worst-case scenario, the biggest gap, is in the middle of these. To illuminate that midpoint, both lanterns must \"reach\" at least half the distance between them.  So, I'm going to calculate the maximum gap between adjacent lanterns, (*a<sub>i+1</sub>* - *a<sub>i</sub>*)/2, across all lanterns.\n\n3.  **Find the Maximum:** Finally, I'll need to figure out which *d* will work for all of them. I need to take the maximum of three values: the distance from the first lantern to the start (0), the distance from the last lantern to the end (l), and half the largest gap between lanterns.  That maximum value is the minimum *d* that will light the entire street.\n\n**Implementation Steps (What the Python Script Will Do)**\n\n1.  Read the street length, *l*, and the number of lanterns, *n*.\n2.  Read the lantern positions, *a<sub>i</sub>*.\n3.  Sort the lantern positions into `sorted_a`.\n4.  I'll initialize `max_d` to 0.0.\n5. I'll take the max of what is currently held by `max_d`, and the distance from the left edge (sorted_a[0]).\n",
