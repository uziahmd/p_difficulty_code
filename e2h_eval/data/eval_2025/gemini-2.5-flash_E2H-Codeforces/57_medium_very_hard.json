His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Finding Vasya's Best and Worst Olympiad Ranks**\n\nAlright, let's break this down.  We've got an Olympiad problem where we need to figure out the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve.  The key is that we only have the scores, not the names attached to them, so we're dealing with all possible pairings of scores from the two rounds.\n\nFirst, let's nail down the best-case scenario. To get the highest possible rank (closest to 1st place), we want Vasya to get the maximum score possible.  Since we can freely assign scores, he should get the highest scores from both rounds. We'll pick the maximum `a` and the maximum `b`, as long as the sum is at least `x`. In fact, since the guarantee says a valid pair exists, the max pair will definitely be able to be over x. No other participant can score higher than this. The jury is going to be arbitrary with ties, but Vasya can always get 1st place in the best case, and 1st place is always the best possible rank!\n\nNow, the worst-case rank is the tricky one. To make Vasya's rank as low as possible (meaning his place is as high as it can be), we need to minimize his score while still meeting the minimum point requirement, and then maximize the number of other participants who score as high as possible.\n\nWe can't just pick any score for Vasya, since all the scores for the entire contest are fixed by `a` and `b`. The challenge is to figure out the specific assignment of scores to participants that gives Vasya the worst rank. The crucial observation is to sort the scores and use a greedy strategy for each potential score that Vasya might take (must be at least `x`). For each possible sum, we have to find a corresponding point `b` such that `a` + `b` >= `x`. After selecting this point, we need to optimize for the `n-1` remaining pairings. We maximize the points for the other contestants with a paired greedy algorithm.\n\nWe iterate through all possible values of `a` as Vasya's score, then find the smallest available `b` which works. After that we must form valid pairings to maximize how many are better than Vasya. Finally, we want the count of participants who score *greater than or equal* to Vasya. The answer is this `count + 1`.\n\nThe main idea is to use a `count_ge()` function which, given a score threshold, efficiently counts the maximum number of participants who could score at least that much. To do this, sort and use a 2-pointer approach to make it faster than iterating. By using the `count_ge()` function, we will achieve the worst rank in O(n log n) time.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad, given `n` participants, a minimum total score `x` for Vasya, and two lists of `n` scores for the first and second tours. The key challenges are that participant names are not given (so we can freely pair scores from the two tours), and ties are broken arbitrarily by the jury.\n\nLet `a` be the list of scores from the first tour and `b` be the list of scores from the second tour. Both lists have `n` elements.\n\n**Best Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank (rank 1), Vasya needs to maximize his score relative to others.\nThe problem states: \"Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\" This means it is *possible* for Vasya to achieve a score of at least `x`.\nSince we can pair any `a_i` with any `b_j` (as long as all scores are used exactly once), Vasya can choose to take the highest score from tour 1, `max(a)`, and the highest score from tour 2, `max(b)`.\nLet `S_max = max(a) + max(b)`. Since `max(a) + max(b)` is the largest possible sum of any `a_i` and `b_j`, and we are guaranteed that *some* pair `a_i + b_j` is at least `x`, it must be that `S_max >= x`. Therefore, Vasya can achieve the score `S_max`.\nNo other participant can score strictly higher than `S_max`. If other participants also score `S_max`, the jury can arbitrarily assign Vasya the 1st place among them.\nThus, Vasya's best possible rank is always **1**.\n\n**Worst Possible Rank for Vasya:**\n\nTo achieve the worst possible rank, we need to:\n1. Assign Vasya a pair `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n2. Form the remaining `n-1` pairs from `A \\ {a_i}` and `B \\ {b_j}`.\n3. Maximize the number of participants who score strictly more than Vasya, and then maximize the number of participants who score equal to Vasya.\nThe worst rank will be `(number of people with score > Vasya's score) + (number of people with score = Vasya's score) + 1`.\n\nLet's sort both `a` and `b` in ascending order. `a = [a_0, ..., a_{n-1}]`, `b = [b_0, ..., b_{n-1}]`.\n\nThe crucial insight here is that we can choose *any* `a_i` and *any* `b_j` to be Vasya's scores, as long as `a_i + b_j >= x`. To make Vasya's rank as bad as possible, we should try to make his score `S_V = a_i + b_j` as small as possible, while still satisfying `S_V >= x`.\nHowever, we also need to consider the scores of the other `n-1` participants. If Vasya takes `a_i` and `b_j`, the remaining `n-1` participants will be paired from `A \\ {a_i}` and `B \\ {b_j}`. To maximize their scores, we should pair the largest available `a` with the largest available `b`, the second largest available `a` with the second largest available `b`, and so on.\n\nThis approach of trying all `a_i` and `b_j` for Vasya and then forming other pairs is too slow (`O(N^2 log N)` or `O(N^2)`). We need a more efficient method.\n\nConsider a fixed score `S` that Vasya might achieve. We want to find the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) who can score *at least* `S`. Let this count be `k`. If Vasya scores `S` and `k` people score `S` or more, then Vasya's worst rank could be `k`. We are looking for the maximum possible `k` that can be achieved when Vasya's score `S_V >= x`.\n\nTo find the maximum number of pairs `(a_p, b_q)` such that `a_p + b_q >= S_threshold`:\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order.\n3. Use a two-pointer approach:\n   Initialize `count = 0`.\n   Initialize `ptr_b = n-1` (pointing to the largest `b` score).\n   For `ptr_a` from `0` to `n-1` (iterating through `a` from smallest to largest):\n     While `ptr_b >= 0` and `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= S_threshold`:\n       `ptr_b--`\n     If `ptr_b < 0`:\n       This means all remaining `b` values (and potentially some already used ones) could form a pair with `a[ptr_a]` or smaller `a` values to reach `S_threshold`. We have `n - (ptr_a)` `a` values and `n - (ptr_b + 1)` `b` values that could potentially form pairs. The remaining `n - ptr_a` `a` values can be paired with the `n - (ptr_b + 1)` `b` values that satisfied the condition. The number of additional pairs is `min(n - ptr_a, n - (ptr_b + 1))`.\n       This greedy strategy is a bit subtle. The most efficient way to maximize pairs `(a_p, b_q)` with `a_p + b_q >= S_threshold` is:\n       Initialize `count = 0`.\n       Initialize `j = n-1` (pointer for `b`, starting from largest).\n       For `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`, starting from smallest):\n         While `j >= 0` and `a[i] + b[j] >= S_threshold`:\n           `j--`\n         If `j < 0`: break.\n         Now, `b[j+1]` is the smallest `b` such that `a[i] + b[j+1] >= S_threshold`.\n         We have `i` elements from `a` used and `j+1` elements from `b` used.\n         The number of pairs that can be formed is `i+1` (from `a`) and `n-(j+1)` (from `b`).\n         This is also incorrect. This is for a different problem.\n\nThe correct greedy strategy to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= S_threshold` is:\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order.\n3. Initialize `count = 0`.\n4. Initialize `ptr_b = n-1` (pointer for `b`, starting from largest).\n5. For `ptr_a` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`, starting from smallest):\n   If `ptr_b < 0`: break (no more `b` values available).\n   While `ptr_b >= 0` and `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= S_threshold`:\n     `ptr_b--`\n   // At this point, `b[ptr_b+1]` is the smallest `b` value from the remaining `b`'s (i.e. `b[0...ptr_b]` and `b[ptr_b+1...n-1]`) that when paired with `a[ptr_a]` would satisfy the condition.\n   // No, this is not right.\n   The correct greedy approach is:\n   `count = 0`\n   `j = 0` (pointer for `b`)\n   For `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`):\n     While `j < n` and `b[j] < S_threshold - a[i]`:\n       `j++`\n     If `j < n`: // Found a `b[j]` such that `a[i] + b[j] >= S_threshold`\n       `count++`\n       `j++` // Move to the next `b` for the next `a`\n     Else: // No more `b` values can satisfy the condition for `a[i]` or subsequent `a` values\n       Break\n   This `count_ge(S_threshold)` function runs in `O(N)`.\n\nWe want to find the maximum `k = count_ge(S_V)` over all possible `S_V` that Vasya could obtain, where `S_V >= x`.\nThe possible values for `S_V` are `a_i + b_j`. There are `N^2` such sums. We can't iterate through them all.\nHowever, we are looking for the maximum `k`. The function `count_ge(S_threshold)` is monotonically non-increasing with `S_threshold`. This means if `S_threshold_1 < S_threshold_2`, then `count_ge(S_threshold_1) >= count_ge(S_threshold_2)`.\nWe need to find the maximum `count_ge(S_threshold)` such that `S_threshold >= x`.\nSince `count_ge` is non-increasing, the maximum value will be achieved at the smallest possible `S_threshold` that Vasya can achieve, which is `x`.\nSo, the maximum number of people who can score at least `S_V` (where `S_V >= x`) is `count_ge(x)`.\n\nLet `k = count_ge(x)`. This `k` is the maximum number of participants who can be assigned pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that their sum is at least `x`.\nIn the worst-case scenario for Vasya, we assume that Vasya is one of these `k` participants, and the jury places him last among them.\nSo, his worst rank would be `k`.\n\nLet's verify this.\nSuppose `count_ge(x)` is `k`. This means we can form `k` pairs `(a_p, b_q)` such that `a_p + b_q >= x`.\nWe can assign one of these `k` pairs to Vasya, say `(a_V, b_V)` such that `a_V + b_V >= x`.\nThe remaining `k-1` participants can also get scores `>= x`.\nThe remaining `n-k` participants will get scores `< x`.\nIn this scenario, `k` people score at least `x`. Vasya is one of them. The jury can place Vasya last among these `k` people. So his rank would be `k`.\n\nExample walk-through:\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\nSorted `a`: `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\nSorted `b`: `[0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\nCalculate `count_ge(x=7)`:\n`ptr_a = 0` (`a[0]=3`)\n`ptr_b = 0` (`b[0]=0`)\n`j` (pointer for `b`) starts at `0`.\n`i` (pointer for `a`) starts at `0`.\n\n`i=0, a[0]=3`:\n  `j=0, b[0]=0`. `b[0] < 7-3=4`. `j++` -> `j=1`.\n  `j=1, b[1]=3`. `b[1] < 7-3=4`. `j++` -> `j=2`.\n  `j=2, b[2]=4`. `b[2] >= 7-3=4`. Found a pair `(a[0], b[2])`. `count=1`. `j++` -> `j=3`.\n`i=1, a[1]=4`:\n  `j=3, b[3]=4`. `b[3] >= 7-4=3`. Found a pair `(a[1], b[3])`. `count=2`. `j++` -> `j=4`.\n`i=2, a[2]=4`:\n  `j=4, b[4]=6`. `b[4] >= 7-4=3`. Found a pair `(a[2], b[4])`. `count=3`. `j++` -> `j=5`.\n`i=3, a[3]=4`:\n  `j=5, b[5]=8`. `b[5] >= 7-4=3`. Found a pair `(a[3], b[5])`. `count=4`. `j++` -> `j=6`.\n`i=4, a[4]=5`:\n  `j=6`. `j < n` is false. Break.\n\nSo, `count_ge(7) = 4`.\nThis means up to 4 participants can score at least 7 points. Vasya could be one of them, and the jury could place him last among these 4.\nThus, Vasya's worst rank is 4.\n\nWait, the example output is `1 5`. My `count_ge(7)` is 4. Why is the example output 5?\nThe example output implies that 5 people could score at least `x`.\nLet's re-evaluate the `count_ge(S_threshold)` function.\nThe problem is to find maximum `k` such that there exists a perfect matching `M` for `A'` and `B'` (subsets of `A` and `B` of size `k`) such that all `k` sums are `>= S_threshold`.\nThis is exactly what the greedy algorithm `count_ge` computes.\n\nLet's trace the example `n=6, x=7` carefully for `count_ge(7)`:\n`a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`b = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n\n`count = 0`\n`j = 0`\n\n`i = 0, a[0] = 3`:\n  `j = 0, b[0] = 0`. `3 + 0 = 3 < 7`. `j` becomes `1`.\n  `j = 1, b[1] = 3`. `3 + 3 = 6 < 7`. `j` becomes `2`.\n  `j = 2, b[2] = 4`. `3 + 4 = 7 >= 7`. Match `(a[0], b[2])`. `count` becomes `1`. `j` becomes `3`.\n`i = 1, a[1] = 4`:\n  `j = 3, b[3] = 4`. `4 + 4 = 8 >= 7`. Match `(a[1], b[3])`. `count` becomes `2`. `j` becomes `4`.\n`i = 2, a[2] = 4`:\n  `j = 4, b[4] = 6`. `4 + 6 = 10 >= 7`. Match `(a[2], b[4])`. `count` becomes `3`. `j` becomes `5`.\n`i = 3, a[3] = 4`:\n  `j = 5, b[5] = 8`. `4 + 8 = 12 >= 7`. Match `(a[3], b[5])`. `count` becomes `4`. `j` becomes `6`.\n`i = 4, a[4] = 5`:\n  `j = 6`. `j < n` is false. Break.\n\nThe `count_ge(7)` is indeed 4.\nWhy does the example say 5?\nThe example explanation for worst case: \"{4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}\".\nThe scores are: `12, 10, 10, 9, 7, 3`.\nVasya gets 4 (from tour 1) and 3 (from tour 2), total 7.\nThe scores `12, 10, 10, 9, 7` are all `>= 7`. There are 5 such scores. Vasya is among them, so he gets 5th place.\nThis means my `count_ge` is wrong.\n\nThe example uses scores `(4,8), (4,6), (6,4), (5,4), (4,3), (3,0)`.\nLet's check the inputs used for `a` and `b` for this specific matching:\n`a_used = {4, 4, 6, 5, 4, 3}` (which is `[3,4,4,4,5,6]` sorted)\n`b_used = {8, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0}` (which is `[0,3,4,4,6,8]` sorted)\nThis is a valid matching.\n\nThe sums are:\n`4+8=12`\n`4+6=10`\n`6+4=10`\n`5+4=9`\n`4+3=7`\n`3+0=3`\n\nScores: `[12, 10, 10, 9, 7, 3]`.\nIf Vasya gets `4+3=7`, then there are 5 participants (including Vasya) who score `>= 7`. His rank is 5.\nThis means `count_ge(7)` should be 5.\n\nMy `count_ge` algorithm:\n`count = 0`\n`j = 0` (pointer for `b`)\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`):\n  While `j < n` and `b[j] < S_threshold - a[i]`:\n    `j++`\n  If `j < n`:\n    `count++`\n    `j++`\n  Else:\n    Break\n\nLet's trace it again carefully with `a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]` and `b = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`, `S_threshold = 7`.\n`count = 0`, `j = 0`\n\n`i=0, a[0]=3`:\n  `j=0, b[0]=0`. `0 < 7-3=4`. `j=1`.\n  `j=1, b[1]=3`. `3 < 7-3=4`. `j=2`.\n  `j=2, b[2]=4`. `4 >= 7-3=4`. Match `(a[0], b[2])`. `count=1`. `j=3`.\n`i=1, a[1]=4`:\n  `j=3, b[3]=4`. `4 >= 7-4=3`. Match `(a[1], b[3])`. `count=2`. `j=4`.\n`i=2, a[2]=4`:\n  `j=4, b[4]=6`. `6 >= 7-4=3`.

Break.\n\nThe algorithm still gives 4. The problem is that this greedy algorithm for maximum matching is correct for `a_i + b_j >= S_threshold` if we want to find the maximum number of pairs.\nThe example output for worst case is 5. This implies there is a way to form 5 pairs that sum to at least `x`.\nThe example matching used `(3,0)`, `(4,3)`, `(4,4)`, `(5,4)`, `(6,4)`, `(4,8)` to form the scores.\nThe `a` values used are `3,4,4,5,6,4`. The `b` values used are `0,3,4,4,4,8`. These are permutations of the input `a` and `b`.\nThe pairing in the example is not `a_i` with `b_j` where `i` and `j` are increasing.\nIt's `a[0]` with `b[2]`, `a[1]` with `b[1]`, `a[2]` with `b[3]`, `a[3]` with `b[0]`, `a[4]` with `b[4]`, `a[5]` with `b[5]` if we use sorted `a` and `b`.\nNo, the example pairing is:\n`a_vals = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]` (original `a`)\n`b_vals = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]` (original `b`)\nThe example matching is `(4,8), (6,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,3), (5,0)`.\nThis uses `a` values: `4,6,3,4,4,5` (permutation of `a`)\nThis uses `b` values: `8,4,6,4,3,0` (permutation of `b`)\nAll these sums are `12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 5`.\nFor `x=7`, the scores `>=7` are `12, 10, 9, 8, 7`. There are 5 such scores.\nSo, the `count_ge(x)` should indeed be 5.\n\nThe greedy algorithm for `count_ge(S_threshold)` is:\nSort `a` ascending. Sort `b` ascending.\n`count = 0`\n`j = n-1` (pointer for `b`, starting from largest)\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`, starting from smallest):\n  If `j < 0`: break\n  While `j >= 0` and `a[i] + b[j] >= S_threshold`:\n    `j--`\n  // `b[j+1]` is the smallest `b` that can be paired with `a[i]` to satisfy the condition.\n  // We need to match `a[i]` with `b[j+1]` to save larger `b`s for larger `a`s.\n  // This is for minimum sum.\n  // To maximize number of pairs `a_i + b_j >= S_threshold`:\n  // Sort `a` ascending.

No match.\n  `j` is `0`, so we cannot decrement `j` further.\n  We cannot match `a[5]=6` with `b[0]=0` because sum is `6 < 7`.\n  The `if a[i] + b[j] >= S_threshold` condition fails.\n  So `count` remains 5.\n\nThis greedy algorithm `count_ge(S_threshold)` gives 5 for `x=7`. This matches the example output!\nThis algorithm pairs the smallest `a_i` with the largest available `b_j` if their sum is `>= S_threshold`. If not, `a_i` cannot be paired with `b_j` (largest available `b_j`) to meet the threshold, so `a_i` cannot be used to form such a pair and we effectively discard it by moving `i` forward. This is incorrect.\n\nThe correct greedy algorithm for `count_ge(S_threshold)`:\nSort `a` ascending. Sort `b` ascending.\n`count = 0`\n`j = n-1` (pointer for `b`, starting from largest)\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`, starting from smallest):\n  If `j < 0`: break\n  If `a[i] + b[j] >= S_threshold`:\n    `count++`\n    `j--`\n  // If `a[i] + b[j] < S_threshold`, then `a[i]` is too small to be paired with `b[j]` (the largest available `b`)\n  // to reach the threshold. So `a[i]` cannot be part of any pair that reaches the threshold.\n  // We effectively discard `a[i]` and move to `a[i+1]`. `j` is NOT decremented.\nThis is the algorithm I just traced. It gives 5. This is the correct one.\n\nFinal logic:\n1. **Best Rank:** Always 1. Vasya can take `max(a)` and `max(b)`. This sum will be `>= x`. No one can score higher. Jury can assign 1st place in case of ties.\n2. **Worst Rank:**\n   a. Sort `a` and `b` in ascending order.\n   b. Calculate `k = count_ge(x)` using the refined greedy algorithm:\n      `count = 0`\n      `j = n-1` (pointer for `b`, starting from largest)\n      For `i` from `0` to `n-1` (pointer for `a`, starting from smallest):\n        If `j < 0`: break\n        If `a[i] + b[j] >= x`:\n          `count++`\n          `j--`\n        // Else, `a[i]` is too small even for `b[j]`. So `a[i]` cannot be matched to make `x`.\n        // We implicitly move to `a[i+1]` without consuming a `b`.\n   c. The worst rank is `k`.\n\nThis approach is `O(N log N)` due to sorting, and `O(N)` for `count_ge`. Total `O(N log N)`.\n`N = 10^5`, `N log N` is feasible.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best possible rank\n    # Vasya can choose the highest score from tour 1 and highest from tour 2.\n    # The problem guarantees that some a_i + b_j >= x.\n    # Since max(a) + max(b) is the largest possible sum, it must be >= x.\n    # No one can score strictly higher than max(a) + max(b).\n    # If others tie, Vasya can be awarded 1st place due to arbitrary tie-breaking.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst possible rank\n    # To find the worst rank, we want to maximize the number of people who score\n    # at least x points (including Vasya).
