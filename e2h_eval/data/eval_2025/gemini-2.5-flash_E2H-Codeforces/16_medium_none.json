Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My thought process here was quite straightforward, focusing on the core concept and simplifying the problem.** The \"Crazy Town\" problem initially seemed complex, with roads dividing a plane into blocks and needing to find the shortest path. I quickly realized I didn't need to explicitly construct a graph of blocks. Instead, I honed in on what a \"step\" actually means: crossing a road. The movement rule \"common border of nonzero length\" felt a bit wordy, but I understood it as crossing a line segment.\n\nMy first thought was, how can I determine if moving from home to the university *requires* crossing a particular road? That's when I had the critical insight: *the only time you need to cross a line is if the home and university are on opposite sides of it.* This made the problem significantly easier.\n\nI remembered the line equation `ax + by + c = 0` and how you can evaluate `f(x, y) = ax + by + c` to see where a point lies relative to the line. If `f(x, y)` has a different sign for the home and university, they're on opposite sides, and we *must* cross that line. If the signs are the same, we *could* cross, but we don't *need* to.\n\nI formulated this in terms of the product of the line function's values for home and university. If the product is negative, they're on opposite sides, and we count it as a \"step\". I also considered the edge cases where home or university might be *on* a road, but the problem's constraints guaranteed they wouldn't be, so this simplified the checking.\n\nThe math was relatively easy: it's just a matter of evaluating the line equation for the home and university coordinates, calculating the product, and counting the negative results.\n\nThe key to the solution lay in this: By focusing on whether a road *must* be crossed, I transformed a potentially complex shortest-path problem into a simple counting problem. It was important to quickly look at the examples, which helped me confirm my logic was correct.\n\nI also thought about implementation and data types. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handled potential overflows of products without needing to worry too much about. This further reinforced Python as a good choice for solving.\n\nI did a final review of the constraints to be sure, and I felt confident. It was really a matter of breaking down the concept of a \"step\" to its core and using a bit of geometric reasoning to arrive at a much simpler method. The code was simple to write. Now, I should submit it and move on.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing home) to a target block (containing university). A \"step\" is defined as moving from one block to another if they share a common border of non-zero length. This means crossing one of the infinite line roads.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nConsider any single road defined by the equation `a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0`. This road divides the plane into two half-planes.\nLet's evaluate the expression `F(x, y) = a_i x + b_i y + c_i` for a given point `(x, y)`.\n*   If `F(x, y) > 0`, the point is on one side of the line.\n*   If `F(x, y) < 0`, the point is on the other side.\n*   If `F(x, y) = 0`, the point is on the line itself.\n\nThe problem guarantees that neither your home `(x_1, y_1)` nor the university `(x_2, y_2)` lies on any road. This means for any road `i`, `F(x_1, y_1)` and `F(x_2, y_2)` will never be zero.\n\nIf your home `(x_1, y_1)` and the university `(x_2, y_2)` are on **opposite sides** of a road `i`, then any continuous path from your home to the university *must* cross road `i` at least once. Crossing a road counts as one step.\nIf your home `(x_1, y_1)` and the university `(x_2, y_2)` are on the **same side** of a road `i`, then it is possible to travel from home to university without crossing road `i`. To find the minimum number of steps, we should avoid crossing such roads.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of steps required is simply the count of roads `i` for which `(x_1, y_1)` and `(x_2, y_2)` lie on opposite sides.\n\n**How to check if two points are on opposite sides of a line:**\nTwo points `P_1=(x_1, y_1)` and `P_2=(x_2, y_2)` are on opposite sides of a line `ax + by + c = 0` if and only if `(a x_1 + b y_1 + c)` and `(a x_2 + b y_2 + c)` have opposite signs.\nThis can be checked by multiplying the two values: if their product `(a x_1 + b y_1 + c) * (a x_2 + b y_2 + c)` is negative, they are on opposite sides. Since neither point is on the line, the values will never be zero, so this check is robust.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the coordinates of your home `(x_1, y_1)`.\n2.  Read the coordinates of the university `(x_2, y_2)`.\n3.  Read the number of roads `n`.\n4.  Initialize a counter `crossings = 0`.\n5.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read the coefficients `a, b, c` for the current road.\n    b.  Calculate `val_home = a * x_1 + b * y_1 + c`.\n    c.  Calculate `val_univ = a * x_2 + b * y_2 + c`.\n    d.  If `val_home * val_univ < 0`, increment `crossings`.\n6.  Print the final value of `crossings`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Example 1):**\nHome: (1, 1)\nUniversity: (-1, -1)\nRoads:\n1.  `0x + 1y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `y = 0`)\n2.  `1x + 0y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `x = 0`)\n\n*   **Road 1 (`0x + 1y + 0 = 0`):**\n    *   `val_home = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   `val_univ = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n    *   `val_home * val_univ = 1 * (-1) = -1`. Since this is negative, home and university are on opposite sides. `crossings = 1`.\n\n*   **Road 2 (`1x + 0y + 0 = 0`):**\n    *   `val_home = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   `val_univ = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n    *   `val_home * val_univ = 1 * (-1) = -1`. Since this is negative, home and university are on opposite sides. `crossings = 2`.\n\nThe total minimum steps is 2.\n\n**Computational Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of roads. For each road, we perform a constant number of arithmetic operations. Given N <= 300, this is very efficient.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only store a few variables.\n\n**Integer Overflow:**\nThe coordinates and coefficients can be up to `10^6`.\n`a*x` or `b*y` can be up to `10^6 * 10^6 = 10^12`.\n`a*x + b*y + c` can be approximately `2 * 10^12`.\nThe product `val_home * val_univ` can be up to `(2 * 10^12) * (2 * 10^12) = 4 * 10^24`.\nPython's arbitrary-precision integers handle such large numbers automatically, so there is no risk of overflow.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read the number of roads\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    crossings = 0\n    # Iterate through each road\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Read coefficients for the current road (ax + by + c = 0)\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for the home coordinates\n        # This value indicates which side of the line (x1, y1) lies on.\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for the university coordinates\n        # This value indicates which side of the line (x2, y2) lies on.\n        val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If val_home and val_univ have different signs, it means home and university\n        # are on opposite sides of this line.\n        # Since it's guaranteed that neither home nor university lies on any road,\n        # val_home and val_univ will never be zero.\n        # Therefore, checking if their product is negative is a reliable way\n        # to determine if they are on opposite sides.\n        if val_home * val_univ < 0:\n            crossings += 1\n            \n    # Print the total number of lines that must be crossed\n    print(crossings)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
