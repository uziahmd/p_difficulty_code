    "thought": "**Understanding the Ternary String Minimization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this interesting problem. The goal is to take a ternary string (made up of 0s, 1s, and 2s) and rearrange it to be lexicographically the smallest possible, given some specific rules for what swaps are allowed. I immediately see the classic lexicographical ordering - I want as many '0's as possible at the front, followed by '1's, and then finally '2's.\n\nThe allowed swaps are crucial.  I can swap a '0' and a '1', and also a '1' and a '2'. But, significantly, I *can't* directly swap a '0' and a '2'. This is the core constraint that immediately captures my attention.  Analyzing these allowed moves, I realize '0's can essentially \"slide past\" 1s to the left and 1s can \"slide past\" 0s to the right, and similarly for 1s and 2s. The key is how the '0' and '2' interact, which can’t. This is where the real trick lies.\n\nThis is the central insight: Because '0's and '2's can *never* directly swap, their relative order is fixed. If a '0' appears to the left of a '2' in the original string, it must always remain to the left. The same for the other order. Any '1's between them are simply \"bridge characters\" that can move around, but the 0-2 relative placement is immutable.\n\nSo, I start thinking in terms of the counts: how many '0's, '1's, and '2's are there? If swaps weren't limited, the smallest string would just be count0 zeros, then count1 ones, then count2 twos. But the 0-2 restriction throws a wrench into this. The '0's and '2's have to respect their original relative order.  If I consider the original sequence, stripping out the 1's, that sequence of 0's and 2's has to be *maintained*. That's the key. This invariant is my handle on the problem. I now have the framework to approach a solution based on preserving this order while arranging the string to be the smallest lexicographically.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0' and '1' characters, or adjacent '1' and '2' characters. We cannot swap '0' and '2'.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' can swap with '1': This means '0's and '1's can move past each other.\n2. '1' can swap with '2': This means '1's and '2's can move past each other.\n\nThe crucial restriction is that '0' cannot swap with '2'. This implies that the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed. If an original string has a '0' at index `i` and a '2' at index `j`, and `i < j`, then the '0' must always appear before the '2' in any reachable string. Conversely, if `i > j`, the '0' must always appear after the '2'.\n\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by '1's, then '2's.\n\nConsider the '1's:\nA '1' can move past any '0' (to its left or right).\nA '1' can move past any '2' (to its left or right).\nThis means that '1's are \"freely movable\" with respect to both '0's and '2's. They can essentially be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's, as long as the relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved.\n\nSince '1's can move freely, to make the string lexicographically smallest, we should place all '1's after all '0's and before all '2's that they can pass.\n\nLet's count the total number of '1's in the string. Let this be `count1`.\nThe '0's and '2's effectively form a \"backbone\" whose relative order cannot change. Any '1's can be inserted anywhere into this backbone.\n\nTo get the lexicographically smallest string:\n1. All '0's should come first.\n2. Then all '1's.\n3. Then all '2's.\n\nThe only constraint preventing this ideal order is the '0' and '2' non-swap rule.\nIf we have a '2' that appears before a '0' in the original string, that '2' must remain before that '0' in the final string. This means we cannot simply collect all '0's, then all '1's, then all '2's.\n\nHowever, consider the '1's. Since they can move past both '0's and '2's, they can be collected together. Where should they be placed? To minimize the string lexicographically, '1's should come after '0's.\n\nLet's build the resulting string:\n1. Iterate through the input string `s`.\n2. Collect all '0's and append them to the result string.\n3. Collect all '2's and append them to the result string.\n4. Count all '1's.\n5. The '1's should be placed after all '0's that appear before any '2's, and before all '2's that appear after any '0's.\n   More simply, the '1's should be placed at the first position where a '2' appears in the original string. This is because all '0's can move to the left of this '2' (unless they are blocked by another '2' further left), and all '1's can move to the left of this '2'.\n   So, we should print all '0's first, then all '1's, then all '2's.\n\nThis logic is flawed. Let's re-evaluate the \"fixed relative order of '0's and '2's\".\nThe '0's and '2's form a subsequence. For example, in \"010210\", the subsequence of '0's and '2's is \"0020\". This subsequence must be preserved.\nAll '1's can be moved past any '0's or '2's. This means all '1's can be effectively \"removed\" from the string, then re-inserted anywhere.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest:\n- We want to put all '0's first.\n- Then all '1's.\n- Then all '2's.\n\nLet's count the number of '1's in the entire string. Let this be `num_ones`.\nNow, construct a new string `s_prime` by removing all '1's from `s`.\n`s_prime` will only contain '0's and '2's. For example, if `s = \"100210\"`, `s_prime = \"0020\"`.\nThe relative order of characters in `s_prime` *must* be preserved.\nWe want to insert `num_ones` '1's into `s_prime` to make the resulting string lexicographically smallest.\nTo do this, we should insert all `num_ones` '1's at the *earliest possible position* that maintains lexicographical minimality.\nThis position is right before the *first occurrence of '2'* in `s_prime`. If there are no '2's in `s_prime`, then all '1's should be appended at the end of `s_prime`.\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. Count '1's: `num_ones = 2`.\n2. Create `s_prime` by removing '1's: `s_prime = \"0020\"`.\n3. Find the first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 2 (`s_prime[2]`).\n4. Insert `num_ones` '1's at this position:\n   `s_prime_prefix = \"00\"`\n   `s_prime_suffix = \"20\"`\n   Result: `\"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\"`.\n\nExample: `s = \"11222121\"`\n1. Count '1's: `num_ones = 4`.\n2. Create `s_prime` by removing '1's: `s_prime = \"2222\"`.\n3. Find the first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 0 (`s_prime[0]`).\n4. Insert `num_ones` '1's at this position:\n   `s_prime_prefix = \"\"`\n   `s_prime_suffix = \"2222\"`\n   Result: `\"\" + \"1111\" + \"2222\" = \"11112222\"`.\n\nExample: `s = \"20\"`\n1. Count '1's: `num_ones = 0`.\n2. Create `s_prime` by removing '1's: `s_prime = \"20\"`.\n3. Find the first '2' in `s_prime`. It's at index 0 (`s_prime[0]`).\n4. Insert `num_ones` '1's at this position:\n   `s_prime_prefix = \"\"`\n   `s_prime_suffix = \"20\"`\n   Result: `\"\" + \"\" + \"20\" = \"20\"`.\n\nThis logic seems correct. It places all '0's that are originally before any '2's as far left as possible, then all '1's, then the remaining '0's and '2's in their fixed relative order.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize an empty list `result_chars`.\n2. Initialize `num_ones = 0`.\n3. Iterate through the input string `s`.\n   - If `char == '0'`, append '0' to `result_chars`.\n   - If `char == '1'`, increment `num_ones`.\n   - If `char == '2'`, append '2' to `result_chars`.\n4. Find the first index `insert_idx` in `result_chars` where a '2' appears.\n   - If no '2' is found, `insert_idx` will be `len(result_chars)`.\n5. Convert `result_chars` to a string.\n6. Insert `num_ones` '1's into this string at `insert_idx`.\n   `final_string = \"\".join(result_chars[:insert_idx]) + '1' * num_ones + \"\".join(result_chars[insert_idx:])`\n7. Print `final_string`.\n\nLet's test with an edge case: `s = \"000\"`\n1. `num_ones = 0`.\n2. `result_chars = ['0', '0', '0']`.\n3. No '2' in `result_chars`. `insert_idx = 3`.\n4. `final_string = \"000\" + \"\" + \"\" = \"000\"`. Correct.\n\nThis approach works because '1's are effectively \"transparent\" to the relative ordering of '0's and '2's. We can remove them, arrange the '0's and '2's according to their fixed relative order (which is already done by just collecting them), and then insert all the '1's at the optimal position. The optimal position for '1's is after all '0's and before all '2's. If there are no '2's, they go at the end. If there are no '0's, they go at the beginning (before the first '2').\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # result_chars will store '0's and '2's in their original relative order\n    # num_ones will count all '1's\n    result_chars = []\n    num_ones = 0\n\n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '0':\n            result_chars.append('0')\n        elif char_s == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        elif char_s == '2':\n            result_chars.append('2')\n\n    # Find the insertion point for '1's\n    # '1's should be placed after all '0's and before all '2's\n    # This means finding the first '2' in the result_chars list\n    insert_idx = len(result_chars) # Default to end if no '2' is found\n    for i in range(len(result_chars)):\n        if result_chars[i] == '2':\n            insert_idx = i\n            break\n    \n    # Construct the final string\n    # Part before '1's: '0's that appeared before the first '2'\n    # '1's: all collected '1's\n    # Part after '1's: '2's and '0's that appeared after the first '2'\n    # (or all '0's and '2's if no '2' was found)\n    final_string_parts = []\n    final_string_parts.append(\"\".join(result_chars[:insert_idx]))\n    final_string_parts.append('1' * num_ones)\n    final_string_parts.append(\"\".join(result_chars[insert_idx:]))\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\".join(final_string_parts) + '\\n')\n\n# The problem states \"The first line of the input contains the string s\".\n# This implies a single string per run, not multiple test cases.\n# However, the example input shows multiple strings.\n# Assuming the example input format is for multiple test cases,\n# and the problem statement's \"The first line\" means \"The first line of *each* input\".\n# If it's truly a single string, the loop for multiple test cases should be removed.\n# Given competitive programming context, it's safer to assume multiple test cases\n# if the example shows multiple inputs.
