    "thought": "**Breaking Down \"A Twisty Movement\" - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"A Twisty Movement,\" and it's all about finding the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing a segment of a sequence. The sequence is nice and simple, just 1s and 2s, but the reversing part adds a layer of complexity.\n\n**Understanding the Core Problem:**\n\nEssentially, I'm given a sequence 'a' of 1s and 2s, and I need to pick a portion of it, from index 'l' to 'r', and flip it around. After the flip, I want to find the longest possible non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the *new* sequence. The goal is to figure out the best 'l' and 'r' to maximize this LNDS. The length of the sequence, 'n', is up to 2000, which means an O(N^2) solution is probably what I'm aiming for. An O(N^3) solution might be too slow.\n\n**Key Insight: LNDS with Only 1s and 2s**\n\nHere's the crucial observation: With just 1s and 2s, the LNDS is always going to be a combination of some 1s, followed by some 2s. It'll never be mixed up like '2, 1'. So, finding the optimal LNDS means finding the split point: where to take all the 1s and where to start taking all the 2s.\n\n**My Solution Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Iterate Through Reversals:** I'll have to iterate through all possible segments I can reverse, since there are O(N^2) such choices: each 'l' and 'r'.\n\n2.  **Generate the New Sequence:** For each segment 'l' and 'r', I'll create the new sequence 'b' by reversing the chosen subsegment in 'a'. This can be done in O(N).\n\n3.  **Calculate the LNDS:** Now, for the new sequence 'b', I'll find the LNDS.  Here's how:\n    *   Iterate through each possible split point 'k' within 'b'. For each 'k', the LNDS will be:\n        *   All the 1s from the start of 'b' up to index 'k'\n        *   All the 2s from index 'k+1' to the end of 'b'.\n        *   Find the maximum count of these by counting the 1s and 2s.\n    *   The split point that gives the maximum count is the LNDS. Finding the LNDS will take O(N).\n\n4.  **Maximize the Result:** Keep track of the maximum LNDS found across all possible reversals.\n\nThe overall time complexity should be O(N^2) * O(N) = O(N^3). It might be possible to get it down to O(N^2) if I'm careful with calculating the LNDS. I'll need to double-check my calculations to confirm the time complexity. Let's start coding this up.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence after reversing a chosen subsegment `[l, r]` of the original sequence `a`. The sequence `a` consists only of 1s and 2s.\n\n**Key Observation about LNDS with 1s and 2s:**\nA non-decreasing subsequence in a sequence of 1s and 2s must be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. It cannot have a 2 followed by a 1.\nThis means that an optimal non-decreasing subsequence can be constructed by picking all 1s up to some point, and all 2s from some point onwards.\nMore precisely, if we consider any split point `k` in the array (meaning elements up to index `k` are considered for 1s, and elements after index `k` are considered for 2s), the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence passing through this split point would be `(count of 1s in a[0...k]) + (count of 2s in a[k+1...n-1])`.\nThe overall LNDS length for a sequence `b` is the maximum of this sum over all possible split points `k` from `-1` to `n-1` (where `k=-1` means all 2s, and `k=n-1` means all 1s).\n\n**Algorithm:**\nSince `n` is up to 2000, an `O(N^2)` solution is feasible. There are `O(N^2)` possible intervals `[l, r]` to reverse. For each interval, we can compute the LNDS in `O(N)` time, leading to an overall `O(N^3)` solution. This might be too slow. We need a more efficient way to calculate LNDS after reversal.\n\nLet's iterate through all possible `l` and `r` (1-indexed, so `0` to `n-1` in 0-indexed terms).\nFor each pair `(l, r)`:\n1. The sequence elements `a[0...l-1]` remain unchanged.\n2. The sequence elements `a[r+1...n-1]` remain unchanged.\n3. The sequence elements `a[l...r]` are reversed.\n\nWe can calculate the LNDS by considering all possible \"split points\" `k` (0-indexed). A split point `k` means we take all 1s from `a[0...k]` and all 2s from `a[k+1...n-1]`.\nThe length for a given `k` is `count_of_1s_up_to_k + count_of_2s_after_k`.\n\nLet's precompute prefix sums for 1s and 2s in the original array:\n`pref1[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i]`\n`pref2[i]` = count of 2s in `a[0...i]`\n`suff1[i]` = count of 1s in `a[i...n-1]`\n`suff2[i]` = count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`\n\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`:\nThe LNDS length will be `max_k (count_of_1s_in_b[0...k] + count_of_2s_in_b[k+1...n-1])`.\n\nWe can iterate through all possible `l` (from `0` to `n-1`) and `r` (from `l` to `n-1`).\nFor each `(l, r)`:\nThe elements `a[0...l-1]` are fixed. The elements `a[r+1...n-1]` are fixed.\nThe elements `a[l...r]` are reversed.\nLet `b` be the array after reversal.\nThe number of 1s in `b[0...k]` can be calculated as:\n- If `k < l`: `pref1[k]`\n- If `l <= k <= r`: `pref1[l-1]` (if `l > 0`) + `(count of 1s in reversed a[l...k])`\n- If `k > r`: `pref1[l-1]` (if `l > 0`) + `(count of 1s in reversed a[l...r])` + `(count of 1s in a[r+1...k])`\n\nThis approach still seems to require iterating `k` for each `(l, r)`, which is `O(N^3)`.\n\n**Optimization:**\nInstead of iterating through `k` for each `(l, r)`, let's fix `l` and `r` and compute the LNDS more directly.\nThe LNDS is formed by 1s from the prefix, 1s from the reversed segment, 2s from the reversed segment, and 2s from the suffix.\nConsider a split point `k`.\nThe `count_of_1s_up_to_k` is:\n- `pref1[k]` if `k < l`\n- `pref1[l-1]` + `(count of 1s in a[idx] for idx in [l...k] after reversal)` if `l <= k <= r`\n- `pref1[l-1]` + `(count of 1s in a[l...r] after reversal)` + `(count of 1s in a[r+1...k])` if `k > r`\n\nThe `count_of_2s_after_k` is:\n- `suff2[k+1]` if `k < l`\n- `(count of 2s in a[idx] for idx in [k+1...r] after reversal)` + `suff2[r+1]` if `l <= k <= r`\n- `suff2[k+1]` if `k > r`\n\nThe key insight is that the LNDS will be formed by:\n- All 1s before `l`.\n- Some 1s from the reversed segment `[l, r]` (which were originally 1s or 2s).\n- Some 2s from the reversed segment `[l, r]` (which were originally 1s or 2s).\n- All 2s after `r`.\n\nLet `ones_before_l = pref1[l-1]` (0 if `l=0`).\nLet `twos_after_r = suff2[r+1]` (0 if `r=n-1`).\n\nFor the segment `a[l...r]`, after reversal, it becomes `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`.\nLet's call this reversed segment `rev_seg`.\nWe need to find the maximum `(ones_before_l + count_of_1s_in_rev_seg[0...j] + count_of_2s_in_rev_seg[j+1...r-l] + twos_after_r)` for all `j`.\nThis is equivalent to finding the LNDS of `rev_seg` and adding `ones_before_l + twos_after_r`.\n\nSo, for each `(l, r)`:\n1. Calculate `current_ones_before_l = pref1[l-1]` (handle `l=0` as 0).\n2. Calculate `current_twos_after_r = suff2[r+1]` (handle `r=n-1` as 0).\n3. Calculate the LNDS of the segment `a[l...r]` *after it's reversed*.\n   Let `seg_len = r - l + 1`.\n   We need to find `max_j (count_of_1s_in_rev_a[l...l+j] + count_of_2s_in_rev_a[l+j+1...r])`.\n   This can be calculated in `O(seg_len)` time.\n   Iterate `j` from `l-1` to `r`.\n   `count_1s_in_reversed_subsegment_up_to_j` means `count of 1s in a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l+(r-j)]`.\n   `count_2s_in_reversed_subsegment_after_j` means `count of 2s in a[l+(r-j)-1], ..., a[l]`.\n\nLet `count1_rev[x]` be the number of 1s in `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[x]`.\nLet `count2_rev[x]` be the number of 2s in `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[x]`.\nThese can be computed in `O(N)` for a fixed `l, r`.\nFor `i` from `r` down to `l`:\n  `count1_rev[i] = (a[i] == 1) + (count1_rev[i+1] if i+1 <= r else 0)`\n  `count2_rev[i] = (a[i] == 2) + (count2_rev[i+1] if i+1 <= r else 0)`\n\nThen, for `j` from `l-1` to `r`:\n  `ones_in_middle = count1_rev[j+1]` (if `j+1 <= r` else 0)\n  `twos_in_middle = count2_rev[l] - count2_rev[j+1]` (if `j+1 <= r` else `count2_rev[l]`)\n  The LNDS for the middle part is `ones_in_middle + twos_in_middle`.\n  This is `max_val = max(max_val, ones_in_middle + twos_in_middle)`.\n\nSo, for each `(l, r)`:\n1. `current_ones_before_l = (pref1[l-1] if l > 0 else 0)`\n2. `current_twos_after_r = (suff2[r+1] if r < n-1 else 0)`\n3. Calculate `max_LNDS_in_reversed_segment_a[l...r]`:\n   Initialize `max_mid_LNDS = 0`.\n   `current_1s_reversed = 0`\n   `current_2s_reversed = 0`\n   Iterate `i` from `r` down to `l`:\n     If `a[i] == 1`: `current_1s_reversed += 1`\n     Else (`a[i] == 2`): `current_2s_reversed += 1`\n     `max_mid_LNDS = max(max_mid_LNDS, current_1s_reversed + (total_2s_in_segment - current_2s_reversed))`\n     // The above line is wrong. `current_1s_reversed` counts 1s from `a[r]` down to `a[i]`.\n     // `total_2s_in_segment - current_2s_reversed` counts 2s from `a[i-1]` down to `a[l]`.\n     // This is the correct logic for calculating LNDS in a segment.\n   Initialize `max_mid_LNDS = 0`.\n   `ones_so_far_reversed = 0`\n   `total_twos_in_segment = pref2[r] - (pref2[l-1] if l > 0 else 0)`\n   For `i` from `r` down to `l`: // `i` is the current element from original array\n     // We are considering split point after `a[i]` in the reversed segment.\n     // `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[i]` are 1s, `a[i-1], ..., a[l]` are 2s.\n     if `a[i] == 1`:\n       `ones_so_far_reversed += 1`\n     `twos_remaining_reversed = total_twos_in_segment - (pref2[i] - (pref2[l-1] if l > 0 else 0))`\n     `max_mid_LNDS = max(max_mid_LNDS, ones_so_far_reversed + twos_remaining_reversed)`\n   // Also consider the case where all are 2s (no 1s from reversed segment)\n   `max_mid_LNDS = max(max_mid_LNDS, total_twos_in_segment)`\n   // Also consider the case where all are 1s (no 2s from reversed segment)\n   `max_mid_LNDS = max(max_mid_LNDS, (pref1[r] - (pref1[l-1] if l > 0 else 0)))`\n\nThe calculation of `max_mid_LNDS` for `a[l...r]` is `O(r-l+1)`.\nTotal time complexity: `sum_{l=0}^{n-1} sum_{r=l}^{n-1} (r-l+1) = O(N^3)`. This is too slow for `N=2000`. `2000^3 = 8 * 10^9`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the LNDS calculation after reversal.\nThe final LNDS is of the form `1...12...2`.\nThis means it must come from:\n1. `1`s from `a[0...l-1]`\n2. `1`s from `a[l...r]` (reversed)\n3. `2`s from `a[l...r]` (reversed)\n4. `2`s from `a[r+1...n-1]`\n\nLet `p1[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\nLet `s2[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\n`p1[0] = 0`, `s2[n] = 0`.\nThe total LNDS for a chosen `l, r` will be `p1[l] + s2[r+1] + LNDS_middle`.\n`LNDS_middle` is the LNDS of the reversed segment `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`.\n\nHow to find `LNDS_middle` efficiently?\nLet `rev_seg = [a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]]`.\n`LNDS_middle` is `max_k (count_1s_in_rev_seg[0...k] + count_2s_in_rev_seg[k+1...len-1])`.\nLet `cnt1[i]` be the count of 1s in `rev_seg[0...i]`.\nLet `cnt2[i]` be the count of 2s in `rev_seg[0...i]`.\nThen `LNDS_middle = max_k (cnt1[k] + (total_2s_in_rev_seg - cnt2[k]))`.\nThis is `O(len)` for `rev_seg`. Still `O(N^3)`.\n\nThe crucial part is that `LNDS_middle` can be calculated in `O(1)` *after* some precomputation.\nFor a fixed `l`:\nIterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\nAs `r` increases, the segment `a[l...r]` grows. When we reverse it, `a[r]` is added to the front.\nLet `current_1s_in_reversed_middle` be the count of 1s in `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`.\nLet `current_2s_in_reversed_middle` be the count of 2s in `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`.\nWhen `r` increments to `r+1`:\nThe segment `a[l...r+1]` is considered. The reversed segment is `a[r+1], a[r], ..., a[l]`.\n`a[r+1]` is now the first element.\nThis means we need to efficiently update the `max_k (cnt1[k] + (total_2s - cnt2[k]))` value.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the length of the LNDS ending at index `i` (in `rev_seg`).\nThis is not helpful because `rev_seg` changes.\n\nLet's fix the \"split point\" `k` in the original array. This split point `k` means we take 1s from `a[0...k]` and 2s from `a[k+1...n-1]`.\nIf we reverse `a[l...r]`:\nThe LNDS of the final array `b` is `max_s (count_of_1s_in_b[0...s] + count_of_2s_in_b[s+1...n-1])`.\nThis `s` can be any index from `-1` to `n-1`.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the LNDS. It's `1...12...2`.\nThe 1s can come from:\n1. `a[0...l-1]`\n2. `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[x]` for some `x` in `[l, r]`.\nThe 2s can come from:\n1. `a[x-1], ..., a[l]` for some `x` in `[l, r]`.\n2. `a[r+1...n-1]`\n\nSo, for each `l, r`, we are looking for:\n`max_{x=l-1...r} ( count_1s(a[0...l-1]) + count_1s(a[r...x+1] reversed) + count_2s(a[x...l] reversed) + count_2s(a[r+1...n-1]) )`\nNote that `count_1s(a[r...x+1] reversed)` means `count_1s(a[x+1...r])`.\nAnd `count_2s(a[x...l] reversed)` means `count_2s(a[l...x])`.\n\nSo, for each `l, r`, we want to find:\n`max_{x=l-1...r} ( p1[l] + (p1[r] - p1[x]) + (p2[x] - p2[l-1]) + s2[r+1] )`.\nHere, `p1[i]` is count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`, `p2[i]` is count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`.\nAnd `s2[i]` is count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\nLet's use 0-indexed prefix sums for simplicity.\n`P1[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i]`. `P1[-1]=0`.\n`P2[i]` = count of 2s in `a[0...i]`. `P2[-1]=0`.\n`S1[i]` = count of 1s in `a[i...n-1]`. `S1[n]=0`.\n`S2[i]` = count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`. `S2[n]=0`.\n\nFor chosen `l, r` (0-indexed):\nWe need to find `max_{x=l-1...r}` of:\n`(P1[l-1]) + (P1[r] - P1[x]) + (P2[x] - P2[l-1]) + (S2[r+1])`\n(If `l=0`, `P1[l-1]` and `P2[l-1]` are 0. If `x=l-1`, `P1[r]-P1[x]` means `P1[r]-P1[l-1]`, `P2[x]-P2[l-1]` means 0. If `x=r`, `P1[r]-P1[x]` means 0, `P2[x]-P2[l-1]` means `P2[r]-P2[l-1]`).\n\nLet's rewrite the expression:\n`P1[l-1] + P1[r] - P1[x] + P2[x] - P2[l-1] + S2[r+1]`\n`= (P1[l-1] - P2[l-1]) + P1[r] + S2[r+1] + (P2[x] - P1[x])`\n\nThis means for fixed `l, r`, we need to maximize `(P2[x] - P1[x])` for `x` in `[l-1, r]`.\nLet `val_x = P2[x] - P1[x]`.\nWe need `max_{x=l-1...r} val_x`.\nSo, for each `l, r`, we calculate:\n`P1[l-1] + P1[r] + S2[r+1] - P2[l-1] + max_{x=l-1...r}(P2[x] - P1[x])`.\n\nThis `max_{x=l-1...r}(P2[x] - P1[x])` can be computed efficiently.\nFor a fixed `l`:\nAs `r` increases from `l` to `n-1`:\nThe range `[l-1, r]` for `x` expands.\nWe can maintain `current_max_val_x = max(current_max_val_x, P2[r] - P1[r])`.\nThe initial `current_max_val_x` for `r=l` would be `max(P2[l-1]-P1[l-1], P2[l]-P1[l])`.\n(Careful with `x=l-1` vs `x=l`. `P2[-1]-P1[-1]` is `0-0=0`).\n\nDetailed Algorithm:\n1.

This is the initial `max_lnds`.)\n   Let's just initialize `max_lnds` to 0 and ensure the loop covers all cases.\n\n3.

This `x_orig` is the index in the original array `a` that is at position `k` in the modified array `b`.\nSo, `b[0...k]` consists of:\n  `a[0...l-1]` (original order)\n  `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[x_orig]` (reversed order)\n`b[k+1...n-1]` consists of:\n  `a[x_orig-1], ..., a[l]` (reversed order)\n  `a[r+1...n-1]` (original order)\n\nSo, for `l <= k <= r`:\n`count_1s_in_b[0...k] = (get_P1(l-1)) + (get_P1(r) - get_P1(x_orig-1))`\n`count_2s_in_b[k+1...n-1] = (get_P2(x_orig-1) - get_P2(l-1)) + (get_S2(r+1))`\n\nSumming them up:\n`LNDS_for_k = get_P1(l-1) + get_P1(r) - get_P1(x_orig-1) + get_P2(x_orig-1) - get_P2(l-1) + get_S2(r+1)`\n`LNDS_for_k = (get_P1(l-1) - get_P2(l-1)) + get_P1(r) + get_S2(r+1) + (get_P2(x_orig-1) - get_P1(x_orig-1))`\n\nWe need to maximize this over `k` such that `l <= k <= r`.\nThis means we need to maximize `x_orig` such that `l <= x_orig <= r`.\nSo, we need `max_{x_orig=l...r} (get_P2(x_orig-1) - get_P1(x_orig-1))`.\nLet `val_x = get_P2(x-1) - get_P1(x-1)`.\nWe need `max_{x=l...r} val_x`.\nThis is precisely the `O(N^2)` solution's core logic!\n\nLet's re-verify the range for `x_orig`.\n`k` goes from `l` to `r`.\nWhen `k=l`, `x_orig = r - (l-l) = r`.\nWhen `k=r`, `x_orig = r - (r-l) = l`.\nSo `x_orig` indeed ranges from `l` to `r`.\n\nThe `max_P2_minus_P1_in_range` variable in my `O(N^2)` algorithm should track `max(get_P2(x-1) - get_P1(x-1))` for `x` in `[l, r]`.\nLet `f(idx) = get_P2(idx-1) - get_P1(idx-1)`.\nThen for a fixed `l`, as `r` goes from `l` to `n-1`:\n`max_val_f_x_in_range = max_{x=l...r} f(x)`.\nThis can be updated in `O(1)`:\n`max_val_f_x_in_range = max(max_val_f_x_in_range, f(r))`.\nThe initial value for `max_val_f_x_in_range` when `r=l` is `f(l)`.\n\nRevised `O(N^2)` algorithm:\n1. Precompute `P1_arr`, `P2_arr`, `S2_arr`.\n   `P1_arr[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i]`. `P1_arr[-1]=0`.\n   `P2_arr[i]` = count of 2s in `a[0...i]`. `P2_arr[-1]=0`.\n   `S2_arr[i]` = count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`. `S2_arr[n]=0`.\n   Helper functions: `get_P1(idx)`, `get_P2(idx)`, `get_S2(idx)`.\n\n2. Initialize `max_lnds = 0`.\n   Calculate LNDS of original array and set `max_lnds` to that.\n   `for k in range(-1, n):`\n     `max_lnds = max(max_lnds, get_P1(k) + get_S2(k+1))`\n\n3. Iterate `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n   Initialize `max_f_x_val = -float('inf')` (or `f(l)`).\n   For `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n     `max_f_x_val = max(max_f_x_val, get_P2(r-1) - get_P1(r-1))` (This is `f(r)`).\n     `current_lnds = (get_P1(l-1) - get_P2(l-1)) + get_P1(r) + get_S2(r+1) + max_f_x_val`\n     `max_lnds = max(max_lnds, current_lnds)`\n\nThis looks correct and is `O(N^2)`.\n\nExample `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, `n=4`.\n`P1_arr = [1, 1, 2, 2]`\n`P2_arr = [0, 1, 1, 2]`\n`S2_arr = [2, 2, 1, 1]`\n\nInitial `max_lnds = 3` (from `k=0` or `k=2`).\n\n`l=0`:\n  `max_f_x_val = -float('inf')`\n  `r=0`: `x` ranges `[0,0]`. `f(0) = get_P2(-1)-get_P1(-1) = 0-0 = 0`.\n    `max_f_x_val = max(-inf, f(0)) = 0`.\n    `current_lnds = (get_P1(-1)-get_P2(-1)) + get_P1(0) + get_S2(1) + max_f_x_val`\n    `= (0-0) + 1 + 2 + 0 = 3`. `max_lnds = max(3, 3) = 3`.\n  `r=1`: `x` ranges `[0,1]`. `f(1) = get_P2(0)-get_P1(0) = 0-1 = -1`.\n    `max_f_x_val = max(0, f(1)) = max(0, -1) = 0`.\n    `current_lnds = (get_P1(-1)-get_P2(-1)) + get_P1(1) + get_S2(2) + max_f_x_val`\n    `= (0-0) + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2`. `max_lnds = max(3, 2) = 3`.\n  `r=2`: `x` ranges `[0,2]`. `f(2) = get_P2(1)-get_P1(1) = 1-1 = 0`.\n    `max_f_x_val = max(0, f(2)) = max(0, 0) = 0`.\n    `current_lnds = (0-0) + get_P1(2) + get_S2(3) + max_f_x_val`\n    `= 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 3`. `max_lnds = max(3, 3) = 3`.\n  `r=3`: `x` ranges `[0,3]`. `f(3) = get_P2(2)-get_P1(2) = 1-2 = -1`.\n    `max_f_x_val = max(0, f(3)) = max(0, -1) = 0`.\n    `current_lnds = (0-0) + get_P1(3) + get_S2(4) + max_f_x_val`\n    `= 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 2`. `max_lnds = max(3, 2) = 3`.\n\n`l=1`:\n  `max_f_x_val = -float('inf')`\n  `r=1`: `x` ranges `[1,1]`. `f(1) = get_P2(0)-get_P1(0) = 0-1 = -1`.\n    `max_f_x_val = max(-inf, f(1)) = -1`.\n    `current_lnds = (get_P1(0)-get_P2(0)) + get_P1(1) + get_S2(2) + max_f_x_val`\n    `= (1-0) + 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 2`. `max_lnds = max(3, 2) = 3`.\n  `r=2`: `x` ranges `[1,2]`. `f(2) = get_P2(1)-get_P1(1) = 1-1 = 0`.\n    `max_f_x_val = max(-1, f(2)) = max(-1, 0) = 0`.\n    `current_lnds = (get_P1(0)-get_P2(0)) + get_P1(2) + get_S2(3) + max_f_x_val`\n    `= (1-0) + 2 + 1 + 0 = 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 4`. `max_lnds = max(3, 4) = 4`.\n  `r=3`: `x` ranges `[1,3]`. `f(3) = get_P2(2)-get_P1(2) = 1-2 = -1`.\n    `max_f_x_val = max(0, f(3)) = max(0, -1) = 0`.\n    `current_lnds = (get_P1(0)-get_P2(0)) + get_P1(3) + get_S2(4) + max_f_x_val`\n    `= (1-0) + 2 + 0 + 0 = 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 3`. `max_lnds = max(4, 3) = 4`.\n\nThis `O(N^2)` solution seems to work and correctly matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # P1_arr[i] = count of 1s in a[0...i]\n    # P2_arr[i] = count of 2s in a[0...i]\n    # S2_arr[i] = count of 2s in a[i...n-1]\n\n    P1_arr = [0] * n\n    P2_arr = [0] * n\n    S2_arr = [0] * n\n\n    # Compute P1_arr and P2_arr\n    if n > 0:\n        P1_arr[0] = 1 if a[0] == 1 else 0\n        P2_arr[0] = 1 if a[0] == 2 else 0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            P1_arr[i] = P1_arr[i-1] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n            P2_arr[i] = P2_arr[i-1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n\n    # Compute S2_arr\n    if n > 0:\n        S2_arr[n-1] = 1 if a[n-1] == 2 else 0\n        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n            S2_arr[i] = S2_arr[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n\n    # Helper functions to handle out-of-bounds indices for prefix/suffix arrays\n    def get_P1(idx):\n        if idx < 0:\n            return 0\n        return P1_arr[idx]\n\n    def get_P2(idx):\n        if idx < 0:\n            return 0\n        return P2_arr[idx]\n\n    def get_S2(idx):\n        if idx >= n:\n            return 0\n        return S2_arr[idx]\n\n    max_lnds = 0\n\n    # Calculate LNDS of the original array as a baseline\n    # This corresponds to reversing an interval [i, i] (no actual change)\n    for k in range(-1, n): # k is the split point in the original array\n        max_lnds = max(max_lnds, get_P1(k) + get_S2(k+1))\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible (l, r) intervals to reverse (0-indexed)\n    for l in range(n):\n        # max_f_x_val = max_{x=l...r} (get_P2(x-1) - get_P1(x-1))\n        # This tracks the maximum value of (count of 2s before x - count of 1s before x)\n        # where x is an index in the original array a, and x-1 is the effective index for P1/P2\n        # This `x` corresponds to `x_orig` in the derivation.\n        # `x_orig` goes from `l` to `r`.
