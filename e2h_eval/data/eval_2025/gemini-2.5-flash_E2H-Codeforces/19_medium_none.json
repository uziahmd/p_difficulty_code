The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My thinking process for solving the \"The Number Games\" problem.**\n\nOkay, this problem's got a few layers. I need to maximize the sum of powers of 2 associated with the districts I *keep*, which are the ones *not* removed.  The key is that since 2^i grows exponentially, keeping larger indices is always better than keeping a bunch of smaller ones.  So the strategy is to keep as many *large-indexed* districts as possible, subject to the connectivity constraint.\n\nInitially, I thought, \"Well, if I could just keep the top *n-k* districts (those with labels n down to k+1) I'd be golden!\" but that quickly became a problem, because those might not be connected in the tree.  Drat!\n\nI then realized that this screams \"greedy approach.\"  I need to somehow build a connected subgraph, node by node, always prioritizing those with larger indices. It's like a modified DFS or BFS where the traversal order *matters*.  I should explore neighbors with larger indices first.\n\nThinking from a \"remove\" perspective seemed helpful.  If I want to maximize the \"kept\" districts, it's equivalent to minimizing the indices of the ones I remove.  So, I thought, \"Let's remove the *small* nodes to ensure that the large nodes stay connected.\" This is the core insight!\n\nThe key is figuring out *which* nodes I can remove without disconnecting the remaining graph.  A leaf node is an obvious candidate, right?  Removing a leaf always preserves connectivity. That's the key, so I started down the path of focusing on leaf nodes.\n\nI thought about starting with the node `n`, and see what the path looks like, maybe BFS and prioritize neighbors with large indices.\n\nI landed on this idea: start with all nodes, and then *iteratively* remove the smallest index leaf nodes.  The tricky part is efficiently identifying and updating the leaf nodes as the graph changes.\n\nMy algorithm would go like this:\n1.  Represent the tree as an adjacency list.\n2.  Count degrees of each node (number of neighbors).\n3.  Use a priority queue (min-heap) to hold leaf nodes based on their indices (smallest index at the top).\n4.  Remove nodes one by one *while* maintaining the priority queue so I always know the current leaf node with the *smallest* index. When remove a node, update its neighbors' degree and update the heap. If their degree becomes one, push into the heap.\n5.  I keep going until I've removed the required `k` nodes.\n\nThe core of the logic is ensuring that, *in the remaining graph* (after some nodes have been removed), I always remove the *smallest-indexed leaf node*.  It's crucial to correctly track the \"current\" degree of nodes as I remove nodes to avoid disconnectivity and avoid adding removed nodes into the heap. That way, I can correctly find `k` nodes that are removed.\n\nI've got a good plan. Now, it's time to translate this into code!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove `k` contestants (districts) such that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component in the original tree. We want to maximize the total number of fans of the remaining contestants. The number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nSince `2^i` grows exponentially with `i`, maximizing the sum `sum(2^i)` is equivalent to keeping districts with the largest possible indices. For example, `2^5` is greater than `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4`. This means we should prioritize keeping districts with higher numbers.\nConversely, to maximize the sum of `2^i` for the `n-k` kept districts, we should minimize the sum of `2^i` for the `k` removed districts. This means we should prioritize removing districts with *smaller* indices.\n\n**Algorithm:**\nWe need to remove `k` districts, prioritizing those with smaller indices, while ensuring the remaining `n-k` districts stay connected.\nA common strategy for problems involving removing nodes while maintaining connectivity in a tree is to iteratively remove leaf nodes. Removing a leaf node (a node with degree 1) from a connected graph will always leave the remaining graph connected (as long as there's more than one node left).\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Build the graph:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list. Store the current degree of each node.\n2.  **Initialize candidates for removal:** Create a min-priority queue (e.g., `heapq` in Python) to store nodes that are currently leaves (degree 1) in the graph of non-removed nodes. The priority queue should order nodes by their index (smallest index first).\n3.  **Iterative removal:** Repeat `k` times:\n    *   Extract the node `u` with the smallest index from the priority queue.\n    *   If `u` has already been marked as removed, or if its current degree is no longer 1 (meaning it's not a leaf anymore due to previous removals), skip `u` and extract the next smallest node. (This handles cases where a node was added to the heap as a leaf, but then its neighbor was removed, making it an internal node in the remaining graph, or another neighbor was removed making it a leaf again and thus potentially added to the heap multiple times).\n    *   If `u` is a valid leaf to remove (smallest index, not removed, current degree 1):\n        *   Add `u` to our list of `removed_nodes`.\n        *   Mark `u` as removed.\n        *   Decrement the `current_deg` of all its neighbors `v`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` whose `current_deg` becomes 1 (i.e., `v` becomes a leaf), add `v` to the priority queue.\n4.  **Output:** Print the `k` removed district numbers in increasing order.\n\n**Edge Case: `n-k = 1`**\nIf `n-k = 1`, it means we need to keep only one node. To maximize fans, we should keep the node with the largest index, which is `n`. All other `n-1` nodes (`1, 2, ..., n-1`) should be removed. The general algorithm naturally handles this:\n*   Nodes `1, ..., n-1` will be removed first because they have smaller indices.\n*   Eventually, only node `n` will remain, and its `current_deg` will become 0. It won't be pushed to the heap as a leaf, or if it was, it will be skipped when `current_deg[n]` becomes 0.\n*   The `k` smallest-indexed leaves will be removed until `n-1` nodes are removed, leaving `n`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Sample 1: n=6, k=3, edges from input):**\nEdges: (2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)\n\n1.  **Initial State:**\n    *   `adj`: `1:[2], 2:[1,6,4,3], 3:[2], 4:[2], 5:[6], 6:[2,5]`\n    *   `current_deg`: `1:1, 2:4, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:2`\n    *   `is_removed`: `[F,F,F,F,F,F,F]`\n    *   `heap`: `[1, 3, 4, 5]` (initial leaves)\n    *   `removed_nodes_list`: `[]`\n\n2.  **Iteration 1 (k=1):**\n    *   Pop `1` from `heap`. `1` is not removed, `current_deg[1]=1`. Valid.\n    *   `removed_nodes_list = [1]`\n    *   `is_removed[1] = T`\n    *   Neighbor of `1` is `2`. `is_removed[2]` is `F`.\n    *   `current_deg[2]` becomes `3`. (`2` is not a leaf, not added to heap).\n    *   `heap`: `[3, 4, 5]`\n\n3.  **Iteration 2 (k=2):**\n    *   Pop `3` from `heap`. `3` is not removed, `current_deg[3]=1`. Valid.\n    *   `removed_nodes_list = [1, 3]`\n    *   `is_removed[3] = T`\n    *   Neighbor of `3` is `2`. `is_removed[2]` is `F`.\n    *   `current_deg[2]` becomes `2`. (`2` is not a leaf, not added to heap).\n    *   `heap`: `[4, 5]`\n\n4.  **Iteration 3 (k=3):**\n    *   Pop `4` from `heap`. `4` is not removed, `current_deg[4]=1`. Valid.\n    *   `removed_nodes_list = [1, 3, 4]`\n    *   `is_removed[4] = T`\n    *   Neighbor of `4` is `2`. `is_removed[2]` is `F`.\n    *   `current_deg[2]` becomes `1`. (`2` is now a leaf!)\n    *   Add `2` to `heap`.\n    *   `heap`: `[2, 5]` (Heap property: `2` is smaller than `5`)\n\n5.  **`removed_count` is 3, which equals `k`. Stop.**\n\n**Output:** `1 3 4` (sorted `removed_nodes_list`). This matches the sample output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list and degrees: O(N + M) where M is number of edges. For a tree, M = N-1, so O(N).\n*   Initializing heap: O(N) for adding N elements.\n*   Main loop: Runs `k` times. In each iteration:\n    *   `heapq.heappop`: O(log N).\n    *   Iterating neighbors: Sum of degrees is 2(N-1). Each edge is processed at most twice (once for each endpoint when it's removed).\n    *   `heapq.heappush`: O(log N).\n*   Total for loop: `k * O(log N)` for heap operations. The total degree updates and neighbor iterations across all `k` removals is at most `2 * (N-1)` since each edge is considered when one of its endpoints is removed. Each `heapq.heappush` is associated with a degree becoming 1. A node's degree can become 1 multiple times, but it is added to the heap only if it *becomes* 1, not if it *stays* 1. This means a node is pushed to the heap at most `deg[i]` times. The total number of `heappush` operations is bounded by `sum(deg[i]) = 2(N-1)`.\n*   Overall complexity: O(N log N) in the worst case (e.g., a star graph where the center node has high degree). More precisely, O(N + M + k log N) which simplifies to O(N log N) for a tree.\n*   Given `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is efficient enough (`10^6 * log(10^6)` approx `10^6 * 20 = 2 * 10^7`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    current_deg = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        current_deg[u] += 1\n        current_deg[v] += 1\n\n    # Special case: if we need to keep only one node, it must be the largest index 'n'.\n    # This is implicitly handled by the general algorithm as 'n' will likely be the last to be removed,\n    # or never removed if it's not a leaf and smaller nodes are removed first.\n    # However, if n-k = 1, we must keep node 'n' and remove all others.\n    # The algorithm correctly prioritizes removing smaller indexed nodes.\n    # The only node that might have current_deg[i] == 0 initially is if n=1, but k < n.\n    # For n > 1, all nodes in a tree have current_deg >= 1.\n\n    # Priority queue stores nodes that are currently leaves, ordered by node index (smallest first).\n    min_heap = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if current_deg[i] == 1: # Initial leaves\n            heapq.heappush(min_heap, i)\n        # Handle the case of n-k = 1, where the only node left is the root of a star graph.\n        # If n > 1, no node has degree 0.
