And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Average Sleep Time Over K-Day Weeks**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the average sleep time, but with a specific twist. We're looking at consecutive \"weeks\" of *k* days, and we need the average across all these possible weeks.\n\nHere's my thinking process:\n\nFirst, I've got the inputs: `n` is the total number of days recorded, `k` is the length of each \"week,\" and `a1` through `an` are the actual sleep times for each day. The constraints are pretty standard: `k` can't be bigger than `n`, and the sleep times are within a reasonable range.\n\nNext, I need to define what a \"week\" actually is. A week starts on a particular day and includes the next *k* consecutive days. So, the first week starts on day 1, the second on day 2, and so on. The last week will start on day `n - k + 1`.\n\nFrom there, it's about figuring out how many weeks we have. It turns out there are `n - k + 1` possible weeks because of that overlapping window concept.\n\nNow, the main goal is to calculate the average sleep time across all these weeks. This means I need to:\n\n1.  Calculate the sum of sleep times for each week.\n2.  Sum up all of those weekly sums.\n3.  Divide the total sum by the number of weeks.\n\nI'm thinking of denoting the sum of sleep times for a week starting at day `i` as `S_i`, which is simply the sum of the `k` sleep times starting at day `i`. So my final calculation will be the sum of all `S_i` values, divided by `n - k + 1`.\n\nI also have an example walkthrough to make sure I understand it. Given `n = 3`, `k = 2`, and sleep times `[3, 4, 7]`, I'd have two weeks: `[3, 4]` and `[4, 7]`.  Their sums are 7 and 11, the sum of those being 18, which divided by 2 weeks yields 9.0, which matches the expected average.\n\nNow, the important part: efficiency. I've got to think about the algorithm's complexity. A straightforward, nested-loop approach would iterate through each week and then sum the sleep times within that week. This would involve `(n - k + 1) * k` operations.  Since `k` could potentially be close to `n/2`, this becomes about `n^2/4` operations, which means a time complexity of O(n^2), which is potentially too slow for larger values of n, and this will become significant because `n` can go up to `2 * 10^5`. I need to figure out a better solution.\n",
