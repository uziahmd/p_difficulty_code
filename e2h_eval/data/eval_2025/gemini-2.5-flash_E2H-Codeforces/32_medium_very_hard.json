    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on Array Stabilization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Array Stabilization\" problem. It's about taking an array of integers, and by removing *one* element, making the 'instability' – the difference between the maximum and minimum values – as small as possible. The inputs are within a decent range, up to 10^5 elements, which hints at an O(n log n) solution being fine.\n\nThe core of this seems to be about how the act of *removing* that single element affects the spread. I'm thinking, to minimize the instability, I need to make that resulting range (max - min) as tight as possible. Removing any element from the 'middle' might leave the overall range unchanged. Thus, I'll need to figure out what those 'min' and 'max' values will be *after* the removal.\n\nThe examples are helpful; let's sort the array, right? The key is that the sorted order reveals the potential new minimum and maximum values after an element is dropped. If I remove the smallest element, the new minimum will be the second smallest and new max will remain the same. Conversely, if I remove the largest element, the new maximum will be the second largest. The other removals have the original max and min. This is because any intermediate element won't change the actual range of values.\n\nSo, the algorithm becomes clear: sort the array, calculate the instability by removing the smallest element and also calculate by removing the largest and pick the minimum of those two.\n\nLet's test this with the provided examples again. Now, it matches the expectations. Edge cases like a two-element array also work, since they just become trivial calculations. The solution should be relatively efficient, requiring only a sort which is O(n log n) and constant-time calculations. Space complexity is O(N) at worst for sorting. This solution looks optimal.\n\nI'm ready to code this up! I'll read the input, sort the array, compute the two instabilities, and then print the minimum. The Python script looks good.\n",
