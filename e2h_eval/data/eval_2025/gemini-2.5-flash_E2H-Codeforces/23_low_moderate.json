            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Mahjong Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about this Tokitsukaze and Mahjong problem. My goal is to write a Python script that efficiently figures out the minimum number of extra tiles needed to complete a mentsu.  I'm dealing with three initial tiles, and a mentsu can either be a koutsu (three of a kind) or a shuntsu (a three-tile sequence in the same suit).\n\nFirst, I need to represent the tiles. A tuple of `(number, suit)` seems like the most straightforward way to go.  I'm considering a strategy of checking for a solution with zero draws, then one draw, and then two draws, since the problem asks for the *minimum*. It's unlikely that more than two draws would be necessary, given that with two extra tiles, I'd have five tiles, making it reasonably easy to form at least one mentsu.\n\nLet's break down the scenarios. With zero draws, I check if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu. For a koutsu, I just need to see if all three tiles are identical. For a shuntsu, I need to ensure all suits are the same, and the numbers are sequential after sorting.\n\nIf zero draws don't work, I move on to one draw.  Now, I'm thinking about having four tiles in total.  Since Tokitsukaze can draw any tile, I need to strategically determine if drawing *any* tile will allow me to form a mentsu.  This means checking all combinations of the initial three tiles with the drawn tile. I need to see if any subset of three tiles from the four total tiles form either a koutsu or a shuntsu. Essentially, I'm trying to find if I can \"complete\" a mentsu by adding one extra tile.  Remembering the rules: \"After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one\" is key here to avoid incorrectly checking the case of using the \"same tile twice\" as per my earlier draft.\n\nIt's getting clearer now. I can think about checking all three-tile subsets created by one new tile drawn.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles. She can draw any tiles, including duplicates.\n\nLet's represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`. For example, '1s' becomes `(1, 's')`.\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of draws, which can be 0, 1, or 2. It's guaranteed that 2 draws are always sufficient to form a mentsu if 0 or 1 draw isn't enough. We will check these cases in increasing order of draws.\n\n**0 Draws:**\nTokitsukaze already has a mentsu among her three initial tiles.\n1.  **Koutsu:** All three tiles are identical.\n    Example: `[1s, 1s, 1s]`\n2.  **Shuntsu:** All three tiles are of the same suit, and their numbers are sequential.\n    Example: `[1s, 2s, 3s]` (or `[2s, 1s, 3s]`, etc., order doesn't matter).\n    To check this, sort the numbers of same-suited tiles: `n, n+1, n+2`.\n\nIf either of these conditions is met, the answer is 0.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws are not enough, we check if one draw is sufficient. She will have 4 tiles. We need to find if there exists a drawn tile `t_draw` such that the set `initial_tiles + [t_draw]` contains a mentsu.\nThis is equivalent to checking if any two of her initial tiles `t_i, t_j` can form a mentsu with *some* `t_draw`.\n1.  **Pairs for Koutsu:** If she has two identical tiles, say `[1s, 1s]`, she can draw a third `1s` to form `[1s, 1s, 1s]`.\n2.  **Pairs for Shuntsu:** If she has two tiles of the same suit that are sequential, say `[1s, 2s]`, she can draw `3s` to form `[1s, 2s, 3s]`. If she has `[1s, 3s]`, she can draw `2s` to form `[1s, 2s, 3s]`.\nThe maximum difference in numbers for two tiles in a potential shuntsu is 2 (e.g., `1s` and `3s`).\n\nIf any of these conditions are met, the answer is 1.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf 0 or 1 draw is not enough, then 2 draws are guaranteed to be sufficient. The problem statement implies this by asking for the minimum. With 2 draws, she will have 5 tiles. It's always possible to form a mentsu with 5 tiles. For example, by drawing two tiles identical to one of her existing tiles, she can form a koutsu. If she has `1s`, she can draw two more `1s` to get `[1s, 1s, 1s]`.\n\nTherefore, if the answer is not 0 or 1, it must be 2.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n1.  Parse input tiles into a list of `(number, suit)` tuples.\n2.  Sort the tiles for easier comparison, especially for shuntsu. Sorting by suit then number is helpful.\n3.  Implement helper functions `check_koutsu(tiles)` and `check_shuntsu(tiles)` that return `True` if any 3 tiles in the given list form a mentsu.\n4.  The main logic will be:\n    *   If `check_mentsu(initial_tiles)` is `True`, print 0.\n    *   Else, iterate through all possible pairs of initial tiles `(t_i, t_j)`. For each pair, consider what `t_draw` would complete a koutsu or shuntsu. If such a `t_draw` exists, print 1 and exit.\n    *   Else, print 2.\n\nA simpler way to check for 1 draw:\nIterate through all 3 initial tiles `t1, t2, t3`.\n*   Check pairs for koutsu: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`. If any pair is identical (e.g., `t1 == t2`), she can draw `t1` (or `t2`) to form a koutsu.\n*   Check pairs for shuntsu: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`.\n    *   If `t_i.suit == t_j.suit`:\n        *   If `abs(t_i.num - t_j.num) == 0`: (e.g., `1s, 1s`) she can draw `1s` to make `1s, 1s, 1s`. (This is covered by koutsu check)\n        *   If `abs(t_i.num - t_j.num) == 1`: (e.g., `1s, 2s`) she can draw `3s` or `0s` (if `0s` existed) or `1s` (if `1s, 2s` could be completed by `1s` and `2s` to `1s, 1s, 2s` for example, this is not a shuntsu). More precisely, she can draw `t_i.num - 1` (if > 0) or `t_j.num + 1` (if < 10).\n        *   If `abs(t_i.num - t_j.num) == 2`: (e.g., `1s, 3s`) she can draw `2s`.\n\nLet's refactor the 1-draw check:\nFor each pair of tiles `(t_a, t_b)` from the initial three:\n1.  If `t_a == t_b`: One draw of `t_a` makes a koutsu.\n2.  If `t_a.suit == t_b.suit`:\n    *   If `abs(t_a.num - t_b.num) == 1`: (e.g., `1s, 2s`) Draw `t_a.num - 1` (if valid) or `t_b.num + 1` (if valid). Either creates a shuntsu.\n    *   If `abs(t_a.num - t_b.num) == 2`: (e.g., `1s, 3s`) Draw the middle tile `(t_a.num + t_b.num) / 2`. This creates a shuntsu.\n\nIf any of these conditions are met, the answer is 1.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    tiles_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for s in tiles_str:\n        num = int(s[0])\n        suit = s[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n\n    # Sort tiles for easier comparison (especially for shuntsu)\n    # Sort by suit first, then by number\n    tiles.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # Helper to check if a list of 3 tiles forms a mentsu\n    def is_mentsu(t1, t2, t3):\n        # Check for koutsu (triplet)\n        if t1 == t2 and t2 == t3:\n            return True\n        \n        # Check for shuntsu (sequence)\n        # All must be same suit\n        if t1[1] == t2[1] and t2[1] == t3[1]:\n            # Numbers must be sequential\n            nums = sorted([t1[0], t2[0], t3[0]])\n            if nums[0] + 1 == nums[1] and nums[1] + 1 == nums[2]:\n                return True\n        \n        return False\n\n    # --- Check 0 draws ---\n    if is_mentsu(tiles[0], tiles[1], tiles[2]):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # --- Check 1 draw ---\n    # We need to find if there's any pair of existing tiles\n    # that can form a mentsu with one extra drawn tile.\n    # This means we iterate through all possible pairs from the initial three tiles.\n    \n    # Possible pairs: (tiles[0], tiles[1]), (tiles[0], tiles[2]), (tiles[1], tiles[2])\n    \n    # Create a list of pairs to iterate through\n    pairs = [(tiles[0], tiles[1]), (tiles[0], tiles[2]), (tiles[1], tiles[2])]\n\n    for t_a, t_b in pairs:\n        # Condition 1: Can form a koutsu with one draw?\n        # If two tiles are identical, draw a third one.\n        if t_a == t_b:\n            print(1)\n            return\n\n        # Condition 2: Can form a shuntsu with one draw?\n        # Tiles must be of the same suit.\n        if t_a[1] == t_b[1]:\n            num_a, num_b = t_a[0], t_b[0]\n            \n            # If numbers are sequential (e.g., 1s, 2s)\n            # We can draw num_a-1 (if >0) or num_b+1 (if <10)\n            if abs(num_a - num_b) == 1:\n                # Example: (1s, 2s).
