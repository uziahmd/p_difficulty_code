He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Snowflake Vertex Count**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Rudolf and Snowflakes\" problem. The core of it is figuring out if a given number of vertices, `n`, can form a valid snowflake.  A snowflake, as defined, starts with a central vertex and then grows outwards in a very specific pattern, which I have to figure out mathematically.\n\nI've broken down the snowflake's construction into stages, trying to count vertices at each stage. It looks like:\n\n*   **Stage 0:** Just the central vertex, so 1 vertex.\n*   **Stage 1:** Connect the center to `k` new vertices, where `k` is greater than 1. So, we have `1 + k` vertices. These `k` vertices are only connected to the center.\n*   **Stage 2 and beyond:** This is the key.  We introduce a parameter `d`, which represents how many times we repeat a certain growth step. In this repeated step, each vertex added in the previous stage that is connected to only one other vertex gets linked to `k` *more* vertices. The problem states that `d` must be at least 1.  So, in the first such step, we connect each of the initial `k` vertices to `k` more, so we get `k * k` or `k^2` more. This brings the total to `1 + k + k^2`. Then, each of those `k^2` new vertices gets linked to `k` more, and so on.\n\nThe general formula I'm getting is that the total number of vertices, `n`, can be expressed as a geometric series: `n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(d+1)`.  The requirement of `d >= 1` is critical.\n\nSo, I have the sum of a geometric series here. This means `n = (k^(d+2) - 1) / (k - 1)`. I'm given `n` (up to a whopping 10^18), and I'm looking for valid integer values of `k > 1` and `d >= 1` that satisfy this equation.\n\nI can make a little substitution, saying `D = d+1`, so `D >= 2`. The equation now becomes `n = (k^(D+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`. I'll need to figure out an efficient way to search for these `k` and `D` values within the given constraints to see if a solution exists. This looks like the main challenge, and it's where I need to focus my efforts in crafting an efficient Python script.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake. A snowflake is defined by a construction process that results in a total number of vertices `n` satisfying the equation:\n`n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^D`\nwhere `k > 1` is an integer and `D >= 2` is an integer (representing `d+1` where `d` is the number of times the third step is performed, and `d >= 1`).\n\nThis is a sum of a geometric series, which can be written as `n = (k^(D+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n\nWe need to check if for a given `n` (up to `10^18`), there exist integers `k > 1` and `D >= 2` that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for `D`:\n\n**Case 1: `D = 2`**\nThe equation becomes `n = 1 + k + k^2`.\nThis is a quadratic equation in `k`: `k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0`.\nUsing the quadratic formula, `k = (-1 ± sqrt(1 - 4 * 1 * (1 - n))) / (2 * 1) = (-1 ± sqrt(1 - 4 + 4n)) / 2 = (-1 ± sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2`.\nFor `k` to be an integer greater than 1, `4n - 3` must be a perfect square, say `s^2`.\nSo, `s = sqrt(4n - 3)`. Then `k = (-1 + s) / 2`.\nWe need to check if `s` is an integer, `s > 0`, and `(-1 + s) / 2` is an integer greater than 1.\nIf `s` is an integer, then `s` must be odd for `(-1 + s)` to be even. If `s` is odd, `s^2 = 4n - 3` will be odd, which is consistent.\nAlso, `k > 1` implies `(-1 + s) / 2 > 1`, which means `-1 + s > 2`, so `s > 3`.\nSo, for `D=2`, we check if `4n - 3` is a perfect square `s^2` where `s > 3`. If it is, then `k = (s - 1) / 2` is a valid `k`.\n\n**Case 2: `D >= 3`**\nWhen `D` is large, `k` must be small.\nIf `k` is fixed, `n` grows very rapidly with `D`.\nIf `D` is fixed, `n` grows very rapidly with `k`.\n\nLet's consider the bounds for `k` and `D`:\nSince `k > 1` and `D >= 2`:\n`n = 1 + k + ... + k^D`\n`n > k^D`\nSo, `k < n^(1/D)`.\nAlso, `n = 1 + k + ... + k^D < k^D + k^D + ... + k^D = D * k^D` (this is a loose upper bound, `n < (k^(D+1))/(k-1)` is better).\nA tighter lower bound for `n` is `k^D`.\nSo, `k < n^(1/D)`.\n\nIf `D >= 60`, then `k < n^(1/60) <= (10^18)^(1/60) = 10^(18/60) = 10^(0.3) < 2`.\nSince `k > 1`, there are no possible integer `k` values for `D >= 60`.\nSo, `D` can range from `3` to `59`.\n\nFor each `D` in `[3, 59]`:\nWe need to find if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that `1 + k + ... + k^D = n`.\nThis is equivalent to finding a root for the polynomial `P(x) = 1 + x + ... + x^D - n = 0`.\nSince `P(x)` is strictly increasing for `x > 0`, there can be at most one positive root.\nWe can use binary search to find `k`.\nThe range for `k` is `[2, floor(n^(1/D))]`.\nA safe upper bound for `k` can be `2 * 10^9` (since `2^60 > 10^18`).\nThe binary search range for `k` would be `[2, min(2 * 10^9, floor(n^(1/D)) + 2)]`. Or simply `[2, 2 * 10^9]` as `n^(1/D)` will be less than this for `D >= 3`.\n\nInside the binary search:\nFor a `mid` value, calculate `S = 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^D`.\nBe careful with overflow when calculating `mid^j`. If `mid^j` exceeds `n`, then `S` will also exceed `n`.\nIf `S == n`, we found a valid `k` and `D`.\nIf `S < n`, we need a larger `k`, so `low = mid + 1`.\nIf `S > n`, we need a smaller `k`, so `high = mid - 1`.\n\nThe maximum value of `D` is `59`. The maximum value of `k` is roughly `2 * 10^9` (for `D=3`, `k^3 approx n`, so `k approx (10^18)^(1/3) = 10^6`).\nThe binary search for `k` takes `log(2 * 10^9)` iterations, which is about `31` iterations.\nInside each iteration, we calculate `1 + k + ... + k^D`. This sum takes `D` multiplications and `D` additions. Max `D` is `59`.\nSo for `D >= 3`, the total complexity is `D_max * log(K_max) * D_max` which is `59 * 31 * 59` roughly, which is efficient enough.\n\n**Optimization for sum calculation:**\nWhen calculating `S = 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^D` inside the binary search, we can stop early if `mid^j` (or the partial sum) exceeds `n`.\n```python\ncurrent_sum = 1\ncurrent_power = 1\nfor _ in range(D): # D terms after 1, so up to k^D\n    if current_power > n // mid: # Check for overflow before multiplying\n        current_sum = n + 1 # Indicate sum exceeds n\n        break\n    current_power *= mid\n    if current_sum > n - current_power: # Check for overflow before adding\n        current_sum = n + 1 # Indicate sum exceeds n\n        break\n    current_sum += current_power\n```\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n`n = 1, 2, 3`: No snowflakes possible.\n`n = 1`: `1 = (k^(D+1)-1)/(k-1)`. Smallest `k=2, D=2` gives `1+2+4=7`. So `n=1` is NO.\n`n = 2`: `2 = (k^(D+1)-1)/(k-1)`. Smallest `k=2, D=2` gives `7`. So `n=2` is NO.\n`n = 3`: `3 = (k^(D+1)-1)/(k-1)`. Smallest `k=2, D=2` gives `7`. So `n=3` is NO.\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1. Handle `n=1, 2, 3` as special cases (always \"NO\").\n2. Check `D=2`: Calculate `s_squared = 4n - 3`. Check if `s_squared` is a perfect square `s^2`. If `s` is an integer and `s > 3`, then `k = (s - 1) / 2` is a valid `k`. If so, print \"YES\".\n3. Check `D` from `3` to `59`:\n   For each `D`, perform a binary search for `k` in the range `[2, 2 * 10^9]`.\n   Inside the binary search, calculate `current_sum = 1 + k + ... + k^D` with overflow checks.\n   If `current_sum == n` for any `k` and `D`, print \"YES\" and terminate.\n4. If no `k` and `D` are found after all checks, print \"NO\".\n\nThe maximum number of test cases `t` is `10^4`.\nEach test case:\n- `D=2` check: `sqrt` operation, constant time.\n- Loop `D=3` to `59`: `57` iterations.\n  - Binary search: `~31` iterations.\n  - Sum calculation: `~59` operations.\nTotal operations per test case: `1 + 57 * 31 * 59` which is roughly `1 + 10^5` operations.\nTotal operations for `10^4` test cases: `10^4 * 10^5 = 10^9`. This might be too slow.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the binary search upper bound.\nFor `D=3`, `k^3 < n <= 10^18`, so `k < (10^18)^(1/3) = 10^6`.\nFor `D=4`, `k^4 < n <= 10^18`, so `k < (10^18)^(1/4) approx 177827`.\nFor `D=59`, `k^59 < n <= 10^18`, so `k < (10^18)^(1/59) approx 2.05`. So `k` can only be `2`.\n\nThe binary search range for `k` can be `[2, int(n**(1/D)) + 2]` (add 2 for safety).\nFor `D=3`, `k` up to `10^6`. `log(10^6)` is about `20`.\nSo, `57 * 20 * 59` is roughly `67000`. This is good.\nThe overall complexity `10^4 * 67000` is `6.7 * 10^8`. This might still be too slow.\n\nLet's check the maximum value for `k` more precisely.\n`n = 1 + k + ... + k^D`.\nSmallest `n` is `7` (`k=2, D=2`).\nSmallest `n` for `D=3` is `1+2+4+8=15` (`k=2`).\nSmallest `n` for `D=59` is `1+2+...+2^59 = 2^60 - 1`. This is `~1.15 * 10^18`.\nSo `k=2` is the only possibility for large `D`.\n\nThe `n**(1/D)` calculation is floating point, so it might have precision issues.\nWe can set a fixed upper bound for `k` for binary search, e.g., `10^6 + 100` (since `k` for `D=3` is at most `10^6`). For larger `D`, `n^(1/D)` will be smaller than `10^6`.\nSo, the binary search range for `k` can be `[2, 10^6 + 100]`.\n`log(10^6)` is `~20`.\nSo `57 * 20 * 59` is indeed `~67000`.\n\nThe total complexity `10^4 * 6.7 * 10^4 = 6.7 * 10^8` operations is on the edge for a 2-second time limit. Python is slower than C++, so this might TLE.\n\nLet's consider the maximum value of `k` for `n=10^18`.\nFor `D=3`, `k^3 < 10^18`, so `k < 10^6`.\nFor `D=4`, `k^4 < 10^18`, so `k < 10^{4.5} approx 31622`.\nFor `D=5`, `k^5 < 10^18`, so `k < 10^{3.6} approx 3981`.\nFor `D=6`, `k^6 < 10^18`, so `k < 10^3 = 1000`.\nFor `D=7`, `k^7 < 10^18`, so `k < 10^{18/7} approx 10^{2.57} approx 371`.\nFor `D=8`, `k^8 < 10^18`, so `k < 10^{18/8} = 10^{2.25} approx 177`.\nFor `D=9`, `k^9 < 10^18`, so `k < 10^2 = 100`.\nFor `D=10`, `k^{10} < 10^18`, so `k < 10^{1.8} approx 63`.\nFor `D=18`, `k^{18} < 10^18`, so `k < 10`.\nFor `D=36`, `k^{36} < 10^18`, so `k < 10^{0.5} approx 3`. So `k` can only be `2`.\nFor `D=59`, `k^{59} < 10^18`, so `k < 10^{18/59} approx 2.05`. So `k` can only be `2`.\n\nThis means for `D > 36`, we only need to check `k=2`.\nIf `D > 36`, we can just calculate `S = (2^(D+1) - 1)` and check if `S == n`.\nThe maximum `D` for `k=2` is `59`. So `2^60 - 1`. `2^60` is `1.15 * 10^18`. This is within `10^18`.\nSo, for `D` from `37` to `59`, we just check `k=2`. This is `23` constant time checks.\n\nRevised algorithm:\n1. Handle `n=1, 2, 3` as \"NO\".\n2. Check `D=2`: `s_squared = 4n - 3`. If `s_squared` is a perfect square `s^2` and `s > 3`, print \"YES\".\n3. Check `D` from `3` to `36`:\n   For each `D`, binary search for `k` in `[2, 10^6 + 100]`. If `n^(1/D)` is very small, we can limit `high` to `int(n**(1/D)) + 2`.\n   The upper bound `10^6 + 100` is only relevant for `D=3`. For `D=36`, `n^(1/36)` is `~2.9`, so `k` can only be `2`.\n   The actual upper bound for `k` should be `min(10**6 + 100, int(n**(1/D)) + 2)`.\n   If `current_sum == n`, print \"YES\".\n4. Check `D` from `37` to `59`:\n   For each `D`, check if `(2**(D+1) - 1) == n`. If it is, print \"YES\".\n5. If no solution found, print \"NO\".\n\nLet's refine the binary search range for `k`.\n`k_max_for_D = int(n**(1/D)) + 2`.\nSo for `D=3`, `k_max_for_D` is `10^6 + 2`. `log_2(10^6) approx 20`.\nFor `D=36`, `k_max_for_D` is `2 + 2 = 4`. `log_2(4) = 2`.\nThe `log_2(k_max)` factor is smaller for larger `D`.\nAverage `log_2(k_max)` is roughly `(20 + 2) / 2 = 11`.\nSo `34 * 11 * 59` is roughly `22000`. This is much better.\nTotal `10^4 * 2.2 * 10^4 = 2.2 * 10^8`. This should pass.\n\nExample trace for `n=13`:\n1. `n=13`. Not `1,2,3`.\n2. `D=2`: `4n-3 = 4*13 - 3 = 52 - 3 = 49`. `sqrt(49) = 7`. `s=7`. `s > 3` is true. `k = (7-1)/2 = 3`. `k=3` is valid. Print \"YES\".\n\nExample trace for `n=15`:\n1. `n=15`. Not `1,2,3`.\n2. `D=2`: `4n-3 = 4*15 - 3 = 60 - 3 = 57`. `sqrt(57)` is not an integer.\n3. `D=3`: Binary search for `k`. Range `[2, int(15**(1/3))+2] = [2, int(2.46)+2] = [2, 4]`.\n   - `low=2, high=4`. `mid=3`. `1+3+3^2+3^3 = 1+3+9+27 = 40`. `40 > 15`. `high = 2`.\n   - `low=2, high=2`. `mid=2`. `1+2+2^2+2^3 = 1+2+4+8 = 15`. `15 == n`. Print \"YES\".\n\nFinal check on constraints and types:\n`n` up to `10^18`, so use Python's arbitrary precision integers.\n`k` can be up to `10^6`. `D` up to `59`.\n`k^D` can be up to `(10^6)^3 = 10^18`. `k^D` can be `2^59` which is also `~5 * 10^17`.\nThe sum `1 + k + ... + k^D` can be `n`, up to `10^18`.\nIntermediate `current_power` or `current_sum` could exceed `n` by a small amount before being capped, but it will fit in standard `int` types in Python.\nThe overflow check `current_power > n // mid` prevents `current_power * mid` from exceeding `n` if `mid` is large. If `n // mid` is small, `current_power` will be capped.\nThe check `current_sum > n - current_power` prevents `current_sum + current_power` from exceeding `n` if `current_power` is large.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n <= 3:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Case D = 2: n = 1 + k + k^2\n    # k^2 + k + (1 - n) = 0\n    # k = (-1 + sqrt(1 - 4(1-n))) / 2 = (-1 + sqrt(4n - 3)) / 2\n    discriminant = 4 * n - 3\n    s_sqrt = int(math.isqrt(discriminant)) # integer square root\n\n    if s_sqrt * s_sqrt == discriminant:\n        # Check if s_sqrt is odd, so -1 + s_sqrt is even\n        # and k > 1\n        if (s_sqrt - 1) % 2 == 0:\n            k = (s_sqrt - 1) // 2\n            if k > 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                return\n\n    # Case D >= 3: n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^D\n    # D ranges from 3 to 59 (since 2^60 - 1 is approx 1.15 * 10^18, k=2, D=59 is max for n <= 10^18)\n    # k ranges from 2 up to approx 10^6 (for D=3)\n    \n    # Max k for D=3 is roughly (10^18)^(1/3) = 10^6\n    # Max k for D=59 is roughly (10^18)^(1/59) approx 2.05\n    # The upper bound for binary search can be dynamic\n    \n    for D in range(3, 60): # D up to 59\n        low = 2\n        # Calculate a tight upper bound for k.\n        # k^D < n, so k < n^(1/D)\n        # Use min(10^6 + 2, int(n**(1/D)) + 2) to limit the search space for k.\n        # For small D, n**(1/D) can be large.
