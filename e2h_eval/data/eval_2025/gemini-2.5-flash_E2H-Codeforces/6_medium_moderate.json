Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Efficiently Solving the Disjoint Voucher Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem where the goal is to find two non-overlapping \"vouchers\" whose durations add up to a target value, `x`, while minimizing their combined cost. The input gives me a list of vouchers, each defined by a start day, end day, and cost. If no such pair exists, I need to print -1.\n\nMy initial thought was to brute-force this, checking every possible pair of vouchers. But with up to 200,000 vouchers, that would be way too slow (O(N^2)). I'm looking for an O(N log N) or, ideally, an O(N) solution.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the constraints: two distinct vouchers that don't overlap (one must end before the other begins), their durations add up to exactly `x`, and I need to minimize the total cost. I'm calling the duration of voucher `k` as `d_k = r_k - l_k + 1`. So, I need to find `d_i + d_j = x` and I also need `r_i < l_j` or `r_j < l_i`.  Minimizing `cost_i + cost_j`.\n\nI started by analyzing the duration and non-intersection conditions. The maximum start and end days are `2 * 10^5`. I can call this `MAX_COORD`.\n\nSorting the vouchers by start or end day seemed like a good idea.  If I iterate through vouchers sorted by start day, for each voucher 'i', I'd need to efficiently find a subsequent voucher 'j' whose duration is `x - d_i`, that's the key.  And `r_i` must be less than `l_j`.\n\nThen I thought about processing events: voucher starts and ends. So, when I consider a voucher 'k' that's starting, I want to find a voucher 'j' that has already ended with the appropriate duration to make the sum `x`. This suggests a sweep-line algorithm.\n\nMy strategy now is to use a sweep-line approach. I'll iterate through each day, keeping track of vouchers that have ended by that day.  For each day:\n\n1.  I'll process vouchers that end on the previous day. I will keep in memory the minimum cost voucher for all possible durations. This is the minimum cost for the voucher.\n\n2.  For vouchers starting on the current day, I'll calculate the required duration for a second voucher to sum to `x` and query the data structure for that duration. This data structure efficiently holds the minimum costs for vouchers with specific durations that have *ended* before the current day, so I can check if that paired voucher exists and is the cheapest.\n\nI maintain an array `min_cost_for_duration[duration]`, initialized to infinity. It will store the minimum cost of a voucher with the corresponding duration that has ended *strictly before* the current sweep-line position.\n\nI create two lists: `vouchers_starting_at[l]` stores vouchers starting at day `l`, and `vouchers_ending_at[r]` stores vouchers ending at day `r`.\n\nI iterate through the days from 1 to `MAX_COORD`.\n\nAt each day, first update `min_cost_for_duration` from the vouchers that *ended* on the *previous* day.  Then, look at vouchers that *started* on the current day to try to pair them with an earlier voucher.\n\nIf I find a pair of vouchers that satisfy the condition, I update the minimum cost seen so far. Finally, if the minimum cost hasn't changed from infinity, the answer is -1.\n\nThe crucial part is the `day` loop. To find a voucher j starting on the current day `cur_day`, the voucher i should have ended on the `cur_day - 1`. The `min_cost_for_duration` for `d_j` at the prior day, needs to be updated.\n\nWith this approach, I can solve this within the time limit.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct vouchers `i` and `j` such that they do not intersect, the sum of their durations is exactly `x`, and their total cost `cost_i + cost_j` is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should print -1.\n\nLet `(l_k, r_k, cost_k)` be the start day, end day, and cost of voucher `k`. The duration of voucher `k` is `d_k = r_k - l_k + 1`.\n\nThe conditions are:\n1.  `i ≠ j` (distinct vouchers).\n2.  `d_i + d_j = x`.\n3.  Vouchers `i` and `j` do not intersect. This means either `r_i < l_j` or `r_j < l_i`. Without loss of generality, let's assume `r_i < l_j`. We can find the minimum cost for this case, and the symmetry will cover the `r_j < l_i` case.\n4.  Minimize `cost_i + cost_j`.\n\nThe maximum values for `n`, `x`, `l_i`, `r_i` are `2 * 10^5`. This suggests a solution with complexity around O(N + MAX_COORD) or O(N log N), where `MAX_COORD` is the maximum possible `l_i` or `r_i`.\n\nWe can solve this using a sweep-line algorithm. We'll iterate through the days from `1` up to `MAX_COORD` (the maximum possible end day).\n\nHere's the approach:\n1.  **Data Structures for Vouchers:**\n    *   `vouchers_starting_at[day]`: A list of `(r, cost, duration)` tuples for all vouchers that start on `day`.\n    *   `vouchers_ending_at[day]`: A list of `(cost, duration)` tuples for all vouchers that end on `day`.\n    We'll pre-process the input vouchers into these lists. The maximum coordinate is `2 * 10^5`, so these lists will be arrays of size `MAX_COORD + 1`.\n\n2.  **Tracking Minimum Costs for Available Vouchers:**\n    *   `min_cost_for_duration[d]`: An array initialized to `float('inf')`. At any point in the sweep-line, `min_cost_for_duration[d]` will store the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has *already ended strictly before the current day*. This is crucial for satisfying the non-intersection condition `r_i < l_j`.\n\n3.  **Sweep-Line Logic:**\n    *   Initialize `min_total_cost = float('inf')`. This will store our final answer.\n    *   Iterate `current_day` from `1` to `MAX_COORD`.\n        *   **Step 1: Update `min_cost_for_duration` with vouchers that ended on `current_day - 1`.**\n            If `current_day > 1`, this means any voucher that ended on `current_day - 1` (or earlier) is now available to be paired with a voucher starting on `current_day` (or later).\n            For each `(cost_val, duration_val)` in `vouchers_ending_at[current_day - 1]`:\n                `min_cost_for_duration[duration_val] = min(min_cost_for_duration[duration_val], cost_val)`.\n        *   **Step 2: Process vouchers starting on `current_day`.**\n            For each voucher `v_k = (r_k, cost_k, d_k)` in `vouchers_starting_at[current_day]`:\n                We need to find a voucher `v_j` such that `d_j = x - d_k` and `r_j < current_day`.\n                Let `required_duration_j = x - d_k`.\n                If `required_duration_j` is a valid duration (i.e., `1 <= required_duration_j <= MAX_COORD`):\n                    If `min_cost_for_duration[required_duration_j]` is not `float('inf')` (meaning such a `v_j` exists):\n                        `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_k + min_cost_for_duration[required_duration_j])`.\n\n4.  **Result:**\n    After the loop finishes, if `min_total_cost` is still `float('inf')`, it means no such pair of vouchers was found, so print -1. Otherwise, print `min_total_cost`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Sample):**\n`n=4, x=5`\nVouchers: `(1,3,4)`, `(1,2,5)`, `(5,6,1)`, `(1,2,4)`\nDurations: `3`, `2`, `2`, `2`\n\n`MAX_COORD = 6` (since max `r` is 6).\n`vouchers_starting_at`: `1: [(3,4,3), (2,5,2), (2,4,2)]`, `5: [(6,1,2)]`\n`vouchers_ending_at`: `2: [(5,2), (4,2)]`, `3: [(4,3)]`, `6: [(1,2)]`\n`min_cost_for_duration = [inf] * 7`\n`min_total_cost = inf`\n\n*   **`current_day = 1`**:\n    *   `vouchers_ending_at[0]` (empty).\n    *   `vouchers_starting_at[1]`:\n        *   `(r=3,c=4,d=3)`: `required_d_j = 5-3=2`. `min_cost_for_duration[2]` is `inf`.
