After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this \"Marks\" problem. This seems straightforward enough for a Python script. My immediate thought is, \"keep it simple, stupid,\" and go with basic data structures and efficient, iterative logic.**\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. I'll read `n` and `m`, then store the gradebook as a list of strings, each string representing a student's marks.  I'll initialize `max_marks_per_subject` as a list of '0' characters, since all marks are 1-9. This sets up the foundation.\n\nNext, I'll go through each subject to find the maximum mark. It's a nested loop – outer loop is subjects, inner is students. In the inner loop, I compare each student's mark to the current maximum for that subject, updating if needed. Direct character comparison works here because '9' is the highest, and characters are sorted based on their ASCII values.\n\nNow for the core logic: identifying successful students. I'll initialize a `successful_students_count` variable to 0.  I'll iterate through each student and then each subject for that student. If a student's mark matches the maximum mark for that subject, I increment `successful_students_count` and immediately break out of the inner subject loop. There's no need to check other subjects for a student once they've been confirmed as successful in at least one.\n\nFinally, I just print the `successful_students_count`.\n\nThe algorithm is O(n*m) for everything – reading the input, finding max marks, and finding successful students.  With the constraints of n and m being <= 100, this is incredibly fast. There are no fancy data structures or complex recursion here. Character comparisons will work efficiently since we're only dealing with single digits. The key is in the nested loops and the `break` statement to avoid unnecessary calculations. Seems like a very efficient and elegant solution for this particular problem.\n",
