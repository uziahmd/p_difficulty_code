The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$.

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this \"Abnormal Permutation Pairs (hard version)\" problem:**\n\nMy goal is to craft a Python solution, keeping in mind the need for efficiency due to the `n <= 500` constraint. We're looking for pairs of permutations `(p, q)` where `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q`, and the number of inversions in `p` is *greater* than the number in `q`.  We have to output the result modulo some large prime.\n\nThe sheer size of the search space, `(n!)^2`, tells me a brute-force approach is completely out of the question.  Dynamic Programming (DP) is the clear path. I know there's a standard DP approach for counting permutations by inversions.\n\nMy initial thought is to tackle this by generating the DP table for the count of permutations with a given number of inversions, which will take `O(n * MAX_INV)` time, where `MAX_INV` is the maximum possible number of inversions for a permutation of size `n` which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`. The values for `n` = 500 would produce huge numbers, and I also need to use the modulo.\n\nThe challenge is the \"lexicographically smaller\" condition, along with `inv(p) > inv(q)`. This complicates things. Simply counting permutations with a certain number of inversions isn't enough. We need to somehow incorporate the lexicographic comparison. I'm going to have to carefully consider a DP that tracks this.\n\nMy intuition says to build up `p` and `q` position by position. We can build it as `dp[i][inv_diff][status]`, where `i` is length of permutation prefix, `inv_diff` is the difference between inversions in the two permutation prefixes, and `status` indicates whether the prefix of p is smaller than, equal to, or greater than that of q. This is a promising approach, but the huge state space (which will require some trickery to avoid being too slow) means I need to carefully choose how to represent `inv_diff`.\n\nThe first thing I am going to do is figure out the DP for inversions, and see if I can use it.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count pairs of permutations `(p, q)` of `1, ..., n` such that `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q` AND `inv(p) > inv(q)`, modulo `mod`. The constraints are `n <= 500`.\n\nLet `MAX_INV = n * (n - 1) / 2` be the maximum possible number of inversions for a permutation of `n` elements. For `n=500`, `MAX_INV = 124750`.\n\nWe can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We need to keep track of the lexicographical status and the difference in inversion counts.\n\nLet `dp[k][diff_val]` be the number of pairs of permutations `(p', q')` of `1, ..., k` such that `inv(p') - inv(q') = diff_val`.\nThe `diff_val` can range from `-k*(k-1)/2` to `k*(k-1)/2`. To handle negative indices, we can shift `diff_val` by `MAX_INV`. So, `dp[k][diff_val + MAX_INV]` will store the count.\nThe base case is `dp[0][0 + MAX_INV] = 1` (empty permutations have 0 inversions, difference 0).\n\nTo compute `dp[k]` from `dp[k-1]`:\nWe consider inserting the number `k` into all pairs of permutations `(p', q')` of `1, ..., k-1`.\nSuppose `p'` has `inv_p_prev` inversions and `q'` has `inv_q_prev` inversions.\nWhen `k` is inserted into `p'`, it can be placed in `k` positions. If placed at `j`-th position (0-indexed), it creates `k-1-j` new inversions. So `x = k-1-j` new inversions, where `x` can be `0, ..., k-1`.\nSimilarly, for `q'`, inserting `k` can add `y` new inversions, where `y` can be `0, ..., k-1`.\nThe new difference in inversions will be `(inv_p_prev + x) - (inv_q_prev + y) = (inv_p_prev - inv_q_prev) + (x - y)`.\nLet `diff_prev = inv_p_prev - inv_q_prev`.\nLet `diff_new = diff_prev + (x - y)`.\nSo, `dp[k][diff_new + MAX_INV]` is updated by summing `dp[k-1][diff_prev + MAX_INV]` over all `diff_prev`, and for each `diff_prev`, multiplying by the number of ways to get `x-y = diff_new - diff_prev`.\nThe number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `0 <= x, y < k` and `x - y = d` is `k - |d|`. (This can be derived by iterating `x` from `max(0, d)` to `min(k-1, k-1+d)` and setting `y=x-d`).\n\nThus, the recurrence is:\n`dp[k][diff_new + MAX_INV] = sum_{d=-(k-1)}^{k-1} dp[k-1][(diff_new - d) + MAX_INV] * (k - |d|)`.\nThis is a convolution. The size of `dp[k]` is `k*(k-1)+1`. The number of terms in `(k-|d|)` is `2k-1`.\nThe complexity for computing `dp[k]` from `dp[k-1]` is `O(k^2 * k) = O(k^3)`.\nTotal complexity for this DP table is `sum_{k=1}^n O(k^3) = O(n^4)`.\nFor `n=500`, `500^4 = 6.25 * 10^{10}`, which is too slow.\n\nThe `dp[k][diff_val]` can be computed more efficiently.\nLet `P_k(z) = sum_{diff} dp[k][diff + MAX_INV] z^{diff}`.\nThen `P_k(z) = P_{k-1}(z) * (sum_{x=0}^{k-1} z^x) * (sum_{y=0}^{k-1} z^{-y})`.\nLet `S_k(z) = sum_{j=0}^{k-1} z^j`.\n`P_k(z) = P_{k-1}(z) * S_k(z) * S_k(z^{-1})`.\nThe coefficients of `S_k(z) * S_k(z^{-1})` are `c_d = k - |d|` for `-(k-1) <= d <= k-1`.\n`S_k(z) * S_k(z^{-1}) = (1+z+...+z^{k-1}) (1+z^{-1}+...+z^{-(k-1)})`.\nLet `Q_k(z) = S_k(z) * S_k(z^{-1})`.\n`Q_k(z) = Q_{k-1}(z) * (1 + z^{k-1} + z^{-(k-1)}) - Q_{k-1}(z) * z^{k-1} * z^{-(k-1)}`. This is not easy.\nInstead, observe `S_k(z) = S_{k-1}(z) + z^{k-1}`.\n`S_k(z^{-1}) = S_{k-1}(z^{-1}) + z^{-(k-1)}`.\n`P_k(z) = P_{k-1}(z) * (S_{k-1}(z) + z^{k-1}) * (S_{k-1}(z^{-1}) + z^{-(k-1)})`.\nThis is still a convolution.\nHowever, there is a trick for the `dp[k][diff_val]` recurrence:\n`dp[k][j + MAX_INV] = sum_{x=0}^{k-1} sum_{y=0}^{k-1} dp[k-1][(j - (x-y)) + MAX_INV]`.\nThis is `dp[k][j + MAX_INV] = sum_{d=-(k-1)}^{k-1} (k-|d|) * dp[k-1][(j-d) + MAX_INV]`.\nThis is `dp[k][j + MAX_INV] = (dp[k][j-1 + MAX_INV] + dp[k-1][j + MAX_INV] - dp[k-1][j-k + MAX_INV])` for `j >= 0`.\nThis is the same recurrence as for `dp_inversions[k][num_inversions]`.\n`dp[k][j + MAX_INV] = dp[k][j-1 + MAX_INV] + dp[k-1][j+k + MAX_INV] - dp[k-1][j-k + MAX_INV]` (this is wrong).\n\nLet `f[i][j]` be the number of permutations of `1...i` with `j` inversions.\n`f[i][j] = (f[i][j-1] + f[i-1][j] - f[i-1][j-i]) % mod`. (Assuming `f[i][<0]=0`).\nLet `g[i][j]` be the number of pairs of permutations `(p, q)` of `1...i` such that `inv(p) - inv(q) = j`.\n`g[i][j]` is computed from `g[i-1][...]` by considering inserting `i`.\n`g[i][j]` is `sum_{x=0}^{i-1} sum_{y=0}^{i-1} g[i-1][j - (x-y)]`.\nThe values `x` and `y` represent the number of inversions added by inserting `i` into `p` and `q` respectively.\nThis means `g[i][j]` is the coefficient of `z^j` in `P_{i-1}(z) * (sum_{x=0}^{i-1} z^x) * (sum_{y=0}^{i-1} z^{-y})`.\nLet `T_i(z) = (sum_{x=0}^{i-1} z^x) * (sum_{y=0}^{i-1} z^{-y})`.\nThe coefficients of `T_i(z)` are `k-|d|` for `d` from `-(i-1)` to `(i-1)`.\n`P_i(z) = P_{i-1}(z) * T_i(z)`.\n`T_i(z) = T_{i-1}(z) * (1 + z^{i-1} + z^{-(i-1)}) - T_{i-1}(z) * z^{i-1} * z^{-(i-1)}`. This is not correct.\n`T_i(z) = (S_{i-1}(z) + z^{i-1}) * (S_{i-1}(z^{-1}) + z^{-(i-1)})`.\n`T_i(z) = T_{i-1}(z) + S_{i-1}(z)z^{-(i-1)} + S_{i-1}(z^{-1})z^{i-1} + 1`.\nThe coefficients of `S_{i-1}(z)z^{-(i-1)}` are `1` for `d` from `-(i-1)` to `-1`.\nThe coefficients of `S_{i-1}(z^{-1})z^{i-1}` are `1` for `d` from `1` to `i-1`.\nSo `g[i][j]` can be computed from `g[i-1][j]` by adding `g[i-1][j]` (for `d=0`), `g[i-1][j-d]` for `d` from `1` to `i-1` and `g[i-1][j-d]` for `d` from `-(i-1)` to `-1`.\nThis means `g[i][j] = sum_{d=-(i-1)}^{i-1} (k-|d|) g[i-1][j-d]`. This is the `O(n^4)` approach.\n\nThe correct `O(N^3)` DP for `g[i][j]` (number of pairs of permutations of `1..i` with inv diff `j`):\n`g[i][j]` is the coefficient of `z^j` in `P_i(z) = P_{i-1}(z) * (sum_{k=0}^{i-1} z^k) * (sum_{k=0}^{i-1} z^{-k})`.\nLet `h_i(z) = sum_{k=0}^{i-1} z^k`.\n`P_i(z) = P_{i-1}(z) * h_i(z) * h_i(z^{-1})`.\n`h_i(z) = h_{i-1}(z) + z^{i-1}`.\n`h_i(z^{-1}) = h_{i-1}(z^{-1}) + z^{-(i-1)}`.\n`P_i(z) = P_{i-1}(z) * (h_{i-1}(z) + z^{i-1}) * (h_{i-1}(z^{-1}) + z^{-(i-1)})`\n`= P_{i-1}(z) * (h_{i-1}(z)h_{i-1}(z^{-1}) + h_{i-1}(z)z^{-(i-1)} + h_{i-1}(z^{-1})z^{i-1} + 1)`.\n`P_i(z) = P_{i-1}(z) * h_{i-1}(z)h_{i-1}(z^{-1}) + P_{i-1}(z) * (h_{i-1}(z)z^{-(i-1)} + h_{i-1}(z^{-1})z^{i-1} + 1)`.\nThe first term is `P_{i-1}(z) * h_{i-1}(z)h_{i-1}(z^{-1}) = P_{i-1}(z) * T_{i-1}(z) = P_{i-1}(z)`.

It does not work for arbitrary subsets of values.\n\nThe `O(N^3)` DP `dp[k][diff][state]` must be the correct way.\nThe values `p_k` and `q_k` are implicitly `k`.\nThe `dp[k][diff][state]` is for permutations of `1..k`.\nThis implies `p_k` and `q_k` are `k`.\nIf `p_k` and `q_k` are `k`, then `p_k=q_k`. So `lex_state` cannot change.\nThis is why `dp[k][diff][0]` and `dp[k][diff][2]` are just convolutions of `dp[k-1][diff][0]` and `dp[k-1][diff][2]`.\nAnd `dp[k][diff][1]` is a convolution of `dp[k-1][diff][1]`.\nThis means `dp[k][diff][0]` is `0` for all `k`. `dp[k][diff][2]` is `0` for all `k`.\nAnd `dp[k][diff][1]` is `g[k][diff]`.\nThis is consistent with `1512`.\n\nThe problem is that `p` and `q` are permutations of `1..n`.\nThe DP `dp[k][diff][state]` must represent permutations of `1..n`, not `1..k`.\nThe only way `O(N^3)` works is if the values don't matter.\nThis is the case for inversions. The number of inversions only depends on relative order.\nBut for lexicographical comparison, the values matter.\n\nThe problem is hard. It's not \"very easy\" as the note says.\nThe solution must be the `O(N^3)` DP.\nThe sample output `17` is very small.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, mod = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    MAX_INV_N = n * (n - 1) // 2\n\n    # dp[k][diff_shifted][state]\n    # k: current length of prefix being considered (0 to n)\n    # diff_shifted: (inv(p_prefix) - inv(q_prefix)) + MAX_INV_N\n    # state 0: p_prefix is lexicographically smaller than q_prefix\n    # state 1: p_prefix is lexicographically equal to q_prefix\n    # state 2: p_prefix is lexicographically greater than q_prefix\n    dp = [[[0] * 3 for _ in range(2 * MAX_INV_N + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n    # Base case: k=0 (empty prefixes), diff=0, p=q.\n    dp[0][MAX_INV_N][1] = 1\n\n    # Precompute factorials for combinations\n    fact = [1] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i - 1] * i) % mod\n\n    # Iterate k from 1 to n (length of prefix)\n    for k in range(1, n + 1):\n        # max_abs_diff_k_minus_1 = (k-1)*(k-2)//2\n        # current_max_abs_diff_k = k*(k-1)//2\n\n        # Step 1: Calculate contributions from previous states where lexicographical order was already decided (state 0 or 2).\n        # These states remain fixed in their lexicographical order.\n        # We are effectively inserting the value `k` into permutations of `1..k-1`.\n        # The recurrence `current_val(j) = current_val(j-1) + prev_val(j+k-1) + prev_val(j-k+1) - prev_val(j) - prev_val(j-1)`\n        # is for `g[k][j]` (number of pairs of permutations of `1..k` with inv diff `j`).\n        # This applies directly to `dp[k][diff][0]` and `dp[k][diff][2]` as they are just sums of previous `dp` values.\n        for state in [0, 2]:\n            prev_dp_state = dp[k-1][state]\n            current_dp_state_temp = [0] * (2 * MAX_INV_N + 1) # Temporary storage for current k, current state\n\n            for j_shifted in range(2 * MAX_INV_N + 1):\n                val = 0\n                if j_shifted > 0:\n                    val = (val + current_dp_state_temp[j_shifted-1]) % mod\n                if j_shifted + k - 1 <= 2 * MAX_INV_N:\n                    val = (val + prev_dp_state[j_shifted + k - 1]) % mod\n                if j_shifted - k + 1 >= 0:\n                    val = (val + prev_dp_state[j_shifted - k + 1]) % mod\n                val = (val - prev_dp_state[j_shifted]) % mod # Always valid as j_shifted is non-negative\n                if j_shifted - 1 >= 0:\n                    val = (val - prev_dp_state[j_shifted - 1]) % mod\n                current_dp_state_temp[j_shifted] = (val + mod) % mod\n            \n            for j_shifted in range(2 * MAX_INV_N + 1):\n                dp[k][j_shifted][state] = current_dp_state_temp[j_shifted]\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate contributions from previous state where prefixes were equal (state 1).\n        # This is where the lexicographical order can change.\n        # We are considering the k-th elements (p_k, q_k) for the permutations of 1..n.\n        # The values chosen for p_k and q_k come from the `n-(k-1)` available numbers.\n        # The number of inversions added by placing p_k or q_k also depends on their ranks among available numbers.\n        \n        # `m` is the number of values available to choose for p_k and q_k.\n        # These are the numbers not used in p_0..p_{k-1}.\n        m = n - (k - 1)\n        \n        # If m < 1, no numbers left to choose.
