Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey for Longest Repeating Substring**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this. We need to find the length of the longest substring within a given string that appears at least twice, even if those occurrences overlap. My initial thought process involves a brute-force approach, which seems like a good starting point.\n\nFirst, I'll iterate through all possible substring lengths, ranging from 1 up to the string's length minus 1. Then, for each length, I'll iterate through all possible substrings of that length within the main string. The crucial step is determining if a substring actually *repeats* within the string, and, of course, that we count for the overlaps.\n\nThe naive `string.count(substring)` function in Python won't work correctly if the repeats overlap, as it counts *non-overlapping* occurrences. I'll need a way to find all the starting indices of a given substring within the main string. If there are at least two distinct starting indices, we've got a repeat!\n\nTo handle overlaps properly, I'll use a `while` loop with `string.find()`. In each iteration, I'll find the next occurrence and move the search *one index past the start* of the previous occurrence. That way, I count for overlaps.\n\nSince we are looking for the *longest* substring, it makes sense to start with the largest possible length and work downwards. That way, the first repeating substring found will be the longest one.\n\nThe refined algorithm is as follows: Start with length `N-1` and decrease to 1. For each `length`, I'll iterate through all possible substring starting positions. For each substring, find all of its starting indices using the updated `while` loop that takes overlap into account. If we find at least two starting positions, we have a match. This is the new `max_len`, and we return. If the outer loop finishes without finding a match, that means there is no substring repeating at least twice, and we return `0`.\n\nThe trickiest part is the overlap counting, but the `start_index = found_index + 1` logic seems to be spot on to make the counting correct. I've traced the logic with multiple examples.\n\nThe time complexity could be an issue, though. The length of the string is 100 max, so the algorithm is `O(N^4)` worst-case because of nested loops, and the repeated calls of `string.find()` within the innermost loop. `N=100` might run, but could be too slow. I'll stick with it for now.\n\nLet's test it to ensure the logic works. Then, let's write the code and test the code against the sample inputs. With the `find` implementation, the `O(N^4)` solution appears solid. I'm ready to write the code.\n",
