    "thought": "**Longest Repeating Substring Algorithm**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me in the face. It's asking me to find the length of the longest substring within a given string that appears at least twice. The occurrences can overlap, which is a key detail. The string can be up to 100 characters long, and it's all lowercase Latin letters.\n\nInitially, I thought brute force might be the way to go. I'd consider every possible substring and count how many times it pops up. Since the string length is capped at 100, the nested loops for finding and comparing substrings seemed manageable, although Python's overhead gives me a slight concern.\n\nI quickly realized that checking all combinations was going to lead to an O(N^4) solution, potentially too slow for the time constraints, especially with Python's overhead. I then got an idea for optimization.\n\nI refined the brute-force approach, iterating through potential lengths in descending order. As soon as I found a substring length that worked, I could return that length, but that still feels messy. It could work, but feels awkward.\n\nThen, I had a thought. Why not iterate through all possible starting positions of substrings and compare them directly? Let's say I start at index `i` and `j` and go from there. The longest common prefix idea came into play. For each starting position, I can check for matching characters, extending the match length.\n\nThis leads to the revised algorithm that iterates with `i` and `j` and checks for a common prefix, avoiding the redundant substring counting. The beauty of it is that it's O(N^3) now. This should fit right within the time limits. I went through the solution on paper, tracing it, and it feels solid. After looking through some test cases, including edge cases, like a single character string and multiple repetitions of a character, the algorithm seems correct.\n\nI've also considered a more direct way of checking for overlapping occurrences.\n\nFinally, I'm at the point where I have the logic nailed. All that's left is to write the Python code for this triple nested loop that compares substrings to solve the problem.\n",
