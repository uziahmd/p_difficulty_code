    "thought": "**A Deep Dive into Abnormal Permutation Pairs: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this \"Abnormal Permutation Pairs\" problem. We're looking for pairs of permutations (p, q) of 1 to n, where p is lexicographically smaller than q, but the number of inversions in p is *greater* than the number of inversions in q. And we need a Python solution.\n\nMy initial thought is that brute-forcing all permutation pairs is out of the question, given the n <= 500 constraint. That's a factorial squared situation! We need a smarter strategy.\n\nI've explored several approaches:\n\n*   **Breaking down the problem:**  We know the total number of pairs. We're interested in the count where `p < q` and `inv(p) > inv(q)`. Let's define A, B, and C as the counts for the '<', '=', and '>' cases.\n*   **Total Number of Pairs is Huge:** (n!)^2 to be exact.\n*   **Inversion Calculation Complexity:** Directly calculating inversions gets messy quickly due to the `p <_lex q` constraint.\n\nI tried to use the following relations:\n*   A + B + C = ((n!)^2 - n!)/2\n*   TotalInvGreater = ((n!)^2 - TotalInvEqual)/2\n*   TotalLexLess = ((n!)^2 - n!)/2\n\nThis is where I've hit a wall. Let's try Dynamic Programming.\n\nI started thinking about DP. Keeping track of lexicographical relationships is important. My initial state space was huge:\n`dp[k][inv_p][inv_q][state]`\nI decided that keeping track of all the details was overkill.\n\n*   **Dynamic Programming (Early Attempt):** Trying to build permutations from left to right, tracking both lexicographical order and inversion counts at each step. This was becoming overly complex with the size of the maximum number of inversions.\n*   **Fixing a Differing Element:** Tried fixing the first position where p and q differ, but the combinatorial explosion with the inversions was still tough.\n*   **Simplifying Inversion Difference:** Thinking about the difference in inversions, trying to relate the count of inversion differences to find patterns or to use previous work to help.\n\nI then started thinking about fixing the first element.\nIf `p_k != q_k`, and `p < q`, then for some `k`.\nThis seems to lead to:\n`f[k][i]` = number of permutations of `k` elements with `i` inversions.\n\nI got excited that the DP for counting inversions ( `dp_inv[k][j]` ) might be useful but couldn't quite see the direct connection. I went back to try to leverage the structure of the problem to better use DP to calculate `dp[k][inv_diff][state]` with `state` = 0/1/2.\nAnd then went back to focusing on the `inv_diff` with values, still couldn't get it right because the values that are placed matter.\n\nI've hit a wall. I need a more efficient way to encode the problem's constraints into a DP state. I can get the states to calculate `dp_inv[k][j]`. The problem is making the problem's conditions to merge with `inv_diff`, and the lexicographical states.\n\nMy intuition says the key lies in either clever DP or a deeper understanding of inversion properties under lexicographical constraints. Still working on it.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count pairs of permutations `(p, q)` of `1, \\ldots, n` such that `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q` and the number of inversions in `p` is greater than the number of inversions in `q`. We need to output the answer modulo `mod`. `n` can be up to 500.\n\nLet `I(x)` denote the number of inversions in a permutation `x`.\nWe want to find `sum_{p, q : p <_lex q, I(p) > I(q)} 1`.\n\nLet's define the following quantities:\n- `A = sum_{p, q : p <_lex q, I(p) > I(q)} 1` (the desired answer).\n- `B = sum_{p, q : p <_lex q, I(p) < I(q)} 1`.\n- `C = sum_{p, q : p <_lex q, I(p) = I(q)} 1`.\n\nThe total number of pairs `(p, q)` where `p <_lex q` is `TotalLexLess = ((n!)^2 - n!) / 2`.\nSo, `A + B + C = TotalLexLess`.\n\nBy symmetry, if we swap `p` and `q` in the condition `p <_lex q, I(p) < I(q)`, we get `q <_lex p, I(q) < I(p)`. This is equivalent to `p >_lex q, I(p) > I(q)`.\nSo, `B = sum_{p, q : p >_lex q, I(p) > I(q)} 1`.\n\nConsider the total number of pairs `(p, q)` where `I(p) > I(q)`. Let this be `TotalInvGreater`.\n`TotalInvGreater = sum_{p, q : I(p) > I(q)} 1`.\nSimilarly, `TotalInvLess = sum_{p, q : I(p) < I(q)} 1`.\nAnd `TotalInvEqual = sum_{p, q : I(p) = I(q)} 1`.\nBy symmetry, `TotalInvGreater = TotalInvLess`.\nThe total number of pairs of permutations is `(n!)^2`.\nSo, `2 * TotalInvGreater + TotalInvEqual = (n!)^2`.\nThis implies `TotalInvGreater = ((n!)^2 - TotalInvEqual) / 2`.\n\nWe can write `TotalInvGreater` as the sum over all `p, q` where `I(p) > I(q)`:\n`TotalInvGreater = sum_{p, q : p <_lex q, I(p) > I(q)} 1 + sum_{p, q : p >_lex q, I(p) > I(q)} 1 + sum_{p, q : p = q, I(p) > I(q)} 1`.\nThe last term is 0 because `I(p) > I(p)` is impossible.\nSo, `TotalInvGreater = A + B`.\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n1. `A + B + C = TotalLexLess`\n2. `A + B = TotalInvGreater`\nSubstitute (2) into (1): `TotalInvGreater + C = TotalLexLess`.\nThis means `C = TotalLexLess - TotalInvGreater`.\nSubstituting `C` back into (1): `A + B + (TotalLexLess - TotalInvGreater) = TotalLexLess`.\n`A + B = TotalInvGreater`, which is consistent.\nThis shows that `A` cannot be uniquely determined from `TotalInvLess`, `TotalInvGreater`, `TotalLexLess`, `TotalLexGreater`, `C`.\n\nWe need to compute `A` directly.\nLet `dp[k][diff_inv_offset][state]` be the number of ways to choose `p_1, \\ldots, p_k` and `q_1, \\ldots, q_k` from the set of `k` smallest available numbers (i.e., `1, \\ldots, k`), such that:\n- `diff_inv_offset = I(p_1, \\ldots, p_k) - I(q_1, \\ldots, q_k) + MAX_INV`, where `MAX_INV = n(n-1)/2` is the maximum possible number of inversions for `n` elements. This offset makes the `diff_inv` non-negative.\n- `state`:\n    - `0`: `p_1, \\ldots, p_k = q_1, \\ldots, q_k`\n    - `1`: `p_1, \\ldots, p_k <_lex q_1, \\ldots, q_k`\n    - `2`: `p_1, \\ldots, p_k >_lex q_1, \\ldots, q_k`\n\nThe maximum value of `k` is `n`. The maximum `diff_inv` is `MAX_INV`, so `diff_inv_offset` ranges from `0` to `2 * MAX_INV`.\n`dp[k][diff_inv_offset][state]` stores the count of *pairs of permutations of `k` elements* that satisfy the conditions.\n\nThe base case is `dp[0][MAX_INV][0] = 1` (empty permutations, 0 inversions, 0 difference, lexicographically equal). All other `dp[0][...][...]` are 0.\n\nTo compute `dp[k][...][...]` from `dp[k-1][...][...]`:\nWe are adding the `k`-th element. This means we choose `p_k` and `q_k` from the `k` available numbers.\nThe `k` available numbers are `1, \\ldots, k`.\nWhen we place `k` into a permutation of `k-1` elements, it can be placed in `k` positions. If placed at position `j` (0-indexed, `0 \\le j < k`), it adds `j` new inversions.\n(Example: `[1,2]` has 0 inv. Insert `3`. `[3,1,2]` adds 2 inv. `[1,3,2]` adds 1 inv. `[1,2,3]` adds 0 inv.)\nThis is the standard formula for `dp_inv[k][j]`.\n\nLet `dp_inv[k][inv]` be the number of permutations of `k` elements with `inv` inversions.\n`dp_inv[k][inv] = (dp_inv[k][inv-1] + dp_inv[k-1][inv] - dp_inv[k-1][inv-k]) % mod`.\nThis can be precomputed in `O(n * MAX_INV)`.\n`MAX_INV = 500 * 499 / 2 = 124750`. `500 * 124750 \\approx 6 \\cdot 10^7`, which is feasible.\n\nNow for the main DP:\n`new_dp[diff_inv_offset][state]` will be computed from `dp[k-1][diff_inv_offset][state]`.\nFor each `prev_diff_inv_offset` and `prev_state` from `dp[k-1]`:\n  Let `count = dp[k-1][prev_diff_inv_offset][prev_state]`.\n  Let `prev_diff_inv = prev_diff_inv_offset - MAX_INV`.\n  We need to choose `p_k` and `q_k` from the `k` available positions.\n  `p_k` can be placed at any position `j_p` (0-indexed, `0 \\le j_p < k`). This adds `j_p` inversions to `p`.\n  `q_k` can be placed at any position `j_q` (0-indexed, `0 \\le j_q < k`). This adds `j_q` inversions to `q`.\n\n  Iterate `j_p` from `0` to `k-1` and `j_q` from `0` to `k-1`:\n    `current_inv_diff = prev_diff_inv + j_p - j_q`.\n    `current_diff_inv_offset = current_inv_diff + MAX_INV`.\n    \n    If `prev_state == 0` (prefixes were equal):\n      If `j_p < j_q`: `p_k` is smaller (value `k` is at `j_p`, value `k` is at `j_q`). No, this is wrong.\n      The `j_p` and `j_q` refer to the *position* where `k` is inserted.\n      If `j_p < j_q`, then `p_k` is at an earlier position than `q_k`. This means `p` is lexicographically smaller than `q`.\n      If `j_p > j_q`, then `p_k` is at a later position than `q_k`. This means `p` is lexicographically greater than `q`.\n      If `j_p = j_q`, then `p_k = q_k`. Prefixes are still equal.\n\n      So, if `prev_state == 0`:\n        If `j_p < j_q`: `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][1] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][1] + count) % mod`.\n        If `j_p > j_q`: `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][2] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][2] + count) % mod`.\n        If `j_p = j_q`: `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][0] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][0] + count) % mod`.\n    Else (`prev_state` is `1` or `2`):\n      The lexicographical relationship is already determined.\n      `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][prev_state] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][prev_state] + count) % mod`.\n\nThis DP transition is `O(k^2 * 2 * MAX_INV * 3)`. Total `O(n^3 * MAX_INV)`.\n`500^3 * 124750` is too slow. `125 * 10^6 * 1.2 * 10^5 \\approx 1.5 * 10^{13}`.\n\nThe issue is the `j_p` and `j_q` loops.\nNotice that `sum_{j_p=0}^{k-1} 1 = k`.\n`sum_{j_q=0}^{k-1} 1 = k`.\nWhen `prev_state` is `1` or `2`, we just multiply `count` by `k*k` and add to `new_dp[...][prev_state]`.\nWhen `prev_state == 0`:\n  `j_p = j_q`: `k` ways. `new_dp[prev_diff_inv_offset][0] += count * k`.\n  `j_p < j_q`: `k*(k-1)/2` ways. `new_dp[prev_diff_inv_offset][1] += count * k*(k-1)/2`.\n  `j_p > j_q`: `k*(k-1)/2` ways. `new_dp[prev_diff_inv_offset][2] += count * k*(k-1)/2`.\nThis is still not correct. The `j_p - j_q` part changes `diff_inv`.\n\nLet `S_k(diff)` be the sum of `dp_inv[k][j_p] * dp_inv[k][j_q]` such that `j_p - j_q = diff`.\nThis is `inv_counts[k]` convolved with `inv_counts[k]` (reversed).\nLet `P_k(d) = sum_{j=0}^{k-1} dp_inv[k-1][prev_j]`.\n`P_k(d)` is the number of permutations of `k` elements with `d` inversions.\nWhen we insert `k` into a permutation of `k-1` elements, say `p'`, to get `p`.\n`I(p) = I(p') + j_p`.\nSo, `dp[k][current_diff_inv_offset][state]` = sum over `prev_diff_inv_offset` and `j_p, j_q` of `dp[k-1][prev_diff_inv_offset][prev_state]`.\nThis is equivalent to `dp[k][current_diff_inv_offset][state] = sum_{prev_diff_inv_offset} dp[k-1][prev_diff_inv_offset][prev_state] * (ways to pick j_p, j_q)`.\n\nLet `dp[k][diff_inv_offset][state]` be the number of pairs of permutations `(p', q')` of `k` elements such that `I(p')-I(q') = diff_inv_offset-MAX_INV` and `p'` vs `q'` has `state`.\nWhen we go from `k-1` to `k`:\n`new_dp` array for `k`.\nFor each `prev_diff_offset` and `prev_state` in `dp[k-1]`:\n  Let `count = dp[k-1][prev_diff_offset][prev_state]`.\n  If `prev_state == 0`:\n    For `j_p` from `0` to `k-1`: (inversions added to `p`)\n      For `j_q` from `0` to `k-1`: (inversions added to `q`)\n        `current_diff_inv_offset = prev_diff_offset + j_p - j_q`.\n        If `j_p < j_q`: `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][1] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][1] + count) % mod`.\n        If `j_p > j_q`: `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][2] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][2] + count) % mod`.\n        If `j_p = j_q`: `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][0] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][0] + count) % mod`.\n  Else (`prev_state == 1` or `prev_state == 2`):\n    For `j_p` from `0` to `k-1`:\n      For `j_q` from `0` to `k-1`:\n        `current_diff_inv_offset = prev_diff_offset + j_p - j_q`.\n        `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][prev_state] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][prev_state] + count) % mod`.\n\nThe inner loops `j_p`, `j_q` can be optimized.\nFor fixed `prev_diff_offset` and `prev_state`:\n  `term_sum_jp = sum_{j_p=0}^{k-1} X^{j_p}`\n  `term_sum_jq = sum_{j_q=0}^{k-1} X^{-j_q}`\n  The contribution for `prev_state` is a polynomial `P(X) = (sum_{j_p=0}^{k-1} X^{j_p}) * (sum_{j_q=0}^{k-1} X^{-j_q})`.\n  The coefficient of `X^d` in `P(X)` is the number of pairs `(j_p, j_q)` such that `j_p - j_q = d`.\n  This is `k - |d|` for `-(k-1) \\le d \\le k-1`.\n  So, for each `d` from `-(k-1)` to `k-1`:\n    `ways = k - abs(d)`.\n    `current_diff_inv_offset = prev_diff_offset + d`.\n    If `prev_state == 0`:\n      If `d < 0`: `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][1] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][1] + count * ways) % mod`.\n      If `d > 0`: `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][2] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][2] + count * ways) % mod`.\n      If `d = 0`: `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][0] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][0] + count * ways) % mod`.\n    Else (`prev_state == 1` or `prev_state == 2`):\n      `new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][prev_state] = (new_dp[current_diff_inv_offset][prev_state] + count * ways) % mod`.\n\nThis optimized transition is `O(k * 2 * MAX_INV * 3)`.

For `N=4`, `MAX_INV = 4*3/2 = 6`.\n`dp[0][6][0] = 1`.\n`k=1`: `d` is `0`. `ways = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n`next_dp[6][0] = (0 + dp[0][6][0] * 1) = 1`.\n`dp[1][6][0] = 1`.\n`k=2`: `prev_diff_offset = 6`, `state = 0`, `count = 1`.\n  `d` from `-1` to `1`.\n  `d=-1`: `ways = 2 - 1 = 1`. `current_diff_offset = 6 - 1 = 5`. `next_dp[5][1] = (0 + 1 * 1) = 1`.\n  `d=0`: `ways = 2 - 0 = 2`. `current_diff_offset = 6 + 0 = 6`. `next_dp[6][0] = (0 + 1 * 2) = 2`.\n  `d=1`: `ways = 2 - 1 = 1`. `current_diff_offset = 6 + 1 = 7`. `next_dp[7][2] = (0 + 1 * 1) = 1`.\n`dp[2][5][1]=1, dp[2][6][0]=2, dp[2][7][2]=1`.\nAnd so on.\n\nThe sum `sum_{d=-(k-1)}^{k-1} (k-|d|) X^d` is `(sum_{j=0}^{k-1} X^j) * (sum_{j=0}^{k-1} X^{-j})`.\nThis is a polynomial multiplication.\nLet `P_k(X) = sum_{j=0}^{k-1} X^j`.\nThen `Q_k(X) = P_k(X) * P_k(X^{-1})`.\nThe coefficients of `Q_k(X)` are `(k-|d|)`.\nLet `current_poly[state]` be a polynomial where coefficient of `X^d` is `dp[k-1][d+MAX_INV][state]`.\nThen `next_poly[state_new]` can be computed by polynomial multiplication.\nThis is still `MAX_INV` terms.\nThe coefficients `k-|d|` are symmetric.\n\nThe trick must be in the `mod` not being prime.\nNo, that only affects inverse calculations, not DP complexity.\n\nThe total sum of `dp[k][diff_inv_offset][state]` for fixed `k` is `(k!)^2`.\n`dp[k][diff_inv_offset][state]` is the number of specific permutations of `1..k`.\nThis approach is correct but too slow.\n\nThe `MAX_INV` is the problem.\nNotice that the range of `diff_inv` for `k` elements is `-(k*(k-1)/2)` to `k*(k-1)/2`.\nSo `diff_inv_offset` ranges from `MAX_INV - k*(k-1)/2` to `MAX_INV + k*(k-1)/2`.\nThe actual range of `diff_inv_offset` grows.\nThe number of non-zero `diff_inv_offset` values is `k*(k-1) + 1`.\nSo the inner loop runs `2*k` times, and the outer loop runs `k*(k-1)+1` times.\nThe total complexity is `sum_{k=1}^n (k*(k-1)+1) * 3 * (2*k)`.\nThis is `O(sum k^3) = O(N^4)`.\n`500^4 = 6.25 * 10^{10}`. Still too slow.\n\nIt must be `O(N^3)` or `O(N^2 log N)` or `O(N^2)`.\n`N=500` usually means `N^2` or `N^2 log N`.\n\nLet `f[k][s]` be the number of permutations of `k` elements with `s` inversions.\n`f[k][s]` can be computed in `O(k * k^2)` if `s` is up to `k^2`.\n`f[k][s]` is `dp_inv[k][s]`.\nThe state space for `dp_inv[k][s]` is `O(k^3)`. `O(N^3)` for precomputation.\nThe maximum `s` is `k(k-1)/2`. So `O(N * N^2) = O(N^3)`.\nNo, it's `O(N * MAX_INV)`. `N * N^2 = N^3`. This is `500^3 = 1.25 * 10^8`. This is feasible.\nSo `dp_inv[k][s]` is precomputed in `O(N^3)`.\n\nLet `dp[i][j][0]` be count of pairs of permutations of `1..i` with `j` inversions each.\n`dp[i][j][1]` be count of pairs of permutations of `1..i` with `j` diff and `p <_lex q`.\n`dp[i][j][2]` be count of pairs of permutations of `1..i` with `j` diff and `p >_lex q`.\n\nThe total number of states is `N * MAX_INV * 3`.\nThe transition for each state is `O(k)`.\nSo `N * MAX_INV * 3 * N = N^2 * MAX_INV`. Still too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation might be related to the sum `sum_{d=-(k-1)}^{k-1} (k-|d|) X^d`.\nThis sum can be computed efficiently.\nFor each `prev_diff_offset`, `state`:\n  `count = dp[k-1][prev_diff_offset][state]`.\n  If `state == 0`:\n    `next_dp[prev_diff_offset][0] = (next_dp[prev_diff_offset][0] + count * k) % mod`.\n    `sum_less = sum_{d=-(k-1)}^{-1} (k-|d|)`. This is `sum_{d=1}^{k-1} (k-d) = k*(k-1) - k*(k-1)/2 = k*(k-1)/2`.\n    `next_dp[prev_diff_offset][1] = (next_dp[prev_diff_offset][1] + count * k*(k-1)/2) % mod`.\n    `next_dp[prev_diff_offset][2] = (next_dp[prev_diff_offset][2] + count * k*(k-1)/2) % mod`.\n    This is incorrect because `d` changes `diff_inv_offset`.\n\nThe `k-|d|` is the number of ways to pick `(j_p, j_q)` such that `j_p - j_q = d`.\nLet `dp[k-1][prev_diff_offset][state]` be `f`.\nWe need to compute `sum_{d=-(k-1)}^{k-1} f * (k-|d|)`.\nThis is `sum_{j_p=0}^{k-1} sum_{j_q=0}^{k-1} f`. Which is `f * k * k`.\nSo if `state` is `1` or `2`, `next_dp[prev_diff_offset + d][state] += f * (k-|d|)`.\nThis is a convolution: `next_dp[state]` becomes `current_dp[state]` convolved with `Q_k(X)`.\nConvolution takes `O(MAX_INV log MAX_INV)` using FFT.\nBut `mod` is not prime, so we need NTT or Chinese Remainder Theorem.\nThe `MAX_INV` is too large for NTT. `2*MAX_INV` is `250000`.\n\nThe problem is similar to \"Counting Permutations with Inversion Constraints\".\nThe maximum number of inversions for `n` elements is `n*(n-1)/2`.\nFor `n=500`, this is `124750`.\nThe range for `diff_inv` is `[-124750, 124750]`.\nThe size of `dp` array for `diff_inv_offset` is `2*124750 + 1 = 249501`.\nLet `D = 2*MAX_INV+1`.\nThe DP transition is `O(N * D * N) = O(N^2 * MAX_INV)`.\n\nLet's check the constraints again. `N=500`.\n`N^2` is `250000`. `N^3` is `1.25 * 10^8`.\n`N^2 * MAX_INV` is `250000 * 124750 \\approx 3 * 10^{10}`.\n`N^4` is `6.25 * 10^{10}`.\n\nMy complexity analysis of `O(N^4)` for the DP transition from `k-1` to `k` was `sum_{k=1}^n (k*(k-1)+1) * 3 * (2*k)`.\nThis is `sum_{k=1}^n O(k^2 * k) = sum_{k=1}^n O(k^3) = O(N^4)`.\nThis is the correct complexity for the DP approach. `N=500` makes `N^4` too slow.\n\nThe problem could be solved by `O(N^3)` or `O(N^2 log N)`.\nThis implies that the `MAX_INV` part must be replaced by something `O(N)`.\nThis is possible if the `diff_inv` range is `O(N)`. But it's not.\nThe problem is hard.\n\nIt is possible that the solution is `O(N^3)` or `O(N^2 log N)` if we only sum over `diff_inv` in a small range around `0`.\nBut we need to sum over all `diff_inv`.\n\nFinal check for `N=4`:\n`MAX_INV = 6`. `diff_inv_offset` ranges `0..12`.\n`dp[0][6][0] = 1`.\n`k=1`: `d=0`, `ways=1`. `dp[1][6][0] = 1`.\n`k=2`: `prev_diff_offset=6, state=0, count=1`.\n  `d=-1`: `ways=1`. `dp[2][5][1] = 1`.\n  `d=0`: `ways=2`. `dp[2][6][0] = 2`.\n  `d=1`: `ways=1`. `dp[2][7][2] = 1`.\n`k=3`:\n  `prev_diff_offset=5, state=1, count=1`. `d=-2..2`.\n    `d=-2`: `ways=1`. `dp[3][3][1] += 1*1 = 1`.\n    `d=-1`: `ways=2`. `dp[3][4][1] += 1*2 = 2`.\n    `d=0`: `ways=3`. `dp[3][5][1] += 1*3 = 3`.\n    `d=1`: `ways=2`. `dp[3][6][1] += 1*2 = 2`.\n    `d=2`: `ways=1`. `dp[3][7][1] += 1*1 = 1`.\n  `prev_diff_offset=6, state=0, count=2`. `d=-2..2`.\n    `d=-2`: `ways=1`. `dp[3][4][1] += 2*1 = 2`.\n    `d=-1`: `ways=2`. `dp[3][5][1] += 2*2 = 4`.\n    `d=0`: `ways=3`. `dp[3][6][0] += 2*3 = 6`.\n    `d=1`: `ways=2`. `dp[3][7][2] += 2*2 = 4`.\n    `d=2`: `ways=1`. `dp[3][8][2] += 2*1 = 2`.\n  `prev_diff_offset=7, state=2, count=1`. `d=-2..2`.\n    `d=-2`: `ways=1`. `dp[3][5][2] += 1*1 = 1`.\n    `d=-1`: `ways=2`. `dp[3][6][2] += 1*2 = 2`.\n    `d=0`: `ways=3`. `dp[3][7][2] += 1*3 = 3`.\n    `d=1`: `ways=2`. `dp[3][8][2] += 1*2 = 2`.\n    `d=2`: `ways=1`. `dp[3][9][2] += 1*1 = 1`.\n`dp[3][3][1]=1, dp[3][4][1]=4, dp[3][5][1]=7, dp[3][6][1]=2, dp[3][7][1]=1`.\n`dp[3][6][0]=6`.\n`dp[3][5][2]=1, dp[3][6][2]=2, dp[3][7][2]=7, dp[3][8][2]=4, dp[3][9][2]=1`.\n\nThis is the standard `O(N^4)` solution. If `N=500` and `N^4` passes, it's a very generous time limit or the constant factor is extremely small.\n`6.25 * 10^{10}` operations is too much for 1-2 seconds.\nThe only way `N^4` could pass is if `MAX_INV` was `N`, not `N^2`.\n\nMaybe there's some property of `dp[k][diff_inv_offset][state]` that allows for faster computation of the sum `sum_{d=-(k-1)}^{k-1} (k-|d|) * dp[k-1][prev_diff_offset][state]` for all `prev_diff_offset`.\nThis is a convolution `f * g`, where `g` has `2k-1` non-zero terms.\n`f` has `k^2` non-zero terms.\nThis can be computed in `O(MAX_INV * k)`.\nSo for each `state`, we do `O(MAX_INV * k)` convolution. Total `O(N * MAX_INV * k) = O(N^2 * MAX_INV)`.\nThis is `O(N^4)`. My previous analysis was correct.\n\nThe solution must be `O(N^3)`.\nIf `MAX_INV` were `N`, then `N * N * N = N^3`.\nThe `MAX_INV` term is the problem.\nPerhaps the range of `diff_inv` that contributes to the final answer is limited?\nNo, `diff_inv` can be anything from `1` to `MAX_INV`.\n\nConsider the problem `sum_{p, q, I(p) > I(q)} 1`. This is `((n!)^2 - sum f[n][i]^2)/2`.\nThis is `O(N^3)`.\nThe problem is the `p <_lex q` condition.\n\nMaybe there is a trick to avoid storing all `diff_inv` values.\nThe maximum value of `diff_inv` is `n*(n-1)/2`.\nThe number of elements `k` is up to `n`.\nThe number of inversions for `k` elements is `k*(k-1)/2`.\nThe difference `diff_inv` for `k` elements is `k*(k-1)/2`.\nThe range of `diff_inv_offset` is `(MAX_INV - k*(k-1)/2)` to `(MAX_INV + k*(k-1)/2)`.\nThe length of this active range is `k*(k-1)+1`.\nSo the transition is `O(k^2 * k) = O(k^3)`.\nSumming `k^3` from `1` to `N` gives `O(N^4)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, mod = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    MAX_INV = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    \n    # dp_inv[k][inv] stores the number of permutations of k elements with inv inversions\n    # This is precomputed using the standard DP relation:\n    # dp_inv[k][inv] = (dp_inv[k][inv-1] + dp_inv[k-1][inv] - dp_inv[k-1][inv-k]) % mod\n    # with dp_inv[k][0] = 1 for all k.\n    # We need dp_inv up to n elements.\n    # Max inversions for k elements is k*(k-1)//2.\n    # For optimization, we can use only two rows for dp_inv.\n    \n    # dp_inv[inv] for current k\n    # prev_dp_inv[inv] for k-1\n    dp_inv_current = [0] * (MAX_INV + 1)\n    prev_dp_inv = [0] * (MAX_INV + 1)\n    prev_dp_inv[0] = 1 # Base case: 0 elements, 0 inversions, 1 way\n\n    # Max range for diff_inv_offset is 2 * MAX_INV + 1\n    # dp[diff_inv_offset][state]\n    # state 0: p_prefix == q_prefix\n    # state 1: p_prefix <_lex q_prefix\n    # state 2: p_prefix >_lex q_prefix\n    \n    # Initialize dp table for k=0\n    dp = [[0, 0, 0] for _ in range(2 * MAX_INV + 1)]\n    dp[MAX_INV][0] = 1 # 0 elements, diff_inv = 0, equal, 1 way\n\n    # Iterate k from 1 to n\n    for k in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate dp_inv for current k\n        max_inv_k = k * (k - 1) // 2\n        dp_inv_current[0] = 1\n        for inv_val in range(1, max_inv_k + 1):\n            val = (prev_dp_inv[inv_val] + dp_inv_current[inv_val - 1]) % mod\n            if inv_val - k >= 0:\n                val = (val - prev_dp_inv[inv_val - k]) % mod\n            dp_inv_current[inv_val] = val\n        \n        # Prepare for next iteration of dp_inv\n        for i in range(max_inv_k + 1):\n            prev_dp_inv[i] = dp_inv_current[i]\n        for i in range(max_inv_k + 1, MAX_INV + 1): # Clear remaining part\n            prev_dp_inv[i] = 0\n\n        # Create a new dp table for current k\n        next_dp = [[0, 0, 0] for _ in range(2 * MAX_INV + 1)]\n\n        # The range of diff_inv_offset for k-1 elements\n        # max_inv_k_minus_1 = (k-1)*(k-2)//2\n        # min_prev_diff_offset = MAX_INV - max_inv_k_minus_1\n        # max_prev_diff_offset = MAX_INV + max_inv_k_minus_1\n\n        # Iterate over previous states\n        for prev_diff_offset in range(2 * MAX_INV + 1):\n            for state in range(3):\n                count = dp[prev_diff_offset][state]\n                if count == 0:\n                    continue\n                \n                # Iterate over possible inversions added by k for p and q\n                # d = j_p - j_q, where j_p, j_q are number of new inversions (0 to k-1)\n                # ways = k - abs(d)\n                for d in range(-(k - 1), k): # d from -(k-1) to k-1\n                    ways = k - abs(d)\n                    \n                    current_diff_offset = prev_diff_offset + d\n                    \n                    if not (0 <= current_diff_offset <= 2 * MAX_INV):\n                        continue # Should not happen if MAX_INV is correctly calculated and diff_inv range is handled\n                    \n                    if state == 0: # Prefixes were equal\n                        if d < 0: # p_k < q_k (lexicographically)\n                            next_dp[current_diff_offset][1] = (next_dp[current_diff_offset][1] + count * ways) % mod\n                        elif d > 0: # p_k > q_k\n                            next_dp[current_diff_offset][2] = (next_dp[current_diff_offset][2] + count * ways) % mod\n                        else: # d == 0, p_k == q_k\n                            next_dp[current_diff_offset][0] = (next_dp[current_diff_offset][0] + count * ways) % mod\n                    else: # Lexicographical order already determined\n                        next_dp[current_diff_offset][state] = (next_dp[current_diff_offset][state] + count * ways) % mod\n        \n        dp = next_dp # Update dp for current k\n\n    # Sum up the counts for p <_lex q and I(p) > I(q)\n    ans = 0\n    for diff_inv in range(1, MAX_INV + 1):\n        ans = (ans + dp[MAX_INV + diff_inv][1]) % mod\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(str(ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
