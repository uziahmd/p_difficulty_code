The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Xenia and Ringroad Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break it down. I need a Python script to figure out the minimum time Xenia needs to complete her tasks.\n\nFirst, I've got my parameters: `n`, which is the number of houses, ranging from 2 to 10<sup>5</sup>, and `m`, the number of tasks, also up to 10<sup>5</sup>. Each task, represented by `a_i`, corresponds to a house Xenia needs to visit, in sequence. She starts at house 1 and can only move clockwise. The time to move between neighboring houses is 1 unit.\n\nThe key is that to do a task at house `a_i`, she has to have completed all previous tasks. So, it's a matter of calculating the time to get from her current house to the target house for each task, and summing it all up.\n\nI've walked through the example: `n = 4`, `tasks = [3, 2, 3]`.  Starting at house 1, I had to move to house 3 (2 units), then from 3 to 2 (3 units), and finally from 2 to 3 (1 unit). That gave me a total time of 6.\n\nNow, let's nail down the logic for calculating the time between any two houses. If the `target_house` is greater than or equal to the `current_house`, it's simple:  just the difference, `target_house - current_house`.  But if the `target_house` is smaller, it's a wrap-around case. She has to go from her current house, all the way around the ring to get to the lower house number.\n\nI figured out the formula: `n - current_house + target_house`. I need to ensure that works for all cases. The example case seemed correct. I'm confident now that I have a solid understanding of how to find the path length. Time to write some code!\n",
