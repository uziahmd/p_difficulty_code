You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing a Number After Digit Replacement**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. The core of it is a greedy approach. I need to take a number, `a`, and replace some of its digits with digits from a sequence, `s`, to get the largest possible number. The key is to make the *most significant* digits as large as possible.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking about it:\n\n1.  **Preparation**: First, I'll convert `a` into a list of characters since it needs to be modified. Then, I will convert `s` to a list of characters and sort it in descending order.\n\n2.  **Greedy Replacement**: I'll iterate through `a` from left to right. At each position, I'll try to find the biggest digit from `s` that can replace the current digit in `a`. If the largest remaining digit from `s` is greater than the current digit in `a`, I'll make the replacement and move on to the next digit in `s`. If the digit from `s` is not bigger, I'll leave the digit in `a` as it is. I'm choosing not to replace if the largest available is not greater, because if I replace with that, or a smaller number, it will be worse. In this greedy approach, if the number in `s` is not greater, then move to the next iteration of `a` without making a change. I need a pointer to track the largest available digit in `s`.\n\nI keep the code clean and well-structured, making sure that it does exactly what I need and nothing more. This will handle all test cases correctly.",
