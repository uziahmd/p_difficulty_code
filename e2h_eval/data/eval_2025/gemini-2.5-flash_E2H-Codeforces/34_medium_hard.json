And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Optimal Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core challenge is to efficiently compute the average sleep time across all possible \"weeks,\" where a \"week\" is a consecutive block of `k` days from a given sleep record of `n` days. My initial instinct is to go for something faster than `O(n*k)`.\n\nFirst, I define my variables clearly: `n` is the number of sleep records, `k` is the window size for the \"week,\" and `a` is the array containing the sleep times. The number of possible weeks is then `n - k + 1`. The average sleep time is the total sleep time divided by the number of weeks.\n\nThe direct approach, calculating the sum of sleep times for each week separately, would be too slow, leading to a complexity of O(n*k). Thus, a sliding window technique immediately comes to mind.  I need to calculate the sum of the first week and store it. Then, for each subsequent week, I update the sum by subtracting the oldest element of the current week and adding the new element at the end of the window. This reduces the complexity to O(n), which is much better.\n\nFor implementation, I'll calculate the sum of the first `k` elements initially. Then, in the main loop, I’ll subtract `a[i-1]` and add `a[i+k-1]` to maintain the sum of the current window. At each iteration, the updated sum is added to the total sum. The average is then just `total_sum / (n - k + 1)`.\n\nThe crucial part is the iteration boundaries. Since the first window starts at index `0`, the last window starts at index `n - k`. So I will iterate from `1` up to `n - k`. I must make sure the indices of the added and removed elements are correct.\n\nData type considerations are also important. The maximum value for each sleep time is `10^5`. With `n = 2 * 10^5` and, potentially all the `a[i]` are equal to `10^5` when `k = 1`, the maximum sum can reach `2 * 10^{10}`. This will be an easily handled integer for Python's arbitrary-precision integers, and the final average calculation will be done with the appropriate floating-point type for the desired precision.\n\nLet me go through an example to verify my logic. If n=3, k=2, and a=[3, 4, 7]: There are 2 weeks. The first is 3+4=7. The second is 4+7=11. The sum is 18, and the average is 9.0.\n\nSeems to be correct. Let's make sure the sliding window logic and index calculation is perfect. I must avoid index-out-of-bounds errors.\n\nI will also make sure the output has the specified precision.\n",
