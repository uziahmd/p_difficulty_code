He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down \"Polycarp's Practice\" for a Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Polycarp's Practice\" problem, and my immediate thought is, \"How can I get a clean Python solution for this?\" I see the core of the problem: we have `n` problems to solve across `k` days, each day tackling a contiguous chunk of problems. The \"profit\" of a day is the hardest problem solved that day, and we're after the *maximum* total profit across all days.\n\nThe example really clarifies the goal. We have this list of problem difficulties, and the optimal solution finds these segments where the maximum of each segment is, ideally, a large value. It immediately clicked: to maximize that total profit, we absolutely need to get those top `k` hardest problems to *be* the daily maximums. We can't exceed their sum, because the maximum daily profit can never exceed the hardest problem within the dataset.\n\nMy next thought process is focused on achieving this ideal split. I need to find the `k` largest difficulties and their positions. Sorting them gives me their sum (the maximum total profit), but I also need their original indices. That's the key. Knowing where these difficult problems were in the *original* list will guide how I create those problem segments for each day.\n\nSo, the plan unfolds: I'll sort the problem difficulties to get the maximum possible sum. Then, I'll need to use their original indices to ensure I split the problems *around* these key values, making sure each of the `k` days has a large problem at its heart. I'm thinking of a loop, or maybe a recursive helper function to build these segments, ensuring that each \"daily maximum\" is one of the `k` largest problems.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to divide `n` problems, given as a list of difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n`, into `k` contiguous segments. Each segment represents problems solved on one day. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved that day. We want to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output this maximum profit, along with the number of problems solved each day.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nTo maximize the sum of `k` daily profits, we should try to make each day's profit as large as possible. The largest possible values for these profits are the `k` largest problem difficulties in the entire list `a`. If we can arrange the segments such that each of these `k` largest difficulties becomes the maximum for one day's segment, then their sum will be the maximum possible total profit. This is because any daily profit must be one of the `a_i` values, and we are picking the `k` largest available `a_i` values.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Find the `k` largest difficulties:**\n    *   Create a list of tuples `(difficulty, original_index)` for all problems.\n    *   Sort this list in descending order based on difficulty.\n    *   Take the top `k` elements from this sorted list. These are the `k` largest difficulties.\n    *   The sum of these `k` difficulties will be our maximum total profit.\n\n2.  **Determine segment boundaries:**\n    *   From the `k` largest difficulties identified in step 1, collect their original indices.\n    *   Sort these `k` indices in ascending order. These sorted indices `idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_k` will represent the *last problem* of each of the first `k-1` days, and the last problem of the `k`-th day will always be `n-1` (the last problem in the list).\n    *   Let the sorted indices be `p_1, p_2, ..., p_k`. These are the 0-indexed positions of the `k` problems that will serve as the maximums for their respective days.\n\n3.  **Calculate daily problem counts:**\n    *   The first day will solve problems from index `0` to `p_1`. The number of problems is `p_1 + 1`.\n    *   The second day will solve problems from index `p_1 + 1` to `p_2`. The number of problems is `p_2 - (p_1 + 1) + 1 = p_2 - p_1`.\n    *   In general, for day `j` (where `j > 1`), it solves problems from index `p_{j-1} + 1` to `p_j`. The number of problems is `p_j - p_{j-1}`.\n    *   The last day (`k`-th day) will solve problems from index `p_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1`. The number of problems is `(n-1) - (p_{k-1} + 1) + 1 = n - p_{k-1} - 1`.\n    *   However, a simpler way to think about it is to use the `k-1` split points.\n        *   The first split point is after problem `p_1`. So day 1 solves `p_1 + 1` problems.\n        *   The second split point is after problem `p_2`. So day 2 solves problems from `p_1 + 1` to `p_2`, which is `p_2 - p_1` problems.\n        *   ...\n        *   The `(k-1)`-th split point is after problem `p_{k-1}`. So day `k-1` solves `p_{k-1} - p_{k-2}` problems.\n        *   The `k`-th day solves all remaining problems, from `p_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1`. The number of problems is `n - (p_{k-1} + 1) = n - p_{k-1} - 1`.\n    *   This approach works for `k > 1`. If `k = 1`, there's only one day, and it solves all `n` problems.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Find `k` largest difficulties:**\n    *   Problems with indices: `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n    *   Sorted by difficulty (descending): `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n    *   Top `k=3` difficulties: `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`.\n    *   Maximum total profit: `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n\n2.  **Determine segment boundaries:**\n    *   Original indices of these top `k` problems: `6, 3, 0`.\n    *   Sorted indices: `0, 3, 6`. These are `p_1=0, p_2=3, p_3=6`.\n\n3.  **Calculate daily problem counts:**\n    *   The split points are after `p_1=0` and `p_2=3`.\n    *   Day 1: problems from index `0` to `p_1=0`. Count: `p_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n        *   Wait, this is wrong. The problem example says `[5,4,2]`. The index `0` is `5`. If `5` is the max, it must be included in the first day. If we only solve `[5]`, then `[4,2]` are left.\n        *   The sorted indices `p_1, ..., p_k` are the indices of the *chosen maximum problems*. These problems must be part of *some* day's segment.\n        *   Let's use the `k-1` split points to define the segments. The `k` problems with largest difficulties (and their indices) are `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`. Their indices are `0, 3, 6` when sorted.\n        *   These `k` indices are where the \"maximum\" problems are.\n        *   These `k` problems must fall into `k` *different* segments.\n        *   The last problem of day `j` must be `p_j` or later.\n        *   The simplest way to form `k` segments that include these `k` problems as their maximums is to make `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1}` the *last index* of the first `k-1` days. The `k`-th day then takes all remaining problems up to `n-1`.\n\n    Let `sorted_indices` be `[0, 3, 6]`.\n    *   The first `k-1` split points are determined by `sorted_indices[0], ..., sorted_indices[k-2]`.\n    *   Day 1: problems from `0` up to `sorted_indices[0]`. Count: `sorted_indices[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    *   Day 2: problems from `sorted_indices[0] + 1` up to `sorted_indices[1]`. Count: `sorted_indices[1] - sorted_indices[0] = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n    *   Day 3 (last day): problems from `sorted_indices[1] + 1` up to `n-1`. Count: `n - (sorted_indices[1] + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 8 - 4 = 4`.\n    *   This gives `[1, 3, 4]`. Total `1+3+4=8`.\n    *   Let's check the profits:\n        *   Day 1: `[5]`. Max = `5`.\n        *   Day 2: `[4, 2, 6]`. Max = `6`.\n        *   Day 3: `[5, 1, 9, 2]`. Max = `9`.\n        *   Total profit: `5 + 6 + 9 = 20`. This matches the example's total profit.\n        *   However, the example output for problem counts is `3 2 3`. This means there can be multiple valid ways to achieve the maximum profit.\n\n    The example's distribution `[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]` has splits after index `2` and index `4`.\n    The chosen maximums for these days are `a[0]=5`, `a[3]=6`, `a[6]=9`. Their indices are `0, 3, 6`.\n    The split points are `2` and `4`.\n    Notice that `0 <= 2`, `3 <= 4`, `6 <= 7`. This is valid.\n\n    **Revised strategy for daily problem counts:**\n    The `k` sorted indices `p_1, p_2, ..., p_k` (from step 2) are the *guaranteed* problems that will be maximums.\n    We need to make `k-1` cuts. These cuts must be placed *after* `p_1`, *after* `p_2`, ..., *after* `p_{k-1}`.\n    To ensure each of the `k` largest problems falls into a *different* segment and becomes its maximum, we can make the cuts right after `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1}`.\n    No, this is not correct. The `p_i` are the *indices of the problems whose values will be the daily maximums*.\n    The crucial part is that `p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k` are the indices of the `k` largest values.\n    We need to make `k-1` cuts. The first cut must be after `p_1` (or earlier if `p_1` is the first element), the second after `p_2`, etc.\n    A simple way to guarantee that these `k` problems are the maximums for their segments is to make cuts *just after* `k-1` of these `k` problems (excluding the last one).\n\n    Let the sorted indices of the `k` largest elements be `idx_0, idx_1, ..., idx_{k-1}`.\n    The first day ends at some position `e_0`.\n    The second day ends at some position `e_1`.\n    ...\n    The `(k-1)`-th day ends at some position `e_{k-2}`.\n    The `k`-th day ends at `n-1`.\n\n    We need to pick `k-1` unique indices from `idx_0, ..., idx_{k-1}` to be the split points.\n    A valid strategy is to use `idx_0, idx_1, ..., idx_{k-2}` as the points where we make a cut.\n    So, the first day ends at `idx_0`. The number of problems is `idx_0 + 1`.\n    The second day ends at `idx_1`. The number of problems is `idx_1 - idx_0`.\n    ...\n    The `(k-1)`-th day ends at `idx_{k-2}`. The number of problems is `idx_{k-2} - idx_{k-3}`.\n    The `k`-th day takes all remaining problems, from `idx_{k-2} + 1` to `n-1`. The number of problems is `n - (idx_{k-2} + 1)`.\n\n    Let's re-apply this to `n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`.\n    Sorted indices of top 3: `[0, 3, 6]`.\n    `idx_0 = 0`, `idx_1 = 3`, `idx_2 = 6`.\n    We need `k-1 = 2` split points. These will be `idx_0` and `idx_1`.\n    *   Day 1 ends at `idx_0 = 0`. Problems: `0 + 1 = 1`. (`[5]`)\n    *   Day 2 ends at `idx_1 = 3`. Problems: `idx_1 - idx_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`. (`[4, 2, 6]`)\n    *   Day 3 ends at `n-1 = 7`. Problems: `n - (idx_1 + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 4`. (`[5, 1, 9, 2]`)\n    *   Output: `20`, `1 3 4`.\n    This is different from the example output `3 2 3`, but it yields the same total profit. The problem states \"If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\" So this is a valid solution.\n\n**Refined Algorithm for Daily Problem Counts:**\n1.  Get the `k` largest difficulties and their original indices.\n2.  Calculate the total profit by summing these `k` difficulties.\n3.  Store the original indices of these `k` difficulties in a list called `split_indices`.\n4.  Sort `split_indices` in ascending order.\n5.  Initialize `day_lengths = []`.\n6.  Initialize `current_start_index = 0`.\n7.  Iterate `j` from `0` to `k-2` (for the first `k-1` days):\n    *   The `j`-th day will end at `split_indices[j]`.\n    *   The number of problems for this day is `split_indices[j] - current_start_index + 1`.\n    *   Add this length to `day_lengths`.\n    *   Update `current_start_index = split_indices[j] + 1` for the next day.\n8.  For the last (`k`-th) day:\n    *   It takes all remaining problems from `current_start_index` to `n-1`.\n    *   The number of problems is `n - current_start_index`.\n    *   Add this length to `day_lengths`.\n\n**Example 1: `n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`**\n1.  `k` largest difficulties: `9, 6, 5`. Total profit = `20`.\n2.  Indices of these difficulties: `6, 3, 0`.\n3.  `split_indices = [0, 3, 6]`.\n4.  `day_lengths = []`. `current_start_index = 0`.\n5.  Loop `j = 0` (for day 1):\n    *   Day 1 ends at `split_indices[0] = 0`.\n    *   Length: `0 - 0 + 1 = 1`. `day_lengths = [1]`.\n    *   `current_start_index = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n6.  Loop `j = 1` (for day 2):\n    *   Day 2 ends at `split_indices[1] = 3`.\n    *   Length: `3 - 1 + 1 = 3`. `day_lengths = [1, 3]`.\n    *   `current_start_index = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n7.  Last day (`k=3`):\n    *   Length: `n - current_start_index = 8 - 4 = 4`. `day_lengths = [1, 3, 4]`.\n8.  Output: `20`, `1 3 4`.\n\nThis approach is simpler and always works. The crucial part is that each of the `k` largest values `a[idx_j]` must be included in *some* day's segment, and by making the cuts after `idx_0, ..., idx_{k-2}`, we ensure that `a[idx_j]` is included in day `j+1` (for `j < k-1`) or day `k` (for `j = k-1`). Since `a[idx_j]` is one of the `k` overall largest values, and we've isolated it into a segment that starts *after* previous chosen maximums and ends *at or before* subsequent chosen maximums, it is guaranteed to be the maximum in its segment.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   `k = 1`: `split_indices` will have one element. The loop for `j` from `0` to `k-2` won't run. `current_start_index` remains `0`. The last day calculates `n - 0 = n`. Correct.\n*   `k = n`: Each day solves one problem. `split_indices` will be `[0, 1, ..., n-1]`.\n    *   Day 1 ends at `split_indices[0] = 0`. Length `1`. `current_start_index = 1`.\n    *   Day 2 ends at `split_indices[1] = 1`. Length `1 - 1 + 1 = 1`. `current_start_index = 2`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `n-1` ends at `split_indices[n-2] = n-2`. Length `1`. `current_start_index = n-1`.\n    *   Last day (`n`-th day): Length `n - (n-1) = 1`.\n    *   Result: `[1, 1, ..., 1]` (`n` times). Correct.\n\n**Constraints:**\n`1 <= k <= n <= 2000`\n`1 <= a_i <= 2000`\nThe solution involves sorting `n` elements (or `k` elements), which is `O(N log N)` or `O(N log K)`. Iterating through `k` elements is `O(K)`. Overall time complexity is dominated by sorting, `O(N log N)`. Given `N=2000`, `N log N` is well within limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Find the k largest difficulties and their original indices\n    # Store as (difficulty, original_index) tuples\n    problems_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        problems_with_indices.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort by difficulty in descending order\n    problems_with_indices.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Take the top k problems\n    top_k_problems = problems_with_indices[:k]\n\n    # Calculate maximum total profit\n    max_total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in top_k_problems)\n    print(max_total_profit)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Determine segment boundaries and calculate daily problem counts\n    # Get the original indices of these top k problems\n    split_indices = sorted([p[1] for p in top_k_problems])\n\n    day_lengths = []\n    current_start_index = 0\n\n    # For the first k-1 days, make cuts right after the first k-1 chosen max problems\n    for j in range(k - 1):\n        # The j-th day ends at split_indices[j]\n        # Number of problems for this day is (split_indices[j] - current_start_index + 1)\n        day_lengths.append(split_indices[j] - current_start_index + 1)\n        current_start_index = split_indices[j] + 1 # Next day starts after this split\n\n    # The last (k-th) day takes all remaining problems\n    day_lengths.append(n - current_start_index)\n\n    print(*(day_lengths))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
