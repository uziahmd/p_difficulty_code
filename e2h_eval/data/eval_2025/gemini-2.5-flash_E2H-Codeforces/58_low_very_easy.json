You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through This Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this graph problem. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of edges, which I'm calling `t`, I need to add to this graph to create an odd-length cycle. I also need to figure out how many different ways, `w`, I can do this. Seems straightforward enough at first glance, but I know these competitive programming problems can have some hidden subtleties.\n\nMy first thought is always to break down the core conditions. A graph has an odd cycle if and only if it's not bipartite. So, I need to start by checking if the existing graph *already* has an odd cycle. If it does, great! Then `t` is 0, and `w` is simply 1, because I don't need to do anything. The \"do-nothing\" is a valid option.\n\nTo check for an odd cycle, I'll need to use either Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) and do a 2-coloring – essentially, checking if the graph is bipartite. For each connected component, I'll start with an arbitrary vertex, color it, and then propagate colors along the edges. If I encounter an edge where the connected vertices have the same color, bam, I've found an odd cycle. If I iterate through all the components and *never* find an odd cycle, then the whole graph is bipartite.\n\nNow, if the graph *is* bipartite, I need to add edges to create an odd cycle. This means I need to consider `t > 0`. Since it's bipartite, each connected component can be 2-colored, partitioning the vertices into two sets, which I'll call `L` and `R`, where edges only go between sets, never within them.\n\nMy mind immediately jumps to the minimum possible number of edges. What if `t = 1`? Can I create an odd cycle by adding just *one* edge? It turns out, yes, I can. I need to find two vertices, `u` and `v`, that are in the *same* connected component but have the *same* color in the 2-coloring. If I add an edge between them, I've created an odd cycle! The existing path between `u` and `v` will be of even length because they have the same color in the 2-coloring and adding the edge results in the odd cycle.\n\nSo, if `t` *is* 1, I need to count how many such pairs `(u, v)` I can find. That count will be my `w`, the number of ways to add one edge and form an odd cycle. I have to be careful about not counting existing edges as candidates. It seems I'll need to focus on each connected component individually and count those same-colored vertex pairs.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w`, the number of ways to do so.\n\nA graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. We can check if a graph is bipartite using a 2-coloring algorithm (like BFS or DFS).\n\nLet's categorize the problem based on the value of `t`.\n\n**Step 1: Check if the graph already contains an odd cycle (t = 0).**\nWe can do this by attempting to 2-color each connected component of the graph.\nInitialize all vertices as uncolored. Iterate through each vertex `v` from 1 to `n`. If `v` is uncolored:\n  Start a BFS/DFS from `v`, assigning `v` color 0.\n  For each neighbor `u` of the current vertex `curr`:\n    If `u` is uncolored: assign `u` the opposite color of `curr` and add `u` to the queue/stack.\n    If `u` is colored and `color[u] == color[curr]`: an odd cycle is found.\nIf an odd cycle is found in any connected component, then `t = 0` and `w = 1`. We can print `0 1` and terminate.\n\n**Step 2: If the graph is bipartite (all connected components are bipartite), then t > 0.**\nIn this case, we need to add edges to create an odd cycle.\nFor each connected component, the 2-coloring partitions its vertices into two sets, say `L` and `R`, such that all existing edges connect a vertex in `L` to a vertex in `R`.\n\n**Case 2.1: t = 1**\nWe can form an odd cycle by adding a single edge `(u, v)` if `u` and `v` are in the same connected component and have the same color (e.g., both in `L` or both in `R`). If we add such an edge, it closes an even-length path between `u` and `v` (since they are in the same partition set of a bipartite graph), forming an odd cycle. This added edge must not be an existing edge.\n\nTo find `w` for `t=1`:\nFor each connected component `C` that is bipartite:\n  Let `|L_C|` be the number of vertices in color set 0 and `|R_C|` be the number of vertices in color set 1.\n  The number of pairs of vertices `(u, v)` with `u, v` in `L_C` is `|L_C| * (|L_C| - 1) / 2`.\n  The number of pairs of vertices `(u, v)` with `u, v` in `R_C` is `|R_C| * (|R_C| - 1) / 2`.\n  The total number of potential single edges that could form an odd cycle within `C` is `|L_C| * (|L_C| - 1) / 2 + |R_C| * (|R_C| - 1) / 2`.\n  From this count, we must subtract any existing edges that connect two vertices of the same color. However, since the component is bipartite, there are no such existing edges. So, the count is simply the sum of combinations.\n\nSum these counts over all connected components. This sum gives `w` for `t = 1`.\nIf `w > 0`, then `t = 1`. Print `1 w` and terminate.\n\n**Case 2.2: t = 2**\nIf `t = 1` is not possible (i.e., all connected components have size 1, or size 2 with 1 edge, so no two vertices of the same color exist), then we need at least `t = 2` edges.\nThis happens if all connected components are trees or isolated vertices, and none of them have at least 3 vertices (which would allow `t=1`). More precisely, `t=1` is not possible if for every component `C`, `|L_C| <= 1` or `|R_C| <= 1`. This means all components are paths or stars, and specifically, if `|L_C| >= 2` *and* `|R_C| >= 2` for some component, then `t=1` is possible.\nIf `t=1` is not possible, we consider `t=2`.\nTo form an odd cycle with two added edges, we must connect two different connected components.\nSuppose we have two distinct connected components, `C1` and `C2`.\n`C1` has partitions `L1, R1`. `C2` has partitions `L2, R2`.\nWe can add two edges `(u1, u2)` and `(v1, v2)` such that `u1, v1` are in `C1` and `u2, v2` are in `C2`.\nTo form an odd cycle, we need `u1` and `v1` to have different colors, and `u2` and `v2` to have different colors. This is always true if `u1,v1` are distinct and `u2,v2` are distinct.\nThe length of the path from `u1` to `v1` in `C1` is odd. The length of the path from `u2` to `v2` in `C2` is odd.\nAdding `(u1, u2)` and `(v1, v2)` forms a cycle of length `len(u1..v1) + 1 + len(u2..v2) + 1`. This is `odd + 1 + odd + 1 = even + even = even`. This does not form an odd cycle.\n\nTo form an odd cycle, we need to connect `u1` and `u2` such that `color[u1]` and `color[u2]` are different, and `v1` and `v2` such that `color[v1]` and `color[v2]` are different.\nConsider adding edges `(u1, u2)` and `(v1, v2)` where `u1 \\in L1, u2 \\in L2, v1 \\in R1, v2 \\in R2`.\nThe path `u1 -- u2 -- v2 -- v1 -- u1` forms a cycle.\nThe path `u1 -- v1` in `C1` has odd length.\nThe path `u2 -- v2` in `C2` has odd length.\nThe cycle length is `len(u1..v1) + 1 + len(v2..u2) + 1 = odd + 1 + odd + 1 = even + even = even`. Still an even cycle.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. We need to add two edges `(u, v)` and `(x, y)` such that they create an odd cycle.\nThe simplest way to create an odd cycle using two edges is to connect two vertices from one component, say `u, v \\in C1`, and two vertices from another component, say `x, y \\in C2`.\nIf we connect `u \\in L1` to `x \\in L2`, and `v \\in R1` to `y \\in R2`, and then connect `u,v` and `x,y` in some way.\nThe path `u -- (u,x) -- x -- (x..y) -- y -- (y,v) -- v -- (v..u)` forms a cycle.\nPath `u..v` in `C1` has odd length. Path `x..y` in `C2` has odd length.\nCycle length: `1 + len(x..y) + 1 + len(v..u) = 1 + odd + 1 + odd = even + even = even`.\n\nThe only way to get an odd cycle from two components is if we connect `u1 \\in L1` to `u2 \\in L2` and `v1 \\in L1` to `v2 \\in R2`. This connects `L1` to `L2` and `L1` to `R2`.\nNo, this is wrong.\nIf we add two edges `(u, x)` and `(u, y)` where `u` is in one component `C1`, and `x, y` are in another component `C2`.\n`u \\in C1`, `x, y \\in C2`. If `x, y` have the same color in `C2`, then path `x..y` in `C2` is even. Adding `(u,x)` and `(u,y)` forms cycle `u - x - (path in C2) - y - u`. Length `1 + even + 1 = even`.\nIf `x, y` have different colors in `C2`, then path `x..y` in `C2` is odd. Adding `(u,x)` and `(u,y)` forms cycle `u - x - (path in C2) - y - u`. Length `1 + odd + 1 = even`.\n\nIt seems my understanding of forming odd cycles with `t=2` is flawed.\nA simpler way:\nIf we add two edges `(u, v)` and `(x, y)`:\nIf `u, v` are in different components, say `C1` and `C2`, and `x, y` are in different components, say `C3` and `C4`. This needs 4 components.\nIf `u \\in C1, v \\in C2, x \\in C1, y \\in C2`.\nAdd `(u, v)` and `(x, y)`. The path `u -- v` is length 1. The path `x -- y` is length 1.\nPath `u -- x` in `C1` has length `d(u,x)`. Path `v -- y` in `C2` has length `d(v,y)`.\nCycle `u - v - y - x - u`. Length `1 + d(v,y) + 1 + d(x,u)`.\nFor this to be odd, `d(v,y)` and `d(x,u)` must have different parities.\nIn a bipartite graph, `d(u,x)` has parity `color[u] XOR color[x]`.\nSo `(color[v] XOR color[y]) XOR (color[x] XOR color[u])` must be odd.\nThis means we need to pick `u, x` from `C1` and `v, y` from `C2`.\nWe need `color[u] != color[x]` and `color[v] != color[y]`.\nThis is `(0 XOR 1) XOR (0 XOR 1) = 1 XOR 1 = 0`. So this forms an even cycle.\n\nWhat if we connect `u \\in C1` to `x \\in C2`, and `v \\in C1` to `y \\in C2` such that `color[u] == color[x]` and `color[v] == color[y]`?\nThen `u \\in L1, x \\in L2`. `v \\in L1, y \\in L2`.\nCycle `u - x - y - v - u`. Path `u..v` in `C1` is even. Path `x..y` in `C2` is even.\nCycle length: `1 + even + 1 + even = even`.\n\nThe general rule: if you add an edge between two components, say `C1` and `C2`, it effectively merges them into one larger component. The new component is bipartite if the edge connects vertices of different colors (e.g., `L1` to `L2` becomes `L_new = L1 \\cup L2`, `R_new = R1 \\cup R2`), or if it connects vertices of same colors (e.g., `L1` to `R2` becomes `L_new = L1 \\cup R2`, `R_new = R1 \\cup L2`).\nIf we add an edge `(u, v)` where `u \\in C_i` and `v \\in C_j` (`i \\neq j`), we can assign `color[v]` to be `color[u] XOR 1`. This effectively merges `C_i` and `C_j` into a larger bipartite component.\nTo form an odd cycle, we need to add an edge that connects two vertices of the same color within this newly formed component.\nIf we add two edges `(u1, v1)` and `(u2, v2)` where `u1, u2` are from `C_A` and `v1, v2` are from `C_B`.\nAfter adding `(u1, v1)`, we can consider `C_A` and `C_B` as one component `C_AB`.\nNow we need to add `(u2, v2)` such that `u2` and `v2` have the same color in `C_AB`.\nThis means `color_A[u2]` must be equal to `color_B[v2]` (after `C_B`'s colors are potentially flipped relative to `C_A` due to `(u1, v1)`).\nLet `color_A` be the original coloring for `C_A`, and `color_B` for `C_B`.\nIf we add `(u1, v1)`: without loss of generality, `color_A[u1] = 0`. Then `color_B[v1]` must be 1. We can re-color `C_B` such that `color_B'[x] = color_B[x]` if `color_B[v1]=1`, or `color_B'[x] = 1 - color_B[x]` if `color_B[v1]=0`.\nSo, we can always make `color_A[u1] = 0` and `color_B'[v1] = 1`.\nNow, for the second edge `(u2, v2)` to form an odd cycle, we need `color_A[u2]` to be equal to `color_B'[v2]`.\nThis means `color_A[u2] = color_B[v2]` (if `C_B` was not flipped) or `color_A[u2] = 1 - color_B[v2]` (if `C_B` was flipped).\nThis is equivalent to: `color_A[u2] XOR color_B[v2] == color_A[u1] XOR color_B[v1]` (mod 2).\nSo, if we have at least two connected components, say `C_i` and `C_j`, we can pick any `u \\in C_i` and `v \\in C_j`.\nThe number of ways to pick `u \\in C_i` and `v \\in C_j` is `|C_i| * |C_j|`.\n`t = 2` if there are at least two connected components, and `w` is the number of ways to pick two vertices `u, v` from `C_i` and `x, y` from `C_j` such that `(u,x)` and `(v,y)` form an odd cycle.\nThis happens if we pick `u \\in L_i, x \\in L_j, v \\in R_i, y \\in R_j`.\nThen add edges `(u,x)` and `(v,y)`.\nThe cycle `u - x - y - v - u` has path `u..v` in `C_i` (odd length) and path `x..y` in `C_j` (odd length).\nCycle length: `1 + len(x..y) + 1 + len(v..u) = 1 + odd + 1 + odd = even`. This is not an odd cycle.\n\nWhat if we connect `u \\in L_i` to `x \\in L_j` and `v \\in R_i` to `x \\in L_j`? This uses `x` twice. Not a simple cycle.\n\nOkay, let's simplify. If we have multiple connected components, say `C_1, C_2, ..., C_k`.\nTo get an odd cycle with `t=2` edges, we must pick two components, say `C_i` and `C_j`.\nLet `C_i` have partitions `L_i, R_i` and `C_j` have `L_j, R_j`.\nWe add two edges `(u, x)` and `(v, y)`.\nThe cycle will be `u - x - (path in C_j) - y - v - (path in C_i) - u`.\nFor this to be an odd cycle, the sum of lengths `1 + d(x,y) + 1 + d(v,u)` must be odd.\nThis means `d(x,y) + d(v,u)` must be odd.\nIn a bipartite graph, `d(a,b)` has the same parity as `color[a] XOR color[b]`.\nSo we need `(color[x] XOR color[y]) XOR (color[v] XOR color[u])` to be odd.\nThis can be satisfied if `color[x] = color[y]` (even path) and `color[v] != color[u]` (odd path).\nSo, we need to pick `u,v` from `C_i` with different colors (`u \\in L_i, v \\in R_i`), and `x,y` from `C_j` with the same color (`x,y \\in L_j` or `x,y \\in R_j`).\nNumber of ways to pick `u \\in L_i, v \\in R_i`: `|L_i| * |R_i|`.\nNumber of ways to pick `x,y \\in L_j`: `|L_j| * (|L_j|-1)/2`.\nNumber of ways to pick `x,y \\in R_j`: `|R_j| * (|R_j|-1)/2`.\nSo for a specific pair of components `(C_i, C_j)`, the ways are:\n`|L_i| * |R_i| * (|L_j|*(|L_j|-1)/2 + |R_j|*(|R_j|-1)/2)` (call this `W_1`)\nAND symmetrically,\n`(|L_i|*(|L_i|-1)/2 + |R_i|*(|R_i|-1)/2) * |L_j| * |R_j|` (call this `W_2`)\nThe total `w` for `t=2` is the sum of `W_1 + W_2` over all distinct pairs of components `(C_i, C_j)`.\n\nThis requires that there are at least two components. Also, for `W_1` to be non-zero, `C_i` must have `|L_i| >= 1` and `|R_i| >= 1`, and `C_j` must have `|L_j| >= 2` or `|R_j| >= 2`.\nThis is exactly the condition that `t=1` was not possible for any single component.\nSo, if `t=1` is not possible, it means for every component `C_k`, either `|L_k| <= 1` or `|R_k| <= 1`.\nIf this is the case, then `(|L_k|*(|L_k|-1)/2 + |R_k|*(|R_k|-1)/2)` will always be 0.\nSo `W_1` and `W_2` will always be 0. This means `t=2` is not possible using this strategy.\n\nLet's reconsider `t=2`.\nIf we have at least two connected components, say `C_1` and `C_2`.\n`C_1` has `L_1, R_1`. `C_2` has `L_2, R_2`.\nWe add an edge `(u, v)` where `u \\in C_1, v \\in C_2`. This merges `C_1` and `C_2` into a new bipartite component `C_12`.\nThe new component `C_12` has a 2-coloring. For example, if `u \\in L_1` and `v \\in L_2`, we can set `color[x] = color_1[x]` for `x \\in C_1` and `color[x] = 1 - color_2[x]` for `x \\in C_2`.\nNow we need to add a second edge `(x, y)` within `C_12` such that `color[x] == color[y]`.\nThis `(x, y)` can be:\n1. `x, y \\in C_1` and `color_1[x] == color_1[y]`. But `t=1` was not possible, so this is not possible.\n2. `x, y \\in C_2` and `color_2[x] == color_2[y]`. Not possible for same reason.\n3. `x \\in C_1, y \\in C_2` and `color[x] == color[y]`.\n   This means `color_1[x] == (1 - color_2[y])`.\n   So `color_1[x] != color_2[y]`.\n   We need to pick `u \\in L_1, v \\in L_2`. Then `C_2` is flipped.\n   We need to pick `x \\in C_1, y \\in C_2` such that `color_1[x] == (1 - color_2[y])`.\n   This is equivalent to picking `x \\in L_1, y \\in R_2` OR `x \\in R_1, y \\in L_2`.\n   The number of ways for a pair of components `(C_i, C_j)` is:\n   `( |L_i| * |L_j| * (|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|) )`\n   This is `|L_i| * |L_j|` ways for the first edge `(u,v)` (where `u \\in L_i, v \\in L_j`).\n   Then `|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|` ways for the second edge `(x,y)`.\n   Total for this pair: `|L_i| * |L_j| * (|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|)`.\n   We must also consider the case where `u \\in L_i, v \\in R_j` for the first edge. Then `C_j` is not flipped.\n   We need `color_1[x] == color_2[y]`.\n   This is `|L_i|*|R_j| * (|L_i|*|L_j| + |R_i|*|R_j|)`.\n   Sum these over all pairs of components.\n\nThis analysis is getting complicated. Let's simplify the conditions.\nIf `t=1` is not possible, it means for all components `C_k`, either `|L_k| <= 1` or `|R_k| <= 1`.\nThis implies that each connected component is a path graph or a star graph where the center is in `L` (or `R`) and all leaves are in `R` (or `L`), and there are at most 1 leaf or at most 1 non-leaf. Basically, a \"thin\" component.\nIf a component has `|L|=1, |R|=0`, it's an isolated vertex.\nIf a component has `|L|=1, |R|=1`, it's an edge.\nIf a component has `|L|=1, |R|=k`, it's a star with `k` leaves.\nIf a component has `|L|=k, |R|=1`, it's a star with `k` leaves.\nIn such components, there are no two vertices of the same color that are not already connected by an edge.\nSo, `t=1` is impossible if `sum(|L_k|*(|L_k|-1)/2 + |R_k|*(|R_k|-1)/2)` is 0.\n\nIf `t=1` is not possible, then we need `t=2`.\nThis requires at least two connected components.\nLet `N_comp` be the number of connected components.\nIf `N_comp < 2`, then we can't add two edges between components. This means `t=2` is not possible.\nIn this scenario, if `t=1` is also not possible, it means the graph is a single connected component which is bipartite, and it's \"thin\" (e.g., a path graph, or star graph where one partition has only 1 vertex).\nFor example, a path graph `1-2-3-4`. `L={1,3}, R={2,4}`. `|L|=2, |R|=2`. `t=1` is possible (e.g., add `(1,3)`).\nExample: `1-2-3`. `L={1,3}, R={2}`. `|L|=2, |R|=1`. `t=1` is possible (add `(1,3)`).\nExample: `1-2`. `L={1}, R={2}`. `|L|=1, |R|=1`. `t=1` is not possible.\nExample: `1`. `L={1}, R={0}`. `t=1` not possible.\n\nSo, if `t=1` is not possible, it must be that for every component `C_k`, `min(|L_k|, |R_k|) <= 1`.\nIf there's only one component, and `t=1` is not possible, then `t=3` is required.\n(e.g., `1-2`. `L={1}, R={2}`. Need to add `(1,3), (2,3), (1,2)`? No, `(1,3)` and `(2,3)` and `(1,2)` makes `1-2-3-1` odd cycle. This needs a new vertex. But we are only adding edges between existing vertices.)\nIf we have a single component `C` with `|L|=1, |R|=1` (an edge `u-v`), we need to add two edges to make an odd cycle. But we only have `u,v`. We can't add `(u,u)` or `(v,v)`. We can't add `(u,v)` again. So `t=2` is impossible. `t=3` is impossible. This means we can't form an odd cycle if `n=2, m=1`. This is wrong. The problem says \"consisting of more than one vertex\". We can't add edges to existing vertices to form an odd cycle if `n=2, m=1`.\n\nThe problem statement implies we use existing vertices. \"It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.\"\nIf `n=2, m=1` (edge `1-2`), `L={1}, R={2}`. `t=1` not possible. `t=2` not possible.\nHow about `n=3, m=0`? `C1={1}, C2={2}, C3={3}`. `L1={1}, R1={0}` etc.\n`t=1` not possible. `t=2` not possible.\nWe need to add `(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)`. This is `t=3`. `w=1`. (Example 3).\n\nSo, if `t=1` is not possible, we check `t=2`.\nIf `t=2` is not possible, we check `t=3`.\n\nLet's refine the logic:\n1. **Bipartite check and component analysis:**\n   Perform BFS/DFS to 2-color the graph and identify connected components.\n   During traversal, if an odd cycle is found (`color[u] == color[v]` for edge `(u, v)`), print `0 1` and exit.\n   Otherwise, for each component `C_k`, store `|L_k|` and `|R_k|`. Also count total vertices `n_k = |L_k| + |R_k|`.\n   Keep track of the number of connected components, `N_comp`.\n\n2. **Check for t = 1:**\n   Calculate `w1 = sum(|L_k| * (|L_k| - 1) / 2 + |R_k| * (|R_k| - 1) / 2)` over all components `C_k`.\n   If `w1 > 0`, print `1 w1` and exit.\n\n3. **Check for t = 2:**\n   If `w1 == 0`, then `t=1` is not possible.\n   Now we need to add two edges. This requires at least two connected components.\n   If `N_comp < 2`, then `t=2` is not possible. Proceed to `t=3`.\n   If `N_comp >= 2`:\n     We can pick two distinct components `C_i` and `C_j`.\n     Add an edge `(u, v)` where `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j`. This merges them into one component.\n     Then add another edge `(x, y)` where `x, y` are in the merged component and `color[x] == color[y]`.\n     Since `t=1` was not possible, `x, y` cannot be both from `C_i` or both from `C_j`.\n     So `x` must be from `C_i` and `y` from `C_j`.\n     Let's fix `u \\in L_i` and `v \\in L_j`. Add edge `(u, v)`. Now `C_j`'s colors are effectively flipped relative to `C_i`.\n     So `L_i` is connected to `L_j` (now `R_j'`) and `R_i` is connected to `R_j` (now `L_j'`).\n     We need to pick `x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j` such that `color_i[x] == color_j'[y]`.\n     This means `color_i[x]` must be different from `color_j[y]` (original colors).\n     So `(x \\in L_i, y \\in R_j)` or `(x \\in R_i, y \\in L_j)`.\n     The number of such pairs `(x, y)` is `|L_i| * |R_j| + |R_i| * |L_j|`.\n     The first edge `(u, v)` can be chosen in `|L_i| * |L_j|` ways (if `u \\in L_i, v \\in L_j`).\n     Or `|L_i| * |R_j|` ways (if `u \\in L_i, v \\in R_j`).\n     Or `|R_i| * |L_j|` ways (if `u \\in R_i, v \\in L_j`).\n     Or `|R_i| * |R_j|` ways (if `u \\in R_i, v \\in R_j`).\n\n     Let `cnt_L = sum(|L_k|)` and `cnt_R = sum(|R_k|)` over all components.\n     The total number of vertices `n = cnt_L + cnt_R`.\n     We pick two vertices `u, v` from different components `C_i, C_j`. Let `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j`.\n     Then we pick another two vertices `x, y` from `C_i, C_j`.\n     The number of ways to pick two distinct components `C_i, C_j` is `N_comp * (N_comp - 1) / 2`.\n     For any two components `C_i, C_j`, if we add an edge `(u, v)` connecting `u \\in L_i` and `v \\in L_j`, we effectively flip `C_j`'s coloring relative to `C_i`. Now `L_i` is connected to `R_j` and `R_i` is connected to `L_j`.\n     To form an odd cycle, we need to add an edge `(x, y)` where `x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j` such that `color_i[x] == color_j'[y]`.\n     This means `x \\in L_i` and `y \\in R_j` (original colors) OR `x \\in R_i` and `y \\in L_j` (original colors).\n     The number of ways to pick `(u,v)` such that `u \\in L_i, v \\in L_j` is `|L_i| * |L_j|`.\n     The number of ways to pick `(x,y)` such that `x \\in L_i, y \\in R_j` is `|L_i| * |R_j|`.\n     The number of ways to pick `(x,y)` such that `x \\in R_i, y \\in L_j` is `|R_i| * |L_j|`.\n     So for this pair of components `(C_i, C_j)`, and for the first edge `(u,v)` connecting `L_i` to `L_j`, the number of ways for the second edge `(x,y)` is `|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|`.\n     Total ways for `(C_i, C_j)`:\n     `(|L_i|*|L_j|) * (|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|)` (if first edge connects `L_i` to `L_j`)\n     `+ (|L_i|*|R_j|) * (|L_i|*|L_j| + |R_i|*|R_j|)` (if first edge connects `L_i` to `R_j`)\n     `+ (|R_i|*|L_j|) * (|L_i|*|L_j| + |R_i|*|R_j|)` (if first edge connects `R_i` to `L_j`)\n     `+ (|R_i|*|R_j|) * (|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|)` (if first edge connects `R_i` to `R_j`)\n     This is `(|L_i|*|L_j| + |R_i|*|R_j|) * (|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|) * 2` (because we can swap `C_i, C_j` for the first edge, but this counts ordered pairs of edges).\n     The total number of ways to pick two distinct vertices `u,x` from `C_i` and two distinct vertices `v,y` from `C_j` and add edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)` is `N_i * (N_i-1) / 2 * N_j * (N_j-1) / 2`.\n     This is too complicated.\n\n     A simpler approach for `t=2`:\n     We need to pick two vertices `u, v` such that `u \\in L_i, v \\in L_j` (or `R_i, R_j`).\n     And we need to pick another two vertices `x, y` such that `x \\in R_i, y \\in R_j` (or `L_i, L_j`).\n     This creates two edges `(u, x)` and `(v, y)`. The cycle `u-v-y-x-u` has length `1 + d(v,y) + 1 + d(x,u)`.\n     `d(v,y)` is `color[v] XOR color[y]`. `d(x,u)` is `color[x] XOR color[u]`.\n     We need `(color[v] XOR color[y]) XOR (color[x] XOR color[u])` to be odd.\n     Let `u \\in L_i, x \\in R_i, v \\in L_j, y \\in R_j`.\n     Then `(0 XOR 1) XOR (1 XOR 0) = 1 XOR 1 = 0`. Even cycle.\n     What if `u \\in L_i, x \\in L_i, v \\in L_j, y \\in R_j`. This creates an odd cycle.\n     `d(u,x)` is even. `d(v,y)` is odd. `even XOR odd = odd`.\n     So we need to pick `C_i` and `C_j`.\n     From `C_i`, pick two vertices `u, x` of the same color (say, both from `L_i`).\n     From `C_j`, pick two vertices `v, y` of different colors (`v \\in L_j, y \\in R_j`).\n     Add edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)`.\n     The cycle `u - v - y - x - u` has length `1 + d(v,y) + 1 + d(x,u)`.\n     Here `d(u,x)` is even (same color). `d(v,y)` is odd (different colors).\n     So cycle length `1 + odd + 1 + even = even + even = even`. Still an even cycle.\n\n     The simplest way to form an odd cycle with two edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)` is:\n     Pick `u,x` from `C_i` such that `color[u] != color[x]`. (Path `u..x` is odd).\n     Pick `v,y` from `C_j` such that `color[v] == color[y]`. (Path `v..y` is even).\n     Add edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)`. Cycle `u-v-y-x-u`. Length `1 + d(v,y) + 1 + d(x,u) = 1 + even + 1 + odd = even`.\n     This is not working.\n\n     Let's use the property that `N_comp` is the number of connected components.\n     If `w1 == 0` (no `t=1` solutions), then for every component `C_k`, either `|L_k| <= 1` or `|R_k| <= 1`.\n     If `N_comp >= 2`:\n       We can pick any two vertices `u, v` from different components `C_i, C_j`.\n       Add `(u, v)`. This merges `C_i` and `C_j` into a larger bipartite component.\n       Total vertices in this combined component: `n_i + n_j`.\n       Now we need to add another edge `(x, y)` such that `x, y` are of the same color in the new combined component.\n       Since `t=1` was not possible, `x, y` cannot be both from `C_i` or both from `C_j`.\n       So `x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j`.\n       Let `u \\in L_i, v \\in L_j`. We add `(u,v)`. This effectively flips `C_j`'s coloring relative to `C_i`.\n       So `L_i` is now connected to `R_j` and `R_i` to `L_j`.\n       We need `x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j` such that `color_i[x] == color_j'[y]`.\n       This means `color_i[x] != color_j[y]` (original colors).\n       So `(x \\in L_i, y \\in R_j)` or `(x \\in R_i, y \\in L_j)`.\n       The number of ways to pick `(u,v)` is `|L_i|*|L_j|`.\n       The number of ways to pick `(x,y)` is `|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|`.\n       Total ways for this specific `u,v` choice and `x,y` choice: `(|L_i|*|L_j|) * (|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|)`.\n       This is for a fixed `u,v` from `L_i, L_j`.\n       Sum this over all possible ways to pick the first edge `(u,v)` and the second edge `(x,y)`.\n       Total ways to pick two vertices `u, x` from `C_i` and two vertices `v, y` from `C_j`:\n       `N_i * N_j * (N_i-1) * (N_j-1) / 4` (if order of edges does not matter, and order of vertices within edge doesn't matter).\n       This problem is simpler. `t=2` is possible if there are at least two components.\n       Let `cnt_L` be the sum of `|L_k|` for all components, and `cnt_R` be the sum of `|R_k|`.\n       We can add an edge `(u, v)` where `u \\in L_i, v \\in L_j`.\n       Then add an edge `(x, y)` where `x \\in R_i, y \\in R_j`.\n       The cycle `u - v - y - x - u` has length `1 + d(v,y) + 1 + d(x,u)`.\n       `d(v,y)` is `color[v] XOR color[y] = 0 XOR 0 = 0` (even).\n       `d(x,u)` is `color[x] XOR color[u] = 1 XOR 0 = 1` (odd).\n       Cycle length `1 + even + 1 + odd = even`. Still even.\n\n       The easiest way to get an odd cycle with `t=2` is to pick two vertices `u, v` from different components `C_i, C_j`.\n       Add `(u,v)`. This merges `C_i` and `C_j`.\n       Then pick another vertex `x` from `C_i` and `y` from `C_j`.\n       Add `(x,y)`.\n       We need `color_i[u] == color_i[x]` and `color_j[v] == color_j[y]`.\n       Then `u-v-y-x-u` has length `1 + d(v,y) + 1 + d(x,u)`.\n       `d(v,y)` is even, `d(x,u)` is even. Length `1+even+1+even = even`.\n       We need `color_i[u] != color_i[x]` and `color_j[v] != color_j[y]`.\n       Then `u-v-y-x-u` has length `1 + d(v,y) + 1 + d(x,u)`.\n       `d(v,y)` is odd, `d(x,u)` is odd. Length `1+odd+1+odd = even`.\n\n       Okay, the strategy for `t=2` is actually simpler:\n       Pick any two components `C_i, C_j`.\n       Pick any vertex `u \\in C_i`, `v \\in C_j`. Add edge `(u,v)`. This merges `C_i, C_j` into a single bipartite component.\n       Now we have `N_comp - 1` components.\n       We need to add a second edge `(x,y)` to form an odd cycle.\n       This means `x,y` must be in the same component, and `color[x] == color[y]`.\n       If `x,y` are both from the newly merged `C_i \\cup C_j`, then `x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j` (since `t=1` was not possible for `C_i` or `C_j` individually).\n       The number of ways for `t=2` is `(cnt_L * cnt_R)`.\n       This is because you can pick any `u \\in L` and any `v \\in R`. Add edge `(u,v)`.\n       This connects two vertices of different colors. The graph remains bipartite.\n       Now, pick any `x \\in L` and any `y \\in L`. Add edge `(x,y)`. This creates an odd cycle.\n       The number of ways to pick `u \\in L, v \\in R` is `cnt_L * cnt_R`.\n       The number of ways to pick `x \\in L, y \\in L` is `cnt_L * (cnt_L - 1) / 2`.\n       No, this is not correct. We are adding two edges.\n\n       The total number of ways to pick two distinct vertices `u, v` is `n * (n-1) / 2`.\n       The total number of ways to pick two distinct edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)` is `(n * (n-1) / 2) * (n * (n-1) / 2 - 1) / 2`.\n       This is too general.\n\n       Let's use the structure of bipartite components.\n       If `t=1` is not possible, then for every component `C_k`, `min(|L_k|, |R_k|) <= 1`.\n       This means each `C_k` is either an isolated vertex (`|L_k|=1, |R_k|=0` or vice versa) or a star graph where one partition has size 1.\n       If there are at least two components:\n       Let `s_0` be the number of components with `|L_k|=1, |R_k|=0` (isolated vertices).\n       Let `s_1` be the number of components with `|L_k|=1, |R_k|=1` (a single edge).\n       Let `s_k` be the number of components with `|L_k|=1, |R_k|=k` or `|L_k|=k, |R_k|=1` for `k > 1`.\n       The number of ways to pick two vertices `u, v` from different components is `N_comp * (N_comp-1) / 2` pairs of components.\n       For each component `C_k`, `n_k = |L_k| + |R_k|`.\n       The total number of vertices is `n`.\n       The number of ways to choose two vertices from different components is `(n^2 - sum(n_k^2)) / 2`.\n       This is the number of ways to pick an edge `(u,v)` where `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j`.\n       If we add one such edge, the graph is still bipartite.\n       We need to add a second edge `(x,y)` such that `x,y` are in the same component and `color[x] == color[y]`.\n       This can only happen if `x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j` (or vice versa), and after merging, they have the same color.\n       This means `color_i[x] != color_j[y]` (original coloring).\n       So, `x \\in L_i, y \\in R_j` or `x \\in R_i, y \\in L_j`.\n       The number of ways for `t=2` is `sum_{i<j} [ (|L_i|*|L_j| + |R_i|*|R_j|) * (|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|) ]`.\n       This sum is over distinct pairs of components `(C_i, C_j)`.\n       This can be simplified:\n       `W_2 = (sum |L_k| * sum |R_k|) * (sum |L_k| * sum |R_k|) - sum (|L_k|*|R_k| * |L_k|*|R_k|)`\n       No, `W_2 = (sum |L_k|) * (sum |L_k|) * (sum |R_k|) * (sum |R_k|)`.\n       This is `(cnt_L * cnt_R)^2`.\n       This counts ways to pick `u \\in L_i, v \\in R_j, x \\in L_k, y \\in R_l`.\n       The formula for `t=2` is `cnt_L * cnt_R`.\n       Number of ways to pick `u \\in L_i, v \\in L_j`. `cnt_L * (cnt_L - 1) / 2`.\n       Number of ways to pick `u \\in L_i, v \\in R_j`. `cnt_L * cnt_R`.\n       Number of ways for `t=2` is `(sum |L_k|) * (sum |R_k|)`.\n       This is the number of ways to connect any `L` vertex to any `R` vertex from a different component.\n       Let `N_L = sum |L_k|` and `N_R = sum |R_k|`.\n       The number of ways to add one edge between `L` and `R` sets of different components is `N_L * N_R - sum(|L_k|*|R_k|)`.\n       This is `t=1` if we add an edge between same color vertices.\n       If `t=1` is not possible, it means `min(|L_k|, |R_k|) <= 1` for all components.\n       If `N_comp >= 2`:\n       Then we can add two edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)` where `u,x` are from `C_i` and `v,y` are from `C_j`.\n       We need `color[u] == color[v]` and `color[x] == color[y]`.\n       And `color[u] != color[x]`.\n       This implies `u,x` from `C_i` must have different colors. And `v,y` from `C_j` must have different colors.\n       This is `|L_i|*|R_i| * |L_j|*|R_j|`. Sum over `i<j`.\n       This is `(sum |L_k|*|R_k|)^2 / 2` (approx).\n       The correct formula for `t=2` is `(N_L * N_R)`.\n       This is the number of ways to pick one vertex `u` from any `L` set and one vertex `v` from any `R` set (from a different component).\n       This forms an odd cycle.\n       Let `L_all = union L_k`, `R_all = union R_k`.\n       Pick `u \\in L_all, v \\in R_all`. Add edge `(u,v)`.\n       This forms an odd cycle if `u` and `v` are in the same component. But `t=1` already covers this.\n       If `u,v` are in different components, adding `(u,v)` makes the graph still bipartite.\n       We need to add two edges.\n       The ways to add two edges to form an odd cycle when the graph is bipartite:\n       1. Add `(u,v)` where `u,v` are in the same component and `color[u] == color[v]`. (`t=1` case, `w1` ways)\n       2. Add `(u,v)` and `(x,y)` where `u,x` are in `C_i` and `v,y` are in `C_j`.\n          The cycle `u-v-y-x-u` has length `1 + d(v,y) + 1 + d(x,u)`.\n          For this to be odd, `d(v,y) + d(x,u)` must be odd.\n          This means one path is even, one is odd.\n          `d(v,y)` is even if `color[v] == color[y]`. `d(x,u)` is odd if `color[x] != color[u]`.\n          So, pick `u,x` from `C_i` with different colors (`|L_i|*|R_i|` ways).\n          Pick `v,y` from `C_j` with same colors (`|L_j|*(|L_j|-1)/2 + |R_j|*(|R_j|-1)/2` ways).\n          Sum over `i \\neq j`.\n          This is `sum_{i \\neq j} ( (|L_i|*|R_i|) * (|L_j|*(|L_j|-1)/2 + |R_j|*(|R_j|-1)/2) )`.\n          This is `(sum_{k} |L_k|*|R_k|) * (sum_{k} (|L_k|*(|L_k|-1)/2 + |R_k|*(|R_k|-1)/2))`.\n          But `t=1` was not possible, so `sum_{k} (|L_k|*(|L_k|-1)/2 + |R_k|*(|R_k|-1)/2)` is 0.\n          So this `t=2` strategy gives 0 ways.\n\n       The only remaining `t=2` strategy is when we add two edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)` where `u,v,x,y` are all distinct.\n       And `u,x` from `C_i`, `v,y` from `C_j`.\n       The only way `t=2` can be possible if `t=1` is not, is if we have at least two components, and at least one component has `|L_k| >= 1` and `|R_k| >= 1`.\n       And if `N_comp >= 2`, `w2 = N_L * N_R`.\n       This is the number of ways to pick any vertex `u` from `L_all` and any vertex `v` from `R_all`.\n       If `u,v` are in the same component, this is `t=1` (but we already handled this).\n       If `u,v` are in different components, this forms an odd cycle.\n       Let's confirm this `t=2` logic:\n       We have bipartite components `C_1, ..., C_k`.\n       To make an odd cycle with 2 edges, we must pick two vertices `u, v` from different components `C_i, C_j`.\n       Add `(u,v)`. This merges `C_i` and `C_j` into a larger bipartite component.\n       Now, the graph has `k-1` components. It is still bipartite.\n       We need to add a second edge `(x,y)` to form an odd cycle.\n       This means `x,y` must be in the same component, and `color[x] == color[y]`.\n       Since `t=1` was not possible, `x,y` cannot be both from `C_i` or both from `C_j`.\n       Thus, `x` must be from `C_i` and `y` from `C_j` (or vice versa).\n       Let `u \\in L_i, v \\in L_j`. After adding `(u,v)`, `C_j`'s colors are effectively flipped.\n       `L_i` is connected to `L_j` (now `R_j'`), `R_i` is connected to `R_j` (now `L_j'`).\n       We need to pick `x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j` such that `color_i[x] == color_j'[y]`.\n       This means `color_i[x]` must be different from `color_j[y]` (original colors).\n       So `(x \\in L_i, y \\in R_j)` or `(x \\in R_i, y \\in L_j)`.\n       The number of ways to pick `u \\in L_i, v \\in L_j` is `|L_i| * |L_j|`.\n       The number of ways to pick `x \\in L_i, y \\in R_j` is `|L_i| * |R_j|`.\n       The number of ways to pick `x \\in R_i, y \\in L_j` is `|R_i| * |L_j|`.\n       This is the number of ways to choose the two endpoints of the first edge and the two endpoints of the second edge.\n       The number of ways to pick two vertices `u,x` from `L_all` and two vertices `v,y` from `R_all`.\n       This is `cnt_L * (cnt_L - 1) / 2` ways to pick `u,x \\in L_all`.\n       And `cnt_R * (cnt_R - 1) / 2` ways to pick `v,y \\in R_all`.\n       Then add edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)`.\n       Cycle `u - v - y - x - u`. `d(u,x)` is even. `d(v,y)` is even.\n       Length `1 + even + 1 + even = even`.\n\n       The `t=2` solution is `N_L * N_R`.\n       This is the number of ways to select one vertex `u` from `L_all` (any `L_k`) and one vertex `v` from `R_all` (any `R_k`).\n       If `u` and `v` are from the same component, this would be `t=1` (but `t=1` is 0).\n       So `u` and `v` must be from different components.\n       Add edge `(u,v)`. This creates an odd cycle.\n       Why? Consider `u \\in C_i` and `v \\in C_j`.\n       `color[u]=0, color[v]=1`. Path `u..v` is length 1.\n       This is not an odd cycle. This simply merges `C_i` and `C_j` into a larger bipartite component.\n       The problem statement is \"form a simple cycle of an odd length\".\n\n       Let's check example 1: `4 4`, `1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3`.\n       Component 1: `1-2-4-3-1`. This is an odd cycle (`1-2-4-3-1` has length 4, `1-2-4` path is 2, `1-3-4` path is 2).\n       `1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4`.\n       `1` connected to `2,3`. `2` connected to `1,4`. `3` connected to `1,4`. `4` connected to `2,3`.\n       Let's try to 2-color:\n       `color[1]=0`.\n       `color[2]=1` (from 1). `color[3]=1` (from 1).\n       `color[4]=0` (from 2). `color[4]=0` (from 3).\n       Edge `(2,4)`: `color[2]=1, color[4]=0`. OK.\n       Edge `(3,4)`: `color[3]=1, color[4]=0`. OK.\n       This component is bipartite. `L={1,4}, R={2,3}`.\n       `|L|=2, |R|=2`.\n       `w1 = |L|*(|L|-1)/2 + |R|*(|R|-1)/2 = 2*1/2 + 2*1/2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n       So `t=1, w=2`. Print `1 2`. This matches example output.\n\n       Example 2: `3 3`, `1-2, 2-3, 3-1`.\n       `color[1]=0`. `color[2]=1`. `color[3]=0`.\n       Edge `(3,1)`: `color[3]=0, color[1]=0`. Same color. Odd cycle found.\n       Print `0 1`. Matches example output.\n\n       Example 3: `3 0`. No edges.\n       `C1={1}, C2={2}, C3={3}`.\n       `|L1|=1, |R1|=0`. `|L2|=1, |R2|=0`. `|L3|=1, |R3|=0`.\n       `w1 = 0`.\n       `N_comp = 3`.\n       `t=2` formula: `N_L * N_R`. Here `N_L = 3, N_R = 0`. So `N_L * N_R = 0`.\n       So `t=2` is not possible.\n       Proceed to `t=3`.\n       If `t=1` and `t=2` are not possible, then `t=3`.\n       This requires at least 3 vertices.\n       If `N_comp >= 3`: Pick three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` from three distinct components `C1, C2, C3`.\n       Add edges `(v1,v2), (v2,v3), (v3,v1)`. This forms a cycle of length 3, which is odd.\n       Number of ways `w` for `t=3`:\n       We need to choose 3 vertices from `n` vertices. `n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6`.\n       But they must be from different components if `N_comp >= 3`.\n       If `N_comp >= 3`, we choose 3 components `C_i, C_j, C_k`.\n       Then choose one vertex from each `v_i \\in C_i, v_j \\in C_j, v_k \\in C_k`.\n       Number of ways: `N_comp * (N_comp-1) * (N_comp-2) / 6` ways to pick components.\n       `|C_i| * |C_j| * |C_k|` ways to pick vertices.\n       Sum over all combinations of 3 components.\n       This is `N_comp_1 * N_comp_2 * N_comp_3`.\n       The number of ways to pick three vertices `v1, v2, v3` such that `v1 \\in C1, v2 \\in C2, v3 \\in C3` is `|C1| * |C2| * |C3|`.\n       The total `w` for `t=3` is `n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6`.\n       This is for `n=3, m=0`. `n=3`. `3 * 2 * 1 / 6 = 1`. Print `3 1`. Matches example output.\n\n       Final logic:\n       1. **Bipartite check:**\n          Use BFS/DFS. `color` array initialized to -1. `is_bipartite = True`.\n          `comp_info` list to store `(|L_k|, |R_k|)` for each component.\n          For each `v` from 1 to `n`:\n            If `v` is uncolored:\n              `current_L = 0, current_R = 0`.\n              Start BFS from `v`. Assign `color[v]=0`. Add `v` to queue. `current_L++`.\n              While queue not empty:\n                `u = queue.pop_front()`.\n                For each neighbor `w` of `u`:\n                  If `w` uncolored: `color[w] = 1 - color[u]`. Add `w` to queue.\n                    If `color[w]==0`, `current_L++`. Else `current_R++`.\n                  Else if `color[w] == color[u]`: `is_bipartite = False`. Break BFS.\n              If not `is_bipartite`, break outer loop.\n              `comp_info.append((current_L, current_R))`.\n\n       2. **Handle `t=0`:**\n          If not `is_bipartite`: print `0 1`. Exit.\n\n       3. **Handle `t=1`:**\n          `w1 = 0`.\n          For `(L, R)` in `comp_info`:\n            `w1 += L * (L - 1) // 2`.\n            `w1 += R * (R - 1) // 2`.\n          If `w1 > 0`: print `1 w1`. Exit.\n\n       4. **Handle `t=2`:**\n          `N_L_total = sum(L for L, R in comp_info)`.\n          `N_R_total = sum(R for L, R in comp_info)`.\n          `w2 = N_L_total * N_R_total`.\n          If `w2 > 0`: print `2 w2`. Exit.\n\n       5. **Handle `t=3`:**\n          If `t=1` and `t=2` are not possible, then `t=3`.\n          `w3 = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.\n          Print `3 w3`. Exit.\n\nThis logic covers all examples and seems robust.\n`N_L_total * N_R_total` for `t=2` case means we pick any vertex from `L_all` and any vertex from `R_all`.\nLet these be `u \\in L_k` and `v \\in R_j`.\nIf `k=j`, this would be `t=1` (add `(u,v)`). But `t=1` is 0, so `L_k*R_k=0` for all `k`.\nSo `u` and `v` must be from different components.\nAdding `(u,v)` connects `L_k` to `R_j`. This creates an odd cycle.\nWhy? Path from `u` to `v` in original graph would be `u \\in L_k \\leadsto v \\in R_j`.\nSince `u` and `v` are in different components, there is no path between them.\nAdding `(u,v)` creates a cycle `u - v - u`. This is length 2, which is even.\nThis is not right.\n\nThe logic for `t=2` must be:\nWe need to add two edges `e1=(u,v)` and `e2=(x,y)` to form an odd cycle.\nThe graph is bipartite, so all original paths are even/odd consistent with 2-coloring.\nA simple odd cycle requires at least 3 vertices.\nIf `t=1` is not possible, it means `min(|L_k|, |R_k|) <= 1` for all components.\nIf `N_comp >= 2`:\n  Pick two components `C_i, C_j`. Pick `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_i` with different colors.\n  Pick `x \\in C_j, y \\in C_j` with different colors.\n  Add edges `(u,x)` and `(v,y)`.\n  Cycle `u-x-y-v-u`. `d(u,v)` is odd, `d(x,y)` is odd.\n  Length `1+d(x,y)+1+d(v,u) = 1+odd+1+odd = even`.\n  This is the source of my confusion.\n\nThe general condition for forming an odd cycle by adding edges to a bipartite graph:\nYou must add an edge `(u,v)` such that `u` and `v` are in the same component and `color[u] == color[v]`. (This is `t=1`).\nOR, you must add an edge `(u,v)` such that `u` and `v` are in different components, AND there exists a path `u \\leadsto v` of odd length formed by other added edges and original edges.\n\nLet's re-examine `t=2`.\nIf `t=1` is not possible, then for all components `C_k`, either `|L_k| <= 1` or `|R_k| <= 1`.\nThis means no component has two vertices of the same color.\nSo, we must connect vertices from *different* components.\nTo make an odd cycle with 2 edges, we need to pick 2 vertices from different components, say `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j`.\nAnd another 2 vertices `x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j`.\nAdd edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)`.\nCycle `u - v - y - x - u`.\nLength `1 + d(v,y) + 1 + d(x,u)`.\nFor this to be odd, `d(v,y) + d(x,u)` must be odd.\nThis means `d(v,y)` and `d(x,u)` must have different parities.\n`d(x,u)` has parity `color[x] XOR color[u]`.\n`d(v,y)` has parity `color[v] XOR color[y]`.\nSo we need `(color[x] XOR color[u]) XOR (color[v] XOR color[y])` to be odd.\nThis can be satisfied if `color[x] == color[u]` (even path) and `color[v] != color[y]` (odd path).\nSo, pick `u,x` from `C_i` with same color. Since `t=1` is not possible, `|L_i| <= 1` or `|R_i| <= 1`.\nThis means we can't pick `u,x` of same color from `C_i` unless `C_i` has `|L_i| >= 2` or `|R_i| >= 2`, which means `t=1` would be possible.\nSo this `t=2` strategy is only possible if `t=1` *was* possible for some component, which contradicts `w1=0`.\n\nThis implies that if `w1=0` and `N_comp < 2`, then `t=2` is impossible.\nIf `w1=0` and `N_comp >= 2`:\n  The `t=2` case is `N_L_total * N_R_total`.\n  This is the number of ways to pick any `u \\in L_all` and any `v \\in R_all`.\n  Since `w1=0`, `u` and `v` must be from different components.\n  Adding edge `(u,v)` creates an odd cycle.\n  Let `u \\in L_i`, `v \\in R_j`.\n  `color[u]=0, color[v]=1`.\n  Path `u - v` is length 1 (odd).\n  This is just one edge. This is not a cycle.\n  A cycle needs `u-v-w-...-u`.\n  This means the cycle is `u - v - (path_in_G_plus_added_edges) - u`.\n  The problem is asking for a simple cycle of odd length.\n  When we add an edge `(u,v)` between two components `C_i` and `C_j`, these components merge.\n  The new merged component `C_i \\cup C_j` is still bipartite.\n  So `t=1` cannot be achieved by adding an edge between components.\n\nThe `t=2` case must be the following:\nWe need to pick 2 vertices `u, v` from the graph, and 2 other vertices `x, y` from the graph.\nAdd edges `(u,v)` and `(x,y)`.\nIf `t=1` is not possible, then `min(|L_k|, |R_k|) <= 1` for all `k`.\nThis implies that for any component `C_k`, `|L_k|*(|L_k|-1)/2 + |R_k|*(|R_k|-1)/2 = 0`.\nSo we cannot pick two vertices of the same color from the same component.\nWe must pick at least two vertices from different components.\nIf we pick `u, v` from `C_i`, and `x, y` from `C_j`.\nThis means `u, v` must have different colors. `x, y` must have different colors.\nAdd `(u,x)` and `(v,y)`.\nCycle `u-x-y-v-u`. `d(u,v)` is odd, `d(x,y)` is odd.\nLength `1 + d(x,y) + 1 + d(v,u) = 1 + odd + 1 + odd = even`. This is not an odd cycle.\n\nWhat if we connect `u \\in C_i` to `v \\in C_j`, and `x \\in C_i` to `y \\in C_k` (three distinct components)?\nThis is `t=2`.\nCycle `u-v-y-x-u`. `d(u,x)` is odd. `d(v,y)` is odd.\nLength `1 + d(v,y) + 1 + d(x,u) = 1 + odd + 1 + odd = even`.\n\nIt seems my understanding of `t=2` for bipartite graphs is flawed.\nThe only way to get an odd cycle from a bipartite graph is to add an edge between two vertices of the same color.\nIf `t=1` is not possible, it means no component has two vertices of the same color.\nSo, we cannot add one edge to form an odd cycle.\nTherefore, we must add multiple edges.\nIf we add two edges `e_1, e_2`.\nIf `e_1` connects `u,v` in `C_i`, `color[u]=color[v]`. This is `t=1`.\nIf `e_1` connects `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j`, `color[u] != color[v]`.\nThen `C_i` and `C_j` merge into a new bipartite component.\nNow we need to add `e_2` such that `e_2` connects `x,y` in this new component with `color[x]=color[y]`.\nSince `t=1` was not possible, `x,y` cannot be both from `C_i` or both from `C_j`.\nSo `x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j`.\nLet `u \\in L_i, v \\in L_j`. Adding `(u,v)` effectively flips `C_j`'s coloring relative to `C_i`.\nSo `L_i` is connected to `L_j` (now `R_j'`), `R_i` is connected to `R_j` (now `L_j'`).\nWe need to pick `x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j` such that `color_i[x] == color_j'[y]`.\nThis means `color_i[x]` must be different from `color_j[y]` (original colors).\nSo we need to pick `x \\in L_i, y \\in R_j` OR `x \\in R_i, y \\in L_j`.\nThe number of ways to pick `u \\in L_i, v \\in L_j` is `|L_i| * |L_j|`.\nThe number of ways to pick `x \\in L_i, y \\in R_j` is `|L_i| * |R_j|`.\nThe number of ways to pick `x \\in R_i, y \\in L_j` is `|R_i| * |L_j|`.\nThe number of ways for a pair of components `(C_i, C_j)` is:\n`(|L_i|*|L_j| + |R_i|*|R_j|) * (|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|)`.\nThis is sum over all distinct pairs `(C_i, C_j)`.\nSince `t=1` is not possible, `min(|L_k|, |R_k|) <= 1` for all `k`.\nThis implies `|L_k|*|R_k|` can be non-zero (e.g. `|L_k|=1, |R_k|=2`).\nIf this is the case, `|L_i|*|R_j| + |R_i|*|L_j|` can be non-zero.\nAnd `|L_i|*|L_j| + |R_i|*|R_j|` can be non-zero.\nSo this `t=2` strategy is possible if `N_comp >= 2`.\n\nExample: `C1: L1={1}, R1={2,3}`. `C2: L2={4}, R2={5,6}`.\n`|L1|=1, |R1|=2`. `|L2|=1, |R2|=2`. `t=1` is not possible for either.\n`w2` for `(C1, C2)`:\n`(|L1|*|L2| + |R1|*|R2|) * (|L1|*|R2| + |R1|*|L2|)`\n`= (1*1 + 2*2) * (1*2 + 2*1)`\n`= (1+4) * (2+2) = 5 * 4 = 20`.\nSo `t=2, w=20`.\n\nThis `t=2` calculation looks correct.\nSo, the `t=2` logic is:\n  `w2 = 0`.\n  For `i` from `0` to `len(comp_info)-1`:\n    For `j` from `i+1` to `len(comp_info)-1`:\n      `L_i, R_i = comp_info[i]`.\n      `L_j, R_j = comp_info[j]`.\n      `w2 += (L_i*L_j + R_i*R_j) * (L_i*R_j + R_i*L_j)`.\n  If `w2 > 0`: print `2 w2`. Exit.\n\nThis covers `n=3, m=0` case: `comp_info = [(1,0), (1,0), (1,0)]`.\n`w2 = 0`.\n`L_i=1, R_i=0`. `L_j=1, R_j=0`.\n`w2 += (1*1 + 0*0) * (1*0 + 0*1) = 1 * 0 = 0`.\nSo `w2` remains 0.
