There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Understanding and Approaching the \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem. My goal is to maximize profit from building houses, subject to zoning restrictions. Let's break this down. We have `n` spots, each with a maximum height of `h`, and `m` restrictions.  Each spot gives a profit proportional to the square of its height. Restrictions are in the form of `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`, meaning the tallest house between spots `l_j` and `r_j` can't exceed `x_j`.\n\nThe constraints are small (`n`, `h`, `m` <= 50), which is great!  It means I can probably use a brute-force or dynamic programming approach without worrying too much about time complexity, something like O(n*h*m) or O(n^2*h) might work.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze these restrictions. For each spot `i`, the actual height of the house, `height[i]`, must be within bounds. It must be less than or equal to `h`, and also, for every restriction that covers spot `i`, it must be less than or equal to the restriction's height limit (`x_j`).\n\nThis leads me to think about an \"effective maximum allowed height\" for each spot.  Let's call it `max_allowed_height[i]`. Initially, it's just `h`. Then, for each restriction, I need to update this `max_allowed_height`. For a restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`, I'll iterate through each spot `k` from `l_j` to `r_j` and set `max_allowed_height[k] = min(max_allowed_height[k], x_j)`. Essentially, I'm finding the tightest upper bound on each spot's height based on all restrictions.\n\nNow, let's verify my interpretation. If I build houses where each `height[i]` is equal to its `max_allowed_height[i]`, will I satisfy all the restrictions? Consider an arbitrary restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`. I need to ensure that the maximum height within this range doesn't exceed `x_j`. By construction, any `max_allowed_height[k]` for a spot `k` within `[l_j, r_j]` will be less than or equal to `x_j` after processing the restriction, since we took the minimum. That means, `max(max_allowed_height[k] for k in [l_j, r_j]) <= x_j`.  Therefore, this construction satisfies all the restrictions!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots, subject to `m` zoning restrictions. For each spot `i`, we can build a house of integer height `a` (where `0 <= a <= h`), gaining `a^2` dollars. Each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` states that the tallest house in the range `[l_j, r_j]` must be at most `x_j`.\n\nLet's determine the maximum possible height for each individual spot.\nFor any spot `k` (from `1` to `n`), its height `height[k]` must satisfy two conditions:\n1. `0 <= height[k] <= h`: This is the general maximum height allowed for any house.\n2. For every restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)` such that spot `k` is within the range `[l_j, r_j]` (i.e., `l_j <= k <= r_j`), the height `height[k]` must be at most `x_j`. If `height[k]` were greater than `x_j`, then the maximum height in the range `[l_j, r_j]` would also be greater than `x_j`, violating the restriction.\n\nCombining these conditions, for each spot `k`, its height `height[k]` must be less than or equal to `h`, and also less than or equal to `x_j` for all restrictions `j` that cover spot `k`. This implies that `height[k]` must be less than or equal to the minimum of `h` and all relevant `x_j` values.\n\nLet `max_allowed_height[k]` be the maximum possible height for a house at spot `k` without violating any restriction. We can initialize `max_allowed_height[k] = h` for all `k` from `1` to `n`. Then, for each restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`, we iterate through all spots `k` from `l_j` to `r_j` and update `max_allowed_height[k] = min(max_allowed_height[k], x_j)`.\n\nAfter processing all `m` restrictions, `max_allowed_height[k]` will store the absolute maximum height that a house at spot `k` can have while satisfying all individual restrictions that apply to it.\n\nNow, consider the configuration where we set `height[k] = max_allowed_height[k]` for every spot `k`.\nLet's verify if this configuration satisfies all zoning restrictions.\nFor any restriction `(l_j, r_j, x_j)`:\nWe need to ensure that `max(height[k] for k in [l_j, r_j]) <= x_j`.\nBy construction, for any `k` in the range `[l_j, r_j]`, when we processed restriction `j`, we updated `max_allowed_height[k]` with `min(..., x_j)`. This means that `max_allowed_height[k]` (and thus `height[k]`) is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `x_j` for all `k` in `[l_j, r_j]`.\nTherefore, `max(height[k] for k in [l_j, r_j])` will indeed be less than or equal to `x_j`.\nSo, setting `height[k] = max_allowed_height[k]` for all `k` satisfies all restrictions.\n\nSince the profit for a house of height `a` is `a^2`, and `a^2` is an increasing function for non-negative `a`, to maximize profit, we should choose the largest possible height for each house. The largest possible height for house `k` is precisely `max_allowed_height[k]`.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to build a house of height `max_allowed_height[k]` at each spot `k`. The total maximum profit will be the sum of squares of these heights: `sum(max_allowed_height[k]^2 for k in [1, n])`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize an array `heights` of size `n`, where `heights[i] = h` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1` (using 0-indexed array for spots 1 to `n`).\n2. For each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\n   Iterate `k` from `l_i-1` to `r_i-1` (adjusting for 0-indexing).\n   Update `heights[k] = min(heights[k], x_i)`.\n3. Calculate the total profit: `sum(h_val * h_val for h_val in heights)`.\n4. Print the total profit.\n\n**Example 1 walkthrough:**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nInitial `heights = [3, 3, 3]`\n\n1. Restriction `1 1 1`: `l=1, r=1, x=1`\n   For spot `0` (index for 1): `heights[0] = min(heights[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`\n   `heights = [1, 3, 3]`\n\n2. Restriction `2 2 3`: `l=2, r=2, x=3`\n   For spot `1` (index for 2): `heights[1] = min(heights[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`\n   `heights = [1, 3, 3]`\n\n3. Restriction `3 3 2`: `l=3, r=3, x=2`\n   For spot `2` (index for 3): `heights[2] = min(heights[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`\n   `heights = [1, 3, 2]`\n\nFinal heights: `[1, 3, 2]`\nTotal profit: `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Initialization: `O(n)`\n- Processing restrictions: `m` restrictions, each potentially affecting `n` spots.
