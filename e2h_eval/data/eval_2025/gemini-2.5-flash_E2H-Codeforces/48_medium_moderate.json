            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script that can convert a number from one base to another. The input is the original base, the target base (which can be an integer or \"R\" for Roman numerals), and the number itself in the original base.\n\nMy plan is to break this down into three core steps:\n\n1.  **Read the Input**: Get the original base (`a`), the target base (`b_str`), and the number string (`c_str`) from the user. Convert the original base (`a`) to an integer.\n2.  **Convert to Decimal**: First, convert the input number (`c_str`) from base `a` to its decimal (base 10) representation. I'll need a function for this, `to_decimal()`. This function will handle digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for bases greater than 10.\n3.  **Convert to Target Base**: Now, based on what `b_str` is, determine the last step.\n    *   **Integer Base**: If `b_str` is an integer, I need to convert the decimal number to the new base. I'll create a function `from_decimal()` for this, also handling the character mapping for digits and letters.\n    *   **Roman Numerals**: If `b_str` is \"R\", convert the decimal number to Roman numerals. I'll need a `to_roman()` function for this. I'll need to define the Roman numeral rules for values from 1 to 3000, handling the subtractive principle.\n\nI'll start by outlining the functions with the details on what I'll need in each part, and the expected inputs, outputs, and the mapping for digits. I will then go over edge cases like leading zeros.\nI will handle cases that the number will be zero. I will also have checks for each step.\n\nOnce I have the logic for each step clear, I'll put it all together.\n\nI will test with example values, including cases with Roman numerals, to ensure the code is correct.\n",
