He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem, and my current strategy:**\n\nOkay, so I need to maximize profit by dividing a list of problem difficulties into a fixed number of days, with the profit for a day being the maximum difficulty solved that day.  The key insight is that the optimal profit will always involve solving problems with the *k* largest difficulties.  So, first things first, I'm going to find those k largest values. Their sum is the maximum profit.\n\nNow, the trick is figuring out how to partition the original array so that each of those k largest values becomes the maximum for its segment. I've realized that the *order* of the numbers in the array matters, not just the values themselves.\n\nI need to make k-1 cuts.  I'm thinking of creating a sorted list containing index pairs that consist of each difficulty value in the original array, along with its original array index. The sorted order is by value from largest to smallest.\nThen I take the top k indices of these pairs. Those values are the indices that will define the cuts. The number of problems within each segment are defined by these cuts.\n\nI need to make the segments such that I keep these top k values as the max of each day's segment. My current approach to ensure the largest k values are the maximum of each segment is to make my cuts after these indices.  The lengths are now defined by these cut points.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to partition `n` problems with difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n` into `k` contiguous segments (days). Each day's profit is the maximum difficulty among problems solved that day. We need to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output the maximum profit and the number of problems solved each day (`t_1, ..., t_k`).\n\n**Understanding the Goal**\n\nTo maximize the sum of `k` maximums, we should intuitively pick the `k` largest values from the entire array `a`. If we can ensure that each of these `k` largest values becomes the maximum of one of the `k` days, then their sum will be the maximum possible total profit. This is because any other set of `k` values would sum to less than or equal to the sum of the `k` largest values.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Identify the `k` largest difficulties:**\n    *   Store each problem's difficulty along with its original index. For example, `(a_i, i)`.\n    *   Sort these pairs in descending order based on difficulty.\n    *   Take the top `k` pairs. These `k` difficulties are the ones that will contribute to our maximum total profit.\n    *   The maximum total profit is the sum of these `k` difficulties.\n\n2.  **Determine the problem distribution (`t_j` values):**\n    *   From the `k` chosen pairs, extract their original indices. Let these be `idx_1, idx_2, ..., idx_k`.\n    *   Sort these `k` indices in ascending order. These sorted indices `s_idx_1 < s_idx_2 < ... < s_idx_k` represent the positions of the `k` problems that will be the maximums for their respective days.\n    *   We need to make `k-1` cuts to divide the `n` problems into `k` segments. To ensure that each `a[s_idx_j]` becomes the maximum of its segment, and to simplify the distribution, we can make cuts *immediately after* the problems at indices `s_idx_1, s_idx_2, ..., s_idx_{k-1}`.\n    *   The first day will solve problems from index `0` up to `s_idx_1`. Its length `t_1 = s_idx_1 + 1`.\n    *   The second day will solve problems from index `s_idx_1 + 1` up to `s_idx_2`. Its length `t_2 = s_idx_2 - s_idx_1`.\n    *   ...\n    *   The `j`-th day (for `1 < j < k`) will solve problems from index `s_idx_{j-1} + 1` up to `s_idx_j`. Its length `t_j = s_idx_j - s_idx_{j-1}`.\n    *   The `k`-th day will solve problems from index `s_idx_{k-1} + 1` up to `n-1`. Its length `t_k = (n-1) - (s_idx_{k-1} + 1) + 1 = n - s_idx_{k-1} - 1`.\n    *   This specific way of making cuts ensures that each `a[s_idx_j]` is included in its segment, and since it's one of the `k` largest values overall, it will be the maximum within its segment (as long as we don't include other problems larger than it in the same segment, which is handled by making cuts at these points). This strategy provides a valid distribution.\n\n**Example Walkthrough**\n\nLet `n = 8, k = 3`, `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Pairs (difficulty, index):**\n    `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n\n2.  **Sort by difficulty (descending) and take top `k=3`:**\n    `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n    Top 3 are: `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`\n    Maximum total profit = `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n\n3.  **Extract and sort indices:**\n    Original indices of chosen problems: `6, 3, 0`.\n    Sorted indices `s_idx`: `[0, 3, 6]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate `t_j` values:**\n    *   `s_idx_1 = 0`\n    *   `s_idx_2 = 3`\n    *   `s_idx_3 = 6`\n\n    *   `t_1` (problems from `0` to `s_idx_1`): `s_idx_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n        Problems: `[a[0]] = [5]`. Max is `5`.\n    *   `t_2` (problems from `s_idx_1+1` to `s_idx_2`): `s_idx_2 - s_idx_1 = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n        Problems: `[a[1], a[2], a[3]] = [4, 2, 6]`. Max is `6`.\n    *   `t_3` (problems from `s_idx_2+1` to `n-1`): `n - (s_idx_2 + 1) = 8 - (3+1) = 8 - 4 = 4`.\n        Problems: `[a[4], a[5], a[6], a[7]] = [5, 1, 9, 2]`. Max is `9`.\n\n    The `t_j` values are `[1, 3, 4]`.\n    Total profit `5+6+9 = 20`.\n    This matches the total profit, and provides a valid distribution. The example output `3 2 3` is also valid, as the problem allows any correct distribution.\n\n**Complexity**\n\n*   Creating pairs: O(N)\n*   Sorting pairs: O(N log N)\n*   Summing `k` values: O(k)\n*   Extracting and sorting `k` indices: O(k log k)\n*   Calculating `t_j`: O(k)\n\nOverall time complexity: O(N log N) due to sorting.\nSpace complexity: O(N) to store pairs and indices.\n\nGiven `N <= 2000`, O(N log N) is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Create a list of (difficulty, original_index) pairs\n    problems_with_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        problems_with_indices.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort these pairs by difficulty in descending order\n    # If difficulties are equal, the order of indices doesn't matter for profit,\n    # but sorting by index ascending can provide a consistent tie-breaking.\n    # However, for finding the k largest values, only the difficulty matters.\n    problems_with_indices.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Step 3: Select the top k problems for maximum profit\n    chosen_problems = problems_with_indices[:k]\n\n    # Calculate maximum total profit\n    max_total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in chosen_problems)\n\n    # Step 4: Get the original indices of these k chosen problems\n    chosen_indices = sorted([p[1] for p in chosen_problems])\n\n    # Step 5: Determine the lengths of segments (t_j values)\n    t_values = []\n    current_start_index = 0\n    for i in range(k - 1):\n        # The cut is made after the problem at chosen_indices[i]\n        # So the segment goes from current_start_index to chosen_indices[i]\n        segment_length = chosen_indices[i] - current_start_index + 1\n        t_values.append(segment_length)\n        current_start_index = chosen_indices[i] + 1\n    \n    # The last segment goes from current_start_index to n-1\n    last_segment_length = n - current_start_index\n    t_values.append(last_segment_length)\n\n    # Print results\n    print(max_total_profit)\n    print(*(t_values))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
