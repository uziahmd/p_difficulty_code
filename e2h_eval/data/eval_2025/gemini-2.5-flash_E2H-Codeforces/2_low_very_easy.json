Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Crafting an Efficient 'X' Shape Detector in Python**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of identifying 'X' shapes in a character grid. The core idea is pretty straightforward, but I need to ensure my Python implementation is robust and efficient. Here's my thought process:\n\nFirst, the rules. An 'X' shape means all characters on the diagonals must be identical, all characters *not* on the diagonals must be identical, and importantly, the diagonal character must be different from the non-diagonal character. Also, n is odd, a constraint I can leverage.\n\nMy strategy? I'm going to read the grid into a 2D structure, probably a list of lists of characters.  Then, I'll iterate through each cell.  During this iteration, I'll need to identify if a cell is part of a diagonal, either the main one (`row == col`) or the anti-diagonal (`row + col == n - 1`).\n\nI'll keep track of two characters: `diag_char` for the diagonals and `other_char` for everything else.  I'll initialize both to `None`. As I loop, the first time I encounter a character on the diagonal, I'll assign it to `diag_char`.  Subsequent diagonal characters need to match this.  The same applies to `other_char` for the non-diagonal cells. If I ever find a mismatch, I immediately know it's not an 'X', and I can stop.\n\nOnce I've iterated through the entire grid without any mismatches, I'll have all the pieces. I just need to verify that `diag_char` and `other_char` are different. If they are, I print \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nThere are a few edge cases to keep in mind, even though `n` is guaranteed to be odd, the smallest possible grid size is 3x3. I know the input will be valid small English letters.\n\nI've even run through a simple example in my head with a 3x3 grid to make sure this logic flows smoothly.  I'm confident I can efficiently solve this.\n",
