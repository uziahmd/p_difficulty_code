The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling \"The Number Games\" Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Number Games\" problem, and my initial thought is, \"Python solution, let's go!\" The core is to find a way to minimize the sum of fans *removed* while ensuring the remaining districts form a connected subgraph. Since the graph is a tree, this connected subgraph condition is manageable.\n\nI quickly recognized the critical piece: maximizing the remaining districts' fan count, which translates to minimizing the fans *removed*. And the nature of `2^i` makes it clear: keep the districts with the highest indices. It's essentially a greedy approach, and that's the angle I'll pursue.\n\nThe real challenge is the \"connected subgraph\" constraint. I need to balance the greedy desire to keep large indices with the need for connectivity. My brain started turning: if I'm removing districts, what's left must be connected. Keeping *n* seems essential, then *n-1*, and so on.\n\nThinking it through, I came up with a greedy approach, starting with the highest index, *n*. I'll build my connected component downwards, adding a district only if it's connected to the existing component (or *n* initially). The goal is to keep as many high-index districts as possible while maintaining that \"all connected\" rule. It's about efficiently building a connected subgraph from the top down. This ensures that I end up with the remaining *n-k* districts and minimize the total fans removed.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove `k` contestants out of `n` such that the remaining `n-k` contestants form a connected component in the given tree structure, and the total sum of fans `2^i` for the remaining contestants is maximized. We need to output the indices of the `k` removed contestants in increasing order.\n\n**Key Idea:**\nTo maximize the sum of `2^i`, we should prioritize keeping contestants with larger district numbers `i`, because `2^i` grows exponentially with `i`. For example, `2^10` is much larger than the sum of `2^1` through `2^9`.\n\nThis suggests a greedy strategy:\n1.  We want to keep `n-k` contestants.\n2.  Start by selecting the contestant from district `n` (the largest index). This forms our initial connected component.\n3.  Iterate downwards from district `n-1` to district `1`. For each district `i`:\n    *   If we still need to select more contestants (i.e., the number of selected contestants is less than `n-k`), and district `i` is \"reachable\" from our current connected component, then we should select district `i`.\n    *   What does \"reachable\" mean? If district `i` is adjacent to any district already in our component, then adding `i` will maintain connectivity. If `i` is not adjacent to any node in the component, but one of its neighbors is already in the component, then `i` is connected. More generally, if `i` is part of the connected component formed by the already selected nodes and `i` itself, then we can add `i`.\n\nThe most straightforward way to implement this \"reachable\" check efficiently is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the largest index node `n`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Build the graph:** Store the tree structure using an adjacency list.\n2.  **Identify nodes to keep:**\n    *   Initialize a boolean array `kept[1...n]` to `false`.\n    *   Initialize a queue for BFS and add district `n` to it. Mark `kept[n]` as `true`.\n    *   Initialize `count_kept = 1` (for district `n`).\n    *   While the queue is not empty and `count_kept < n-k`:\n        *   Dequeue a node `u`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n            *   If `v` has not been kept yet (`kept[v]` is `false`) and `count_kept < n-k`:\n                *   Mark `kept[v]` as `true`.\n                *   Enqueue `v`.\n                *   Increment `count_kept`.\n    *   This BFS ensures that we explore nodes in increasing order of their distance from `n`. However, we want to prioritize nodes with larger indices.\n\n    A better greedy approach for prioritizing larger indices:\n    *   Initialize a boolean array `kept[1...n]` to `false`.\n    *   Initialize a queue for a modified BFS/DFS. Add district `n` to it. Mark `kept[n]` as `true`.\n    *   Initialize `count_kept = 1`.\n    *   Initialize a set `removed_nodes`.\n    *   Iterate `i` from `n-1` down to `1`:\n        *   If `kept[i]` is already `true`, continue (this means `i` was reached and marked as kept by a larger indexed neighbor).\n        *   If `count_kept < n-k`:\n            *   Check if `i` is adjacent to any node `j` such that `kept[j]` is `true`.\n            *   If yes, mark `kept[i]` as `true`, increment `count_kept`.\n            *   If no, add `i` to `removed_nodes`.\n        *   Else (`count_kept == n-k`), we have enough nodes. All remaining nodes (from `i` down to `1`) that are not yet marked `kept` must be removed. Add `i` to `removed_nodes`.\n    *   This approach is still problematic because `kept[j]` might be true for a `j` that was picked *later* in the `i` loop but is smaller than `i`. This is not a standard BFS.\n\n    **The correct greedy approach:**\n    We want to keep `n-k` nodes. To maximize `sum(2^i)`, we should keep the `n-k` nodes that include `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on, *as long as they form a connected component*.\n    This means we should start with `n` and then \"grow\" the component by adding the largest possible available neighbor.\n\n    This problem is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that maximizes the sum of node weights. Since weights are `2^i`, we greedily try to include nodes with larger `i`.\n\n    Consider the nodes in decreasing order of their index: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\n    We start with a set of `n` nodes. We want to remove `k` of them.\n    The nodes we *keep* must form a connected component.\n    This means the nodes we *remove* must be chosen such that the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component.\n\n    The simplest way to achieve the goal is to think about *which nodes to remove*. We want to remove `k` nodes that have the smallest possible `2^i` values, *while maintaining connectivity for the rest*.\n    This means we should prioritize removing nodes with small indices.\n    Let's try to remove `k` nodes, starting from `1`, then `2`, etc.\n    We can't just remove `1, 2, ..., k` because that might disconnect the graph.\n\n    **Correct Approach (BFS from the \"most valuable\" node):**\n    1.  The node with the highest value is `n`. We definitely want to keep `n`.\n    2.  We need to select `n-k` nodes.\n    3.  Perform a BFS/DFS starting from node `n`.\n    4.  During the traversal, keep track of visited nodes. The first `n-k` distinct nodes visited by the traversal (in the order they are first visited) will form a connected component including `n`.\n    5.  However, this doesn't prioritize larger indices among equally distant nodes.\n\n    **The optimal greedy strategy is to select nodes in decreasing order of their index, but only if they are part of the component we are building from `n`.**\n    This means we need to find the `n-k` nodes that form a connected component and include `n`, and also maximize the sum of `2^i`. This is equivalent to finding the `n-k` nodes in the component that have the largest indices.\n\n    Let `S` be the set of nodes we decide to keep. Initially, `S = {n}`. We also maintain a `visited` array or set.\n    We need to select `n-k` nodes.\n    A more robust approach:\n    1.  Initialize `kept_count = 0`.\n    2.  Initialize `removed_nodes = []`.\n    3.  Initialize `is_kept` array to `false` for all nodes.\n    4.  Initialize a deque `q` for BFS.\n    5.  Add node `n` to `q`. Mark `is_kept[n] = true`. `kept_count = 1`.\n    6.  The crucial part: We need to ensure that the `n-k` nodes we keep are connected. The nodes we keep must form a connected component.\n    7.  We can identify the `k` nodes to remove by finding the `k` \"least valuable\" nodes that can be removed without disconnecting the remaining `n-k` nodes.\n\n    Consider the nodes `1, 2, ..., n`. We want to remove `k` of them.\n    The nodes we keep must be connected.\n    The maximum `sum(2^i)` means we want to keep the largest possible `i` values.\n    The set of nodes we keep must always contain `n`.\n    We can perform a BFS/DFS starting from `n` to find all nodes that are reachable from `n`. This is all nodes in the tree.\n    Let `p[i]` be the parent of node `i` in a BFS tree rooted at `n`.\n    We want to keep `n-k` nodes. We want to keep `n`, `n-1`, `n-2`, ... as much as possible.\n\n    Let's try a different perspective:\n    We want to remove `k` nodes. Which `k` nodes should we remove? The ones with the smallest indices, such that the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component.\n    This means we should try to remove node `1`. If removing `1` doesn't disconnect the graph (assuming `1` is not `n` and has neighbors), then we can remove it.\n    This is complex because removing a node might disconnect its neighbors.\n\n    **The simplest and correct greedy strategy:**\n    1.  The maximum value node `n` must be kept.\n    2.  We need to select `n-k` nodes.\n    3.  We can use a modified BFS/DFS. Start with `n`.\n    4.  We want to keep `n-k` nodes.\n    5.  The nodes that are *not* kept are the `k` removed nodes.\n    6.  Initialize `kept` array to all `False`.\n    7.  Initialize `removed_list` to store indices of removed nodes.\n    8.  Initialize `q` (a deque) for BFS. Add `n` to `q`. Mark `kept[n] = True`.\n    9.  `num_kept = 1`.\n    10. While `q` is not empty and `num_kept < n-k`:\n        *   `u = q.popleft()`\n        *   Collect all unkept neighbors of `u`: `neighbors_to_consider = []`\n            For each `v` in `adj[u]`:\n                If `not kept[v]`:\n                    `neighbors_to_consider.append(v)`\n        *   Sort `neighbors_to_consider` in *decreasing* order of index. This is the crucial greedy step: among available neighbors, pick the one with the largest index first.\n        *   For each `v` in `neighbors_to_consider` (in decreasing order):\n            If `num_kept < n-k`:\n                Mark `kept[v] = True`.\n                Add `v` to `q`.\n                `num_kept += 1`.\n            Else:\n                Break (we have enough nodes).\n    11. After the BFS, iterate `i` from `1` to `n`. If `not kept[i]`, add `i` to `removed_list`.\n    12. Sort `removed_list` and print.\n\n    This modified BFS ensures that we always expand our connected component by adding the largest possible index neighbor first, thus maximizing the sum of `2^i`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Sample 1):**\n`n=6, k=3`\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`\nAdjacency List:\n1: [2]\n2: [1, 6, 4, 3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2, 5]\n\nWe need to keep `n-k = 6-3 = 3` nodes.\n\n1.  Initialize `kept = [F,F,F,F,F,F,F]` (index 0 unused).\n2.  `removed_list = []`.\n3.  `q = deque()`.\n4.  Add `n=6` to `q`. `kept[6] = True`. `num_kept = 1`.\n    `q = [6]`. `kept = [F,F,F,F,F,T,T]`\n\n5.  `num_kept = 1 < 3`.\n    `u = q.popleft() = 6`. `q = []`.\n    Neighbors of 6: `[2, 5]`.\n    Unkept neighbors: `[2, 5]` (both `kept[2]` and `kept[5]` are `F`).\n    Sort in decreasing order: `[5, 2]`.\n\n    *   Consider `v=5`: `num_kept = 1 < 3`.\n        `kept[5] = True`. Add `5` to `q`. `num_kept = 2`.\n        `q = [5]`. `kept = [F,F,F,F,T,T,T]`\n    *   Consider `v=2`: `num_kept = 2 < 3`.\n        `kept[2] = True`. Add `2` to `q`. `num_kept = 3`.\n        `q = [5, 2]`. `kept = [F,T,F,F,T,T,T]`\n\n6.  Now `num_kept = 3`. We have kept `n-k` nodes. The loop condition `num_kept < n-k` is false. The BFS stops.\n\n7.  Iterate `i` from 1 to 6 to find removed nodes:\n    *   `i=1`: `kept[1]` is `F`. Add 1 to `removed_list`. `removed_list = [1]`.\n    *   `i=2`: `kept[2]` is `T`. (kept)\n    *   `i=3`: `kept[3]` is `F`. Add 3 to `removed_list`. `removed_list = [1, 3]`.\n    *   `i=4`: `kept[4]` is `F`. Add 4 to `removed_list`. `removed_list = [1, 3, 4]`.\n    *   `i=5`: `kept[5]` is `T`. (kept)\n    *   `i=6`: `kept[6]` is `T`. (kept)\n\n8.  `removed_list = [1, 3, 4]`. Sort it: `[1, 3, 4]`.\n9.  Print `1 3 4`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Building adjacency list: O(N)\n*   BFS: Each node is enqueued/dequeued once. Each edge is visited twice (once from each direction). Sorting neighbors takes `O(degree * log(degree))`. In total, `sum(degree_u * log(degree_u))` over all `u`. In a tree, `sum(degree_u) = 2(N-1)`. In the worst case, a star graph, one node has degree `N-1`, so `O(N log N)`.\n*   Iterating to find removed nodes: O(N)\n*   Sorting `removed_list`: `O(k log k)` which is at most `O(N log N)`.\n\nOverall complexity: `O(N log N)` due to sorting neighbors in BFS. Given `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is feasible (`10^6 * log(10^6) approx 10^6 * 20 = 2 * 10^7`).\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # We need to keep n-k contestants.\n    # We want to maximize sum(2^i), so we prioritize larger i.\n    # Start a BFS from node n, always picking the largest available neighbor.\n\n    kept = [False] * (n + 1)\n    q = deque()\n    \n    # Start with the highest value node, n.\n    q.append(n)\n    kept[n] = True\n    num_kept = 1\n\n    # Perform a modified BFS\n    while q and num_kept < n - k:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        \n        # Collect unkept neighbors\n        neighbors_to_consider = []\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            if not kept[v]:\n                neighbors_to_consider.append(v)\n        \n        # Sort neighbors in decreasing order to prioritize larger indices\n        neighbors_to_consider.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        for v in neighbors_to_consider:\n            if num_kept < n - k:\n                kept[v] = True\n                q.append(v)\n                num_kept += 1\n            else:\n                # We have already selected enough nodes, break from adding more neighbors\n                break\n    \n    # Collect indices of removed contestants\n    removed_contestants = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not kept[i]:\n            removed_contestants.append(i)\n            \n    # The problem asks to print k removed contestants,\n    # and our loop condition ensures exactly n-k are kept, so k are removed.\n    # The list is implicitly sorted because we iterate i from 1 to n.\n    \n    print(*(removed_contestants))\n\n# Call the solve function\nsolve()\n\n```",
