The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Rock-Paper-Scissors Losses**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to figure out the number of losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus in a Rock-Paper-Scissors tournament with a massive number of rounds, using repeating move sequences.  My initial thought is that I need to handle the large number of rounds efficiently, which means finding a pattern or cycle.\n\nFirst, I define the game rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. Draws are ignored. Then, I need to account for Nikephoros and Polycarpus’s repeating moves, `A` and `B`. Because their move sequences cycle, I realize the key is to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of these sequences ( `m` and `k` ), that will give me the length of a complete cycle of possible game outcomes.\n\nNow, for any number of rounds (`n`), I calculate the number of complete cycles, plus any remaining rounds, after figuring out the LCM.  Then I’ll simulate a complete cycle (from round 0 to `lcm_mk - 1`) and keep track of losses during that cycle.\n\nAfter a cycle simulation is completed, I can multiply the cycle's losses by the number of complete cycles in the total rounds. Then, calculate the number of remaining rounds to complete the tournament.  I'll then loop through these remaining rounds and count the losses, by simulating the rounds and applying the game rules.\n\nI've got this helper function that compares the moves and determines who is the winner, and that’s integrated into the loop to determine the losses. Finally, I print Nikephoros's and Polycarpus's total losses, and the problem is solved.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of losses for two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, after `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each player uses a cyclic strategy based on a predefined sequence of moves. Nikephoros uses sequence `A` of length `m`, and Polycarpus uses sequence `B` of length `k`.\n\nThe key observation is that the sequence of moves played by both players `(A[round_idx % m], B[round_idx % k])` is periodic. The period of this combined sequence is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`. Since `m` and `k` are at most 1000, their LCM will be at most `1000 * 999 = 999000`. This length is small enough to simulate one full cycle.\n\nThe solution strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine the cycle length:** Calculate `lcm_mk = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor. This `lcm_mk` is the number of rounds after which the game state (the pair of moves played) repeats.\n\n2.  **Simulate one full cycle:** Iterate from round `0` to `lcm_mk - 1`. For each round `i`:\n    *   Nikephoros plays `A[i % m]`.\n    *   Polycarpus plays `B[i % k]`.\n    *   Determine the winner/loser based on Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. If Nikephoros loses, increment `nikephoros_losses_in_cycle`. If Polycarpus loses, increment `polycarpus_losses_in_cycle`. Draws result in no losses for either player.\n\n3.  **Calculate losses from full cycles:**\n    *   Determine how many full `lcm_mk`-round cycles are completed within `n` rounds: `num_full_cycles = n // lcm_mk`.\n    *   Multiply the losses accumulated in one cycle by `num_full_cycles` to get the total losses from these full cycles:\n        `total_nikephoros_losses = num_full_cycles * nikephoros_losses_in_cycle`\n        `total_polycarpus_losses = num_full_cycles * polycarpus_losses_in_cycle`\n\n4.  **Simulate remaining rounds:**\n    *   Calculate the number of rounds remaining after the full cycles: `remaining_rounds = n % lcm_mk`.\n    *   Simulate these `remaining_rounds` (from round `0` to `remaining_rounds - 1`), using the same logic as in step 2, and add any new losses to `total_nikephoros_losses` and `total_polycarpus_losses`.\n\n5.  **Print the results:** Output `total_nikephoros_losses` and `total_polycarpus_losses`.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of `n` (up to 2 * 10^9) because the simulation is only performed for a maximum of `lcm_mk` rounds, which is at most approximately 1 million.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read the total number of rounds\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    # Read Nikephoros's sequence A and Polycarpus's sequence B\n    A = input()\n    B = input()\n\n    # Get the lengths of the sequences\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # Helper function to determine the outcome of a single round\n    # Returns (nikephoros_losses, polycarpus_losses)\n    def get_round_result(nikephoros_move, polycarpus_move):\n        if nikephoros_move == polycarpus_move:\n            return 0, 0  # Draw: no losses for either player\n        \n        # Check if Nikephoros wins (and Polycarpus loses)\n        # Rock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n        # Scissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n        # Paper (P) beats Rock (R)\n        if (nikephoros_move == 'R' and polycarpus_move == 'S') or \\\n           (nikephoros_move == 'S' and polycarpus_move == 'P') or \\\n           (nikephoros_move == 'P' and polycarpus_move == 'R'):\n            return 0, 1  # Nikephoros wins (0 losses), Polycarpus loses (1 loss)\n        else:\n            # If it's not a draw and Nikephoros didn't win, then Nikephoros loses (and Polycarpus wins)\n            return 1, 0  # Nikephoros loses (1 loss), Polycarpus wins (0 losses)\n\n    # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k.\n    # The LCM determines the length of one full cycle of game states.\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm_mk = (m * k) // common_divisor\n\n    # Initialize counters for losses within one full cycle\n    nikephoros_losses_in_cycle = 0\n    polycarpus_losses_in_cycle = 0\n\n    # Simulate one full cycle of lcm_mk rounds to find losses per cycle\n    for i in range(lcm_mk):\n        # Determine moves for the current round in the cycle\n        nikephoros_move = A[i % m]\n        polycarpus_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        # Get the result for this round and accumulate losses for the cycle\n        n_loss, p_loss = get_round_result(nikephoros_move, polycarpus_move)\n        nikephoros_losses_in_cycle += n_loss\n        polycarpus_losses_in_cycle += p_loss\n\n    # Calculate how many full cycles are completed within 'n' rounds\n    num_full_cycles = n // lcm_mk\n    \n    # Calculate initial losses from the full cycles\n    total_nikephoros_losses = num_full_cycles * nikephoros_losses_in_cycle\n    total_polycarpus_losses = num_full_cycles * polycarpus_losses_in_cycle\n\n    # Calculate the number of remaining rounds after the full cycles\n    remaining_rounds = n % lcm_mk\n    \n    # Simulate the remaining rounds (partial cycle) and add to total losses\n    for i in range(remaining_rounds):\n        # Determine moves for the current round in the partial cycle\n        nikephoros_move = A[i % m]\n        polycarpus_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        # Get the result and add to total losses\n        n_loss, p_loss = get_round_result(nikephoros_move, polycarpus_move)\n        total_nikephoros_losses += n_loss\n        total_polycarpus_losses += p_loss\n\n    # Print the final results\n    print(total_nikephoros_losses, total_polycarpus_losses)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
