Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for the Crazy Town Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core idea is to find the *minimum* number of steps to get from a home block to a university block, crossing roads.  Since each step means crossing a road, we're really looking for the number of roads that *separate* the home and university.\n\n*   **Input**: We're given home and university coordinates, the number of roads (`n`), and the equations of those roads (`a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i = 0`).\n*   **Key Insight**: A road (line) divides the plane into two half-planes.  Any point not on the line will have a specific sign for the expression `a*x + b*y + c`.  If two points have *different* signs for a line's equation, they're on opposite sides and need a step (road crossing) to get to each other.\n*   **The Algorithm**: We just go through each road's equation.  For each road, we plug in the home and university coordinates to get two values. If the signs of these values are different (their product is negative), that road needs to be crossed. We increment a step counter each time we find such a road. That count is the minimum steps.\n*   **Why it works**: Each \"block\" or region is defined by which side of each line it's on.  The number of lines separating the home and university blocks is the number of steps.  We only count \"crossings\" -- we don't have to worry about paths, just the separation.\n*   **Implementation**:  A simple Python loop does the trick.  Read the input, calculate the expression (`a*x + b*y + c`), check the signs (using product), and increment the `steps` counter if the signs are opposite.  The final value of `steps` is the answer.  Pretty straightforward and efficient.\n*   **Edge Cases and Constraints**:  The constraints (coordinates, road coefficients) are handled because Python integers can grow, so overflow isn't an issue. The problem guarantees points don't lie on roads, which makes the sign check simpler (no need to account for zero). The number of roads and size are small (up to 300), making the `O(N)` solution perfect.\n*   **Sanity Check:** I went through an example and confirmed it. A quick double-check made sure that the logic holds. All seems good. The code also uses best practices. This should do the trick.\n",
