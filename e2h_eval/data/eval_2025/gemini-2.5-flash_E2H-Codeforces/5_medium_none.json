Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this \"Colored Boots\" problem. As an expert, I see this as a clever disguise for a bipartite matching problem with some interesting constraints.**\n\nMy first thought is always to understand the heart of the problem. We've got `n` left boots and `n` right boots, each with a color (a letter or a '?'). The key is the compatibility rule: two boots match if their colors are identical or if one or both are '?'. We need to maximize the number of compatible pairs and output the indices of those pairs.\n\nThe input format is straightforward. `n`, the length of strings `l` (left boots) and `r` (right boots).\n\nThis screams \"bipartite matching,\" but `n` can go up to 150,000, which suggests that a general, computationally intensive algorithm would be too slow.  We need a smarter, greedy approach, a good optimization strategy.\n\nConsidering the compatibility rules, I realized there's a clear hierarchy in match-making:\n1. **Exact Matches:** The most restrictive. If we don't match them, they might never find a pair.\n2. **Specific Colors with '?'**:  Less restrictive. These can pair, but the '?' is more valuable to the first matches.\n3. **'?' with '?'**: The most flexible. These don't limit any other matches.\n\nThis insight gives us our greedy strategy: prioritize the most restrictive matches first. I'll group the boots by color, keeping track of their indices. I’ll use lists to store the indices, organized by color in a dictionary, both for left and right boots. This will allow for easy retrieval and removal as we make pairs.\n\nHere's my detailed greedy process:\n1. **Specific-Specific Matches:** Iterate through all possible specific colors ('a' to 'z').  For each color, match as many pairs as possible. This ensures we satisfy the most important requirements.\n\n2. **Specific-Indefinite Matches:** After the specific-specific match is done, we match a specific with '?'. This lets more complex options be available.\n\n3. **Indefinite-Indefinite Matches:** Finally, any remaining pairs of '?' boots get paired.\n\nThe heart of this approach is making the most restrictive matches first. This maximizes our chances of finding as many compatible pairs as possible. The '?' boots serve as a bridge, connecting things that have no good alternatives.\n\nThe crucial data structure is the dictionary of lists, keyed by color. This is how I'll keep track of available boots and efficiently find matches. `collections.defaultdict(list)` is perfect here. I'll populate them by iterating through input strings, and the indices are one-based (as requested by the output format).\n\nTo make sure my strategy works, let's step through a few examples in detail. I'll ensure I have the right pair count, and compare with the given examples, verifying that my greedy approach is indeed optimal.\n\nAfter getting the pairings, I'll print the number of pairs and their indices, 1-indexed as required.\n\nThis greedy strategy elegantly handles the problem's constraints, avoiding brute-force or complex algorithms, making this an optimal solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (one left, one right) and list these pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'a' with 'a').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The key idea is to prioritize matches that are most restrictive, leaving more flexible options (like '?' boots) for situations where they are most needed.\n\nThe compatibility rules suggest the following priority for matching:\n\n1.  **Exact specific color matches (e.g., 'a' with 'a'):** These are the most restrictive. If a left boot of color 'a' can be matched with a right boot of color 'a', we should do so. This is because an 'a' boot has limited compatibility (only with 'a' or '?'), and using a '?' boot for it at this stage might prevent that '?' boot from being used for another specific color that has no other options.\n\n2.  **Specific color with indefinite color (e.g., 'a' with '?'):** After all exact specific matches are made, any remaining specific-colored boots can only be matched with '?' boots. We prioritize these matches over '?' with '?' matches because specific-colored boots are still more restrictive than '?' boots. It doesn't matter if we match a left specific boot with a right '?' boot, or a right specific boot with a left '?' boot; both use up one specific boot and one '?' boot.\n\n3.  **Indefinite color with indefinite color ('?' with '?'):** These are the least restrictive matches. Any '?' boots remaining after the previous steps can only be matched with other '?' boots.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Data Structures:** Store the 1-indexed indices of left and right boots, grouped by their color. A `defaultdict(list)` is suitable for this, where keys are colors and values are lists of indices.\n    `left_indices = defaultdict(list)`\n    `right_indices = defaultdict(list)`\n\n    Populate these dictionaries by iterating through the input strings `l` and `r`.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Match specific colors with specific colors.**\n    Iterate through all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'. For each character `c`:\n    While both `left_indices[c]` and `right_indices[c]` are not empty:\n        Pop an index `l_idx` from `left_indices[c]`.\n        Pop an index `r_idx` from `right_indices[c]`.\n        Add the pair `(l_idx, r_idx)` to our `pairs` list.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Match specific colors with indefinite colors.**\n    There are two sub-cases:\n    *   **Left specific with right indefinite:**\n        Iterate through all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'. For each character `c`:\n        While `left_indices[c]` is not empty AND `right_indices['?']` is not empty:\n            Pop an index `l_idx` from `left_indices[c]`.\n            Pop an index `r_idx` from `right_indices['?']`.\n            Add the pair `(l_idx, r_idx)` to our `pairs` list.\n    *   **Right specific with left indefinite:**\n        Iterate through all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'. For each character `c`:\n        While `right_indices[c]` is not empty AND `left_indices['?']` is not empty:\n            Pop an index `l_idx` from `left_indices['?']`.\n            Pop an index `r_idx` from `right_indices[c]`.\n            Add the pair `(l_idx, r_idx)` to our `pairs` list.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Match indefinite colors with indefinite colors.**\n    While both `left_indices['?']` and `right_indices['?']` are not empty:\n        Pop an index `l_idx` from `left_indices['?']`.\n        Pop an index `r_idx` from `right_indices['?']`.\n        Add the pair `(l_idx, r_idx)` to our `pairs` list.\n\n5.  **Output:** Print the total number of pairs found (`len(pairs)`), followed by each pair on a new line.\n\n**Why this greedy strategy is optimal:**\nThis strategy works because it addresses the most constrained matches first. By matching specific colors with their exact counterparts, we ensure those pairings happen, as they offer the least flexibility. Then, specific colors that couldn't find an exact match are paired with '?' boots, which is their only remaining option. Finally, any remaining '?' boots are paired with each other. This ensures that no specific boot is left unpaired if a compatible boot exists, and '?' boots are used efficiently to maximize pairings.\n\n**Complexity:**\n-   **Time Complexity:**\n    -   Populating `left_indices` and `right_indices`: O(N)\n    -   Step 1 (specific-specific matches): Max 26 iterations. In each iteration, `pop()` operations take O(1). Total `pop()` operations are at most N. So, O(N).\n    -   Step 2 (specific-indefinite matches): Max 26 * 2 iterations. Total `pop()` operations are at most N. So, O(N).\n    -   Step 3 (indefinite-indefinite matches): Total `pop()` operations are at most N. So, O(N).\n    -   Printing results: O(N)\n    Overall time complexity: O(N).\n-   **Space Complexity:**\n    -   `left_indices`, `right_indices`: Store up to N indices each. O(N).\n    -   `pairs` list: Stores up to N pairs. O(N).\n    Overall space complexity: O(N).\n\nGiven N <= 150,000, an O(N) solution is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-indexed indices of boots for each color\n    left_indices = defaultdict(list)\n    right_indices = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(l_str):\n        left_indices[char].append(i + 1)\n    for i, char in enumerate(r_str):\n        right_indices[char].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # 1.
