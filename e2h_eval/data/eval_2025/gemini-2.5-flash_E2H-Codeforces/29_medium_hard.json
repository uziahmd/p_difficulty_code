Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Python Solution for Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. It involves this string `s` made of digits, and a bunch of queries where we replace digits with other strings.  The goal is to calculate the numerical value of `s` after all the replacements, modulo a large prime number (1000000007). Leading zeros have to be ignored.\n\nMy initial thought was, \"Let's just do the string replacements.\" But, I quickly realized that the string can grow incredibly fast with each query. Exponential growth is the biggest issue. Replacing \"1\" with \"11\" then \"11\" with \"1111\" leads to a rapid increase in size. So, directly constructing the string is a no-go.\n\nSince calculating the value of a long number is costly, I need a better approach. I realize that the value of the final string `s` can be calculated recursively using `(prefix_value * 10^suffix_length + suffix_value)`. This suggests dynamic programming or a recursive process could work.\n\nThe core idea I settled on is pre-computing, for each digit (0-9), what the digit ultimately becomes in terms of both its numerical value and its length, after considering all the queries.  Two key things to determine: `val[d]` (the transformed numerical value, modulo the large prime), and `len[d]` (the length of the transformed string, modulo (MOD - 1)).\n\nHowever, the order of queries is crucial. The transformations are sequential, meaning the result of one query affects the next.  I figured out that I must process the queries in reverse order to determine a digit's final value considering all its transformation. Think of it as backtracking to figure out how each digit looked *before* a particular query.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I'll maintain two arrays: `current_val` and `current_len`. Initially, `current_val[d]` is simply the digit itself (`d`), and `current_len[d]` is 1 (the initial length of a single digit). Then, process each query from the last to the first. For a query like \"di -> ti\", I use the current, accumulated, values and lengths of all the *digits in* `ti` to derive the new value and length for `di`. Because `ti` itself can be transformed, I trace through it to figure out the value/length of each of the digits present, combining them properly.\n\nWhen processing, I need to keep the numerical values `val` modulo `MOD`. The lengths `len` must be kept modulo `MOD-1` since they are exponents in the calculations (using Fermat's Little Theorem to prevent overflow).\n\nFinally, after processing all queries, I go through the original string `s`, replacing each digit with its final numerical value (and using the final lengths), to calculate the overall numerical value and the length of the string.  The result is modulo the given large prime.\n\nThe time complexity is `O((sum(|ti|) + |s|) * log(MOD))` and space `O(10 + sum(|ti|))`. The time complexity is dominated by the string processing and power calculation. The space complexity comes from queries and temporary storage.  No major optimization is needed with these time and space constraints. I've considered edge cases like empty replacement strings, and empty input strings and confirmed my logic is sound.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then find the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The main challenge is that the string `s` can grow exponentially in length, making direct string manipulation infeasible. The maximum length of `s` and the sum of lengths of replacement strings `ti` are up to `10^5`, and the number of queries `n` is up to `10^5`.\n\nThe key observation for problems involving exponential growth is often to process operations in reverse or to find a way to compute the final result without explicitly constructing the intermediate states.\n\nLet's define two arrays for each digit `d` from 0 to 9:\n1. `val[d]`: The numerical value that a single digit `d` transforms into after all queries are applied, modulo 1000000007.\n2. `len[d]`: The length of the string that a single digit `d` transforms into after all queries are applied. Since these lengths will be used as exponents for powers of 10, they need to be taken modulo `(1000000007 - 1)` due to Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nThe queries are applied sequentially, and newly introduced digits are also subject to subsequent transformations. This means if we have `2->0` then `0->7`, an initial `2` will become `0`, and then that `0` will become `7`. This implies that the transformations for a digit `d` depend on the transformations of the digits in its replacement string `ti` *after* `d` has been replaced. This dependency structure suggests processing queries in reverse.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Set `MOD = 1000000007` and `MOD_MINUS_1 = MOD - 1`.\n    *   For each digit `d` from 0 to 9:\n        *   `val[d] = d` (A single digit `d` initially has value `d`).\n        *   `len[d] = 1` (A single digit `d` initially has length `1`).\n\n2.  **Process Queries in Reverse:**\n    Iterate through the queries from the last one (`n-1`) down to the first one (`0`).\n    For each query `di -> ti`:\n    *   We are determining what `di` transforms into *before* this specific query. After this query, `di` effectively becomes the string `ti`.\n    *   We need to calculate `new_val_di` and `new_len_di` based on `ti` and the *current* `val` and `len` arrays (which reflect the transformations from queries *after* the current one).\n    *   Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through each character `c` in `ti` from left to right:\n        *   Let `digit_c = int(c)`.\n        *   The value of `ti` is built by concatenating the values of its constituent digits. When we append `val[digit_c]` to `new_val_di`, `new_val_di` shifts left by `len[digit_c]` decimal places.\n        *   `new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, len[digit_c], MOD) + val[digit_c]) % MOD`\n        *   The total length `new_len_di` is the sum of lengths of its constituent digits.\n        *   `new_len_di = (new_len_di + len[digit_c]) % MOD_MINUS_1`\n    *   After iterating through `ti`, update `val[int(di)] = new_val_di` and `len[int(di)] = new_len_di`.\n    *   Special case: If `ti` is an empty string, `new_val_di` will remain `0` and `new_len_di` will remain `0`. This correctly represents an empty string. `pow(10, 0, MOD)` is 1, so if `len[digit_c]` is 0, it means the digit transforms into an empty string, and `10^0` correctly models no shift in place value.\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Value of Initial String `s`:**\n    After processing all queries in reverse, the `val` and `len` arrays hold the final transformations for each initial digit.\n    *   Initialize `final_result = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through each character `c` in the initial string `s` from left to right:\n        *   Let `digit_c = int(c)`.\n        *   Similar to step 2, accumulate the value:\n            `final_result = (final_result * pow(10, len[digit_c], MOD) + val[digit_c]) % MOD`\n    *   The `final_result` will be the numerical value of the transformed string `s` modulo `MOD`. This approach naturally handles leading zeros (e.g., \"007\" becomes 7) and empty strings (if `s` transforms into an empty string, `final_result` will be 0).\n\n**Complexity:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Initialization: O(10).\n    *   Processing queries: For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. The total length of all `ti` strings is at most `10^5`. Inside the loop, `pow(10, exponent, MOD)` takes `O(log MOD)` time. So, this part is `O(sum(|ti|) * log MOD)`.\n    *   Final calculation: We iterate through the initial string `s`. The length of `s` is at most `10^5`. This part is `O(|s| * log MOD)`.\n    *   Total time complexity: `O((sum(|ti|) + |s|) * log MOD)`. Given `|s| <= 10^5`, `sum(|ti|) <= 10^5`, and `log MOD` is small (approx 30 for `10^9+7`), this is efficient enough (`(10^5 + 10^5) * 30` operations, roughly `6 * 10^6`).\n\n*   **Space Complexity:**\n    *   `val` and `len` arrays: O(10).\n    *   Storing queries: `O(n + sum(|ti|))`.\n    *   Total space complexity: `O(n + sum(|ti|))`. This is also within limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        parts = line.split(\"->\")\n        queries.append((parts[0], parts[1]))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_MINUS_1 = MOD - 1 # For exponents, using Fermat's Little Theorem\n\n    # current_val[d] stores the numerical value that a single digit d transforms into\n    # current_len[d] stores the length of the string that a single digit d transforms into\n    # (used for exponents, so modulo MOD_MINUS_1)\n    \n    current_val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    current_len = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    # This ensures that when we calculate the transformation for a digit 'di',\n    # the 'val' and 'len' of digits within its replacement string 'ti'\n    # already reflect all subsequent transformations.\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di_char, ti_str = queries[i]\n        digit_to_replace = int(di_char)\n\n        new_val_di = 0\n        new_len_di = 0\n\n        # Calculate the new value and length for digit_to_replace based on ti_str\n        # Iterate through ti_str from left to right\n        for char_in_ti in ti_str:\n            digit_in_ti = int(char_in_ti)\n            \n            # The length current_len[digit_in_ti] is the exponent for 10\n            # It must be modulo MOD_MINUS_1 because it's used in pow(10, exponent, MOD)\n            exponent = current_len[digit_in_ti]\n            \n            # Accumulate value: new_val_di = (new_val_di * 10^exponent + current_val[digit_in_ti]) % MOD\n            # pow(10, exponent, MOD) calculates (10^exponent) % MOD\n            new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, exponent, MOD) + current_val[digit_in_ti]) % MOD\n            \n            # Accumulate length: new_len_di = (new_len_di + current_len[digit_in_ti]) % MOD_MINUS_1\n            # Lengths are accumulated modulo MOD_MINUS_1 to prevent overflow for exponents\n            new_len_di = (new_len_di + exponent) % MOD_MINUS_1\n        \n        # Update the transformation for digit_to_replace\n        current_val[digit_to_replace] = new_val_di\n        current_len[digit_to_replace] = new_len_di\n\n    # After processing all queries, calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_result = 0\n\n    for char_s in s:\n        digit_s = int(char_s)\n        \n        # The length current_len[digit_s] is the exponent for 10\n        exponent = current_len[digit_s]\n        \n        # Accumulate value: final_result = (final_result * 10^exponent + current_val[digit_s]) % MOD\n        final_result = (final_result * pow(10, exponent, MOD) + current_val[digit_s]) % MOD\n        \n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_result) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
