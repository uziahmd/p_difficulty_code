The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Gilded Cell Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this gilded cell problem. My goal is a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate.  Here's what I'm thinking:\n\nFirst, let's nail down the dimensions. I'm assuming  `w` is the width (number of columns) and `h` is the height (number of rows), which feels more standard. The problem uses `w` and `h` interchangeably, so I'll stay consistent with my understanding.  The logic should still hold even if that wasn't the intended order, due to symmetry.  We also have `k`, the number of rings to consider.\n\nEach ring is basically the border of an inner rectangle. The dimensions of this inner rectangle shrink with each ring.  Specifically, the `i`-th ring is the perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions  `(w - 4(i - 1)) x (h - 4(i - 1))`.  The first ring is the outer edge of the entire plate (`w x h`), the second ring is the next rectangle in, and so on.\n\nNow, how do I calculate the cell count for a single ring? It's the perimeter of this inner rectangle.  I know the formula is  `2 * W + 2 * H - 4`, where `W` and `H` are the width and height of the rectangle. Or, alternatively, `W * H - (W - 2) * (H - 2)`, which handles cases with small dimensions.  I've confirmed that the constraints ensure `current_w` and `current_h` are at least 3 for all relevant `k` values, so that simpler formula will do.\n\nTo efficiently calculate the perimeter for each ring, I'll iterate through the rings. For each ring `i`, I need to calculate `current_w` and `current_h` using `w - 4(i - 1)` and `h - 4(i - 1)`, apply the perimeter formula, and sum it all up.\n\nIt's good to double-check the constraints though. `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)` is important because it dictates when the inner rectangle shrinks to zero size or less, which is invalid. However, since the minimal size of current width or height for any ring is greater or equal than 3, this constraint ensures valid calculations throughout. So, the constraint is good. I think I'm ready to code this up now.\n",
