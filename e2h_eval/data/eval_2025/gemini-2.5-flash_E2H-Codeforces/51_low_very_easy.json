Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the \"Amusing Joke\" Problem: My Pythonic Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Amusing Joke\" problem to tackle, and it's a classic character frequency comparison. Here's my thought process:\n\nFirst, I need to read the input: three strings, the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.  The core of the problem is figuring out if the pile contains *exactly* the letters from the guest and host names, just jumbled up. Lengths must match, character counts must align.\n\nMy solution will go something like this: I can combine the guest and host names, then count the occurrences of each letter. I can then do the same thing for the pile of letters. Finally, a simple comparison of the character counts should tell me whether I have a match. This approach leverages the most straightforward method: using frequency maps, which can be implemented with dictionaries or arrays of size 26.\n\nI should create a `combined_names` string and two counters, one for the `combined_names` and one for the `pile_letters`, and then check if they are identical. Since this is Python, using `collections.Counter` seems like the most elegant way to handle this. It simplifies the counting logic considerably.  It handles the counting without me having to write too many loops, which is exactly what I like to do in a coding challenge.\n\nLooking at the example, it's clear the frequencies will line up perfectly if the joke works. Let's make sure the script is concise, readable, and efficient. I'm going to knock this one out quickly.\n",
