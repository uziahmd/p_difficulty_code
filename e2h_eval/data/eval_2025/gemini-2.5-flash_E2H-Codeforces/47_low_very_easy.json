His goal is to find a non-negative integer $$$k$$$ such that the least common multiple of $$$a+k$$$ and $$$b+k$$$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $$$k$$$, he needs to choose the smallest one.Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem.

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Neko Does Maths Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Neko Does Maths\" problem, and my goal is to find a Python script to solve it efficiently. The core of it is finding a non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k`. If there are ties for the minimum LCM, I want the smallest `k`.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking, let's substitute. Let `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. The problem is now to minimize `lcm(x, y)`. I know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.  This means minimizing the LCM boils down to managing the relationship between the product `x * y` and their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\nNow, let's say `g = gcd(x, y)`. Since `g` divides both `x` and `y`, it must also divide their difference, `y - x`. And `y - x = (b+k) - (a+k) = b - a`. Therefore, `g` has to be a divisor of `b - a`. This is a crucial observation.\n\nLet's call `diff = abs(b - a)`. There's a special case to consider: if `a = b`, then `diff = 0`.  In this scenario, `gcd(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. The LCM will also be `a+k`. To minimize this, I just need the smallest possible `k`, which is `k=0`. Easy.\n\nIf `a != b`, then `diff` is a positive integer. Now, the GCD of `a+k` and `b+k` must be a divisor of `diff`. I'm starting to see a strategy here: I need to iterate through all the divisors of `diff`.\n\nFor a given divisor `g` of `diff`, I need to find the smallest non-negative `k` that makes `gcd(a+k, b+k) = g`.  If I can find that `k` for *each* divisor `g`, I can then compute the LCM and keep track of the one that yields the smallest LCM.\n\nSince `b+k = a+k + diff`, if `a+k` is a multiple of `g`, and `g` is a divisor of `diff`, then `b+k` is automatically also a multiple of `g`. So I need to make `a+k` a multiple of `g`. Let's say `a+k = m * g` where `m` is an integer. Then `k = m * g - a`. I want the *smallest* non-negative `k`. This means finding the smallest multiple of `g` that's greater than or equal to `a`.\n\nI can express this as `M_g = g * ceil(a / g)`.  Using integer division, this becomes `M_g = g * ((a + g - 1) // g)` or, more concisely, using the modulo operator, `M_g = a + (g - (a % g)) % g`.\n\nNow, if `a` is a multiple of `g` (i.e., `a % g == 0`), then `k = 0`. Otherwise, `k = g - (a % g)`.  This gives me `k_g`, the value of `k` for a given divisor `g`.\n\nSo, for each divisor `g` of `diff`, I calculate `k_g`, calculate `x = a+k_g` and `y = b+k_g`, compute `lcm(x,y)`, and track the smallest LCM.\n\nNow I have a pretty solid plan for the Python script - find all the divisors of `diff`, iterate over them calculating the corresponding `k` values, calculate LCMs and find the minimal case. This should do it. Let's get coding!\n",
