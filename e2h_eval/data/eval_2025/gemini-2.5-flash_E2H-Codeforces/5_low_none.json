Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Colored Boots Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Colored Boots\" problem, which seems like a classic maximum matching scenario. The goal is to pair up left and right boots based on their colors, maximizing the number of compatible pairs. I've got to maximize the number of pairs.\n\nThe input includes the number of boots, `n`, and strings `l` and `r` representing the colors of the left and right boots, respectively.  The colors are lowercase letters or '?'.  A specific color matches only itself, while '?' is compatible with anything.  Each boot can only be used once.\n\nMy initial thought is to categorize the boots into groups: left with specific colors, left with indefinite colors, right with specific, and right with indefinite. I'm thinking a list of indices for each character (a-z) and '?' would be an efficient data structure. This will help me prioritize the matching.\n\nMy strategy is to be greedy, focusing on the most restrictive matches first. I'll prioritize exact matches (specific color with the same specific color) because those are the most crucial. Then, I'll move on to matching specific colors with '?'. Finally, any remaining '?' boots can be matched with each other.  I'll use a `pairs` list to store the compatible pairs. It's a structured approach that should work well given the problem's constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots and to output these pairs. A boot can be part of at most one pair. Compatibility rules are:\n1.  Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2.  An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite) (e.g., '?' and 'z', 'a' and '?', '?' and '?').\n\nThis is a maximum matching problem. A greedy approach works best by prioritizing the most restrictive matches first.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices by Color:**\n    First, we need to efficiently access boots of a specific color. We can use lists to store the original 1-based indices of boots for each color. Let `left_indices[char]` be a list of indices for left boots of color `char`, and `right_indices[char]` for right boots. We'll use a dictionary or an array of lists for this, mapping characters 'a'-'z' and '?' to their respective lists.\n\n2.  **Greedy Matching Steps:**\n    We process matches in decreasing order of restrictiveness:\n\n    *   **Step 1: Exact Specific Color Matches (e.g., 'a' with 'a')**\n        These are the most restrictive matches. For each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z', we match as many left `c` boots with right `c` boots as possible.\n        We iterate through `c` from 'a' to 'z'. While there are available left boots of color `c` and available right boots of color `c`, we form a pair and add their indices to our result list.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Specific Color with Indefinite Color (e.g., 'a' with '?' or '?' with 'a')**\n        After exact matches, we have remaining specific-colored boots and all the indefinite ('?') boots. A specific color `c` can match a `?`.\n        For each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n        *   Match remaining left `c` boots with available right `?` boots.\n        *   Match remaining left `?` boots with available right `c` boots.\n        Again, we form pairs and add their indices to the result list.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Indefinite Color with Indefinite Color (e.g., '?' with '?')**\n        Finally, any remaining left `?` boots can be matched with any remaining right `?` boots.\n        We match as many left `?` boots with right `?` boots as possible.\n\n**Detailed Implementation:**\n\n1.  **Data Structures:**\n    We'll use `collections.defaultdict(list)` for `left_indices` and `right_indices`. This allows us to easily append indices to lists that are created on first access.\n    The `pairs` list will store tuples `(left_boot_index, right_boot_index)`.\n\n2.  **Populating Indices:**\n    Iterate `i` from `0` to `n-1`:\n    *   `left_indices[l[i]].append(i + 1)` (using 1-based indexing for output).\n    *   `right_indices[r[i]].append(i + 1)`.\n\n3.  **Matching Logic (as described above):**\n    *   **Step 1:**\n        ```python\n        for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n            char = chr(char_code)\n            while left_indices[char] and right_indices[char]:\n                pairs.append((left_indices[char].pop(), right_indices[char].pop()))\n        ```\n    *   **Step 2:**\n        ```python\n        for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n            char = chr(char_code)\n            while left_indices[char] and right_indices['?']:\n                pairs.append((left_indices[char].pop(), right_indices['?'].pop()))\n            while left_indices['?'] and right_indices[char]:\n                pairs.append((left_indices['?'].pop(), right_indices[char].pop()))\n        ```\n    *   **Step 3:**\n        ```python\n        while left_indices['?'] and right_indices['?']:\n            pairs.append((left_indices['?'].pop(), right_indices['?'].pop()))\n        ```\n\n4.  **Output:**\n    Print `len(pairs)`.\n    Then, for each `(l_idx, r_idx)` in `pairs`, print `l_idx r_idx`.\n\n**Why this greedy approach is optimal:**\n\n*   **Prioritizing exact matches (`c` with `c`):** An exact match `c`-`c` uses up two boots that can *only* be matched with `c`. If we didn't match them, one of the `c` boots might be matched with a `?`. But then the other `c` boot would still need a `c` or a `?`. By matching `c`-`c`, we use the most restrictive resources first, leaving `?` boots available for less restrictive matches later.\n*   **Prioritizing specific with indefinite (`c` with `?`):** After `c`-`c` matches, remaining `c` boots can only match `?` boots. A `?` boot can match anything. If we use a `?` boot for a `c` boot, we are using a flexible resource for a less flexible one. This is generally good because it keeps other `?` boots available for other specific colors or for other `?` boots.\n*   **Finally, indefinite with indefinite (`?` with `?`):** These are the least restrictive matches. By this point, all specific-colored boots that could be matched have been matched (either with their exact color or with a `?`). Any remaining `?` boots can only be matched with other `?` boots.\n\nThis greedy strategy ensures that no optimal match is missed by making a suboptimal choice early on because more restrictive choices are always handled first, preserving the flexibility of `?` boots for when they are most needed.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Populating `left_indices` and `right_indices`: O(N) because we iterate through the input strings once.\n    *   Matching steps: Each boot index is added to a list once and popped from a list once. Appending and popping from Python lists (which are dynamic arrays) are amortized O(1) operations. There are 27 lists for each side. The loops iterate through these lists, and the `while` conditions ensure each boot is processed at most once. Therefore, the total time for matching is O(N).\n    *   Overall time complexity: O(N).\n*   **Space Complexity:**\n    *   `left_indices` and `right_indices` store N indices in total.\n    *   `pairs` list stores up to N pairs.\n    *   Overall space complexity: O(N).\n\nGiven N up to 150,000, an O(N) solution is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-based indices of boots for each color\n    left_indices = defaultdict(list)\n    right_indices = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_indices[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_indices[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match exact specific colors (e.g., 'a' with 'a')\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_indices[char] and right_indices[char]:\n            l_idx = left_indices[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices[char].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Step 2: Match specific colors with indefinite colors (e.g., 'a' with '?' or '?' with 'a')\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        # Match remaining left specific boots with right '?' boots\n        while left_indices[char] and right_indices['?']:\n            l_idx = left_indices[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n        # Match remaining left '?' boots with right specific boots\n        while left_indices['?'] and right_indices[char]:\n            l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices[char].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Step 3: Match indefinite colors with indefinite colors (e.g., '?' with '?')\n    while left_indices['?'] and right_indices['?']:\n        l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()\n        r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()\n        pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Output results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for l_idx, r_idx in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
