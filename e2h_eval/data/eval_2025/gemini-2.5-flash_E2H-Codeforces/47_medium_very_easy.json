    "thought": "**Alright, here's the game plan for tackling this \"Neko does Maths\" problem.**  My goal is to figure out the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k`.  Since I'm dealing with LCM, which is closely tied to the greatest common divisor (GCD), I'll be leveraging that relationship: `lcm(x,y) = (x*y) / gcd(x,y)`.\n\nFirst, I need to recognize a key insight:  if `d` is the GCD of `a+k` and `b+k`, then `d` must also divide the difference `b-a`.  This means I only need to consider divisors of `b-a` as potential GCDs. I will, without loss of generality, assume that `a <= b` and work from this assumption.\n\nI'll iterate through all the divisors of `diff = b-a`. For each divisor `d`, I need to find the smallest `k` that ensures that both `a+k` and `b+k` are divisible by `d`. To get that `k`, I can calculate `k = (d - (a % d)) % d`. This formula cleverly uses modular arithmetic to find the smallest non-negative `k`. If `a` is already a multiple of `d`, then `k` is conveniently `0`.\n\nFor each `k` obtained, I'll calculate `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`, compute the current GCD and LCM. I'll maintain `min_lcm` with its `best_k` value. When I encounter a smaller LCM or an LCM that is equal to the current minimum, I will compare and select the smallest `k` to ensure the smallest optimal `k` is returned.\n\nThere are certain edge cases I've already tested for. Most importantly is the situation where `a == b`.  In this scenario, `k = 0` provides an optimal solution.\n\nLet me now implement this in a Python script.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized. If multiple `k` values yield the same minimum `lcm`, we should choose the smallest such `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know that `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nA key property of `gcd` is that `gcd(X, Y)` must divide `|X - Y|`.\nIn our case, `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must divide `|(b+k) - (a+k)| = |b - a|`.\nLet `diff = abs(b - a)`. So, `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `diff`.\n\nThis insight allows us to iterate through all possible values for `d = gcd(a+k, b+k)`. Since `d` must be a divisor of `diff`, we can find all divisors of `diff` and consider each one.\n\nFor each divisor `d` of `diff`:\n1. We need to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `d` is a common divisor of `a+k` and `b+k`.\n2. If `d` divides `a+k`, then `a+k` must be a multiple of `d`. This means `(a+k) % d == 0`.\n3. The smallest non-negative `k` satisfying this is `k = (d - (a % d)) % d`.\n   - If `a % d == 0`, then `k = (d - 0) % d = 0`. In this case, `a` is already a multiple of `d`.\n   - If `a % d != 0`, then `k = d - (a % d)`. In this case, `a+k = a + (d - (a % d))` will be a multiple of `d`.\n4. With this `k`, `a+k` is a multiple of `d`. Since `d` is a divisor of `diff = b-a`, `b-a` is also a multiple of `d`.\n5. Then `b+k = (a+k) + (b-a)`. Since both `a+k` and `b-a` are multiples of `d`, their sum `b+k` must also be a multiple of `d`.\n6. Thus, for this `k`, `d` is a common divisor of `a+k` and `b+k`. This implies `gcd(a+k, b+k)` will be some multiple of `d` (it could be exactly `d`, or `2d`, `3d`, etc.).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Handle `a == b`:** If `a` equals `b`, then `lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize `a+k`, we choose the smallest non-negative `k`, which is `0`. Print `0` and exit.\n\n2.  **Ensure `a <= b`:** For consistent calculations, swap `a` and `b` if `a > b`. This doesn't change `abs(b-a)` or the `lcm`.\n\n3.  **Calculate `diff = b - a`**.\n\n4.  **Find all divisors of `diff`**: Iterate `i` from `1` up to `sqrt(diff)`. If `i` divides `diff`, then both `i` and `diff // i` are divisors. Store these in a set to avoid duplicates.\n\n5.  **Initialize `min_lcm` to infinity and `best_k` to `0`**. `k=0` is always a valid candidate.\n\n6.  **Iterate through each `d` in the set of divisors**:\n    *   Calculate `k = (d - (a % d)) % d`. This is the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `d`.\n    *   Let `val_a = a + k` and `val_b = b + k`.\n    *   Calculate `current_gcd = math.gcd(val_a, val_b)`.\n    *   Calculate `current_lcm = (val_a // current_gcd) * val_b`. (Using `// current_gcd` first helps prevent potential intermediate overflow if `val_a * val_b` is extremely large, though Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle this automatically).\n    *   **Compare and update:**\n        *   If `current_lcm < min_lcm`: Update `min_lcm = current_lcm` and `best_k = k`.\n        *   If `current_lcm == min_lcm`: Update `best_k = min(best_k, k)` to ensure we pick the smallest `k`.\n\n7.  **Print `best_k`**.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (a=6, b=10):**\n\n1.  `a != b`. `a=6, b=10`.\n2.  `diff = 10 - 6 = 4`.\n3.  Divisors of `4`: `1, 2, 4`.\n4.  Initialize `min_lcm = inf`, `best_k = 0`.\n\n    *   **For `d = 1`**:\n        *   `k = (1 - (6 % 1)) % 1 = 0`.\n        *   `val_a = 6+0 = 6`, `val_b = 10+0 = 10`.\n        *   `current_gcd = gcd(6, 10) = 2`.\n        *   `current_lcm = (6 * 10) // 2 = 30`.\n        *   `min_lcm = 30`, `best_k = 0`.\n\n    *   **For `d = 2`**:\n        *   `k = (2 - (6 % 2)) % 2 = 0`.\n        *   `val_a = 6+0 = 6`, `val_b = 10+0 = 10`.\n        *   `current_gcd = gcd(6, 10) = 2`.\n        *   `current_lcm = (6 * 10) // 2 = 30`.\n        *   `current_lcm == min_lcm`, so `best_k = min(0, 0) = 0`.\n\n    *   **For `d = 4`**:\n        *   `k = (4 - (6 % 4)) % 4 = (4 - 2) % 4 = 2`.\n        *   `val_a = 6+2 = 8`, `val_b = 10+2 = 12`.\n        *   `current_gcd = gcd(8, 12) = 4`.\n        *   `current_lcm = (8 * 12) // 4 = 24`.\n        *   `current_lcm < min_lcm` (24 < 30), so `min_lcm = 24`, `best_k = 2`.\n\n5.  All divisors processed. Print `best_k = 2`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   `a, b <= 10^9`.\n*   `diff` can be up to `10^9 - 1`.\n*   Finding divisors takes `O(sqrt(diff))` time, which is `O(sqrt(10^9))` or about `31622` operations.\n*   The maximum number of divisors for a number up to `10^9` is `576` (for `735134400`).\n*   For each divisor, we perform constant time arithmetic operations and one `gcd` calculation. `math.gcd` is efficient (logarithmic in the input values).\n*   Overall complexity is dominated by finding divisors and then iterating through them, which is very efficient for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # If a == b, then lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k.\n    # To minimize a+k, we choose the smallest non-negative k, which is 0.\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Ensure a <= b for consistent calculation of diff.\n    # The problem does not state a <= b, so we handle it.\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    diff = b - a\n\n    # Find all divisors of diff.\n    # These divisors are the possible values for d = gcd(a+k, b+k).\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):\n        if diff % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(diff // i)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0 # Initialize best_k. k=0 is always a valid non-negative k.\n\n    # Iterate through each possible divisor 'd' of 'diff'.\n    # For each 'd', we find the smallest non-negative 'k' such that 'a+k' is a multiple of 'd'.\n    # Since 'd' divides 'diff = b-a', if 'a+k' is a multiple of 'd', then 'b+k = (a+k) + (b-a)' will also be a multiple of 'd'.\n    # This ensures that 'd' is a common divisor of 'a+k' and 'b+k'.\n    for d in divisors:\n        # Calculate the smallest non-negative k such that (a+k) is a multiple of d.\n        # This is equivalent to k % d == (-a) % d.\n        # If a % d == 0, k = 0.\n        # If a % d != 0, k = d - (a % d).\n        k = (d - (a % d)) % d\n        \n        val_a = a + k\n        val_b = b + k\n        \n        # Calculate gcd(a+k, b+k).\n        # Note: gcd(a+k, b+k) will be a multiple of d, not necessarily d itself.\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(val_a, val_b)\n        \n        # Calculate lcm(a+k, b+k) = ( (a+k) * (b+k) ) / gcd(a+k, b+k)\n        # Using (val_a // current_gcd) * val_b to prevent potential overflow if val_a * val_b is very large\n        # before division, though Python's arbitrary precision integers handle this automatically.\n        current_lcm = (val_a // current_gcd) * val_b\n\n        # Update min_lcm and best_k if a better solution is found.\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            # If lcm is the same, choose the smallest k.\n            best_k = min(best_k, k)\n\n    print(best_k)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program.\nsolve()\n\n```",
