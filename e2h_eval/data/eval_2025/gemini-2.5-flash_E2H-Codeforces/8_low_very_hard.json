Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing \"Flawed Flow\" for a Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Flawed Flow\" problem, and I need to come up with a Python solution. Let's break down these conditions.  We've got a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, which is standard. The input includes the edge details: `ai`, `bi`, and the flow volume `ci`. The goal is to orient each edge (either `ai -> bi` or `bi -> ai`) such that the resulting directed graph satisfies several conditions.\n\nFirst, we need flow conservation: for every intermediate vertex (excluding the source and sink), the incoming flow must equal the outgoing flow. The source (vertex 1) is special; it has no incoming edges.  The sink (vertex `n`)... the wording is a little ambiguous, it just says flow conservation applies to vertices `1 < v < n`, so let's stick with that. The key constraint is the graph must be acyclic. This is the biggest hint.\n\nLooking at the conditions again, specifically the requirement for an acyclic graph combined with flow conservation, something clicks. This *has* to be a DAG, right?  If it's acyclic, we can topologically sort the vertices. And if we can find directions that satisfy flow conservation across all those intermediate nodes while simultaneously being acyclic, we have a solution.\n\nLet's think about the net flow at each vertex. For the vertices in the middle, it has to be zero; inflow equals outflow. The source's net flow is solely the sum of outgoing edges, since it has no incoming edges. For the sink, we don't have an explicit constraint beyond the flow conservation for the other vertices, so let's keep that in mind. This is pointing towards some kind of topological sorting and, probably, a greedy approach, perhaps?  The guarantees are helpful, especially the connectedness and that a solution exists - that simplifies things!  Time to start thinking about the implementation details.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to direct each edge $(a_i, b_i)$ with a given flow volume $c_i$ such that:\n1. For any vertex $v$ ($1 < v < n$), the sum of incoming flow equals the sum of outgoing flow.\n2. Vertex 1 (source) has no incoming edges.\n3. The resulting directed graph is acyclic.\n\nWe need to output 0 if the edge is directed $a_i \\to b_i$ and 1 if $b_i \\to a_i$.\n\nThe key conditions are acyclicity and flow conservation. Acyclicity implies that if we direct an edge $u \\to v$, then $u$ must \"come before\" $v$ in some topological ordering. This suggests that flow generally moves from \"earlier\" vertices to \"later\" vertices.\n\nConsider the net flow for each vertex. For an edge $(u, v)$ with flow $c$, if we direct it $u \\to v$, then $u$ sends $c$ units and $v$ receives $c$ units. If $v \\to u$, then $v$ sends $c$ units and $u$ receives $c$ units.\nLet $F_v$ be the net flow *out* of vertex $v$.\nFor $1 < v < n$, flow conservation means $F_v = 0$.\nFor vertex 1, it has no incoming edges, so $F_1 = \\sum_{\\text{edges } (1,x)} c_x$ (assuming all are $1 \\to x$). This sum is the total max flow value.\nFor vertex $n$, there's no explicit condition. However, if all flow originates at 1 and must be conserved at intermediate nodes, it must all eventually arrive at $n$. So, $F_n = -\\sum_{\\text{edges } (x,n)} c_x$ (assuming all are $x \\to n$).\n\nThe condition $F_v=0$ for $1 < v < n$ can be rephrased: for each such $v$, $\\sum_{\\text{edges } (v,x)} \\text{flow_out}(v,x) - \\sum_{\\text{edges } (x,v)} \\text{flow_in}(x,v) = 0$.\nLet's define a \"balance\" for each vertex. For an edge $(u,v)$ with capacity $c$, if we direct it $u \\to v$, $u$ loses $c$ and $v$ gains $c$. If $v \\to u$, $v$ loses $c$ and $u$ gains $c$.\nLet $B_v$ be the \"current balance\" of vertex $v$, initially 0. When we decide an edge $(u,v)$ with flow $c$ is $u \\to v$, we update $B_u \\leftarrow B_u - c$ and $B_v \\leftarrow B_v + c$.\nThe goal is to achieve $B_v = 0$ for $1 < v < n$, $B_1 \\le 0$ (or just $B_1 = -\\text{total flow}$ if we count it as flow *into* the source), and $B_n \\ge 0$ (or $B_n = \\text{total flow}$ if we count it as flow *out of* the sink).\n\nThe acyclicity condition is key. A common way to ensure acyclicity is to process vertices in a topological order. However, we don't know the topological order yet, as it depends on our chosen directions.\n\nConsider the problem from the perspective of \"excess flow\". For each vertex $v$, let $S_v = \\sum_{(v,x) \\text{ or } (x,v)} c_x$ be the total flow through all edges incident to $v$. If we direct an edge $(v,u)$ as $v \\to u$, $v$ \"sends\" $c$ units. If we direct it $u \\to v$, $v$ \"receives\" $c$ units.\nFor $1 < v < n$, we need $\\sum_{\\text{out of } v} c_i = \\sum_{\\text{into } v} c_j$.\nThis means that for each vertex $v \\in \\{2, \\dots, n-1\\}$, the sum of flows on edges directed *away* from $v$ must be equal to the sum of flows on edges directed *towards* $v$.\n\nThe problem can be modeled as finding a topological sort. Since a solution is guaranteed to exist, there must be *some* set of directions that forms a DAG and satisfies flow conservation.\nA common technique for problems involving DAGs and flow-like properties is to use a queue-based approach (like Kahn's algorithm for topological sort) or DFS.\n\nLet's try a DFS approach. We want to direct edges such that we don't form cycles.\nThe source vertex 1 must have all its edges outgoing.\nThe sink vertex $n$ will eventually receive all flow.\n\nWhat if we try to determine the direction of edges greedily?\nSuppose we have a vertex $v \\in \\{2, \\dots, n-1\\}$ where we have already decided directions for some incident edges.\nLet $I_v$ be the sum of flows of edges already directed *into* $v$.\nLet $O_v$ be the sum of flows of edges already directed *out of* $v$.\nFor any remaining undirected edge $(v, u)$ with flow $c$:\nIf we direct it $v \\to u$: $O_v \\leftarrow O_v + c$.\nIf we direct it $u \\to v$: $I_v \\leftarrow I_v + c$.\nWe need $I_v = O_v$ when all incident edges are directed.\n\nThis problem structure often implies that if we have a way to define a \"potential\" or \"level\" for each node, say $P_v$, then all edges must go from $P_u < P_v$ to $P_v$.\nThe problem statement guarantees a solution exists. The acyclicity condition is very strong.\n\nLet's consider the total flow out of vertex 1. Let this be $F_{total}$. This flow must eventually reach vertex $n$.\nFor any vertex $v$, let $D_v$ be its \"deficit\" or \"surplus\" of flow. Initially, $D_1 = -F_{total}$, $D_n = F_{total}$, and $D_v=0$ for $1 < v < n$.\nWhen we direct an edge $u \\to v$ with flow $c$, we update $D_u \\leftarrow D_u + c$ and $D_v \\leftarrow D_v - c$.\nOur goal is to make $D_v=0$ for all $v$.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure combined with information about flow balance.\nLet's maintain for each connected component (represented by its root `p`) the total \"net flow\" that needs to exit/enter this component.\nSpecifically, let `balance[v]` be the current net flow *out* of vertex `v` that has been decided so far.\nInitially, `balance[v] = 0` for all $v$.\nWhen we process an edge $(u, v)$ with flow $c$, we need to decide its direction.\nThe crucial insight for this type of problem is to process edges using a DSU structure.\nLet `parent[v]` be the parent of `v` in the DSU tree.\nLet `flow_diff[v]` be the net flow from `v` to `parent[v]` (or `parent[v]` to `v` if negative). More specifically, `flow_diff[v]` stores the sum of flows on edges that are directed *away* from `v` towards `parent[v]` minus the sum of flows on edges directed *towards* `v` from `parent[v]`. This is relative to the parent.\nWhen we find the root `r_u = find(u)` and `r_v = find(v)`:\nIf `r_u == r_v`, then `u` and `v` are already in the same component. This edge forms a cycle if directed. But the graph must be a DAG. This means we must have already processed all edges in the path between `u` and `v` to determine their directions. This implies that the current edge $(u,v)$ must be directed such that it doesn't create a cycle. Since it's guaranteed that a solution exists and the graph is connected, this case with `r_u == r_v` implies that `u` and `v` are already connected *through directed edges*. The flow conservation must be maintained.\n\nA simpler approach for acyclicity is to process vertices in a specific order. Since vertex 1 has no incoming edges, it must be the \"first\" vertex in some topological sort.\nThe problem statement \"the obtained directed graph does not have cycles\" combined with \"a solution always exists\" is a strong hint.\n\nLet's use a DSU structure. Each set in the DSU will represent a connected component of vertices whose relative flow balances have been determined.\nFor each vertex $v$, we need to track its `current_out_flow[v]` and `current_in_flow[v]`.\nInitially, all `current_out_flow[v] = 0` and `current_in_flow[v] = 0`.\nFor each vertex $v \\in \\{2, \\dots, n-1\\}$, the final state must be `current_out_flow[v] = current_in_flow[v]`.\nFor vertex 1, `current_in_flow[1] = 0`.\nFor vertex $n$, no specific rule.\n\nConsider the \"balance\" of each vertex $v$. Let $B_v$ be the sum of $c_i$ for edges directed away from $v$ minus sum of $c_j$ for edges directed towards $v$.\nWe want $B_v = 0$ for $1 < v < n$.\nFor vertex 1, $B_1 = \\text{total flow out of 1}$.\nFor vertex $n$, $B_n = -\\text{total flow into n}$.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding a topological ordering where flow conservation holds.\nThe \"Flawed Flow\" problem is a known problem pattern related to DSU and flow balance.\nLet's maintain `parent[v]` for DSU and `balance[v]` for each vertex. `balance[v]` will store the net flow *out* of $v$ if $v$ is a root, or the net flow *out* of $v$ *relative to its parent* if $v$ is not a root.\nSpecifically, `balance[v]` will be the flow from `v` to `parent[v]` minus flow from `parent[v]` to `v`.\nWhen `find(v)` is called, it returns the root `r` and updates `balance[v]` to be the total flow from `v` to `r` minus flow from `r` to `v`.\n\nInitialize DSU: `parent[v] = v`, `balance[v] = 0` for all $v$.\n`ans` array to store directions.\n\nIterate through edges $(u, v, c)$ in input order:\n`root_u, flow_u_to_root = find(u)`\n`root_v, flow_v_to_root = find(v)`\n\nIf `root_u != root_v`:\n  This edge connects two previously separate components. We can direct it.\n  We want to merge the components. Let's merge `root_v` into `root_u`.\n  `parent[root_v] = root_u`.\n  The new `balance[root_v]` needs to be set.\n  The total flow out of `root_u`'s component is `flow_u_to_root`.\n  The total flow out of `root_v`'s component is `flow_v_to_root`.\n  When we merge `root_v` into `root_u`, the edge $(u,v)$ needs to be directed.\n  The goal is to eventually make `balance[root_u]` and `balance[root_v]` (if they are not 1 or n) zero.\n  This means the flow must eventually be balanced.\n  The flow from `u` to `root_u` is `flow_u_to_root`.\n  The flow from `v` to `root_v` is `flow_v_to_root`.\n  If we direct $u \\to v$:\n    `balance[root_v]` (which is now `parent[root_v]`) becomes `c + flow_v_to_root - flow_u_to_root`.\n    `ans[edge_idx] = 0`.\n  If we direct $v \\to u$:\n    `balance[root_v]` becomes `-c + flow_v_to_root - flow_u_to_root`.\n    `ans[edge_idx] = 1`.\n\nThis specific `balance` update is tricky. Let's redefine `balance[v]` as the net flow *out* of `v` if it's directed towards `parent[v]`.\nSo, if `v -> parent[v]` with flow `f`, `balance[v] = f`.\nIf `parent[v] -> v` with flow `f`, `balance[v] = -f`.\n\nDSU with path compression and storing relative flow:\n`parent[v]`: parent of `v`.\n`flow_to_parent[v]`: flow from `v` to `parent[v]` (positive if `v -> parent[v]`, negative if `parent[v] -> v`).\n\n`find(v)` function:\n  If `parent[v] == v`: return `(v, 0)` (root, 0 net flow to self).\n  `root, flow_to_root = find(parent[v])`\n  `parent[v] = root`\n  `flow_to_parent[v] += flow_to_root` (This adds up flows along the path)\n  Return `(root, flow_to_parent[v])`\n\nInitial state: `parent[i] = i`, `flow_to_parent[i] = 0` for all `i`.\n`ans` array to store results.\n\nFor each edge `(u, v, c)` with index `idx`:\n  `(root_u, total_flow_u_to_root) = find(u)`\n  `(root_v, total_flow_v_to_root) = find(v)`\n\n  If `root_u != root_v`:\n    // Merge components.

This implies there's a unique topological order (up to nodes with same \"level\").\n        The problem states that vertex 1 has no incoming edges. This means all edges incident to 1 must be $1 \\to x$.\n        This gives us a starting point.\n        Let's keep track of `current_flow_balance[v]` for each vertex $v$. This is the sum of flows of edges directed away from $v$ minus sum of flows of edges directed towards $v$.\n        Initially, `current_flow_balance[v] = 0` for all $v$.\n        When we process an edge $(u, v, c)$:\n        If $u=1$: it must be $1 \\to v$. `ans[idx]=0`. `current_flow_balance[1] += c`, `current_flow_balance[v] -= c`.\n        If $v=1$: it must be $1 \\to u$. `ans[idx]=1`. `current_flow_balance[1] += c`, `current_flow_balance[u] -= c`.\n        This doesn't work for general $u,v$.\n\nThe approach that works for this problem is indeed a DSU with flow balancing.\nLet `dsu_parent[i]` be the parent of `i`.\nLet `dsu_flow[i]` be the net flow *from* `i` *to* `dsu_parent[i]`.

(Correct)\n\nMy rule for `root_u != root_v` when neither is 1 or n:\n`abs(current_sum + c)` vs `abs(current_sum - c)`.\nFor `e0=(3,2,10)`: `u=3, v=2, c=10`. `root_u=3, root_v=2`. `flow_u=0, flow_v=0`.\n`current_sum = 0`. `abs(0+10)=10`, `abs(0-10)=10`.\nMy tie-breaking rule was $u \\to v$. So $3 \\to 2$. `ans[0]=0`.\nExample output has $2 \\to 3$. `ans[0]=1`.\nThis means my tie-breaking rule is different from the example's.\nThe problem says \"If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\" So my solution could be valid.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the tie-breaking.\nIf `abs(current_sum + c) == abs(current_sum - c)`, this means `current_sum = 0`.\nSo if `current_sum = 0`, we have `abs(c)` vs `abs(-c)`. Both are `c`.\nIn this case, we can choose either direction for `(u,v)`.\nIf we choose $u \\to v$: `dsu_flow[root_v] = c`.\nIf we choose $v \\to u$: `dsu_flow[root_v] = -c`.\nThe example chose $v \\to u$ for `e0=(3,2,10)`, so $2 \\to 3$. This leads to `dsu_flow[2] = -10` (from $2 \\to 3$).\n\nLet's try again with the rule: if `abs(current_sum + c) <= abs(current_sum - c)`, then $u \\to v$. Else $v \\to u$.\nThis means if `current_sum = 0`, we pick $u \\to v$. This is what I did.\nThe example output implies a different choice.\nThe tie-breaking for `current_sum = 0` (which is `flow_u_to_root_u + flow_v_to_root_v = 0`) must be crucial.\nPerhaps it's always $u \\to v$ if `root_u < root_v`? Or $v \\to u$ if `root_v < root_u`?\nNo, that's arbitrary.\n\nThe special rules for 1 and n are:\nIf `root_u == 1` and `root_v != n`: $u \\to v$.

The specific handling of source/sink roots is important.\nThe logic for `root_u == root_v` also needs to be precise.\n`flow_u_to_root_u` is the net flow from $u$ to $root_u$.\n`flow_v_to_root_v` is the net flow from $v$ to $root_v$.\nSince `root_u == root_v`, let `R = root_u = root_v`.\n`flow_u_to_R` is net flow $u \\leadsto R$.\n`flow_v_to_R` is net flow $v \\leadsto R$.\nThe difference `flow_u_to_R - flow_v_to_R` is the net flow from $u$ to $v$ *through the DSU tree path*.\nIf this value is positive, say $X > 0$, it means $u$ sends $X$ units to $v$ along the path. To balance $u$'s flow, the edge $(u,v)$ must receive $X$ units from $v$. So $v \\to u$.\nIf this value is negative, say $X < 0$, it means $v$ sends $|X|$ units to $u$ along the path. To balance $u$'s flow, the edge $(u,v)$ must send $|X|$ units to $v$. So $u \\to v$.\nSo, if `flow_u_to_R - flow_v_to_R > 0`, then $v \\to u$. `ans[idx] = 1`.\nIf `flow_u_to_R - flow_v_to_R < 0`, then $u \\to v$. `ans[idx] = 0`.\nIt cannot be `0` unless `c=0`, but `c>=1`.\nThis is equivalent to: if `flow_u_to_root_u > flow_v_to_root_v`, direct $v \\to u$. Else ($<0$), direct $u \\to v$.\nMy previous logic for `root_u == root_v` was: `if flow_u_to_root_u > flow_v_to_root_v: ans[idx]=0 else: ans[idx]=1`.\nThis is opposite to what I just derived. Let's re-verify.\nIf `flow_u_to_R - flow_v_to_R = X`.\nIf $X > 0$, path $u \\to \\dots \\to v$ has net flow $X$.\nTo balance $u$: $u$ needs to receive $X$ from $v$ via edge $(u,v)$. So $v \\to u$.\nIf $X < 0$, path $v \\to \\dots \\to u$ has net flow $|X|$.\nTo balance $u$: $u$ needs to send $|X|$ to $v$ via edge $(u,v)$. So $u \\to v$.\nSo, if `flow_u_to_root_u > flow_v_to_root_v` (i.e. $X>0$), then $v \\to u$. `ans[idx]=1`.\nElse ($X<0$), then $u \\to v$. `ans[idx]=0`.\n\nLet's use this refined logic for `root_u == root_v` in Example 1, step 3.\n`e2=(3,1,5)`: `u=3, v=1, c=5`. `root_u=1, flow_u_to_root_u=0`. `root_v=1, flow_v_to_root_v=0`.\n`root_u == root_v`.\n`flow_u_to_root_u = 0`. `flow_v_to_root_v = 0`.\n`flow_u_to_root_u > flow_v_to_root_v` is false.\nSo, $u \\to v$ ($3 \\to 1$). `ans[2]=0`.\n\nThis still gives `1 0 0` for Example 1. The issue is in the `root_u == root_v` logic.\nThe problem statement: \"vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges\".\nIn step 3 of example 1, edge `(3,1,5)` is being directed. `u=3, v=1`.\nIf `3 -> 1`, then 1 has an incoming edge. This violates the rule for vertex 1!\nSo it must be `1 -> 3`. `ans[2]=1`.\n\nThis means the `root_u == root_v` rule needs to incorporate the source/sink constraints.\nIf `u == 1`: must be $1 \\to v$. `ans[idx]=0`.\nIf `v == 1`: must be $1 \\to u$. `ans[idx]=1`.\nIf `u == n`: must be $u \\to v$ if $v \\ne 1$. (Not really, $n$ can be source for an intermediate flow, but it's the sink for total flow).\nThe constraint \"vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges\" is absolute.\nSo if `u=1` and `v` is any other vertex, the edge `(1,v)` must be `1 -> v`.\nIf `v=1` and `u` is any other vertex, the edge `(u,1)` must be `1 -> u`.\n\nLet's try again.\nDSU init: `parent=[0,1,2,3]`, `flow_to_parent=[0,0,0,0]`\n\n1.

The order of `if/else if` statements for source/sink is important. The logic for merging components should always merge one into the other consistently (e.g., `root_v` into `root_u`). The above rules have mixed merging, which is fine as long as the `flow_to_parent` calculation is adjusted. A simpler way is to always merge the smaller root index into the larger, or vice versa. Or just `root_v` into `root_u`.
