They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Playoff Problem: Finding Winning Integers**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this Playoff problem. My primary goal here is to determine all possible \"winning integers\" *x* – skills that can guarantee a team's victory given a certain tournament structure and game outcomes.\n\nThe problem describes a playoff tournament with 2<sup>*n*</sup> teams, each with a unique skill level. The tournament progresses in phases, each characterized by a game result string *s*. A '0' in *s* means the lower-skilled team wins, a '1' the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nEssentially, I'm trying to figure out which skill levels are \"viable\" to win the tournament, given the game result string.\n\nI need to start by understanding the tournament's mechanics. To win, a team with skill *x* has to win *n* games.  The game's outcome dictates whether *x* needs to be the lower or higher skill in each match, based on the string *s*.\n\nLet's say the string *s* has *k0* zeros and *k1* ones. For a team with skill *x* to win, it needs to defeat *k1* teams with skill less than *x* (where the higher-skilled team wins) and *k0* teams with skill greater than *x* (where the lower-skilled team wins). This implies there must be *k1* teams with skill smaller than *x*, and *k0* teams with skill greater than *x*.\n\nThis gives me the critical insight. Since *p* is a permutation of the team skills, it means I need to arrange skills to satisfy the rules dictated by string *s*. It seems like there’s a range for the winning skills, based on *k0* and *k1*. So my thought is that the *x* value for a winning team, must be greater than *k1* (because there need to be at least *k1* teams with lower skill) and less than *2<sup>n</sup> - k0* (because there need to be *k0* teams with higher skill.\n\nLet me think. The condition seems necessary. But is it sufficient?  Can I always arrange the skills such that any *x* within that range can win? If a team with skill *x* has to win $n$ games, the opponents in each game are \"pre-determined\" according to the bracket structure.\n\nI need to make sure I can always construct a winning path for *x* within the bracket. The key is in assigning skills such that, according to the rules in *s*, *x* actually gets the right opponents and beats them.\n\nI keep coming back to a range.  Given the constraints of the game, a skill can win if it falls between *k1* + 1 and 2<sup>*n*</sup> - *k0*. I need to determine if this range allows for a winning scenario. It seems logical, based on the requirements of having a skill smaller and larger than the potential winning skill.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ such that a team with skill $x$ can win a playoff tournament, given a string $s$ of length $n$ that specifies the winning rule for each phase. $s_i = '0'$ means the lower skill team wins in phase $i$, and $s_i = '1'$ means the higher skill team wins in phase $i$. There are $2^n$ teams in total, and $n$ phases.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $x$ to win the tournament.\nTo win, a team must win $n$ games, one in each phase.\nLet $k_0$ be the number of '0's in the string $s$, and $k_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nNote that $k_0 + k_1 = n$.\n\nIf a team with skill $x$ wins:\n1. In $k_0$ games (those corresponding to $s_i = '0'$), $x$ must be the lower skill. This means $x$ must be smaller than its opponent's skill.\n2. In $k_1$ games (those corresponding to $s_i = '1'$), $x$ must be the higher skill. This means $x$ must be greater than its opponent's skill.\n\nFor $x$ to be smaller than $k_0$ distinct opponent skills, there must be at least $k_0$ skill values available that are greater than $x$. The smallest $k_0$ values greater than $x$ would be $x+1, x+2, \\dots, x+k_0$. These must not exceed $2^n$. So, $x+k_0 \\le 2^n$, which implies $x \\le 2^n - k_0$.\n\nFor $x$ to be greater than $k_1$ distinct opponent skills, there must be at least $k_1$ skill values available that are smaller than $x$. The largest $k_1$ values smaller than $x$ would be $x-1, x-2, \\dots, x-k_1$. These must be at least $1$. So, $x-k_1 \\ge 1$, which implies $x \\ge k_1 + 1$.\n\nSo, a necessary condition for $x$ to be a winning skill is $k_1 + 1 \\le x \\le 2^n - k_0$.\n\nNow, we need to show that this condition is also sufficient. That is, if $x$ satisfies $k_1 + 1 \\le x \\le 2^n - k_0$, we can construct a permutation $p$ such that the team with skill $x$ wins.\n\nThe crucial observation is that we can control the skills of all $2^n$ teams. To make a team with skill $x$ win, we need to assign $x$ to one team (say, team 1). Then, for each of its $n$ games, we need to ensure its opponent has a skill value that allows $x$ to win according to $s_i$. The opponents of $x$ themselves are winners of sub-tournaments. However, we can use the remaining $2^n-1$ skill values to ensure that $x$'s $n$ opponents have the desired skills, and that these opponents win their respective sub-tournaments.\n\nSpecifically, we need to pick $k_1$ distinct skill values $y_j < x$ and $k_0$ distinct skill values $y'_j > x$ to be the skills of $x$'s $n$ opponents.\nThe total number of skills needed for $x$ and its $n$ opponents is $n+1$.\nThe remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ skills can be assigned to the other teams in such a way that they lose to their designated opponents, and thus do not interfere with $x$'s path to victory or with its chosen opponents' paths to meet $x$. For example, assign these remaining skills to be very low if $s_i='1'$ is common, or very high if $s_i='0'$ is common, within their sub-brackets.\n\nSince $x \\ge k_1 + 1$, there are at least $k_1$ distinct integers less than $x$ (namely $1, 2, \\dots, k_1$).\nSince $x \\le 2^n - k_0$, there are at least $k_0$ distinct integers greater than $x$ (namely $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-k_0+1$).\nThese $k_1$ values less than $x$ and $k_0$ values greater than $x$ are distinct from $x$ and from each other. So we have enough distinct skills for $x$'s opponents.\n\nThe specific structure of the tournament (e.g., team 1 vs 2, then winner vs winner(3,4)) means that $x$ will play one opponent in phase 1, one in phase 2, ..., one in phase $n$. These $n$ opponents are distinct teams. We can assign the $k_1$ chosen skills less than $x$ to the teams that will be $x$'s opponents in phases where $s_i='1'$. Similarly, we assign the $k_0$ chosen skills greater than $x$ to the teams that will be $x$'s opponents in phases where $s_i='0'$. For any of these $n$ opponents, say with skill $y$, to reach $x$, it must win its own sub-tournament. We can ensure this by assigning $y$ to one of the initial teams in that sub-tournament, and assigning all other $2^k-1$ teams in that sub-tournament skill values that cause them to lose to $y$ according to the rules of phases $1, \\dots, k$ (where $k$ is the number of games $y$ plays before meeting $x$). This is always possible as long as $y$ is not $x$ and $y$ is not one of the other $n-1$ opponents.\n\nTherefore, any integer $x$ satisfying $k_1 + 1 \\le x \\le 2^n - k_0$ is a winning integer.\nThe problem asks for all winning integers in ascending order.\n\nLet's calculate $k_0$ and $k_1$ from the input string $s$.\n$k_0 = s.\\text{count}('0')$\n$k_1 = s.\\text{count}('1')$\nThe range of winning skills is $[k_1 + 1, 2^n - k_0]$.\nWe need to print all integers in this range.\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$k_0 = 1$ (for $s_2 = '0'$)\n$k_1 = 2$ (for $s_1 = '1', s_3 = '1'$)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\nMinimum winning skill: $k_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^n - k_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nThe winning integers are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThe example output is $4, 5, 6, 7$. There is a discrepancy. My analysis suggests $3$ should be included.\nThis indicates my assumption about \"any team can be made to win its sub-bracket\" might be too simplistic.\n\nLet's re-examine the example output.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$, output is `4 5 6 7`.\nMy range is $[3, 7]$.\nThe number of '0's is $k_0$. The number of '1's is $k_1$.\nThe minimum skill that can win is $2^{k_1}$.\nThe maximum skill that can win is $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$.\n\nLet's test this alternative formula:\n$n=3, s=\"101\"$. $k_0=1, k_1=2$.\nMin skill: $2^{k_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\nMax skill: $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1 = 2^3 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\nThis gives the range $[4, 7]$, which matches the example output.\n\nLet's try other examples:\nExample 2: $n=1, s=\"1\"$\n$k_0=0, k_1=1$. $2^n = 2^1 = 2$.\nMin skill: $2^{k_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\nMax skill: $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1 = 2^1 - 2^0 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$.\nRange $[2, 2]$. Output: $2$. Matches.\n\nExample 3: $n=2, s=\"01\"$\n$k_0=1, k_1=1$. $2^n = 2^2 = 4$.\nMin skill: $2^{k_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\nMax skill: $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1 = 2^2 - 2^1 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3$.\nRange $[2, 3]$. Output: $2, 3$. Matches.\n\nThis alternative formula seems correct. Let's try to understand why.\nThe value $2^{k_1}$ represents the minimum possible skill value required to win $k_1$ games where the higher skill wins. If a team needs to win $k_1$ games as the higher skill, it needs to beat $k_1$ opponents with smaller skills. The smallest $k_1$ skills are $1, \\dots, k_1$. If $x$ is to beat them, $x$ must be greater than all of them. But this is not enough.\nThe minimum skill must be $2^{k_1}$ because to win $k_1$ games as the higher skill, the team must be able to beat $k_1$ distinct values that are smaller than it. These $k_1$ values must be distinct. The smallest possible set of values for these opponents would be $\\{1, 2, \\dots, k_1\\}$. The skill $x$ must be greater than these.\nThis argument is still related to the count of smaller/larger values.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that a winning skill $x$ must \"dominate\".\nIf $s_i='1'$, $x$ must be greater than its opponent. This means $x$ must be greater than some skill $y$. To make $y$ win its sub-bracket, $y$ needs to be the highest skill in its sub-bracket (if all rules in that sub-bracket are '1').\nIf $s_i='0'$, $x$ must be smaller than its opponent. This means $x$ must be smaller than some skill $y$. To make $y$ win its sub-bracket, $y$ needs to be the lowest skill in its sub-bracket (if all rules in that sub-bracket are '0').\n\nThe number of teams that could potentially be assigned skills lower than $x$ is $2^{k_1}-1$.\nThe number of teams that could potentially be assigned skills higher than $x$ is $2^{k_0}-1$.\nThis is because if $x$ plays a game where $s_i='1'$, it needs to beat an opponent $y < x$. If $x$ plays a game where $s_i='0'$, it needs to beat an opponent $y > x$.\nThe number of games where $x$ must be the higher skill is $k_1$.\nThe number of games where $x$ must be the lower skill is $k_0$.\n\nConsider the set of all $2^n$ skills $\\{1, \\dots, 2^n\\}$.\nLet $L = 2^{k_1}$ and $R = 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$.\nThe number of skills available for $x$ to be greater than is $x-1$.\nThe number of skills available for $x$ to be smaller than is $2^n-x$.\n\nThe values $1, \\dots, 2^{k_1}-1$ are \"small\" values.\nThe values $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 2, \\dots, 2^n$ are \"large\" values.\nThe remaining values are $2^{k_1}, \\dots, 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$. This is the range $L$ to $R$.\n\nThe reason for $2^{k_1}$ minimum is that $x$ needs to win $k_1$ games where it is the higher skill. In these $k_1$ games, $x$ must beat $k_1$ distinct opponents $y_j < x$. These opponents themselves must win their sub-tournaments. For an opponent $y_j$ to win its sub-tournament, it needs to be assigned a skill $y_j$ that is \"good enough\" in that sub-tournament.\nThe key insight is that to allow a team with skill $x$ to win, we must ensure that $x$ is never forced to be the lower skill in a '1'-phase game, and never forced to be the higher skill in a '0'-phase game.\nThis means $x$ must have at least $k_1$ values smaller than it to beat, and $k_0$ values larger than it to beat.\nThe $k_1$ values smaller than $x$ must be \"eliminable\" by $x$. The $k_0$ values larger than $x$ must be \"eliminable\" by $x$.\nThe number of distinct teams that must have skills less than $x$ (for $x$ to win $k_1$ '1'-games) is $2^{k_1}-1$.\nThe number of distinct teams that must have skills greater than $x$ (for $x$ to win $k_0$ '0'-games) is $2^{k_0}-1$.\nThis means $x$ must be greater than $2^{k_1}-1$ distinct skills. So $x \\ge (2^{k_1}-1)+1 = 2^{k_1}$.\nAnd $x$ must be smaller than $2^{k_0}-1$ distinct skills. So $x \\le 2^n - (2^{k_0}-1) - 1 = 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$.\n\nThis argument makes sense. The minimum $2^{k_1}$ comes from the fact that we need to fill $2^{k_1}-1$ positions in the bracket with values smaller than $x$ for the $k_1$ '1'-games, and the smallest available values are $1, \\dots, 2^{k_1}-1$.\nSimilarly, for the $k_0$ '0'-games, we need to fill $2^{k_0}-1$ positions with values larger than $x$, and the largest available values are $2^n, \\dots, 2^n - (2^{k_0}-1)$.\n\nSo, the minimum winning skill is $2^{k_1}$ and the maximum winning skill is $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$.\nThe range of winning skills is $[2^{k_1}, 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1]$.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count $k_0$ and $k_1$.\n4. Calculate $min\\_win\\_skill = 2^{k_1}$.\n5. Calculate $max\\_win\\_skill = 2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$.\n6. Print all integers from $min\\_win\\_skill$ to $max\\_win\\_skill$ inclusive.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    k0 = s.count('0')\n    k1 = s.count('1')\n\n    # Calculate 2^n efficiently\n    total_teams = 1 << n\n\n    # Minimum winning skill\n    # This is 2^k1 because the winning team needs to beat 2^k1 - 1 other teams\n    # that are necessarily smaller than it in k1 phases where s_i = '1'.\n    # These 2^k1 - 1 teams will occupy skills 1, 2, ..., 2^k1 - 1.\n    # So the winning team must have a skill of at least 2^k1.\n    min_winning_skill = 1 << k1\n\n    # Maximum winning skill\n    # This is 2^n - (2^k0 - 1) = 2^n - 2^k0 + 1.\n    # The winning team needs to beat 2^k0 - 1 other teams\n    # that are necessarily larger than it in k0 phases where s_i = '0'.\n    # These 2^k0 - 1 teams will occupy skills 2^n, 2^n-1, ..., 2^n - (2^k0 - 2).\n    # So the winning team must have a skill of at most 2^n - (2^k0 - 1) = 2^n - 2^k0 + 1.\n    max_winning_skill = total_teams - (1 << k0) + 1\n\n    result = []\n    for x in range(min_winning_skill, max_winning_skill + 1):\n        result.append(str(x))\n\n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(result) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
