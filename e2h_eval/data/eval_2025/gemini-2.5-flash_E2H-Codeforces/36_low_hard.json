The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process for the \"Radio Towers\" problem. This seems like a fun one!**\n\nSo, the user wants me to tackle this competitive programming problem about setting up radio towers to cover towns. I see, we have these towns laid out in a line, with a probabilistic tower placement scenario. The core challenge is figuring out if we can *validly* assign signal powers to these towers, given specific restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to get a firm grasp on the problem's mechanics. We have `n+2` towns, and towers are only possible in the middle `n` towns. Each tower has a 50/50 chance of being built. If a tower exists, we can then pick its signal power.\n\nThe signal reach works via a radius. A tower at town *i* with power *p* covers a range around it, from *i-p+1* to *i+p-1*. I immediately notice the key constraints: Towns 0 and n+1 *cannot* be covered, and each of the middle towns (1 to n) must be covered by *exactly one* tower.\n\nOkay, let's break down those constraints further. To prevent a tower from covering town 0, a tower at town *i* with power *p* must have *i >= p*. Similarly, for town *n+1* not to be covered, we have *i+p <= n+1* or *p <= n+1-i*. Thus, the maximum power *p* for a tower at *i* is limited to the minimum of *i* and *n+1-i*.\n\nNow, the \"exactly one\" coverage condition is the heart of the problem. This means no overlapping coverage or missed towns in the range from 1 to *n*. Thinking about this, this constraint suggests we need to carefully coordinate the powers of each tower. I'm imagining some clever dynamic programming or recursion might be involved to manage this dependency, as tower power choices impact coverage decisions, and thus feasibility.\n\nThe goal, ultimately, is to compute the *probability* that a valid assignment of powers exists. So, this boils down to counting valid tower configurations and dividing by the total number of possible tower configurations (2^n). This modulo 998244353 business is just a standard precaution to handle large numbers.\n\nNext step: I'll now delve deeper into the implications of that \"exactly one\" constraint. This is where the real work begins!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that a valid assignment of signal powers exists, given a configuration of towers. A tower is built in town $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ with probability $1/2$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built.\nThe conditions for a valid assignment of signal powers are:\n1.  Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n    A tower at town $i$ with power $p$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c-i| < p$. This means $i-p+1 \\le c \\le i+p-1$.\n    To not cover town $0$: $i-p+1 > 0 \\implies p \\le i$.\n    To not cover town $n+1$: $i+p-1 < n+1 \\implies p \\le n+1-i$.\n    So, for any tower at $i$, its power $p$ must satisfy $1 \\le p \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\n2.  Towns $1, \\dots, n$ receive signal from exactly one tower each.\n\nConsider the towns $1, \\dots, n$. Each must be covered by exactly one tower.\nIf we have a tower at town $i$ with power $p$, it covers the interval $[i-p+1, i+p-1]$.\nFor the \"exactly one\" condition to hold, these intervals must partition the set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis means that for any two distinct towers at $i_1, i_2$ with powers $p_1, p_2$, their coverage intervals $[i_1-p_1+1, i_1+p_1-1]$ and $[i_2-p_2+1, i_2+p_2-1]$ must be disjoint.\nAlso, the union of all such intervals for towers in $S$ must be exactly $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of such a partition.\nSuppose we have towers at $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$ with powers $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$.\nTheir coverage intervals are $I_j = [i_j-p_j+1, i_j+p_j-1]$.\nFor these intervals to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$:\n-   The first interval must cover town $1$, so $i_1-p_1+1 = 1 \\implies p_1 = i_1$.\n-   The last interval must cover town $n$, so $i_k+p_k-1 = n \\implies p_k = n+1-i_k$.\n-   For any two adjacent towers $i_j, i_{j+1}$, their intervals must meet exactly: $i_j+p_j-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{j+1}$.\n    This implies $p_{j+1} = i_{j+1} - (i_j+p_j-1)$.\n\nCombining these with $p_j \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$:\n-   For $p_1=i_1$, the condition $p_1 \\le i_1$ is met. The condition $p_1 \\le n+1-i_1$ means $i_1 \\le n+1-i_1 \\implies 2i_1 \\le n+1$.\n-   For $p_k=n+1-i_k$, the condition $p_k \\le n+1-i_k$ is met. The condition $p_k \\le i_k$ means $n+1-i_k \\le i_k \\implies n+1 \\le 2i_k$.\n\nLet's re-examine the conditions $p_j = i_j$ for the first tower, $p_j = n+1-i_j$ for the last tower, and $p_{j+1} = i_{j+1} - (i_j+p_j-1)$ for adjacent towers.\nAlso, $p_j$ must be positive. This is always true if $i_j \\ge 1$ and $n+1-i_j \\ge 1$.\nThe structure of these intervals is that $i_j$ is the midpoint of the interval $[i_j-p_j+1, i_j+p_j-1]$.\n$p_j = i_j - (i_j-p_j+1) = (i_j+p_j-1) - i_j + 1$.\nLet $L_j = i_j-p_j+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_j-1$.\nThen $p_j = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$. This means $R_j-L_j+1$ must be an even number, so $R_j$ and $L_j$ must have different parities.\nAlso, $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$. This means $L_j+R_j$ must be an even number, so $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nThese two conditions ($L_j, R_j$ different parity AND $L_j, R_j$ same parity) contradict each other.\nThis implies that $i_j$ is not necessarily the midpoint of the interval with integer coordinates.\nThe problem states \"signal from a tower located in a town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches every city $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$\".\nThis means $i-p < c < i+p$. For integers, this is $i-p+1 \\le c \\le i+p-1$.\nThe length of this interval is $(i+p-1) - (i-p+1) + 1 = 2p-1$.\nThe center of this interval is indeed $i$.\nFor $L_j = i_j-p_j+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_j-1$, we have $R_j-L_j+1 = 2p_j-1$. This is always an odd number.\n$L_j+R_j = 2i_j-2$. This is always an even number.\nSo $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity. This is consistent.\nThe constraint $p_j \\le i_j$ means $2p_j-1 \\le 2i_j-1$.\nThe constraint $p_j \\le n+1-i_j$ means $2p_j-1 \\le 2(n+1-i_j)-1$.\n\nThe condition for a valid configuration of towers $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ is that there exist $p_1, \\dots, p_k$ such that:\n1.  $1 \\le p_j \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$ for all $j$.\n2.  The intervals $I_j = [i_j-p_j+1, i_j+p_j-1]$ form a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n    This means $I_1 = [1, R_1]$, $I_j = [L_j, R_j]$ for $1 < j < k$, and $I_k = [L_k, n]$, where $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$.\n    Also, $L_j = i_j-p_j+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_j-1$.\n    From $L_j = i_j-p_j+1 \\implies p_j = i_j-L_j+1$.\n    From $R_j = i_j+p_j-1 \\implies p_j = R_j-i_j+1$.\n    Thus $i_j-L_j+1 = R_j-i_j+1 \\implies 2i_j = L_j+R_j$.\n    This implies $i_j$ is the average of $L_j$ and $R_j$.\n    For the first interval, $L_1=1$, so $2i_1 = 1+R_1$.\n    For the last interval, $R_k=n$, so $2i_k = L_k+n$.\n    For adjacent intervals, $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$.\n    So, $2i_1 = 1+R_1$. $2i_2 = (R_1+1)+R_2$. $2i_3 = (R_2+1)+R_3$, etc.\n    In general, $2i_j = R_{j-1}+1+R_j$ (with $R_0=0$).\n    Also, $i_j$ must be an integer, so $R_j$ must have the same parity as $R_{j-1}+1$.\n    $R_0=0$ (even). $R_1$ must be odd. $R_2$ must be even. $R_3$ must be odd.\n    In general, $R_j$ must have parity opposite to $j$. (i.e. $R_j \\pmod 2 = (j+1) \\pmod 2$).\n    Since $R_k=n$, this implies $n \\pmod 2 = (k+1) \\pmod 2$.\n\nConsider the condition $p_j \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n$p_j = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$.\n$i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\nThe condition $p_j \\le i_j \\implies (R_j-L_j+1)/2 \\le (L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+1 \\le L_j+R_j \\implies 1 \\le 2L_j$. This is true since $L_j \\ge 1$.\nThe condition $p_j \\le n+1-i_j \\implies (R_j-L_j+1)/2 \\le n+1-(L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+1 \\le 2(n+1)-(L_j+R_j) \\implies R_j-L_j+1 \\le 2n+2-L_j-R_j \\implies 2R_j+1 \\le 2n+2$.\nThis means $R_j \\le n + 1/2$. Since $R_j$ is an integer, $R_j \\le n$. This is also true as $R_j \\le R_k = n$.\nSo, any set of towers $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ where $i_j = (R_{j-1}+1+R_j)/2$ for some sequence $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_k=n$ with $R_j$ having parity $(j+1) \\pmod 2$ is a valid configuration.\nThe set $S$ is uniquely determined by the sequence $R_1, \\dots, R_{k-1}$.\nThe towns $i_j$ must be exactly the towns where towers are built.\nSo, a configuration of towers is valid if and only if there exists a sequence $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_k=n$ such that $R_j$ and $j$ have different parities (i.e. $R_j \\pmod 2 = (j+1) \\pmod 2$), and the set of built towers is exactly $S = \\{(R_{j-1}+1+R_j)/2 \\mid j=1, \\dots, k\\}$.\nThis means that for each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, the town $i_j = (R_{j-1}+1+R_j)/2$ must have a tower, and all other towns $m \\notin S$ must not have a tower.\n\nLet $f(m)$ be the number of ways to partition the interval $[1, m]$ into valid sub-intervals.\n$f(0) = 1$ (empty partition).\nA partition of $[1, n]$ means choosing $R_1, \\dots, R_{k-1}$.\nThe first tower is at $i_1 = (1+R_1)/2$. $R_1$ must be odd.\nThe next tower is at $i_2 = (R_1+1+R_2)/2$. $R_2$ must be even.\nAnd so on.\nThe total number of towns is $n$. Each town $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ either has a tower or not. There are $2^n$ total configurations.\nWe need to sum $1/2^k$ for each valid configuration with $k$ towers.\n\nLet $dp[j]$ be the sum of probabilities for valid configurations of towers covering towns $1, \\dots, j$.\n$dp[0] = 1$.\n$dp[j] = \\sum_{prev\\_j < j} (\\text{probability of valid config for } [prev\\_j+1, j]) \\cdot dp[prev\\_j]$.\nThe interval $[prev\\_j+1, j]$ is covered by a single tower at $i = (prev\\_j+1+j)/2$.\nThis requires that $prev\\_j+1$ and $j$ have the same parity (so $i$ is an integer).\nThe tower at $i$ must be built, and no other towers in $(prev\\_j, j)$ should be built.\nThe length of this interval is $j-prev\\_j$.\nThe number of towns in $(prev\\_j, j)$ (excluding $i$) is $j-prev\\_j-1$.\nSo, the probability for this segment is $(1/2) \\cdot (1/2)^{j-prev\\_j-1} = (1/2)^{j-prev\\_j}$.\nThis is valid if $prev\\_j+1$ and $j$ have the same parity.\n$dp[j] = \\sum_{prev\\_j=0}^{j-1} dp[prev\\_j] \\cdot (1/2)^{j-prev\\_j}$ if $prev\\_j+1 \\equiv j \\pmod 2$.\nThis means $prev\\_j \\not\\equiv j \\pmod 2$.\n$dp[j] = \\sum_{prev\\_j=0, prev\\_j \\not\\equiv j \\pmod 2}^{j-1} dp[prev\\_j] \\cdot (1/2)^{j-prev\\_j}$.\n\nLet $inv2 = 2^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$dp[j] = \\sum_{prev\\_j=0, prev\\_j \\not\\equiv j \\pmod 2}^{j-1} dp[prev\\_j] \\cdot inv2^{j-prev\\_j}$.\n$dp[j] = inv2^j \\sum_{prev\\_j=0, prev\\_j \\not\\equiv j \\pmod 2}^{j-1} dp[prev\\_j] \\cdot 2^{prev\\_j}$.\n\nLet $S_0[x] = \\sum_{k=0, k \\text{ even}}^x dp[k] \\cdot 2^k$.\nLet $S_1[x] = \\sum_{k=0, k \\text{ odd}}^x dp[k] \\cdot 2^k$.\n\nIf $j$ is even: $prev\\_j$ must be odd.\n$dp[j] = inv2^j \\cdot S_1[j-1]$.\nIf $j$ is odd: $prev\\_j$ must be even.\n$dp[j] = inv2^j \\cdot S_0[j-1]$.\n\nBase case: $dp[0]=1$.\n$S_0[0] = dp[0] \\cdot 2^0 = 1$.\n$S_1[0] = 0$.\n\nFor $j=1$: $j$ is odd. $prev\\_j$ must be even.\n$dp[1] = inv2^1 \\cdot S_0[0] = inv2 \\cdot 1 = inv2$.\n$S_0[1] = S_0[0] = 1$.\n$S_1[1] = S_1[0] + dp[1] \\cdot 2^1 = 0 + inv2 \\cdot 2 = 1$.\n\nFor $j=2$: $j$ is even. $prev\\_j$ must be odd.\n$dp[2] = inv2^2 \\cdot S_1[1] = inv2^2 \\cdot 1 = inv2^2$.\n$S_0[2] = S_0[1] + dp[2] \\cdot 2^2 = 1 + inv2^2 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n$S_1[2] = S_1[1] = 1$.\n\nFor $j=3$: $j$ is odd. $prev\\_j$ must be even.\n$dp[3] = inv2^3 \\cdot S_0[2] = inv2^3 \\cdot 2$.\n$S_0[3] = S_0[2] = 2$.\n$S_1[3] = S_1[2] + dp[3] \\cdot 2^3 = 1 + inv2^3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFor $j=4$: $j$ is even. $prev\\_j$ must be odd.\n$dp[4] = inv2^4 \\cdot S_1[3] = inv2^4 \\cdot 3$.\n$S_0[4] = S_0[3] + dp[4] \\cdot 2^4 = 2 + inv2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 16 = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n$S_1[4] = S_1[3] = 3$.\n\nIt appears $S_0[j]$ for even $j$ are Fibonacci numbers $F_{j+2}$ (where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$).\n$S_0[0] = 1 = F_2$.\n$S_0[2] = 2 = F_3$.\n$S_0[4] = 5 = F_5$.\n$S_0[j]$ for even $j$ is $F_{j+2}$.\nAnd $S_1[j]$ for odd $j$ are Fibonacci numbers $F_{j+1}$.\n$S_1[1] = 1 = F_2$.\n$S_1[3] = 3 = F_4$.\n$S_1[j]$ for odd $j$ is $F_{j+1}$.\n\nSo, for $j$ even, $dp[j] = inv2^j \\cdot S_1[j-1] = inv2^j \\cdot F_{(j-1)+1} = inv2^j \\cdot F_j$.\nFor $j$ odd, $dp[j] = inv2^j \\cdot S_0[j-1] = inv2^j \\cdot F_{(j-1)+2} = inv2^j \\cdot F_{j+1}$.\n\nThe final answer is $dp[n]$.\nIf $n$ is even, answer is $inv2^n \\cdot F_n$.\nIf $n$ is odd, answer is $inv2^n \\cdot F_{n+1}$.\n\nWe need to compute Fibonacci numbers modulo $998244353$.\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\nLet's check the examples.\n$n=2$: $n$ is even. Answer $dp[2] = inv2^2 \\cdot F_2 = (1/4) \\cdot 1 = 1/4$.\n$1/4 \\pmod{998244353} = 249561089$.\nWait, example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$.\n$1/4 = 0.25$.\n$748683265 / 998244353 = 0.75$. This is $3/4$.\nWhat went wrong?\n\nThe problem states: \"you will have a way to set signal powers\". This means *at least one* way.\nMy $dp$ formulation sums the probabilities of each *specific* valid configuration.\nFor a given set of built towers $S$, there is either 0 or 1 way to set signal powers.\nMy $dp[n]$ is the sum of probabilities of all valid configurations. This is exactly what is asked.\n\nLet's re-check the $n=2$ example.\nPossible tower configurations for $n=2$:\n1.  No towers (00): $S=\\emptyset$. Not valid (towns 1,2 not covered). Prob $1/4$.\n2.  Tower at 1 only (10): $S=\\{1\\}$. $i_1=1$. $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. Town 2 not covered. Not valid. Prob $1/4$.\n3.  Tower at 2 only (01): $S=\\{2\\}$. $i_1=2$. $p_1=1$. Covers $[2,2]$. Town 1 not covered. Not valid. Prob $1/4$.\n4.  Towers at 1 and 2 (11): $S=\\{1,2\\}$.\n    We need to partition $[1,2]$.\n    Option A: one tower covers $[1,2]$. $i_1=(1+2)/2=1.5$. Not an integer. Not possible.\n    Option B: two towers. $i_1$ covers $[1, R_1]$, $i_2$ covers $[L_2, 2]$. $R_1=L_2-1$.\n    $R_1$ must be odd. $R_1=1$. So $L_2=2$.\n    $i_1=(1+1)/2=1$. $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$.\n    $i_2=(2+2)/2=2$. $p_2=1$. Covers $[2,2]$.\n    This is a valid configuration. $S=\\{1,2\\}$. Probability $1/4$.\n    This is the only valid configuration for $n=2$.\n    So the answer for $n=2$ is $1/4$. My formula gives $1/4$.\n    The example output $748683265$ is $3/4$.\n    This implies my interpretation of \"valid configuration\" or \"probability\" is wrong.\n\nLet's re-read the example for $n=2$: \"with probability $1/4$, the towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\" This is exactly what I found. The example output is $3/4$.\n\nWhat if $n=1$?\nTowns $0,1,2$. Tower at town $1$ with probability $1/2$.\n1.  No tower at 1 (0): $S=\\emptyset$. Not valid. Prob $1/2$.\n2.  Tower at 1 (1): $S=\\{1\\}$. $i_1=1$.\n    To cover $[1,1]$: $p_1=1$. $L_1=1, R_1=1$. $i_1=(1+1)/2=1$. This is valid. Prob $1/2$.\n    My formula: $n=1$ is odd. $dp[1] = inv2^1 \\cdot F_{1+1} = inv2 \\cdot F_2 = inv2 \\cdot 1 = 1/2$.\n    Example output for $n=1$ is $748683265$, which is $3/4$.\n\nThis suggests my $dp[n]$ is not the final answer.\nThe problem statement: \"Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\"\nThis is the probability that $S$ is a \"valid configuration set\".\n\nLet's check the $n=3$ example.\n$n=3$ is odd. My formula: $dp[3] = inv2^3 \\cdot F_{3+1} = inv2^3 \\cdot F_4 = (1/8) \\cdot 3 = 3/8$.\nExample output for $n=3$ is $748683265$, which is $3/4$.\n\nThis is very strange. My calculated probabilities are $1/2$ for $n=1$, $1/4$ for $n=2$, $3/8$ for $n=3$.\nThe example outputs are $3/4$ for $n=1,2,3$.\nThis means my solution is systematically off for small $N$.\nCould it be that the Fibonacci sequence definition is $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, \\dots$? No, usually $F_0=0, F_1=1$. The problem text uses $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$. So my current sequence is correct.\n\nLet's revisit the definition of $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\n$L_j = i_j-p_j+1$, $R_j = i_j+p_j-1$.\nThe $p_j$ must be integers.\n$p_j = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$. Since $p_j$ is an integer, $R_j-L_j+1$ must be even.\nThis means $R_j$ and $L_j$ must have different parities.\nBut $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$. Since $i_j$ is an integer, $L_j+R_j$ must be even.\nThis means $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nThis is a contradiction! $L_j$ and $R_j$ cannot have both same and different parities.\n\nThis means my understanding of the problem statement \"signal from a tower located in a town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches every city $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$\" is wrong.\nLet's check this again: $|c-i|<p$.\nIf $p=1$, $|c-i|<1 \\implies c=i$. So a tower at $i$ with power $1$ covers *only* town $i$.\nIf $p=2$, $|c-i|<2 \\implies -2 < c-i < 2 \\implies i-2 < c < i+2 \\implies c \\in \\{i-1, i, i+1\\}$.\nSo a tower at $i$ with power $p$ covers towns $[i-p+1, i+p-1]$. This is what I used.\nThe length of this interval is $2p-1$.\nThe center is $i$.\nFor $p_j$ to be an integer, $2p_j-1$ must be an odd number.\nThe interval $[L_j, R_j]$ must have an odd length $R_j-L_j+1$.\nThis implies $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nAlso, $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$. For $i_j$ to be an integer, $L_j+R_j$ must be even. This also implies $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nThis is consistent. My previous reasoning about contradiction was flawed. $R_j-L_j+1$ being odd implies $R_j, L_j$ have the same parity. $L_j+R_j$ being even implies $R_j, L_j$ have the same parity. No contradiction.\n\nSo, the conditions for a valid partition:\n1.  $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_k=n$.\n2.  For each $j$, $R_j$ and $R_{j-1}+1$ must have the same parity (so that $i_j=(R_{j-1}+1+R_j)/2$ is an integer).\n    This implies $R_j \\equiv R_{j-1}+1 \\pmod 2$.\n    $R_0=0$ (even).\n    $R_1 \\equiv R_0+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ (odd).\n    $R_2 \\equiv R_1+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ (even).\n    $R_3 \\equiv R_2+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ (odd).\n    So $R_j$ must have parity $j \\pmod 2$.\n    This means $n$ must have parity $k \\pmod 2$.\n\nThe set of towers $S = \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ where $i_j=(R_{j-1}+1+R_j)/2$.\nFor a configuration to be valid, it must be exactly this set $S$.\nThe probability of this specific configuration is $(1/2)^k \\cdot (1/2)^{n-k} = (1/2)^n$.\nThis is the key. The probability is $(1/2)^n$ for *any* valid configuration, regardless of $k$.\nThis is because for a valid configuration, $k$ towers must be built, and $n-k$ towns must *not* have towers. All these $n$ events are independent, each with probability $1/2$. So the probability of *any specific* valid configuration is $(1/2)^n$.\n\nThe total probability is $(1/2)^n \\times (\\text{number of valid configurations})$.\nSo we need to count the number of valid sequences $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_k=n$ such that $R_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$.\nLet $N(m)$ be the number of such sequences ending at $m$.\n$N(0)=1$ (empty sequence $R_0=0$).\nTo form a sequence ending at $j$: $R_k=j$.\nThe previous element $R_{k-1}$ must be $0 \\le R_{k-1} < j$.\nAlso $R_k \\equiv k \\pmod 2$ and $R_{k-1} \\equiv (k-1) \\pmod 2$.\nSo $j \\equiv k \\pmod 2$ and $R_{k-1} \\not\\equiv k \\pmod 2$.\nThis means $R_{k-1}$ must have different parity than $j$.\n$N(j) = \\sum_{prev\\_j=0, prev\\_j \\not\\equiv j \\pmod 2}^{j-1} N(prev\\_j)$.\n\nLet $N_0[x] = \\sum_{k=0, k \\text{ even}}^x N(k)$.\nLet $N_1[x] = \\sum_{k=0, k \\text{ odd}}^x N(k)$.\n\nIf $j$ is even: $prev\\_j$ must be odd.\n$N(j) = N_1[j-1]$.\nIf $j$ is odd: $prev\\_j$ must be even.\n$N(j) = N_0[j-1]$.\n\nBase case: $N(0)=1$.\n$N_0[0] = N(0) = 1$.\n$N_1[0] = 0$.\n\nFor $j=1$: $j$ is odd.\n$N(1) = N_0[0] = 1$.\n$N_0[1] = N_0[0] = 1$.\n$N_1[1] = N_1[0] + N(1) = 0 + 1 = 1$.\n\nFor $j=2$: $j$ is even.\n$N(2) = N_1[1] = 1$.\n$N_0[2] = N_0[1] + N(2) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n$N_1[2] = N_1[1] = 1$.\n\nFor $j=3$: $j$ is odd.\n$N(3) = N_0[2] = 2$.\n$N_0[3] = N_0[2] = 2$.\n$N_1[3] = N_1[2] + N(3) = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFor $j=4$: $j$ is even.\n$N(4) = N_1[3] = 3$.\n$N_0[4] = N_0[3] + N(4) = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n$N_1[4] = N_1[3] = 3$.\n\nThis sequence $N(j)$ is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$.\n$N(0)=1$.\n$N(1)=1$.\n$N(j)$ for $j \\ge 2$ follows Fibonacci sequence: $N(j) = F_{j-1}$ where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nNo, this is not quite right.\n$N(0)=1$.\n$N(1)=1$.\n$N(2)=1$.\n$N(3)=2$.\n$N(4)=3$.\n$N(5)=5$.\nThis means $N(j) = F_{j+1}$ for $j \\ge 1$.\nAnd $N(0)=1$.\nSo, the number of valid configurations is $N(n)$.\nFor $n=1$, $N(1)=1$.\nFor $n=2$, $N(2)=1$.\nFor $n=3$, $N(3)=2$.\nFor $n=4$, $N(4)=3$.\nFor $n=5$, $N(5)=5$.\n\nThe total probability is $N(n) \\cdot inv2^n$.\nFor $n=1$: $1 \\cdot inv2^1 = 1/2$. Still not $3/4$.\nFor $n=2$: $1 \\cdot inv2^2 = 1/4$. Still not $3/4$.\nFor $n=3$: $2 \\cdot inv2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. Still not $3/4$.\n\nThis is very confusing. The example outputs for $n=1,2,3$ are all $3/4$.\nWhat could possibly give $3/4$?\n$1 - 1/4 = 3/4$.\n$1 - (1/2)^2 = 3/4$.\n$1 - (1/2)^n$ for $n=2$ gives $3/4$.\nWhat if $n=1$? $1 - (1/2)^1 = 1/2$. Not $3/4$.\n\nLet's re-read the problem very carefully.\n\"towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal from the radio towers\"\n\"towns $1, 2, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\"\n\nThe example for $n=5$: towers in $2,4,5$.\nTown 2 power 2: covers $[2-2+1, 2+2-1] = [1,3]$.\nTown 4 power 1: covers $[4,4]$.\nTown 5 power 1: covers $[5,5]$.\nUnion of covered towns: $[1,3] \\cup [4,4] \\cup [5,5] = [1,5]$.\nTowns $0, n+1=6$ are not covered.\nThis is a valid configuration.\nThe towers are at $i_1=2, i_2=4, i_3=5$.\n$R_0=0$.\n$i_1=2$. It covers $[1,3]$. So $L_1=1, R_1=3$.\n$i_1 = (1+3)/2 = 2$. $R_1=3$ (odd), $R_0=0$ (even). $R_1 \\not\\equiv R_0 \\pmod 2$. This is $R_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$. $R_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Yes.\n$i_2=4$. It covers $[4,4]$. So $L_2=4, R_2=4$.\n$i_2 = (4+4)/2 = 4$. $R_2=4$ (even), $R_1=3$ (odd). $R_2 \\not\\equiv R_1 \\pmod 2$. This is $R_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$. $R_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 2$. Yes.\n$i_3=5$. It covers $[5,5]$. So $L_3=5, R_3=5$.\n$i_3 = (5+5)/2 = 5$. $R_3=5$ (odd), $R_2=4$ (even). $R_3 \\not\\equiv R_2 \\pmod 2$. This is $R_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$. $R_3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 2$. Yes.\nThis configuration corresponds to $R_0=0, R_1=3, R_2=4, R_3=5=n$.\nThe towns where towers are built are exactly $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$.\nThis is a valid configuration according to my current model.\nThe number of towns $k=3$. The probability of this *specific* configuration is $(1/2)^n = (1/2)^5 = 1/32$.\nMy $N(5)$ should be $F_{5+1} = F_6 = 8$.\nSo for $n=5$, my answer is $8 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 8/32 = 1/4$.\nExample output for $n=5$ is $842268673$. This is $5/32$.\nMy formula gets $1/4$, example gets $5/32$. This is $8/32$ vs $5/32$.\nThis means my counting of valid configurations $N(n)$ is off.\n\nLet's look at $n=5$ example.\n$S=\\{2,4,5\\}$. $R=(0,3,4,5)$.\n$p_1=i_1-L_1+1 = 2-1+1=2$. $p_1 \\le \\min(i_1, n+1-i_1) = \\min(2, 6-2) = \\min(2,4)=2$. Valid.\n$p_2=i_2-L_2+1 = 4-4+1=1$. $p_2 \\le \\min(i_2, n+1-i_2) = \\min(4, 6-4) = \\min(4,2)=2$. Valid.\n$p_3=i_3-L_3+1 = 5-5+1=1$. $p_3 \\le \\min(i_3, n+1-i_3) = \\min(5, 6-5) = \\min(5,1)=1$. Valid.\nThis is a valid configuration.\n\nThe only condition I might have missed is that the towns $1, \\dots, n$ must get signal from exactly one tower.\nThe intervals must be $I_j = [i_j-p_j+1, i_j+p_j-1]$.\nThe previous logic that $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ and $p_j=(R_j-L_j+1)/2$ implies that $p_j$ is uniquely determined by $L_j, R_j$.\nAnd $i_j$ is uniquely determined by $L_j, R_j$.\nAnd $L_j, R_j$ are determined by the sequence $R_0, \\dots, R_k$.\nSo, for a given sequence $R_0, \\dots, R_k$, the set of towers $S$ and their powers $p_j$ are uniquely determined.\nAnd the conditions $p_j \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$ were shown to be always satisfied.\nSo, a configuration is valid if and only if the set of built towers is exactly $S = \\{(R_{j-1}+1+R_j)/2 \\mid j=1, \\dots, k\\}$ for some sequence $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_k=n$ with $R_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$.\nThe number of such sequences is $N(n)$.\nThe probability is $N(n) \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. What if the example output values are actually Fibonacci-related?\n$n=1: 3/4$.\n$n=2: 3/4$.\n$n=3: 3/4$.\n$n=5: 5/32$.\nThe $5/32$ for $n=5$ is $F_5 \\cdot (1/2)^5$. This matches my *initial* incorrect $dp[j]$ for $j$ even.\n$F_5=5$. $5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$.\nWhat if the answer is $F_{n_{eff}} \\cdot (1/2)^n$? But $n_{eff}$ depends on parity.\nFor $n=1$, $F_1=1$. $1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1/2$.\nFor $n=2$, $F_2=1$. $1 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\nFor $n=3$, $F_3=2$. $2 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 1/4$.\n\nThe example outputs are:\n$n=1: 3/4$.\n$n=2: 3/4$.\n$n=3: 3/4$.\n$n=5: 5/32$.\n\nThis is very strange. The example output for $n=1,2,3$ is $3/4$. This is $1 - (1/2)^2$.\nThis means for $n=1$, $3/4$ is correct. My $1/2$ is wrong.\nFor $n=2$, $3/4$ is correct. My $1/4$ is wrong.\nFor $n=3$, $3/4$ is correct. My $1/4$ is wrong.\nFor $n=5$, $5/32$ is correct. My $1/4$ is wrong.\nWhat is the pattern?\n$n=1$: $3/4$\n$n=2$: $3/4$\n$n=3$: $3/4$\n$n=4$: ? (not in examples)\n$n=5$: $5/32$\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is usually $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\nThe solution might involve a modified Fibonacci sequence, or a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet's assume the example outputs are correct and try to find a pattern.\n$n=1$: Output $3/4$.\n$n=2$: Output $3/4$.\n$n=3$: Output $3/4$.\n$n=4$: My formula $N(4) \\cdot (1/2)^4 = 3 \\cdot (1/16) = 3/16$.\n$n=5$: Output $5/32$. My formula $N(5) \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5 \\cdot (1/32) = 5/32$. This matches!\n\nSo my current $N(n) \\cdot (1/2)^n$ formula for $n=5$ is correct.\nWhy is it wrong for $n=1,2,3$?\n$N(n)$ is number of valid sequences $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_k=n$ where $R_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$.\n$N(0)=1$.\n$N(1)=1$.\n$N(2)=1$.\n$N(3)=2$.\n$N(4)=3$.\n$N(5)=5$.\nSo, $N(n)$ values are $1,1,1,2,3,5,\\dots$.\nThis is $F_{n}$ for $n \\ge 2$, and $F_1=1$ for $n=1$, $F_2=1$ for $n=2$.\nMore accurately, $N(n) = F_n$ for $n \\ge 2$, and $N(1)=F_1=1$.\n$N(0)=1$ is a special case.\nSo the number of valid configurations is $F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$ if we define $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nLet's use the standard $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThen $N(n) = F_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n$N(1)=F_2=1$.\n$N(2)=F_3=2$.

This is where my previous $N(2)=1$ was wrong. $N(2)$ should be $2$.\nMy previous $N(2)$ was $N_1[1]=1$. $N_1[1]$ is $\\sum_{k=0, k \\text{ odd}}^1 N(k) = N(1)=1$. Correct.\n$N(2)=N_1[1]=1$. This is correct.

The example output is $3/4$ for all of them.\nThis is highly suspicious. Could it be a special case for small $N$?\nMaybe for $n \\le 3$, the answer is $3/4$? And for $n \\ge 4$, it follows $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$?\nLet's check $n=4$ with this hypothesis. $F_4=3$. So answer for $n=4$ would be $3 \\cdot (1/2)^4 = 3/16$.\n\nThis is a very common trick in competitive programming. Small $N$ values are edge cases.\nWhy would $n=1,2,3$ be $3/4$?\nFor $n=1$:\n-   No tower: $00$. Invalid. Prob $1/2$.\n-   Tower at 1: $10$. Valid. Prob $1/2$.\nTotal $1/2$.\nHow can it be $3/4$? This implies some other configuration is valid.\nWhat if $n=1$, we build a tower at town $1$, and set its power to $p=1$. It covers town $1$.\nTown $0$ is not covered ($|0-1|<1$ is false). Town $2$ is not covered ($|2-1|<1$ is false).\nThis is a valid setting. Probability $1/2$.\n\nThe only way to get $3/4$ for $n=1$ is if \"no tower\" is also valid, or some other options.\nBut \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\" means $S \\ne \\emptyset$.\nIf $n=1$, and town $1$ has no tower, it doesn't get signal. So it's not valid.\nSo my $1/2$ for $n=1$ seems correct.\n\nWhat if the problem implies that $n+2$ towns are $0, \\dots, n+1$.\nAnd towers are built in towns $1, \\dots, n$.\nThe signal from a tower at $i$ with power $p$ reaches $c$ such that $|c-i|<p$.\nTowns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.\nTowns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one tower each.\n\nCould it be that the problem is saying that towns $0$ and $n+1$ are special, and towns $1, \\dots, n$ are the *only* places where towers can be built?\nThe problem statement is clear: \"You build a radio tower in each of the towns $1, 2, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$\".\nThis implies $2^n$ possible configurations.\n\nThe only way my derived $N(n)$ is wrong, is if my conditions for $R_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$ or $p_j \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$ are wrong.\nI re-verified the parity conditions and the bounds on $p_j$. They seem correct.\nThe problem statement is very precise.\n\nIs there any ambiguity in \"exactly one radio tower each\"?\nIf town $c$ is covered by tower $A$ and tower $B$, it's invalid.\nIf town $c$ is not covered by any tower, it's invalid.\nMy partition approach handles this exactly.\n\nMaybe the issue is with $n=1,2,3$ and $n \\ge 4$ is a different formula.\nLet's consider the constraints on $p$. $1 \\le p \\le n$.\nMy $p_j = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$.\n$L_j \\ge 1$. $R_j \\le n$.\nSo $p_j = (R_j-L_j+1)/2 \\ge (1-n+1)/2$ which can be negative for large $n$.\nNo, $L_j \\le R_j$. So $R_j-L_j+1 \\ge 1$. So $p_j \\ge 1/2$. Since $p_j$ must be integer, $p_j \\ge 1$. This is okay.\n$p_j = (R_j-L_j+1)/2 \\le (n-1+1)/2 = n/2$.\nSo $p_j$ will always be $\\le n/2$. This satisfies $p_j \\le n$.\n\nWhat if $n=0$? Not allowed, $n \\ge 1$.\n\nLet's check the example $n=5$. Output $5/32$. My calculation $F_5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5/32$. This matches.\nSo my formula $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$ for $n \\ge 5$ is likely correct.\nThe issue is with $n=1,2,3$.\nMaybe the problem has a hardcoded answer for small $N$?\nThis is unusual for competitive programming. Usually, there is one unified logic.\n\nIs there any difference between $n=1,2,3$ and $n \\ge 4$?\nFor $n=1,2,3$, my formula gives $1/2, 1/4, 1/4$.\nThe example output $3/4$ for all of them.\nFor $n=4$: $F_4=3$. My formula gives $3 \\cdot (1/2)^4 = 3/16$.\n$3/16 \\approx 0.1875$. This is not $3/4$.\n\nConsider $N=1$.\nTowers in $\\{1\\}$.\nPossible configurations:\n- $S = \\emptyset$. Prob $1/2$. Invalid (town 1 not covered).\n- $S = \\{1\\}$. Prob $1/2$. Valid (power $p_1=1$ covers town 1).\nTotal prob is $1/2$.\nThe example says $3/4$. This is very strange.\nIt's possible the example outputs are for a different problem, or there's a misunderstanding of the problem text.\nHowever, for $n=5$, my answer matches. So my interpretation might be correct for larger $N$.\n\nWhat if the towns $0$ and $n+1$ being \"not covered\" has some specific impact for small $N$?\nFor $n=1$: Town $0$ and $2$ must not be covered. Tower at $1$ with power $p$.\n$p \\le \\min(1, 1+1-1) = \\min(1,1)=1$. So $p=1$.\nTower at $1$ with power $1$ covers $c$ such that $|c-1|<1 \\implies c=1$.\nTown $0$ is not covered. Town $2$ is not covered. Town $1$ is covered by exactly one.\nThis is exactly my reasoning.\n\nCould it be that the problem statement $F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$ means $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, \\dots$?\nIf $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, F_5=8, \\dots$.\nThen $N(j)$ would be $F_{j+1}$ from this sequence.\n$N(1)=F_2=2$.\n$N(2)=F_3=3$.\n$N(3)=F_4=5$.\n$N(5)=F_6=8$.\nThen for $n=1$: $2 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1$.\nFor $n=2$: $3 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 3/4$. This matches for $n=2$!\nFor $n=3$: $5 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 5/8$. (Does not match $3/4$)\nFor $n=5$: $8 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 8/32 = 1/4$. (Does not match $5/32$)\n\nThis means the Fibonacci sequence $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$ is the correct one.\nMy logic for $N(n)=F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$ (and $N(0)=1$) is correct.\nThe only remaining possibility is that the example outputs for $n=1,2,3$ are simply wrong or refer to something else.\nOr there's a problem-specific special handling for $n=1,2,3$.\nGiven $n=5$ example matches, I will trust my general formula $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nThe $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$ definition is standard.\nSo $N(n)=F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n$F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$.\nProbabilities:\n$n=1: F_1 \\cdot (1/2)^1 = 1 \\cdot 1/2 = 1/2$.\n$n=2: F_2 \\cdot (1/2)^2 = 1 \\cdot 1/4 = 1/4$.\n$n=3: F_3 \\cdot (1/2)^3 = 2 \\cdot 1/8 = 1/4$.\n$n=4: F_4 \\cdot (1/2)^4 = 3 \\cdot 1/16 = 3/16$.\n$n=5: F_5 \\cdot (1/2)^5 = 5 \\cdot 1/32 = 5/32$. This matches the example.\n\nMy final hypothesis: The problem statement says \"The real answer for the first example is $1/4$\".\nThe input is `2`. So for $n=2$, the answer is $1/4$. This matches my formula.\nThe input is `3`. So for $n=3$, the answer is $1/4$. This matches my formula.\nThe input is `5`. So for $n=5$, the answer is $5/32$. This matches my formula.\nThe first line of example output is `748683265`. This is $3/4$.\nThe second line of example output is `748683265`. This is $3/4$.\nThe third line of example output is `842268673`. This is $5/32$.\nThe example inputs are `2`, `3`, `5`, `200000`.\nSo the example outputs correspond to $n=2, n=3, n=5, n=200000$.\nThe problem text says \"The real answer for the first example is $1/4$\". But the first line of output is $3/4$.\nThis is a clear contradiction between the example text and the example output.\nI will trust the example text which states $1/4$ for $n=2$, $1/4$ for $n=3$, and $5/32$ for $n=5$.\nMy formula $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n$ (with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$) matches these \"real answers\".\nSo the code should calculate $F_n \\cdot (1/2)^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.  Calculate $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$.\n    Use matrix exponentiation for $F_n$ for large $n$, or simple iteration for $n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n    Since $n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, iteration is fine.\n2.  Calculate $inv2^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\n    $inv2 = 2^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$. $inv2 = (998244353+1)/2 = 499122177$.\n    Use modular exponentiation for $inv2^n$.\n3.  Multiply $F_n \\cdot inv2^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nModular arithmetic:\nMOD = 998244353.\n$inv2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)$.\n\nFibonacci sequence calculation:\n$F_0=0, F_1=1$.\n$F_i = (F_{i-1} + F_{i-2}) \\pmod{MOD}$.\nWe need $F_n$.\nIf $n=0$, $F_0=0$. But $n \\ge 1$.\nSo we need to compute $F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n == 0: # n >= 1 constraint, but for completeness\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Calculate F_n modulo MOD\n    # F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, ...\n    if n == 1:\n        fib_n = 1\n    else:\n        f = [0] * (n + 1)\n        f[0] = 0\n        f[1] = 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            f[i] = (f[i-1] + f[i-2]) % MOD\n        fib_n = f[n]\n    \n    # Calculate (1/2)^n mod MOD\n    inv2 = pow(2, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    inv2_pow_n = pow(inv2, n, MOD)\n    \n    # Result is F_n * (1/2)^n mod MOD\n    ans = (fib_n * inv2_pow_n) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
