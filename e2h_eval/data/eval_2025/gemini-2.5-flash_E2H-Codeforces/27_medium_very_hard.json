    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on \"A Twisty Movement\"**\n\nOkay, so we've got this competitive programming problem called \"A Twisty Movement.\" Seems straightforward at first glance: a sequence of 1s and 2s, and we want to reverse a portion of it to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS).  The input size is capped at 2000, which means an O(N^3) solution could be too slow, and O(N^2) would be ideal.  It's a classic problem where we need to find a way to avoid brute-forcing the reversal and LNDS calculation.\n\n**Understanding the Core Challenge**\n\nThe key insight here is how to efficiently calculate the LNDS.  Since the sequence contains only 1s and 2s, the non-decreasing subsequence is essentially a \"staircase\" of 1s followed by 2s. We need to find the best \"split point\" – the index where we transition from 1s to 2s.  Pre-computing counts of 1s and 2s using prefix and suffix sums seems like a good starting point.  We can iterate through all possible segments `[l, r]` and then find the best split point within the *reversed* segment to determine the LNDS.\n\n**Developing the O(N^2) Approach**\n\nThe initial idea of brute-forcing the reversals and LNDS calculations will be too slow, so a smarter algorithm is needed. The aim is to find a way to precompute some data and avoid repeatedly calculating the LNDS for each possible segment. I need to figure out how to efficiently determine the maximum LNDS after each possible reversal. The main thought is that we fix the `[l,r]` range, reverse it, then try all possible split points within and without the reversed range. If we consider `P_1[i]` as the count of 1s up to index `i` (inclusive), and `S_2[i]` as count of 2s from index `i` onward (inclusive), we would want to iterate through all possible split points after reversal, and maximize `P_1[l-1] + c_1(l-1,k-1) + c_2(k,r-1) + S_2[r]`.\n\nThe key is to use the count of 1s (and 2s) from original sequence.\n\nFor each `l` and `r` pair, we have a fixed sequence *b* that is our original sequence with a segment reversed. We iterate through each possible split point `k`. The LNDS calculation reduces to, for each `l` and `r`: `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count_1s_in_b[0...k-1] + count_2s_in_b[k...n-1])`.\n\nThe goal is to simplify this calculation so that we can precompute a set of prefix and suffix arrays. For any `[l, r]` segment and any `k`, the counts of 1s and 2s could then be computed in O(1) by accessing precomputed values. The expression becomes: `P_1[l-1] + c_1(l-1, k-1) + c_2(k, r-1) + S_2[r]` to calculate the count of LNDS.\n\n**Refining the Algorithm and Optimizing for Speed**\n\nFocusing on optimizing for speed, the goal now becomes: compute a max value, for `l` from `0` to `n` and `r` from `0` to `n`. In other words we need a function to compute for any range `l` and `r`. And we need a quick way to find the `LNDS = max_{k}[count(1s_before_segment, count(1s in b[0..k-1) + count(2s_in b[k..n-1])]`. We want to avoid O(N^3) and arrive at `O(N^2)`.\nIterating k from `l` to `r`, and then `l` and `r` would make O(N^3).\n\nSo we need to see how to optimize that. If the `r` value increases, the number of 1s/2s from the prefix/suffix doesn't change, we only need to account the number of reversed elements.\n```\nFor l=0:\nk=0 to r\nFor l=1:\nk=0 to r\n```\n\nThe range `l...r` increases. So we can move this to O(N^2)\n\nI think I see it - precomputing the",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a single contiguous subsegment `a[l...r]` of the given sequence `a`. The sequence `a` consists only of 1s and 2s.\n\n**Key Observation for LNDS with 1s and 2s:**\nA non-decreasing subsequence consisting only of 1s and 2s must be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. To maximize its length, we should pick as many 1s as possible, followed by as many 2s as possible. This means we are looking for a split point `k` (0-indexed, `0 <= k <= n`). All 1s for the LNDS are chosen from `b[0...k-1]` and all 2s are chosen from `b[k...n-1]`, where `b` is the modified sequence. The length of such an LNDS would be `(count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`. We need to maximize this value over all possible `k` and all possible `[l, r]` reversals.\n\n**Analyzing the Effect of Reversal:**\nLet the original sequence be `a`. We choose an interval `[l, r]` (1-indexed) to reverse. Let `l_0 = l-1` and `r_0 = r-1` be the 0-indexed boundaries.\nThe new sequence `b` is formed by:\n1. `a[0...l_0-1]` (prefix, unchanged)\n2. `reversed(a[l_0...r_0])` (the reversed segment)\n3. `a[r_0+1...n-1]` (suffix, unchanged)\n\nLet's consider a split point `k` (0-indexed) in the *modified* sequence `b`.\nThe count of 1s in `b[0...k-1]` is the total number of 1s in the elements `b[0], ..., b[k-1]`.\nThe count of 2s in `b[k...n-1]` is the total number of 2s in the elements `b[k], ..., b[n-1]`.\n\nCrucially, reversing a segment only changes the *order* of elements within that segment; it does not change the *total count* of 1s or 2s within the segment.\nTherefore, the total count of 1s in `b[0...k-1]` is exactly the same as the total count of 1s in `a[0...k-1]`.\nSimilarly, the total count of 2s in `b[k...n-1]` is exactly the same as the total count of 2s in `a[k...n-1]`.\n\nThis simplifies the problem immensely! The LNDS of the modified sequence `b` is simply:\n`max_{0 <= k <= n} (count of 1s in a[0...k-1] + count of 2s in a[k...n-1])`.\n\nWait, this is incorrect. This statement would imply that reversing a segment has no effect on the LNDS, which contradicts the example where reversing `[2,3]` in `[1,2,1,2]` changes the LNDS from 3 to 4.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the LNDS definition for `b`.\nThe LNDS of `b` is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count_1s_in_b[0...k-1] + count_2s_in_b[k...n-1])`.\nHere, `count_1s_in_b[0...k-1]` means we take 1s from `b[0]` up to `b[k-1]`.\n`count_2s_in_b[k...n-1]` means we take 2s from `b[k]` up to `b[n-1]`.\n\nThe key insight is that *we can choose the `k` for the LNDS calculation to be anywhere, even inside the reversed segment*.\nLet `P1[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]` (prefix sum of 1s). `P1[0]=0`.\nLet `P2[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]` (prefix sum of 2s). `P2[0]=0`.\n\nFor a fixed `l_0, r_0` (0-indexed interval to reverse):\nThe LNDS of the modified array `b` will be:\n`max_{0 <= k <= n} ( (number of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (number of 2s in b[k...n-1]) )`\n\nLet's break down the calculation for `(number of 1s in b[0...k-1])` and `(number of 2s in b[k...n-1])` based on where `k` falls:\n\n**Case 1: `k <= l_0` (split point before the reversed segment)**\nThe elements `b[0...k-1]` are identical to `a[0...k-1]`.\nThe elements `b[k...n-1]` are `a[k...l_0-1]`, then `reversed(a[l_0...r_0])`, then `a[r_0+1...n-1]`.\nNumber of 1s in `b[0...k-1]` = `P1[k]`.\nNumber of 2s in `b[k...n-1]` = `(P2[l_0] - P2[k])` (from `a[k...l_0-1]`)\n                                + `(P2[r_0+1] - P2[l_0])` (from `a[l_0...r_0]`, which is reversed but counts of 2s are same)\n                                + `(P2[n] - P2[r_0+1])` (from `a[r_0+1...n-1]`)\n                                = `P2[n] - P2[k]`.\nSo, for `k <= l_0`, the LNDS contribution is `P1[k] + (P2[n] - P2[k])`.\n\n**Case 2: `k > r_0` (split point after the reversed segment)**\nThe elements `b[0...k-1]` are `a[0...l_0-1]`, then `reversed(a[l_0...r_0])`, then `a[r_0+1...k-1]`.\nThe elements `b[k...n-1]` are identical to `a[k...n-1]`.\nNumber of 1s in `b[0...k-1]` = `(P1[l_0])`\n                                + `(P1[r_0+1] - P1[l_0])`\n                                + `(P1[k] - P1[r_0+1])`\n                                = `P1[k]`.\nNumber of 2s in `b[k...n-1]` = `P2[n] - P2[k]`.\nSo, for `k > r_0`, the LNDS contribution is `P1[k] + (P2[n] - P2[k])`.\n\n**Case 3: `l_0 < k <= r_0` (split point inside the reversed segment)**\nThe elements `b[0...k-1]` are `a[0...l_0-1]` followed by `reversed(a[l_0...k-1])`.\nNumber of 1s in `b[0...k-1]` = `P1[l_0]` (from `a[0...l_0-1]`)\n                                + `(P1[k] - P1[l_0])` (from `a[l_0...k-1]`, which is reversed)\n                                = `P1[k]`.\nThe elements `b[k...n-1]` are `reversed(a[k...r_0])` followed by `a[r_0+1...n-1]`.\nNumber of 2s in `b[k...n-1]` = `(P2[r_0+1] - P2[k])` (from `a[k...r_0]`, which is reversed)\n                                + `(P2[n] - P2[r_0+1])` (from `a[r_0+1...n-1]`)\n                                = `P2[n] - P2[k]`.\nSo, for `l_0 < k <= r_0`, the LNDS contribution is `P1[k] + (P2[n] - P2[k])`.\n\nThis is still `P1[k] - P2[k] + P2[n]`. This means the LNDS value is the same for *any* `l,r` pair, which is clearly wrong.\nThe mistake is in `(number of 1s in b[0...k-1])`. When a segment `a[l_0...r_0]` is reversed, the *order* of elements changes.\nIf `a[i]=1` and `a[j]=2` with `i < j`, and both `i, j` are in `[l_0, r_0]`, then after reversal, `a_rev[i']` might be 2 and `a_rev[j']` might be 1, with `i' < j'`. This is what allows for a longer LNDS.\n\nLet's re-think the LNDS calculation for a fixed `l_0, r_0`.\nThe elements `a[0...l_0-1]` remain `a[0...l_0-1]`. These contribute `P1[l_0]` 1s.\nThe elements `a[r_0+1...n-1]` remain `a[r_0+1...n-1]`. These contribute `P2[n] - P2[r_0+1]` 2s.\nThe reversed segment `a_rev = reversed(a[l_0...r_0])` is between these two.\n\nThe LNDS of `b` will be:\n`P1[l_0]` (1s from prefix `a[0...l_0-1]`)\n`+` `(max_{l_0 <= k_0 <= r_0+1} (count of 1s in reversed(a[l_0...k_0-1]) + count of 2s in reversed(a[k_0...r_0])))`\n`+` `(P2[n] - P2[r_0+1])` (2s from suffix `a[r_0+1...n-1]`)\n\nLet `current_lnds_in_reversed_segment` be `max_{l_0 <= k_0 <= r_0+1} (count of 1s in a[l_0...k_0-1] + count of 2s in a[k_0...r_0])`.\nNote that `count of 1s in a[l_0...k_0-1]` is `P1[k_0] - P1[l_0]`.\nAnd `count of 2s in a[k_0...r_0]` is `P2[r_0+1] - P2[k_0]`.\nSo, `current_lnds_in_reversed_segment = max_{l_0 <= k_0 <= r_0+1} ( (P1[k_0] - P1[l_0]) + (P2[r_0+1] - P2[k_0]) )`.\n\nThus, for a given `l_0, r_0`, the total LNDS is:\n`P1[l_0] + (max_{l_0 <= k_0 <= r_0+1} (P1[k_0] - P1[l_0] + P2[r_0+1] - P2[k_0])) + (P2[n] - P2[r_0+1])`.\nThis simplifies to:\n`max_{l_0 <= k_0 <= r_0+1} (P1[k_0] - P2[k_0]) + P2[n]`.\n\nThis is the correct formula! Let's trace it with the example: `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, `n=4`.\n`P1`: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\n`P2`: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`\n`diff[i] = P1[i] - P2[i]`: `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]` for `i=0..4`.\n`P2[n] = P2[4] = 2`.\n\nInitial `max_overall_lnds` (for no reversal, `l_0=0, r_0=n-1` is effectively `max_{0 <= k_0 <= n} diff[k_0] + P2[n]`):\n`max(0, 1, 0, 1, 0) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3`. (LNDS of `[1,2,1,2]` is 3, e.g., `1,1,2` or `1,2,2`)\n\nIterate `l_0` from `0` to `n-1`:\n  `l_0 = 0`: (corresponds to `l=1`)\n    `current_max_diff_in_segment = diff[l_0] = diff[0] = 0`. (This handles `k_0=l_0`)\n    For `r_0` from `0` to `n-1`:\n      `r_0 = 0`: (`l=1, r=1`, reverse `a[0]`)\n        `current_max_diff_in_segment = max(current_max_diff_in_segment, diff[r_0+1]) = max(0, diff[1]) = max(0, 1) = 1`.\n        `current_lnds = 1 + P2[4] = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n        `max_overall_lnds = max(3, 3) = 3`.\n      `r_0 = 1`: (`l=1, r=2`, reverse `a[0...1]`)\n        `current_max_diff_in_segment = max(current_max_diff_in_segment, diff[r_0+1]) = max(1, diff[2]) = max(1, 0) = 1`.\n        `current_lnds = 1 + P2[4] = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n        `max_overall_lnds = max(3, 3) = 3`.\n      ... and so on for `l_0=0`, `max_overall_lnds` remains 3.\n\n  `l_0 = 1`: (corresponds to `l=2`)\n    `current_max_diff_in_segment = diff[l_0] = diff[1] = 1`. (This handles `k_0=l_0`)\n    For `r_0` from `1` to `n-1`:\n      `r_0 = 1`: (`l=2, r=2`, reverse `a[1]`)\n        `current_max_diff_in_segment = max(current_max_diff_in_segment, diff[r_0+1]) = max(1, diff[2]) = max(1, 0) = 1`.\n        `current_lnds = 1 + P2[4] = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n        `max_overall_lnds = max(3, 3) = 3`.\n      `r_0 = 2`: (`l=2, r=3`, reverse `a[1...2]`)\n        `current_max_diff_in_segment = max(current_max_diff_in_segment, diff[r_0+1]) = max(1, diff[3]) = max(1, 1) = 1`.\n        `current_lnds = 1 + P2[4] = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n        `max_overall_lnds = max(3, 3) = 3`.\n      Still 3. This is where the example output is 4. My formula `max_{l_0 <= k_0 <= r_0+1} (P1[k_0] - P2[k_0]) + P2[n]` is calculating LNDS for the *original* array, but with `k_0` restricted to `[l_0, r_0+1]`. This is not what we want.\n\nThe issue is that `P1[k_0]` and `P2[k_0]` are based on the *original* sequence `a`.\nWhen we form the LNDS, we select 1s and 2s from the *modified* sequence `b`.\nThe `P1[k_0] - P2[k_0]` term is only valid if `b` is identical to `a`.\nWhen we reverse `a[l_0...r_0]`, the 1s and 2s within this segment are reordered.\nSo for a `k_0` such that `l_0 <= k_0 <= r_0+1`, the `count of 1s in reversed(a[l_0...k_0-1])` is actually `count of 1s in a[l_0...k_0-1]`, and `count of 2s in reversed(a[k_0...r_0])` is `count of 2s in a[k_0...r_0]`. This is correct.\nThe error must be in the interpretation of `k_0`. `k_0` is the split point *within the original indices of the reversed segment*.\n\nLet's consider the elements in `b`:\n`a[0], ..., a[l_0-1]`\n`a[r_0], a[r_0-1], ..., a[l_0]`\n`a[r_0+1], ..., a[n-1]`\n\nLet `i` be the index *in the original array* where the split occurs.\nThe LNDS of the modified array `b` is:\n`max_{0 <= i <= n}` of:\n`(count of 1s in a[0...i-1] if i < l_0)`\n`+ (count of 1s in a[0...l_0-1] + count of 1s in reversed(a[l_0...i-1]) if l_0 <= i <= r_0+1)`\n`+ (count of 1s in a[0...l_0-1] + count of 1s in reversed(a[l_0...r_0]) + count of 1s in a[r_0+1...i-1] if i > r_0+1)`\n`+ (count of 2s in a[i...n-1] if i < l_0)`\n`+ (count of 2s in reversed(a[i...r_0]) + count of 2s in a[r_0+1...n-1] if l_0 <= i <= r_0+1)`\n`+ (count of 2s in a[i...n-1] if i > r_0+1)`\n\nThis is exactly what the `O(N^3)` approach would calculate.\n`count_1s_in_b[0...k-1]` and `count_2s_in_b[k...n-1]` are not simply `P1[k]` and `P2[n]-P2[k]` if `k` is inside the reversed segment.\n\nLet's fix `l_0` and `r_0`.\nThe LNDS for `b` is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count1(b, k) + count2(b, k))`.\n`count1(b, k)` is number of 1s in `b[0...k-1]`.\n`count2(b, k)` is number of 2s in `b[k...n-1]`.\n\nFor `k` from `0` to `n`:\n  `current_count1 = 0`\n  `current_count2 = 0`\n  For `j` from `0` to `k-1`:\n    If `j < l_0` or `j > r_0`:\n      If `a[j] == 1`: `current_count1 += 1`\n    Else (`l_0 <= j <= r_0`):\n      If `a[l_0 + (r_0 - j)] == 1`: `current_count1 += 1` (element `a[j]` is now `a[r_0 - (j - l_0)]`)\n  For `j` from `k` to `n-1`:\n    If `j < l_0` or `j > r_0`:\n      If `a[j] == 2`: `current_count2 += 1`\n    Else (`l_0 <= j <= r_0`):\n      If `a[l_0 + (r_0 - j)] == 2`: `current_count2 += 1`\n  `max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, current_count1 + current_count2)`\n\nThis is `O(N)` for each `(l_0, r_0)` pair, leading to `O(N^3)` total.\n`N=2000`, `N^3 = 8 * 10^9`, too slow.\n\nWe need to optimize the LNDS calculation for each `(l_0, r_0)` pair.\nLet's fix `l_0`. Iterate `r_0` from `l_0` to `n-1`.\nWhen `r_0` increases by 1 to `r_0+1`, the segment `[l_0, r_0]` becomes `[l_0, r_0+1]`.\nThe new element `a[r_0+1]` is now part of the reversed segment.\n\nLet `LNDS(l_0, r_0)` be the maximum LNDS for a given `l_0, r_0`.\n`LNDS(l_0, r_0) = max_{0 <= k <= n} (count1(b, k) + count2(b, k))`\nwhere `b` is `a[0...l_0-1] + reversed(a[l_0...r_0]) + a[r_0+1...n-1]`.\n\nThe `count1(b, k)` part can be rewritten:\n`count1(b, k) = P1[min(k, l_0)]` (from unchanged prefix)\n               `+ (count of 1s in reversed(a[l_0...min(k, r_0)]))` (from reversed segment)\n               `+ (P1[k] - P1[r_0+1])` (from unchanged suffix, if `k > r_0`)\n\nThe `count2(b, k)` part can be rewritten:\n`count2(b, k) = (P2[l_0] - P2[k])` (from unchanged prefix, if `k < l_0`)\n               `+ (count of 2s in reversed(a[max(k, l_0)...r_0]))` (from reversed segment)\n               `+ (P2[n] - P2[max(k, r_0+1)])` (from unchanged suffix)\n\nThis is still complex.

Why?\nThe issue is that `val_in_middle` calculates the LNDS of `a[l_0...r_0]`.\nBut we reversed `a[l_0...r_0]`. The LNDS of `reversed(a[l_0...r_0])` is **not necessarily** the same as the LNDS of `a[l_0...r_0]`.\n\nExample: `a = [2, 1]`. `l_0=0, r_0=1`.\n`P1 = [0, 0, 1]`, `P2 = [0, 1, 1]`.\n`val_in_middle`:\n`k_0=0`: `(P1[0]-P1[0]) + (P2[2]-P2[0]) = 0 + 1 = 1`. (Take 0 1s, take all 2s from `[2,1]`)\n`k_0=1`: `(P1[1]-P1[0]) + (P2[2]-P2[1]) = 0 + 0 = 0`. (Take 1s from `[2]`, take 2s from `[1]`)\n`k_0=2`: `(P1[2]-P1[0]) + (P2[2]-P2[2]) = 1 + 0 = 1`. (Take all 1s from `[2,1]`, take 0 2s)\n`val_in_middle = 1`.\nLNDS of `[2,1]` is 1. (e.g. `2` or `1`).\n\nNow, `reversed(a)` is `[1, 2]`.\nLNDS of `[1,2]` is 2. (e.g. `1,2`).\nMy `val_in_middle` calculation gives 1 for this. This is the source of the error.\nThe `val_in_middle` calculation must be for the *reversed* segment.\n\nLet `R1[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[i...n-1]` (suffix sum of 1s).\nLet `R2[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]` (suffix sum of 2s).\n\nFor `reversed(a[l_0...r_0])`:\nWe need to find `max_{l_0 <= k_0 <= r_0+1} (count of 1s in reversed(a[l_0...k_0-1]) + count of 2s in reversed(a[k_0...r_0]))`.\n`count of 1s in reversed(a[l_0...k_0-1])` means 1s from `a[k_0-1], a[k_0-2], ..., a[l_0]`. This is `R1[l_0] - R1[k_0]`.\n`count of 2s in reversed(a[k_0...r_0])` means 2s from `a[r_0], a[r_0-1], ..., a[k_0]`. This is `P2[r_0+1] - P2[k_0]`.\n\nSo, `val_in_middle = max_{l_0 <= k_0 <= r_0+1} ( (R1[l_0] - R1[k_0]) + (P2[r_0+1] - P2[k_0]) )`.\nThis is `R1[l_0] + P2[r_0+1] + max_{l_0 <= k_0 <= r_0+1} (-R1[k_0] - P2[k_0])`.\nThis is `R1[l_0] + P2[r_0+1] - min_{l_0 <= k_0 <= r_0+1} (R1[k_0] + P2[k_0])`.\n\nLet's re-verify this with `a = [2, 1]`. `l_0=0, r_0=1`.\n`P1 = [0, 0, 1]`, `P2 = [0, 1, 1]`.\n`R1 = [1, 1, 0]`, `R2 = [1, 0, 0]`.\n`val_in_middle = R1[0] + P2[2] - min_{0 <= k_0 <= 2} (R1[k_0] + P2[k_0])`.\n`R1[0] = 1`, `P2[2] = 1`.\n`R1[k_0] + P2[k_0]`:\n`k_0=0: R1[0]+P2[0] = 1+0 = 1`.\n`k_0=1: R1[1]+P2[1] = 1+1 = 2`.\n`k_0=2: R1[2]+P2[2] = 0+1 = 1`.\n`min = 1`.\n`val_in_middle = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1`. Still 1. Expected 2.\n\nThe issue is with `R1[l_0] - R1[k_0]`. This is count of 1s in `a[l_0...k_0-1]`.\nBut if `a[l_0...k_0-1]` is reversed, the 1s are taken from `a[k_0-1], a[k_0-2], ..., a[l_0]`.\nThis is correct. The number of 1s is still the same.\n\nLet's use the `O(N^3)` approach for `a=[1,2,1,2]` with `l=2, r=3` (`l_0=1, r_0=2`).\nOriginal `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`\nReversed segment `a[1...2]` is `[2, 1]`.\nNew array `b = [1, 1, 2, 2]`.\nSplit point `k` for `b`:\n`k=0`: `count1(b,0)=0, count2(b,0)=4`.

The formula for `val_in_middle` is indeed the LNDS of the *original* segment `a[l_0...r_0]`.\n\nThe key is that the LNDS of `reversed(S)` is not necessarily the same as LNDS of `S`.\nExample: `S = [2,1]`, LNDS is 1. `reversed(S) = [1,2]`, LNDS is 2.\nMy `val_in_middle` calculates LNDS of `S`, not `reversed(S)`.\n\nTo calculate LNDS of `reversed(a[l_0...r_0])`:\nLet `sub_arr = a[l_0...r_0]`.\n`sub_arr_rev = reversed(sub_arr)`.\nLNDS of `sub_arr_rev` is `max_{0 <= k' <= len(sub_arr)} (count of 1s in sub_arr_rev[0...k'-1] + count of 2s in sub_arr_rev[k'...len(sub_arr)-1])`.\n`count of 1s in sub_arr_rev[0...k'-1]` is `P1_sub_arr_rev[k']`.\n`count of 2s in sub_arr_rev[k'...len(sub_arr)-1]` is `P2_sub_arr_rev[len(sub_arr)] - P2_sub_arr_rev[k']`.\nThis is `max_{k'} (P1_sub_arr_rev[k'] - P2_sub_arr_rev[k']) + P2_sub_arr_rev[len(sub_arr)]`.\n\nLet `val_in_middle_rev` be this value.\n`P1_sub_arr_rev[k']` means prefix sum of 1s in `reversed(a[l_0...r_0])`.\nThe `k'`-th element (0-indexed) of `reversed(a[l_0...r_0])` is `a[r_0 - k']`.\nSo `P1_sub_arr_rev[k']` is `count of 1s in a[r_0], a[r_0-1], ..., a[r_0 - (k'-1)]`.\nThis is `R1[r_0 - k' + 1]` (suffix sum of 1s starting from `r_0 - k' + 1`) `R1[r_0 - (k'-1)] - R1[r_0+1]`\nNo. This is `(total 1s in a[l_0...r_0]) - (1s in a[l_0...r_0-k'])`.\n`P1_sub_arr_rev[k'] = (P1[r_0+1] - P1[l_0]) - (P1[r_0-k'+1] - P1[l_0]) = P1[r_0+1] - P1[r_0-k'+1]`.\n\nSimilarly, `P2_sub_arr_rev[k'] = P2[r_0+1] - P2[r_0-k'+1]`.\nLet `j = r_0 - k' + 1`.

It is `count of 1s in a[r_0], ..., a[r_0 - k_0 + 1]` (if `k_0` is index in reversed segment).\n\nLet's use a simpler formulation for LNDS calculation in `O(N^2)`.\nIterate `i` from `0` to `n`. `i` is the split point for the final LNDS.\nFor each `i`, we want to find the best `l, r` to maximize `(count of 1s in b[0...i-1]) + (count of 2s in b[i...n-1])`.\n\nLet `left1[x]` be the count of 1s in `a[0...x-1]`.\nLet `right2[x]` be the count of 2s in `a[x...n-1]`.\nBoth can be precomputed in `O(N)`.\n\nFor each possible `l` (0-indexed, `0` to `n-1`):\n  For each possible `r` (0-indexed, `l` to `n-1`):\n    `current_max = 0`\n    For each split point `k` (0-indexed, `0` to `n`):\n      `count_ones = 0`\n      `count_twos = 0`\n      `# Calculate count_ones in b[0...k-1]`\n      `# Part before l`\n      `count_ones += left1[min(k, l)]`\n      `# Part inside [l, r] (reversed)`\n      `for x in range(l, min(k, r + 1)):`\n        `if a[r - (x - l)] == 1: # a[x] is now a[r-(x-l)]`\n          `count_ones += 1`\n      `# Part after r`\n      `if k > r:`\n        `count_ones += left1[k] - left1[r + 1]`\n\n      `# Calculate count_twos in b[k...n-1]`\n      `# Part before l`\n      `if k < l:`\n        `count_twos += right2[k] - right2[l]`\n      `# Part inside [l, r] (reversed)`\n      `for x in range(max(k, l), r + 1):`\n        `if a[r - (x - l)] == 2:`\n          `count_twos += 1`\n      `# Part after r`\n      `count_twos += right2[max(k, r + 1)]`\n\n      `current_max = max(current_max, count_ones + count_twos)`\n    `overall_max_lnds = max(overall_max_lnds, current_max)`\n\nThis is `O(N^4)`.

(standard LNDS DP).\nThis is not for a modified array.\n\nWhat if we fix the split point `k` for the LNDS?\nFor a fixed `k`, we want to find `l, r` that maximize `(count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`.\nLet `f(k, l, r) = (count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`.\nWe need `max_{0 <= k <= n} max_{0 <= l <= r < n} f(k, l, r)`.\n\nThis can be rewritten:\n`f(k, l, r) = (P1[l] + count_1s_in_reversed_segment_prefix + count_1s_in_suffix_prefix)`\n            `+ (count_2s_in_prefix_suffix + count_2s_in_reversed_segment_suffix + R2[r+1])`\n\nLet's simplify.\n`P1[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\n`S2[i]` = count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\n\nFor each `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n  For each `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n    `current_max_lnds = 0`\n    `# Calculate LNDS for b = a[0...l-1] + reversed(a[l...r]) + a[r+1...n-1]`\n    `# We need to find max over k of (count_1s_in_b[0...k-1] + count_2s_in_b[k...n-1])`\n    `# This can be done by iterating k from 0 to n`\n    `# For each k, count_1s_in_b[0...k-1] = P1[min(k,l)] + (count of 1s in reversed(a[l ... min(k-1,r)])) + (P1[k] - P1[r+1] if k > r+1 else 0)`\n    `# count of 1s in reversed(a[l ... min(k-1,r)]) is P1[min(k,r+1)] - P1[l]`\n    `# So count_1s_in_b[0...k-1] = P1[min(k,l)] + P1[min(k,r+1)] - P1[l] + (P1[k] - P1[r+1] if k > r+1 else 0)`\n\n    `# Similarly, count_2s_in_b[k...n-1] = S2[max(k,r+1)] + (count of 2s in reversed(a[max(k,l) ... r])) + (S2[max(k,l)] - S2[l] if k < l else 0)`\n    `# count of 2s in reversed(a[max(k,l) ... r]) is S2[max(k,l)] - S2[r+1]`\n    `# So count_2s_in_b[k...n-1] = S2[max(k,r+1)] + S2[max(k,l)] - S2[r+1] + (S2[max(k,l)] - S2[l] if k < l else 0)`\n\n    This is still `O(N^3)`. The `count of 1s in reversed(a[l...x])` is actually `P1[x+1] - P1[l]`.\n    And `count of 2s in reversed(a[x...r])` is `P2[r+1] - P2[x]`.\n    This means the LNDS of `reversed(a[l...r])` is the same as LNDS of `a[l...r]`. This is the core logical error.\n\nThe only way reversal changes the LNDS is if `a[i]=2, a[j]=1` with `i<j` becomes `a[i']=1, a[j']=2` with `i'<j'` *within the reversed segment*.\nThis means `a[l...r]` contains some `2`s followed by some `1`s. Reversing it makes it `1`s followed by `2`s.\n\nLet's try a different approach.\nThe maximum LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (P1[k] + (P2[n] - P2[k]))`.\nThis is the LNDS of the original sequence. Let this be `ans_base`.\nThe reversal can potentially improve this.\nIt improves it if we have a subsequence `...1, 2, 1, 2...` where the `2,1` part is reversed to `1,2`.\nThis means we have `...1, a[i]=2, a[i+1]=1, ... 2...`.\nIf we reverse `a[i...j]` containing `2`s followed by `1`s, it becomes `1`s followed by `2`s.\n\nWhat if we iterate over all possible `l, r`? `O(N^2)` pairs.\nFor each `l, r`:\n  Construct `b` (the array after reversal). `O(N)`.\n  Calculate LNDS of `b`. `O(N)`.\nThis is `O(N^3)`.\n\nThe crucial insight is that the LNDS of `b` is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (P1[l] + count_1s_in_reversed_segment_up_to_k_prime + count_2s_in_reversed_segment_from_k_prime + S2[r+1])`.\nWhere `k_prime` is a split point inside `[l,r]`.\n`P1[l]` is `count of 1s in a[0...l-1]`.\n`S2[r+1]` is `count of 2s in a[r+1...n-1]`.\nThe middle part, `count_1s_in_reversed_segment_up_to_k_prime + count_2s_in_reversed_segment_from_k_prime` is the LNDS of `reversed(a[l...r])`.\n\nLet `rev_a_lr = reversed(a[l...r])`.\nIts LNDS is `max_{0 <= k_in_rev <= len(rev_a_lr)} (count of 1s in rev_a_lr[0...k_in_rev-1] + count of 2s in rev_a_lr[k_in_rev...len(rev_a_lr)-1])`.\n`count of 1s in rev_a_lr[0...k_in_rev-1]` is equivalent to `count of 1s in a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[r - k_in_rev + 1]`.\n`count of 2s in rev_a_lr[k_in_rev...len(rev_a_lr)-1]` is equivalent to `count of 2s in a[r - k_in_rev], ..., a[l]`.\n\nLet `P1_rev[x]` be the count of 1s in `a[x...n-1]` (suffix sum of 1s).\nLet `P2_rev[x]` be the count of 2s in `a[x...n-1]` (suffix sum of 2s).\n`P1_rev[x]` is `R1[x]` from previous thoughts.\n`P2_rev[x]` is `R2[x]` from previous thoughts.\n\nSo, `count of 1s in rev_a_lr[0...k_in_rev-1]` is `P1_rev[r - k_in_rev + 1] - P1_rev[r + 1]`.\nAnd `count of 2s in rev_a_lr[k_in_rev...len(rev_a_lr)-1]` is `P2_rev[l] - P2_rev[r - k_in_rev + 1]`.\n\nLet `j = r - k_in_rev + 1`.
