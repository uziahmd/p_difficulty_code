Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**The Morse Code Parsing Conundrum**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this Morse code problem. It's essentially about parsing a constantly growing string of '0's and '1's into sequences of English letters.  I need a Python solution, and my brain is already starting to formulate some approaches.\n\nThe core of the problem, as I understand it, is this: we're given a string `S` that grows incrementally. After each addition of a '0' or '1', we have to figure out how many *different* ways we can break down *any* substring of `S` into valid Morse code letters, and then find the total combinations. Crucially, the answer needs to be modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nI've got the Morse code rules down. Letters are 1 to 4 characters long. There are 30 possible combinations, but only 26 of them are valid letters. The \"invalid\" codes are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". That's a key constraint I need to keep in mind.\n\nThe example clarifies a critical point that the substrings can be broken up in various ways. For instance, \"111\" can represent 'O', but it also can be interpreted as \"T\" + \"M\", \"M\" + \"T\", or \"T\" + \"T\" + \"T\". That flexibility is what makes this a bit more involved.\n\nMy initial thought is that this screams dynamic programming. I'm imagining a `dp[i]` that represents the number of ways to parse the substring `S[0...i-1]`. Each time we add a character to `S`, we'll need to update `dp` to account for the new possibilities.\n\nThe thing that I'm grappling with is how to efficiently account for all the different substrings and their possible letter combinations after each append operation. I need a smart way to track and sum those possibilities without getting bogged down in redundant calculations. The modulo operation is straightforward to implement, but the core logic for counting these sequences is where the real challenge lies. I feel like this DP approach is the right track, I just need to figure out the most elegant transition formula.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by *any* substring of `S`. A substring can be parsed into a sequence of letters if it can be broken down into valid Morse code representations of letters. The valid Morse codes are strings of length 1 to 4, excluding \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\nLet `S` be the current string of dots and dashes. We need to calculate the sum of `count_sequences(substring)` for all non-empty substrings of `S`.\n\nLet's define a helper function `is_valid_morse(code_str)` that returns `True` if `code_str` is a valid Morse code for an English letter, and `False` otherwise.\nThe invalid codes are: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\nAll other strings of length 1 to 4 consisting of '0's and '1's are valid.\n\nNow, consider a specific substring `sub = S[i:j]`. We want to find the number of ways to parse `sub` into a sequence of English letters. Let `dp_parse[k]` be the number of ways to parse the prefix `sub[0:k]` into a sequence of letters.\n*   `dp_parse[0] = 1` (empty prefix has one way to be parsed: as an empty sequence)\n*   For `k` from `1` to `len(sub)`:\n    *   `dp_parse[k] = 0`\n    *   For `l` from `1` to `4` (possible lengths of a Morse code):\n        *   If `k - l >= 0`:\n            *   Let `current_code = sub[k-l:k]`.\n            *   If `is_valid_morse(current_code)`:\n                *   `dp_parse[k] = (dp_parse[k] + dp_parse[k-l]) % MOD`\nThe total number of non-empty sequences for `sub` is `(dp_parse[len(sub)] - 1 + MOD) % MOD` (subtract 1 for the empty sequence).\n\nThis approach calculates the count for each substring independently. Since `S` can have length up to `3000`, there are `O(M^2)` substrings. For each substring, parsing takes `O(length * max_code_length)` time. This would be `O(M^4)` in total, which is too slow (`3000^4` is too large).\n\nWe need a more efficient dynamic programming approach that updates the total count as `S` grows.\n\nLet `S_total` be the string `S` after `k` appends.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse the suffix `S_total[i:]` into a sequence of English letters. This is not quite what we want.\n\nLet's rethink. When a new character `c` is appended to `S`, forming `S_new = S_old + c`, we need to calculate the total sum of sequences for all substrings of `S_new`. This sum can be broken down into:\n1.  Sum of sequences for substrings of `S_old`. (This is the previous answer).\n2.  Sum of sequences for substrings ending at the new character `S_new[len(S_old)]`.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `N`. We are interested in substrings `S[i:N]` for `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\nFor each `i`, let `f(i)` be the number of ways to parse `S[i:N]` into a sequence of English letters.\nThe total answer is `sum(f(i) for i in range(N)) % MOD`.\n\nWhen a new character `char` is appended to `S`, `S` becomes `S + char`. Let its new length be `N+1`.\nThe previous `f(i)` values are no longer valid, because the substring `S[i:N]` is now `S_new[i:N]`, not `S_new[i:N+1]`.\nInstead, let `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse the *suffix* `S[i:]` into a sequence of English letters.\nWhen `S` grows from `S_old` to `S_new = S_old + char`, `N` becomes `N+1`.\nThe new `dp` values are `dp_new`.\n`dp_new[N]` is the number of ways to parse `S_new[N:]` (which is just `char`) into a sequence of letters.\nThis is not quite right. `dp[i]` should be the number of ways to parse `S[i:]` into *non-empty* sequences.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of ways to parse the suffix `S[k:]` into a sequence of English letters.\nWhen `S` has length `N` (0-indexed `S[0...N-1]`):\n`dp[N] = 1` (representing an empty sequence, which is a base case for parsing)\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp[k] = 0`\n    For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n        If `k + l <= N`:\n            Let `code = S[k : k+l]`.\n            If `is_valid_morse(code)`:\n                `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+l]) % MOD`\n\nThe total number of *non-empty* sequences formed by parsing `S[i:N]` is `(dp[i] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`.\nThe overall answer for the string `S` is `sum((dp[i] - 1 + MOD) % MOD for i in range(N)) % MOD`.\n\nLet `S` be the current string.\n`current_total_ans = 0`\n`dp = [0] * (M + 1)` (where `M` is max length of `S`)\n`dp[N] = 1` (base case: empty suffix can be parsed in one way - as an empty sequence)\n\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`:\nLet `N` be the new length of `S`.\nWe need to calculate `dp[N-1]`.\n`dp[N-1] = 0`\nFor `l` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `N - 1 + l <= N` (i.e., `l=1`):\n        Let `code = S[N-1 : N-1+l]`. (`code = S[N-1]`)\n        If `is_valid_morse(code)`:\n            `dp[N-1] = (dp[N-1] + dp[N-1+l]) % MOD`\nThis is just `dp[N-1] = dp[N]` if `S[N-1]` is valid, else `0`.\n\nThis `dp[k]` definition is for parsing `S[k:]` into sequences of letters.\nWhat we actually need is `dp[k]` to be the number of ways to parse `S[k:]` into *non-empty* sequences.\nLet `dp_non_empty[k]` be the number of ways to parse `S[k:]` into non-empty sequences.\n`dp_non_empty[k] = sum(dp_non_empty[k+l] for valid_code S[k:k+l]) + sum(1 for valid_code S[k:k+l] where S[k:k+l] is a full parse)`\nThis is equivalent to:\n`dp_non_empty[k] = sum(dp_non_empty[k+l] + 1 for valid_code S[k:k+l])`\nThis is `dp_non_empty[k] = sum(dp[k+l] for valid_code S[k:k+l])` where `dp[k]` is the total ways to parse `S[k:]` (including empty sequence).\nSo `dp_non_empty[k] = (dp[k] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`.\n\nLet's maintain `dp[k]` as the number of ways to parse `S[k:]` into a sequence of letters (including empty).\nWhen `S` has length `N` (after `N` appends, 0-indexed `S[0...N-1]`):\n`dp[N] = 1`\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp[k] = 0`\n    For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n        If `k + l <= N`:\n            `code = S[k : k+l]`\n            If `is_valid_morse(code)`:\n                `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+l]) % MOD`\nThe total answer is `sum(dp[i] - 1 for i in range(N)) % MOD`.\n\nWhen a new character `char` is appended to `S`:\nLet `S_old` be the string before appending, length `N_old`.\nLet `S_new = S_old + char`, length `N_new = N_old + 1`.\nWe need to recompute `dp[N_new-1]`, `dp[N_new-2]`, ..., `dp[N_new-4]` (at most).\nThe values `dp[k]` for `k < N_new - 4` remain unchanged from `S_old` because they depend on parts of `S_old` that are not affected by the new character.\nSpecifically, `dp[k]` depends on `dp[k+1], dp[k+2], dp[k+3], dp[k+4]`.\nSo, when `char` is appended, only `dp[N_new-1]`, `dp[N_new-2]`, `dp[N_new-3]`, `dp[N_new-4]` might change.\n`dp[N_new]` is set to `1`.\nFor `k` from `N_new-1` down to `max(0, N_new-4)`:\n    `dp[k] = 0`\n    For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n        If `k + l <= N_new`:\n            `code = S_new[k : k+l]`\n            If `is_valid_morse(code)`:\n                `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+l]) % MOD`\n\nThe total answer for `S_new` is `sum(dp[i] - 1 for i in range(N_new)) % MOD`.\nThis can be updated incrementally.\nLet `total_ans` be the answer for `S_old`.\nWhen `S_new` is formed, we need to add `(dp[N_new-1] - 1 + MOD) % MOD` to `total_ans`.\nThis is because `dp[N_new-1]` is the number of ways to parse `S_new[N_new-1:]` (the last character).\nThis `dp[N_new-1]` uses `dp[N_new]` (which is 1).\nThe `dp[k]` for `k < N_old` are still based on `S_old[k:]`, not `S_new[k:]`.\nThis means `dp[k]` for `k < N_old` needs to be recomputed, as they now represent `S_new[k:]`.\n\nThe issue is that `dp[k]` depends on `S[k:k+l]`. When `S` grows, `S[k:k+l]` changes if `k+l > N_old`.\nThis means `dp[k]` for `k` near `N_old` needs to be recomputed.\nSpecifically, `dp[k]` depends on `dp[k+1], dp[k+2], dp[k+3], dp[k+4]`.\nThe new `dp[N_new]` is `1`.\n`dp[N_new-1]` depends on `dp[N_new]`.\n`dp[N_new-2]` depends on `dp[N_new-1], dp[N_new]`.\n`dp[N_new-3]` depends on `dp[N_new-2], dp[N_new-1], dp[N_new]`.\n`dp[N_new-4]` depends on `dp[N_new-3], dp[N_new-2], dp[N_new-1], dp[N_new]`.\n`dp[N_new-5]` depends on `dp[N_new-4], dp[N_new-3], dp[N_new-2], dp[N_new-1]`.\nSo, all `dp[k]` values from `0` to `N_new-1` need to be recomputed.\n\nThis means we calculate `dp[k]` for `k` from `N-1` down to `0` after each append.\nThis is `O(N * max_code_len)` per append. Total `O(M^2 * max_code_len)`.\nWith `M=3000`, `max_code_len=4`, this is `3000^2 * 4 = 3.6 * 10^7`, which should be acceptable.\n\nLet's refine the `is_valid_morse` function and the overall algorithm.\n\n`MOD = 10**9 + 7`\n`INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n\n`def is_valid_morse(s):`\n`    return 1 <= len(s) <= 4 and s not in INVALID_CODES`\n\n`S = []` (list of chars for efficient appending and slicing)\n`dp = [0] * (M + 1)` (dp[k] stores ways to parse S[k:] including empty sequence)\n`dp[0] = 1` (base case for empty string, will be shifted)\n\n`current_total_ans = 0`\n\nFor each `char` in input:\n    `S.append(char)`\n    `N = len(S)`\n\n    `dp[N] = 1` (base for the current length)\n\n    `newly_added_to_ans = 0`\n    `for k in range(N - 1, -1, -1):`\n        `old_dp_k = dp[k]` (store old value to find change)\n        `dp[k] = 0`\n        `for l in range(1, 5):`\n            `if k + l <= N:`\n                `code = \"\".join(S[k : k+l])`\n                `if is_valid_morse(code):`\n                    `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+l]) % MOD`\n        \n        `change_in_dp_k = (dp[k] - old_dp_k + MOD) % MOD`\n        `newly_added_to_ans = (newly_added_to_ans + change_in_dp_k) % MOD`\n\n    `current_total_ans = (current_total_ans + newly_added_to_ans) % MOD`\n    `print(current_total_ans)`\n\nLet's trace the `dp` update carefully.\nWhen `S` has length `N`, `dp[N]` is set to `1`.\nThe loop `for k in range(N - 1, -1, -1)` calculates `dp[N-1], dp[N-2], ..., dp[0]`.\nEach `dp[k]` is calculated using `dp[k+1], dp[k+2], dp[k+3], dp[k+4]`.\nThese `dp[k+l]` values are already the *newly computed* values (or `dp[N]=1`).\nSo, `dp[k]` will correctly be the number of ways to parse `S[k:]` (the current `S`).\n\nThe total answer is `sum(dp[i] - 1 for i in range(N))`.\nLet `Ans[N]` be this sum for string of length `N`.\n`Ans[N] = (sum(dp[i] for i in range(N)) - N + MOD * N) % MOD`.\nThis sum needs to be recomputed for `N` elements.\n\nLet's maintain `total_sum_dp = sum(dp[i] for i in range(N))`.\nWhen `S` grows from `N_old` to `N_new = N_old + 1`:\n`dp[N_new] = 1`.\nWe calculate `dp[N_new-1]`.\n`dp[N_new-1] = 0`\n`for l in range(1, 5):`\n    `if N_new - 1 + l <= N_new:` (`l` must be 1)\n        `code = S[N_new-1 : N_new-1+l]`\n        `if is_valid_morse(code):`\n            `dp[N_new-1] = (dp[N_new-1] + dp[N_new-1+l]) % MOD`\n\nThe `dp` values for `k < N_new - 1` are currently `dp_old[k]`.\nThese `dp_old[k]` values are based on `S_old[k:]`.\nNow, `S_new[k:]` is `S_old[k:] + char`.\nSo `dp_new[k]` for `k < N_new - 1` needs to be recomputed based on `dp_new[k+1], dp_new[k+2], dp_new[k+3], dp_new[k+4]`.\nThis means we *must* iterate `k` from `N_new-1` down to `0` and update `dp[k]`.\n\nLet `current_total_ans` be `sum((dp[i] - 1 + MOD) % MOD for i in range(N_old))`.\nWhen `char` is appended, `S` becomes `S_new` of length `N_new`.\nWe need to calculate `sum((dp_new[i] - 1 + MOD) % MOD for i in range(N_new))`.\n\nInitialize `dp` array of size `M+1` to all zeros.\n`MOD = 10**9 + 7`\n`INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n`S = []`\n\n`dp_values = [0] * (M + 1)` # dp_values[k] stores num ways to parse S[k:] (including empty)\n\n`for _ in range(m):`\n    `char = input()`\n    `S.append(char)`\n    `N = len(S)`\n\n    `dp_values[N] = 1` # Base case for current string length\n\n    `for k in range(N - 1, -1, -1):`\n        `dp_values[k] = 0`\n        `for l in range(1, 5):`\n            `if k + l <= N:`\n                `code = \"\".join(S[k : k+l])`\n                `if code not in INVALID_CODES:` # Check validity\n                    `dp_values[k] = (dp_values[k] + dp_values[k+l]) % MOD`\n            `else:`\n                `break` # No need to check longer codes if substring is too short\n\n    `total_sequences = 0`\n    `for i in range(N):`\n        `total_sequences = (total_sequences + dp_values[i] - 1 + MOD) % MOD` # Subtract 1 for empty sequence\n    `print(total_sequences)`\n\nThis looks correct and fits the `O(M^2 * max_code_len)` complexity.\n`M = 3000`, `max_code_len = 4`.\nOuter loop `M` times.\nInner loop `N` times (up to `M`).\nInnermost loop `max_code_len` times.\nTotal `M * M * max_code_len = 3000 * 3000 * 4 = 3.6 * 10^7` operations.\nEach operation is addition/modulo/string slice/set lookup.

So `S` as a list of characters is better.\n`\"\".join(S[k : k+l])` creates a new list `S[k:k+l]` (length `l`), then joins it.

This might TLE.\n\nIs there any way to update `total_sequences` incrementally?\n`total_sequences = sum((dp_values[i] - 1 + MOD) % MOD for i in range(N))`\nLet `old_total_sequences` be the sum for `N_old`.\n`new_total_sequences = old_total_sequences + (dp_values[N_new-1] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`\nThis is only true if `dp_values[i]` for `i < N_new-1` don't change.\nBut they *do* change.\nExample: `S_old = \"1\"`, `N_old = 1`. `dp_values[1]=1`. `dp_values[0]=1` (\"1\" is valid). `total_sequences = (1-1)=0`. Wait.\n`dp_values[0]` for \"1\" is 1. `total_sequences = (dp_values[0] - 1 + MOD) % MOD = 0`. This is wrong.\nFor `S = \"1\"`, there is one sequence: \"T\". So answer should be 1.\nMy `dp[k]` counts ways to parse `S[k:]` *including empty sequence*.\nSo `(dp[k] - 1 + MOD) % MOD` is the number of *non-empty* sequences starting at `k`.\nFor `S = \"1\"`:\n`N = 1`. `S = ['1']`.\n`dp_values[1] = 1`.\n`k = 0`:\n    `dp_values[0] = 0`.\n    `l = 1`: `k+l = 1 <= N`. `code = S[0:1] = \"1\"`. `\"1\"` is valid.\n    `dp_values[0] = (dp_values[0] + dp_values[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n`total_sequences = 0`.\n`i = 0`: `total_sequences = (0 + dp_values[0] - 1 + MOD) % MOD = (0 + 1 - 1 + MOD) % MOD = 0`.\nStill 0. What's wrong?\n\nThe problem states: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nFor `S = \"1\"`, the substring is \"1\". This can be parsed as \"T\". One sequence.\nMy `dp_values[0]` for \"1\" is 1. This means `S[0:]` (\"1\") can be parsed in 1 way (as \"T\").\nThe number of non-empty sequences from `S[0:]` is `dp_values[0] - 1 = 0`. This is where the error is.\n\nThe definition of `dp[k]` should be: `dp[k]` is the number of ways to parse `S[k:]` into a sequence of English letters.\n`dp[N] = 0` (empty suffix cannot be parsed into any sequence of letters).\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp[k] = 0`\n    For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n        If `k + l <= N`:\n            `code = S[k : k+l]`\n            If `is_valid_morse(code)`:\n                `dp[k] = (dp[k] + 1 + dp[k+l]) % MOD`\n                `+1` means parsing `S[k:k+l]` as a single letter.\n                `+dp[k+l]` means parsing `S[k:k+l]` as a letter, followed by a sequence from `S[k+l:]`.\n\nLet's re-trace `S = \"1\"` with this new `dp` definition:\n`N = 1`. `S = ['1']`.\n`dp_values[1] = 0`.\n`k = 0`:\n    `dp_values[0] = 0`.\n    `l = 1`: `k+l = 1 <= N`. `code = S[0:1] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n    `dp_values[0] = (dp_values[0] + 1 + dp_values[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 0) % MOD = 1`.\nNow `dp_values[0]` is 1 for `S=\"1\"`. This is correct. `S[0:]` can be parsed as \"T\".\n\nTotal answer is `sum(dp_values[i] for i in range(N)) % MOD`.\nWith `S = \"1\"`, `N = 1`.\n`total_sequences = 0`.\n`i = 0`: `total_sequences = (0 + dp_values[0]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\nThis is correct for `S = \"1\"`.\n\nLet's trace `S = \"11\"`:\n`N = 2`. `S = ['1', '1']`.\n`dp_values[2] = 0`.\n`k = 1`:\n    `dp_values[1] = 0`.\n    `l = 1`: `k+l = 2 <= N`. `code = S[1:2] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n    `dp_values[1] = (dp_values[1] + 1 + dp_values[2]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 0) % MOD = 1`.\n    `dp_values[1]` is 1 (parse \"1\" as \"T\").\n`k = 0`:\n    `dp_values[0] = 0`.\n    `l = 1`: `k+l = 1 <= N`. `code = S[0:1] = \"1\"`. \"1\" is valid.\n    `dp_values[0] = (dp_values[0] + 1 + dp_values[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n    `+1` for \"T\" (from `S[0:1]`).\n    `+dp_values[1]` for \"T\" (from `S[0:1]`) followed by sequence from `S[1:]` (which is \"T\"). So \"TT\".\n    `dp_values[0]` is 2. (Sequences are \"T\", \"TT\").\n    `l = 2`: `k+l = 2 <= N`. `code = S[0:2] = \"11\"`. \"11\" is valid.\n    `dp_values[0] = (dp_values[0] + 1 + dp_values[2]) % MOD = (2 + 1 + 0) % MOD = 3`.\n    `+1` for \"M\" (from `S[0:2]`).\n    `+dp_values[2]` means \"M\" followed by sequence from `S[2:]` (empty).\n    `dp_values[0]` is 3.

My calculation is `4`.\nWhat are the sequences for `S=\"11\"`?\nSubstrings are \"1\", \"11\".\n\"1\" can be parsed as \"T\". (1 sequence)\n\"11\" can be parsed as \"M\", \"TT\". (2 sequences)\nTotal: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nMy `dp[k]` definition is for parsing `S[k:]`.\nFor `S=\"11\"`, `dp[0]` should be 2 (\"M\", \"TT\"). `dp[1]` should be 1 (\"T\").\nSo `sum(dp[i])` should be `2+1 = 3`.\nMy `dp[0]` for \"11\" was 3. Why?\n`dp[0] = (dp[0] + 1 + dp[1])` for \"1\". `dp[0]` becomes `1+1=2`.\n`dp[0] = (dp[0] + 1 + dp[2])` for \"11\". `dp[0]` becomes `2+1=3`.\n\nThe problem is double counting.\n`dp[k]` should be the number of ways to parse `S[k:]` into a sequence of English letters.\nLet's consider `S[k:]`.\nIt can start with `S[k:k+l]` as a letter `L`.\nThen the rest `S[k+l:]` can be parsed in `dp[k+l]` ways.\nSo, `L` followed by `dp[k+l]` sequences.\nThe `+1` is for `L` itself (when `S[k+l:]` is empty).\nSo, for each valid `code = S[k:k+l]`, we add `(1 + dp[k+l])`.\nThis is exactly what I wrote: `dp[k] = (dp[k] + 1 + dp[k+l]) % MOD`.\n\nLet's re-examine the example `S=\"111\"`.

My calculation is 11.\n\nThe issue is how `dp[k]` is defined and how it contributes to the total.\nThe problem asks for \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with *some substring* of S\".\nIt means: `sum_{i=0 to N-1} sum_{j=i+1 to N} (number of ways to parse S[i:j])`.\nMy `dp[k]` is the number of ways to parse `S[k:]`. This is only for substrings starting at `k` and ending at `N-1`.\nThis is `sum_{i=0 to N-1} (number of ways to parse S[i:N])`.\nThis means I am only considering substrings that end at the current end of `S`.\nThe example has `S=\"111\"`.\nSubstrings: \"1\", \"11\", \"111\".\n\"1\" (S[0:1]): \"T\" (1 way)\n\"11\" (S[0:2]): \"M\", \"TT\" (2 ways)\n\"111\" (S[0:3]): \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" (4 ways)\nTotal = 1+2+4 = 7.\n\nThis implies that for each position `k`, `dp[k]` should be the number of ways to parse `S[k:j]` for various `j`.\nNo, that's not what `dp[k]` is.\n`dp[k]` is `num_ways_to_parse(S[k:])`.\nLet `num_ways_to_parse(sub)` be the function we need.\n`num_ways_to_parse(S[k:j])`:\n`dp_sub[0] = 1` (empty prefix)\nFor `p` from `1` to `len(sub)`:\n    `dp_sub[p] = 0`\n    For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n        If `p - l >= 0`:\n            `code = sub[p-l:p]`\n            If `is_valid_morse(code)`:\n                `dp_sub[p] = (dp_sub[p] + dp_sub[p-l]) % MOD`\n`num_ways_to_parse(sub) = (dp_sub[len(sub)] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`.\n\nThis is the `O(M^4)` calculation.\nThe `dp` state needs to capture something about *all* substrings, not just suffixes.\n\nLet `f[i]` be the number of ways to parse `S[i:]` into sequences of letters.\nLet `g[i]` be the number of ways to parse `S[i:]` into *a single letter*.\n`g[i] = sum(1 for l from 1 to 4 if S[i:i+l] is valid)`\n`f[i] = sum(g[i+l] + f[i+l] for l from 1 to 4 if S[i:i+l] is valid)`\nThis is not quite right. `f[i]` is not `dp[k]` from the example.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse the prefix `S[0...i-1]` into a sequence of English letters.\n`dp[0] = 1` (empty string)\n`dp[i] = sum(dp[i-l] for l from 1 to 4 if S[i-l:i] is valid)`\nThis gives the number of ways to parse `S[0...i-1]` into a sequence of letters.\nThis is not what we want. We want *any substring*.\n\nLet `total_count[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by any substring of `S` of length `i`. No, this is not right.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the total number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by any substring `S[j:i]` for `0 <= j < i`. In other words, the total count for all substrings ending at index `i-1`.\nWhen a new character `char` is appended to `S`, let the new length be `N`.\nWe need to calculate the sum of `count_sequences(S[j:N])` for `j` from `0` to `N-1`.\nLet `ways[k]` be the number of ways to parse `S[k:N]` into a sequence of English letters.\n`ways[N] = 0`.\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    `ways[k] = 0`\n    For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n        If `k + l <= N`:\n            `code = \"\".join(S[k : k+l])`\n            If `code not in INVALID_CODES`:\n                `ways[k] = (ways[k] + 1 + ways[k+l]) % MOD`\nThe total answer for the current `S` is `sum(ways[k] for k in range(N)) % MOD`.\n\nThis is exactly what I implemented in the second attempt.\nFor `S = \"1\"`, `N=1`. `ways[1]=0`. `ways[0]=1`. Total `1`. Correct.\nFor `S = \"11\"`, `N=2`. `ways[2]=0`.\n`k=1`: `ways[1]=1` (for \"1\").\n`k=0`: `ways[0]=0`.\n    `l=1`: `code=\"1\"`. `ways[0] = (0 + 1 + ways[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 1) % MOD = 2`.\n    `l=2`: `code=\"11\"`. `ways[0] = (2 + 1 + ways[2]) % MOD = (2 + 1 + 0) % MOD = 3`.\nTotal `ways[0]+ways[1] = 3+1 = 4`. Still `4`. Example says `3`.\n\nThe problem statement: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with *some substring* of S in Morse code.\"\nThe example `S=\"111\"`:\n\"T\" (from \"1\")\n\"M\" (from \"11\")\n\"O\" (from \"111\")\n\"TT\" (from \"11\")\n\"TM\" (from \"111\")\n\"MT\" (from \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (from \"111\")\nTotal 7.\n\nMy `ways` values for `S=\"111\"`: `ways[0]=7, ways[1]=3, ways[2]=1`.\nSum `7+3+1 = 11`. Still not 7.\n\nThe interpretation of \"represented with some substring\" is key.\nIf `S = \"111\"`, the substrings are:\n`\"1\"`: parses to \"T\". Count: 1.\n`\"11\"`: parses to \"M\", \"TT\". Count: 2.\n`\"111\"`: parses to \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". Count: 4.\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\nThis means we need to calculate `num_ways_to_parse(sub)` for each substring `sub`, and sum them up.\n`num_ways_to_parse(sub)` is:\nLet `dp_sub[p]` be the number of ways to parse `sub[0:p]` into a sequence of letters.\n`dp_sub[0] = 1` (empty prefix can be parsed in one way: empty sequence).\nFor `p` from `1` to `len(sub)`:\n    `dp_sub[p] = 0`\n    For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n        If `p - l >= 0`:\n            `code = sub[p-l:p]`\n            If `is_valid_morse(code)`:\n                `dp_sub[p] = (dp_sub[p] + dp_sub[p-l]) % MOD`\nThe number of non-empty sequences is `(dp_sub[len(sub)] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`.\n\nThis is the `O(M^4)` approach that I thought was too slow.\n`M=3000`. `M^4 = (3000)^4 = 8.1 * 10^13`. This is definitely too slow.\n`M^2 * max_len^2 = 3000^2 * 4^2 = 1.44 * 10^8`. This is `O(N^2 * L^2)` where `L` is max code length.\n\nLet's re-verify the `O(M^2 * L^2)` complexity:\nOuter loop `M` times (for each character appended).\nInside:\n  `N = len(S)` (current length, up to `M`).\n  `for k in range(N - 1, -1, -1)`: (loop `N` times)\n    `for l in range(1, 5)`: (loop `L` times)\n      `code = \"\".join(S[k : k+l])` (list slice `O(L)`, join `O(L)`). Total `O(L)`.\n      `if code not in INVALID_CODES`: `O(1)` (set lookup).\n  Total `O(M * N * L * L)`. Max `N` is `M`. So `O(M^2 * L^2)`.\nThis is `1.44 * 10^8`. Python operations are slow, so it's a tight fit.\nMaybe `\"\".join(S[k : k+l])` is not that bad for `l <= 4`. It's a small constant factor.\n\nLet's use the `dp` definition that matches the example's interpretation.\nLet `dp_sub[len]` be the number of ways to parse a string of length `len` (using only valid Morse codes).\n`dp_sub[0] = 1`.\n`dp_sub[1] = 1` (e.g., \"0\" or \"1\" is valid).\n`dp_sub[2] = 2` (e.g., \"00\" can be \"0\"+\"0\", or \"00\". \"01\" can be \"0\"+\"1\", or \"01\").\nThe problem is that `dp_sub[p]` depends on the actual characters, not just length.\n\nOkay, the `O(M^2 * L^2)` approach is the standard one for this type of problem where substrings are involved.
