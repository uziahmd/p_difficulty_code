And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm Design and Optimization for Average Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We need to efficiently compute the average sleep time over all *k*-day windows within a sequence of *n* days, represented by the array *a*. The core challenge here is to avoid redundant calculations, particularly given that *n* can be quite large.\n\nMy initial thought is that a straightforward approach iterating through all possible windows would be too slow (O(n*k) time complexity), potentially hitting the time limit.  We need a more clever strategy.\n\nThe key insight, as usual, is to employ a sliding window technique. We can compute the sum for the first *k*-day window in O(k) time. Then, each subsequent window's sum can be derived from the previous window's sum in O(1) time. We just subtract the element leaving the window and add the element entering.  This reduces the computation to O(n) overall.\n\nThe main idea then is this:\n1.  **Initialize:** Calculate the sum for the first window (`a[0] to a[k-1]`).\n2.  **Slide:** Iterate through the remaining windows, updating the running sum efficiently for each new window.\n3.  **Accumulate:** Maintain a `total_sum_of_all_weeks` variable.\n4.  **Average:** Once we've processed all the windows, divide the `total_sum_of_all_weeks` by the number of windows (`n - k + 1`) to get the final average.\n\nWe need to ensure accuracy. Integer overflow is a concern, but the problem's constraints imply that the data types in Python won't be a problem given that *n* and the maximum sleep time (*a*<sub>*i*</sub>) are bounded. Floating-point precision should be sufficient to represent the result to the requested accuracy.\n\nFinally, we have to consider edge cases, for instance when *k* equals *n* (only one full window), or *k* equals 1 (each day is a window). The logic should handle them correctly.  We need to test the logic by running a test for each one of the examples.\n\nAfter working through these checks, it seems we have a solid and efficient solution.\n",
