She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Browser\" Problem for an Optimal Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Browser\" problem, and I need to come up with a Python script for it. Let's break down my thought process. First, I have to figure out the core logic. I've got this scenario with `n` tabs initially, a cursor at position `pos`, and a range `[l, r]` that needs to be kept open. All tabs outside this range need to be closed. And I'm trying to minimize the number of seconds (or operations).\n\nSo, the actions I can take are pretty straightforward: move the cursor left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. The key is how `a` (minimum unclosed tab index) and `b` (maximum unclosed tab index) change with each closing action. When I close tabs left of `pos`, `a` jumps to `pos`. When I close tabs right, `b` becomes `pos`.\n\nThe goal is to get from the initial state (a = 1, b = n) to a state where `a = l` and `b = r`. I need to close the tabs outside of the `[l, r]` range.\n\nNow, let's look at the special cases. If `l = 1` and `r = n`, then everything is already perfect, and I just return 0 seconds.\n\nIf only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed, (e.g., `l > 1` and `r = n`), then my approach is dependent on where `pos` is relative to `l`. If `pos` is already at or past `l`, I just move the cursor to `l` and then close to the left, and the cost will be the number of moves to `l` + 1. Otherwise, if `pos` is to the left of `l`, I move to `l` and then close.  In either scenario, the time is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. This captures both scenarios nicely.\n\nNext, I need to consider closing tabs to the right of `r` (e.g., `l = 1` and `r < n`). I haven't completely worked through this case, but it will be similar to the above. The logic has to depend on how to efficiently get the cursor to the right of `r`.\n",
