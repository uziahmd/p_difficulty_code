Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Solving the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and I need to come up with a Python script to solve it.  Essentially, it boils down to maximizing the number of hours Vasily can light up his room with candles, given some initial candles and a rate at which burnt-out candles can be recycled into new ones.  The core of the problem is figuring out the most efficient way to use those candles.\n\nMy strategy is pretty straightforward.  I need to burn every new candle I have available immediately, since that's the only way to get those initial hours.  Then, as they burn out, I recycle them into new ones whenever possible.  This cycle continues until I'm left with no more new candles to burn and can't create any more from the remaining burnt-out ones.\n\nI'm thinking a simulation approach is best here. I'll use a loop to track the number of hours I've lit the room, and the number of new and burnt-out candles.  At each step, I burn all the new candles, update the total hours, and add those candles to the count of burnt-out ones. Then, I check how many new candles I can make from the burnt-out ones.  This is done through integer division to calculate the new candles crafted from the burnt-out count, with the remainder kept for the next crafting iteration.\n\nLet's break it down further, consider I start with variables for the total hours, new candles, and burnt-out candles.  The loop goes as long as the number of new candles is greater than 0.  In the loop, I'll update the total hours, increase burnt-out candles by the number of used new candles, and set the current new candle variable to zero.  Then, I'll calculate the new candles I can craft from the burnt out candles, using the integer division and modulo operators.\n\nLooking at example 4, 2 from the problem description, I can confirm the method works. Starting with 4 new candles, I burn them, gaining 4 hours, and have 4 burnt-out ones. I can craft 2 new ones, giving a total of 6 hours after the burn, and have 2 burnt-out candles. The process repeats, 2 burnt-out candles becomes 1 new candle.  With 1 burnt-out candle left over after this round, the loop terminates.  The total hour count matches the given answer.  This process should work for any set of initial conditions as it captures the most efficient cycle.\n",
