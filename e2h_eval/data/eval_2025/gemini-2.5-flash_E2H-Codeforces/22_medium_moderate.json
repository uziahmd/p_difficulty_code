After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Python Script for \"Marks\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Marks\" problem. First, I need a Python script to solve it efficiently. I've broken down the problem: the input's two numbers, `n` and `m`, and then a gradebook of `n` rows and `m` columns with the marks. My goal is to find how many students are \"successful\" based on their marks being the maximum in at least one subject.\n\nThe core idea is to find the maximum mark for each subject and then check if each student has that maximum in any of their subjects.\n\nI'll start by reading the input. It'll be more efficient to read each line as a string and convert the characters to integers.  Then, I create a `max_marks_per_subject` list to store these subject maxima.  I can iterate through the gradebook and update these maximums using `max()`.\n\nNext, I need to figure out which students are successful.  I'll initialize a `is_successful` list with all `False` values. Then, for each student and subject, if a student's mark matches the maximum for that subject, they're successful. I can then set `is_successful[student_index]` to `True` and break out of the inner loop, since we only need *one* subject to determine success.\n\nFinally, I count the `True` values in the `is_successful` list. I could do this by manually iterating and counting but `sum(is_successful)` will be more concise.\n\nThe data structures I'm using, a list of lists for the gradebook and a list for maximum marks and successful flags, are the most natural way to represent this information. I checked the constraints, and this should run in O(n*m) time complexity which is perfectly fine given the bounds. I optimized the maximum mark finding using `zip(*gradebook)` for a more Pythonic solution.  The code should be efficient and clear, meeting all the requirements of the problem.\n",
