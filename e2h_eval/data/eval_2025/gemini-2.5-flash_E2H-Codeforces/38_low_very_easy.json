    "thought": "**My Approach to the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem and I immediately start breaking down the core concepts.  They want two things: the minimum number of nodes (let's call it `n`) needed to create a `p`-reachable directed graph, and then, among all those optimal graphs, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.  Right, let's nail down the definitions first.\n\n\"Reachable from each other\" means nodes are in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).  A `p`-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` and they're mutually reachable.  A unidirectional pair `(u, v)` is a pair where there's a path from `u` to `v`, but not the reverse, and of course, `u != v`.\n\nThe first part, minimizing `n`, is the key.  If two nodes are in the same SCC, they automatically contribute to those reachable pairs.  The number of these pairs within an SCC of size `k` is simply `k * (k - 1) / 2`, derived from the ways to choose 2 from k, which is combination formula.  \n\nNow, we have `N` nodes in our graph, broken up into various SCCs, with sizes `k_1`, `k_2`, and so on.  The total number of nodes `N` is the sum of all the `k_i`s.  The total number of reachable pairs across all the SCCs is `sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2)`.  That sum must equal the given `p`.\n\nThe game here is minimizing `N` while hitting that target `p`. And it hits me: to minimize `N`, I want to maximize the sizes of these SCCs.  Because `k * (k - 1) / 2` grows quadratically, a larger SCC gives more pairs for a lower node count.  For example if I need 3 reachable pairs, three nodes in one SCC (3 nodes) is better than a combination of smaller SCCs (e.g. 6 nodes).  \n\nSo, I need to figure out the largest SCC size that I can fit within `p`.  Let `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2`.  I need to find the largest `k` where `f(k) <= p`.  Finding that `k` is key.  I can solve the quadratic equation `k^2 - k - 2p = 0` to find that optimal `k` . That `k` will be the most significant component of my solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for two values:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all `p`-reachable directed graphs with this minimum `n` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's define the terms:\n- **Reachable from each other**: Two nodes `u` and `v` are reachable from each other if there is a path from `u` to `v` and a path from `v` to `u`. This means `u` and `v` belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\n- **`p`-reachable graph**: A directed graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n- **Unidirectional pair `(u, v)`**: `u \\neq v`, there is a path from `u` to `v`, and there is no path from `v` to `u`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`**\n\nLet a graph have `N` nodes. Suppose these nodes are partitioned into `m` SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. The total number of nodes is `N = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m`.\nFor any SCC of size `k_i`, all `k_i` nodes are mutually reachable. The number of unordered pairs `(u, v)` with `u \\neq v` within this SCC is `k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2`.\nThe total number of such pairs in the graph is `P = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} k_j * (k_j - 1) / 2`. We are given that `P = p`.\n\nTo minimize `N` for a given `p`, we want to make the `k_j` values as large as possible. This is because the function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` grows quadratically, so using fewer, larger SCCs is more efficient in terms of nodes than using many smaller SCCs to achieve the same `p`.\n\nLet's find the largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 \\le p`. We can do this by solving `k^2 - k - 2p = 0` for `k`, which gives `k = (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2`. Since `k` must be an integer, we take `k_0 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2 \\rfloor`.\nThe number of pairs generated by an SCC of size `k_0` is `p_0 = k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2`.\nThe remaining pairs needed are `p_r = p - p_0`.\nIf `p_r = 0`, then we can form one SCC of size `k_0` and `n = k_0` nodes. This is the minimum possible `n`.\nIf `p_r > 0`, we need to find `k_1` such that `k_1 * (k_1 - 1) / 2 = p_r`. Since `p_r < k_0`, `k_1` will be smaller than `k_0`. We can find `k_1` in the same way: `k_1 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p_r}) / 2 \\rfloor`.\nThe minimum number of nodes `n` will be `k_0 + k_1`. (Note: `k_1` will be 0 or 1 if `p_r = 0`, so this covers the `p_r=0` case too).\n\nSo, the minimum number of nodes `n` is `k_0 + k_1`, where `k_0` is the largest integer such that `k_0(k_0-1)/2 <= p`, and `k_1` is the largest integer such that `k_1(k_1-1)/2 <= p - k_0(k_0-1)/2`.\n\n**Example:** If `p = 3`.\n`k_0 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8*3}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{25}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + 5) / 2 \\rfloor = 3`.\n`p_0 = 3 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 3`.\n`p_r = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n`k_1 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8*0}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + 1) / 2 \\rfloor = 1`.\nMinimum `n = k_0 + k_1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\nWait, this is wrong. If `p_r = 0`, we only need `k_0` nodes. The `k_1` calculation for `p_r=0` yields 1, which means an SCC of size 1. An SCC of size 1 contributes 0 pairs. So if `p_r = 0`, we don't need an additional SCC, thus `n = k_0`.\nCorrect logic:\n`k_0 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2 \\rfloor`.\n`p_0 = k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2`.\n`p_r = p - p_0`.\nIf `p_r = 0`, then `n = k_0`.\nIf `p_r > 0`, then we need an additional SCC. The number of nodes in this additional SCC will be `k_1 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p_r}) / 2 \\rfloor`.\nThe minimum `n` will be `k_0 + k_1`.\n\n**Example `p=3` revisited:**\n`k_0 = 3`. `p_0 = 3`. `p_r = 0`. So `n = k_0 = 3`.\nThis is correct: an SCC of 3 nodes gives 3 pairs.\n\n**Example `p=4`:**\n`k_0 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8*4}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{33}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + 5.74) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3.37 \\rfloor = 3`.\n`p_0 = 3 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 3`.\n`p_r = 4 - 3 = 1`.\nSince `p_r > 0`, we calculate `k_1`:\n`k_1 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8*1}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{9}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (1 + 3) / 2 \\rfloor = 2`.\nMinimum `n = k_0 + k_1 = 3 + 2 = 5`.\nThis is correct: one SCC of 3 nodes (3 pairs) and one SCC of 2 nodes (1 pair) sums to 4 pairs, using 3+2=5 nodes.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nA unidirectional pair `(u, v)` means `u \\neq v`, there's a path `u -> v`, and no path `v -> u`. This implies `u` and `v` are in different SCCs. Specifically, if `u` is in SCC `S_u` and `v` is in SCC `S_v`, then there must be a path from `S_u` to `S_v` in the condensation graph (graph of SCCs), and no path from `S_v` to `S_u`.\n\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we want to maximize paths between distinct SCCs. The optimal structure for this is a \"chain\" or \"line\" of SCCs in the condensation graph.\nLet the SCCs be `S_1, S_2, ..., S_m` with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`.\nWe arrange them such that there are edges `S_1 -> S_2 -> ... -> S_m`.\nThis means:\n- All nodes in `S_i` can reach all nodes in `S_j` if `i < j`.\n- No node in `S_j` can reach any node in `S_i` if `i < j`.\n\nThe number of unidirectional pairs from `S_i` to `S_j` (where `i < j`) is `k_i * k_j`.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs in this chain structure is `\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le m} k_i * k_j`.\n\nIn our construction for minimum `n`, we found two SCCs (or one if `p_r=0`):\n- `S_0` of size `k_0` (contributes `p_0` pairs).\n- `S_1` of size `k_1` (contributes `p_r` pairs).\nThe total number of nodes is `n = k_0 + k_1`.\n\nCase 1: `p_r = 0`.\nThis means `p = k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2`. We use one SCC of size `k_0`.\nIn this case, all `n=k_0` nodes are in the same SCC. There are no pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u` and `v` are in different SCCs. Therefore, there are no unidirectional pairs. Max unidirectional pairs = 0.\n\nCase 2: `p_r > 0`.\nThis means `p = k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2 + k_1 * (k_1 - 1) / 2`, where `k_0` and `k_1` are determined as described above, and `k_1 >= 2` (since `p_r > 0` implies `k_1 * (k_1-1)/2 = p_r > 0`).\nWe have two SCCs: `S_0` of size `k_0` and `S_1` of size `k_1`. The total number of nodes is `n = k_0 + k_1`.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we arrange them in a chain: `S_0 -> S_1`.\nThis means all `k_0` nodes in `S_0` can reach all `k_1` nodes in `S_1`.\nThe number of unidirectional pairs is `k_0 * k_1`.\n\nSo, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `k_0 * k_1`.\n\n**Summary of algorithm:**\n1. Calculate `k_0 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p}) / 2 \\rfloor`.\n2. Calculate `p_0 = k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2`.\n3. Calculate `p_r = p - p_0`.\n4. If `p_r == 0`:\n   - Minimum nodes `n = k_0`.\n   - Maximum unidirectional pairs `u_max = 0`.\n5. If `p_r > 0`:\n   - Calculate `k_1 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 8p_r}) / 2 \\rfloor`.\n   - Minimum nodes `n = k_0 + k_1`.\n   - Maximum unidirectional pairs `u_max = k_0 * k_1`.\n\n**Edge case `p=0`:**\n`k_0 = \\lfloor (1 + \\sqrt{1 + 0}) / 2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1 \\rfloor = 1`.\n`p_0 = 1 * (1 - 1) / 2 = 0`.\n`p_r = 0 - 0 = 0`.\nSince `p_r = 0`:\n`n = k_0 = 1`.\n`u_max = 0`.\nOutput: `1 0`. This is correct. A graph with 1 node has 0 pairs `u<v` and 0 unidirectional pairs.\nThe example output for `p=0` is `0 0`. This implies `n` can be 0. However, the problem states \"ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)`... `u != v`\". If `n=0`, there are no nodes, hence no pairs, so `p=0` is naturally achieved. If `n=0` is allowed, then `n=0` is the minimum for `p=0`.\nLet's assume `n >= 1` since nodes are typically labeled starting from 1 or 0, and `u < v` implies at least two distinct nodes. If `n=1`, there are no pairs `u < v`. So `n=1` also gives `p=0`.\nThe problem implies `u` and `v` are actual nodes. A graph with 0 nodes is an empty graph. An empty graph has 0 node pairs. So `n=0` is valid for `p=0`.\nIf `n=0` for `p=0`, then `u_max` is also 0. So `0 0` is correct for `p=0`.\nMy formula gives `1 0` for `p=0`.\nLet's adjust for `p=0`: if `p=0`, `n=0`, `u_max=0`. Otherwise, use the formula.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. If `p == 0`: Print `0 0`.\n2. Else:\n   a. Calculate `k_0 = int((1 + (1 + 8*p)**0.5) / 2)`.\n   b. Calculate `p_0 = k_0 * (k_0 - 1) // 2`.\n   c. Calculate `p_r = p - p_0`.\n   d. If `p_r == 0`:\n      - Minimum nodes `n = k_0`.\n      - Maximum unidirectional pairs `u_max = 0`.\n   e. If `p_r > 0`:\n      - Calculate `k_1 = int((1 + (1 + 8*p_r)**0.5) / 2)`.\n      - Minimum nodes `n = k_0 + k_1`.\n      - Maximum unidirectional pairs `u_max = k_0 * k_1`.\n   f. Print `n u_max`.\n\nLet's test with examples:\n- `p=3`:\n  `k_0 = int((1 + (1 + 8*3)**0.5) / 2) = int((1 + 5) / 2) = 3`.\n  `p_0 = 3 * 2 // 2 = 3`.\n  `p_r = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n  `n = 3`, `u_max = 0`. Output: `3 0`. Matches example.\n- `p=4`:\n  `k_0 = int((1 + (1 + 8*4)**0.5) / 2) = int((1 + 33**0.5) / 2) = int((1 + 5.744) / 2) = int(3.372) = 3`.\n  `p_0 = 3 * 2 // 2 = 3`.\n  `p_r = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n  `k_1 = int((1 + (1 + 8*1)**0.5) / 2) = int((1 + 3) / 2) = 2`.\n  `n = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n  `u_max = 3 * 2 = 6`. Output: `5 6`. Matches example.\n- `p=0`:\n  Special case: `0 0`.
