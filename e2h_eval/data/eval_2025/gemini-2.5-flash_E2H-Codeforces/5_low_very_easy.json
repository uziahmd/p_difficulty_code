Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Colored Boots Problem: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Colored Boots\" problem to tackle, and it's screaming \"greedy algorithm\" at me. Let's break this down. We have *n* left boots and *n* right boots, each with a color (letters or '?'). The goal is to maximize the number of compatible pairs. Compatibility is straightforward: either the colors match exactly, or one or both are '?'.\n\nThe input gives us *n*, the color strings *l* (left boots) and *r* (right boots). The output needs to be the maximum number of pairs and the indices of those pairs. Constraints say *n* is pretty sizable, up to 150,000, so efficiency is key.\n\nMy initial thought is to categorize and prioritize. We have exact color matches, then a specific color with a '?', and finally '?' with '?'. Exact matches are the most restrictive, so we'll knock those out first.\n\n**Strategy Development**\n\nTo optimize the matching process, I'm thinking of storing boot indices by color. I'll use dictionaries (or lists) `left_color_indices` and `right_color_indices`. Each will map a color to a list of its corresponding boot indices (1-based, of course). This way, finding available boots of a specific color will be a quick lookup.\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n\n1.  **Index Storage:** Iterate through the input strings and populate these dictionaries. For each boot, I'll add its index to the appropriate list based on its color. This lets me quickly grab a list of all left boots or all right boots for any given color.\n\n2.  **Exact Matches (Prioritize):** Iterate through the specific colors ('a' to 'z'). For each color, while there are available left boots *and* available right boots of that color, I'll pair them up. I'll pop the indices from the lists and add them to a `pairs` list.\n\n3.  **Specific vs '?':** Once I've handled exact matches, I'll then move onto pairing up the remaining boots.  This is where things get a little trickier, but the basic process will be the same.  If a color has boots left over, I should match those with the '?'.\n\n4.  **'?' with '?':** Finally, any remaining '?' boots can be matched with each other. This is the simplest step.\n\nSo, the plan is to first handle exact matches, then specific colors with question marks. That greedy approach *should* give the optimal solution. Now I've got a solid framework, let's turn this into code!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (one left, one right) and list these pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nThis problem can be solved using a greedy approach. The key idea is to prioritize matching boots that have fewer compatibility options.\n\nHere's the greedy strategy:\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices:** First, we need to efficiently access boots of a particular color. We'll create lists of 1-based indices for each color ('a' through 'z' and '?') for both left and right boots.\n    *   `left_color_indices[char]` will store a list of indices of left boots with color `char`.\n    *   `right_color_indices[char]` will store a list of indices of right boots with color `char`.\n\n2.  **Match Specific Colors (Exact Matches):** These are the most restrictive matches (e.g., 'a' with 'a'). If an 'a' boot can be matched with another 'a' boot, it's best to do so, as these specific boots have limited options.\n    *   Iterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z'.\n    *   While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color `c`:\n        *   Take one left boot index `li` and one right boot index `ri`.\n        *   Add `(li, ri)` to our `pairs` list.\n\n3.  **Match Remaining Specific Colors with Question Marks:** After step 2, any remaining specific-colored boots (`c`) must be matched with a '?' boot.\n    *   Iterate through each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z'.\n    *   While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color '?':\n        *   Take one left boot index `li` and one right boot index `ri` (from `right_color_indices['?']`).\n        *   Add `(li, ri)` to our `pairs` list.\n    *   Similarly, while there are available right boots of color `c` AND available left boots of color '?':\n        *   Take one left boot index `li` (from `left_color_indices['?']`) and one right boot index `ri`.\n        *   Add `(li, ri)` to our `pairs` list.\n\n4.  **Match Remaining Question Marks with Question Marks:** Finally, any remaining '?' boots can be matched with each other. This is the least restrictive match, so we do it last.\n    *   While there are available left boots of color '?' AND available right boots of color '?':\n        *   Take one left boot index `li` and one right boot index `ri`.\n        *   Add `(li, ri)` to our `pairs` list.\n\nThis greedy strategy works because:\n*   Exact specific matches ('a' with 'a') are prioritized. Using '?' for these specific boots would consume a flexible '?' boot unnecessarily.\n*   Specific-color boots are then matched with '?' boots. This ensures that specific boots, which still have limited options, are used up before '?' boots are exclusively matched with other '?' boots.\n*   '?' with '?' matches are done last, as these are the most flexible boots and can match anything. By this point, all more constrained matches have been made.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nLet's consider `l = \"abaca?b\"`, `r = \"zabbbcc\"` (`n=7`)\n\n1.  **Store Indices:**\n    `left_color_indices = {'a': [1, 3, 5], 'b': [2, 7], 'c': [4], '?': [6]}`\n    `right_color_indices = {'z': [1], 'a': [2], 'b': [3, 4], 'c': [5, 6, 7]}`\n\n2.  **Exact Matches:**\n    *   `'a'`: `left_a = [1, 3, 5]`, `right_a = [2]`. Match `(5, 2)`.\n        `pairs = [(5, 2)]`\n        `left_color_indices = {'a': [1, 3], 'b': [2, 7], 'c': [4], '?': [6]}`\n        `right_color_indices = {'z': [1], 'a': [], 'b': [3, 4], 'c': [5, 6, 7]}`\n    *   `'b'`: `left_b = [2, 7]`, `right_b = [3, 4]`. Match `(2, 3)`, then `(7, 4)`.\n        `pairs = [(5, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4)]`\n        `left_color_indices = {'a': [1, 3], 'b': [], 'c': [4], '?': [6]}`\n        `right_color_indices = {'z': [1], 'a': [], 'b': [], 'c': [5, 6, 7]}`\n    *   `'c'`: `left_c = [4]`, `right_c = [5, 6, 7]`. Match `(4, 5)`.\n        `pairs = [(5, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 5)]`\n        `left_color_indices = {'a': [1, 3], 'b': [], 'c': [], '?': [6]}`\n        `right_color_indices = {'z': [1], 'a': [], 'b': [], 'c': [6, 7]}`\n    *   No other exact matches.\n\n3.  **Specific with Question Mark:**\n    *   `'a'`: `left_a = [1, 3]`, `right_? = []`. No matches.\n    *   `'c'`: `left_c = []`, `right_c = [6, 7]`. `left_? = [6]`. Match `(6, 6)`.\n        `pairs = [(5, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 5), (6, 6)]`\n        `left_color_indices = {'a': [1, 3], 'b': [], 'c': [], '?': []}`\n        `right_color_indices = {'z': [1], 'a': [], 'b': [], 'c': [7]}`\n    *   No other specific boots remaining to match with '?'.\n\n4.  **Question Mark with Question Mark:**\n    *   `left_? = []`, `right_? = []`. No matches.\n\nTotal pairs: 5.\nOutput pairs: `(5, 2), (2, 3), (7, 4), (4, 5), (6, 6)`. This matches the example output (order may vary).\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Use `collections.defaultdict(list)` to store indices for each color.\n*   The `pop()` method on lists is efficient for taking the \"first available\" boot index.\n*   The character set is 'a' through 'z' and '?'. We can iterate through `string.ascii_lowercase` for specific colors.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\nimport string\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-based indices for each color\n    left_color_indices = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_indices = collections.defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_color_indices[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_color_indices[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # 1.
