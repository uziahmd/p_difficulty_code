    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"A Twisty Movement\" problem. The core is about maximizing the Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a segment of a given sequence.  The sequence is only 1s and 2s, which is key.  First, let's break down the problem and its constraints. We have a sequence `a` of length `n`, where each `a_i` is either 1 or 2. We can choose a sub-interval `[l, r]` and reverse that part. The goal is to maximize the LNDS of the resulting sequence, and `n` is limited to 2000.  Since we are dealing with 1s and 2s, any non-decreasing subsequence will simply be some number of 1s followed by some number of 2s.\n\n**Understanding LNDS with Only 1s and 2s:**\n\nThe fundamental insight here is the structure of the LNDS. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is essentially the count of 1s in the subsequence plus the count of 2s.  To maximize this, we want as many 1s *before* as many 2s as possible.  This means choosing a subsequence that looks like: `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. The main idea is that all selected 1s in the LNDS must precede all selected 2s in the *original* sequence's indices.\n\n**Reversal Impact and Optimization:**\n\nNow, reversing a sub-segment `[l, r]` changes the *order* of elements within that segment. Let the original array be `A`. After reversal, the subarray `A[l...r]` becomes `A[r...l]`. An LNDS can include elements from the beginning of `A`, the reversed part, and the end of `A`.  A key concept is the split point: for any LNDS we're building, somewhere there is a boundary where we've selected all our 1s and we transition to selecting 2s. This means that we want to iterate from all possible split points between 0 and n, and compute the number of 1s before that and number of 2s after that.\n\n**Developing the Solution's Structure:**\n\nBecause `n` is up to 2000, I think that an O(N^2) solution would work, but an O(N^3) one wouldn't. The most natural approach is to iterate through all possible `l` and `r` (the start and end of the reversed segment). Then, for each `l` and `r` and each split point, recalculate the new sequence `temp_a` based on that and, for each `temp_a`, find the LNDS. Inside that, finding the LNDS itself can be done in O(N). Let's aim for O(N^2) time complexity total.\n\n**Optimizing LNDS Calculation:**\n\nTo optimize, rather than recalculating the LNDS from scratch each time, precomputing some auxiliary arrays will speed up the process. We can create prefix sums for counts of 1s and 2s: `prefix_ones[i]` will hold the number of 1s up to index `i-1` and `prefix_twos[i]` will hold the number of 2s up to index `i-1`.  Similarly, we can have suffix sums for 2s. This allows for constant-time lookups for the count of 1s in any range of the original array. This way, we could calculate the number of ones and twos at each partition point without having to loop.\n\n**Refining LNDS Calculation with Split Point `k`:**\n\nLet's fix `l`, and `r`. Now, let's fix a `k`. If `k` comes before `l`, the reversed segments don't come into play. If `k` falls inside or after `l` and before or on `r`, the reversed segment needs to be calculated. The key to figuring this out: what elements from `A[l...r]` became 1s or 2s when they are flipped at indices less or equal to `k`. The elements `k - l` from the new reversed segments are from `l` to `k`.\n\n**Final Approach and Implementation Considerations:**\n\nSo, for each `l` and `r` I iterate:\n1.  Precompute `prefix_ones`, `prefix_twos`.\n2. For each split point `k`, calculate the number of 1s before `k` (including",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a single chosen subsegment `[l, r]` of the input array `a`. The array `a` consists only of 1s and 2s.\n\n**Key Observation for LNDS with 1s and 2s:**\nA non-decreasing subsequence in an array containing only 1s and 2s will always be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. That is, some number of 1s followed by some number of 2s. To maximize its length, we want to find a split point `k` (an index in the array) such that the total count of 1s in the prefix `a'[0...k-1]` plus the total count of 2s in the suffix `a'[k...n-1]` is maximized. The LNDS length for a given array `a'` is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (count_ones(a'[0...k-1]) + count_twos(a'[k...n-1]))`.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince `n` is up to 2000, an `O(N^2)` solution would be acceptable. A naive `O(N^3)` approach (iterating `l, r`, then `k`) might be too slow.\n\nLet's precompute prefix sums for 1s and 2s in the original array `a`.\nLet `prefix_ones[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\nLet `prefix_twos[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`.\nThese can be computed in `O(N)` time.\n`prefix_ones[0] = 0`, `prefix_twos[0] = 0`.\nFor `i` from `0` to `n-1`:\n`prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)`\n`prefix_twos[i+1] = prefix_twos[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)`\n\nThe number of 1s in `a[x...y]` is `prefix_ones[y+1] - prefix_ones[x]`.\nThe number of 2s in `a[x...y]` is `prefix_twos[y+1] - prefix_twos[x]`.\n\nNow, we iterate over all possible `l` and `r` (0-indexed, `0 <= l <= r < n`). There are `O(N^2)` such pairs.\nFor each `(l, r)` pair, we need to calculate the LNDS of the modified array `a'`.\nThe array `a'` consists of three parts:\n1. `a[0...l-1]` (unchanged prefix)\n2. `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]` (reversed segment)\n3. `a[r+1...n-1]` (unchanged suffix)\n\nWe can calculate the LNDS for `a'` by iterating through all possible split points `k` from `0` to `n`.\nFor a given `k`:\n`current_lnds = (count of 1s in a'[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in a'[k...n-1])`.\n\nLet's analyze `count_ones(a'[0...k-1])`:\n* If `k <= l`: All elements are from `a[0...k-1]`. Count is `prefix_ones[k]`.\n* If `l < k <= r+1`: Elements are from `a[0...l-1]` and then the *first `k-l` elements* of the reversed segment `a[r...l]`.\n    The count from `a[0...l-1]` is `prefix_ones[l]`.\n    The `k-l` elements from the reversed segment are `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[r-(k-l)+1]`.\n    The count of 1s in this subsegment of the *original* array `a` is `prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[r-(k-l)+1]`.\n    So, `count_ones = prefix_ones[l] + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[r-(k-l)+1])`.\n* If `k > r+1`: All elements are from `a[0...l-1]`, all of `a[r...l]`, and `a[r+1...k-1]`.\n    The count from `a[0...l-1]` is `prefix_ones[l]`.\n    The count from `a[r...l]` is `prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]` (total 1s in the original segment `a[l...r]`).\n    The count from `a[r+1...k-1]` is `prefix_ones[k] - prefix_ones[r+1]`.\n    So, `count_ones = (prefix_ones[l]) + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]) + (prefix_ones[k] - prefix_ones[r+1]) = prefix_ones[k]`.\n\nLet's analyze `count_twos(a'[k...n-1])`:\n* If `k <= l`: Elements are from `a[k...l-1]`, all of `a[r...l]`, and `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n    The count from `a[k...l-1]` is `prefix_twos[l] - prefix_twos[k]`.\n    The count from `a[r...l]` is `prefix_twos[r+1] - prefix_twos[l]`.\n    The count from `a[r+1...n-1]` is `prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1]`.\n    So, `count_twos = (prefix_twos[l] - prefix_twos[k]) + (prefix_twos[r+1] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1]) = prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k]`.\n* If `l < k <= r+1`: Elements are from the *remaining part* of the reversed segment `a[r...l]` and `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n    The remaining part of the reversed segment are `a[r-(k-l-1)-1], ..., a[l]`. These are `a[l...r-(k-l)]`.\n    The count of 2s in this subsegment of the *original* array `a` is `prefix_twos[r-(k-l)+1] - prefix_twos[l]`.\n    The count from `a[r+1...n-1]` is `prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1]`.\n    So, `count_twos = (prefix_twos[r-(k-l)+1] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1])`.\n* If `k > r+1`: All elements are from `a[k...n-1]`. Count is `prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k]`.\n\nCombining these:\nThis `O(N^3)` approach is correct but might be too slow. Let's try to optimize.\nNotice that `prefix_ones[k]` and `prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[k]` are the counts for the original array.\nThe parts that change are only those involving `l` and `r`.\n\nLet `total_ones = prefix_ones[n]`.\nLet `total_twos = prefix_twos[n]`.\n\nFor each `l, r` pair, the LNDS can be found by iterating `k`.\nThe number of 1s in `a'[0...k-1]` is `prefix_ones[l]` (from before `l`) + `ones_in_reversed_prefix(k-l)` (from `a[r...l]`) + `prefix_ones[k] - prefix_ones[r+1]` (from after `r`, if `k > r+1`).\nThe number of 2s in `a'[k...n-1]` is `twos_in_reversed_suffix(r-(k-l)+1)` (from `a[r...l]`) + `prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[r+1]` (from after `r`).\n\nA simpler way to think about the LNDS is to iterate through all possible split points `k` (0-indexed, `0 <= k <= n`).\nFor each `k`:\nThe number of 1s to the left of `k` is `prefix_ones[k]` if `k <= l` or `k > r`.\nThe number of 2s to the right of `k` is `total_twos - prefix_twos[k]` if `k <= l` or `k > r`.\nThe \"twist\" happens when `l < k <= r+1`.\nIn this case, the `1`s come from `a[0...l-1]` and then `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[r-(k-l)+1]`.\nThe `2`s come from `a[r-(k-l)], ..., a[l]` and then `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n\nLet's try a different perspective:\nThe `max_lnds` for the original array (no reversal) is `max_k (prefix_ones[k] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[k]))`. This is our initial `ans`.\nNow, consider reversing `a[l...r]`.\nThe elements `a[0...l-1]` and `a[r+1...n-1]` remain in their original positions.\nThe elements `a[l...r]` are reversed.\n\nThe LNDS can be formed by:\n1. Only `1`s from `a[0...l-1]`, `a[r...l]`, `a[r+1...n-1]`. Max length is `total_ones`.\n2. Only `2`s from `a[0...l-1]`, `a[r...l]`, `a[r+1...n-1]`. Max length is `total_twos`.\n3. `1`s from `a[0...i-1]` and `2`s from `a[j...n-1]` where `i <= l` and `j > r`.\n   Length: `prefix_ones[i] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[j])`. Maximize over `i <= l, j > r`.\n   This is fixed by `l` and `r` as `prefix_ones[l] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1])`.\n4. `1`s from `a[0...l-1]`, `1`s from `a[r...mid]` (reversed), `2`s from `a[mid-1...l]` (reversed), `2`s from `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n   This is the general case. We iterate `l` from `0` to `n-1`, and `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\n   For each `(l, r)` pair:\n     `current_lnds = 0`\n     `count_ones_before_l = prefix_ones[l]`\n     `count_twos_after_r = total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1]`\n\n     // Iterate through all possible split points `mid` *within the reversed segment* `[l, r]` (original indices)\n     // `mid` here represents the original index where the 1s stop and 2s start in the reversed segment.\n     // Effectively, we are looking at `a[r], ..., a[mid]` (these are 1s) and `a[mid-1], ..., a[l]` (these are 2s).\n     // The split point in the *new* array `a'` is effectively between `a[mid]` and `a[mid-1]` (original indices).\n     for `mid` from `l` to `r+1`: // `mid` is the point separating 1s from 2s in the *original* segment `a[l...r]`.\n                                 // `a[l...mid-1]` would become 2s, `a[mid...r]` would become 1s in the reversed segment.\n                                 // So we count 1s in `a[mid...r]` and 2s in `a[l...mid-1]`.\n        `ones_in_reversed_part = prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[mid]`\n        `twos_in_reversed_part = prefix_twos[mid] - prefix_twos[l]`\n        `current_lnds = max(current_lnds, count_ones_before_l + ones_in_reversed_part + twos_in_reversed_part + count_twos_after_r)`\n   The overall `max_lnds` is updated.\n\nThis approach is `O(N^3)`: `N^2` for `l, r` pairs, and `N` for `mid`.\nLet's re-evaluate the complexity of `O(N^3)` for `N=2000`. `2000^3 = 8 * 10^9`, which is too slow.\nHowever, if the inner loop is constant time, it's `O(N^2)`.\nThe `mid` loop is `O(N)`. The calculations inside are `O(1)` using prefix sums.\nSo it is indeed `O(N^3)`.\n\nLet's go back to the LNDS definition: `max_k (count_ones(a'[0...k-1]) + count_twos(a'[k...n-1]))`.\nThis formulation is `O(N)` for each `(l, r)` pair.\nThe key is that `count_ones(a'[0...k-1])` and `count_twos(a'[k...n-1])` can be computed in `O(1)` if we have prefix sums for the *current* `a'`. But computing prefix sums for `a'` takes `O(N)`.\n\nWe need to optimize the `max_k` calculation.\nLet `f(k) = count_ones(a'[0...k-1]) + count_twos(a'[k...n-1])`.\nWe want `max_{0 <= k <= n} f(k)`.\nThe term `count_ones(a'[0...k-1])` is `P1[k]` for `k <= l` and `k > r+1`.\nThe term `count_twos(a'[k...n-1])` is `S2[k]` for `k <= l` and `k > r+1` (where `S2[k] = total_twos - prefix_twos[k]`).\n\nLet's define `ones_in_reversed_prefix(len)` as the number of 1s in the first `len` elements of `a[r...l]`.\n`ones_in_reversed_prefix(len) = prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[r-len+1]` (assuming `r-len+1 >= l`).\nLet `twos_in_reversed_suffix(len)` as the number of 2s in the last `len` elements of `a[r...l]`.\n`twos_in_reversed_suffix(len) = prefix_twos[l+len] - prefix_twos[l]` (assuming `l+len <= r+1`).\n\nConsider the split point `k`.\n1. `k <= l`: `f(k) = prefix_ones[k] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[k])`. (Original LNDS up to `l`)\n2. `k > r+1`: `f(k) = prefix_ones[k] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[k])`. (Original LNDS from `r+1`)\n3. `l < k <= r+1`: This is the interesting part. `k` is inside the reversed segment (or just after it).\n   `count_ones(a'[0...k-1]) = prefix_ones[l] + ones_in_reversed_prefix(k-l)`.\n   `count_twos(a'[k...n-1]) = twos_in_reversed_suffix(r-(k-l)+1) + (total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1])`.\n   `f(k) = prefix_ones[l] + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[r-(k-l)+1]) + (prefix_twos[r-(k-l)+1] - prefix_twos[l]) + (total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1])`.\n   Let `j = r-(k-l)+1`. As `k` goes from `l+1` to `r+1`, `j` goes from `r` down to `l`.\n   `f(k) = prefix_ones[l] + prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[j] + prefix_twos[j] - prefix_twos[l] + total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1]`.\n   `f(k) = (prefix_ones[l] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_twos[r+1]) + total_twos + (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`.\n   This formula calculates the LNDS if the split point `k` is within the reversed segment. The `j` values are original indices from `l` to `r`.\n   We need to maximize this expression over `j` from `l` to `r`.\n   `max_{l <= j <= r} (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`.\n   The other terms `(prefix_ones[l] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_twos[r+1]) + total_twos` are constant for a fixed `l, r`.\n\nSo, for each `(l, r)` pair:\n1. Calculate `max_val_outside = max_{0 <= k <= l} (prefix_ones[k] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[k]))` and `max_{r+1 <= k <= n} (prefix_ones[k] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[k]))`. This is just the LNDS of the original array up to `l` and from `r+1`.\n   This is equivalent to `max_{0 <= k <= l} (prefix_ones[k] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[k]))` and `max_{r+1 <= k <= n} (prefix_ones[k] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[k]))`.\n   Let `max_lnds_original = max_{0 <= k <= n} (prefix_ones[k] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[k]))`.\n   The `max_val_outside` part is `prefix_ones[l] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1])`.\n   This is the LNDS if we only use elements outside `[l, r]`.\n2. Calculate `max_val_inside = (prefix_ones[l] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_twos[r+1]) + total_twos + max_{l <= j <= r} (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`.\n\nThe `max_{l <= j <= r} (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])` part can be computed efficiently.\nFor each `l`, as `r` increases, we can maintain the maximum of `(prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])` for `j` in `[l, r]`.\nLet `dp_val[j] = prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j]`.\nThen we need `max_{l <= j <= r} dp_val[j]`. This is a Range Maximum Query.\nA simple `O(N)` scan for `max_j` for each `(l, r)` makes it `O(N^3)`.\nHowever, for a fixed `l`, as `r` increases, `max_{l <= j <= r} dp_val[j]` can be updated in `O(1)` by taking `max(previous_max, dp_val[r])`.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n1. Precompute `prefix_ones` and `prefix_twos` arrays (size `n+1`). `O(N)`.\n2. Initialize `max_overall_lnds = 0`.\n3. Iterate `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n   Initialize `current_max_dp_val = -infinity`.\n   Iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n     `current_max_dp_val = max(current_max_dp_val, prefix_twos[r] - prefix_ones[r])`.\n     `current_lnds = prefix_ones[l] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1])` // LNDS using only elements outside `[l, r]`\n     `current_lnds = max(current_lnds, prefix_ones[l] - prefix_twos[l] + prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_twos[r+1] + total_twos + current_max_dp_val)` // LNDS using elements from `[l, r]`\n\n     `max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, current_lnds)`.\n4. The final answer is `max_overall_lnds`.\n\nThis refined algorithm is `O(N^2)`.\n`N=2000`, `N^2 = 4 * 10^6` operations, which is well within time limits.\n\nLet's double check the `max_val_outside` part.\nThe LNDS can be formed by:\n1. Only elements from `A[0...l-1]` and `A[r+1...n-1]`.\n   The 1s would come from `A[0...l-1]` and 2s from `A[r+1...n-1]`.\n   Length: `prefix_ones[l] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1])`.\n2. Elements from `A[0...l-1]`, some 1s from reversed `A[l...r]`, some 2s from reversed `A[l...r]`, some 2s from `A[r+1...n-1]`.\n   This is captured by the `max_{l <= j <= r} (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])` term.\n\nThe initial `max_overall_lnds` should be at least `total_ones` (if all are 1s) or `total_twos` (if all are 2s).\nAlso, it should be at least the LNDS of the original array.\nThe formula `prefix_ones[l] + prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[j] + prefix_twos[j] - prefix_twos[l] + total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1]`\ncan be rewritten as:\n`prefix_ones[l] - prefix_twos[l]` (contribution from `A[0...l-1]`)\n`+ (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])` (contribution from `A[j...r]` as 1s and `A[l...j-1]` as 2s from the reversed segment)\n`+ (total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1])` (contribution from `A[r+1...n-1]`)\n`+ (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_twos[r+1])` (this term is not correct. It should be `prefix_ones[r+1]` for 1s and `total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1]` for 2s.)\n\nLet's use the definition `f(k) = count_ones(a'[0...k-1]) + count_twos(a'[k...n-1])`.\nFor `l < k <= r+1`:\n`count_ones(a'[0...k-1]) = prefix_ones[l] + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[r-(k-l)+1])`\n`count_twos(a'[k...n-1]) = (prefix_twos[r-(k-l)+1] - prefix_twos[l]) + (total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1])`\nSumming these:\n`f(k) = prefix_ones[l] + prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[r-(k-l)+1]`\n       `+ prefix_twos[r-(k-l)+1] - prefix_twos[l] + total_twos - prefix_twos[r+1]`\nLet `j = r-(k-l)+1`. As `k` goes from `l+1` to `r+1`, `j` goes from `r` down to `l`.\n`f(k) = (prefix_ones[l] - prefix_twos[l]) + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_twos[r+1]) + total_twos + (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`.\nThis is exactly the formula used in step 3. So the logic is correct.\n\nThe initial `max_overall_lnds` should be set to `0` or `1` (if `n >= 1`).\nThe maximum value of LNDS is at least the LNDS of the original array. This is covered because if `l=0, r=0` (or any `l=r` where `a[l]=1`), it will consider `max_{0 <= j <= 0} (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])` which is `prefix_twos[0]-prefix_ones[0]=0`.\nThis logic handles the case where the reversed segment `[l, r]` is empty (which is not allowed by `1 <= l <= r <= n`), or if it's a single element.\nThe problem statement says `1 <= l <= r <= n`. My 0-indexed `l, r` are `0 <= l <= r < n`.\n\nThe LNDS of the original array is `max_{0 <= k <= n} (prefix_ones[k] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[k]))`.\nLet's call this `original_lnds`.\nThe final answer should be `max(original_lnds, max_overall_lnds_from_reversal)`.\nMy `max_overall_lnds` calculation implicitly includes `original_lnds`.\nWhen `l=0` and `r=n-1`:\n`current_lnds = prefix_ones[0] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[n]) = 0 + 0 = 0`. (This is the \"outside\" part, which is empty)\n`current_max_dp_val` for `j` from `0` to `n-1` is `max_{0 <= j < n} (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`.\nThe second term becomes:\n`prefix_ones[0] - prefix_twos[0] + prefix_ones[n] - prefix_twos[n] + total_twos + max_{0 <= j < n} (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`\n`= 0 - 0 + total_ones - total_twos + total_twos + max_{0 <= j < n} (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`\n`= total_ones + max_{0 <= j < n} (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`.\nThis is `total_ones + max_{0 <= j < n} (prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`.\nThis is equivalent to `max_{0 <= j < n} (prefix_ones[n] + prefix_twos[j] - prefix_ones[j])`.\nThis is `max_{0 <= j < n} (prefix_ones[n] - prefix_ones[j] + prefix_twos[j])`.\nThis is essentially `max_k (count of 1s in A[k...n-1] + count of 2s in A[0...k-1])`.\nThis is the LNDS of the *reversed* entire array.\nSo my `O(N^2)` solution correctly computes the LNDS for all `(l,r)` reversals, including the original (by having an `l` and `r` that effectively don't change anything, or `l=0, r=n-1` effectively reversing the whole array).\nThe `max_overall_lnds` should be initialized to `0`. If `n=0`, the result is `0`. If `n>=1`, the LNDS is at least `1`.\n\nExample 1: `4`, `1 2 1 2`\n`a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`\n`prefix_ones = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\n`prefix_twos = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`\n`total_ones = 2`, `total_twos = 2`.\n\nInitialize `max_overall_lnds = 0`.\n\nl=0:\n  r=0: `a'=[1,2,1,2]`. `current_max_dp_val = prefix_twos[0]-prefix_ones[0] = 0`.\n    `current_lnds = prefix_ones[0] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[1]) = 0 + (2-0) = 2`.\n    `current_lnds = max(2, prefix_ones[0]-prefix_twos[0] + prefix_ones[1]-prefix_twos[1] + total_twos + current_max_dp_val)`\n    `= max(2, 0-0 + 1-0 + 2 + 0) = max(2, 3) = 3`.\n    `max_overall_lnds = max(0, 3) = 3`.\n  r=1: `a'=[1,2,1,2]`. `current_max_dp_val = max(0, prefix_twos[1]-prefix_ones[1]) = max(0, 0-1) = 0`.\n    `current_lnds = prefix_ones[0] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[2]) = 0 + (2-1) = 1`.\n    `current_lnds = max(1, 0-0 + 1-1 + 2 + 0) = max(1, 2) = 2`.\n    `max_overall_lnds = max(3, 2) = 3`.\n  r=2: `a'=[1,2,1,2]`. `current_max_dp_val = max(0, prefix_twos[2]-prefix_ones[2]) = max(0, 1-1) = 0`.\n    `current_lnds = prefix_ones[0] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[3]) = 0 + (2-1) = 1`.\n    `current_lnds = max(1, 0-0 + 2-1 + 2 + 0) = max(1, 3) = 3`.\n    `max_overall_lnds = max(3, 3) = 3`.\n  r=3: `a'=[1,2,1,2]`. `current_max_dp_val = max(0, prefix_twos[3]-prefix_ones[3]) = max(0, 1-2) = 0`.\n    `current_lnds = prefix_ones[0] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[4]) = 0 + (2-2) = 0`.\n    `current_lnds = max(0, 0-0 + 2-2 + 2 + 0) = max(0, 2) = 2`.\n    `max_overall_lnds = max(3, 2) = 3`.\n...
