The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$.

In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Plan for Maximizing Chests**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is clear: open as many chests as possible.  We've got `n` chests and `m` keys, each with a number.  A key works on a chest only if the sum of their numbers is odd.  That means the key and chest must have different parities – one odd, the other even.\n\nEach key can be used only once, and each chest can only be opened once. The key to solving this is to categorize everything by parity (odd or even). I'll count how many odd and even chests and keys there are. Let's call them `C_odd`, `C_even`, `K_odd`, and `K_even`.\n\nNow, here's the key insight: `odd_chests` *must* use `even_keys`, and `even_chests` *must* use `odd_keys`.  We can have two independent pairings:\n1.  `odd_chests` with `even_keys`: limited by whichever is smaller,  `min(C_odd, K_even)`.\n2.  `even_chests` with `odd_keys`:  limited by `min(C_even, K_odd)`.\n\nSince a key only opens one chest, these pairings are mutually exclusive. We can just add the maximum matches from each type. The total number of chests opened is `min(C_odd, K_even) + min(C_even, K_odd)`.  It's just a matter of counting parities and doing those two minimum calculations. I need to make sure I handle the example cases. This looks like the right approach, given the examples provided. Now, to write the code!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open given `n` chests and `m` keys. Each chest `i` has a number `a_i` and each key `j` has a number `b_j`. A key `b_j` can open a chest `a_i` if and only if the sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities.\nThere are two scenarios for a valid pairing:\n1. If `a_i` is an odd number, then `b_j` must be an even number.\n2. If `a_i` is an even number, then `b_j` must be an odd number.\n\nWe can categorize the chests and keys based on their parity:\n- Let `C_odd` be the count of chests with odd numbers.\n- Let `C_even` be the count of chests with even numbers.\n- Let `K_odd` be the count of keys with odd numbers.\n- Let `K_even` be the count of keys with even numbers.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible pairings:\n- **Pairing odd chests with even keys**: An `odd` chest can only be opened by an `even` key. The maximum number of such pairings is limited by the number of available odd chests (`C_odd`) and the number of available even keys (`K_even`). Therefore, we can make `min(C_odd, K_even)` such pairings.\n- **Pairing even chests with odd keys**: An `even` chest can only be opened by an `odd` key. The maximum number of such pairings is limited by the number of available even chests (`C_even`) and the number of available odd keys (`K_odd`). Therefore, we can make `min(C_even, K_odd)` such pairings.\n\nCrucially, these two types of pairings are independent. An odd chest will never need an odd key, and an even chest will never need an even key. This means the resources (chests and keys) for these two types of pairings are completely separate:\n- Odd chests only \"compete\" for even keys.\n- Even chests only \"compete\" for odd keys.\n\nSince these two sets of pairings use disjoint sets of chests and keys, the total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of the maximum pairings from each scenario.\n\nTotal maximum chests = `min(C_odd, K_even)` + `min(C_even, K_odd)`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `C_odd = 0`, `C_even = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`, check its parity: if `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `C_even`; otherwise, increment `C_odd`.\n4. Initialize `K_odd = 0`, `K_even = 0`.\n5. Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`, check its parity: if `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `K_even`; otherwise, increment `K_odd`.\n6. Calculate `min(C_odd, K_even) + min(C_even, K_odd)`.\n7. Print the result.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n=5, m=4`\n`a = [9, 14, 6, 2, 11]`\n`b = [8, 4, 7, 20]`\n\n1. **Chest parities:**\n   - `9` (odd)\n   - `14` (even)\n   - `6` (even)\n   - `2` (even)\n   - `11` (odd)\n   So, `C_odd = 2`, `C_even = 3`.\n\n2. **Key parities:**\n   - `8` (even)\n   - `4` (even)\n   - `7` (odd)\n   - `20` (even)\n   So, `K_odd = 1`, `K_even = 3`.\n\n3. **Calculate matches:**\n   - Matches for odd chests with even keys: `min(C_odd, K_even) = min(2, 3) = 2`.\n   - Matches for even chests with odd keys: `min(C_even, K_odd) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n\n4. **Total maximum chests:** `2 + 1 = 3`.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it only requires iterating through the chest numbers and key numbers once to count parities, resulting in an `O(n + m)` time complexity. The space complexity is `O(n + m)` if we store the numbers in lists, or `O(1)` if we process them as they are read without storing the entire lists (though storing them is fine given the constraints).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and m from the first line\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the chest numbers and store them in a list\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Read the key numbers and store them in a list\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Initialize counters for odd and even chests\n    c_odd = 0\n    c_even = 0\n\n    # Iterate through chest numbers to count their parities\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:  # If the number is even\n            c_even += 1\n        else:  # If the number is odd\n            c_odd += 1\n\n    # Initialize counters for odd and even keys\n    k_odd = 0\n    k_even = 0\n\n    # Iterate through key numbers to count their parities\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:  # If the number is even\n            k_even += 1\n        else:  # If the number is odd\n            k_odd += 1\n\n    # Calculate the maximum number of pairings for odd chests with even keys.\n    # This is limited by the number of odd chests and the number of even keys.\n    matches_odd_chest_even_key = min(c_odd, k_even)\n\n    # Calculate the maximum number of pairings for even chests with odd keys.\n    # This is limited by the number of even chests and the number of odd keys.\n    matches_even_chest_odd_key = min(c_even, k_odd)\n\n    # The total maximum number of chests opened is the sum of these two independent maximums.\n    total_matches = matches_odd_chest_even_key + matches_even_chest_odd_key\n\n    # Print the final result\n    print(total_matches)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the program\nsolve()\n\n```",
