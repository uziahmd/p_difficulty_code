Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The goal is a Python script to find the longest substring that appears at least twice within a given string (made of lowercase letters, length at most 100).**  My plan is to iterate through all possible substring lengths, then check each substring of that length for occurrences.\n\nBreaking it down, I will go through each possible substring length, starting from the longest (N-1) down to 1 (because a substring of length N can only appear once in a string of length N). For each length, I'll generate all the substrings of that length, and for each substring, I'll count how many times it shows up in the original string. The trick is: *these occurrences can overlap*.  I'll keep track of the longest substring found so far that occurs at least twice.\n\nThe problem states string length is at most 100.  A *naive* approach would involve three nested loops: one for the length, one for the starting index of the substring, and a third, inside, for counting occurrences of a particular substring with `s.count()`. However, `s.count()` itself can be inefficient, potentially making the whole process take too long (O(N^4) at worst). While Python's `count` is fairly optimized, it may still become a bottleneck.\n\nA better method would be to avoid `s.count()` and count occurrences by hand, iterating through the string and checking for matches explicitly. So,  for each substring length, I'd loop through all starting positions, checking for matches with a second internal loop.  This would still be O(N^4), which may be a bit slow for a time limit, which I suspect will be the case. So I need to find something more efficient.\n\nInstead of starting with lengths, I thought I could build a dictionary to store all substrings and their counts. In this approach, I would generate *every* possible substring and, for each one, increase its counter in the dictionary. Then, I could iterate through the dictionary and return the length of the longest substring that occurs more than once. The construction of the dictionary would be O(N^3) (due to the nested loops generating substrings) and iterating would be O(N^2) (at most the number of unique substrings is O(N^2)).\n\nAfter reviewing the example and the problem constraints (especially given the \"very hard question\" comment) the O(N^3) using dictionary seems like the right approach. It generates substrings, then checks their counts. It's robust (handles overlapping substring occurrences) and fast enough for a string length of 100. I also need to be careful with edge cases (empty strings).\n\nI'll finalize with a clean and clear O(N^3) solution that meets the requirements!\n",
