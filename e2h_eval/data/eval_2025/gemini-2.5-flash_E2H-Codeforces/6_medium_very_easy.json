Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI need to solve a competitive programming problem where I'm given vouchers and need to find two non-overlapping ones whose durations add up to a specific value, minimizing their combined cost.  I immediately recognize this is a classic optimization problem with constraints.\n\nA naive, brute-force approach (checking all pairs) is way too slow.  I need a more efficient algorithm, probably involving a clever use of data structures or a specific algorithmic technique. The constraints on the input size suggest an O(n log n) or O(n) solution is needed.\n\nI'm thinking about how to handle the \"non-overlapping\" constraint.  If two vouchers don't overlap, one must end before the other begins. Sorting by start or end times seems like a promising direction.\n\nThe fixed total duration suggests I should focus on one voucher at a time and efficiently find a \"partner\" voucher that completes the duration. I'm imagining a data structure to quickly look up potential partners. A sweep-line approach starts to form in my mind, where I process vouchers based on their start or end times.\n\nI decide to sort vouchers. Processing end times seems helpful because it directly relates to the non-overlapping condition. I can iterate through \"days\" and consider vouchers that start and end on those days, and use a data structure to maintain information about vouchers that have already ended.\n\nTo avoid the quadratic complexity, I decide to use an array where the index is the duration and the value is the minimum cost for a voucher with that duration. Now, I have a clear plan:\n1. Initialize the array with a large value.\n2. Iterate through each day (start to max).\n    * Start: process vouchers starting on that day. Query the array for partner vouchers, and update the global minimum cost.\n    * Update: process vouchers ending on that day. Update the array with the minimum cost for that duration.\n\nThe data structure should keep track of the minimum cost of a voucher, grouped by their duration. To efficiently find a partner voucher, I need to know, for each possible duration value, the lowest cost encountered so far. That’s what `min_cost_for_duration` will do.\n\nI realize that it's crucial to process queries *before* updates to avoid including vouchers that are starting on the same day as a possible partner. I will need to iterate through possible durations and keep track of the minimum costs for each duration.\n\nI now have a refined plan: I’ll maintain `min_cost_for_duration[duration]` where `min_cost_for_duration` is an array that stores the minimum cost of a voucher with `duration` that has ended *before* the current day. I'll iterate through all possible coordinates and, for each coordinate, I do two things:\n1.  Query for vouchers starting on the coordinate\n2. Update the `min_cost_for_duration` for vouchers ending on the coordinate\n\nIf I can iterate through all possible start times, it must work. I'm now pretty confident this approach is correct and efficient.\n\nI double-check my plan with an example and make sure the logic is right, and then write the code and test it again with several cases. It is working!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct vouchers, say `i` and `j`, such that:\n1.  They do not intersect. This means either voucher `i` ends before voucher `j` begins (`ri < lj`), or voucher `j` ends before voucher `i` begins (`rj < li`).\n2.  The sum of their durations is exactly `x`. The duration of a voucher `k` is `rk - lk + 1`.\n3.  Their total cost (`costi + costj`) is minimized.\n\nIf no such pair exists, we should output -1.\n\nLet's denote the duration of voucher `k` as `duration_k = rk - lk + 1`.\nWe are looking for two vouchers `i` and `j` such that `duration_i + duration_j = x` and they are non-overlapping. Without loss of generality, let's assume `ri < lj`.\n\nThis problem can be efficiently solved using a sweep-line algorithm. We can iterate through the days from `1` to `MAX_COORD` (where `MAX_COORD` is the maximum possible value for `li` or `ri`, which is `2 * 10^5`).\n\nWe'll use a data structure, let's call it `min_cost_for_duration`, which will store the minimum cost found so far for a voucher of a specific duration that has *already ended*. Specifically, `min_cost_for_duration[d]` will store the minimum cost of a voucher `k` such that `duration_k = d` and `rk < current_day`.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   `MAX_COORD = 200000` (from problem constraints).\n    *   `min_cost_for_duration`: An array of size `MAX_COORD + 1`, initialized with `float('inf')`. `min_cost_for_duration[d]` will store the minimum cost of a voucher with duration `d` that has ended *before* the current day.\n    *   `min_total_cost`: Initialize with `float('inf')`. This will store our final answer.\n    *   `vouchers_by_start`: A dictionary (or list of lists) where `vouchers_by_start[l]` contains a list of `(cost, duration)` for all vouchers that start on day `l`.\n    *   `vouchers_by_end`: A dictionary (or list of lists) where `vouchers_by_end[r]` contains a list of `(cost, duration)` for all vouchers that end on day `r`.\n\n2.  **Preprocessing**: Read all `n` vouchers. For each voucher `(li, ri, costi)`:\n    *   Calculate `duration_i = ri - li + 1`.\n    *   Add `(costi, duration_i)` to `vouchers_by_start[li]`.\n    *   Add `(costi, duration_i)` to `vouchers_by_end[ri]`.\n\n3.  **Sweep-line Iteration**: Iterate `day` from `1` to `MAX_COORD`:\n    *   **Step A: Process vouchers starting on `day`**: For each voucher `(cost_curr, duration_curr)` in `vouchers_by_start[day]`:\n        *   We need to find a partner voucher `j` such that `duration_j = x - duration_curr` and `rj < day`.\n        *   Calculate `needed_duration = x - duration_curr`.\n        *   If `1 <= needed_duration <= MAX_COORD` (duration must be positive and within bounds) and `min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration]` is not `float('inf')`:\n            *   This means we found a valid partner voucher `j` that ended before `day` and has the required duration.\n            *   Update `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_curr + min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration])`.\n    *   **Step B: Update `min_cost_for_duration` with vouchers ending on `day`**: For each voucher `(cost_v, duration_v)` in `vouchers_by_end[day]`:\n        *   This voucher has now ended. It becomes available to be a partner for any voucher starting on `day + 1` or later.\n        *   Update `min_cost_for_duration[duration_v] = min(min_cost_for_duration[duration_v], cost_v)`.\n\n4.  **Result**: After iterating through all days:\n    *   If `min_total_cost` is still `float('inf')`, it means no valid pair of vouchers was found. Print `-1`.\n    *   Otherwise, print `min_total_cost`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis**:\n*   **Time Complexity**:\n    *   Preprocessing (reading input and populating `vouchers_by_start`, `vouchers_by_end`): `O(N)`.\n    *   Sweep-line iteration: The loop runs `MAX_COORD` times. Inside the loop, each voucher is processed twice: once when its `li` matches `day` (Step A), and once when its `ri` matches `day` (Step B). Array lookups and updates are `O(1)`. Therefore, the total time for the sweep-line is `O(MAX_COORD + N)`.\n    *   Overall time complexity: `O(N + MAX_COORD)`. Given `N, MAX_COORD <= 2 * 10^5`, this is `O(2 * 10^5)`, which is efficient enough.\n*   **Space Complexity**:\n    *   `vouchers_by_start`, `vouchers_by_end`: Each stores `N` voucher entries in total. `O(N)`.\n    *   `min_cost_for_duration`: An array of size `MAX_COORD + 1`. `O(MAX_COORD)`.\n    *   Overall space complexity: `O(N + MAX_COORD)`. This is also efficient enough.\n\nThe problem states `ri < lj` or `rj < li`. My algorithm explicitly finds pairs `(voucher_j, voucher_i)` such that `rj < li`. Because the cost and duration sums are commutative, finding `(voucher_j, voucher_i)` where `rj < li` is equivalent to finding `(voucher_i, voucher_j)` where `ri < lj` (just relabel `i` and `j`). Thus, this approach correctly covers both conditions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # MAX_COORD is the maximum possible value for l_i or r_i.\n    # Given constraints: 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 2 * 10^5\n    MAX_COORD = 200000\n\n    # vouchers_by_start[l] stores a list of (cost, duration) for vouchers starting on day l.\n    vouchers_by_start = defaultdict(list)\n    # vouchers_by_end[r] stores a list of (cost, duration) for vouchers ending on day r.\n    vouchers_by_end = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l, r, cost = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers_by_start[l].append((cost, duration))\n        vouchers_by_end[r].append((cost, duration))\n\n    # min_cost_for_duration[d] stores the minimum cost of a voucher with duration 'd'\n    # that has already ended (i.e., its r < current_day).\n    min_cost_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (MAX_COORD + 1)\n\n    min_total_cost = float('inf')\n\n    # Iterate through each day from 1 up to MAX_COORD\n    for day in range(1, MAX_COORD + 1):\n        # Step 1: Process vouchers that *start* on the current 'day'.\n        # For each such voucher, try to find a suitable partner from those that have already ended.\n        for cost_curr, duration_curr in vouchers_by_start[day]:\n            needed_duration = x - duration_curr\n            \n            # A valid needed_duration must be positive and within the possible range.\n            # A voucher with duration 0 or negative is not possible.\n            # A duration cannot exceed MAX_COORD (max days covered).\n            if 1 <= needed_duration <= MAX_COORD:\n                if min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration] != float('inf'):\n                    min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_curr + min_cost_for_duration[needed_duration])\n        \n        # Step 2: Update min_cost_for_duration with vouchers that *end* on the current 'day'.\n        # These vouchers become available for pairing with vouchers starting on future days (day + 1 or later).\n        for cost_v, duration_v in vouchers_by_end[day]:\n            min_cost_for_duration[duration_v] = min(min_cost_for_duration[duration_v], cost_v)\n\n    if min_total_cost == float('inf'):\n        sys.stdout.write(\"-1\\n\")\n    else:\n        sys.stdout.write(str(min_total_cost) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
