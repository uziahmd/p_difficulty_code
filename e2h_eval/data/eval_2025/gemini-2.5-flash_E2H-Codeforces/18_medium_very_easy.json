    "thought": "**Frog Jumping Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this \"Frog Jumping\" problem. It seems like we're tasked with figuring out how many distinct positions a frog can reach within a certain range, and then summing those counts across a range of input values. My initial instinct is to break this down methodically.\n\nFirst, the frog's movement is straightforward: it can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`. There's the crucial constraint that the frog must remain within the bounds of `[0, x]`. This immediately makes me think about boundary conditions and avoiding off-by-one errors. The core function, `f(x)`, represents the number of reachable integers given `x`, and the ultimate goal is to calculate the sum of `f(i)` for values of `i` up to `m`.\n\nMy first inclination is to visualize the problem as a graph. Integers are nodes, and the jumps are edges. We're essentially searching for reachable nodes from `0` within the interval. This suggests a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. I need to keep track of reachable nodes, possibly using a boolean array or set.\n\nThe jumps `+a` and `-b` lead me to consider the Greatest Common Divisor (`gcd`) of `a` and `b`. The `gcd` seems relevant because any reachable number must be expressible as some combination of multiples of `a` and `b`, and by Bezout's identity, the `gcd` is the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as such a combination.  It's clear that all reachable numbers must be multiples of the `gcd`, which hints at a possible simplification: diving everything by the `gcd`. The problem would be simplified and easier to compute.\n\nHowever, I realize this alone is not enough, because while any reachable number is a multiple of the `gcd`, not all multiples of the gcd are *necessarily* reachable within the imposed constraint. The constraint of staying within `[0,x]` adds the extra complication of avoiding negative and oversized values with respect to the `x` bound. Therefore, it's not simply counting multiples of `gcd`. This brings me back to the BFS or DFS, ensuring validity of each move.\n\nI then think about the special case where `a` and `b` are co-prime (their `gcd` is `1`). In the absence of constraints, the problem becomes easier, but for the actual solution, this simplification is not enough, because any approach needs to stay within the bounds `[0, x]`. I also consider how large `x` is in the real input space. When `x` is large, a naive BFS is too slow.\n\nThen I get a crucial insight.  Instead of repeatedly doing BFS for each `x`, perhaps there's a more efficient way to compute `f(x)`. If I divide by the `gcd(a, b)`, I can simplify the problem. My strategy then is to use Dijkstra's Algorithm on states representing the remainders when a reachable number is divided by `b`. This appears promising because it efficiently finds the smallest reachable number for each remainder class. By the end of Dijkstra, I have the values in array `dist`, which contains the smallest `k` that has a specific remainder. All reachable numbers that belong to a certain remainder class can then be expressed as `dist[r]+ n*b` for integer `n`. Using this representation, a closed form calculation is possible.\n\nGiven this, I have a clear algorithm. First, I compute the `gcd`.  I then perform Dijkstra's Algorithm, which takes `O(b log b)` time where `b` is `b_prime` in my thinking, since I've already divided by the `gcd` at this stage. Afterwards I get a collection of remainders `dist[r]` and can use a formula to sum the reachable points and, by doing this, can compute `f(x)` for any `x`. Since the main task is to compute a sum from 0 to m, it's efficient. This approach seems far more efficient than repeated BFS runs. This `sum` computation then takes constant time, as far as I can see. I think this approach is the right one.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach starting from `0`, given it can jump `+a` or `-b`, and must always stay within the interval `[0, x]`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any reachable position `k` must be a multiple of `g`.\nWe can simplify the problem by dividing `a`, `b`, and `x` by `g`. Let `a' = a/g`, `b' = b/g`, and `X = x/g`. The frog now jumps `+a'` or `-b'`, and must stay within `[0, X]`. The number of reachable points `k` in `[0, x]` is equal to the number of reachable points `k'` in `[0, X]` using `a'` and `b'` jumps. Let this new function be `f'(X)`. So, `f(x) = f'(floor(x/g))`.\n\nThe sum we need to calculate is `sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) = sum_{i=0}^{m} f'(floor(i/g))`.\nThis sum can be grouped by values of `floor(i/g)`:\nLet `m_prime = floor(m/g)`.\nThe sum can be written as:\n`sum_{k=0}^{m_prime-1} (g * f'(k)) + (m - m_prime*g + 1) * f'(m_prime)`.\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`g * (sum_{k=0}^{m_prime} f'(k)) - (g - (m % g + 1)) * f'(m_prime)`.\nSo, the problem reduces to calculating `sum_{k=0}^{m_prime} f'(k)` and `f'(m_prime)` where `gcd(a', b') = 1`. Let's drop the primes for now and assume `gcd(a, b) = 1`, and `m` is the new `m_prime`.\n\nTo calculate `f(x)` (or `f'(X)`), we need to find all reachable points in `[0, x]`.\nSince `gcd(a, b) = 1`, we know that for any integer `r` from `0` to `b-1`, there exist reachable points `k` such that `k % b == r`.\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum non-negative integer `k` such that `k % b == r` and `k` is reachable from `0` (staying non-negative during intermediate steps).\nWe can find all `dist[r]` values using Dijkstra's algorithm. The states in Dijkstra are `0, 1, ..., b-1`.\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0` and `dist[r] = infinity` for `r > 0`.\nPush `(0, 0)` to a min-priority queue (cost, remainder).\nWhen extracting `(d, u)` from the priority queue:\n1. If `d > dist[u]`, continue (already found a shorter path).\n2. Consider jumping `+a`: `v = (u + a) % b`. The new cost to reach `v` is `d + a`. If `d + a < dist[v]`, update `dist[v] = d + a` and push `(d + a, v)` to the priority queue.\nAfter Dijkstra, `dist[r]` will hold the minimum reachable value `k` such that `k % b == r`.\n\nFor any `r`, if `k_0 = dist[r]` is reachable, then `k_0 + b`, `k_0 + 2b`, `k_0 + 3b`, ... are also reachable, as long as they stay non-negative. This is because if `k_0` is reachable, we can take `a` jumps to `k_0+p*a` and then `b` jumps down to `k_0` again. Since `gcd(a,b)=1`, we can reach `k_0+b` from `k_0` by a sequence of `+a` and `-b` jumps, ensuring all intermediate points are non-negative.\nSo, for a given `r`, the reachable points `k` such that `k % b == r` are `dist[r], dist[r]+b, dist[r]+2b, ...`.\nTo count points in `[0, x]`: for each `r`, if `dist[r] <= x`, the number of such points is `floor((x - dist[r])/b) + 1`.\nThus, `f(x) = sum_{r=0}^{b-1} max(0, floor((x - dist[r])/b) + 1)`.\n\nNow we need to compute `S_M = sum_{i=0}^{M} f(i) = sum_{i=0}^{M} sum_{r=0}^{b-1} max(0, floor((i - dist[r])/b) + 1)`.\nWe can swap the summations: `S_M = sum_{r=0}^{b-1} sum_{i=0}^{M} max(0, floor((i - dist[r])/b) + 1)`.\nFor a fixed `r`, let `C_r(i) = max(0, floor((i - dist[r])/b) + 1)`.\nIf `i < dist[r]`, `C_r(i) = 0`.\nIf `i >= dist[r]`, `C_r(i) = (i - dist[r]) // b + 1`.\nSo the inner sum is `sum_{i=dist[r]}^{M} ((i - dist[r]) // b + 1)`.\nLet `k = i - dist[r]`. The sum becomes `sum_{k=0}^{M - dist[r]} (k // b + 1)`.\nLet `N = M - dist[r]`. We need to calculate `sum_{k=0}^{N} (k // b + 1)`.\nThis sum can be computed in `O(1)` time. Let `q = N // b` and `rem = N % b`.\nThe sum is `sum_{p=0}^{q-1} (p+1) * b + (q+1) * (rem + 1)`.\nThis simplifies to `b * q * (q+1) // 2 + (rem + 1) * (q + 1)`.\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1. Calculate `g = math.gcd(a, b)`.\n2. Set `a_prime = a // g`, `b_prime = b // g`.\n3. Set `m_prime = m // g`.\n4. Initialize `dist = [float('inf')] * b_prime`. `dist[0] = 0`.\n5. Run Dijkstra's algorithm to fill `dist` array. This takes `O(b_prime * log b_prime)` time.\n   `pq = [(0, 0)]`\n   While `pq` is not empty:\n     `d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)`\n     If `d > dist[u]`, continue.\n     `v = (u + a_prime) % b_prime`\n     `new_d = d + a_prime`\n     If `new_d < dist[v]`:\n       `dist[v] = new_d`\n       `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_d, v))`\n6. Calculate `total_sum_f_prime = sum_{k=0}^{m_prime} f'(k)`:\n   Initialize `total_sum_f_prime = 0`.\n   For `r` from `0` to `b_prime - 1`:\n     If `dist[r] > m_prime`, continue (no points for this `r` in `[0, m_prime]`).\n     `N = m_prime - dist[r]`.\n     `q = N // b_prime`.\n     `rem = N % b_prime`.\n     `sum_Cr = b_prime * q * (q + 1) // 2 + (rem + 1) * (q + 1)`.\n     `total_sum_f_prime += sum_Cr`.\n7. Calculate `f_prime_m_prime = f'(m_prime)`:\n   Initialize `f_prime_m_prime = 0`.\n   For `r` from `0` to `b_prime - 1`:\n     If `dist[r] <= m_prime`:\n       `f_prime_m_prime += (m_prime - dist[r]) // b_prime + 1`.\n8. The final answer is `g * total_sum_f_prime - (g - (m % g + 1)) * f_prime_m_prime`.\n\nConstraints: `m <= 10^9`, `a, b <= 10^5`.\n`b_prime` can be up to `10^5`. Dijkstra is efficient enough.\nThe sum calculations involve numbers up to `m_prime * b_prime`, which can be `(10^9/1) * 10^5 = 10^{14}`. `total_sum_f_prime` can be `b_prime * (m_prime^2 / b_prime) = m_prime^2`, which is `(10^9)^2 = 10^{18}`. Python integers handle large numbers automatically.\n\nExample 1: `m=7, a=5, b=3`\n1. `g = gcd(5, 3) = 1`.\n2. `a_prime = 5, b_prime = 3`.\n3. `m_prime = 7`.\n4. `dist = [inf, inf, inf]`, `dist[0] = 0`.\n5.

Let's recheck the formula for `sum_{i=0}^m f(i)`.\n`sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i) = sum_{i=0}^{m} f'(floor(i/g))`.\n`m_prime = m // g`.\n`m % g` is the remainder. `m_prime * g + (m % g) = m`.\nThe values `floor(i/g)` take on `0` for `i=0, ..., g-1`.\n`1` for `i=g, ..., 2g-1`.\n...\n`m_prime-1` for `i=(m_prime-1)g, ..., m_prime*g-1`.\n`m_prime` for `i=m_prime*g, ..., m`.\nNumber of terms for `f'(k)` is `g`.\nNumber of terms for `f'(m_prime)` is `m - m_prime*g + 1`.\nSo the sum is `g * sum_{k=0}^{m_prime-1} f'(k) + (m - m_prime*g + 1) * f'(m_prime)`.\nThis is equal to `g * (sum_{k=0}^{m_prime} f'(k)) - (g - (m - m_prime*g + 1)) * f'(m_prime)`.\nThis is `g * (sum_{k=0}^{m_prime} f'(k)) - (g - (m % g + 1)) * f'(m_prime)`. This formula is correct.\n\nLet's trace `f(i)` for `m=7, a=5, b=3`:\n`f(0) = f'(0)`: `r=0`: `(0-0)//3+1 = 1`. `r=1,2`: `dist` too big. `f'(0)=1`.\n`f(1) = f'(1)`: `r=0`: `(1-0)//3+1 = 1`. `f'(1)=1`.\n`f(2) = f'(2)`: `r=0`: `(2-0)//3+1 = 1`. `f'(2)=1`.\n`f(3) = f'(3)`: `r=0`: `(3-0)//3+1 = 2`. `f'(3)=2`.\n`f(4) = f'(4)`: `r=0`: `(4-0)//3+1 = 2`. `f'(4)=2`.\n`f(5) = f'(5)`: `r=0`: `(5-0)//3+1 = 2`. `r=2`: `(5-5)//3+1 = 1`. `f'(5)=2+1=3`.\n`f(6) = f'(6)`: `r=0`: `(6-0)//3+1 = 3`. `r=2`: `(6-5)//3+1 = 1`. `f'(6)=3+1=4`.\n`f(7) = f'(7)`: `r=0`: `(7-0)//3+1 = 3`. `r=2`: `(7-5)//3+1 = 1`. `f'(7)=3+1=4`.\n\nSum: `1+1+1+2+2+3+4+4 = 18`.\nThe example output is 19. What's wrong?\nAh, the example output is for `f(0)+...+f(7)`.

The example says `f(7)=8`.\nThis means my `dist[r]` approach is wrong for `f(x)`.\nThe `dist[r]` approach counts points `k` such that `k % b == r` that are reachable *from `0` staying non-negative*. This is not quite the same as staying in `[0, x]`.\nThe path `0 -> 5 -> 2` is valid for `x=5`.\nThe path `0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7` is valid for `x=7`.\nThe point `1` is reachable for `x=7` because `0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1`.\n`dist[1]=10` means the smallest reachable point `k` with `k%3=1` is `10`.\nBut `1` is reachable for `x=7`. This means `dist[r]` is not the minimum reachable point *within `[0, x]`*. It's the minimum non-negative reachable point.\n\nThe `dist[r]` approach is correct for finding all points `k` such that `k \\ge 0` and `k = p*a - q*b` for some `p, q \\ge 0`.\nThe set of points `\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}` for `f(7)` example:\n`0` is reachable.\n`5` is reachable (`0+5`).\n`2` is reachable (`5-3`).\n`7` is reachable (`2+5`).\n`4` is reachable (`7-3`).\n`1` is reachable (`4-3`).\n`3` is reachable (`0+5-3+5-3-3+5-3` no, `0+5-3+5-3 = 4`, `0+5-3+5-3+5-3 = 6`. `0+5-3+5-3+5-3+5-3 = 8`. `0+5-3+5-3+5-3+5-3+5-3 = 10`).\nThe points `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7` are all reachable except `3, 6`.\nWait, `3` is not reachable? `0+5-3 = 2`. `0+5-3+5-3 = 4`. `0+5-3+5-3+5-3 = 6`.\n`0+5 = 5`. `0+5+5 = 10`.\n`0-3` not allowed.\n`0`.\n`0+5=5`.\n`5-3=2`.\n`2+5=7`.\n`7-3=4`.\n`4-3=1`.\n`1+5=6`.\n`6-3=3`.\nSo `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7` are all reachable. `f(7)=8`. This matches the example.\n\nMy `dist[r]` values are `dist[0]=0, dist[1]=1, dist[2]=2`. These are the smallest non-negative values for each remainder.\nLet's re-run Dijkstra for `a=5, b=3`:\n`dist = [inf, inf, inf]`. `dist[0] = 0`.\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`.\n1.

This is correct for the problem definition of `dist[r]` (minimum `k` such that `k % b == r` and `k` is reachable staying non-negative).\n\nThe issue is that `f(x)` is defined by \"never jumps on an integer outside `[0, x]`\".\nThis means `dist[r]` should be calculated for each `x` separately.\nThe current `dist[r]` are global minimums, not constrained by `x`.\nFor example, to reach `1` for `f(7)`: `0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1`.\nAll intermediate points `5, 2, 7, 4, 1` are in `[0, 7]`.\n`dist[1]=1` (for `x=7`) is the minimum point with remainder `1`.\nBut for `x=5`, `f(5)=3` (points `0, 2, 5`). `1` is not reachable because `7` is not allowed.\nThis means `f(x)` is much more complicated. The `dist[r]` values depend on `x`.\n\nThis is a much harder problem than I initially thought. \"very easy question\" note is misleading.\nIf `f(x)` means \"all points `k` such that `k = p*a - q*b` for `p,q >= 0` and `0 <= k <= x`\", then the `dist[r]` approach is correct.\nHowever, the problem statement \"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\" means that the path must be valid.\n\nLet `S_x` be the set of reachable points for a given `x`.\n`0 \\in S_x`.\nIf `k \\in S_x`:\n  If `k+a <= x`, then `k+a \\in S_x`.\n  If `k-b >= 0`, then `k-b \\in S_x`.\nThis is a standard BFS on `[0, x]`.\nThe maximum reachable point is `x`. The number of states is `x+1`.\nMax `x` is `10^9`. BFS is too slow.\n\nThe problem states \"an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from 0\". This implies a BFS.\nThe example output for `f(7)` is `8`. This is `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7`. So all points are reachable.\nWhy is `f(5)=3`? `0, 2, 5`.\nPath for `0, 5, 2`: `0 -> 5`, `5 -> 2`. Max `x` is `5`.\nPath for `0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3`:\n`0 -> 5`. (in `[0,7]`)\n`5 -> 2`. (in `[0,7]`)\n`2 -> 7`. (in `[0,7]`)\n`7 -> 4`. (in `[0,7]`)\n`4 -> 1`. (in `[0,7]`)\n`1 -> 6`. (in `[0,7]`)\n`6 -> 3`. (in `[0,7]`)\nAll points `0..7` are reachable. `f(7)=8`.\n\nThe key constraint for the BFS is that `k+a` must be `<=x` AND `k-b` must be `>=0`.\nThis means the set of reachable points `S_x` is different for each `x`.\nHowever, the `dist[r]` array calculation is for the *unconstrained* problem (staying non-negative).\nThe `dist[r]` array is actually correct for the *minimum* value `k` such that `k \\pmod b = r` AND `k` is reachable from `0` by *any* sequence of `+a` and `-b` jumps, as long as all intermediate points are `\\ge 0`.\nIf `gcd(a, b) = 1`, then `dist[r]` is the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod b`.\nThis is exactly `r` itself if `r` is reachable.\nBut `r` is not necessarily reachable.\nFor `a=5, b=3`:\n`dist[0]=0`.\n`dist[1]=1`? No. `1` is `5-3-3+5-3`. `0->5->2->7->4->1`. The minimum `k` for `k%3=1` is `1`.\n`dist[2]=2`? No. `2` is `5-3`. The minimum `k` for `k%3=2` is `2`.\nThe Dijkstra I ran gave `dist = [0, 10, 5]`. This is for `+a` and `-b` movements, where `k-b` is allowed even if `k` was reached by `+a` jumps.\nThe interpretation of `dist[r]` as \"minimum value `k` such that `k % b == r` and `k` is reachable from `0` staying non-negative\" is standard for this type of Dijkstra on remainders.\nThe values `dist[r]` are the *smallest* non-negative values that can be formed as `p*a - q*b`.\nFor `a=5, b=3`, `gcd(5,3)=1`.\n`dist[0]=0`.\nTo get `k%3=1`: `1 = 2*5 - 3*3`. So `p=2, q=3`. `1` is reachable. `dist[1]=1`.\nTo get `k%3=2`: `2 = 1*5 - 1*3`. So `p=1, q=1`. `2` is reachable. `dist[2]=2`.\nSo `dist` should be `[0, 1, 2]`.\n\nWhy did my Dijkstra give `[0, 10, 5]`?\n`dist[u]` is the minimum number of `+a` jumps needed to reach `u` from `0` by only `+a` jumps, and then `k-b` jumps. No, this is wrong.\n`dist[u]` is minimum `k` such that `k % b = u`.\nLet's restart Dijkstra with `a=5, b=3`.\n`dist = [inf, inf, inf]`. `dist[0] = 0`.\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`.\n1. Pop `(0, 0)`.\n   `u=0`. `v=(0+5)%3 = 2`. `new_d=0+5=5`. `dist[2]=5`. `pq.heappush((5, 2))`.\n2. Pop `(5, 2)`.\n   `u=2`. `v=(2+5)%3 = 1`. `new_d=5+5=10`. `dist[1]=10`. `pq.heappush((10, 1))`.\n3. Pop `(10, 1)`.\n   `u=1`. `v=(1+5)%3 = 0`. `new_d=10+5=15`. `15 > dist[0] (0)`, skip.\n   This is the standard Dijkstra for `+a` jumps. It finds `k` by `k = X*a - Y*b`.\n   The `dist[r]` values are `0, 10, 5`. These are the minimum values reachable *by only adding `a`*.\n   This is incorrect. The point `1` is reachable from `0` by `0->5->2->7->4->1`.\n   The `dist[r]` should be the minimum `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod b` and `k` is reachable from `0` *without going negative*.\n   The graph for Dijkstra should have edges `u -> (u+a)%b` with weight `a` AND `u -> (u-b)%b` with weight `-b`.\n   No, that's not how it works. The state `u` is `k % b`.\n   If we are at `k`, we can jump to `k+a` or `k-b`.\n   The `dist[r]` values should be `0, 1, 2` for `a=5, b=3`.\n   `dist[0] = 0`.\n   `dist[1] = 1`.\n   `dist[2] = 2`.\n   The problem is that the Dijkstra finds the minimum `k` that is `\\equiv r \\pmod b` and can be reached by `+a` jumps. But we can also use `-b` jumps.\n   The `dist[r]` values are the minimum `k` such that `k \\ge 0`, `k \\equiv r \\pmod b`, and `k` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, *where intermediate points are not necessarily `\\ge 0`*.\n   If intermediate points must be `\\ge 0`, then the values `dist[r]` are `0, 1, ..., b-1` if `gcd(a,b)=1` and `a >= b`.\n   If `a < b`, some small values might be unreachable.\n   The set of reachable non-negative integers by `+a` and `-b` (staying non-negative) is generally not all multiples of `gcd(a,b)`.\n   It is a known result that if `gcd(a, b) = 1`, then all integers `k >= b(a-1)` can be expressed as `p*a - q*b` for `p,q >= 0`.\n   The smallest values `dist[r]` are indeed `0, 1, ..., b-1` if `a` is large enough compared to `b`.\n\nThe \"very easy\" note suggests that the `f(x)` calculation should be simpler.\nIt implies that the \"never jumps outside `[0, x]`\" constraint is either:\n1. Only applies to the final position `k`. (This is my initial interpretation).\n2. Or for large `x`, all multiples of `g` are reachable.\n\nLet's check the constraints on `x` one more time.\n\"if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`\".\nThis means all intermediate points `k_0, k_1, ..., k_N` must be in `[0, x]`.\nThis is a standard graph reachability problem.\nThe states are `0, 1, ..., x`.\nFrom `k`, edges to `k+a` (if `k+a <= x`) and `k-b` (if `k-b >= 0`).\nIf `x` is small, say `x <= 2*max(a,b)`, we can do a BFS.\n`max(a,b)` is `10^5`. So `x` up to `2*10^5` is fine.\n`m` can be `10^9`.\n\nWhat if `x` is large enough?\nIf `x >= a * b / gcd(a,b)` (roughly), then maybe all points `k * gcd(a,b)` are reachable?\nThis is related to the Frobenius coin problem.\nThe largest number not representable as `p*A + q*B` for `p,q >= 0` is `A*B - A - B`.\nHere we have `p*a - q*b`.\nIf `gcd(a,b) = 1`, then `dist[r]` is the minimum non-negative value `k` such that `k = p*a - q*b` for `p,q >= 0`.\nThis set of values is `\\{0, b, 2b, \\dots, (a-1)b\\}` modulo `a`. No, this is `\\pmod a`.\nThe `dist[r]` values from the Dijkstra with `a, b` (not `a', b'`) for `b` states are the minimum reachable points `k` such that `k \\pmod b = r`.\nFor `a=5, b=3`:\n`dist[0]=0`.\n`dist[1]=1`. (`1 = 2*5 - 3*3`).\n`dist[2]=2`. (`2 = 1*5 - 1*3`).\nThese are the minimum non-negative numbers `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod b` and `k = p*a - q*b` for some non-negative `p, q`.\nThis is the correct `dist[r]` array.\nMy Dijkstra implementation was wrong. The edge weight should be `a` and the state update should be `d+a`.\nThe states are `0, ..., b-1`. `dist[r]` is the minimum `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod b`.\nFrom `u`, we can reach `(u+a)%b` by adding `a`.\nFrom `u`, we can reach `(u-b)%b = u` by subtracting `b`.\nSo, if `k` is reachable and `k \\ge b`, then `k-b` is reachable.\nThis means for any `r`, if `dist[r]` is the minimum such `k`, then all `dist[r] + N*b` are reachable for `N \\ge 0`.\nThis is the standard problem. The Dijkstra formulation is correct.\nThe `dist[r]` values are `0, 1, ..., b-1` if `gcd(a,b)=1`.\nThis is because if `gcd(a,b)=1`, then `x*a + y*b = r` has a solution for any `r`.\nWe can choose `x, y` such that `x > 0` and `y < 0`. Then `x*a - (-y)*b = r`.\nSo `r` itself can be expressed as `p*a - q*b` for `p,q >= 0`.\nSo `dist[r]=r` for `r=0, ..., b-1`.\nThis makes the problem very easy.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a,b)`.\n`a_prime = a // g`, `b_prime = b // g`.\nThe `dist[r]` for `r \\in [0, b_prime-1]` should be `r`.\nLet's test this assumption.\nIf `dist[r]=r` for `r \\in [0, b_prime-1]`.\nThen `f'(X) = sum_{r=0}^{b_prime-1} max(0, (X - r) // b_prime + 1)`.\nAnd `sum_{k=0}^{M} f'(k) = sum_{r=0}^{b_prime-1} sum_{k=r}^{M} ((k-r)//b_prime + 1)`.\nLet `N_r = M-r`. Sum is `sum_{j=0}^{N_r} (j//b_prime + 1)`.\nThis is `b_prime * q_r * (q_r+1) // 2 + (rem_r+1) * (q_r+1)` where `q_r = N_r // b_prime` and `rem_r = N_r % b_prime`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `f(7)` with `dist[0]=0, dist[1]=1, dist[2]=2` for `a=5, b=3`.\n`f(0)=1`. `r=0`: `(0-0)//3+1=1`.\n`f(1)=1`. `r=0`: `(1-0)//3+1=1`.\n`f(2)=1`. `r=0`: `(2-0)//3+1=1`.\n`f(3)=2`. `r=0`: `(3-0)//3+1=2`. `r=1,2`: `dist` too big.\n`f(4)=2`. `r=0`: `(4-0)//3+1=2`.\n`f(5)=3`. `r=0`: `(5-0)//3+1=2`. `r=2`: `(5-2)//3+1=1`.\n`f(6)=4`. `r=0`: `(6-0)//3+1=3`. `r=2`: `(6-2)//3+1=1`.\n`f(7)=5`. `r=0`: `(7-0)//3+1=3`. `r=1`: `(7-1)//3+1=3`. `r=2`: `(7-2)//3+1=2`.\nThis is `3+3+2=8`. This matches the example for `f(7)`.\nThis means `dist[r]=r` assumption is correct.\nThe reason my Dijkstra was wrong is that the \"cost\" in Dijkstra `d` should be `k` itself, not `k/g`. And the update should be `min(dist[v], d+a)` and `min(dist[v], d-b)`. But this is a BFS not Dijkstra.\n\nThe actual Dijkstra for `dist[r]` values is:\n`dist[r]` = minimum `k` such that `k \\equiv r \\pmod b` and `k` is reachable.\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`\n`dist = [inf] * b`\n`dist[0] = 0`\nWhile `pq`:\n  `d, u = heapq.heappop(pq)`\n  If `d > dist[u]`, continue.\n  // Jump `+a`\n  `new_k_mod_b = (u + a) % b`\n  `new_k = d + a`\n  If `new_k < dist[new_k_mod_b]`:\n    `dist[new_k_mod_b] = new_k`\n    `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_k, new_k_mod_b))`\n  // Jump `-b`\n  `new_k_mod_b = (u - b) % b` (this is `u`)\n  `new_k = d - b`\n  If `new_k >= 0` and `new_k < dist[new_k_mod_b]`:\n    `dist[new_k_mod_b] = new_k`\n    `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_k, new_k_mod_b))`\nThis is still not right. The `dist[r]` is the smallest `k` for `k \\pmod b = r`.\nThe `+a` jump costs `a`. The `-b` jump effectively costs `0` (modulo `b`).\nSo the Dijkstra should have edges `u -> (u+a)%b` with weight `a`. This is what I did first.\nThe result `dist = [0, 10, 5]` for `a=5, b=3` is correct for that Dijkstra.\nHowever, the problem is that `k-b` is a valid jump. This means `k` can be reduced.\nThe `dist[r]` array should be computed in a different way.\nThis is a shortest path problem on a graph where nodes are `0, ..., b-1`.\nEdges: `(u, (u+a)%b)` with weight `a`.\nAnd `(u, (u-b)%b)` with weight `-b`.\nThe weight is the actual value. We want minimum value.\nThis is a Bellman-Ford type problem because of negative weights.\nBut we can use SPFA (Shortest Path Faster Algorithm), which is like Bellman-Ford but uses a queue.\nSince `b` is small (up to `10^5`), SPFA will work.\n`dist = [inf] * b_prime`\n`dist[0] = 0`\n`q = deque([0])`\n`in_queue = [False] * b_prime`\n`in_queue[0] = True`\nWhile `q`:\n  `u = q.popleft()`\n  `in_queue[u] = False`\n  // Try to relax neighbors\n  // Jump +a\n  `v = (u + a_prime) % b_prime`\n  `new_d = dist[u] + a_prime`\n  If `new_d < dist[v]`:\n    `dist[v] = new_d`\n    If not `in_queue[v]`:\n      `q.append(v)`\n      `in_queue[v] = True`\n  // Jump -b\n  `v = (u - b_prime) % b_prime` (which is `u`)\n  `new_d = dist[u] - b_prime`\n  If `new_d >= 0` and `new_d < dist[v]`:\n    `dist[v] = new_d`\n    If not `in_queue[v]`:\n      `q.append(v)`\n      `in_queue[v] = True`\nThis SPFA computes `dist[r]` as the minimum `k` for `k \\pmod{b_prime} = r`.\nFor `a_prime=5, b_prime=3`:\n`dist = [inf, inf, inf]`. `dist[0]=0`. `q=[0]`. `in_queue=[T,F,F]`.\n1.

So only `0` is reachable. `f(x)=1` for `x < 10^5`.\nThis implies the BFS is indeed the correct model.\nBut how to calculate `sum f(i)` for `m=10^9`?\n\nThe values `f(i)` are constant for ranges of `i`.\n`f(i)` changes only when `i` becomes a new reachable point.\nLet `R` be the set of all reachable points from `0` (staying non-negative).\n`R = \\{k \\mid k = p*a - q*b, p,q \\ge 0 \\}`.\nThis `R` is precisely `\\{k \\mid k \\ge 0, k \\equiv dist[r] \\pmod {b_prime} \\text{ for some } r \\text{ (after scaling by g)}\\}`.\nNo, `R` is precisely `\\{ k*g \\mid k \\in \\text{set of values computed by SPFA on } a', b' \\}`.\nSo `R = \\{k \\mid k \\text{ is a multiple of } g, k \\ge 0, \\text{ and } k/g \\ge dist[k/g \\pmod {b_prime}] \\text{ from SPFA}\\}$.\nThe `dist` values from SPFA correctly give `dist[r]` as the minimum reachable point `k` such that `k/g \\equiv r \\pmod {b_prime}`.\n\nThe issue is the constraint `k_j \\in [0, x]` for all intermediate steps `k_j`.\nThis means we can't just use `dist[r]` from SPFA.\nFor small `x`, `f(x)` can be computed by BFS.\nFor `x` large enough, `f(x)` should stabilize.\nWhat is \"large enough\"?\nIf `x >= max(a, b) * max(a, b)`?\nLet `MAX_K = max(a,b)`.\nThe reachable points are `0, a, 2a, ...`. And `0, b, 2b, ...`.\nBFS up to `2*a*b / g`?\nThe number of states in BFS can be `m`.\nThis is a typical competitive programming problem structure: small `m` allows `O(m)` or `O(m log m)`, large `m` requires `O(log m)` or `O(1)` per query or a formula.\nThe function `f(x)` has a \"periodicity\" for large `x`.\nThe values `f(i)` grow.\n`f(i)` is the number of points in `[0,i]` reachable by BFS.\nLet `limit = a+b`. If `x >= limit`, then from any reachable point `k`, we can always make `k+a` or `k-b` jumps without leaving `[0, x]` if `k` is not at the boundary.\nThe actual BFS limit is `max(a, b) * max(a, b) / gcd(a,b)`. This is roughly `10^5 * 10^5 = 10^{10}`. Still too large.\nThe limit for `dist[r]` to be useful is `a+b`.\nIf `x >= a+b-gcd(a,b)`, then any point `k` in `[0, x]` is reachable from `0` staying within `[0, x]` if `k` is a multiple of `gcd(a,b)`.\nThis is a known result for the coin problem.\nIf `x >= a+b-gcd(a,b)`, then `f(x) = x/g + 1`. (Assuming all `k*g` are reachable).\nFor `a=5, b=3, g=1`. `a+b-g = 5+3-1 = 7`.\nSo for `x >= 7`, `f(x) = x+1`.\n`f(7) = 7+1 = 8`. This matches example.\n`f(6)`: `6 < 7`. So `f(6)` needs BFS.\n`f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=1, f(4)=1, f(5)=3, f(6)=3`.\nThese values are computed by BFS up to `x=6`.\nThe sum `1+1+1+1+1+3+3+8 = 19`. This is the example output.\n\nSo the strategy is:\n1. Compute `g = gcd(a, b)`.\n2. Define `X_0 = a+b-g`. This is the threshold.\n3.

The BFS should be for a specific `x`.\n   The `f(i)` calculation must be for `x=i`.\n   We need to compute `f(0), f(1), ..., f(min(m, X_0))`.\n   Let `max_bfs_limit = min(m, X_0)`.\n   `f_arr = [0] * (max_bfs_limit + 1)`.\n   `reachable = {0}`.\n   `q = deque([0])`.\n   `current_max_reachable_val = 0`.\n   For `i` from `0` to `max_bfs_limit`:\n     While `q`:\n       `curr = q.popleft()`\n       `next_a = curr + a`\n       If `next_a <= i` and `next_a` not in `reachable`:\n         `reachable.add(next_a)`\n         `q.append(next_a)`\n       `next_b = curr - b`\n       If `next_b >= 0` and `next_b` not in `reachable`:\n         `reachable.add(next_b)`\n         `q.append(next_b)`\n     `f_arr[i] = len(reachable)`.\nThis BFS is wrong. `reachable` and `q` should be reset for each `i`. This is too slow.\n`X_0` can be `10^5+10^5-1 = 2*10^5-1`.\nA BFS for each `i` up to `2*10^5` is `2*10^5 * (2*10^5)` operations, too slow.\n\nThe correct way to update `f(i)` from `f(i-1)` is:\n`f(i) = f(i-1)` if `i` is not reachable.\n`f(i) = f(i-1) + 1` if `i` is reachable.\nBut the reachability of `i` depends on the interval `[0, i]`.\nThis is a standard problem: `f(x)` for reachable points in `[0, x]`.\nThis is solved by a single BFS.\n`reachable = [False] * (X_0 + 1)`.\n`q = deque([0])`.\n`reachable[0] = True`.\n`f_values = [0] * (X_0 + 1)`.\n`count = 1`.\n`f_values[0] = 1`.\nWhile `q`:\n  `curr = q.popleft()`\n  `next_a = curr + a`\n  If `next_a <= X_0` and not `reachable[next_a]`:\n    `reachable[next_a] = True`\n    `q.append(next_a)`\n    `count += 1`\n  `next_b = curr - b`\n  If `next_b >= 0` and not `reachable[next_b]`:\n    `reachable[next_b] = True`\n    `q.append(next_b)`\n    `count += 1`\nThis BFS finds all reachable points up to `X_0`.\nThen `f_values[i]` would be `sum_{j=0}^{i} reachable[j]`.

Still too slow.\n\nThe only way `f(x)` can be computed efficiently for `x` up to `X_0` is if `f(x)` is simply `f(x-1) + 1` if `x` is reachable, and `f(x-1)` otherwise.\nBut reachability depends on the current `x`.\nThe example `f(6)=3` (points `0,2,5`). `f(7)=8` (points `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7`).\n`6` is not reachable for `x=6`. But `6` is reachable for `x=7`.\nThis means the BFS must be run for each `i`.\n\nThis problem is a typical \"meet-in-the-middle\" or \"structural property\" problem.\nThe structural property `f(i) = i/g + 1` for `i >= X_0` is key.\nFor `i < X_0`, `f(i)` values must be computed.\nThe maximum value of `X_0 = a+b-g`.\n`a, b <= 10^5`. `g >= 1`. So `X_0` is at most `2 * 10^5 - 1`.\nWe need to calculate `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `X_0`.\nLet `dp[k]` be a boolean indicating if `k` is reachable.\n`dp[0] = True`.\n`q = deque([0])`.\n`f_arr = [0] * (X_0 + 1)`.\n`current_reachable_count = 1`.\n`f_arr[0] = 1`.\n`visited_for_bfs = [False] * (X_0 + 1)`.\n`visited_for_bfs[0] = True`.\n\nFor `i` from `1` to `X_0`:\n  `f_arr[i] = f_arr[i-1]`.\n  If `i` is reachable from `0` *staying within `[0,i]`*:\n    `f_arr[i] += 1`.\n  How to check if `i` is reachable staying within `[0,i]`?\n  This is the hard part.\n\nThe problem statement for `f(x)` is: \"an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from 0\".\nThis is just asking for the number of distinct integers `k` in `[0,x]` such that `k` is reachable from `0` using `+a` and `-b` jumps, where *all intermediate positions are also in `[0,x]`*.\nThis is a standard BFS on the graph `[0, x]`.\nThe values `f(i)` for `i=0..X_0` must be computed by a *single* BFS.\nLet `reachable_mask = [False] * (X_0 + 1)`.\n`q = deque([0])`.\n`reachable_mask[0] = True`.\n`f_values = [0] * (X_0 + 1)`.\n`f_values[0] = 1`.\n`current_max_reachable_point = 0`.\nWhile `q`:\n  `u = q.popleft()`.\n  `next_a = u + a`.\n  If `next_a <= X_0` and not `reachable_mask[next_a]`:\n    `reachable_mask[next_a] = True`.\n    `q.append(next_a)`.\n  `next_b = u - b`.\n  If `next_b >= 0` and not `reachable_mask[next_b]`:\n    `reachable_mask[next_b] = True`.\n    `q.append(next_b)`.\nAfter this BFS, `reachable_mask[k]` is true if `k` is reachable from `0` *staying within `[0, X_0]`*.\nThis is not `f(i)`.\n\nThe crucial observation from the example `f(7)=8` (all points `0..7` reachable) and `X_0=a+b-g=7`.\nFor `x >= X_0`, `f(x) = (x/g) + 1`.
