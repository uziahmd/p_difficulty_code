His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing Vasya's Olympiad Rank: A Competitive Programming Dilemma**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a fascinating competitive programming problem. My task is to figure out the best and worst-case ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad. I've got a handle on the setup: `n` participants, their first and second tour scores (`a` and `b` lists), and a minimum total score `x` for Vasya. Crucially, the assignment of scores from the two tours is *unspecified*, meaning I can strategically pair them to maximize or minimize Vasya's rank.\n\nMy intuition immediately screams \"optimization!\". To get the best possible rank, I need to make Vasya's score as high as I can while keeping everyone else's scores as low as possible.  I'm thinking, \"maximize Vasya's score\" by finding the largest possible scores from lists `a` and `b` that still satisfy the condition that Vasya's total is at least x. Then, for the remaining participants, it's a matter of minimizing the number of people who could potentially beat him. This sounds like an assignment problem in disguise!\n\nTo solidify my thinking, I have to consider the nuances of \"rank.\" Rank 1 is the best, rank `n` is the worst. We calculate rank by counting all people *strictly* above Vasya and adding one to that number to get Vasya's rank. We can count the rank from the perspective of people greater than or equal to Vasya - and that's the upper bound on the rank.\n\nThe best case calls for high scores for Vasya, while keeping the rest low.\nThe worst case, I'll need to minimize Vasya's score, and maximize all other scores.\nI'm zeroing in on a strategy: for the best rank, I want Vasya to take the largest possible scores. For the rest of the players, I want them to get their lowest possible sums! The 'jury's choice' part is important - it tells me that ties are permissible, and don't change the algorithm. Now I just need to write an efficient algorithm to implement this approach and handle all the edge cases properly! This is going to be fun.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in an Olympiad, given his minimum total score `x` and the lists of scores from the first (`a`) and second (`b`) tours for all `n` participants. We don't know which `a_i` belongs to which `b_j`, allowing us to form pairings freely.\n\n**Understanding Ranks:**\n*   A participant's rank is 1 + (number of participants with strictly higher scores).\n*   If there are ties, the jury can decide. This means:\n    *   **Best Rank:** If Vasya ties with others, he can be placed *ahead* of them. His best rank is 1 + (number of participants with strictly higher scores).\n    *   **Worst Rank:** If Vasya ties with others, he can be placed *behind* them. His worst rank is 1 + (number of participants with scores greater than or equal to his score, *excluding Vasya himself*).\n\n**Strategy for Best Rank:**\nTo achieve the best possible rank for Vasya, we want to maximize his score and minimize the scores of other participants.\n1.  **Maximize Vasya's Score:** Vasya should take the highest possible score from `a` and the highest possible score from `b` such that their sum is at least `x`. Let's say Vasya gets `a_i + b_j`. To make this as large as possible, we should sort `a` in descending order and `b` in descending order. Then, Vasya can pick `a[0]` and `b[0]`. Their sum `a[0] + b[0]` is the maximum possible total score any participant can get. If `a[0] + b[0] < x`, then Vasya cannot achieve this score. However, the problem guarantees `there are two integers i, j (1 <= i, j <= n) such, that ai + bj >= x`. So, Vasya can always achieve at least `x` points. The highest possible score Vasya can achieve is `max(a) + max(b)`.\n2.  **Minimize Other Participants' Scores:** After Vasya takes his two scores (say `a_v` and `b_v`), the remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` scores from `b` must be paired up. To minimize the chances of others beating Vasya, we should pair the remaining highest `a` scores with the remaining lowest `b` scores, and vice versa, to keep sums low.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach for the best rank exists due to the jury's choice:\nIf Vasya achieves a score `S`, and there are `k` other participants who also achieve score `S`, Vasya can be ranked 1st among them. His rank would then be 1 + (number of participants with scores strictly greater than `S`).\nTo maximize Vasya's score, he should take the highest `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. The largest possible sum any participant can achieve is `max(a) + max(b)`. Vasya can achieve this if `max(a) + max(b) >= x`. If he does, he will have the maximum possible score. Since ties can be broken in his favor, his best rank is **1**.\nThis is always possible: Vasya picks the largest `a_i` and largest `b_j`. Their sum `S = a_i + b_j` will be the maximum possible total score. If `S < x`, this scenario is invalid for Vasya. But the problem guarantees that *some* `a_i + b_j >= x`. So, Vasya can always achieve some score `S_V >= x`. If he picks `max(a)` and `max(b)`, his score `S_max = max(a) + max(b)` will be the highest possible. If `S_max >= x`, he can achieve this score. No one else can get a higher score. Thus, Vasya can be rank 1. If `S_max < x`, this implies that no participant can get `x` points, which contradicts the guarantee. So, Vasya can always achieve the maximum possible score `max(a) + max(b)` (if he is assigned these specific scores) and if this score is at least `x`, his best rank is 1. Since the problem guarantees *some* `a_i + b_j >= x`, this means Vasya can always achieve `max(a) + max(b)` (which is `a_i + b_j` for some `i, j`) and this score will be at least `x` if `max(a) + max(b) >= x`. The maximum possible score is `max(a) + max(b)`. If Vasya gets this score, no one can be strictly better than him. Thus, his best rank is 1.\n\n**Strategy for Worst Rank:**\nTo achieve the worst possible rank for Vasya, we want to minimize his score (while still being at least `x`) and maximize the scores of other participants.\n1.  **Minimize Vasya's Score:** Vasya should take `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j` is minimized, subject to `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n2.  **Maximize Other Participants' Scores:** For the remaining `n-1` participants, we want to pair their scores such that as many as possible get a score greater than or equal to Vasya's score. This means we should try to form `n-1` pairs with high sums. A common strategy for maximizing sums in pairings is to sort one list ascending and the other descending, then pair `a[i]` with `b[i]`. Or, to maximize the number of high sums, pair the largest `a` with largest `b`, second largest `a` with second largest `b`, etc.\n\nLet's formalize the worst rank:\nWe want to count how many participants can get a score *greater than or equal to* Vasya's score.\nThe key is realizing that we can choose *any* pairing of `a` and `b` scores for the `n` participants.\nTo maximize the number of participants who score `S_other >= S_Vasya`, we should sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. When we pair `a[i]` with `b[i]`, we are trying to create a diverse set of sums. The sum `a[i] + b[i]` will be one of the participant's scores.\nLet's analyze the `n` possible sums we can form by pairing `a_i` with `b_j`.\nSort `a` in ascending order: `a_0 <= a_1 <= ... <= a_{n-1}`.\nSort `b` in descending order: `b_0 >= b_1 >= ... >= b_{n-1}`.\nConsider the `n` pairs `(a_i, b_i)`. The sums `s_i = a_i + b_i` represent one possible set of scores for the `n` participants.\nWhy this pairing? This strategy is often used to maximize the number of pairs that meet a certain condition or to find a \"median-like\" pairing.\nIf we sort `a` ascending and `b` descending, and form pairs `(a[i], b[i])`, we get `n` sums.\nFor example, if `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [10, 20, 30]`.\nSorted `a`: `[1, 2, 3]`\nSorted `b` (desc): `[30, 20, 10]`\nPairs: `(1, 30) -> 31`, `(2, 20) -> 22`, `(3, 10) -> 13`.\nThis specific pairing allows us to determine how many participants *could* achieve a score of at least `x`.\nLet's count how many participants can achieve a total score of at least `x`.\nSort `a` in ascending order.\nSort `b` in descending order.\nUse two pointers, `i` for `a` (starting at 0) and `j` for `b` (starting at 0).\nIterate `i` from `0` to `n-1`. For each `a[i]`:\nWe want to find a `b[j]` such that `a[i] + b[j] >= x`.\nSince `b` is sorted descending, if `a[i] + b[j] >= x`, then `a[i] + b[k] >= x` for all `k < j`.\nTo maximize the number of participants with score `>= x`, we should try to use `b` values greedily.\nFor each `a[i]`, we try to pair it with the largest available `b[j]` such that `a[i] + b[j] >= x`.\nThis is a standard greedy approach for counting pairs that satisfy a sum condition.\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `b` in ascending order.\n3. Initialize `count = 0`.\n4. Use two pointers: `i` for `a` (starts at `0`), `j` for `b` (starts at `n-1`).\n5. While `i < n` and `j >= 0`:\n   If `a[i] + b[j] >= x`:\n     This pair `(a[i], b[j])` forms a sum of at least `x`. We use both `a[i]` and `b[j]`.\n     Increment `count`.\n     Increment `i` (move to next `a` score).\n     Decrement `j` (move to next `b` score, which is smaller).\n   Else (`a[i] + b[j] < x`):\n     Since `b[j]` is the largest available `b` score for `a[i]` to potentially meet `x`, and it failed, `a[i]` cannot be paired with any remaining `b` score to meet `x`.\n     So, `a[i]` must be paired with some other `b` score that will result in a sum less than `x`.\n     Increment `i` (move to next `a` score).\n\nThe `count` obtained by this greedy algorithm represents the maximum number of participants who can achieve a total score of at least `x`. Vasya is one of these `count` participants. Since the jury can place him last among ties, his worst rank will be `count`.\n\n**Example 2 Walkthrough (Worst Rank):**\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\n1.  Sort `a` ascending: `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n2.  Sort `b` ascending: `[0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n3.  `count = 0`\n4.  `i = 0` (pointing to `a[0]=3`), `j = 5` (pointing to `b[5]=8`)\n\n   *   `a[0] + b[5] = 3 + 8 = 11`. `11 >= 7`. Match! `count = 1`. `i = 1`, `j = 4`.\n   *   `a[1] + b[4] = 4 + 6 = 10`. `10 >= 7`. Match! `count = 2`. `i = 2`, `j = 3`.\n   *   `a[2] + b[3] = 4 + 4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. Match! `count = 3`. `i = 3`, `j = 2`.\n   *   `a[3] + b[2] = 4 + 4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. Match! `count = 4`. `i = 4`, `j = 1`.\n   *   `a[4] + b[1] = 5 + 3 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. Match! `count = 5`. `i = 5`, `j = 0`.\n   *   `a[5] + b[0] = 6 + 0 = 6`. `6 < 7`. No match for `a[5]` with `b[0]`. `i = 6`.\n5.  `i` is now `6`, which is not less than `n=6`. Loop terminates.\n\nThe final `count` is 5. This means 5 participants can achieve a score of at least 7. Vasya is one of them. In the worst case, he is ranked 5th.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n*   Best Rank: **1** (Vasya can always achieve the maximum possible score `max(a) + max(b)` which is guaranteed to be `>= x` in some configuration, and be placed first among ties).\n*   Worst Rank: The `count` calculated by the two-pointer greedy algorithm described above.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best rank: Vasya can always get 1st place.\n    # He can take the highest score from list 'a' and highest from list 'b'.\n    # This sum will be max(a) + max(b).\n    # The problem guarantees that there exist a_i, b_j such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n    # So, Vasya can always achieve a score >= x.\n    # If he takes max(a) and max(b), his score is max(a) + max(b).\n    # No one can get a strictly higher score.\n    # Since ties are broken by jury's choice, Vasya can be placed first.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst rank:\n    # We want to find the maximum number of participants who can achieve a total score of at least x.\n    # Vasya will be one of these participants.\n    # If k participants achieve a score >= x, Vasya's worst rank is k (if he's last among ties).\n    # To maximize this count, we sort 'a' in ascending order and 'b' in ascending order.\n    # Then we use a two-pointer approach.\n    # 'a_ptr' starts from the smallest 'a' score.\n    # 'b_ptr' starts from the largest 'b' score.\n    # If a[a_ptr] + b[b_ptr] >= x, we've found a pair that meets the condition.\n    # We count it, move to the next smallest 'a' and next largest 'b'.\n    # If a[a_ptr] + b[b_ptr] < x, then a[a_ptr] cannot be paired with any remaining b[k] (k <= b_ptr)\n    # to meet the condition (since b[b_ptr] is the largest available).\n    # So, a[a_ptr] must be paired with some b_k such that a[a_ptr] + b_k < x.\n    # In this case, we move to the next smallest 'a' (a_ptr + 1) to try to find a match for it.\n\n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n\n    count_at_least_x = 0\n    a_ptr = 0\n    b_ptr = n - 1\n\n    while a_ptr < n and b_ptr >= 0:\n        if a[a_ptr] + b[b_ptr] >= x:\n            # This pair (a[a_ptr], b[b_ptr]) can achieve a sum of at least x.\n            count_at_least_x += 1\n            a_ptr += 1  # Use this 'a' score\n            b_ptr -= 1  # Use this 'b' score\n        else:\n            # a[a_ptr] is too small to reach x even with the largest available b[b_ptr].\n            # So, a[a_ptr] cannot contribute to a sum >= x with any remaining b.\n            # We must move to the next 'a' score.\n            a_ptr += 1\n\n    worst_rank = count_at_least_x\n\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
