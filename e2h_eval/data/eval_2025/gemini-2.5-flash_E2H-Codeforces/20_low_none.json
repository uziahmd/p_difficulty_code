For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Understanding the Multiset Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Multiset of Strings\" problem. My goal is a Python solution, naturally.  Let me break this down in a way that makes sense, given what I know about these kinds of problems.\n\nThe core idea is working with binary strings, lengths 1 to *n*. We have these *c_s* values associated with each string *s*.  The challenge lies in creating this \"beautiful\" multiset. A beautiful multiset has a specific constraint: for every binary string *s* (length 1 to *n*), the count of strings in the multiset having *s* as a prefix can't exceed *c_s*.\n\nMy ultimate objective? Figure out how many *different* ways we can choose all those *c_s* values such that the *absolute* biggest size of a beautiful multiset is *precisely* equal to *f*.\n\nTo visualize this, I'm thinking about representing these strings as nodes in a binary tree. The root is the empty string, and each node has two children (0 and 1 appended).  Strings of length *n* are the leaves at depth *n*.  A multiset of strings becomes an assignment of counts to each leaf.\n\nNow, here's the crucial link:  If a string *s* has length *L < n*, it's a prefix of  2^(n-L) strings of length *n*. The \"beauty\" condition translates to the sum of counts of the strings in the multiset (length *n*) that have *s* as a prefix, being no greater than *c_s*.\n\nLet's introduce *N(s)*, the max number of strings with *s* as a prefix. If *s* is length *n*, then *N(s)* is simply *c_s*.  Crucially, for *s* of length *L < n*, *N(s)* is the sum of *N(s0)* and *N(s1)*. This is because any length-*n* string with *s* as a prefix must also have either *s0* or *s1* as a prefix. This *N(s) <= c_s* condition is a direct consequence of the beauty rule.\n\nSo, the core of the problem becomes this recursive relationship: for any *s* of length *L < n*, *N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)*, with the constraint *N(s) <= c_s* for all string lengths up to *n*. We want to *maximize* the total size of the multiset, which boils down to maximizing *N(\"\")*, where \"\" is the empty string.  Thinking ahead, I see potential for a dynamic programming approach. I'll define `dp[s]` to represent the maximum size of a multiset where *s* is a prefix.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers `c_s` (from `0` to `k`) for all binary strings `s` of length `1` to `n`, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of binary strings of length `n` is exactly `f`.\n\nLet `M` be a multiset of binary strings of length `n`. For any string `s` of length `L < n`, let `N(s, M)` be the number of strings in `M` that have `s` as a prefix. For `s` of length `n`, `N(s, M)` is the count of string `s` in `M`.\nA multiset `M` is beautiful if `N(s, M) <= c_s` for all `s` of length `1` to `n`.\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible size of `M`. This is `max_M sum_{s of length n} N(s, M)`.\nLet `max_size(s)` be the maximum possible sum `sum N(T, M)` where `T` ranges over all strings of length `n` that have `s` as a prefix, subject to the `c_x` constraints.\nIf `s` has length `n`, then `max_size(s) = c_s`.\nIf `s` has length `L < n`, then any string `T` of length `n` with prefix `s` must either have `s0` as a prefix or `s1` as a prefix. Thus, `max_size(s) = max_size(s0) + max_size(s1)`.\nHowever, we also have the constraint `max_size(s) <= c_s`. So, the actual maximum for `s` is `min(c_s, max_size(s0) + max_size(s1))`.\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `max_size(\"\")`, where `\"\"` is the empty string. If `n=0`, this would be `c_\"\"`. If `n > 0`, it is `min(c_\"\", max_size(\"0\") + max_size(\"1\"))`.\nThe problem statement says `c_s` is defined for `s` of length `1` to `n`. So, the root of our decision tree is `\"\"`. The maximum size is `max_size(\"0\") + max_size(\"1\")` (if we ignore `c_\"\"` which is not defined, or assume `c_\"\"` is effectively infinite).\nLet `dp[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s` values for all strings `s` of length `L` to `n` *rooted at some string of length `L-1`* such that the maximum total count for strings under this root is `val`.\nMore precisely, let `dp[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s` for all strings `s` of length `L` to `n` that are descendants of a fixed string of length `L-1`, such that the maximum possible sum of counts of length `n` strings under this string of length `L-1` is `val`.\n\nConsider a string `s` of length `L-1`. Its children are `s0` and `s1`.\nThe maximum count for `s0` is `v0`, and for `s1` is `v1`. The number of ways to achieve these counts are `dp[L][v0]` and `dp[L][v1]` respectively.\nThe maximum count for `s` is `min(c_s, v0 + v1)`.\nThe problem asks for `c_s` for `s` of length `1` to `n`.\nLet `dp[L][x]` be the number of ways to choose `c_t` for all strings `t` of length `L` to `n` that are descendants of a specific string `s` of length `L-1`, such that the maximum contribution from this subtree (i.e., `max_size(s)`) is `x`.\nThe base case is `L = n`. For a string `s` of length `n`, `max_size(s) = c_s`. We can choose `c_s` from `0` to `k`. So, for each `x` from `0` to `k`, there is 1 way to choose `c_s` such that `max_size(s) = x`.\n`dp[n][x] = 1` for `0 <= x <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\nNow, for `L` from `n-1` down to `1`:\nTo compute `dp[L][x]`, we consider a string `s` of length `L`.\nIts children are `s0` and `s1`, both of length `L+1`.\nLet `v0` be the `max_size(s0)` and `v1` be the `max_size(s1)`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `v0` is `dp[L+1][v0]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `v1` is `dp[L+1][v1]`.\nThe total ways to get `v0` and `v1` is `dp[L+1][v0] * dp[L+1][v1]`.\nThe maximum count for `s` is `min(c_s, v0 + v1)`.\nWe need to sum over all possible `v0, v1` and `c_s`.\n`dp[L][x] = sum_{v0, v1, c_s s.t. min(c_s, v0+v1) = x} (dp[L+1][v0] * dp[L+1][v1])`\nThe range for `v0, v1` is `0` to `k`. The range for `c_s` is `0` to `k`.\nThis sum can be broken down:\n`dp[L][x] = sum_{v0=0 to k} sum_{v1=0 to k} (dp[L+1][v0] * dp[L+1][v1]) * (count of c_s such that min(c_s, v0+v1) = x)`\n\nLet's analyze `(count of c_s such that min(c_s, v0+v1) = x)`:\n1. If `x < v0 + v1`: We need `c_s = x`. There is 1 such `c_s`.\n2. If `x = v0 + v1`: We need `c_s >= x`. The possible values for `c_s` are `x, x+1, ..., k`. There are `k - x + 1` such `c_s`.\n3. If `x > v0 + v1`: This case is impossible, as `min(c_s, v0+v1)` cannot be greater than `v0+v1`.\n\nSo, `dp[L][x] = sum_{v0=0 to k} sum_{v1=0 to k} (dp[L+1][v0] * dp[L+1][v1]) * (if x < v0+v1 then 1 else if x == v0+v1 then k-x+1 else 0)`\n\nLet `S[L+1][sum_val] = sum_{v0+v1 = sum_val} (dp[L+1][v0] * dp[L+1][v1])`.\nThis is a convolution. `S[L+1]` is the convolution of `dp[L+1]` with itself.\n`S[L+1][sum_val]` can be computed efficiently. The maximum `sum_val` is `2k`.\nThen, `dp[L][x] = sum_{sum_val=x+1 to 2k} S[L+1][sum_val] * 1 + sum_{sum_val=x to x} S[L+1][sum_val] * (k-x+1)`\n`dp[L][x] = (sum_{sum_val=x+1 to 2k} S[L+1][sum_val]) + S[L+1][x] * (k-x+1)`\n\nLet `P[L+1][y] = sum_{sum_val=y to 2k} S[L+1][sum_val]` be the suffix sum of `S[L+1]`.\nThen `dp[L][x] = P[L+1][x+1] + S[L+1][x] * (k-x+1)`.\nAll calculations are modulo `998244353`.\n\nThe maximum possible value for `x` (and `v0`, `v1`) is `k`.\nThe maximum possible value for `sum_val` is `2k`.\nThe maximum `f` is `2 * 10^5`. `k` is also `2 * 10^5`.\n`n` is small, `n <= 15`.\nThe total number of strings of length `1` to `n` is `2^(n+1) - 2`.\nThe number of strings of length `L` is `2^L`.\nThe final answer is `dp[1][f]`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.  Initialize `dp[n][x] = 1` for `0 <= x <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n2.  Iterate `L` from `n-1` down to `1`:\n    a.  Compute `S[L+1]`: `S[L+1][sum_val] = sum_{v0+v1=sum_val} (dp[L+1][v0] * dp[L+1][v1])`. This is a convolution. Max `sum_val` is `2k`.\n        `S[L+1]` has size `2k+1`.\n    b.  Compute `P[L+1]`: `P[L+1][y] = sum_{sum_val=y to 2k} S[L+1][sum_val]`. This is a suffix sum array.\n    c.  Compute `dp[L][x]` for `0 <= x <= k`: `dp[L][x] = (P[L+1][x+1] + S[L+1][x] * (k-x+1)) % MOD`.\n        (Note: `P[L+1][k+1]` should be 0 if `x=k`).\n        The `P[L+1][x+1]` term handles `sum_val > x`.\n        The `S[L+1][x] * (k-x+1)` term handles `sum_val = x`.\n3.  The final answer is `dp[1][f]`.\n\nConstraints: `n <= 15`, `k, f <= 2 * 10^5`.\nThe convolution step takes `O(k^2)` time if done naively. With FFT/NTT, it takes `O(k log k)`.\nSince `n` is small, `n * k^2` is too slow (`15 * (2*10^5)^2` is too much).\n`n * k log k` might be acceptable (`15 * 2*10^5 * log(2*10^5) approx 15 * 2*10^5 * 18 approx 5.4 * 10^7`).\nPython's default integer arithmetic and lack of built-in NTT makes this challenging.\n\nLet's check the maximum value of `x`.\n`dp[n][x]` is for `x <= k`.\n`S[n]` is for `sum_val <= 2k`.\n`dp[n-1][x]` is for `x <= k`.\n`S[n-1]` is for `sum_val <= 2k`.\n...\n`dp[1][x]` is for `x <= k`.\nThe `dp` arrays always have size `k+1`. The `S` arrays always have size `2k+1`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the `dp` state. `dp[L][x]` is the number of ways to assign `c_s` for strings `s` of length `L` to `n` that are *descendants of a particular string of length `L-1`*, such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset formed by strings of length `n` under that particular string of length `L-1` is `x`.\nThis means we compute `dp[L]` once for each `L`, and it applies to all `2^(L-1)` strings of length `L-1`. This is correct by symmetry.\n\nThe convolution `S[L+1][sum_val] = sum_{v0+v1 = sum_val} (dp[L+1][v0] * dp[L+1][v1])` can be computed by iterating `v0` from `0` to `k` and `v1` from `0` to `k`.\nThis is `O(k^2)`.\nTotal time: `n * O(k^2)`.\n`15 * (2 * 10^5)^2 = 15 * 4 * 10^10 = 6 * 10^11`, which is too slow.\n\nWe must use NTT/FFT for convolution. Python has no native NTT. We need to implement it or find a library.\nGiven the constraints and typical competitive programming environment, `n * k log k` is the expected complexity.\n\nA standard NTT implementation involves:\n-   `MOD = 998244353` (a prime of the form `c * 2^p + 1`)\n-   `PRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3` (a primitive root modulo `MOD`)\n-   Functions for `ntt(a, invert)` and `convolve(a, b)`.\n\nLet's implement NTT.\n`MOD = 998244353`\n`PRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3`\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_half = 1\n    while len_half < n:\n        wlen = pow(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (len_half * 2), MOD)\n        if invert:\n            wlen = pow(wlen, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, len_half * 2):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_half):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n        len_half *= 2\n    \n    if invert:\n        inv_n = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * inv_n) % MOD\n    return a\n\ndef convolve(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    # Find smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to result_len\n    fft_len = 1\n    while fft_len < result_len:\n        fft_len <<= 1\n    \n    # Pad a and b to fft_len\n    a_padded = list(a) + [0] * (fft_len - len_a)\n    b_padded = list(b) + [0] * (fft_len - len_b)\n    \n    # Perform NTT\n    fa = ntt(a_padded, False)\n    fb = ntt(b_padded, False)\n    \n    # Pointwise multiplication\n    for i in range(fft_len):\n        fa[i] = (fa[i] * fb[i]) % MOD\n    \n    # Inverse NTT\n    result = ntt(fa, True)\n    \n    return result[:result_len]\n\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[x] stores the number of ways to achieve max_size = x\n    # For L=n, max_size(s) = c_s. c_s can be 0 to k.
