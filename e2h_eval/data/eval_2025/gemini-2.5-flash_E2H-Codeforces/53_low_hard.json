Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Longest Repeated Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the longest substring that repeats at least twice within a given string.  It's all lowercase Latin letters, length between 1 and 100, which means brute force is likely the way to go. Here's my thought process:\n\n1.  **Iterate Through Possible Lengths:**  I need to check substrings of every length, from 1 up to the string's length minus one.  Starting from the longest possible and working down seems more efficient – the first repeat I find is the answer.  If no repeat is found, the answer is 0.\n\n2.  **Generate Substrings:** For each length I'll need to generate all the substrings of that length.\n\n3.  **Check for Repeats:** For each of these substrings, I'll need to check how many times it actually appears in the original string.  I need to make sure I'm correctly counting *overlapping* occurrences too. `str.count()` won't work perfectly for that.\n\n4.  **Track the Maximum:**  I'll keep the maximum length of any repeated substring.\n\nHere's how I envision the implementation:\n- Outer loop for length `L`, going from string length `n-1` down to 1.\n- Inner loop for the starting position `i` of a substring of length `L`.\n- Count occurrences of the substring from `i` using a custom function, because str.count will not account for the overlapped occurrences.\n\nLet's say `s` is the input string of length `n`.\n\nFor substring length `L`: I can start `i` from `0` to `n - L`. Then slice the substring, `sub = s[i: i+L]`.\nThen I want to count how many times `sub` appears in `s`. I can initialize `count = 0`. Iterate through `k` from `0` to `n - L`. If `s[k:k+L]` equals to `sub` then add the count.\nIf count is greater than or equals to 2, then `L` can be a potential answer. Then I will break the loops and start checking again with a different `L`.\nIf no length works, the answer is 0.\n\nThis sounds like a solid approach given the constraints. I think this should be a fairly efficient way to solve this. I just need to be careful with the overlap counting.\n",
