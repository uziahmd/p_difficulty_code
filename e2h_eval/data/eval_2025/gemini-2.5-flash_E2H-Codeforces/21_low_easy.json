The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Solving Strategy for \"Neko Finds Grapes\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Neko Finds Grapes\" problem, and my first thought is to break it down. We have `n` chests with numbers, `a_i`, and `m` keys with numbers, `b_j`.  The key thing is that a key unlocks a chest if their sum is odd – a bit of number theory there. It's essentially about parity: an even number plus an odd number is odd.  So, I need to figure out which keys can open which chests. Each key only opens one chest, and each chest is opened only once. The goal is clear: maximize the number of opened chests.\n\nSince the condition for unlocking is tied to odd sums, I'm thinking about the parity of the numbers. If `a_i + b_j` is odd, then one must be even, and the other must be odd.  This means an even chest needs an odd key, and an odd chest needs an even key. This is the crucial insight.\n\nI immediately see the need to count these groups. Let's create these four counts: the number of even and odd chests, and the number of even and odd keys. Call them `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`. Then, to get the maximum number of matches, I can pair even chests with odd keys or odd chests with even keys. The maximum for each pairing will be limited by the smaller of the two counts.  The optimal strategy is the sum of these two pairings. The total number of opened chests is the `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` (even chests with odd keys) plus `min(chests_odd, keys_even)` (odd chests with even keys).\n\nLooking at the example, I can see this in action.  I can quickly count the even/odd chests and keys, and then apply this strategy to calculate the answer. This feels like it should be very efficient to compute.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open. A chest `a_i` can be opened by a key `b_j` if their sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can open at most one chest, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that the sum of the chest number and the key number must be odd. Let's analyze the parities:\n*   If `a_i` is even and `b_j` is even, `a_i + b_j` is even. (Cannot unlock)\n*   If `a_i` is even and `b_j` is odd, `a_i + b_j` is odd. (Can unlock)\n*   If `a_i` is odd and `b_j` is even, `a_i + b_j` is odd. (Can unlock)\n*   If `a_i` is odd and `b_j` is odd, `a_i + b_j` is even. (Cannot unlock)\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that a key can unlock a chest if and only if the chest number and the key number have **different parities**. That is, an even chest can only be opened by an odd key, and an odd chest can only be opened by an even key.\n\nTo maximize the number of opened chests, we should count the number of even and odd chests, and even and odd keys separately.\n\nLet:\n*   `chests_even`: count of chests with even numbers.\n*   `chests_odd`: count of chests with odd numbers.\n*   `keys_even`: count of keys with even numbers.\n*   `keys_odd`: count of keys with odd numbers.\n\nNow, we can form two independent sets of matches:\n1.  **Even chests with Odd keys**: The maximum number of such matches is limited by the minimum of available even chests and available odd keys. This is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n2.  **Odd chests with Even keys**: Similarly, the maximum number of such matches is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince these two types of matches use different parities of chests and keys, they are completely independent. The total maximum number of chests opened will be the sum of the maximum matches from these two scenarios.\n\nTotal opened chests = `min(chests_even, keys_odd)` + `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_even = 0`, `chests_odd = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers. For each number, check its parity: if even, increment `chests_even`; if odd, increment `chests_odd`.\n4. Initialize `keys_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`.\n5. Read the `m` key numbers. For each number, check its parity: if even, increment `keys_even`; if odd, increment `keys_odd`.\n6. Calculate the result: `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7. Print the result.\n\nThis approach is efficient as it only requires a single pass through the chest numbers and a single pass through the key numbers, making its time complexity O(N + M).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # Max matches for even chests with odd keys\n    matches1 = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n\n    # Max matches for odd chests with even keys\n    matches2 = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n\n    print(matches1 + matches2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
