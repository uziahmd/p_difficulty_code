He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown & Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" The goal is to figure out a hidden string, 's', based on a jumbled set of its prefixes and suffixes. We're given the length of 's' (n) and a list of strings, each shorter than 's', but that represent prefixes and suffixes in some order. The tricky part is, for each possible length, there's *exactly* one prefix and one suffix.\n\nMy strategy? First, I'm going to zero in on the longest strings we're given, those with a length of n-1. There are only two of these.  One must be the prefix of 's' (truncated to n-1 characters), and the other must be the suffix of 's' (also truncated).\n\nI'll check if these two longest strings can fit together to make a possible 's'. To do this, I need to make sure the suffix of the potential prefix matches the prefix of the potential suffix. If they do, I've got a candidate 's'!  If the longest ones don't 'fit' (the suffixes and prefixes don't match), I will try the other way around.  I will then test the candidate to verify it is actually a valid solution and make sure that one of the prefixes and one of the suffixes has that length.\n\nOnce I've got a potential 's', I generate all its improper prefixes and suffixes. Then, I compare them with the input strings. If the two sets are the same, that potential 's' is the real one.\n\nAfter finding the string, the output is a string of 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix). For this, I'll need to go back through the original input, length by length, and mark which string for each length is a prefix and which a suffix. If it is the first occurrence of a length, and it matches the known prefix of that length, it gets a 'P', otherwise, an 'S'.  I need to make absolutely certain that I'm assigning either a 'P' or 'S' for both strings of the same length because of the problem requirements. There's a little edge case to watch out for: if the string has a repeating substring (like \"ababa\"), where the prefix of a certain length *is* equal to the suffix, I need to make sure I don't get confused assigning 'P' and 'S'. It is not important which order they are.\n\nThis seems like a solid plan.  I've double-checked my assumptions and the corner cases. I am confident I can write this code to generate the solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine which of the given `2n-2` strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are given that there are exactly two strings for each length from `1` to `n-1`, and that these strings are indeed the prefixes and suffixes of some `n`-length string.\n\nThe core idea is to reconstruct the original string `s` first. We can do this by focusing on the two strings of length `n-1`. These two strings must be `s[0:n-1]` (the prefix of length `n-1`) and `s[1:n]` (the suffix of length `n-1`).\n\nThere are two possibilities for how these two `n-1` length strings correspond to the prefix and suffix of `s`:\n\n1.  The first `n-1` length string (`str_A`) is `s[0:n-1]`, and the second (`str_B`) is `s[1:n]`.\n2.  The first `n-1` length string (`str_A`) is `s[1:n]`, and the second (`str_B`) is `s[0:n-1]`.\n\nLet's analyze Possibility 1:\nIf `str_A = s[0:n-1]` and `str_B = s[1:n]`:\n*   The full string `s` can be reconstructed as `str_A + str_B[-1]` (i.e., `s[0:n-1]` followed by `s[n-1]`).\n*   For this reconstruction to be valid, the suffix of `str_A` of length `n-2` must be equal to the prefix of `str_B` of length `n-2`. That is, `str_A[1:]` must be equal to `str_B[:-1]`. This checks if the common middle part `s[1:n-1]` is consistent.\n\nWe can apply the same logic for Possibility 2.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Read Input:**\n    *   Read `n`.\n    *   Store all `2n-2` input strings along with their original indices. This is crucial for printing the output in the correct order.\n    *   Organize the input strings by their length. A list of lists, `strings_by_length[k]`, can store all input strings of length `k`.\n\n2.  **Identify `n-1` length strings:**\n    *   From `strings_by_length[n-1]`, get the two strings. Let them be `str_A` and `str_B`.\n\n3.  **Form and Verify Candidate `s`:**\n    *   **Candidate 1:** Assume `str_A` is the prefix of length `n-1` and `str_B` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\n        *   Check consistency: `str_A[1:] == str_B[:-1]`.\n        *   If consistent, form `candidate_s1 = str_A + str_B[-1]`.\n        *   Generate all `n-1` prefixes and `n-1` suffixes for `candidate_s1`. Store them in a `collections.Counter` (frequency map).\n        *   Compare this `Counter` with a `Counter` of all the original `2n-2` input strings. If they match, `candidate_s1` is the correct `s`. Store it as `s_final` and proceed to step 4.\n    *   **Candidate 2:** If `s_final` was not found, assume `str_B` is the prefix of length `n-1` and `str_A` is the suffix of length `n-1`.\n        *   Check consistency: `str_B[1:] == str_A[:-1]`.\n        *   If consistent, form `candidate_s2 = str_B + str_A[-1]`.\n        *   Generate expected prefixes/suffixes for `candidate_s2` and compare with input strings using `Counter`, similar to Candidate 1. If they match, `candidate_s2` is `s_final`.\n\n    *   The problem guarantees that a consistent string `s` exists, so `s_final` will be found.\n\n4.  **Construct Output String:**\n    *   Initialize an answer list `ans` of `2n-2` characters with empty strings.\n    *   Create a boolean list `used_prefix_for_length` of size `n`. `used_prefix_for_length[k]` will be `True` if we have already assigned a 'P' to an input string of length `k`. This ensures that for each length `k`, exactly one string is marked 'P' and one 'S'.\n    *   Iterate through the `input_strings_with_indices` (preserving original order):\n        *   For each `(current_str, original_index)`:\n            *   Let `length = len(current_str)`.\n            *   If `current_str` is equal to `s_final[0:length]` (the canonical prefix of `s_final` of that length) AND `used_prefix_for_length[length]` is `False`:\n                *   Set `ans[original_index] = 'P'`.\n                *   Set `used_prefix_for_length[length] = True`.\n            *   Else:\n                *   Set `ans[original_index] = 'S'`.\n    *   Join the characters in `ans` and print the resulting string.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n = 5`\nInput strings (example order): `ba`, `a`, `abab`, `a`, `aba`, `baba`, `ab`, `aba`\n\n1.  `input_strings_with_indices = [('ba',0), ('a',1), ('abab',2), ('a',3), ('aba',4), ('baba',5), ('ab',6), ('aba',7)]`\n    `strings_by_length = [[], ['a','a'], ['ba','ab'], ['aba','aba'], ['abab','baba']]` (indices 0 to 4)\n\n2.  `str_A = strings_by_length[4][0] = 'abab'`\n    `str_B = strings_by_length[4][1] = 'baba'`\n\n3.  **Candidate 1:** Assume `str_A` ('abab') is prefix, `str_B` ('baba') is suffix.\n    *   Consistency: `str_A[1:]` (`'bab'`) == `str_B[:-1]` (`'bab'`). This is `True`.\n    *   `candidate_s1 = 'abab' + 'baba'[-1] = 'ababa'`.\n    *   Expected strings for `s=\"ababa\"`:\n        *   Length 1: `a`, `a`\n        *   Length 2: `ab`, `ba`\n        *   Length 3: `aba`, `aba`\n        *   Length 4: `abab`, `baba`\n        `Counter({'a':2, 'ab':1, 'ba':1, 'aba':2, 'abab':1, 'baba':1})`\n    *   Input strings: `Counter({'ba':1, 'a':2, 'abab':1, 'aba':2, 'baba':1, 'ab':1})`.\n    *   The Counters match! So `s_final = \"ababa\"`.\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    `ans = [''] * 8`\n    `used_prefix_for_length = [F,F,F,F,F]` (indices 0 to 4)\n\n    *   `('ba', 0)`: `len=2`. `'ba'` != `s_final[0:2]` (`'ab'`). `ans[0] = 'S'`.\n    *   `('a', 1)`: `len=1`. `'a'` == `s_final[0:1]` (`'a'`). `not used_prefix_for_length[1]`. `ans[1] = 'P'`, `used_prefix_for_length[1] = T`.\n    *   `('abab', 2)`: `len=4`. `'abab'` == `s_final[0:4]` (`'abab'`). `not used_prefix_for_length[4]`. `ans[2] = 'P'`, `used_prefix_for_length[4] = T`.\n    *   `('a', 3)`: `len=1`. `'a'` == `s_final[0:1]` (`'a'`). BUT `used_prefix_for_length[1]` is `T`. `ans[3] = 'S'`.\n    *   `('aba', 4)`: `len=3`. `'aba'` == `s_final[0:3]` (`'aba'`). `not used_prefix_for_length[3]`. `ans[4] = 'P'`, `used_prefix_for_length[3] = T`.\n    *   `('baba', 5)`: `len=4`. `'baba'` != `s_final[0:4]` (`'abab'`). `ans[5] = 'S'`.\n    *   `('ab', 6)`: `len=2`. `'ab'` == `s_final[0:2]` (`'ab'`). `not used_prefix_for_length[2]`. `ans[6] = 'P'`, `used_prefix_for_length[2] = T`.\n    *   `('aba', 7)`: `len=3`. `'aba'` == `s_final[0:3]` (`'aba'`). BUT `used_prefix_for_length[3]` is `T`. `ans[7] = 'S'`.\n\n    Final `ans` string: `\"SPPSPSPS\"`.
