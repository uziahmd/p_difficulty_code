            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break this down.**\n\nI'm tackling the \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem and my initial thought process is leading me towards a brute-force solution, which, given the constraint of R and B being <= 10, feels like a reasonable approach.\n\n**Problem Breakdown:**\n\nFirst things first, I immediately recognize that the number of Rebel spaceships (R) must equal the number of bases (B). If that's not the case, there's no way to form a perfect matching, and I can just output \"No.\"\n\n**Brute-Force Strategy:**\n\nSince R and B are small, I'm thinking a permutation-based approach makes sense. I'll iterate through all possible assignments of spaceships to bases.  That is, I'll generate all possible orderings (permutations) of the bases, and for each ordering, I'll check if the corresponding assignments (spaceship 1 to base 1, spaceship 2 to base 2, and so on) result in non-intersecting paths.\n\n**Geometric Considerations:**\n\nNow, the core of the problem is the non-intersecting path constraint.  This involves a geometric intersection test.  I'm well-versed in computational geometry, and the standard approach here is to check the relative orientation of line segments. I'll need to implement an efficient way to determine if two line segments intersect.\n\n**Intersection Test Implementation:**\n\nI'll use the cross-product, or more accurately, the *orientation* test, to determine if two segments intersect. The orientation function will tell me if a point is to the left, right, or on a line defined by two other points. If two segments, p1-p2 and p3-p4, intersect, then *p3* and *p4* must be on opposite sides of the line *p1-p2*, and *p1* and *p2* must be on opposite sides of *p3-p4*. \n\nCrucially, the problem states that the segments \"do not intersect in the galaxy plane,\" suggesting proper intersections (crossing). Shared endpoints are allowed.  The problem guarantees that no three points are collinear, which simplifies the intersection logic because I don't need to explicitly handle the case of collinear segments.\n\n**Edge Cases to Address:**\n\nI need to make sure my implementation handles the following:\n*   **Shared Endpoints:**  These don't count as intersections in this scenario.\n*   **Collinear Segments:** Should not occur.\n*   **One Endpoint on another Segment:** The `orientation` logic should implicitly handle this case as non-intersection.\n\nThis is a manageable problem, and I'm confident I can build an efficient solution by using a brute-force permutation approach combined with an optimized geometric intersection check based on the orientation test.\n",
