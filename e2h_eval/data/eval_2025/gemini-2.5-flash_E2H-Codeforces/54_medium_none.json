Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Python Script for Minimizing Angle Difference in a Regular Polygon**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The goal here is to write a Python script that takes a regular *n*-gon and a target angle *a* as input, and then finds three distinct vertices, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`, such that the angle formed at `v2` (i.e., `v1-v2-v3`) is as close as possible to the target angle *a*.\n\nFirst, I realize that since this is a regular *n*-gon, it can be inscribed in a circle, and all the vertices are equally spaced. This means the angles we can form are all related to the central angles subtended by the arcs connecting the vertices.  Specifically, the angle `v1-v2-v3` (where `v2` is the angle's vertex) is an *inscribed* angle, and its measure is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the arc `v1-v3` *not* containing `v2`.\n\nThe circle has 360 degrees, and since the polygon is regular, the angle between any two adjacent vertices at the center is `360/n` degrees.  So, the arc `v1-v3` can span some number *k* of these edges (or segments). This means the central angle is `k * (360/n)` degrees, and the inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` is half of that, or `k * (180/n)` degrees.\n\nI see a strategy emerging:  fix `v2` as some vertex (let's say vertex 1), then find `v1` and `v3` such that `k * (180/n)` is closest to the given angle *a*. *k* represents the number of segments on the arc not including `v2`, and since the vertices are distinct, *k* can take on values from 1 to *n-2*.\n\nTo find the best *k*, I can calculate the possible angles, `1 * (180/n)`, `2 * (180/n)`, ... `(n-2) * (180/n)`.  Then, I need to figure out which of these angles is closest to *a*.\n\nLet's call the 'base angle' `180/n`.  So the possible angles are just multiples of this base. I can calculate how many base angles are contained in the target angle *a*: `target_m = a * n / 180`. I need to then find the integer *m* which is closest to `target_m` such that 1 <= m <= n-2. I can check this by taking `floor(target_m)` and `ceil(target_m)`, finding the absolute difference, and taking the minimum of the two.\n\nNow, if I do this, it is easy to find which angle gives the smallest difference.  If the floating point is close to the cutoff between two integers, I will get two equally possible angles.  This is ok, since the problem states there can be many optimal solutions, and I only have to return one.\n\nOnce I have *m* and realize I need distinct vertices, I will take `v2 = 1`. I need to make sure to calculate `v3` as such that the arc contains `m` segments between vertices. If `v1=2`, then `v3=(1 + best_m) % n + 1`. This creates a set of vertices that will work for any `n` and *a* that may be given.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular convex n-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The vertices are numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\nAll vertices of a regular n-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` where `v2` is the vertex of the angle, is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\nLet the vertices of the n-gon be `P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_n`.\nIf we choose `v2` to be `P_k`, `v1` to be `P_i`, and `v3` to be `P_j` (where `i, j, k` are distinct), the angle `P_i P_k P_j` subtends the arc `P_i P_j` that does not contain `P_k`.\n\nThe total angle around the center of the circle is 360 degrees. Since the polygon is regular, the arc between any two adjacent vertices subtends a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\nIf the arc `P_i P_j` (not containing `P_k`) spans `m` segments (i.e., `m` edges of the polygon), then the central angle subtended by this arc is `m * (360/n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle `P_i P_k P_j` is half of this central angle: `(m * (360/n)) / 2 = m * (180/n)` degrees.\n\nThe number of segments `m` must be an integer. Since `v1, v2, v3` must be distinct, `m` must be at least 1.\nThe maximum possible `m` occurs when `v1` and `v3` are the vertices furthest apart from `v2` along the perimeter, without passing through `v2`. This means `v1` and `v3` are adjacent to `v2`'s 'antipode' (if `n` is even) or span almost the entire polygon perimeter. In a regular n-gon, the maximum number of segments an arc can span (without including `v2`) is `n-2`. For example, if `v2` is `P_1`, then `v1` could be `P_2` and `v3` could be `P_n`. The arc `P_2 P_n` (not containing `P_1`) spans `n-2` segments. The angle `P_2 P_1 P_n` is the internal angle of the regular n-gon, which is `(n-2) * (180/n)`.\n\nSo, the possible values for `m` are integers from `1` to `n-2`.\nThe possible angles that can be formed are `m * (180/n)` for `m \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n-2\\}`.\nLet `base_angle = 180.0 / n`. We are looking for an integer `m` in the range `[1, n-2]` that minimizes `|m * base_angle - a|`.\n\nTo find such `m`:\n1. Calculate the target `m` value: `target_m_float = a / base_angle = a * n / 180.0`.\n2. The integer `m` closest to `target_m_float` will be either `floor(target_m_float)` or `ceil(target_m_float)`. Let these be `m_floor = int(target_m_float)` and `m_ceil = m_floor + 1`.\n3. We need to consider `m_floor` and `m_ceil`, but only if they fall within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n4. Initialize `best_m = 1` and `min_diff = abs(1 * base_angle - a)`. This ensures we always have a valid `m` to start with, as `1` is always in `[1, n-2]` for `n >= 3`.\n5. Check `m_floor`: If `1 <= m_floor <= n-2`, calculate `current_diff = abs(m_floor * base_angle - a)`. If `current_diff < min_diff`, update `min_diff = current_diff` and `best_m = m_floor`.\n6. Check `m_ceil`: If `1 <= m_ceil <= n-2`, calculate `current_diff = abs(m_ceil * base_angle - a)`. If `current_diff < min_diff`, update `min_diff = current_diff` and `best_m = m_ceil`. (If `current_diff == min_diff`, we can keep the existing `best_m` as any optimal solution is fine).\n\nAfter finding the `best_m`, we need to output three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3`.\nA simple choice is to fix `v2 = 1`.\nThen `v1 = 2` (vertex adjacent to `v2`).\nFor the angle `v1-v2-v3` to span `best_m` segments, `v3` should be `best_m` segments away from `v1` (in the direction away from `v2`).\nIf `v2=1`, `v1=2`, then `v3` must be `2 + best_m - 1` positions away from `v2` (clockwise).\nSo `v3 = 1 + best_m`.\nWe need to adjust `v3` for 1-indexing and wrap-around: `v3 = (1 + best_m - 1) % n + 1`.\nHowever, a simpler way to ensure `v1, v2, v3` are distinct and form the desired angle:\nLet `v2 = 2`.\nLet `v1 = 1`.\nThen `v3` should be `2 + best_m`.\nAdjusting for 1-indexing and wrap-around: `v3 = (2 + best_m - 1 - 1) % n + 1 + 1`.\nThis simplifies to `v3 = (best_m) % n + 2`.\nFor example, if `n=4, best_m=2`: `v2=2, v1=1, v3=(2)%4+2 = 2+2=4`. Output `1 2 4`.\nThis angle `1-2-4` subtends arc `1-4` (not containing `2`), which spans `2` segments.\nThis choice of vertices `v1=1, v2=2, v3=(best_m % n) + 2` (adjusted to be `n` if `(best_m % n) + 2` becomes `2`) will always work for `n >= 3`.\nSpecifically, `v1=1`, `v2=2`. `v3` needs to be `best_m` steps away from `v1` (clockwise) *relative to v2*.\nThe arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) should have `best_m` edges.\nLet `v2 = 1`.\nLet `v1 = n`. (This is 1 step counter-clockwise from `v2`).\nLet `v3 = 1 + best_m`. (This is `best_m` steps clockwise from `v2`).\nVertices `n, 1, 1+best_m`.\nThese are distinct since `best_m >= 1` and `best_m <= n-2`.\nSo `1+best_m` will be between `2` and `n-1`.\nSo `n, 1, 1+best_m` are distinct.\nThe vertices are `v1=n`, `v2=1`, `v3=1+best_m`.\n\nExample 1: `n=3, a=15`\n`base_angle = 180/3 = 60`. `target_m_float = 15*3/180 = 0.25`.\n`m_floor=0, m_ceil=1`.\nInitialize `best_m=1`, `min_diff = abs(1*60 - 15) = 45`.\n`m_floor=0` is not in `[1, 3-2=1]`.\n`m_ceil=1` is in `[1, 1]`. `current_diff = abs(1*60 - 15) = 45`. Not less than `min_diff`.\n`best_m` remains `1`.\nOutput vertices: `v1=n=3, v2=1, v3=1+best_m = 1+1=2`. So `3 1 2`.\n(The example output `1 2 3` is also valid, forming a 60 degree angle.)\n\nExample 2: `n=4, a=67`\n`base_angle = 180/4 = 45`. `target_m_float = 67*4/180 = 1.488...`.\n`m_floor=1, m_ceil=2`.\nInitialize `best_m=1`, `min_diff = abs(1*45 - 67) = 22`.\n`m_floor=1` is in `[1, 4-2=2]`. `current_diff = abs(1*45 - 67) = 22`. Not less than `min_diff`.\n`m_ceil=2` is in `[1, 2]`. `current_diff = abs(2*45 - 67) = 23`. Not less than `min_diff`.\n`best_m` remains `1`.\nOutput vertices: `v1=n=4, v2=1, v3=1+best_m = 1+1=2`. So `4 1 2`.\n(The example output `2 1 3` is also valid, forming a 45 degree angle.)\n\nExample 3: `n=4, a=68`\n`base_angle = 180/4 = 45`. `target_m_float = 68*4/180 = 1.511...`.\n`m_floor=1, m_ceil=2`.\nInitialize `best_m=1`, `min_diff = abs(1*45 - 68) = 23`.\n`m_floor=1` is in `[1, 2]`. `current_diff = abs(1*45 - 68) = 23`. Not less than `min_diff`.\n`m_ceil=2` is in `[1, 2]`. `current_diff = abs(2*45 - 68) = 22`. This IS less than `min_diff`.\nUpdate `min_diff = 22`, `best_m = 2`.\nOutput vertices: `v1=n=4, v2=1, v3=1+best_m = 1+2=3`. So `4 1 3`.\n(The example output `4 1 2` is also valid, forming a 90 degree angle.)\n\nThe logic holds for all examples.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Calculate the base angle unit for a regular n-gon\n    # An inscribed angle is m * (180/n), where m is the number of edges on the subtended arc.\n    # m can range from 1 to n-2.\n    base_angle_unit = 180.0 / n\n\n    # We want to find an integer m (1 <= m <= n-2) such that m * base_angle_unit is closest to 'a'.\n    # This is equivalent to finding m closest to a / base_angle_unit.\n    target_m_float = a / base_angle_unit\n\n    # Consider the two integers closest to target_m_float\n    m_candidate1 = int(target_m_float)\n    m_candidate2 = m_candidate1 + 1\n\n    # Initialize best_m with the smallest possible valid m (which is 1)\n    # and its corresponding difference.\n    best_m = 1\n    min_abs_diff = abs(1 * base_angle_unit - a)\n\n    # Check m_candidate1 if it's within the valid range [1, n-2]\n    if 1 <= m_candidate1 <= n - 2:\n        current_abs_diff = abs(m_candidate1 * base_angle_unit - a)\n        if current_abs_diff < min_abs_diff:\n            min_abs_diff = current_abs_diff\n            best_m = m_candidate1\n\n    # Check m_candidate2 if it's within the valid range [1, n-2]\n    if 1 <= m_candidate2 <= n - 2:\n        current_abs_diff = abs(m_candidate2 * base_angle_unit - a)\n        # If current_abs_diff is strictly smaller, update.\n        # If it's equal, we stick with the existing best_m (any optimal solution is fine).\n        if current_abs_diff < min_abs_diff:\n            min_abs_diff = current_abs_diff\n            best_m = m_candidate2\n\n    # Construct the vertices.\n    # We can fix v2 = 1.\n    # For v1, pick n (adjacent to 1, clockwise when going from n to 1).\n    # For v3, pick 1 + best_m (best_m steps clockwise from 1).\n    # This ensures v1, v2, v3 are distinct because:\n    # v2 = 1\n    # v1 = n (n != 1 as n >= 3)\n    # v3 = 1 + best_m.
