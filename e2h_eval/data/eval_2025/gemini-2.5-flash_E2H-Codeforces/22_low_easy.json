After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Let's Get This Marks Problem Solved!**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to tackle this \"Marks\" problem.  It's a classic: figure out who's \"best\" in at least one subject and count them.  Thinking through the steps, it seems pretty straightforward given my experience.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. There are *n* students and *m* subjects, with marks from 1 to 9. A student is \"best\" if no one else scored higher in a specific subject.  A \"successful\" student is best in *at least one* subject, and my goal is to count those successful students.\n\nI'm getting that I need to parse the input: the first line has the *n* and *m* values, and the following *n* lines represent the marks for each student in all subjects.  Each mark will be a single digit character.\n\nThe constraints are pretty reasonable: both *n* and *m* are capped at 100.  That's well within what I'm used to handling with Python, performance-wise.\n\nI walked through that example, which helps clarify the logic. The key seems to be examining each subject column-by-column, finding the maximum mark in each subject and then comparing that to each student's mark for that subject. If a student matches the maximum, they are considered \"best\" for that subject.\n\nTo put this into an algorithm, I'm thinking:\n\n1.  Read *n* and *m*. Easy enough.\n2.  Read the gradebook data: I can use a list of strings, `gradebook`, where `gradebook[i]` will hold a string of the marks for student *i*. It seems efficient to use strings since the input consists of string characters.\n3.  Then, for each subject, I'll iterate through it and determine the maximum mark and identify which students match it. I'll need a list or a set to keep track of the successful students.  Probably a set is best to avoid duplicates.\n4. Finally, I'll just return the number of elements in my \"successful\" set. This gives me my final answer.\n\nI'm confident I can whip up a neat and concise script to solve this! This will be simple. Time to code!\n",
