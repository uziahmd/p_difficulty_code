You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Replacing Digits Problem: A Python Script Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to tackle this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. Let's break down my thought process. The core of this challenge seems to be maximizing the value of a number, `a`, by replacing its digits with digits from a sequence, `s`.  Each digit from `s` is single-use, and the aim is to get the largest possible number.\n\nFirst, understanding the problem. I'm given two strings: `a`, the number to optimize, and `s`, the pool of replacement digits. I can swap a digit in `a` with a digit from `s`, but each digit in `s` can be used only once. The order of digits *must* be maintained in `a`. To maximize a number, the leading (leftmost) digits have the highest weight, hence they need the biggest digits.\n\nMy strategy?  Iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right. For each digit, I'll search for the largest available digit from `s` that's *larger* than the current digit in `a`. If no such digit exists, or if the substitution doesn't increase the number, I leave it as is.\n\nNow, let's refine this strategy for implementation.  I should convert `a` to a list of characters for easier modification. And to efficiently find the largest available digit, I should sort `s` in descending order. This ensures I'm always picking the largest unused digit first.\n\nHere's the detailed algorithm:\n1.  Read `a` and `s` as strings.\n2.  Convert `a` into a list of characters, `a_list`.\n3.  Do the same for `s`, creating `s_list`.\n4.  Sort `s_list` in descending order. This pre-sort makes it easy to find that optimal next digit quickly.\n5.  Initialize `s_ptr` to 0. This index points to the current largest available replacement from `s_list`.\n6.  Iterate through `a_list`:\n    a. Check `s_ptr < len(s_list)`: is there a usable digit in `s`?\n    b. If there is: Compare the current digit of `a_list` with `s_list[s_ptr]`.\n    c. If `s_list[s_ptr]` is greater: Replace the digit in `a_list` with `s_list[s_ptr]`, and increment `s_ptr` to reflect usage.  Otherwise, do not replace.\n7.  Finally, join `a_list` back into a string and return it.\n\nThis approach should give me the maximum possible value for `a` after the digit replacements, all within the constraints of the problem.
