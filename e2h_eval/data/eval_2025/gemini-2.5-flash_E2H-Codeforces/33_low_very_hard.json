You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing a Number Through Strategic Digit Replacement**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Replacing Digits\" problem, and the goal is clear: maximize the value of the number `a` by strategically replacing its digits with digits from the sequence `s`.  The key to maximizing a number is to get those leftmost, most significant digits as large as possible.  That's my primary focus.\n\nThe constraints are also pretty straightforward: I can only use each digit from `s` once, and I don't *have* to use all of them. Also, I don't have to worry about creating leading zeroes because the original number doesn't have leading zeroes, and replacing a digit won't create a leading zero (unless I replace a non-zero digit with zero, which is against my goal anyway).\n\nMy strategy then is this: I'll iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right. For each digit in `a`, I'll check if I can replace it with a larger digit from `s`. I want to prioritize the *largest* potential replacements from `s` first. That means I need to sort `s` in descending order, so the biggest digits are at the beginning.\n\nHere's how I envision the algorithm: I'll convert `a` into a list so I can modify it. I'll sort `s` descendingly. Then, I'll have a pointer to keep track of my current position in the sorted `s`. I'll iterate through `a`:\n\n*   For each digit in `a`, I'll compare it to the digits in my sorted `s`.\n*   If I find a digit in `s` that's *greater* than the current digit in `a`, I'll make the replacement, move the `s` pointer ahead to avoid using that digit again, and move on to the next digit in `a`.\n*   If I *don't* find a larger digit in `s`, I keep the original digit from `a`.\n\nIt's tempting to stop looking in `s` as soon as I hit a digit that's *smaller* or equal to the current digit in `a`. But I *must* keep that digit in `s` in case it helps later. For example, `a` could be \"10\" and `s` could be \"90\". If the algorithm stopped immediately when it sees '0' in `s`, it would fail to replace the '0' with '9'.\n\nEffectively, I'm doing a greedy search for the *best* replacement at each position in `a`, always striving to increase the number as much as possible, with the added caveat that I can't use the same digit from `s` twice. This approach should result in the largest possible number I can create.\n",
