Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Diving into the \"TV Game\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"TV Game\" problem staring me in the face. It's a classic competitive programming challenge.  Let me break down what I'm dealing with. I need a Python script to solve it.\n\n**Problem Breakdown:**  Two players, Homer and Marge. A number, *A*, with `2n` digits.  Each player takes turns selecting the leftmost digit of *A* and appending it to their running sum, `S1` (Homer) and `S2` (Marge). They each get `n` turns. The objective is to maximize the total sum, `S1 + S2`. The output should be a string representing the sequence of 'H' and 'M' moves.\n\n**Constraints are Key:** The size of *A* is limited: `1 <= n <= 18`. This is important, as it gives me some bounds on the complexity of possible solutions. *A* can have leading zeros.\n\n**Thinking Through the Example:** The example with `n=2` and `A=\"1234\"` is helpful.  I've sketched out the different move sequences and their corresponding sums. \"HHMM\" clearly yields the highest sum (46) compared to \"HMHM\" or \"HMMH\".\n\n**Initial Approach: The Brute Force Trap?**  My immediate thought is to try all possible sequences. There are `C(2n, n)` ways to arrange `n` 'H's and `n` 'M's. For `n=18`, that number is incredibly large - over 9 billion! Brute force is a dead end.\n\n**Time for a More Sophisticated Strategy:** Dynamic programming seems plausible, but with the constraints, might not be efficient enough.  I'm leaning towards a Meet-in-the-Middle approach.  The small value of `n` strongly suggests this.\n\n**Meet-in-the-Middle:  Splitting the Problem:**  The idea is to split the `2n` moves into two halves, each with `n` moves. I could precalculate sums of all possible move combinations in the first `n` moves (e.g. `k` Homer moves) and then try to find an optimal match from the remaining `n` moves to maximize the sum. If the move sequence is represented by how many 'H's are at the first half. The optimal choice should be at the middle when `k` is at `n`. This is likely to be much faster than full enumeration. This is a very promising avenue.\n",
