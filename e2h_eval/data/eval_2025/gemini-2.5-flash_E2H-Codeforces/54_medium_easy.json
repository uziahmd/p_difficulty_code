Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Quest for the Perfect Angle**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem: find three points on a regular polygon that make an angle as close as possible to some given target angle.  I started by remembering some geometry:  inscribed angles are half the central angle that subtends the same arc.  That means the angle I'm after is determined by how many \"sides\" of the polygon are between the points forming the angle.\n\nLet's nail down the variables. Number the vertices from 1 to *n*. It doesn't really matter which vertex is which; the polygon's symmetry makes this all relative. Let's fix vertex 2 as the corner of our angle, and 1 and 3 are going to form the \"sides.\"  The crucial thing here is the number of sides *not* including vertex 2, the number between the points 1 and 3. I'll call this `k`.  This is `k` in steps.\n\nSo, the angle is going to be `k * 180 / n`.  The distance between vertices 1 and 3, when 1 and 2 are fixed, is this variable `k`.  I need to find a `k` that minimizes the absolute difference between `k * 180 / n` and my target angle *a*.  Simple enough.\n\nNow, `k` can range from 1 to *n-2*. If `k` is *n-1*, then I have a triangle where one leg is the diameter of the circumcircle. But this is not valid, because vertices must be distinct. Now, I need to come up with some `k` values, and check which one is the closest.\n\nLet's convert it to code-speak: `angle_unit = 180 / n`. We're looking for an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` that minimizes `|k * angle_unit - a|`.  Or, to put it differently: find the integer `k` that's closest to `a / angle_unit`.  Let's call `a / angle_unit` which is `a * n / 180` target. I need to get the `target_k`, which is just this value rounded to the nearest integer. Easy! I can use `round()`.\n\nOkay, what's next? After some thought, I came up with a final check to make sure my `k` is in a reasonable range. The `k`s are between 1 and *n-2*, inclusive. So my final optimized solution would be `best_k = max(1, min(n-2, round(a * n / 180.0)))`.\n\nNow, the final touch, I just plug that into the output of the vertices, and I have found the solution to the problem. The correct way to represent vertices is to get the correct positions from `k`. In terms of the vertices, I have selected the coordinates of the first and the second vertices as 2 and 1. The vertices could then be represented as `v2=1`, `v1=2`, `v3 = (2 + best_k)`.  If that index is out of bounds, I should modulo the result. That covers all my bases, and I'm ready to code!\n\nI retested the logic and edge cases a number of times. I went over a few example cases to find what I was missing.  All good, ready to go.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` is as close as possible to a given angle `a`.\n\nAll vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` where `v2` is the vertex of the angle is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\nLet the vertices of the `n`-gon be `P_1, P_2, ..., P_n` in clockwise order.\nIf we choose `v2` to be `P_x`, `v1` to be `P_y`, and `v3` to be `P_z`, the angle `P_y P_x P_z` depends on the number of edges along the perimeter between `P_y` and `P_z` *without passing through `P_x`*.\nLet `k` be the number of edges between `P_y` and `P_z` along the shorter arc. The central angle subtended by this arc is `k * (360 / n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle `P_y P_x P_z` is half of this central angle, so it is `k * (360 / n) / 2 = k * (180 / n)` degrees.\n\nThe number of edges `k` can range from `1` to `n-2`.\n- `k=1`: The angle is `1 * (180 / n)`. This occurs when `v1` and `v3` are adjacent to each other, and `v2` is any other vertex. For example, `P_1 P_3 P_2` forms an angle of `1 * (180/n)`.\n- `k=n-2`: The angle is `(n-2) * (180 / n)`. This is the internal angle of a regular `n`-gon. This occurs when `v1` and `v3` are adjacent to `v2` (e.g., `P_1 P_2 P_3`).\n\nSo, the possible angles that can be formed are `1 * (180 / n), 2 * (180 / n), ..., (n-2) * (180 / n)`.\nOur goal is to find an integer `k` (where `1 <= k <= n-2`) such that `|k * (180 / n) - a|` is minimized.\n\nLet `angle_unit = 180.0 / n`. The possible angles are `k * angle_unit`.\nWe want to minimize `|k * angle_unit - a|`, which is equivalent to minimizing `|k - a / angle_unit|`.\nLet `target_k_float = a / angle_unit = a * n / 180.0`.\nWe need to find an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` that is closest to `target_k_float`.\n\nThe integer `k` closest to `target_k_float` can be found by rounding `target_k_float`. Let `k_rounded = round(target_k_float)`.\nHowever, `k_rounded` might be outside the valid range `[1, n-2]`. So we must clamp it:\n`best_k = max(1, min(n-2, k_rounded))`.\n\nOnce `best_k` is determined, we need to output three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3`.\nWe can fix `v2` and `v1` to simplify vertex selection.\nLet's use 1-based indexing for vertices `1, 2, ..., n`.\n1. Choose `v2 = 1`.\n2. Choose `v1 = 2`. (This means `v1` is one step clockwise from `v2`).\n3. To form an angle `v1-v2-v3` that subtends `best_k` edges, `v3` must be `best_k` steps clockwise from `v1`.\n   So, `v3 = (v1 + best_k - 1)`.\n   If `v3` exceeds `n`, we wrap it around: `v3 = (v1 + best_k - 1 - 1) % n + 1`.\n   A simpler way to write this: `v3 = (2 + best_k - 1 - 1) % n + 1`.\n   Let's check indices `0, ..., n-1`:\n   `v2_idx = 0`\n   `v1_idx = 1`\n   `v3_idx = (1 + best_k) % n`\n   Since `1 <= best_k <= n-2`, `1 + best_k` will be in `[2, n-1]`.\n   Thus, `v3_idx` will be in `[2, n-1]`.\n   So `v1_idx`, `v2_idx`, `v3_idx` will be `1, 0, (1+best_k)`. These are always distinct.\n   Converting back to 1-based indexing:\n   `v2 = 0 + 1 = 1`\n   `v1 = 1 + 1 = 2`\n   `v3 = (1 + best_k) + 1`.\n   \nLet's test this with the examples:\n- `n=3, a=15`:\n  `target_k_float = 15 * 3 / 180.0 = 0.25`. `round(0.25) = 0`.\n  `best_k = max(1, min(3-2, 0)) = max(1, min(1, 0)) = max(1, 0) = 1`.\n  Output: `v1=2, v2=1, v3=(1+1)+1 = 3`. So `2 1 3`. (Matches example output `1 2 3` in value, valid).\n- `n=4, a=67`:\n  `target_k_float = 67 * 4 / 180.0 = 1.488...`. `round(1.488...) = 1`.\n  `best_k = max(1, min(4-2, 1)) = max(1, min(2, 1)) = max(1, 1) = 1`.\n  Output: `v1=2, v2=1, v3=(1+1)+1 = 3`. So `2 1 3`. (Matches example output).\n- `n=4, a=68`:\n  `target_k_float = 68 * 4 / 180.0 = 1.511...`. `round(1.511...) = 2`.\n  `best_k = max(1, min(4-2, 2)) = max(1, min(2, 2)) = max(1, 2) = 2`.\n  Output: `v1=2, v2=1, v3=(1+2)+1 = 4`. So `2 1 4`. (Matches example output `4 1 2` in value, valid).\n\nThis approach using `round()` and clamping is simple and correct because the problem allows \"any optimal solution\". Python's `round()` function rounds ties to the nearest even integer, but for this problem, either choice in a tie is acceptable.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # The unit angle formed by two adjacent vertices and a third vertex\n    # (e.g., angle P1 P_k P2) is 180/n degrees.\n    # An angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, v3 (where v2 is the vertex)\n    # subtends an arc of k segments, so its measure is k * (180/n) degrees.\n    # k can range from 1 to n-2.\n\n    # We want to find k such that |k * (180/n) - a| is minimized.\n    # This is equivalent to minimizing |k - a / (180/n)|\n    # Let target_k_float = a / (180/n) = a * n / 180.0\n\n    target_k_float = a * n / 180.0\n\n    # The closest integer k to target_k_float\n    # Python's round() function rounds to the nearest even number for ties (e.g., round(2.5) is 2, round(3.5) is 4).\n    # For this problem, any optimal solution is fine, so this rounding is acceptable.\n    k_rounded = round(target_k_float)\n\n    # Clamp k to the valid range [1, n-2]\n    best_k = max(1, min(n - 2, int(k_rounded)))\n\n    # Output vertices v1, v2, v3.\n    # We can fix v2 = 1, v1 = 2.\n    # Then v3 must be chosen such that the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2)\n    # spans 'best_k' segments.\n    # If v2 is vertex 1, v1 is vertex 2, then v3 should be vertex (2 + best_k).\n    # We need to adjust for 1-based indexing and wrap around if it exceeds n.\n    # v1 = 2\n    # v2 = 1\n    # v3 = (1 + best_k) + 1  (using 0-based indices 0, 1, ..., n-1 for calculation, then convert to 1-based)\n    # The 0-based indices would be: v2_idx=0, v1_idx=1, v3_idx=(1+best_k)\n    # Since 1 <= best_k <= n-2, v3_idx will be in [2, n-1].\n    # So v1_idx, v2_idx, v3_idx are always distinct.\n    \n    v1 = 2\n    v2 = 1\n    v3 = (1 + best_k) + 1 # Convert 0-based index (1+best_k) to 1-based\n\n    print(v1, v2, v3)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
