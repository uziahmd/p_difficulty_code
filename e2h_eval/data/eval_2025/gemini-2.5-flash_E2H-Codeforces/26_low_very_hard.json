Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Count Triangles\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got the \"Count Triangles\" problem in my sights. The core challenge is pretty clear: find all the possible integer side combinations (x, y, z) that form non-degenerate triangles, given the constraints on the ranges of each side.  Let's break this down.\n\nThe problem gives me four integers, A, B, C, and D, and the ranges for sides x, y, and z are A to B, B to C, and C to D, respectively.  The real key is the triangle inequality.  It has to satisfy three conditions: x + y > z, x + z > y, and y + z > x.\n\nNow, let's analyze those inequalities.  After some thought, I realize that two of those inequalities are always satisfied. Since x is at least A and z is at least C, their sum, x + z, will *always* be larger than y because y's maximum is C, which is less than A + C.  The same applies to y+z and x.  As y is at least B, and z at least C, y+z > x will *always* be satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only one I need to worry about is x + y > z.  This is the defining constraint!\n\nA brute-force method (iterating through all possible combinations of x, y, and z) is a definite non-starter.  The time complexity would be too high—O(n^3) in the worst case, where n is 5 * 10^5.  That's going to be too slow, and I need a more clever strategy. I have to find a way to optimize this to an efficient time complexity.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the triangle inequalities:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, `C <= z <= D`, and `A <= B <= C <= D`:\n\nFor `x + z > y`:\nThe smallest possible value of `x + z` is `A + C`.\nThe largest possible value of `y` is `C`.\nSince `A >= 1`, we have `A + C > C`, so `x + z > y` is always satisfied.\n\nFor `y + z > x`:\nThe smallest possible value of `y + z` is `B + C`.\nThe largest possible value of `x` is `B`.\nSince `C >= B >= A >= 1`, we have `B + C > B`, so `y + z > x` is always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to explicitly check is `x + y > z`.\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the number of integer triples `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nWe can iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`, and for each pair `(x, y)`, count the valid `z` values.\nFor a fixed `x` and `y`, `z` must satisfy:\n`C <= z <= D`\n`z < x + y` (from `x + y > z`)\n\nCombining these, `z` must satisfy `C <= z < x + y` and `z <= D`.\nSo, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a fixed `x, y` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nIterating `x` from `A` to `B` and `y` from `B` to `C` would be `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1))`. In the worst case, this is `O(D^2)`, which is `(5*10^5)^2 = 2.5 * 10^{11}`, too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach, likely by fixing one variable and summing up counts for the other two. Let's fix `z`.\n\nFor a fixed `z` in the range `[C, D]`, we need to find the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that:\n`A <= x <= B`\n`B <= y <= C`\n`x + y > z`\n\nThe condition `x + y > z` can be rewritten as `y > z - x`.\nSo for a fixed `x`, `y` must satisfy `max(B, z - x + 1) <= y <= C`.\nThe number of such `y` values is `max(0, C - max(B, z - x + 1) + 1)`.\n\nIterating `z` from `C` to `D` and `x` from `A` to `B` would still be `O((D-C+1) * (B-A+1))`, which is `O(D^2)` in the worst case. Still too slow.\n\nLet's try to sum over `x` and `y` more efficiently.\nWe are looking for `sum_{x=A}^{B} sum_{y=B}^{C} [x + y > z_min]`, where `z_min = C`.\nThe sum is over `x` from `A` to `B` and `y` from `B` to `C`.\nThe condition `x + y > z` depends on `z`.\nThe maximum possible value for `x + y` is `B + C`. The minimum is `A + B`.\nThe minimum possible value for `z` is `C`. The maximum is `D`.\n\nLet `S = x + y`. The condition is `S > z`.\nWe can iterate over `S` from `A + B` to `B + C`.\nFor each `S`, we need to:\n1. Count pairs `(x, y)` such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = S`.\n2. For each such `S`, count `z` values such that `C <= z <= D` and `z < S`.\n   The number of such `z` is `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`. Let this be `count_z(S)`.\n\nThe total answer is `sum_{S=A+B}^{B+C} (count_pairs(S) * count_z(S))`.\n\nLet's efficiently calculate `count_pairs(S)`.\n`x + y = S`\n`A <= x <= B`\n`B <= y <= C`\n\nFrom `y = S - x`:\n`B <= S - x <= C`\n`B <= S - x  => x <= S - B`\n`S - x <= C  => x >= S - C`\n\nSo `x` must satisfy `max(A, S - C) <= x <= min(B, S - B)`.\nThe number of such `x` (and thus `y`) is `max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1)`.\nLet `f(S) = count_pairs(S)`.\n\nThe maximum value of `S` is `B + C`. This is `5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5 = 10^6`.\nIterating `S` from `A+B` to `B+C` takes `O(B+C)` time.\nThis approach has a complexity of `O(D)` or `O(B+C)`, which is `O(5 * 10^5 + 5 * 10^5) = O(10^6)`, efficient enough.\n\nLet's refine the calculation of `f(S)`.\n`f(S)` is the number of `x` such that `A <= x <= B` and `B <= S - x <= C`.\nThis is equivalent to `max(A, S-C) <= x <= min(B, S-B)`.\nLet `L_x(S) = max(A, S-C)` and `R_x(S) = min(B, S-B)`.\n`f(S) = max(0, R_x(S) - L_x(S) + 1)`.\n\nThe total sum is `sum_{S=A+B}^{B+C} f(S) * max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nExample: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\nPossible `S = x+y`:\n`x` from 1 to 2. `y` from 2 to 3.\nMin `S = 1+2 = 3`. Max `S = 2+3 = 5`.\nSo `S` ranges from 3 to 5.\n\n`S = 3`:\n  `L_x(3) = max(A, 3-C) = max(1, 3-3) = max(1, 0) = 1`\n  `R_x(3) = min(B, 3-B) = min(2, 3-2) = min(2, 1) = 1`\n  `f(3) = max(0, 1 - 1 + 1) = 1`. (Pair is `(x,y)=(1,2)`)\n  `count_z(3) = max(0, min(D, 3-1) - C + 1) = max(0, min(4, 2) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 2 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 0) = 0`.\n  Contribution for `S=3`: `1 * 0 = 0`.\n\n`S = 4`:\n  `L_x(4) = max(A, 4-C) = max(1, 4-3) = max(1, 1) = 1`\n  `R_x(4) = min(B, 4-B) = min(2, 4-2) = min(2, 2) = 2`\n  `f(4) = max(0, 2 - 1 + 1) = 2`. (Pairs are `(1,3), (2,2)`)\n  `count_z(4) = max(0, min(D, 4-1) - C + 1) = max(0, min(4, 3) - 3 + 1) = max(0, 3 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 1) = 1`. (`z=3`)\n  Contribution for `S=4`: `2 * 1 = 2`.\n\n`S = 5`:\n  `L_x(5) = max(A, 5-C) = max(1, 5-3) = max(1, 2) = 2`\n  `R_x(5) = min(B, 5-B) = min(2, 5-2) = min(2, 3) = 2`\n  `f(5) = max(0, 2 - 2 + 1) = 1`.

(`z=3,4`)\n  Contribution for `S=5`: `1 * 2 = 2`.\n\nTotal count = `0 + 2 + 2 = 4`. This matches the example output.\n\nThe maximum value for `B+C` is `5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`.\nThe loop for `S` runs `O(B+C)` times.
