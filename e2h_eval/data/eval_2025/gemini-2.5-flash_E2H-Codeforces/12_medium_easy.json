The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem Solving for Xenia and Ringroad**\n\nOkay, I've got this Xenia and Ringroad problem in my sights.  Let's see, it's about a character, Xenia, moving around a circular arrangement of houses, and the goal is to calculate the total time it takes to complete a series of tasks. The setup is pretty clear: `n` houses in a ring (numbered 1 to `n`), `m` tasks, and each task `a_i` specifies the house Xenia needs to go to. Movement is clockwise, one house at a time takes one unit of time, and Xenia always starts at house 1.\n\nMy initial thought is to keep track of Xenia's current position and the elapsed time.  Initialize `current_house = 1` and `total_time = 0`. Now, I need to iterate through each task.  For each task `i`, I need to figure out the time to move from `current_house` to `target_house = a_i`.\n\nTwo cases come to mind: If `target_house` is greater than or equal to `current_house`, it's a direct clockwise move, and the time is just the difference. If `target_house` is less than `current_house`, Xenia needs to go all the way around the ring. This is where I need to be careful; the path is from `current_house` to `n`, then from 1 to `target_house`. So the time is the distance from `current_house` to `n` plus the distance from 1 to `target_house`.\n\nI've got the time calculation for each task sorted. I'll add that time to `total_time` and update `current_house` to `target_house` for the next task. The problem requires the *minimum* total time, which means I should always move clockwise since the problem statement allows only clockwise moves.\n\nI've even traced the given examples to confirm my logic. I've considered edge cases like when `target_house` equals `current_house` (time is 0), and also cases where the tasks loop back around the ring. I've also checked for other possible edge cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the constraints. `n` and `m` are up to 10^5, and the `a_i` are between 1 and `n`. The key thing here is the potential for large total times, up to `m * (n-1)`. I know Python's integers can handle this without any issues, which is great.\n\nFinally, regarding the implementation details, I'll read `n`, `m`, and the list of tasks from input. I'll need a loop to process the tasks one by one, using the logic I described. The time complexity looks like it'll be `O(m)`, since I'm just iterating through the tasks once. The space complexity is `O(m)` to store the tasks list, but that is fine given the input constraints. The output will be the `total_time`.\n\nI'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` for input, it's generally faster in these kinds of competitive programming situations. I'll test it out and hopefully, this will be a working solution for Xenia and her ring road! I've even checked to make sure that there are no unneeded comments or explanations, as the prompt specifies.\n",
