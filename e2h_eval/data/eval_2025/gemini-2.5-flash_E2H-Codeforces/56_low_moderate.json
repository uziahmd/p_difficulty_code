Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Guard Duty (easy)\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem's \"easy\" designation is encouraging, and the small constraints on `R` and `B` immediately scream that brute-force or backtracking solutions are likely viable.  We need to find a perfect matching between rebel spaceships and bases, but the critical condition is that none of the connecting paths intersect.  Since `R` must equal `B` for a perfect match, that's our first check.  If they don't match, we can just reject immediately.\n\nThe heart of the problem lies in efficiently determining if a perfect matching *exists*.  Intersection detection is the crux.  We know that two line segments intersect if their endpoints are on opposite sides of each other's lines.  The crucial geometric guarantee – \"no three points on a line\" – simplifies things; we don't have to worry about collinearity causing issues.\n\nThe small constraint of 10 for both numbers makes me think that the complexity can be high, even exponential. I think the answer is brute force and trying all permutations. Sorting seems like a good approach. How can sorting help? I could order the Rebel and Base points separately. I will sort them by an angle around the center point.\n\nThe angle sorting strategy seems to be the most promising. If we can sort both Rebels and Bases by their angles around a common point, and then try matchings, it may make intersection detection simpler. However, this is not optimal since the time complexity will still be exponential.\n\nLet's start by trying to generate all possible perfect matchings and check each for intersections.  This is a good starting point.  We can iterate through all possible base assignments for each rebel, recursively checking for intersections at each stage. This looks simple enough to code.\n",
