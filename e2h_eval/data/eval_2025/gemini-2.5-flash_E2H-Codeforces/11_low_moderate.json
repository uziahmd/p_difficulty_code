A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Soft Drinking Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Soft Drinking\" problem, and I need a Python script to solve it.  Let's break down the logic.  The core of this seems to be about figuring out the limiting resource for making toasts. I've got this input: a single line with eight integers representing the resources and the number of friends. I see: `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, `d`, `p`, `nl`, and `np`. They're all within the 1-1000 range.\n\nThe output wants a single integer: the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, where everyone makes the same number of toasts. Got it.\n\nNow, let's nail down the constraints. Each friend needs `nl` milliliters of drink, one lime slice, and `np` grams of salt per toast. I need to calculate the *maximum* number of toasts possible, factoring in the limitations.\n\nI need to calculate the total resources first.  Let me see...\n\n*   Drink: `k * l` milliliters total.\n*   Lime slices: `c * d` slices total.\n*   Salt:  `p` grams total.\n\nThe key is that each friend needs these resources. So, if they are making X number of toasts, each friend gets X number of those resources.\n\nI'm thinking that I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts that are possible for the *whole group* based on each resource, and then distribute it evenly to everyone. But the prompt actually asks how many each *individual* friend can make. I'm going to determine how many toasts one friend can make with the given resources, and then take the lowest one among all resources.\n\nHere's my logic:\n\n1.  Calculate the number of toasts possible from drink per friend: `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n2.  Calculate the number of toasts possible from lime slices per friend: `(c * d) // n`.\n3.  Calculate the number of toasts possible from salt per friend: `p // (n * np)`.\n\nI'll take the minimum of these three values as the answer since that is the limiting factor! This minimum represents how many toasts *each friend* can make. That approach seems sound to me. Now, to code it.\n",
