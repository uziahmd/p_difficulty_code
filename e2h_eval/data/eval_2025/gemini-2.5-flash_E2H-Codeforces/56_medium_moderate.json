Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analysis and Strategy for the Guard Duty Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem and need to come up with a Python script.  The core of it is matching Rebel spaceships to bases, but crucially, their paths can't intersect.  It's immediately clear that if the number of rebels and bases aren't equal, we're done - \"No\".  We're given that the coordinates are small-ish integers (up to 10000), and both the number of rebels and bases are limited to a maximum of 10.  This little-number-of-items hints at an exponential solution might actually be feasible.\n\nSince we're talking about non-intersecting paths, the geometry here is going to be important.  The problem cleverly guarantees no three points are collinear, and no two points coincide. This simplifies things - no weird edge cases to worry about regarding segments that touch or overlap.  Segment intersection, now, needs this crucial check: two line segments intersect if and only if their endpoints are on opposite sides of each other's lines.\n\nWe'll define some geometric primitives: points as (x,y) and then vectors, and the 2D cross product.  The cross product will be our friend for orientation tests. A cross product `A x B > 0` means vector B is counter-clockwise from A; this is key to determining if segments intersect. It's the standard test.\n\nMy strategy?  Iterate through all possible permutations of base assignments to rebels. Each rebel gets assigned to exactly one base (a perfect matching).  Since there are only 10 bases, there are only 10! permutations (that's about 3.6 million, which is within the realm of possibility for reasonable execution time). For each permutation, construct segments (a rebel to their base) and then *check every pair* of segments for intersection. If I find a permutation that yields a set of non-intersecting segments, I'm done - print \"Yes\". If I exhaust all permutations and *none* work, print \"No\".\n\nTo keep the code clean, I'll define a Point class (or use named tuples) and implement `orientation` function, and using that, I'll build the `segments_intersect` function. The `segments_intersect` function is the workhorse of checking, using the orientation to determine the intersections.  Then, in the main algorithm, read the inputs (rebels and bases), check the R=B condition, and iterate through the permutations. Inside the permutation loop, construct segments, check for intersection within, and print the result. The time complexity will be R! * R^2 (R factorial, times the number of segment pairs to check for intersections). The program structure is pretty straightforward. I'm going to follow this plan and write it down step by step and test with an example input.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to assign `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that:\n1.  Every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (a perfect matching). This implies `R` must be equal to `B`.\n2.  Any two straight paths (segments) connecting a spaceship to its assigned base do not intersect.\n\nWe are given `R, B <= 10`, and coordinates up to 10000. It's guaranteed that no two points coincide and no three points are collinear.\n\n**1. Initial Check:**\nIf `R != B`, a perfect matching is impossible, so we immediately output \"No\".\n\n**2. Geometric Primitives:**\nThe core of the problem is checking for segment intersections. This can be done efficiently using the 2D cross product, which determines the orientation of three points.\n\n*   **Point Representation:** We'll use a simple `Point` class with `x` and `y` attributes.\n*   **Orientation Test:** Given three points `p`, `q`, `r`, the function `orientation(p, q, r)` calculates the 2D cross product of vectors `(q-p)` and `(r-p)`.\n    *   `val = (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)`\n    *   If `val > 0`, `r` is counter-clockwise (left turn) with respect to the directed line segment `pq`.\n    *   If `val < 0`, `r` is clockwise (right turn).\n    *   If `val = 0`, `p`, `q`, `r` are collinear.\n    Since the problem guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\", `val` will never be 0. We can return `1` for CCW and `-1` for CW.\n\n*   **Segment Intersection Check:** Two line segments `(p1, q1)` and `(p2, q2)` intersect if and only if:\n    1.  `p2` and `q2` lie on opposite sides of the line defined by `p1q1`. This means `orientation(p1, q1, p2)` and `orientation(p1, q1, q2)` must have different signs.\n    2.  `p1` and `q1` lie on opposite sides of the line defined by `p2q2`. This means `orientation(p2, q2, p1)` and `orientation(p2, q2, q1)` must have different signs.\n    Given our `orientation` function returns `1` or `-1`, checking for different signs simply means `o1 != o2` and `o3 != o4`.\n\n**3. Algorithm for Finding a Non-Intersecting Matching:**\n\nSince `R` and `B` are very small (up to 10), we can try all possible assignments (permutations) and check if any of them satisfy the non-intersection constraint.\n\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  Read `R` spaceship coordinates into a list `rebels`.\n3.  Read `B` base coordinates into a list `bases`.\n4.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n5.  Generate all permutations of indices `0` to `B-1`. Each permutation `p` represents an assignment where `rebels[i]` is connected to `bases[p[i]]`.\n6.  For each permutation `p`:\n    a.  Construct the list of `R` segments: `[(rebels[i], bases[p[i]]) for i in range(R)]`.\n    b.  Check for intersections: Iterate through all unique pairs of these `R` segments. For each pair `(seg_k, seg_l)`, call `segments_intersect` to see if they cross.\n    c.  If any pair of segments intersects, this permutation is invalid. Stop checking this permutation and move to the next one.\n    d.  If all pairs of segments are checked and no intersections are found, then this permutation represents a valid non-intersecting matching. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n7.  If all permutations are checked and none are found to be valid, print \"No\".\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   Number of permutations: `R!` (e.g., `10! = 3,628,800`).\n*   For each permutation, we generate `R` segments.\n*   Checking for intersections involves iterating through `R * (R - 1) / 2` pairs of segments (e.g., `10 * 9 / 2 = 45` pairs for `R=10`).\n*   Each `segments_intersect` call involves 4 calls to `orientation`. Each `orientation` call is a few arithmetic operations.\n*   Total operations: `R! * O(R^2)`. For `R=10`, this is approximately `3.6 * 10^6 * 45 * 4 = 6.48 * 10^8` simple operations. While this is high for Python, the constant factor for arithmetic operations is very small, and for `N=10` it is often accepted. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle large coordinate values (cross products up to `20000 * 20000 = 4 * 10^8`) without overflow.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\n# Point class to store coordinates\nclass Point:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    # For debugging purposes, not strictly necessary for the solution\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n\n# Helper function to determine the orientation of ordered triplet (p, q, r).\n# This function calculates the 2D cross product of vectors (q-p) and (r-p).\n# A positive value indicates a counter-clockwise turn.\n# A negative value indicates a clockwise turn.\n# A zero value indicates that p, q, and r are collinear.\n#\n# Given the problem statement guarantee \"no three points are on the same line\",\n# this function will always return 1 (for counter-clockwise) or -1 (for clockwise).\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - \\\n          (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)\n    \n    # According to problem constraints, val will never be 0.\n    # Return 1 for CCW, -1 for CW.\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\n# Helper function to check if two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect.\n# This implementation relies on the fact that no three points are collinear.\n# If three points could be collinear, additional checks for segment overlap\n# or endpoint touching would be necessary.\ndef segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2):\n    # Find the four orientations needed for the general case of segment intersection\n    o1 = orientation(p1, q1, p2) # Orientation of (p1, q1, p2)\n    o2 = orientation(p1, q1, q2) # Orientation of (p1, q1, q2)\n    o3 = orientation(p2, q2, p1) # Orientation of (p2, q2, p1)\n    o4 = orientation(p2, q2, q1) # Orientation of (p2, q2, q1)\n\n    # General case for intersection:\n    # Segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect if and only if\n    # (o1 and o2 have different signs) AND (o3 and o4 have different signs).\n    # Since 'orientation' returns 1 or -1 (never 0 due to problem constraints),\n    # checking for different signs simply means checking if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4.\n    return o1 != o2 and o3 != o4\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        rebels.append(Point(x, y))\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        bases.append(Point(x, y))\n\n    # A perfect matching requires the number of rebels and bases to be equal.\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    # Iterate through all possible permutations of base assignments to rebels.\n    # Each permutation 'p' defines an assignment: rebel 'i' connects to base 'p[i]'.\n    # The indices of bases are 0 to B-1.\n    for p in itertools.permutations(range(B)):\n        current_segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            # Create a segment from rebel 'i' to the base assigned by the permutation 'p[i]'\n            current_segments.append((rebels[i], bases[p[i]]))\n        \n        # Check if any two segments in the current assignment intersect.\n        intersects = False\n        # We need to check every unique pair of segments.\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R): # Start from i+1 to avoid checking (seg, seg) and (seg_j, seg_i)\n                seg1_p1, seg1_p2 = current_segments[i]\n                seg2_p1, seg2_p2 = current_segments[j]\n                \n                if segments_intersect(seg1_p1, seg1_p2, seg2_p1, seg2_p2):\n                    intersects = True\n                    break # Found an intersection, this permutation is invalid\n            if intersects:\n                break # Break from outer loop as well\n        \n        # If no intersections were found after checking all pairs, this is a valid assignment.\n        # Print \"Yes\" and terminate, as we only need to find one such assignment.\n        if not intersects:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n            \n    # If the loop finishes, it means no valid permutation was found.\n    print(\"No\")\n\n# Call the main solve function\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
