He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Base Conversion Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this base conversion problem. The user wants a Python script, and I'm on board. Essentially, I need to take a number `c` in base `a` and convert it to base `b`. The inputs are straightforward: `a` and `b` on the first line, then `c` on the second. `a` is definitely an integer between 2 and 25, and `b` can be an integer in that range or the letter 'R' for Roman numerals. The decimal representation of `c` has certain limits depending on what `b` is.\n\nThe constraints are key here. If `b` is 'R', the decimal equivalent of `c` is capped at 3000, and it's guaranteed to be non-zero. Otherwise, the decimal value of `c` is no more than 10^15. Crucially, the input `c` can have leading zeros and won't exceed a length of 1000.\n\nI've got a two-step process in mind. First, I'll convert the input `c` from base `a` into its decimal (base 10) equivalent. Then, I'll convert that decimal value to the desired base `b`. If `b` is 'R', I'll translate the decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nFor that initial conversion, I'm thinking I'll need a function, let's call it `to_decimal(num_str, base)`. It'll take the number as a string and the base. I'll iterate through the string from right to left, dealing with each digit. Regular digits are straightforward (0-9). The letters are where I need to pay attention, 'A' maps to 10, 'B' to 11, etc., up to 'P' being 25. Each digit's value gets multiplied by the base raised to the power of its position, and I sum those results.\n\nThe constraint on the decimal value's size is essential to note. If `b` isn't 'R', the decimal value of `c` won't exceed 10^15. I'll need to remember that when thinking about string lengths. It should significantly limit the size of `c`, especially for larger bases.\n\nFor instance, `c` equal to \"A\" in base 12 is just 10. For a bigger example, \"1111001\" in base 2 is 121. I need to make sure my logic handles all those conversions properly.\n",
