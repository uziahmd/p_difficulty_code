The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my understanding of the problem and the solution approach:**\n\nThe goal is to calculate the probability, modulo a large prime, that a valid signal power assignment exists for a given number of towns (`n`).  A valid assignment means that each town (except the first and last) is covered by exactly one radio tower, and that the signal power of each tower is consistent with its position.\n\nMy thinking is that I need to analyze how the constraints affect which towers are built and how their signal powers must be chosen. The key is to see that the problem boils down to partitioning the towns into odd-length intervals, where the center of each interval must have a tower built. The signal power for the tower at the center is then uniquely determined by the interval's length.\n\nI define a dynamic programming approach to find `dp[k]`, which represents the number of ways to partition the first `k` towns into odd-length intervals.  I realize that this is equivalent to the (shifted) Fibonacci sequence, specifically  `dp[k] = F_{k+1}` (where F_n is the n-th Fibonacci number starting with F_0=0, F_1=1).\n\nTo get the final probability, I divide the total number of valid partitions ( `dp[n]` ) by the total number of possible tower configurations ( `2^n` ). I then take this result modulo the given large prime.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that a valid signal power assignment exists, given a random configuration of radio towers. There are $n+2$ towns from $0$ to $n+1$. Towers are built in towns $1, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$ each, independently.\n\nA tower in town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$. This means it covers towns in the interval $(i-p, i+p)$, specifically integers $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$.\n\nThe constraints for setting signal powers are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from *exactly one* radio tower each.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we choose a power $p_i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nConstraint 1 implies:\n- For town $0$: $i - p_i + 1 > 0 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n- For town $n+1$: $i + p_i - 1 < n + 1 \\implies p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nSo, for each $i \\in S$, we must choose $p_i$ such that $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\nConstraint 2 implies that the towns $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ must be partitioned into disjoint intervals, where each interval is covered by exactly one tower.\nLet an interval $[L, R]$ be covered by a tower at $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$.\nThen $L = i - p_i + 1$ and $R = i + p_i - 1$.\nFrom these equations, we can deduce $i$ and $p_i$:\n- The length of the interval is $R - L + 1 = (i+p_i-1) - (i-p_i+1) + 1 = 2p_i - 1$.\n  This means the length must be an odd integer.\n- The center of the interval is $i = (L+R)/2$.\n  This means $L+R$ must be an even integer, which is consistent with $L$ and $R$ having the same parity if $R-L+1$ is odd.\n- The power is $p_i = (R-L+1+1)/2 = (R-L+2)/2$.\n\nWe must check if the derived $p_i$ satisfies $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$:\n- $p_i \\ge 1$: $(R-L+2)/2 \\ge 1 \\implies R-L+2 \\ge 2 \\implies R-L \\ge 0$. This is true since $R \\ge L$.\n- $p_i \\le i$: $(R-L+2)/2 \\le (L+R)/2 \\implies R-L+2 \\le L+R \\implies 2 \\le 2L \\implies L \\ge 1$. This is true since we are partitioning towns $1, \\dots, n$.\n- $p_i \\le n+1-i$: $(R-L+2)/2 \\le n+1 - (L+R)/2 \\implies R-L+2 \\le 2(n+1) - (L+R) \\implies R-L+2 \\le 2n+2-L-R \\implies 2R+2 \\le 2n+2 \\implies R \\le n$. This is true since we are partitioning towns $1, \\dots, n$.\n\nSo, for a given set $S$ of built towers, a valid assignment of powers exists if and only if:\n1. The towns $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ can be partitioned into disjoint intervals $[L_j, R_j]$.\n2. Each interval $[L_j, R_j]$ must have an odd length.\n3. For each interval $[L_j, R_j]$, its center $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ must be a town where a tower is built (i.e., $i_j \\in S$).\n4. Furthermore, *every* tower built in $S$ must be used to cover some interval. If a tower $i \\in S$ is not used as a center for any $[L_j, R_j]$, it must not cover any town $c \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. This would require $p_i=0$, but $p_i \\ge 1$. Thus, the set of centers must be exactly $S$.\n\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of ways to partition the towns $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ into odd-length intervals. Each such partition uniquely determines the set $S$ of required tower locations (the centers of the intervals).\nThe probability is $\\frac{\\text{number of valid } S \\text{ sets}}{2^n}$.\nThe number of valid $S$ sets is precisely $dp[n]$.\n\nWe can compute $dp[k]$ using dynamic programming:\n- $dp[0] = 1$ (There is one way to partition an empty set of towns: the empty partition).\n- For $k \\ge 1$: Town $k$ must be the rightmost point of some interval $[L, k]$.\n  This interval $[L, k]$ must have an odd length, so $L$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n  The remaining towns $\\{1, \\dots, L-1\\}$ must be partitioned, which can be done in $dp[L-1]$ ways.\n  So, $dp[k] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv k \\pmod 2}^{k} dp[L-1]$.\n\nLet's compute the first few values:\n- $dp[0] = 1$\n- $dp[1]$: $L=1$ (same parity as $k=1$). $dp[1] = dp[0] = 1$. (Partition: $\\{[1,1]\\}$, $S=\\{1\\}$)\n- $dp[2]$: $L=2$ (same parity as $k=2$). $dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$. (Partition: $\\{[1,1], [2,2]\\}$, $S=\\{1,2\\}$)\n- $dp[3]$: $L=3$ (same parity as $k=3$), $L=1$ (same parity as $k=3$). $dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n  (Partitions: $\\{[1,1], [2,2], [3,3]\\}$, $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$; and $\\{[1,3]\\}$, $S=\\{2\\}$)\n- $dp[4]$: $L=4, 2$ (same parity as $k=4$). $dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[1] = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n- $dp[5]$: $L=5, 3, 1$ (same parity as $k=5$). $dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[2] + dp[0] = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5$.\n\nThe sequence $dp[k]$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \\dots$ is $1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$.\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence, specifically $dp[k] = F_{k+1}$ if we define $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\n(Note: $F_1=1$, $F_2=1$, $F_3=2$, $F_4=3$, $F_5=5$, $F_6=8$.)\nSo, $dp[0]=F_1=1$, $dp[1]=F_2=1$, $dp[2]=F_3=2$ (this is where my manual calculation was off, $dp[2]=1$ was for $S=\\{1,2\\}$ and not $S=\\{2\\}$).\n\nLet's re-evaluate $dp[k]$ carefully.\n$dp[k] = \\sum_{j=0, k-j \\text{ odd}}^{k-1} dp[j]$.\n$dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-3] + \\dots$\nThis is not $F_{k+1}$.\nLet's use the recurrence:\n$dp[k] = dp[k-2] + dp[k-4] + \\dots + dp[\\text{last_term}]$\n$dp[k-1] = dp[k-3] + dp[k-5] + \\dots + dp[\\text{last_term}]$\nIf $k$ and $k-1$ have `last_term` of same parity (i.e. if $k$ is even, $dp[1]$ is last for $dp[k]$, $dp[0]$ is last for $dp[k-1]$), then $dp[k] = dp[k-2] + dp[k-1]$?\nNo.\n$dp[k] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv k \\pmod 2}^{k} dp[L-1]$\n$dp[k] = dp[k-1]$ if $k$ is even. (Only $L=k$ is possible, $dp[k-1]$).\n$dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-3] + \\dots + dp[0]$ if $k$ is odd.\nFrom this, we see that $dp[k]$ for odd $k$ is $dp[k-2] + dp[k-1]$.\n$dp[k] = dp[k-2] + dp[k-1]$ for $k \\ge 3$.\nLet's check this recurrence:\n$dp[0]=1$\n$dp[1]=1$\n$dp[2]=dp[1]=1$ (using $dp[k]=dp[k-1]$ for even $k$)\n$dp[3]=dp[1]+dp[2]=1+1=2$ (using $dp[k]=dp[k-2]+dp[k-1]$ for odd $k \\ge 3$)\n$dp[4]=dp[3]=2$ (using $dp[k]=dp[k-1]$ for even $k$)\n$dp[5]=dp[3]+dp[4]=2+2=4$ (using $dp[k]=dp[k-2]+dp[k-1]$ for odd $k \\ge 3$)\n$dp[6]=dp[5]=4$\n$dp[7]=dp[5]+dp[6]=4+4=8$\n\nThe sequence is $1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, \\dots$.\nFor odd $k$, $dp[k] = 2^{(k-1)/2}$.\nFor even $k$, $dp[k] = 2^{(k-2)/2}$.\nOr, more compactly, $dp[k] = 2^{\\lfloor (k-1)/2 \\rfloor}$ for $k \\ge 1$. $dp[0]=1$.\nThe total probability is $dp[n] / 2^n$.\n\nLet's recheck examples with this sequence:\n- $n=2$: $dp[2] = 2^{\\lfloor (2-1)/2 \\rfloor} = 2^0 = 1$. Probability $1/2^2 = 1/4$.\n  Example output for $n=2$ is `748683265`, which is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$. This matches.\n- $n=3$: $dp[3] = 2^{\\lfloor (3-1)/2 \\rfloor} = 2^1 = 2$. Probability $2/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$.\n  Example output for $n=3$ is `748683265`, which is $1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$. This matches.\n- $n=5$: $dp[5] = 2^{\\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor} = 2^2 = 4$. Probability $4/2^5 = 4/32 = 1/8$.\n  Example output for $n=5$ is `842268673`. Let's check `1/8`.\n  $8^{-1} \\pmod{998244353} = 124780544.125$.\n  $998244353 + 1 = 998244354$. $998244354 / 8 = 124780544.25$.\n  $998244353 \\times k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. $1 \\times k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. So $k=1$.\n  $8^{-1} \\pmod{998244353} = \\text{pow}(8, 998244353-2, 998244353) = 124780544$.\n  So $1/8 \\pmod{998244353}$ is $124780544$.\n  The example output `842268673` does not match $1/8$.\n  The example output for $n=5$ is $5/32$.\n  $5 \\times \\text{pow}(32, 998244353-2, 998244353) = 5 \\times 311951361 = 1559756805 \\pmod{998244353} = 561512452$. Still not matching.\n\nMy derived $dp[k]$ sequence is incorrect. Let's trace the Fibonacci relationship again.\nThe standard Fibonacci sequence $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\nThe recurrence $dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]$ for $k \\ge 2$ with $dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1$ gives:\n$1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \\dots$. This is $F_{k+1}$ for $k \\ge 0$.\nSo $dp[k] = F_{k+1}$.\nLet's check this against the examples again.\n- $n=2$: $dp[2] = F_3 = 2$. Probability $2/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$.\n  Example output is $1/4$. This does not match.\n- $n=3$: $dp[3] = F_4 = 3$. Probability $3/2^3 = 3/8$.\n  Example output is $1/4$. This does not match.\n- $n=5$: $dp[5] = F_6 = 8$. Probability $8/2^5 = 8/32 = 1/4$.\n  Example output is $5/32$. This does not match.\n\nThe example outputs are:\n$n=2: 1/4$\n$n=3: 1/4$\n$n=5: 5/32$\n\nLet's reconsider the definition of $dp[k]$ from the problem note:\n\"if $n=5$, and you have built the towers in towns $2, 4, 5$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $2$ to $2$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $4$ and $5$ to $1$. That way, towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $1, 2, 3$ get the signal from the tower in town $2$, town $4$ gets the signal from the tower in town $4$, and town $5$ gets the signal from the tower in town $5$.\"\nThis implies the following partition:\n- Tower at $2$ with power $2$: covers $[2-2+1, 2+2-1] = [1,3]$.\n- Tower at $4$ with power $1$: covers $[4-1+1, 4+1-1] = [4,4]$.\n- Tower at $5$ with power $1$: covers $[5-1+1, 5+1-1] = [5,5]$.\nThe set of towns where towers are built is $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$.\nThe partition of $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ is $\\{[1,3], [4,4], [5,5]\\}$.\nThe centers are $i_1=(1+3)/2=2$, $i_2=(4+4)/2=4$, $i_3=(5+5)/2=5$.\nThe set of centers is $\\{2,4,5\\}$, which is exactly $S$.\nThe lengths are $3, 1, 1$ (all odd).\nThis specific configuration is valid. Its probability is $(1/2)^3 \\times (1/2)^2 = 1/32$.\n\nThe problem is asking for the sum of probabilities of all valid $S$ configurations.\nLet $f[k]$ be the number of ways to partition $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ into odd-length intervals.\n$f[0]=1$.\n$f[k] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv k \\pmod 2}^{k} f[L-1]$.\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence $F_{k+1}$ (with $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\n$f[0]=1, f[1]=1, f[2]=1, f[3]=2, f[4]=3, f[5]=5$.\nThis sequence counts the number of partitions. For $n=5$, there are $f[5]=5$ such partitions.\nEach partition $P_j$ corresponds to a unique set $S_j$ of towers.\nThe probability for a given $S_j$ is $(1/2)^{|S_j|} \\times (1/2)^{n-|S_j|} = (1/2)^n$.\nSo the total probability is $f[n] \\times (1/2)^n$.\n\nLet's use this to check the examples:\n- $n=2$: $f[2]=1$. Probability $1/2^2 = 1/4$. Matches example.\n- $n=3$: $f[3]=2$. Probability $2/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. Matches example.\n- $n=5$: $f[5]=5$. Probability $5/2^5 = 5/32$. Matches example.\n\nSo, the solution is indeed $F_{n+1} \\pmod{998244353}$ multiplied by $2^{-n} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nWe need to calculate $F_{n+1}$. Since $n$ can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$, we need an efficient way to compute Fibonacci numbers. Matrix exponentiation works in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n\nMatrix for Fibonacci numbers:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} F_k \\\\ F_{k-1} \\end{pmatrix}$\nSo, $\\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} \\\\ F_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe need $F_{n+1}$, which is the top-left element of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n+1}$ (if we want $F_{n+1}$ directly from $(F_1, F_0)$).\nLet $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. We want to compute $M^n$.\n$M^n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_n \\\\ F_n & F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo the value we need is $F_{n+1}$, which is `(M^n)[0][0]`.\n\nThe modulus is $998244353$.\nThe steps are:\n1. Define matrix multiplication function modulo $998244353$.\n2. Define matrix exponentiation function (binary exponentiation) modulo $998244353$.\n3. Compute $M^n = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n$.\n4. Extract $F_{n+1}$ from $M^n$. This will be $M^n[0][0]$.\n5. Compute $2^{-n} \\pmod{998244353}$ using modular inverse: $\\text{pow}(2, -n, \\text{MOD}) = \\text{pow}(2, \\text{MOD}-1-n, \\text{MOD})$.\n6. Multiply $F_{n+1}$ by $2^{-n}$ and take modulo.\n\nEdge cases:\n- $n=1$: $dp[1]=F_2=1$. Probability $1/2^1 = 1/2$.\n  Using matrix exponentiation: $M^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. $F_{1+1}=F_2=1$.\n  Result $1 \\times \\text{pow}(2, \\text{MOD}-1-1, \\text{MOD}) = 1 \\times \\text{pow}(2, 998244351, 998244353) = 499122177$.\n  $1/2 \\pmod{998244353} = (998244353+1)/2 = 499122177$. This is correct.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1. Set `MOD = 998244353`.\n2. Define a function `multiply(A, B)` for $2 \\times 2$ matrices modulo `MOD`.\n3. Define a function `matrix_pow(A, k)` for matrix exponentiation modulo `MOD`.\n4. If $n=0$, the probability is 0 (no towns $1..n$). But $n \\ge 1$.\n5. Compute `fib_matrix = matrix_pow([[1, 1], [1, 0]], n)`.\n6. The value $F_{n+1}$ is `fib_matrix[0][0]`.\n7. Compute `inv_2_pow_n = pow(2, MOD - 1 - n, MOD)`.\n8.
