    "thought": "**Tackling a Challenging Combinatorial Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm facing a competitive programming problem that boils down to counting the ways to assign values to binary strings. Specifically, I need to find the number of possible $c_s$ values for all binary strings 's' of lengths 1 to 'n', where each $c_s$ is an integer from 0 to 'k'. The crucial condition is that the maximum size of a \"beautiful\" multiset must equal 'f'. A \"beautiful\" multiset is one where, for any binary string 's' of length 1 to 'n', the number of strings in the multiset that have 's' as a prefix doesn't exceed $c_s$.\n\nMy initial instinct is to dig into the heart of what defines the maximum size of this beautiful multiset. It feels like a maximum flow problem, or perhaps a minimum-cost maximum flow if we introduce the idea of assigning costs. However, I think that the best idea is to maximize the number of strings. If I consider a string $S$ of length $n$ that is in the multiset, the count of strings that have any prefix of $S$ as a prefix is increased by one.\n\nLet's represent this with a multiset $M$ containing strings of length $n$. For a string $s$ of length $L < n$, $s$ has two children $s0$ and $s1$. The number of strings in $M$ that have $s$ as a prefix is the sum of the strings that have $s0$ and $s1$ as prefixes, respectively. I can denote this count as $N(s)$. So, for all strings $s$ of length 1 to $n$, I have $N(s) \\le c_s$, and the fundamental recursive relation holds: $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$ if $L<n$. For $s$ of length $n$, $N(s)$ is simply the number of times that $s$ appears in $M$. The total size of the multiset is $\\sum_{s \\text{ len } n} N(s)$, which is the sum of leaf node values. Moreover, this sum is $N(\\epsilon)$ but I notice that the problem does not constrain the value of $c_{\\epsilon}$.\n\nThis structure immediately screams \"binary tree\" to me. The root is the empty string, and each level corresponds to strings of a specific length. The leaves are strings of length $n$. Each internal node has two children, representing the addition of a '0' or '1' to its string prefix. The key constraints are the $N(s) \\le c_s$ and $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$ where $s$ has length less than $n$.\n\nMy goal is to maximize $\\sum_{s \\text{ len } n} N(s)$, the total size of the multiset, subject to these constraints. This strongly suggests either a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming on the tree. To get the biggest multiset, I should strive to make the values of $N(s)$ as large as possible without violating the $c_s$ limits or the binary tree structure. For each leaf node (strings of length $n$), I'm limited by $c_s$. For internal nodes (strings of length less than $n$), I'm also limited by $c_s$, and by the sum of my children. Now, I need to figure out how to efficiently count the *number of ways* to achieve the desired multiset size of 'f' under these conditions.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s \\in [0, k]$ for every binary string $s$ of length $1$ to $n$, such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset is exactly $f$. We need to output this count modulo $998244353$.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined.\nLet $N(s)$ be the number of strings in the multiset that have $s$ as a prefix.\nThe conditions for a beautiful multiset are:\n1. $N(s) \\le c_s$ for all $s$ of length $1, \\dots, n$.\n2. For any string $s$ of length $L < n$, $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$.\n3. For any string $s$, $N(s) \\ge 0$.\nThe total size of the multiset is $\\sum_{s \\text{ len } n} N(s)$. This sum is also equal to $N(\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string (the root of the binary string tree).\n\nTo maximize the total size, we can use a dynamic programming approach on the string tree, starting from the leaves (strings of length $n$) and going up to the root.\nFor a string $s$ of length $n$, $N(s)$ can be at most $c_s$.\nFor a string $s$ of length $L < n$, $N(s)$ must satisfy $N(s) \\le c_s$ and $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$. To maximize $N(s)$, we should maximize $N(s0)$ and $N(s1)$.\nThe maximum possible value for $N(s)$ is $\\min(c_s, \\text{max_N}(s0) + \\text{max_N}(s1))$.\nBase cases: For strings $s$ of length $n$, $\\text{max_N}(s) = c_s$.\nUsing this recursive definition, the maximum total size of a beautiful multiset is $\\text{max_N}(\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string.\nHowever, $c_s$ is only defined for $s$ of length $1$ to $n$. So, $\\text{max_N}(\\epsilon)$ is not directly constrained by $c_{\\epsilon}$. Instead, $\\text{max_N}(\\epsilon) = \\text{max_N}(0) + \\text{max_N}(1)$.\n\nLet $S_L$ be the set of all binary strings of length $L$.\nThe strings $s$ of length $L$ are $2^L$ in number.\nThe total number of strings $s$ for which we choose $c_s$ is $\\sum_{L=1}^n 2^L = 2(2^n-1)$.\n$n$ is small ($n \\le 15$), so $2^n$ can be up to $32768$. $k$ and $f$ can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nNotice that the structure of the problem is symmetric: all strings of the same length behave identically.\nLet $S_L$ be the maximum possible prefix count for any string of length $L$, given the optimal choices for its children.\nThen $S_n = c_s$ for any $s$ of length $n$.\nFor $L < n$, $S_L = \\min(c_s, S_{L+1} + S_{L+1})$.\nThis means that for any string $s$ of length $L$, the maximum prefix count $N(s)$ will be $\\min(c_s, 2 \\cdot \\text{max_N_of_child})$.\nLet $x_L$ be the value $\\text{max_N}(s)$ for any string $s$ of length $L$.\nThen $x_n = c_s$.\nFor $L < n$, $x_L = \\min(c_s, 2x_{L+1})$.\nThe total size of the multiset is $x_0 = 2x_1$. (Here $x_0$ is $\\text{max_N}(\\epsilon)$.)\n\nThis implies that if we choose $c_s$ values such that for all $s$ of length $L$, $c_s$ is the same value, say $C_L$, then the maximum multiset size will be determined by these $C_L$ values.\nSpecifically, let $x_L$ be the maximum count for any string of length $L$.\n$x_n = C_n$.\n$x_{L} = \\min(C_L, 2x_{L+1})$ for $L=n-1, \\dots, 1$.\nThe final result is $2x_1$.\n\nThe problem is that $c_s$ can be chosen independently for each string $s$. However, the structure of the problem is such that to maximize $N(s)$, we want to maximize $N(s0)$ and $N(s1)$. If $s0$ and $s1$ are \"symmetric\" (i.e., we choose their $c$ values in a way that gives them the same maximum prefix count), then it simplifies.\nConsider the maximum value $X_L$ that any string $s$ of length $L$ can contribute as a prefix count.\n$X_n = c_s$.\n$X_L = \\min(c_s, X_{L0} + X_{L1})$ where $X_{L0}$ and $X_{L1}$ are the maximum counts for children $s0$ and $s1$.\nThe total count is $X_0 = X_0 + X_1$.\nThe key insight here is that the problem is asking for the number of ways to choose *all* $c_s$ values. The $c_s$ values are independent.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is $X = \\text{max_N}(0) + \\text{max_N}(1)$.\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a fixed string $s_0$ of length $L-1$, such that $\\text{max_N}(s_0)$ becomes $val$.\nThis is too complex. The $c_s$ for different $s$ are chosen independently.\n\nLet's simplify the structure.\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is found by computing $N(s)$ for all $s$ from length $n$ up to length $1$.\nFor $s$ of length $n$, $N(s) = c_s$.\nFor $s$ of length $L < n$, $N(s) = \\min(c_s, N(s0) + N(s1))$.\nThe total size is $\\sum_{s \\text{ len } n} N(s)$. This is equivalent to $N(\\epsilon)$ if we define $c_{\\epsilon}$ to be $\\infty$.\nThe actual total size is $N(0) + N(1)$.\nLet $dp[L][x]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a fixed string $s_0$ of length $L-1$, such that the maximum possible count for $s_0$ is $x$.\nFor $L=n$: For a string $s$ of length $n-1$, its children are $s0$ and $s1$. The max count for $s0$ is $c_{s0}$, and for $s1$ is $c_{s1}$.\nSo $N(s) = \\min(c_s, c_{s0} + c_{s1})$.\nThe $c_s$ values for strings of length $L$ are chosen from $[0, k]$.\nLet $P_L(x)$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all descendants of a string $s_0$ of length $L-1$ (i.e., all strings $s'$ where $s_0$ is a prefix of $s'$) such that $N(s_0)=x$.\nThis is still not quite right because $c_s$ for $s$ of length $L$ affects $N(s)$ directly.\n\nLet $dp[L][x]$ be the number of ways to choose values $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L, L+1, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a *single* string $p$ of length $L-1$, such that the maximum prefix count for $p$ is $x$.\nThe number of strings of length $L$ is $2^L$.\nThe values of $c_s$ are from $0$ to $k$.\nLet $S_L$ be the set of $2^L$ strings of length $L$.\nFor each $s \\in S_L$, we choose $c_s \\in [0, k]$.\nThe maximum possible total sum is $f$.\nLet $F_L(x)$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ values for strings $s$ of length $L, L+1, \\dots, n$ *which are descendants of a generic string of length $L-1$*, such that the maximum possible value for that string of length $L-1$ is $x$.\nBase case: $L=n$. We are considering strings of length $n-1$. A string $p$ of length $n-1$ has two children $p0$ and $p1$.\nFor $p0$, we choose $c_{p0} \\in [0, k]$. For $p1$, we choose $c_{p1} \\in [0, k]$.\nThe maximum count for $p0$ is $c_{p0}$, for $p1$ is $c_{p1}$.\nFor $p$, we choose $c_p \\in [0, k]$. The maximum count for $p$ is $\\min(c_p, c_{p0} + c_{p1})$.\nLet $dp[L][x]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a string of length $L-1$, such that the resulting max prefix count for that length $L-1$ string is $x$.\nFor $L=n$: The strings are $s_n$ (length $n$). $c_{s_n}$ is chosen.\nThe values $c_s$ for strings of length $n$ are chosen. There are $2^n$ such strings.\nThe values $c_s$ for strings of length $n-1$ are chosen. There are $2^{n-1}$ such strings.\n...\nThe values $c_s$ for strings of length $1$ are chosen. There are $2^1$ such strings.\n\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $i, i+1, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a *fixed* string $p$ of length $i-1$, such that the maximum count for $p$ is $j$.\nFor $i=n$: $p$ is a string of length $n-1$. It has two children $p0, p1$.\nWe need to choose $c_{p0}, c_{p1} \\in [0, k]$.\nWe also need to choose $c_p \\in [0, k]$.\nThe max count for $p$ is $\\min(c_p, c_{p0} + c_{p1})$.\nSo, $dp[n][j]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_p, c_{p0}, c_{p1}$ such that $\\min(c_p, c_{p0} + c_{p1}) = j$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_{p0}, c_{p1}$ such that $c_{p0} + c_{p1} = S$ is $S+1$ if $S \\le k$, and $2k-S+1$ if $k < S \\le 2k$. Let this be $count\\_sum[S]$.\nThen for a fixed $S$, we need to choose $c_p$.\nIf $c_p \\ge S$, then $\\min(c_p, S) = S$. There are $k-S+1$ choices for $c_p$.\nIf $c_p < S$, then $\\min(c_p, S) = c_p$. There are $S$ choices for $c_p$.\nSo, $dp[n][j] = \\sum_{S=0}^{2k} count\\_sum[S] \\cdot (\\text{ways to choose } c_p \\text{ such that } \\min(c_p, S) = j)$.\nIf $j > k$, then $dp[n][j]=0$ because $c_p \\le k$.\nIf $j \\le k$:\n$dp[n][j] = count\\_sum[j] \\cdot (k-j+1) + \\sum_{S=j+1}^{2k} count\\_sum[S] \\cdot 1$.\nThis is for $dp[n][j]$.\nThis is the base case for one string of length $n-1$.\nThe maximum value $j$ can take is $k$.\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $i, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a *fixed* string $p$ of length $i-1$, such that the maximum prefix count for $p$ is $j$.\nFor $i < n$:\nTo calculate $dp[i][j]$, we need to choose $c_p \\in [0, k]$.\nAnd for $p0$ and $p1$, we need to choose their descendants' $c_s$ values such that their max prefix counts are $j_0$ and $j_1$ respectively.\nThe number of ways to do this for $p0$ is $dp[i+1][j_0]$, and for $p1$ is $dp[i+1][j_1]$.\nSo, for fixed $j_0, j_1$, there are $dp[i+1][j_0] \\cdot dp[i+1][j_1]$ ways.\nThe max count for $p$ is $\\min(c_p, j_0+j_1)$. We want this to be $j$.\nLet $S = j_0+j_1$.\n$dp[i][j] = \\sum_{j_0=0}^k \\sum_{j_1=0}^k dp[i+1][j_0] \\cdot dp[i+1][j_1] \\cdot (\\text{ways to choose } c_p \\text{ such that } \\min(c_p, j_0+j_1) = j)$.\nThe maximum value for $j_0+j_1$ is $2k$.\nLet $P_i[S] = \\sum_{j_0+j_1=S} dp[i+1][j_0] \\cdot dp[i+1][j_1]$. This is a convolution.\nThen $dp[i][j] = \\sum_{S=0}^{2k} P_i[S] \\cdot (\\text{ways to choose } c_p \\text{ such that } \\min(c_p, S) = j)$.\nThe \"ways to choose $c_p$\" part is the same as before:\nIf $j > k$, then $dp[i][j]=0$.\nIf $j \\le k$:\n$dp[i][j] = P_i[j] \\cdot (k-j+1) + \\sum_{S=j+1}^{2k} P_i[S] \\cdot 1$.\n\nThe final answer we need is for $f$.\nThe total number of strings is $N(\\epsilon) = N(0) + N(1)$.\n$N(0)$ is the max prefix count for string \"0\". $N(1)$ is the max prefix count for string \"1\".\nThese are computed using $dp[1][\\cdot]$.\nSo the final answer is $\\sum_{j_0+j_1=f} dp[1][j_0] \\cdot dp[1][j_1]$.\nThe maximum value for $j$ is $k$. So $j_0, j_1 \\le k$.\nThe maximum value for $f$ is $2k$.\n\nLet's refine the definition of $dp[i][j]$.\n$dp[i][j]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $i, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a *fixed* string $p$ of length $i-1$, such that the maximum prefix count for $p$ is $j$.\n$i$ goes from $n$ down to $1$.\nMax value for $j$ is $k$.\n$dp[i]$ is an array of size $k+1$.\n$MOD = 998244353$.\n\nInitialize $dp[n]$:\nFor $j$ from $0$ to $k$:\n  $dp[n][j] = 0$.\n  $P_n[S]$: convolution of counts for $c_{p0}, c_{p1}$.\n  For $S$ from $0$ to $2k$:\n    $P_n[S]$ is the number of pairs $(c_{p0}, c_{p1})$ such that $c_{p0}+c_{p1}=S$.\n    $P_n[S] = \\min(S, k) - \\max(0, S-k) + 1$. (This is $S+1$ for $S \\le k$, and $2k-S+1$ for $S > k$).\n  For $j$ from $0$ to $k$:\n    $dp[n][j] = (P_n[j] \\cdot (k-j+1)) % MOD$.\n    For $S$ from $j+1$ to $2k$:\n      $dp[n][j] = (dp[n][j] + P_n[S]) % MOD$.\n\nIteration for $i$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n  Let $dp\\_prev = dp[i+1]$.\n  Let $P[S]$ be the convolution $dp\\_prev * dp\\_prev$.\n  $P[S] = \\sum_{j_0+j_1=S} dp\\_prev[j_0] \\cdot dp\\_prev[j_1]$.\n  This can be computed using FFT/NTT if $k$ is large, but $k$ is up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$, so $2k$ is $4 \\cdot 10^5$.\n  A direct convolution takes $O(k^2)$ time. For $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $k^2 = 4 \\cdot 10^{10}$, too slow.\n  NTT takes $O(k \\log k)$. $N$ iterations means $O(N k \\log k)$.\n  $N=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$. $15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$.

We want $c_0+c_1=f$.\nThe values $c_0, c_1$ are chosen from $[0, k]$.\nSo we need to find the number of pairs $(c_0, c_1)$ such that $c_0+c_1=f$, and $0 \\le c_0, c_1 \\le k$.\nThis is exactly $P_n[f]$ where $P_n$ is defined for $S=c_{p0}+c_{p1}$.\nThe formula for $P_n[S]$: $\\min(S, k) - \\max(0, S-k) + 1$.\nFor $n=1, k=42, f=2$:\n$P_n[2] = \\min(2, 42) - \\max(0, 2-42) + 1 = 2 - 0 + 1 = 3$.\nThe example output is 3. This matches.\n\nThis means my definition of $dp[i][j]$ for $n=1$ is actually directly computing the final answer.\nIf $n=1$, $dp[1][j]$ is not well-defined by the recursion.\nFor $n=1$, the strings are $0$ and $1$. $c_0, c_1$ are chosen.\nThe max multiset size is $c_0+c_1$.\nThe problem asks for number of ways to choose $c_s$ for $s$ of length $1, \\dots, n$.\nFor $n=1$, this means $c_0, c_1$.\nThe max size is $c_0+c_1$. We want $c_0+c_1=f$.\nThis is just $P_{final}[f]$ where $P_{final}[S] = \\sum_{c_0+c_1=S} 1 \\cdot 1$ for $0 \\le c_0, c_1 \\le k$.\nThis is exactly $\\min(f, k) - \\max(0, f-k) + 1$.\nThis is $P_n[f]$ in my notation.\nSo for $n=1$, the answer is just $P_n[f]$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the DP state:\nLet $dp[L][x]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a *single* string $p$ of length $L-1$, such that the maximum prefix count for $p$ is $x$.\nThis means $p$ is a string of length $L-1$. It has descendants $p0, p1, \\dots$.\nThe $c_s$ values are chosen for $s$ where $p$ is a prefix of $s$ AND length of $s$ is $\\ge L$.\nBase case: $L=n$. $p$ is a string of length $n-1$. Its children are $p0, p1$.\nWe choose $c_{p0}, c_{p1} \\in [0, k]$.\nWe also choose $c_p \\in [0, k]$.\nThe max count for $p$ is $\\min(c_p, c_{p0}+c_{p1})$. We want this to be $x$.\nThis is exactly what $dp[n][x]$ computes.\n$dp[n][x] = \\sum_{S=0}^{2k} P_n[S] \\cdot (\\text{ways to choose } c_p \\text{ such that } \\min(c_p, S) = x)$.\nwhere $P_n[S]$ is the count of pairs $(c_{p0}, c_{p1})$ with sum $S$.\nThis is correct.\n\nRecursive step: $dp[L][x]$ for $L < n$.\n$p$ is a string of length $L-1$. It has children $p0, p1$.\nWe choose $c_p \\in [0, k]$.\nFor $p0$, we choose $c_s$ for its descendants (length $L+1, \\dots, n$) and $c_{p0}$. This gives max count $j_0$. Number of ways is $dp[L+1][j_0]$.\nFor $p1$, similarly, this gives max count $j_1$. Number of ways is $dp[L+1][j_1]$.\nThe max count for $p$ is $\\min(c_p, j_0+j_1)$. We want this to be $x$.\nThis is also correct.\n\nThe final answer calculation:\nThe problem asks for the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset to be exactly $f$.\nThis size is $N(0) + N(1)$.\n$N(0)$ is the maximum prefix count for string \"0\". Its $c_s$ values are chosen for strings $s$ that are descendants of \"0\" (length $1, \\dots, n$).\n$N(1)$ is the maximum prefix count for string \"1\". Its $c_s$ values are chosen for strings $s$ that are descendants of \"1\" (length $1, \\dots, n$).\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ for descendants of \"0\" such that $N(0)=j_0$ is $dp[1][j_0]$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ for descendants of \"1\" such that $N(1)=j_1$ is $dp[1][j_1]$.\nThese choices are independent.\nSo we need $\\sum_{j_0+j_1=f} dp[1][j_0] \\cdot dp[1][j_1]$.\nThis is exactly $P_{final}[f]$ where $P_{final} = dp[1] * dp[1]$.\n\nThis logic seems sound. The $n=1$ case is special because there are no descendants of length $L+1, \\dots, n$ for a string of length $L-1$.\nWhen $n=1$, the strings are \"0\" and \"1\". Length $1$.\nThe $dp$ definition \"strings $s$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a fixed string $p$ of length $L-1$\".\nIf $L=1$, $p$ is of length $0$ (empty string). Its descendants are \"0\" and \"1\".\n$dp[1][j]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for $s \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ such that $N(\\epsilon)=j$.\nBut $N(\\epsilon) = N(0)+N(1)$.\nAnd $N(0)=c_0, N(1)=c_1$ for $n=1$.\nSo $dp[1][j]$ should be $\\sum_{c_0+c_1=j} 1 \\cdot 1$. This is $P_n[j]$ for $n=1$.\nThen the final answer is $P_{final}[f] = (dp[1] * dp[1])[f]$.\nBut if $dp[1][j]$ is already $\\sum_{c_0+c_1=j} 1 \\cdot 1$, then $P_{final}[f]$ would be $\\sum_{j_0+j_1=f} (\\sum_{a+b=j_0} 1) (\\sum_{c+d=j_1} 1)$. This is not right.\n\nThe DP state needs to be more precise for $n=1$.\nFor $n=1$:\nWe choose $c_0 \\in [0, k]$ and $c_1 \\in [0, k]$.\nThe maximum multiset size is $c_0+c_1$.\nWe want $c_0+c_1=f$.\nThe number of ways is $count(c_0+c_1=f)$, which is $\\min(f, k) - \\max(0, f-k) + 1$.\nThis is exactly $P_n[f]$ in my notation.\nSo for $n=1$, the answer is computed by the $P_n[f]$ formula directly.\n\nFor $n > 1$:\nThe $dp[n][j]$ definition is correct. It's for a string $p$ of length $n-1$.\nIt considers $c_p, c_{p0}, c_{p1}$.\nThe $dp[i][j]$ definition for $i < n$ is correct. It considers $c_p$ and the children's max counts.\nThe final answer is $P_{final}[f] = (dp[1] * dp[1])[f]$.\nThis is where $dp[1]$ contains the counts for string \"0\" and \"1\".\n$dp[1][j]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all descendants of \"0\" (length $1, \\dots, n$) such that $N(0)=j$.\nAnd $dp[1][j]$ is also the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all descendants of \"1\" (length $1, \\dots, n$) such that $N(1)=j$.\nThe choices for \"0\" and \"1\" are independent.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n1. If $n=1$, calculate $P_n[f] = \\min(f, k) - \\max(0, f-k) + 1$. This is the answer.\n2. If $n > 1$:\n   a. Initialize $dp\\_curr$ (for $dp[n]$) and $P\\_conv$ (for $P_n$).\n   b. Calculate $P\\_conv[S] = \\min(S, k) - \\max(0, S-k) + 1$ for $S \\in [0, 2k]$. (These are $c_{p0}+c_{p1}$ sums)\n   c. Compute suffix sums of $P\\_conv$: $SufP\\_conv[x] = \\sum_{S=x}^{2k} P\\_conv[S]$.\n   d. For $j \\in [0, k]$: $dp\\_curr[j] = (P\\_conv[j] \\cdot (k-j+1) + SufP\\_conv[j+1]) % MOD$.\n   e. Loop $i$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n      i. $dp\\_prev = dp\\_curr$.\n      ii. Compute $P\\_conv = dp\\_prev * dp\\_prev$ using NTT.\n      iii. Compute suffix sums of $P\\_conv$: $SufP\\_conv[x] = \\sum_{S=x}^{2k} P\\_conv[S]$.\n      iv. For $j \\in [0, k]$: $dp\\_curr[j] = (P\\_conv[j] \\cdot (k-j+1) + SufP\\_conv[j+1]) % MOD$.\n   f. The final answer is $(dp\\_curr * dp\\_curr)[f]$ using NTT.\n\nThis looks correct and robust for $n=1$ as well if we just run the general loop.\nIf $n=1$, the loop for $i$ from $n-1$ down to $1$ is empty.\nThe first step $2a-2d$ computes $dp[n][j]$.\nIf $n=1$, $dp[1][j]$ is computed.\nBut $dp[1][j]$ is defined as ways for string of length $0$ (empty string).\n$dp[1][j]$ is ways for $c_{\\epsilon}, c_0, c_1$ s.t. $\\min(c_{\\epsilon}, c_0+c_1)=j$.\nBut $c_{\\epsilon}$ is not chosen.\nSo the base case $dp[n]$ is for a string of length $n-1$.\nIf $n=1$, then $n-1=0$. So $p$ is the empty string.\nThen $c_p$ is $c_{\\epsilon}$, which is not chosen.\nSo we should modify the $dp[i][j]$ definition.\n$dp[i][j]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $i, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a fixed string $p$ of length $i-1$, such that the maximum prefix count for $p$ is $j$.\nThis definition implies that $c_p$ is chosen.\nThe values $c_s$ are chosen for $s$ of length $1, \\dots, n$.\nSo $c_p$ is chosen if $p$ has length $\\ge 1$.\nIf $p$ has length $0$ (empty string), $c_p$ is not chosen.\n\nLet's adjust the DP state definition.\nLet $dp[L][x]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a *single* string $p$ of length $L-1$, such that the maximum prefix count for $p$ is $x$.\nThis implies $p$ is an internal node.\nThe $c_s$ for $s$ of length $L-1$ is involved in $dp[L][x]$.\nBase case: $L=n$. $p$ is a string of length $n-1$.\nThe choices are $c_{p0}, c_{p1}$ (length $n$) and $c_p$ (length $n-1$).\n$dp[n][x] = \\sum_{S=0}^{2k} P_n[S] \\cdot (\\text{ways to choose } c_p \\text{ such that } \\min(c_p, S) = x)$. This is correct.\n\nThe final answer is $N(0)+N(1)$.\n$N(0)$ is the max prefix count for string \"0\". This is determined by $c_0$ and the max counts for its children.\n$N(1)$ is the max prefix count for string \"1\". This is determined by $c_1$ and the max counts for its children.\nLet $A[j]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for descendants of \"0\" (strings $s$ of length $1, \\dots, n$ such that \"0\" is a prefix of $s$) such that $N(0)=j$.\nThis is $dp[1][j]$.\nThen the final answer is $\\sum_{j_0+j_1=f} A[j_0] \\cdot A[j_1]$. This is $(A*A)[f]$.\nSo the algorithm is correct as stated previously. The $n=1$ case is handled by the general loop.\nFor $n=1$:\n$i$ loop is from $0$ down to $1$. It doesn't run.\nThe initial calculation for $dp\\_curr$ (which corresponds to $dp[n]$) is for $i=n$.\nSo it's $dp[1][j]$.\nThis $dp[1][j]$ is:\n$P\\_conv[S] = \\min(S, k) - \\max(0, S-k) + 1$. These are ways to choose $c_{p0}, c_{p1}$ for children of $p$.\nBut for $n=1$, $p$ is string of length $0$ (empty string). Its children are \"0\" and \"1\".\n$c_{p0}$ corresponds to $c_0$. $c_{p1}$ corresponds to $c_1$.\nSo $P\\_conv[S]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_0, c_1$ such that $c_0+c_1=S$.\nThen $dp\\_curr[j] = (P\\_conv[j] \\cdot (k-j+1) + SufP\\_conv[j+1]) % MOD$.\nHere $p$ is the empty string. $c_p$ refers to $c_{\\epsilon}$. But $c_{\\epsilon}$ is not chosen.\nSo the \"ways to choose $c_p$\" part should not be there.\nThe max count for $p$ (empty string) is $c_0+c_1$.\nSo $dp[1][j]$ for $n=1$ should simply be $P\\_conv[j]$.\nThen the final answer is $P_{final}[f] = (dp[1] * dp[1])[f] = (P\\_conv * P\\_conv)[f]$. This is $\\sum_{S_0+S_1=f} P\\_conv[S_0] \\cdot P\\_conv[S_1]$.\nThis is not $\\min(f,k)-\\max(0,f-k)+1$.\n\nThe issue is that for $n=1$, the strings are $0$ and $1$. We choose $c_0, c_1$. The max size is $c_0+c_1$. We want $c_0+c_1=f$.\nThe number of ways is $P_n[f]$ (using previous $P_n$ definition).\nThis means the DP state definition for $L=1$ (when $n=1$) is different.\n\nCorrected logic for $n=1$:\nThe $c_s$ are chosen for $s \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. Max size is $c_0+c_1$.\nWe want $c_0+c_1=f$.\nNumber of ways: $\\sum_{i=0}^k \\sum_{j=0}^k [i+j=f] = \\min(f,k) - \\max(0,f-k) + 1$.\nThis is simply $P_n[f]$ where $P_n[S]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_0, c_1 \\in [0, k]$ such that $c_0+c_1=S$.\n\nCorrected logic for $n>1$:\nThe $dp[i][j]$ definition holds for $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n$dp[i][j]$: number of ways to choose $c_s$ for $s$ of length $i, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a fixed string $p$ of length $i-1$, such that the maximum prefix count for $p$ is $j$.\nBase case: $i=n$. $p$ is length $n-1$.\n$dp[n][j]$ is calculated as before.\nRecursive step: $i$ from $n-1$ down to $1$.\n$dp[i][j]$ is calculated as before.\nAfter computing $dp[1][j]$:\nThis $dp[1][j]$ represents the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all $s$ of length $1, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of string \"0\", such that $N(0)=j$.\nIt also represents the number of ways for string \"1\", such that $N(1)=j$.\nThe final answer is $\\sum_{j_0+j_1=f} dp[1][j_0] \\cdot dp[1][j_1]$. This is $(dp[1]*dp[1])[f]$.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n1. If $n=1$:\n   Calculate $ans = \\min(f, k) - \\max(0, f-k) + 1$. Print $ans \\pmod{MOD}$.\n2. If $n>1$:\n   a. Initialize $dp\\_curr$ (for $dp[n]$) and $P\\_conv$ (for $P_n$).\n   b. Calculate $P\\_conv[S] = \\min(S, k) - \\max(0, S-k) + 1$ for $S \\in [0, 2k]$.\n   c. Compute suffix sums of $P\\_conv$: $SufP\\_conv[x] = \\sum_{S=x}^{2k} P\\_conv[S]$.\n   d. For $j \\in [0, k]$: $dp\\_curr[j] = (P\\_conv[j] \\cdot (k-j+1) + SufP\\_conv[j+1]) % MOD$.\n   e. Loop $i$ from $n-1$ down to $1$:\n      i. $dp\\_prev = dp\\_curr$.\n      ii. Compute $P\\_conv = dp\\_prev * dp\\_prev$ using NTT.\n      iii. Compute suffix sums of $P\\_conv$: $SufP\\_conv[x] = \\sum_{S=x}^{2k} P\\_conv[S]$.\n      iv. For $j \\in [0, k]$: $dp\\_curr[j] = (P\\_conv[j] \\cdot (k-j+1) + SufP\\_conv[j+1]) % MOD$.\n   f. Compute $P_{final} = dp\\_curr * dp\\_curr$ using NTT.\n   g. Print $P_{final}[f] \\pmod{MOD}$.\n\nThis handles $n=1$ as a special case, and $n>1$ with the general DP.\nThe maximum value of $f$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nThe maximum value of $S$ in $P_{final}$ is $2k$.\nThe maximum value of $j$ in $dp[1]$ is $k$.\nSo $f$ can be at most $2k$.\nThe convolution result $P_{final}$ will have size up to $2k+1$. So $P_{final}[f]$ is well-defined.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    MOD = 998244353\n    PRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n    # NTT implementation\n    def ntt(a, inverse):\n        # N must be a power of 2\n        N = len(a)\n        \n        # Bit-reversal permutation\n        j = 0\n        for i in range(1, N):\n            bit = N >> 1\n            while j >= bit:\n                j -= bit\n                bit >>= 1\n            j += bit\n            if i < j:\n                a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n        for length in range(2, N + 1, 2):\n            half_len = length // 2\n            # Root of unity\n            w_len = pow(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // length, MOD)\n            if inverse:\n                w_len = pow(w_len, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n            for i in range(0, N, length):\n                w = 1\n                for j in range(half_len):\n                    u = a[i + j]\n                    v = (a[i + j + half_len] * w) % MOD\n                    a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                    a[i + j + half_len] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                    w = (w * w_len) % MOD\n\n        if inverse:\n            inv_N = pow(N, MOD - 2, MOD)\n            for i in range(N):\n                a[i] = (a[i] * inv_N) % MOD\n        return a\n\n    def multiply_polynomials(poly1, poly2):\n        deg1 = len(poly1) - 1\n        deg2 = len(poly2) - 1\n        \n        # Calculate N, the smallest power of 2 greater than deg1 + deg2\n        N = 1\n        while N <= deg1 + deg2:\n            N <<= 1\n        \n        a = list(poly1) + [0] * (N - len(poly1))\n        b = list(poly2) + [0] * (N - len(poly2))\n        \n        ntt(a, False)\n        ntt(b, False)\n        \n        c = [(x * y) % MOD for x, y in zip(a, b)]\n        \n        ntt(c, True)\n        \n        # Trim leading zeros if any, result degree is deg1 + deg2\n        return c[:deg1 + deg2 + 1]\n\n    if n == 1:\n        # For n=1, we choose c_0 and c_1 such that c_0+c_1=f, 0 <= c_0, c_1 <= k\n        # This is sum_{i=0 to k} sum_{j=0 to k} [i+j=f]\n        # Number of solutions to i+j=f with 0 <= i, j <= k\n        ans = min(f, k) - max(0, f - k) + 1\n        print(ans % MOD)\n        return\n\n    # dp_curr[j] will store dp[i][j]\n    # P_conv[S] will store sum of dp[i+1][j0] * dp[i+1][j1] where j0+j1=S\n    \n    # Max sum for two children is 2k.
