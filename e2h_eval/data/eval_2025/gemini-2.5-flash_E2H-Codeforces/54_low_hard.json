Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Finding the Best Inscribed Angle**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to locate three vertices (v1, v2, v3) on a regular convex n-gon that form an angle (v1-v2-v3) as close as possible to a target angle 'a'.  The key here is understanding the geometry.\n\nFirst, I realize that all the vertices of the n-gon sit neatly on a circumcircle. The angle I'm interested in is an inscribed angle. And, as I remember, the measure of an inscribed angle is exactly half the measure of the arc it cuts out.  The arc in question is the one defined by v1 and v3 *but not* containing v2.\n\nNow, let's fix a vertex; it won't matter which, and call it v2. Numbering the vertices clockwise from 1 to n makes life easier.  I'll label the vertices as 1 to n, and assume v2 is at the origin (vertex 1). Then, I just need to find two other vertices, v1 (let's say it's vertex *i*) and v3 (vertex *j*).\n\nThe central angle of a single side of the n-gon is simply 360 / n degrees. The arc between any two vertices is determined by the number of sides between them. If there are *k* sides between vertices *x* and *y*, the central angle is *k*(360/n) and the inscribed angle is half of that, so *k*(180/n).\n\nLet's generalize this a bit. Suppose v2 is at vertex *P*, v1 at *L*, and v3 at *R*. The angle *LPR* subtends the arc from *L* to *R* that doesn't include *P*.  The number of edges on the arc from *L* to *R* (going clockwise) can be calculated as  *(R - L + n) % n*.  And it's this number of edges that defines the subtended arc, and therefore the angle. I can use this to loop through possible vertices to find the angle that is closest to my target value, 'a'.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 of a regular convex n-gon such that the angle v1-v2-v3 (with v2 as the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output the vertices 1-indexed.\n\nAll vertices of a regular n-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices of a polygon, where the middle vertex is on the circumcircle, is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n\nLet's label the vertices of the n-gon from 1 to n in clockwise order.\nConsider an angle formed by vertices v1, v2, v3, where v2 is the vertex of the angle.\nWithout loss of generality, let's fix v2 to be vertex 2.\nLet v1 be vertex 1.\nThen v3 must be some vertex `k`, where `k` is distinct from 1 and 2.\nThe angle 1-2-k subtends the arc from vertex 1 to vertex `k` that does not contain vertex 2.\n\nThe central angle subtended by one side of a regular n-gon is `360/n` degrees.\nIf an arc consists of `m` sides, its central angle is `m * (360/n)`.\nThe inscribed angle subtending this arc is `(m * (360/n)) / 2 = m * (180/n)` degrees.\n\nIn our setup, with v2 fixed at vertex 2 and v1 fixed at vertex 1, the other endpoint of the arc is v3, which can be any vertex `k` from 3 to `n`.\nThe number of sides `m` on the arc from vertex 1 to vertex `k` (going clockwise along the shorter path that doesn't include vertex 2) is `k - 1`.\nSo, for a chosen `k`, the angle 1-2-k will be `(k - 1 - 1) * (180/n)` if we consider the arc from vertex 1 to vertex k skipping vertex 2.\nMore generally, if v2 is vertex `j`, v1 is vertex `i`, and v3 is vertex `k`.\nThe number of edges on the arc from `i` to `k` (not containing `j`) is `m`.\nThe angle is `m * (180/n)`.\nIf we fix v2 to be vertex 2, and v1 to be vertex 1.\nThen v3 can be any vertex `k` from 3 to `n`.\nThe arc subtended by angle 1-2-k is the arc from vertex 1 to vertex `k` that does not contain vertex 2.\nThe number of edges on this arc is `k - 1`.\nSo the angle is `(k - 1) * (180/n)`.\nNo, this is incorrect. The number of edges on the arc is `k-1` if we go clockwise from 1 to k. This arc contains vertex 2.\nThe correct way: The angle 1-2-k subtends the arc (1, k) that does not contain 2.\nThe vertices are 1, 2, ..., n.\nIf v2 is vertex `P`, v1 is vertex `L`, v3 is vertex `R`.\nThe number of edges on the arc between `L` and `R` (not containing `P`) determines the angle.\nLet's pick vertex 1 as v2.\nThen v1 and v3 can be any other two vertices.\nLet v1 be vertex 2.\nThen v3 can be any vertex `k` from 3 to `n`.\nThe angle 2-1-k subtends the arc (2, k) that does not contain 1.\nThe number of edges on this arc is `k - 2`.\nSo the possible angles are `(k - 2) * (180/n)` for `k` from 3 to `n`.\nThis means `m` can range from `1` to `n-2`.\nFor `k=3`, `m=1`, angle is `1 * (180/n)`.\nFor `k=n`, `m=n-2`, angle is `(n-2) * (180/n)`. This is the maximum possible angle in a regular n-gon, which is the internal angle of the polygon.\n\nSo, the set of all possible angles that can be formed by three vertices of a regular n-gon are `j * (180/n)` degrees, where `j` is an integer from `1` to `n-2`.\nWe need to find `j` such that `|j * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\n\nLet `target_j = a / (180/n) = (a * n) / 180`.\nWe are looking for an integer `j` in `[1, n-2]` that is closest to `target_j`.\nThere are two candidates for `j`: `floor(target_j)` and `ceil(target_j)`.\nLet `j1 = floor(target_j)` and `j2 = ceil(target_j)`.\n\nWe must ensure `j1` and `j2` are within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n1. If `j1 < 1`: We should use `j = 1`. This happens when `target_j < 1`. The closest possible angle is `1 * (180/n)`.\n2. If `j2 > n-2`: We should use `j = n-2`. This happens when `target_j > n-2`. The closest possible angle is `(n-2) * (180/n)`.\n3. Otherwise, both `j1` and `j2` are valid candidates. We compare `|j1 * (180/n) - a|` and `|j2 * (180/n) - a|` and choose the `j` that gives the minimum absolute difference.\n\nAfter finding the optimal `j`, we can construct the vertices:\nLet v2 be vertex 1.\nLet v1 be vertex 2.\nThen v3 must be vertex `2 + j`.\nThe vertices are 1-indexed, so `v1 = 2`, `v2 = 1`, `v3 = 2 + j`.\nThese are distinct vertices because `j >= 1`. So `2+j >= 3`.\nThe chosen `j` is at most `n-2`. So `2+j <= 2 + (n-2) = n`.\nAll vertices are within the range `[1, n]` and are distinct.\n\nExample 1: n=3, a=15\n`180/n = 180/3 = 60`.\nPossible `j` values: `[1, n-2] = [1, 1]`. So `j=1` is the only option.\nAngle = `1 * 60 = 60`.\n`|60 - 15| = 45`.\nOptimal `j=1`.\nv2=1, v1=2, v3=2+1=3. Output: `2 1 3`. (The sample output is `1 2 3`. Both are valid. My choice `2 1 3` forms angle 60 degrees. `1 2 3` also forms 60 degrees. Any permutation of these three vertices as long as the middle one is the vertex of the angle is fine. For example, if we pick v2=2, v1=1, v3=3, this forms angle 1-2-3, which is 60 degrees.)\n\nExample 2: n=4, a=67\n`180/n = 180/4 = 45`.\nPossible `j` values: `[1, n-2] = [1, 2]`.\n`target_j = (67 * 4) / 180 = 268 / 180 = 1.488...`\n`j1 = floor(1.488...) = 1`. Angle = `1 * 45 = 45`. Difference = `|45 - 67| = 22`.\n`j2 = ceil(1.488...) = 2`. Angle = `2 * 45 = 90`. Difference = `|90 - 67| = 23`.\nMinimum difference is 22, so optimal `j=1`.\nv2=1, v1=2, v3=2+1=3. Output: `2 1 3`. (Sample output: `2 1 3`).\n\nExample 3: n=4, a=68\n`180/n = 45`.\nPossible `j` values: `[1, 2]`.\n`target_j = (68 * 4) / 180 = 272 / 180 = 1.511...`\n`j1 = floor(1.511...) = 1`. Angle = `1 * 45 = 45`. Difference = `|45 - 68| = 23`.\n`j2 = ceil(1.511...) = 2`. Angle = `2 * 45 = 90`. Difference = `|90 - 68| = 22`.\nMinimum difference is 22, so optimal `j=2`.\nv2=1, v1=2, v3=2+2=4. Output: `2 1 4`. (Sample output: `4 1 2`). Both `2 1 4` and `4 1 2` form angle 90 degrees.\n\nThe logic seems sound.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # The possible angles are of the form j * (180/n) degrees,\n    # where j is an integer from 1 to n-2.\n    # We want to find j such that |j * (180/n) - a| is minimized.\n\n    angle_unit = 180.0 / n\n\n    # Calculate the ideal j (not necessarily an integer)\n    target_j_float = a / angle_unit\n\n    # Consider two integer candidates for j: floor(target_j_float) and ceil(target_j_float)\n    j_cand1 = math.floor(target_j_float)\n    j_cand2 = math.ceil(target_j_float)\n\n    # Ensure candidates are within the valid range [1, n-2]\n    # The smallest possible j is 1.
