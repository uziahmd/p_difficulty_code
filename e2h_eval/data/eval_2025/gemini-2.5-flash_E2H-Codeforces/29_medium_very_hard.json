Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing a Competitive Programming String Transformation Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem in front of me: a string `s` of digits, a bunch of replacement queries \"di->ti\", and I need the final value of the resulting string modulo 1000000007. The tricky part? The string `s` can explode in size if I'm not careful. A naive string replacement approach would be a disaster, eating up memory and time.\n\nMy first thought is to avoid building the massive string altogether. Instead, I need to figure out how each digit in the original string contributes to the final number. Let's define `val[d]` as the numerical value contributed by digit `d` and `len[d]` as its length *after all* the transformations. Initially, these are just the digit itself: `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1`.\n\nThe queries are the key. If I process them in the order given, I'm going to get tangled in dependencies. A digit `d1` might become a string that contains another digit `d2`, which is itself transformed later. So I need to process these queries *backwards*. This ensures that by the time I'm replacing a digit, I've already figured out the *final* values and lengths of all the digits it might become.\n\nOkay, let's step through the logic. I'll maintain `current_val[d]` and `current_len[d]` for each digit `d`. When I encounter a query \"di->ti\", I need to update `current_val[di]` and `current_len[di]` based on the current values of the digits *within* `ti`.\n\nLet's say `ti` is \"abc\". The new value of `di` is then derived from the recursive formula:\n`Value(T) = (Value(a) * 10^(Length(b) + Length(c)) + Value(b) * 10^(Length(c)) + Value(c))` and `Length(T) = Length(a) + Length(b) + Length(c)`\nI'm doing this calculation modulo 1000000007, and I need the lengths modulo 1000000006 for the exponents. This is where I use Fermat's Little Theorem to avoid really large exponents.\n\nAfter processing all queries, I iterate through the *original* string `s`.  For each digit, I'll multiply my `final_ans` by 10 to the power of the digit's length, add the digit's value, and keep everything modulo 1000000007.\n\nThe code reflects this thinking: I store value and length for each digit, iterate backward through the queries, update values and lengths based on the replacement strings, and then build the final number by iterating through the original string. This is going to avoid that string explosion and be nice and efficient. I'm leveraging modular arithmetic properties throughout, and making sure the `pow` function is taking modular exponentiation into account.  Let's hope this passes the test cases!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The key challenges are that the string `s` can become extremely long (exponentially), making direct string manipulation infeasible, and the replacements are sequential, meaning `A -> B` followed by `B -> C` effectively makes `A -> C` (or `A -> B'` where `B'` is `B` with its `B`s replaced by `C`s).\n\nTo overcome the exponential growth of the string, we use a technique where we track the *effective value* and *effective length* of each digit (0-9) after all transformations.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`. This is a prime number.\nWhen calculating `10^L` modulo `MOD`, where `L` can be very large, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. For a prime modulus `p`, `a^b % p = a^(b % (p-1)) % p` for `b > 0` and `a` not a multiple of `p`. If `b = 0`, `a^0 % p = 1`. Python's `pow(base, exp, mod)` function handles this correctly: if `exp` is large, it effectively computes `exp % (mod-1)` for prime `mod`. So, we need to track lengths modulo `MOD - 1`. Let `MOD_L = MOD - 1 = 1000000006`.\n\nWe'll maintain two arrays:\n1. `current_val[d]`: The numerical value that a single digit `d` contributes to the final number, modulo `MOD`.\n2. `current_len[d]`: The length of the string representation that a single digit `d` contributes to the final number, modulo `MOD_L`. This length will be used as the exponent for powers of 10.\n\n**Initialization:**\nInitially, before any queries, each digit `d` represents itself and has a length of 1.\nSo, for `d` from 0 to 9:\n`current_val[d] = d`\n`current_len[d] = 1`\n\n**Processing Queries:**\nThe order of queries is crucial. If query `Q1: d1 -> t1` happens, and then `Q2: d2 -> t2` happens, and `d2` appears in `t1`, then `d2` in `t1` should be replaced by `t2`. This implies that the transformations are applied to the *current* string `s`. This dependency structure suggests processing queries in **reverse order**.\nWhen we process a query `di -> ti` in reverse, it means we are determining what an *original* `di` will become. Any digits `c` appearing in `ti` will already have their `current_val[c]` and `current_len[c]` updated to reflect all *subsequent* transformations (which are earlier in the reverse processing order).\n\nFor each query `di -> ti` (processed from last to first):\n1. Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n2. Iterate through each character `char_t` in the string `ti`:\n   a. Convert `char_t` to an integer `d_t`.\n   b. Get the current effective value `val_t = current_val[d_t]` and effective length `len_t = current_len[d_t]`.\n   c. Update `new_val_di`: The value of `ti` is built up by concatenating the values of its constituent parts. If `new_val_di` is the value accumulated so far for the prefix of `ti`, and we append `val_t` (which has length `len_t`), the new value is `(new_val_di * 10^(len_t) + val_t) % MOD`. We use `pow(10, len_t, MOD)` for this.\n   d. Update `new_len_di`: The total length is the sum of individual lengths. `new_len_di = (new_len_di + len_t) % MOD_L`.\n3. After iterating through all characters in `ti`, update `current_val[di] = new_val_di` and `current_len[di] = new_len_di`.\n   *Special case*: If `ti` is an empty string, `new_val_di` and `new_len_di` will remain `0`. This correctly represents that the digit `di` effectively disappears, contributing 0 to the value and 0 to the length.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `current_val[d]` and `current_len[d]` hold the final effective value and length for each digit `d` in the original string `s`.\n1. Initialize `final_ans = 0`.\n2. Iterate through each character `char_s` in the initial string `s`:\n   a. Convert `char_s` to an integer `d_s`.\n   b. Get its final effective value `val_s = current_val[d_s]` and length `len_s = current_len[d_s]`.\n   c. Update `final_ans`: Similar to the query processing, `final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, len_s, MOD) + val_s) % MOD`.\n3. The result `final_ans` is the answer. This approach correctly handles leading zeros (e.g., \"007\" will be `7`) and empty strings (which result in `0`).\n\n**Complexity:**\n- Time: `O((sum(|ti|) + |s|) * log(MOD))`. `sum(|ti|)` is the total length of all replacement strings, `|s|` is the length of the initial string. `log(MOD)` comes from the `pow` function. Given constraints `sum(|ti|) <= 10^5` and `|s| <= 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n- Space: `O(sum(|ti|) + |s|)` to store the input strings and queries. The `current_val` and `current_len` arrays are `O(10)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the modulo constants\nMOD = 1000000007\nMOD_L = 1000000006 # For exponents in powers of 10.
