You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Replacing Digits\" problem, and the goal is clear: maximize the value of a number `a` by replacing some of its digits with digits from a sequence `s`.  Each digit from `s` can only be used once. I need to come up with a Python script to do this efficiently.\n\nMy strategy is to build the largest possible number from left to right.  That means focusing on the most significant digits first. I figure the best approach will be:\n\n1.  **Iterate through the digits of `a`:**  I'll go from left to right, one digit at a time.\n2.  **Sort `s`:** To easily find the largest replacement digit, I'll sort the digits in `s` in descending order. This makes it a quick lookup.\n3.  **Find a Suitable Replacement:** For each digit in `a`, I'll check if there's a larger digit available in `s`.  If there is, I replace the current digit in `a` with the *largest* suitable digit from `s`. I need to be careful to mark the digit as \"used\" so I don't use it again.\n4.  **No Replacement?** If there's no larger digit in `s`, I leave the digit in `a` as is.\n\nI need to make sure to convert `a` to something I can manipulate like a list of characters, and then convert it back at the end. I also need to think about how I'm going to track which digits from `s` are used. Maybe removing them from the sorted list or using a list of booleans to mark them. It seems pretty straightforward; iterate through `a`, iterate through `s`, replace if possible, and build the solution digit by digit. It makes sense to me.\n",
