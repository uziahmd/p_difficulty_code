    "thought": "**Analyzing the Longest Repeated Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for a competitive programming problem. The goal is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice within a given string. Overlapping occurrences are allowed, and the string consists of lowercase Latin letters with a length between 1 and 100.\n\nMy initial thought is to break this down. First, I need to consider all possible substring lengths. Since a substring cannot be longer than the input string, I'll iterate lengths from 1 up to N-1 (where N is the string's length). If the substring equals the original string, it cannot appear twice.\n\nFor each length, I'll need to generate all possible substrings of that length. A string of length N will have (N - L + 1) substrings of length L. Then, I need to count how many times each of these substrings appears in the original string. I could do this by finding all occurrences of each substring. Finally, I'll keep track of the maximum length found so far.\n\nI think there might be a more efficient approach, though. What if I iterate through all possible starting positions for the first occurrence of a substring, and then, for each starting position, I iterate through all possible starting positions for the second occurrence, where the second starting position is greater than the first? For each pair of starting positions, I can find the length of the longest common prefix between the substrings starting at those positions. This would give me a substring common to both, and the maximum of these lengths would be the answer.\n\nLet's test this second approach with the example string \"ababa\". For i = 0, and j = 2, the common prefix will be \"aba\". If i = 1, j= 3, the common prefix is \"ba\". I think this method should work, and the example output shows that it does. I'll need to be careful with edge cases, but I think this is a pretty solid strategy.\n",
