His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing Vasya's Olympiad Rank: A Strategy Unveiled**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Olympiad ranking problem. The goal is to figure out Vasya's best and worst possible ranks given his minimum total score, the scores from the first and second tours, and the total number of participants. The crucial thing here is that we only have the scores, not the individual participant data. That means I need to figure out how to pair the scores from the two tours strategically.\n\nMy first thought is that I need to find permutations of the tour scores to create individual scores. Each participant has a total score, and the ranking is based on these totals. Ties are resolved by the jury, so that gives me some flexibility in calculating best/worst.\n\nTo calculate the best rank, I want to make Vasya's total as high as possible. *And* I want to ensure that as few other participants as possible have a higher score. So, it's about finding the *optimal* pairing. This is where it gets interesting... I need to find a pairing where the sum of Vasya's first and second tour scores is at least 'x'. I need to find the specific pairings of the scores that satisfy the condition that Vasya's total is at least 'x'.\nI'm thinking I should start by looking at all the possible valid combinations of first and second tour scores that give Vasya at least 'x' points. Then I can figure out how to arrange the scores to minimize the participants that score higher, therefore, maximizing Vasya's score and improving his rank. It sounds like an optimization problem, right?\n\nI will need to consider maximizing Vasya's score without making everyone else's score worse off. The strategy here is not just about choosing high scores for Vasya but arranging things to minimize those who will place higher than him. I need to get started on the algorithm that helps me sort and pair these scores intelligently to achieve the desired rank.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad, given the scores from two tours and a minimum total score `x` Vasya obtained. We don't know which scores belong to which participant, only the pools of scores for each tour.\n\nLet `n` be the number of participants, `x` be Vasya's minimum total score, `a` be the list of scores from the first tour, and `b` be the list of scores from the second tour.\n\n**Understanding the Ranking Rules:**\n1.  Participants are sorted by the sum of points for both tours (highest sum gets the best rank).\n2.  If multiple participants have the same total score, the jury assigns places. This means:\n    *   For the best rank: If Vasya ties with `k` others, he can be assigned the best rank among them. This means he is ranked higher than anyone with a strictly greater score, and ties with anyone with the same score.\n    *   For the worst rank: If Vasya ties with `k` others, he can be assigned the worst rank among them. This means he is ranked higher than anyone with a strictly greater score, and worse than anyone with the same score.\n\n**Key Insight for Pairing:**\nTo determine ranks, we need to form `n` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that each `a_i` and `b_j` is used exactly once. The total score for a participant is `a_i + b_j`.\n\n**1. Finding Vasya's Best Possible Rank:**\n\nTo achieve the best rank, we want to:\n*   Maximize Vasya's total score.\n*   Minimize the number of participants who score strictly more than Vasya.\n*   If Vasya ties with others, he gets the best rank among them.\n\nConsider sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\nIf we pair `a_i` with `b_{n-1-i}` (i.e., `a_0` with `b_{n-1}`, `a_1` with `b_{n-2}`, etc.), this strategy tends to equalize the sums, or at least keep them within a smaller range than pairing smallest with smallest or largest with largest. This is a common strategy in competitive programming for problems involving pairing elements to minimize/maximize something related to sums/differences.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.\n`a = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]` (sorted ascending)\n`b = [b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}]` (sorted descending)\n\nConsider pairing `a_i` with `b_i`. This pairing strategy `(a_i, b_i)` is useful because it maximizes the sum of minimums (or minimizes the sum of maximums).\nIf we pair `a_i` with `b_i` for all `i`, this forms `n` total scores `s_i = a_i + b_i`.\nIt can be proven that this pairing strategy `(a_i, b_i)` (where `a` is sorted ascending and `b` is sorted descending) finds a set of total scores such that for any other valid pairing, the set of scores `s'_j` can be rearranged such that `s_j <= s'_j` for all `j`. This means this pairing strategy tends to produce *lower* total scores for most participants.\n\nLet's use this pairing: sort `a` ascending, sort `b` descending. Create `n` pairs `(a_i, b_i)` and their sums `s_i = a_i + b_i`.\nNow, we need to find Vasya's best possible score. Since Vasya must have scored at least `x`, he must be one of the participants whose sum `s_i >= x`. To maximize his score, he would take the highest sum `s_i` that satisfies `s_i >= x`.\nHowever, the problem is about *which* `a_i` and `b_j` are Vasya's. We can construct a scenario where Vasya gets a very high score.\nThe best rank scenario for Vasya:\nVasya takes the highest possible `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nTo maximize Vasya's score, he takes `max(a)` and `max(b)`. His score would be `max(a) + max(b)`.\nThe other `n-1` participants are paired greedily to minimize their scores, to make it easier for Vasya to be first.\nThis doesn't quite work because `a_i` and `b_j` are *fixed* for Vasya. We don't know which ones they are.\n\nThe problem asks for *the* best rank Vasya could have won. This implies we can choose a pairing for *all* participants such that Vasya gets the best possible rank.\nTo find Vasya's best rank, we need to count how many participants could *definitely* score more than him, and how many could *definitely* score the same as him.\nThis is a maximum matching problem if thought of differently.\n\nA simpler approach for the best rank:\nVasya's best rank is 1. Can he achieve it?\nYes, if there's a way to pair scores such that Vasya gets the highest total score, and his score is at least `x`.\nTo make Vasya score as high as possible, he takes `max(a)` and `max(b)`. His score is `max(a) + max(b)`.\nTo make other participants score as low as possible:\nPair `min(a)` with `min(b)` (from remaining elements), etc.\nThis is exactly what sorting `a` ascending and `b` ascending, then pairing `a_i` with `b_i` (or `a_i` with `b_{n-1-i}`), does.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\nTo find the best rank, we want to maximize Vasya's score and minimize others' scores.\nThis means Vasya takes `a_i` and `b_j` that result in a high sum. The other `n-1` participants should be paired to get low sums.\nThis is best achieved by pairing the remaining `n-1` largest `a` values with the `n-1` smallest `b` values, or vice-versa.\n\nConsider the minimum possible score for any participant. This is `min(a) + min(b)`.\nConsider the maximum possible score for any participant. This is `max(a) + max(b)`.\nSince Vasya got at least `x` points, and it's guaranteed that some `a_i + b_j >= x`, Vasya can always choose `a_i = max(a)` and `b_j = max(b)`. His score would be `max(a) + max(b)`.\nIf `max(a) + max(b) < x`, then Vasya cannot have this score. But the problem guarantees that *some* `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nSo, if Vasya takes `max(a)` and `max(b)`, his score is `S_V = max(a) + max(b)`.\nThe remaining `n-1` values in `a` and `n-1` values in `b` are paired. The lowest possible scores for the other participants are achieved by pairing the smallest remaining `a` with the smallest remaining `b`, etc.\nHowever, this is not how it works. We must use *all* `a_i` and `b_j` exactly once.\n\nLet's use the standard approach for finding best/worst ranks in such problems:\nSort `a` in ascending order. Sort `b` in ascending order.\nTo find Vasya's best rank:\nWe want to maximize Vasya's score. Vasya can pick any `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. To maximize his score, he picks the largest `a_i` and largest `b_j` from the available pools. So Vasya's score is `a[n-1] + b[n-1]`. (Let's assume `a` and `b` are 0-indexed and sorted ascending).\nIf `a[n-1] + b[n-1] < x`, this choice is invalid for Vasya.\nThe problem guarantees that *some* `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nSo, Vasya can achieve at least `x` points.\n\nFor the best rank, we want to find a pairing `P = {(A_k, B_k)}` such that for one participant `V = (A_V, B_V)` (Vasya), `A_V + B_V >= x`, and `A_V + B_V` is as high as possible, and other participants' scores are as low as possible.\nIt is always possible for Vasya to take `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`. His score will be `a[n-1] + b[n-1]`.\nIf this score is less than `x`, then it's not Vasya's score.\nThe problem statement implies that Vasya *is* one of the participants, and his score `A_V + B_V >= x`.\nTo achieve the best rank, Vasya should aim for the highest possible score. This is `a[n-1] + b[n-1]`. If this sum is less than `x`, then the guarantee `a_i + b_j >= x` means that this specific pairing `(a[n-1], b[n-1])` is not Vasya's, or the problem statement is slightly tricky.\nThe guarantee \"there are two integers i, j (1 <= i, j <= n) such, that ai + bj >= x\" means that *it is possible* for Vasya to get `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nSo, to maximize Vasya's score, he takes `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`. His score is `S_V = a[n-1] + b[n-1]`.\nIf `S_V < x`, this is a contradiction with the guarantee. So `a[n-1] + b[n-1]` must be at least `x`.\nThus, Vasya can always achieve `a[n-1] + b[n-1]` points.\nThe other `n-1` participants are paired using `a[0...n-2]` and `b[0...n-2]`. To minimize their scores, we pair `a[i]` with `b[i]`.\nSo the scores for the other participants are `a[0]+b[0], a[1]+b[1], ..., a[n-2]+b[n-2]`.\nAll these scores are less than or equal to `a[n-1]+b[n-1]` (since `a_i <= a_{n-1}` and `b_i <= b_{n-1}`).\nTherefore, Vasya can always be rank 1.\nThis is because he can take the two highest scores, `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`. His total is `a[n-1] + b[n-1]`.\nAll other participants must take smaller `a`s and `b`s. The sums `a_i + b_j` for `i,j < n-1` will always be less than or equal to `a[n-1] + b[n-1]`.\nSo, Vasya can always be 1st.\nBest rank = 1.\n\n**2. Finding Vasya's Worst Possible Rank:**\n\nTo achieve the worst rank, we want to:\n*   Minimize Vasya's total score (but it must be at least `x`).\n*   Maximize the number of participants who score strictly more than Vasya.\n*   If Vasya ties with others, he gets the worst rank among them.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order.\n`a = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]`\n`b = [b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n-1}]`\n\nTo maximize the number of people scoring higher than Vasya, we want to create as many high scores as possible for other participants. This is achieved by pairing the largest `a` values with the largest `b` values.\nSo, we pair `a_{n-1}` with `b_{n-1}`, `a_{n-2}` with `b_{n-2}`, and so on.\nThis creates `n` pairs `(a_i, b_i)` and their sums `s_i = a_i + b_i`.\nNow, we need to assign these sums to participants, one of whom is Vasya.\nVasya must be assigned a sum `s_k` such that `s_k >= x`.\nTo get the worst rank, Vasya should take the *smallest* `s_k` that is still `>= x`.\nLet's collect all possible sums from this pairing strategy: `S = {a_i + b_i | for i in 0...n-1}`.\nSort `S` in descending order: `S_0 >= S_1 >= ... >= S_{n-1}`.\nVasya's score must be `s_k >= x`. To get the worst rank, he takes the smallest such `s_k`.\nLet `S_V_worst` be the smallest value in `S` that is `>= x`.\nNow, we count how many participants scored strictly more than `S_V_worst`. Let this count be `C_greater`.\nWe also count how many participants scored exactly `S_V_worst`. Let this count be `C_equal`.\nVasya's rank will be `C_greater + C_equal`. (He gets the worst rank among those tied with him).\n\nExample: `n=5, x=2`. `a=[1,1,1,1,1]`, `b=[1,1,1,1,1]`.\nSorted `a`: `[1,1,1,1,1]`\nSorted `b`: `[1,1,1,1,1]`\nPairing `a_i` with `b_i`:\nSums: `1+1=2, 1+1=2, 1+1=2, 1+1=2, 1+1=2`.\nAll sums are `2`.\nVasya's score must be `>= x=2`. The smallest sum satisfying this is `2`.\nScores strictly greater than `2`: `0` participants.\nScores equal to `2`: `5` participants.\nWorst rank = `0 + 5 = 5`.\n\nExample: `n=6, x=7`. `a=[4,3,5,6,4,4]`, `b=[8,6,0,4,3,4]`.\nSorted `a`: `[3,4,4,4,5,6]`\nSorted `b`: `[0,3,4,4,6,8]`\nPairing `a_i` with `b_i`:\n`3+0=3`\n`4+3=7`\n`4+4=8`\n`4+4=8`\n`5+6=11`\n`6+8=14`\nThese are the sums: `[3, 7, 8, 8, 11, 14]`.\nSorted descending: `[14, 11, 8, 8, 7, 3]`.\nVasya's score must be `>= x=7`.\nPossible scores for Vasya: `14, 11, 8, 8, 7`.\nTo get the worst rank, Vasya takes the smallest of these: `7`.\nScores strictly greater than `7`: `14, 11, 8, 8`. Count = `4`.\nScores equal to `7`: `7`. Count = `1`.\nWorst rank = `4 + 1 = 5`.\n\nThis strategy (sort both `a` and `b` ascending, then pair `a_i` with `b_i`) is known to be the \"worst-case\" pairing in terms of rank for a specific participant. It creates a set of sums that are \"spread out\" as much as possible, allowing for many participants to score higher than Vasya if Vasya takes a relatively low score (but still satisfying `x`).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `x`.\n2.  Read list `a`.\n3.  Read list `b`.\n4.  Sort `a` in ascending order.\n5.  Sort `b` in ascending order.\n6.  Calculate `n` sums `s_i = a_i + b_i` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Store them in a list `sums`.\n7.  Sort `sums` in descending order.\n8.  Find Vasya's worst rank:\n    *   Iterate through `sums`. Find the smallest `s_k` such that `s_k >= x`. This is Vasya's score in the worst-case scenario. Let's call it `vasya_score_worst`.\n    *   Count how many participants have scores strictly greater than `vasya_score_worst`. Let this be `count_greater`.\n    *   Count how many participants have scores equal to `vasya_score_worst`. Let this be `count_equal`.\n    *   Vasya's worst rank is `count_greater + count_equal`.\n\n**Why this pairing for worst rank?**\nConsider two sorted lists `A` and `B`. To maximize the number of people who score higher than a specific value `X`, we want to create as many sums `a_i + b_j` that are greater than `X` as possible.\nThe pairing `(a_i, b_i)` (both sorted ascending) is a valid pairing.\nThe key is that for any `k`, the `k` largest sums `a_i + b_i` (from this pairing) are as large as possible compared to any other pairing. Similarly, the `k` smallest sums are as small as possible.\nBy pairing `a_i` with `b_i` (both sorted ascending), we create a set of sums. Vasya then takes the smallest sum `S_V` from this set that is `>= x`. All participants who got sums `s > S_V` will rank strictly higher than Vasya. All participants who got sums `s = S_V` will also rank higher than Vasya in the worst-case scenario (jury decision). This maximizes Vasya's rank.\n\n**Final Check:**\n*   Best rank: Always 1. Vasya can pick `max(a)` and `max(b)`. His score will be `max(a) + max(b)`. The problem guarantees that there exists `a_i, b_j` such that `a_i+b_j >= x`. If `max(a) + max(b) < x`, it would contradict this guarantee, as Vasya would not be able to achieve `x` points. So `max(a) + max(b) >= x`. With this score, Vasya is guaranteed to be at least tied for first, and thus can claim rank 1.\n*   Worst rank: Calculate `sums = [a[i] + b[i] for i in range(n)]` after sorting `a` and `b` ascending. Sort `sums` descending. Find the smallest `s` in `sums` that is `>= x`. Let this be `vasya_score`. Count how many elements in `sums` are `>= vasya_score`. This is Vasya's worst rank.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best rank for Vasya is always 1.\n    # Vasya can choose the highest score from tour 1 and the highest score from tour 2.\n    # Let Vasya's scores be max(a) and max(b).
