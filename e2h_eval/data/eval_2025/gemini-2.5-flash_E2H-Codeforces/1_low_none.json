The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My Approach to Calculating Gilded Cells**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to figure out the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. Let's break this down systematically. First, I have the plate dimensions, `w` for width and `h` for height. No ambiguity there, the problem is explicit. Now, there are `k` gilded rings. The first ring covers the entire perimeter.  Each subsequent ring gets smaller, forming an inner rectangle within the previous one. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n\nMy goal is to calculate the total number of cells gilded across all `k` rings.  I think the best way to do this is to iterate through each ring, determine the dimensions of its inner rectangle, and then calculate the number of cells in that ring.\n\nFor ring `i`, the inner rectangle will have dimensions `current_w = w - 4(i - 1)` and `current_h = h - 4(i - 1)`. Since each ring is one cell thick, the number of cells in the `i`-th ring should be `2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`. This accounts for the top and bottom rows, the left and right columns, and subtracts the four corner cells that are double-counted. I need to make sure this works even as the inner rectangles shrink.\n\nNow, the problem constraints state that `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)`. This seems important. The dimension of the inner rectangle will decrease by 4 with each ring. So for ring `k`, the dimensions are `w - 4(k-1)` and `h - 4(k-1)`. Let `m_val` equal the minimum of `w` and `h`. We know that `4k <= m_val + 1`.\n\nLet's do some algebra. `4(k - 1) <= m_val - 3`. This implies that `m_val - 4(k - 1) >= 3`. In the worst case, the smallest dimension for the `k`-th ring will be at least 3. This means that I never need to worry about one of the dimensions becoming invalid. This is important to note since my formula is only valid if both dimensions are at least 1.\n\nThe plan is to loop from 1 to `k`, calculating the number of gilded cells for each ring using `2 * current_w + 2 * current_h - 4`, and summing these values. I'm confident that this should accurately compute the total number of gilded cells.\n",
