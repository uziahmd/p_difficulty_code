Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, so here's what I'm thinking about this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem:**\n\nRight, I need to write a Python script for this.  It's a competitive programming thing, so the focus is on efficiency and getting the right answer quickly.\n\nI've got the Golorp's \"program\" as a string.  It's made up of variables (0-9), and the goal is to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that makes the Golorp happy. Or return \"false\" if no solution exists.\n\nThe program's structure is pretty clear: it starts with `?(` and has an expression (the \"jaws\"), followed by `):-` and then the conditions (the \"stomach\"), ending with a `.`.\n\nThe \"jaws,\" or the expression, seem to use `_` for variables and basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.  The key here is operator precedence. It's not explicitly stated, but based on the examples and the usual conventions in competitive programming, I'm pretty sure it's standard arithmetic precedence: multiplication and division before addition and subtraction, and left-to-right for operators with the same precedence.  Integer division is implied because variables are integers. The `_` act as placeholders, and the number of them determines which variable value to use in the expression evaluation.\n\nThe \"stomach,\" or the conditions, are a list of comparisons: `>`, `<`, or `=`.  Each comparison involves a sequence of `_` characters.  The number of underscores indicates which variable is being compared against which.\n\nThinking about the example, `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`  becomes `v1 - v2 / v3 * v4` (with standard precedence) and the condition is `v3 > v4`.  The example's output confirms my interpretation.\n\nSo, I need to parse the Golorp's program, evaluate the expression based on the variable values, check if all conditions are met, and find the smallest lexicographically sequence that works. I'll need to figure out an efficient way to generate and test combinations of variable values, probably starting from `0000...` and going up. I'm thinking a depth-first search approach might work nicely, or some kind of backtracking with optimizations.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (0-9) that satisfies a Golorp's \"name\". The name consists of an arithmetic expression and a set of conditions.\n\n**Problem Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Parsing the Name:**\n    *   The name is structured as `?(<expression>):-<conditions>.`\n    *   We need to extract the `expression` and the `conditions`.\n    *   The `expression` contains `_` characters (representing variables) and operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.\n    *   The `conditions` are comma-separated and each condition is of the form `___<___`, `___>___`, or `___=___`. The `_` sequences in conditions refer to variables.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Expression:**\n    *   The `_` characters in the expression are placeholders for input variables. We need to count how many `_` are in the expression to determine `N`, the number of variables required.\n    *   The expression uses standard arithmetic operators. We'll assume standard operator precedence: `*`, `/` before `+`, `-`, and left-to-right for operators of the same precedence. Division `/` should be integer division.\n    *   The result of the expression will be `E`.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Conditions:**\n    *   Each condition compares two values. These values are `v_i` (the i-th input variable) or `E` (the expression result).\n    *   The problem states: \"A sequence of `_` characters represents the value of the expression. The number of `_` characters indicates which variable's value is used.\" This is a crucial and somewhat ambiguous part.\n        *   If it means `_` refers to `v1`, `__` refers to `v2`, etc., then `_` sequences in conditions refer to variables, not the expression result.\n        *   If it means `_` refers to `E`, `__` refers to `E`, etc., then all `_` sequences in conditions refer to `E`.\n        *   The examples clarify this: `___>__` in `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` refers to `v3 > v4`. `___<___,___<____` in `?(...):-__<___,...` refers to `v2 < v3`, `v3 < v4`. This confirms that `_` sequences in conditions refer to *variables* `v1, v2, ...` based on their length. The result `E` is never referenced in the conditions directly by `_` sequences. This simplifies things greatly.\n    *   So, a sequence of `k` underscores in a condition refers to `v_k`.\n    *   All conditions must be true for a given set of variable values.\n\n4.  **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Sequence:**\n    *   We need to find `v1, v2, ..., vN` such that `0 <= v_i <= 9` for all `i`.\n    *   We need to iterate through possible variable values in a way that guarantees finding the lexicographically smallest valid sequence first. This suggests a recursive backtracking approach (depth-first search) or an iterative approach with nested loops.\n    *   Since `N` can be up to 1024 (from string length), a simple `N` nested loop approach is impossible (`10^1024` combinations).\n    *   The maximum length of an `_` sequence in the examples is 7. If `N` is small (e.g., up to 7-8), `10^N` is feasible. However, `_` in expression could be many.\n    *   Let's re-read: \"The input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long)\". A golorp name like `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.` has `N=2+3+4+5+6+7=27` variables in conditions and `N_expr = 22+4+7+2+5+6+3=49` variables in expression. The total number of variables `N` is the count of `_` in the expression. This can be up to `(1024 - len(\"?()+:-.\")) / 2` roughly, which is around 500. This means `N` can be large.\n\n    *   **Crucial Insight for Large N:** If `N` is large, we cannot try all combinations. This implies that many variables' values are *not* constrained by the conditions. Only variables explicitly mentioned in conditions or involved in divisions (where `v_k=0` is problematic) need careful assignment.\n    *   Variables that are *not* mentioned in any condition and are not divisors in the expression can be set to `0` to achieve the lexicographically smallest sequence.\n    *   Variables that *are* mentioned in conditions, or are divisors, need to be assigned values carefully.\n    *   The maximum index of a variable involved in a condition in the examples is 7. In `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` it's `v5`. This suggests `N` might be effectively small, or only a small subset of `v_i` matter.\n    *   Let's assume `N` is the number of `_` in the expression. We need to find `v1, ..., vN`.\n    *   The constraints are on `v_k` where `k` is the length of an `_` sequence in a condition.\n    *   The maximum `k` (length of `_` sequence) in the examples is 7. This implies `v_1` through `v_7` are the only variables possibly constrained by conditions. All other `v_k` for `k > 7` (or whatever the max `k` is) can be `0` to minimize lexicographically, *unless* they are divisors.\n\n**Refined Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Parse:**\n    *   Split the name into `expression_str` and `conditions_str`.\n    *   From `expression_str`, count `N` (number of `_` characters).\n    *   Identify which variables `v_k` are used as divisors in the expression. Store their indices.\n    *   Parse `conditions_str` into a list of tuples `(op_char, var_idx1, var_idx2)`. Collect all `var_idx` mentioned in conditions. Let `max_constrained_var_idx` be the maximum index `k` for which `v_k` is mentioned in any condition.\n\n2.  **Variable Assignment:**\n    *   We need to assign values to `v1, ..., vN`.\n    *   The search space is `v1, ..., v_M` where `M = max(N, max_constrained_var_idx)`. If `N < max_constrained_var_idx`, we still need to assign values up to `v_max_constrained_var_idx` because conditions might refer to variables beyond `N`. This is problematic if `N` is the total number of `_` in the expression. The problem states \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\" This means `N` is the total number of `_` in the expression. If a condition refers to `v_k` where `k > N`, that's an invalid condition or implies `N` should be larger. Example `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` has `N=5` variables in the expression. Conditions are `v2 > v3` and `v5 < v2`. All indices are within `N`. This suggests `max_constrained_var_idx <= N`.\n    *   So, we need to assign `v1, ..., vN`.\n    *   The crucial observation: only variables `v_k` explicitly mentioned in conditions OR used as a divisor in the expression need to be iterated. All other variables can be set to 0.\n    *   Let `relevant_var_indices` be the set of `k` such that `v_k` is mentioned in a condition or `v_k` is a divisor.\n    *   Let `K = len(relevant_var_indices)`. We will iterate over `10^K` combinations for these relevant variables. This `K` should be small enough. In the examples, `K` seems to be at most 7.\n    *   We will use a recursive backtracking function `solve(current_var_idx, current_assignment)`:\n        *   Base Case: If `current_var_idx > N`, we have a full assignment.\n            *   Evaluate the expression with `current_assignment`. If any division by zero occurs, this assignment is invalid.\n            *   Check all conditions. If all are true, we found a valid solution. Since we iterate lexicographically, this is the smallest. Return `current_assignment`.\n        *   Recursive Step:\n            *   If `current_var_idx` is in `relevant_var_indices`:\n                *   Loop `val` from 0 to 9.\n                *   `current_assignment[current_var_idx-1] = val`\n                *   Call `solve(current_var_idx + 1, current_assignment)`. If it returns a solution, propagate it.\n            *   Else (`current_var_idx` is not relevant):\n                *   `current_assignment[current_var_idx-1] = 0` (lexicographically smallest choice)\n                *   Call `solve(current_var_idx + 1, current_assignment)`. If it returns a solution, propagate it.\n        *   If no value for `current_var_idx` leads to a solution, return `None`.\n\n**Detailed Implementation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Parsing `expression_str`:**\n    *   Iterate through `expression_str`.\n    *   Keep track of `_` count for `N`.\n    *   To identify divisors:\n        *   We need to parse the expression into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or use a Shunting-yard algorithm to get Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).\n        *   A simpler approach for this problem: Identify `_` that are immediately after a `/` or are part of a subexpression that is the right operand of a `/`. This is tricky without full parsing.\n        *   Given the constraints and typical competitive programming problem styles, it's more likely that the maximum index `k` for which `v_k` is a divisor is also small. We can just list all `_` that are to the right of a `/` in the `expression_str` as potential divisors.\n        *   Example: `_-_/___*__` -> `v1 - v2 / v3 * v4`. Here `v3` is a divisor.\n        *   `__+___+__-___` -> `v2 + v3 + v2 - v3`. No divisions.\n        *   Let's refine divisor identification: any `_` sequence that is the right operand of a `/` operator.\n            *   Scan the expression. If we see a `/`, the next `_` sequence is a divisor.\n            *   This is not entirely accurate for complex expressions like `A / (B * C)`. `B` and `C` are not direct right operands of `/`. But the problem examples suggest simple expressions. Let's assume `_` immediately after `/` is the divisor.\n            *   The safest way: during expression evaluation, when `A / B` is computed, mark `B`'s constituent variables as divisors.\n\n2.  **Parsing `conditions_str`:**\n    *   Split by `,`.\n    *   For each condition `s`:\n        *   Find `op_char` (`<`, `>`, `=`).\n        *   Extract `_` counts for left and right operands. E.g., `___` means `var_idx = 3`.\n        *   Add these `var_idx` to `relevant_var_indices`.\n\n3.  **Expression Evaluation Function `eval_expr(values, expression_str)`:**\n    *   This function needs to parse and evaluate the arithmetic expression given the `values` array `[v1, v2, ..., vN]`.\n    *   It should also detect division by zero.\n    *   A simple way for expressions without parentheses:\n        *   Tokenize the expression: `_`, `__`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.\n        *   Convert `_` sequences to their corresponding `values[idx-1]`.\n        *   Apply operator precedence:\n            *   First pass: process all `*` and `/` from left to right.\n            *   Second pass: process all `+` and `-` from left to right.\n        *   Keep track of variables used as divisors.\n\n    *   **Revised `eval_expr` (using Shunting-yard and RPN):**\n        *   Convert `expression_str` to tokens: `v_k` (for `k` underscores), `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.\n        *   Use Shunting-yard to convert infix tokens to RPN.\n        *   Evaluate RPN using a stack. During evaluation:\n            *   When `op_val1 / op_val2` is performed, if `op_val2 == 0`, return `(None, True)` (value, division_by_zero_flag).\n            *   Keep track of which `v_k` form `op_val2`. For this, stack elements should store not just values but also the set of `v_k` indices that contributed to that value. This is getting complex.\n\n    *   **Simpler `eval_expr` for this problem's likely scope:**\n        *   The problem statement says \"All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples.\"\n        *   Sample expressions: `_-_/___*__`, `__-_+_/_____`, `______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___`, `__+___+__-___`.\n        *   They are all flat, without parentheses. This makes evaluation much simpler.\n        *   Tokenize into numbers (from `values` array) and operators.\n        *   Example: `v1 - v2 / v3 * v4`\n        *   List of numbers/operators: `[v1, '-', v2, '/', v3, '*', v4]`\n        *   First pass (high precedence `*`, `/`):\n            *   Find `/`: `v2 / v3`. `temp = v2 // v3`. If `v3 == 0`, mark div by zero. Replace `v2, '/', v3` with `temp`. Divisors: `v3`.\n            *   List becomes `[v1, '-', temp, '*', v4]`\n            *   Find `*`: `temp * v4`. `temp2 = temp * v4`. Replace `temp, '*', v4` with `temp2`.\n            *   List becomes `[v1, '-', temp2]`\n        *   Second pass (low precedence `+`, `-`):\n            *   `v1 - temp2`. Result.\n        *   This approach correctly identifies `v3` as a divisor.\n\n**Revised `eval_expr(values, expression_str, N)`:**\n\n1.  `tokens = []`\n2.  `i = 0`\n3.  `var_idx_counter = 0`\n4.  `divisors_encountered = set()`\n5.  While `i < len(expression_str)`:\n    *   If `expression_str[i] == '_':`\n        *   `var_idx_counter += 1`\n        *   `tokens.append((values[var_idx_counter - 1], var_idx_counter))` (store value and original var index)\n        *   `i += 1`\n    *   Else (operator):\n        *   `tokens.append(expression_str[i])`\n        *   `i += 1`\n5.  `current_tokens = list(tokens)`\n6.  `op_precedence = {'*': 2, '/': 2, '+': 1, '-': 1}`\n\n7.  **Pass 1: `*`, `/`**\n    *   `new_tokens = []`\n    *   `idx = 0`\n    *   While `idx < len(current_tokens)`:\n        *   If `current_tokens[idx]` is an operator `*` or `/`:\n            *   `op = current_tokens[idx]`\n            *   `left_val, _ = new_tokens.pop()`\n            *   `right_val, right_var_idx = current_tokens[idx+1]`\n            *   If `op == '/'`:\n                *   If `right_val == 0`: return `(None, True)` (division by zero)\n                *   `res = left_val // right_val`\n                *   `divisors_encountered.add(right_var_idx)`\n            *   Else (`op == '*'`)\n                *   `res = left_val * right_val`\n            *   `new_tokens.append((res, None))` (intermediate results don't have a single var_idx)\n            *   `idx += 2`\n        *   Else:\n            *   `new_tokens.append(current_tokens[idx])`\n            *   `idx += 1`\n    *   `current_tokens = new_tokens`\n\n8.  **Pass 2: `+`, `-`**\n    *   `result = current_tokens[0][0]`\n    *   `idx = 1`\n    *   While `idx < len(current_tokens)`:\n        *   `op = current_tokens[idx]`\n        *   `val, _ = current_tokens[idx+1]`\n        *   If `op == '+': result += val`\n        *   Else (`op == '-'`): `result -= val`\n        *   `idx += 2`\n    *   Return `(result, False, divisors_encountered)`\n\n**Main Logic (Backtracking):**\n\n1.  Parse `expression_str` to get `N` (total variables).\n2.  Parse `conditions_str` to get `conditions` list `[(op_char, var_idx1, var_idx2)]` and collect all `var_idx` into `constrained_var_indices`.\n3.  Initialize `all_var_values = [0] * N`.\n4.  Initialize `best_solution = None`.\n\n5.  Define `solve(k)`: (where `k` is the current variable index being assigned, 0-indexed)\n    *   `nonlocal best_solution`\n    *   If `best_solution` is already found (and we want the smallest), we can stop.\n    *   If `k == N`: (All variables assigned)\n        *   `expr_result, div_by_zero, divisors = eval_expr(all_var_values, expression_str, N)`\n        *   If `div_by_zero`: return\n        *   For each condition `(op, idx1, idx2)`:\n            *   `val1 = all_var_values[idx1-1]`\n            *   `val2 = all_var_values[idx2-1]`\n            *   If `op == '<'` and `val1 >= val2`: return\n            *   If `op == '>''` and `val1 <= val2`: return\n            *   If `op == '='` and `val1 != val2`: return\n        *   `best_solution = \"\".join(map(str, all_var_values))`\n        *   Return (found solution)\n\n    *   `is_constrained = (k + 1 in constrained_var_indices) or (k + 1 in divisors)` (divisors from a previous `eval_expr` call are not accurate for current assignment)\n    *   **Revised:** The set of divisors is dynamic and depends on the values. We can't pre-calculate `divisors` for `relevant_var_indices`. We must run `eval_expr` at the base case `k == N` to get the actual divisors and check `div_by_zero`.\n    *   So, `relevant_var_indices` only includes `var_idx` from conditions.\n\n    *   If `k + 1` in `constrained_var_indices`:\n        *   For `val` from 0 to 9:\n            *   `all_var_values[k] = val`\n            *   `solve(k + 1)`\n            *   If `best_solution` is not `None`, return\n    *   Else (`k + 1` is not in `constrained_var_indices`):\n        *   `all_var_values[k] = 0` (lexicographically smallest)\n        *   `solve(k + 1)`\n        *   If `best_solution` is not `None`, return\n\n6.  Call `solve(0)`.\n7.  Output `best_solution` or `\"false\"`.\n\n**Maximum `N` and `constrained_var_indices`:**\n*   The maximum `N` (number of `_` in expression) can be large.\n*   The maximum index in conditions `v_k` from examples is 7. Let's assume `max_constrained_var_idx` is small (e.g., up to 10-15).\n*   If `N` is large, but `max_constrained_var_idx` is small, then we only need to iterate `v_1` to `v_max_constrained_var_idx`. For `v_k` where `k > max_constrained_var_idx`, we set them to `0`. This means `solve(k)` only needs to iterate up to `k = max_constrained_var_idx`.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input:**\n    *   Extract `expression_str` and `conditions_str`.\n    *   Count `N`: number of `_` in `expression_str`.\n    *   Parse `conditions_str`:\n        *   `conditions = []`\n        *   `constrained_var_indices = set()`\n        *   For each condition string:\n            *   Identify operator (`<`, `>`, `=`).\n            *   Count `_` for left operand (`idx1`).\n            *   Count `_` for right operand (`idx2`).\n            *   Add `(operator, idx1, idx2)` to `conditions`.\n            *   Add `idx1` and `idx2` to `constrained_var_indices`.\n    *   `max_relevant_idx = N` (We must assign all `N` variables).\n\n2.  **Backtracking Search:**\n    *   `current_assignment = [0] * N` (Initialize with zeros)\n    *   `found_solution = None`\n\n    *   `solve(k)`: (recursive function, `k` is the 0-indexed variable being assigned `v_{k+1}`)\n        *   `nonlocal found_solution`\n        *   If `found_solution` is not `None`: return (already found the lexicographically smallest)\n        *   If `k == N`: (All `N` variables assigned)\n            *   `expr_val, div_by_zero = evaluate_expression(expression_str, current_assignment)`\n            *   If `div_by_zero`: return\n            *   If `expr_val` is `None`: return (some other error, though `div_by_zero` covers main one)\n            *   For `op, idx1, idx2` in `conditions`:\n                *   `val1 = current_assignment[idx1 - 1]`\n                *   `val2 = current_assignment[idx2 - 1]`\n                *   If `op == '<'` and `val1 >= val2`: return\n                *   If `op == '>'` and `val1 <= val2`: return\n                *   If `op == '='` and `val1 != val2`: return\n            *   `found_solution = \"\".join(map(str, current_assignment))`\n            *   Return\n\n        *   `var_is_constrained = (k + 1 in constrained_var_indices)`\n        *   If `var_is_constrained`:\n            *   For `val` from 0 to 9:\n                *   `current_assignment[k] = val`\n                *   `solve(k + 1)`\n                *   If `found_solution` is not `None`: return\n        *   Else: (Variable `v_{k+1}` is not explicitly constrained by conditions)\n            *   `current_assignment[k] = 0` (Set to 0 for lexicographical smallest)\n            *   `solve(k + 1)`\n            *   If `found_solution` is not `None`: return\n\n3.  **`evaluate_expression(expr_str, values)` function:**\n    *   Tokenize `expr_str` into `(value, var_idx)` tuples for variables and operator strings.\n    *   Example: `_-_/___*__` with `values = [v1, v2, v3, v4]`\n        *   Tokens: `[(v1,1), '-', (v2,2), '/', (v3,3), '*', (v4,4)]`\n    *   **Pass 1 (Multiplication/Division):**\n        *   Create `temp_tokens` list.\n        *   Iterate through `tokens`. If `*` or `/` found:\n            *   Pop `left_operand` from `temp_tokens`.\n            *   Get `right_operand` from `tokens` list.\n            *   Perform operation.

Not possible, min length 13.\n*   Expression with only `_`? e.g., `?(____):-___>__.` `N=4`. `eval_expr` will return `v4` as result.\n*   Conditions referring to `v_k` where `k > N`? The problem implies `k <= N`. If it happens, `current_assignment[idx-1]` would be out of bounds. The problem statement guarantees valid name.\n*   Integer overflow for expression result? Values are 0-9. `9*9*9*...` can be large. Max `N` is about 500. `9^500` is huge. But intermediate results are `val * val`. `9*9=81`. `81*9=729`. `729*9=6561`. `6561*9=59049`. `59049*9=531441`. Python handles large integers automatically.\n*   Performance of `eval_expr`: It's `O(N_expr)` where `N_expr` is the length of the expression string. This is called `10^K` times where `K` is `len(constrained_var_indices)`. If `K` is small (e.g., 7), `10^7 * N_expr` is feasible. `10^7 * 1024` is `10^10`, too slow.\n*   Wait, `N_expr` is the number of `_` characters in the expression, not the length of the string. The actual length of expression string can be up to 1024. `N_expr` is at most 500. `10^7 * 500` is `5 * 10^9`, still too slow.\n*   The `eval_expr` is `O(L)` where `L` is the number of tokens in the expression. `L` is proportional to `N_expr`.\n\n**The `eval_expr` performance is critical.**\nThe issue is that `N` can be up to 500. `solve(k)` iterates `k` from `0` to `N-1`. Even if `constrained_var_indices` is small, the `solve(k)` call for `k` not in `constrained_var_indices` still recurses `N - K` times.\nExample: `N=500`, `K=7`.\n`solve(0)` -> `solve(1)` -> ... -> `solve(6)` (iterating 10 values each) -> `solve(7)` (set to 0) -> `solve(8)` (set to 0) -> ... -> `solve(499)` (set to 0) -> `solve(500)`.\nThe base case `solve(500)` will be called `10^K` times. Each call to `solve(500)` calls `eval_expr`.\nSo, total time complexity is `10^K * O(N_expr)`.\nIf `K=7`, `10^7 * 500 = 5 * 10^9`. This is too slow for typical competitive programming limits (usually `10^8` operations).\n\n**Re-evaluating the `N` constraint:**\n\"The input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long)\".\n\"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\nThe number of variables `N` is the count of `_` in the expression.\nExample 3: `?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.`\nExpression: `______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___`\n`22 + 4 + 7 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 3 = 49` underscores. So `N=49`.\nConditions: `v2<v3, v3<v4, v4<v5, v5<v6, v6<v7`.\n`constrained_var_indices = {2,3,4,5,6,7}`. So `K=6`.\n`10^6 * N_expr` is `10^6 * 49` which is `4.9 * 10^7`. This is perfectly acceptable!\n\nThis means the assumption that `K` (number of constrained variables) is small is correct. The maximum `N` (total variables) can be up to `~500`, but only a small subset of these are constrained by conditions.\n\nThe `eval_expr` function should be correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    name = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # 1.
