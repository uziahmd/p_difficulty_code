She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Okay, so here's the deal.** I've been tasked with finding the most efficient way to solve this \"Browser\" programming problem, and my current thinking is pretty organized, if I do say so myself. The gist is, you've got this set of tabs, you need to keep a certain range, and close everything else as quickly as possible. Time is the key here.\n\nFirst off, I've defined the key players: `n` is the total tabs, `pos` is where the cursor currently sits, and `l` and `r` are the boundaries you need to *keep* open. The moves include going left or right, each one second.  Plus closing tabs to the left, which also takes a second, or the right - a second. The goal is to minimize this time.\n\nMy thought process broke down the scenarios into these cases:\n\n*   **Case 1:** All tabs are within the safe zone (`l` is 1 and `r` is `n`). Zero time. Done.\n*   **Case 2:** Tabs to the left of `l` need closing (`r` is `n`). Move to `l`, then close them. Time is the distance to `l` + 1.\n*   **Case 3:** Tabs to the right of `r` need closing (`l` is 1). Move to `r`, close them. Time is the distance to `r` + 1.\n*   **Case 4:** Tabs on both sides need closing (`l` is greater than 1, and `r` is less than `n`). This one's the real meat of the problem. It's at least two seconds (one to close each side). There are two routes - close the left first, then the right, OR the reverse. The time here is more complicated, the movement between left and right is the distance between them. The initial movement from the current position can go to either, so I need to choose the best starting point. The overall formula is going to be `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nI really have to make sure the math is correct and these different `a` and `b` indexes are all handled correctly as the tabs close in each of these scenarios. I have to stay within the bounds of what the problem allows. The key is correctly handling which tabs are \"open\" or \"closed\".  I've checked different situations and made sure the formula works. I have some sample cases too, just to be safe. It looks like my logic is solid, and I've got this all worked out, including how the movements need to happen.  The code is ready to go, I think.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside a specified range `[l, r]`. We are given the total number of tabs `n`, the initial cursor position `pos`, and the desired range `[l, r]`. Each move or close operation takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the different scenarios:\n\n1.  **All tabs are within the desired range `[l, r]`**:\n    This happens when `l = 1` and `r = n`. In this case, no tabs need to be closed.\n    The minimum time is `0`.\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed**:\n    This happens when `l > 1` and `r = n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`.\n    To do this, the cursor must move to tab `l` (or any tab to its right, but `l` is the most efficient target if `pos` is to its left, or simply staying at `pos` if `pos` is to its right of `l`), and then perform a \"close left\" operation.\n    The time taken will be:\n    *   `abs(pos - l)`: Time to move the cursor from `pos` to `l`.\n    *   `+ 1`: Time to close all tabs to the left of `l`.\n    Total time: `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed**:\n    This happens when `l = 1` and `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`.\n    Similar to the previous case, the cursor must move to tab `r` (or any tab to its left), and then perform a \"close right\" operation.\n    The time taken will be:\n    *   `abs(pos - r)`: Time to move the cursor from `pos` to `r`.\n    *   `+ 1`: Time to close all tabs to the right of `r`.\n    Total time: `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Tabs on both sides need to be closed**:\n    This happens when `l > 1` and `r < n`. We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` AND `[r+1, n]`.\n    This scenario requires two \"close\" operations (one for the left side, one for the right side), which will take 2 seconds.\n    Additionally, the cursor needs to move to `l` (or past it) to perform the left-side closing, and to `r` (or past it) to perform the right-side closing.\n    Essentially, the cursor must traverse the path from its initial `pos` to `l` and then to `r`, or from `pos` to `r` and then to `l`. The order matters for the initial movement, but the movement between `l` and `r` will always be `r - l` seconds.\n\n    Let's consider two strategies:\n    *   **Strategy A: Close left first, then right.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. Cost: `abs(pos - l)`.\n        2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n        3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`. Cost: `(r - l)` (since `l <= r`).\n        4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n        Total cost for Strategy A: `abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\n    *   **Strategy B: Close right first, then left.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. Cost: `abs(pos - r)`.\n        2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `b` becomes `r`).\n        3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`. Cost: `(r - l)`.\n        4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`. Cost: `1`. (Now `a` becomes `l`).\n        Total cost for Strategy B: `abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\n    The minimum time for this case is the minimum of Strategy A and Strategy B:\n    `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`.\n\nThe solution combines these cases using `if-elif-else` statements.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, pos, l, r from standard input\n    # n: total number of tabs (1 to n)\n    # pos: current cursor position\n    # l: left boundary of the segment of tabs to keep\n    # r: right boundary of the segment of tabs to keep\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Case 1: The segment [l, r] covers all tabs [1, n].\n    # No tabs need to be closed.\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the right of r need to be closed.\n    # This implies l is 1 (since it's not Case 1) and r < n.\n    # The cursor needs to move to r, then close tabs [r+1, n].\n    if l == 1:\n        # Cost = (time to move from pos to r) + (time to close right)\n        cost = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        print(cost)\n        return\n\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the left of l need to be closed.\n    # This implies r is n (since it's not Case 1) and l > 1.\n    # The cursor needs to move to l, then close tabs [1, l-1].\n    if r == n:\n        # Cost = (time to move from pos to l) + (time to close left)\n        cost = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        print(cost)\n        return\n\n    # Case 4: Tabs on both sides need to be closed.\n    # This implies l > 1 and r < n.\n    # We need to perform two close operations (costing 2 seconds).\n    # The cursor must visit both l and r.
