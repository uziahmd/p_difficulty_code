Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Decoding the Morse Code Puzzle**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I need a Python script to tackle this Morse code problem. Let's break it down methodically.\n\nFirst, I see that dots are '0' and dashes are '1'. That's straightforward. The trick is that each English letter is encoded with a Morse code string of length 1 to 4. Considering all combinations, there are 30 possible strings of lengths 1-4. But, four of these strings are invalid, leaving us with exactly 26 valid codes that correspond to our English alphabet.\n\nNow, the core task is this: As I add a dot or dash to the string `S` (initially empty), I need to count the number of *non-empty* sequences of English letters that are formed by *any substring* within `S`. This count has to be returned modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nLet me clarify what they mean by \"sequences of English letters\". If \"1\" is 'T', \"11\" is 'M', and \"111\" is 'O', then for `S = \"111\"`, substrings are \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\". That means valid letter sequences are 'T', 'M', and 'O'.\n\nIf we have `S = \"101\"` and assume some basic mappings, like \"1\" to A, \"0\" to B, \"10\" to C, \"01\" to D, and \"101\" to E, the problem's really about recognizing all possible combinations of these letters that can be constructed from substrings.  It's clear that it isn't only prefix strings. For `S = \"101\"` all substrings must be considered: \"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"10\", \"01\", \"101\".  Any combination of these is a sequence.\n\nMy initial thought was dynamic programming, maybe using `dp[i]` to represent the number of letter sequences for prefixes ending at `i`. But, that doesn't quite capture the \"some substring\" condition. It needs to be more flexible, accounting for substrings that *end* at an index, *start* at an index, or *span* across the string. \n\nI think I need to define `S_k` as the string `S` after `k` characters are appended. For each `S_k`, I'll need to calculate the total number of distinct sequences. \n\nThe main challenge is how to efficiently identify all valid letter sequences within each substring `S[i...j]`. If the length of `S[i...j]` is between 1-4 and it is valid, it represents a single letter. But how do I account for the other sequences, like `C1 C2 ... C_p`, a sequence of letters formed by combining smaller substrings? This seems like a dynamic programming approach, iterating through all substrings, but I'll need a way to combine the counts. Let me think on this some more.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by segmenting *any substring* of the current Morse code string `S`. The string `S` grows by appending one character ('0' or '1') at a time. We need to report the total count modulo $10^9 + 7$ after each append.\n\nA Morse code for an English letter has a length between 1 and 4. There are $2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30$ such strings. Four of these are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". This means $30 - 4 = 26$ strings correspond to distinct English letters.\n\nLet `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\nLet `S` be the current Morse code string. Its length will be `k` after `k` appends.\nWe need to count sequences from *all* substrings of `S`.\n\nLet's define a function `count_sequences(text)` that calculates the number of non-empty sequences of English letters represented by `text`.\nThis is a standard dynamic programming problem.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to segment the prefix `text[0...i-1]` into valid Morse codes.\n`dp[0] = 1` (empty prefix has one way to be segmented, representing an empty sequence).\nFor `i` from 1 to `len(text)`:\n  `dp[i] = 0`\n  For `j` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i - j >= 0`:\n      Let `sub = text[i-j ... i-1]`.\n      If `sub` is a valid Morse code for an English letter:\n        `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i-j]) % MOD`\n\nThe total number of non-empty sequences for `text` is `(dp[len(text)] - 1 + MOD) % MOD` (subtract 1 for the empty sequence).\n\nWhen a new character is appended to `S`, say `S_new = S + char`, we need to update the total count.\nThe new substrings introduced are those ending at the new character `char` (which is at index `k` in `S_new`). These are `S_new[0...k]`, `S_new[1...k]`, ..., `S_new[k...k]`.\nFor each starting position `i` from `0` to `k`, the substring `S_new[i...k]` is `S[i...k-1] + char`.\nWe need to calculate `count_sequences(S_new[i...k])` for all `i` and add them to the total.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to maintain a DP state for each *suffix* of `S`.\nLet `f[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed from the suffix `S[i...k-1]` (where `k` is the current length of `S`).\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, `S` becomes `S + c`. Let its new length be `k`.\nThe new suffixes are `S[0...k-1]`, `S[1...k-1]`, ..., `S[k-1...k-1]`.\nThe values `f[i]` for `i < k-1` are not directly `f[i]` from the previous step. They refer to `S[i...k-1]`.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to segment the suffix `S[i...k-1]` into valid Morse codes.\nWhen `S` grows to length `k`:\n`dp[k] = 1` (representing an empty sequence after index `k-1`).\nFor `i` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[i] = 0`\n  For `j` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i + j <= k`:\n      Let `sub = S[i ... i+j-1]`.\n      If `sub` is a valid Morse code:\n        `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i+j]) % MOD`\n\nThe number of non-empty sequences from `S[i...k-1]` is `(dp[i] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`.\nThe total answer for `S` of length `k` is the sum of `(dp[i] - 1 + MOD) % MOD` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.\n\nThis approach still recalculates `dp[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1` at each step.\nSince `m` can be up to 3000, and `k` up to `m`, this would be $O(m^2 \\times 4)$, which is $3000^2 \\times 4 \\approx 3.6 \\times 10^7$, potentially too slow for Python. We need something faster.\n\nLet's define `dp_val[i]` as the number of ways to segment `S[i...k-1]` into valid Morse codes.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S_old + c`. Let `k` be the new length.\nThe `dp_val` values change.\n`dp_val[k] = 1` (base case for empty suffix).\nFor `i` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n  `current_char = S[i]`\n  `dp_val[i] = 0`\n  For `j` from 1 to 4:\n    If `i + j <= k`:\n      `sub = S[i ... i+j-1]`\n      If `sub` is valid:\n        `dp_val[i] = (dp_val[i] + dp_val[i+j]) % MOD`\n\nThe total answer for `S` of length `k` is `sum( (dp_val[i] - 1 + MOD) % MOD for i in range(k) ) % MOD`.\n\nThe `dp_val[i]` calculation for a fixed `i` depends on `dp_val[i+1]`, `dp_val[i+2]`, `dp_val[i+3]`, `dp_val[i+4]`.\nWhen `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S_old + c`.\nThe `dp_val` array will be of size `k+1`.\n`dp_val[k]` is 1.\n`dp_val[k-1]` depends on `S[k-1]` and `dp_val[k]`.\n`dp_val[k-2]` depends on `S[k-2]`, `S[k-2...k-1]` and `dp_val[k-1]`, `dp_val[k]`.\n...\n`dp_val[0]` depends on `S[0]`, `S[0...1]`, `S[0...2]`, `S[0...3]` and `dp_val[1]`, `dp_val[2]`, `dp_val[3]`, `dp_val[4]`.\n\nThe key observation is that when `S` grows from length `k-1` to `k` by appending `c`, the values `dp_val[i]` for `i < k-1` *change*. This is because `S[i...k-1]` is now `S_old[i...k-2] + c`.\nWe need to compute `dp_val[i]` for `i = k-1, k-2, ..., 0` at each step.\nThe computation for each `dp_val[i]` takes $O(1)$ time (summing up to 4 terms).\nThere are `k` such `dp_val[i]` values to compute.\nSo, for each append operation, it takes $O(k)$ time.\nTotal time complexity: $O(1 + 2 + ... + m) = O(m^2)$.\nFor $m=3000$, $m^2 = 9 \\times 10^6$. This should be acceptable for Python.\n\nLet's list the valid Morse codes and the invalid ones for quick lookup.\nValid codes (length 1-4):\n\"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\", \"000\", \"001\", \"010\", \"100\", \"101\", \"110\", \"0000\", \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\", \"0110\", \"0111\", \"1000\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1011\", \"1100\", \"1101\", \"1110\" (Wait, \"1110\" is invalid according to problem description. Let me re-check the problem statement carefully)\n\n\"In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\"\n\nSo, the set of *invalid* codes are: `{\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\nAny other string of length 1 to 4 is a *valid* Morse code.\nLet `IS_VALID` be a helper function/set for this.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n    # Store the current Morse code string\n    S = [] \n    \n    # Set of invalid Morse codes\n    INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    # dp_val[i] will store the number of ways to segment the suffix S[i...k-1]\n    # into valid Morse codes. dp_val[k] is 1 (base case for empty suffix).\n    # The actual values of dp_val will change with each append.\n    # We will recompute it for the current S.\n    dp_val = [0] * (m + 1) # Max length of S is m, so indices 0 to m.\n                           # dp_val[k] will be used for S of length k.\n                           \n    current_total_sequences = 0\n    \n    for k_minus_1 in range(m): # k_minus_1 is the 0-indexed position of the new char\n        char = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S.append(char)\n        k = k_minus_1 + 1 # k is the current length of S (1-indexed)\n        \n        # Initialize dp_val[k] for the empty suffix S[k...k-1]\n        dp_val[k] = 1\n        \n        # Calculate dp_val[i] for i from k-1 down to 0\n        for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):\n            dp_val[i] = 0\n            current_suffix_str = \"\"\n            # Check substrings of length 1 to 4 starting at i\n            for j in range(1, 5): # j is length of substring\n                if i + j <= k: # Check if substring is within bounds\n                    current_suffix_str = \"\".join(S[i : i+j])\n                    \n                    # Check if current_suffix_str is a valid Morse code\n                    # (length 1-4 and not in INVALID_CODES)\n                    if current_suffix_str not in INVALID_CODES:\n                        dp_val[i] = (dp_val[i] + dp_val[i+j]) % MOD\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of non-empty sequences\n        # This is the sum of (dp_val[i] - 1) for all i from 0 to k-1\n        # (dp_val[i] includes the empty sequence, so subtract 1)\n        current_total_sequences = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            current_total_sequences = (current_total_sequences + dp_val[i] - 1 + MOD) % MOD\n            \n        sys.stdout.write(str(current_total_sequences) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
