            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\" problem step-by-step. My goal here is to write a Python script that efficiently determines the minimum number of tile draws needed to form at least one \"mentsu\" (koutsu or shuntsu) from a given initial hand of three tiles. I'll represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)` and keep the suit as 'm', 'p', or 's'.**\n\nFirst, I need to define what makes a \"mentsu\": a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three consecutive numbered tiles of the same suit).  Order doesn't matter, so `[5s, 6s, 7s]` is just as valid as `[7s, 5s, 6s]`.\n\nThe key insight is that we need to minimize draws. I will check for the possibility of forming a \"mentsu\" with 0 draws, then 1 draw, and finally 2 draws. With 2 draws, we have 5 tiles and it is always possible to make a \"mentsu\". The maximum number of draws is, therefore, 2.\n\n**Step 0:  Zero Draws Check.** I begin by examining if the initial three tiles (`t1, t2, t3`) can form a \"mentsu\". For a koutsu, all three tiles must be identical (`t1 == t2 == t3`). For a shuntsu, all tiles must be of the same suit, and their numbers must be sequential. I can sort the numbers of the tiles to check for this. If either condition is met, I immediately output \"0\" and stop.\n\n**Step 1: One Draw Check.** If the initial hand doesn't work, I consider drawing one additional tile. I'll create the set of four tiles by drawing any possible tile (a tile is formed from a number and a suit so I have 9 numbers x 3 suits which is 27 possibilities) and then checking all possible combinations of three out of these four tiles (`t1, t2, t3, t_draw`). For each combination, I'll use the koutsu and shuntsu rules to see if I can form a \"mentsu\". If I find a valid \"mentsu\", I output \"1\" and stop.\n**Efficiency Note**: An optimization will involve examining what tiles I *need* instead of iterating every possible drawn tile.\n\n**Step 2: Two Draws Check.** If neither 0 nor 1 draw yields a \"mentsu\", I know I need to draw two tiles, making a hand of five. In this case, I will always be able to form a \"mentsu\", since drawing two identical tiles creates a koutsu. So, if I reach this point, the output is simply \"2\".\n\nI'll use a `is_mentsu()` function that encapsulates the koutsu and shuntsu checks. The function will take a list of three tiles and return `True` or `False`. I'll also have a tile parsing function to convert string inputs like `\"1s\"` into my `(number, suit)` tuple format.\n\nI'll start with the \"0 draws\" check, then progress to the \"1 draw\" check, and finally the \"2 draws\" scenario.  For the \"1 draw\" case, I can check all 27 possible tiles to be drawn. For each drawn tile, I will check if any of the three combinations make up a valid \"mentsu\".\n\nI will carefully test the code with example inputs, including cases where a \"mentsu\" is possible with zero draws, one draw and cases where two draws are needed. The focus will be on correctness, then efficiency, and finally the edge cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) in her hand. She starts with three tiles. She can draw any tiles, including duplicates of tiles she already has.\n\nLet's define the terms:\n*   A **tile** is represented by a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s). We can represent it as a tuple `(number, suit)`.\n*   A **koutsu (triplet)** is three identical tiles, e.g., `[1m, 1m, 1m]`.\n*   A **shuntsu (sequence)** is three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit, e.g., `[1m, 2m, 3m]` or `[5s, 6s, 7s]`. The order of tiles does not matter.\n*   A **mentsu** is either a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\nThe minimum number of draws can be 0, 1, or 2. We can determine this by checking in increasing order of draws:\n\n1.  **Check for 0 draws:**\n    With 0 draws, Tokitsukaze only has her initial three tiles. We need to check if these three tiles already form a mentsu.\n    *   **Koutsu check:** Are all three tiles identical?\n    *   **Shuntsu check:** Are all three tiles of the same suit, and their numbers are sequential (e.g., `n, n+1, n+2`)? (The order of numbers doesn't matter, we can sort them first).\n    If either condition is true, the answer is 0.\n\n2.  **Check for 1 draw:**\n    If 0 draws is not enough, we consider drawing one tile. Tokitsukaze will then have four tiles. We need to check if *any* three of these four tiles can form a mentsu.\n    To do this, we can iterate through all 27 possible tiles she could draw (9 numbers * 3 suits). For each possible drawn tile:\n    *   Add the drawn tile to her initial three tiles, forming a hand of four tiles.\n    *   From these four tiles, there are `C(4, 3) = 4` ways to choose three tiles. Check each of these four combinations using the `is_mentsu` logic from step 1.\n    If any of these combinations forms a mentsu for any drawn tile, the answer is 1.\n\n3.  **Check for 2 draws:**\n    If neither 0 draws nor 1 draw is sufficient, then 2 draws will always be enough. For example, if Tokitsukaze has tile `T1`, she can draw two more `T1` tiles. Her hand would then contain `[T1, T1, T1]` (a koutsu). Thus, the maximum number of draws needed is 2. If we reach this step, the answer is 2.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Tiles are parsed from strings like \"1s\" into `(number, suit)` tuples, e.g., `(1, 's')`.\n*   A helper function `is_mentsu(tiles_list)` will take a list of 3 tile tuples and return `True` if they form a mentsu, `False` otherwise.\n\nThe number of operations is small:\n*   Parsing 3 tiles.\n*   One call to `is_mentsu` for 0 draws.\n*   27 iterations for 1 draw, each involving 4 calls to `is_mentsu`. In total, about 108 calls to `is_mentsu`.\nEach `is_mentsu` call involves a few comparisons and sorting 3 numbers, which is very fast. This approach is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    \"\"\"Parses a tile string (e.g., '1s') into a (number, suit) tuple.\"\"\"\n    num = int(s[0])\n    suit = s[1]\n    return (num, suit)\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a list of 3 tiles forms a mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu).\n    tiles: A list of 3 (number, suit) tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(tiles) != 3:\n        return False\n\n    # Check for Koutsu (three identical tiles)\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return True\n\n    # Check for Shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit)\n    # All must be of the same suit\n    if not (tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]):\n        return False\n\n    # If same suit, check if numbers are sequential\n    nums = sorted([tiles[0][0], tiles[1][0], tiles[2][0]])\n    if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    s_tiles = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    initial_tiles = [parse_tile(s) for s in s_tiles]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Check for 0 draws ---\n    if is_mentsu(initial_tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # --- Step 2: Check for 1 draw ---\n    # Generate all possible tiles that can be drawn\n    all_possible_tiles = []\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            all_possible_tiles.append((num, suit))\n\n    for drawn_tile in all_possible_tiles:\n        current_hand = initial_tiles + [drawn_tile] # Hand now has 4 tiles\n\n        # Check all C(4, 3) = 4 combinations of 3 tiles from the current hand\n        # The combinations are:\n        # (initial_tiles[0], initial_tiles[1], initial_tiles[2]) - already checked\n        # (initial_tiles[0], initial_tiles[1], drawn_tile)\n        # (initial_tiles[0], initial_tiles[2], drawn_tile)\n        # (initial_tiles[1], initial_tiles[2], drawn_tile)\n        # We can simply list them by index:\n        \n        # Check combination (0, 1, 2)\n        if is_mentsu([current_hand[0], current_hand[1], current_hand[2]]):\n            print(1)\n            return\n        # Check combination (0, 1, 3)\n        if is_mentsu([current_hand[0], current_hand[1], current_hand[3]]):\n            print(1)\n            return\n        # Check combination (0, 2, 3)\n        if is_mentsu([current_hand[0], current_hand[2], current_hand[3]]):\n            print(1)\n            return\n        # Check combination (1, 2, 3)\n        if is_mentsu([current_hand[1], current_hand[2], current_hand[3]]):\n            print(1)\n            return\n            \n    # --- Step 3: If 0 or 1 draw is not sufficient, 2 draws are always enough ---\n    # (e.g., draw two tiles identical to one of the initial tiles to form a koutsu)\n    print(2)\n\n# Call the solver function\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
