The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm Design for Rock-Paper-Scissors**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. The core is the cyclic nature of the players' moves.  Instead of brute-forcing all `n` rounds (which would be slow), I can leverage the fact that both players have repeating patterns.\n\nMy key insight is to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences, `A` and `B`. This LCM represents the length of a full cycle – a point where the game state repeats. The number of spots within one cycle can be determined by iterating and simulating the outcomes. I need to use the `math.gcd` to compute the LCM.\n\nI'm thinking of breaking it down: first, calculate `lcm(m, k)`.  Then simulate that number of rounds to count losses. I can use a helper function, `get_winner`, for comparing moves, which streamlines the main logic. After the initial LCM cycle, I can figure out how many full cycles fit into the total rounds (`n`).  Then just take care of the remaining rounds that are not a multiple of the LCM.\n\nEssentially, I'll calculate spots for a cycle and multiply that by the number of full cycles, then simulate the remaining part. This approach avoids the massive iteration needed for very large values of n, as it only needs to simulate cycles. The remainder is small relative to the potential size of n.\n\nI'll also keep the Python code modular to help avoid errors. The `get_winner` function is a separate module that keeps the main logic cleaner and more maintainable.\n\nLet's test it with the examples... Looks good. This approach is going to efficiently solve the problem. \n",
