After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Algorithm for \"Marks\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Marks\" problem.  It looks like a straightforward competitive programming challenge, and I need to write a Python script to solve it. Let's break down the requirements. I'm given `n` students and `m` subjects.  Each student's marks are provided as a single string of digits for each subject.\n\nFirst, I need to define what makes a student \"successful\". A student is \"the best\" at a subject if no other student scored higher in that same subject. A \"successful\" student is one who is \"the best\" at *at least one* subject. The goal is to output the total number of successful students.\n\nI'm thinking of how to structure the input. I can read `n` and `m` first. Then I can read in the gradebook, representing it as a 2D structure, either a list of strings or a list of lists of integers, where each row is a student's marks. For instance, `grades = [ \"223\", \"232\", \"112\" ]`.\n\nThe core logic requires processing by subject. For each subject (column), I need to find the maximum mark. Once I have the maximum mark for a subject, I have to iterate through the students to identify all those who achieved that maximum mark for that specific subject.\n\nLet's illustrate that with the example. In Subject 1, the maximum is 2, and both Students 1 and 2 got 2. So, they are best at Subject 1. Moving on to Subject 2, the max is 3, which Student 2 achieved. Finally, Subject 3 max is 3 with Student 1 as the only achiever.\n\nTo determine the final output, I need to iterate through each student and see if they were best in at least one subject. So, Student 1 is successful, being best in Subject 1 and 3. Student 2 is successful because he's best in Subjects 1 and 2. Student 3 is not best in any subject, so he is not successful. The answer in the example is 2 successful students.\n\nSo, here's the algorithm I'll implement:\n\n1.  Read `n` and `m`.\n2.  Read the grades into a 2D data structure, probably a list of strings or list of lists of integers.\n3.  Iterate through each subject (column):\n    *   Find the maximum mark for that subject.\n    *   Identify all students who achieved that maximum mark for the current subject.\n4.  For each student:\n    *   Check if they were best in at least one subject.\n    *   If yes, increment the successful student count.\n5.  Output the total count of successful students.\n\nThis should do the trick, keeping the overall structure in mind. Now, I need to translate this into Python code.\n",
