Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Array Stabilization**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The goal is to write a Python script to address the array stabilization problem, as I understand it: given an array `a` of integers, remove *exactly* one element to minimize the instability of the remaining elements. The instability is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\nMy understanding of the problem and its constraints is clear: the array size `n` ranges from 2 to 10^5, and the array elements `a_i` are also integers between 1 and 10^5.  I have also reviewed the provided examples, which are helpful in visualizing the problem.\n\nThe key insight, it seems, is that sorting the array makes the solution much more obvious.  By sorting, the minimum instability is achieved by either:\n\n1.  Removing the smallest element (which makes the second smallest the new minimum).\n2.  Removing the largest element (which makes the second largest the new maximum).\n\nRemoving any other element from within the sorted array is pointless as the range and instability stay the same.\n\nThe time complexity will be dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n). The remaining calculations are constant time. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the array.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  Read the input array `a` and its length `n`.\n2.  Sort the array `a`.\n3.  Calculate the instability after removing the smallest element (`a[n-1] - a[1]`).\n4.  Calculate the instability after removing the largest element (`a[n-2] - a[0]`).\n5.  Return the minimum of the two calculated instabilities.\n\nI believe this approach covers all possible scenarios and efficiently finds the optimal solution. The provided examples and edge cases also confirm my logic. I'm confident my python code will address this problem accurately.\n",
