A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm diving into this \"Soft Drinking\" problem. It's a classic resource allocation scenario. I need to figure out the maximum number of toasts each friend can enjoy, considering the constraints of drinks, limes, and salt.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the inputs: `n` is the number of friends, `k` is the number of drink bottles, `l` is the drink volume per bottle, `c` is the number of limes, `d` is slices per lime, `p` is the total salt, `nl` is the drink needed per friend per toast, and `np` is the salt per friend per toast.\n\nMy goal is to find the limiting factor – the resource that runs out first. To do that, I need to calculate how many toasts *each friend* can make based on each resource individually.\n\nFor drink, it's pretty straightforward: I'll calculate the total milliliters of drink, then how many toasts *all* friends can make, and finally divide that by the number of friends. I'll use integer division since we can't have partial toasts.\n\nThe same logic applies to limes. Calculate total slices, then toasts across all friends, then divide by the number of friends.\n\nFor salt, it's similar: calculate the total amount of toasts that can be made, and then divide by the number of friends.\n\nThe final answer will be the minimum of these three values. That's the key! The resource that allows for the fewest toasts sets the limit for everyone. I'll need to write this up into a Python script.\n",
