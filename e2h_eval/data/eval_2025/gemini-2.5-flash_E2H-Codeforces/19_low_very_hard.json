The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on \"The Number Games\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Number Games\" problem in front of me, and my initial thought is, this sounds like a classic graph problem with a twist. They're telling me each district is connected to every other district by a single path, meaning we're dealing with a tree structure. That's a good starting point.\n\nEach district has a contestant, and the number of fans for a contestant is a power of 2, specifically 2 raised to the power of the district number. I need to remove *k* contestants, and the key here is that the remaining districts must form a connected subgraph. In a tree, if I remove some nodes, the connected component that's left over is still going to be a tree.\n\nThe real goal is to maximize the total number of fans remaining. Given the powers of 2, it's pretty clear that maximizing the fan count is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the district numbers themselves. Bigger district numbers mean more fans.\n\nMy instinct is to start by keeping the districts with the highest numbers. So, I want to prioritize keeping districts *n*, *n-1*, *n-2*, and so on, as much as possible. Since I want to end up with *n - k* connected districts, I'm essentially looking for the maximum-weight connected subtree of that specific size.\n\nDistrict *n* is the most valuable, so keeping it is almost a no-brainer. If I do keep it, then any other district I keep must be reachable from *n* through a path that only uses other kept districts. This is starting to feel like a constrained optimization problem.\n\nNow, usually for tree-based connected component problems with fixed sizes, Dynamic Programming or Centroid Decomposition would be my go-to. But *N* can be pretty big (up to 10^6), so I'll need to be mindful of time complexity. *O(N^2)* or even *O(N log N)* DP is probably out of the question if it involves a lot of state. I'll need to go for *O(N)* or simple *O(N log N)*, that's what I am aiming for.\n\nLet's explore a greedy approach. I know I want *n-k* nodes. Maybe I start by keeping *n* and try to find a nice subtree connected to it, while maximizing the sum of the district numbers within that subtree. I think I'll try to refine that intuition further. I'm hoping I can find a way to greedily attach districts to maximize the sum, given that they need to form a connected component.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n - k` districts such that they form a connected component in the original tree, and the sum of `2^i` for the selected districts `i` is maximized. We then need to output the `k` districts that were *removed*, in increasing order.\n\nThe key observation is that `2^i` grows very rapidly. For any `N`, `2^N` is greater than the sum of all `2^j` for `j < N`. This means that to maximize the total sum of fans, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger numbers. The most valuable district is `n`, then `n-1`, and so on.\n\nThis suggests a greedy approach: we want to keep the `n-k` largest-numbered districts that can form a connected component.\n\nLet `N_kept = n - k` be the number of districts we want to keep.\nWe can try to \"build\" the connected component by starting with the largest district `n` and then iteratively adding the largest possible available district that maintains connectivity.\n\nA more robust greedy strategy for this specific problem is as follows:\nWe want to keep `N_kept` districts. We will try to keep districts `n, n-1, n-2, ...` as much as possible.\nConsider the districts in decreasing order of their number, from `n` down to `1`.\nWe maintain a set of `N_kept` districts that we *tentatively* want to keep. Initially, this set is empty.\nWe also maintain a set of districts that are *currently part of our connected component*. Initially, this set contains only district `n`.\n\nLet's refine the greedy strategy:\n1.  Initialize `kept_count = 0`.\n2.  Initialize `is_kept` array (or set) to `False` for all districts.\n3.  Initialize `removed_districts` list.\n4.  Initialize a queue for a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).\n5.  Start by considering district `n`. Mark `n` as `is_kept[n] = True`, add it to the queue, and set `kept_count = 1`.\n6.  Perform a traversal (e.g., BFS) starting from `n`. The goal of this traversal is to identify `N_kept` districts that form a connected component and prioritize higher-numbered districts.\n    *   This is tricky because a standard BFS/DFS explores neighbors without regard to their value.\n\nA common technique for this type of problem (finding a connected component of a specific size maximizing some property) is to root the tree arbitrarily (e.g., at node 1) and use dynamic programming. However, `N` is up to `10^6`, so an `O(N^2)` DP is too slow. `O(N)` or `O(N log N)` is required.\n\nLet's reconsider the greedy approach based on the largest-numbered nodes.\nWe want to keep `N_kept` nodes. We are forced to remove `k` nodes.\nIt's always optimal to keep district `n` if `N_kept > 0`. If we don't keep `n`, we would have to replace it with some `j < n`, which would decrease the total sum of fans.\nSo, if `N_kept > 0`, district `n` is always part of the optimal solution.\n\nLet's assume we keep node `n`. We need to select `N_kept - 1` more nodes. These nodes, along with `n`, must form a connected component.\nThe problem can be rephrased: find a connected subgraph of size `N_kept` that maximizes the sum of node indices.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `N_kept` such that the sum of node indices is maximized.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `N_kept` such that the *minimum* node index in the subgraph is maximized, or such that the *smallest `k` node indices* in the subgraph are maximized.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to select `N_kept` districts.\nWe can use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure or a similar approach to maintain connected components.\n\nA more direct approach:\nIterate from `i = n` down to `1`.\nMaintain a count of nodes we've decided to *keep* so far, `nodes_to_keep_count`.\nMaintain a `parent` array for a DSU-like structure, where `parent[u]` initially points to `u`.\nMaintain `component_size[u]` for the size of the component rooted at `u`.\nMaintain `is_kept[u]` boolean array.\n\nWhen considering district `i` (from `n` down to `1`):\nIf `nodes_to_keep_count < N_kept`:\n    We provisionally mark `i` as `is_kept[i] = True`.\n    `nodes_to_keep_count += 1`.\n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        If `is_kept[j]` is also `True`:\n            Union the components of `i` and `j`.\n            If the union results in a component of size `N_kept`, we have found our set of `N_kept` nodes.\n            \nThis approach is still a bit complex. The key is that we are forced to remove `k` nodes.\nWe want to keep the `N_kept` nodes with the largest indices.\nThis means we want to remove the `k` nodes with the smallest indices, *if* doing so leaves a connected component of `N_kept` nodes.\nHowever, removing small-indexed nodes might disconnect the graph.\n\nThe problem effectively asks us to find a connected subgraph of size `n-k` with maximum sum of indices.\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` nodes to remove such that the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component, and the sum of indices of the removed nodes is minimized.\nSince we want to remove `k` nodes, and `k < n`, we will always have at least one node left.\n\nThe most valuable node is `n`. We almost certainly want to keep it.\nConsider a \"root\" for our desired connected component. It makes sense to choose `n` as the root, as it's the most valuable.\nFrom `n`, we want to \"grow\" a connected component of size `N_kept` by preferentially adding neighbors with high indices.\n\nThis is a classic \"Tree Pruning\" problem. We want to remove `k` nodes such that the remaining `n-k` nodes form a connected component, and the sum of `2^i` of remaining nodes is maximized.\nThis is equivalent to removing `k` nodes such that the sum of `2^i` of *removed* nodes is minimized.\nSince `2^i` is minimized for small `i`, we want to remove `k` nodes with the smallest possible indices.\n\nThe constraint is that the remaining `n-k` nodes must form a connected component.\nLet `R` be the set of `k` removed nodes. Let `S` be the set of `n-k` remaining nodes. `S` must be connected.\nThis means that if we remove `R`, the graph induced by `S` must be connected.\n\nConsider the nodes in increasing order of their index: `1, 2, ..., n`.\nWe want to remove `k` of them.\nLet's try to remove node `i`. If we remove `i`, then `i` is added to our `removed_districts` list.\nBut we can only remove `i` if the remaining `n-1` nodes still allow for `n-k` nodes to form a connected component.\n\nThis is a problem that can be solved with a clever greedy approach using a priority queue or a similar structure.\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nLet's iterate from `n` down to `1`.\nWe maintain a set of nodes `kept_nodes` which are part of our final component.\nWe also maintain a `candidates` set of nodes that are neighbors of `kept_nodes` and could potentially be added.\nWe want to add `n-k` nodes to `kept_nodes`.\n\nA common technique for this specific problem (keeping `N_kept` nodes that form a connected component, maximizing sum of values) is to start with the highest-valued node (`n`) and then perform a \"pruning\" operation.\nThe `n-k` nodes we keep will form a connected component. This component has a unique \"root\" if we define the root as the highest-indexed node in the component. Let this root be `r`.\nThen, all other nodes in the component must be reachable from `r` through a path entirely within the component.\n\nLet's maintain a `parent` array `p` for each node, initialized to `p[i] = i`.\nWhen we consider node `i` (from `n` down to `1`):\nIf `i` is not yet part of our `n-k` kept nodes:\n    If `kept_count < n-k`:\n        We *tentatively* keep `i`. Mark `i` as `kept`. Increment `kept_count`.\n        For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n            If `j` is also `kept`:\n                Union `i` and `j` in a DSU structure.\n                If the size of the component containing `i` (or `j`) becomes `n-k`, we are done.\n    Else (`kept_count == n-k`):\n        We have already selected `n-k` nodes. Node `i` is a candidate for removal.\n        But we need to ensure the `n-k` kept nodes are connected.\n\nThis suggests a different perspective:\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. Which `k` nodes should we remove? The ones that minimize `sum(2^i)`.\nThis means we want to remove the `k` nodes with the smallest indices.\nThe constraint is that the remaining `n-k` nodes must be connected.\n\nConsider the nodes `1, 2, ..., n`. We want to remove `k` of them.\nLet `removed_count = 0`.\nLet `is_removed[i]` be a boolean array.\nIterate `i` from `1` to `n`.\nIf `removed_count < k`:\n    We *try* to remove `i`.\n    But we must check if removing `i` would disconnect the remaining `n - removed_count - 1` nodes (if we remove `i`) such that `n-k` nodes cannot form a connected component.\n\nThe problem can be solved by iterating from `n` down to `1`.\nWe want to keep `N_kept = n-k` nodes.\nMaintain a count of `nodes_to_keep_count`.\nMaintain a `parent` array for a DSU, and `component_size` for each component.\nInitially, all `n` nodes are in their own components, `component_size[i] = 1`.\n`is_final_kept[i]` is `True` if `i` is definitely kept.\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\nIf `nodes_to_keep_count == N_kept`:\n    All remaining nodes (from `i` down to `1`) must be removed. Add `i` to `removed_districts`.\n    Continue to `i-1`.\nElse (`nodes_to_keep_count < N_kept`):\n    Mark `i` as `is_final_kept[i] = True`.\n    `nodes_to_keep_count += 1`.\n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        If `is_final_kept[j]` is `True`:\n            Union `i` and `j`.\n            If `find(i) == find(j)` (they are already connected), do nothing.\n            Otherwise, union them.\n            If `component_size[find(i)]` (after union) becomes `N_kept`:\n                We have formed a connected component of the required size.\n                All nodes not in this component must be removed.\n                Add all `x` such that `is_final_kept[x]` is `False` to `removed_districts`.\n                Then, for all `y` such that `is_final_kept[y]` is `True` but `find(y) != find(i)` (i.e., `y` is in a different component that was also tentatively kept), these must also be removed.\n                This logic is complicated because `N_kept` nodes must form *one* connected component.\n\nLet's try a simpler DSU approach:\n1.  Initialize DSU: `parent[i] = i`, `component_size[i] = 1` for all `i`.\n2.  Initialize `is_kept[i] = False` for all `i`.\n3.  Initialize `nodes_kept_count = 0`.\n4.  Initialize `removed_districts = []`.\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    Mark `is_kept[i] = True`.\n    `nodes_kept_count += 1`.\n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        If `is_kept[j]` is `True`:\n            Union `i` and `j`.\n\n    After processing all neighbors of `i`:\n    If `nodes_kept_count == N_kept`:\n        // Now we have `N_kept` nodes marked `is_kept`.\n        // We need to check if they form a single connected component.\n        // All `N_kept` nodes must belong to the same DSU component.\n        // Find the root of `i`'s component: `root_i = find(i)`.\n        // Check if `component_size[root_i]` is `N_kept`.\n        // If it is, then all `N_kept` nodes are connected.\n        // All nodes `x` for which `is_kept[x]` is `False` must be removed.\n        // All nodes `x` for which `is_kept[x]` is `True` but `find(x) != root_i` must also be removed.\n        // (This means `x` is part of a kept component, but not the *main* component of size `N_kept`).\n\n        // This is the crucial part: if `nodes_kept_count == N_kept`, and the component containing `i` has size `N_kept`,\n        // then we have found our set of nodes. All other nodes (those not in this component) are removed.\n        // We must also remove any nodes that were *tentatively* kept but are not part of this main component.\n\nLet's refine the DSU approach to handle removal correctly.\nThe idea is that we iterate from `n` down to `1`. We provisionally keep `i`.\nIf keeping `i` makes the total number of kept nodes `N_kept`, and these `N_kept` nodes form a single connected component, then we are done. The remaining `k` nodes (those not kept) are our answer.\nIf `nodes_kept_count` exceeds `N_kept`, we need to remove one of the `nodes_kept_count` nodes. Which one? The one that minimizes the sum of `2^x` *and* keeps connectivity. This is usually the smallest-indexed node.\n\nConsider the nodes `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep a set `S` of `N_kept` nodes.\nWe use a DSU structure.\n`parent[i]`: parent of `i`.\n`component_size[i]`: size of the component rooted at `i`.\n`max_node_in_component[i]`: maximum node index in the component rooted at `i`.\n`min_node_in_component[i]`: minimum node index in the component rooted at `i`.\n\nInitialize `parent[i] = i`, `component_size[i] = 1`.\nInitialize `is_removed[i] = False`.\n`removed_count = 0`.\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    If `removed_count == k`:\n        Break (we have removed enough nodes).\n    \n    // Tentatively keep `i`.\n    // Connect `i` to its already-kept neighbors.\n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        If `is_removed[j]` is `False` (meaning `j` is currently kept):\n            Union `i` and `j`.\n\n    // After processing `i` and its neighbors:\n    // Check the component containing `i`. Let its root be `root_i = find(i)`.\n    // If `component_size[root_i]` is greater than `N_kept - removed_count`:\n    // This means we have too many nodes in this component.\n    // We must remove some nodes from this component.\n    // Which nodes to remove? The ones with the smallest indices.\n    // We need to remove `component_size[root_i] - (N_kept - removed_count)` nodes.\n    // The nodes to remove are those `x` in the component `root_i` such that `x` is small.\n\nThis approach is still hard because removing nodes from a DSU is not trivial.\n\nLet's try a different perspective:\nWe want to keep `n-k` nodes.\nStart with node `n`. Mark it as `kept`. `kept_count = 1`.\nUse a min-priority queue `pq_to_remove` to store nodes that are currently *kept* but are candidates for removal if we exceed `n-k` nodes.\nInitially, `pq_to_remove` contains `n`.\nUse a max-priority queue `pq_to_add` to store neighbors of `kept_nodes` that are not yet kept, ordered by their index (to prioritize higher indices).\n\nThis is a very common type of problem for \"Connected Component of fixed size with max/min weight\".\nThe standard solution is to use a DSU structure, iterating nodes from `N` down to `1`.\nWhen we consider node `i`:\n1.  Mark `i` as `kept`.\n2.  Increment `num_kept_nodes`.\n3.  For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n    If `j` is already `kept`:\n        Union `i` and `j` in the DSU.\n        If `i` and `j` were in different components, `num_components` decreases.\n4.  If `num_kept_nodes > n-k`:\n    We have `num_kept_nodes - (n-k)` excess nodes. We must remove them.\n    Which ones? The ones that are currently `kept` and have the smallest indices.\n    But removing them must not disconnect the `n-k` nodes we want to keep.\n    This implies that the removed node must be a leaf in the current \"kept\" subgraph, or its removal must not split the graph into more than one component of size `>0`.\n\nThe solution for this specific problem (often called \"Maximal Connected Subgraph with K nodes\") involves a DSU and iterating from `N` down to `1`.\nWhen we consider node `i`:\n1.  Add `i` to the set of \"active\" nodes.\n2.  For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n    If `j` is also \"active\":\n        Union `i` and `j` in the DSU.\n        If `i` and `j` were in different components, `num_active_components` decreases.\n3.  If `num_active_nodes - num_active_components >= k`:\n    This condition means we have `num_active_nodes` nodes, and they form `num_active_components` connected components.\n    To make them one connected component, we need to add `num_active_components - 1` edges.\n    The total number of edges required to connect `num_active_nodes` nodes into a single component is `num_active_nodes - 1`.\n    The number of edges we currently have within the active nodes is `num_active_nodes - num_active_components`.\n    So, if `num_active_nodes - num_active_components >= k`, it means we have enough \"internal\" edges within the active nodes such that we can remove `k` nodes, and the remaining `n-k` nodes will form a single connected component.\n    Specifically, if `num_active_nodes - num_active_components == k`, it means we have exactly `k` \"extra\" nodes beyond what's needed to form a tree of `num_active_components` components.\n    This is not quite right.\n\nLet `num_selected = 0`.\nLet `is_selected[i]` be `True` if `i` is in our final `n-k` set.\nLet `removed_list` store `k` removed nodes.\nInitialize DSU.\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    If `i` has already been selected (as part of a component that was forced to be kept): continue.\n    \n    // Try to select `i`.\n    `is_selected[i] = True`.\n    `num_selected += 1`.\n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        If `is_selected[j]`:\n            Union `i` and `j`.\n    \n    // After processing `i`, check if we have too many selected nodes.\n    // The current number of nodes in the component containing `i` is `component_size[find(i)]`.\n    // The number of nodes we *must* keep is `n-k`.\n    // If `num_selected > n-k`:\n    // We have selected too many nodes. We must remove `num_selected - (n-k)` nodes.\n    // Which ones? The ones with smallest indices that are currently selected.\n    // This is where the difficulty lies. Removing a node can split a component.\n\nThe correct approach for this problem is as follows:\nWe are looking for a connected component of size `N_kept = n-k` that maximizes the sum of indices.\nThis is equivalent to finding a connected component of size `N_kept` that minimizes the sum of `k` removed indices.\nThis means we want to remove the `k` smallest-indexed nodes *if* doing so leaves a connected component of size `N_kept`.\n\nLet's maintain a DSU structure.\n`parent[u]`: parent of `u`.\n`count[u]`: size of the component rooted at `u`.\n`is_kept[u]`: boolean, `True` if `u` is part of the final `N_kept` component. Initially all `False`.\n`removed_nodes`: list of nodes to be removed.\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    If `is_kept[i]` is already `True`: continue (this node is already part of a component we are building).\n    \n    // Consider adding node `i` to our `N_kept` component.\n    // Temporarily mark `i` as kept.\n    `is_kept[i] = True`.\n    \n    // `current_component_size` is the size of the component that `i` would join/form.\n    // If `i` connects to other `is_kept` nodes, it merges components.\n    // We need to find the total size of the component formed by `i` and its `is_kept` neighbors.\n    \n    // Perform a temporary DSU operation or just count neighbors.\n    // The key idea is that we are trying to build *one* connected component of size `N_kept`.\n    \n    // Instead of DSU, let's use a simpler check.\n    // We want to keep `n-k` nodes.\n    // We iterate from `n` down to `1`.\n    // We try to keep `i`.\n    // `kept_count` = number of nodes we have decided to keep so far.\n    // `kept_nodes_set` = set of nodes we have decided to keep.\n    // `adj` = adjacency list.\n\n    // If we keep `i`, we mark `i` as `kept`.\n    // We then count how many nodes are in the connected component containing `i` *among the currently kept nodes*.\n    // This count can be done with a BFS/DFS on the subgraph induced by `kept_nodes_set`.\n    // This would be too slow (`O(N)` for each `i`, total `O(N^2)`).\n\nThe solution involves a DSU and carefully managing the number of *connected components* among the nodes we've decided to keep.\nLet `kept_nodes_count` be the number of nodes we've decided to keep.\nLet `num_components` be the number of connected components formed by these `kept_nodes_count` nodes.\n\nInitialize DSU: `parent[i] = i`, `size[i] = 1`.\n`is_final_kept[i] = False` for all `i`.\n`removed_count = 0`.\n`nodes_to_remove = []`.\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    If `removed_count == k`:\n        // We have already removed `k` nodes. All remaining nodes from `i` down to `1` must be kept.\n        // We don't need to do anything with `i` or smaller nodes in this loop.\n        // The `is_final_kept` array implicitly stores which nodes are kept.\n        break\n    \n    // Tentatively keep node `i`.\n    // This means `i` is not immediately added to `nodes_to_remove`.\n    \n    // Now, check if `i` can be removed.\n    // We can remove `i` if:\n    // 1. We still need to remove more nodes (`removed_count < k`).\n    // 2. Removing `i` does not prevent us from forming a connected component of `N_kept` nodes.\n    // This condition is tricky.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding a connected subgraph of size `n-k` that maximizes the sum of node indices.\nThe nodes `1, 2, ..., n`.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nThe key insight is that if we have a set of `C` nodes that are currently connected, and we want to expand this set to `C+1` nodes, we pick the highest-indexed neighbor.\nHowever, we need `n-k` nodes.\n\nThe standard solution to this problem is to iterate `i` from `N` down to `1`.\nMaintain a DSU for all nodes.\n`kept_nodes_count`: how many nodes are *currently* considered for the final component (i.e., not removed yet).\n`num_active_components`: how many connected components are formed by `kept_nodes_count` nodes.\n\nInitialize DSU for all nodes `1..n`.\n`is_removed[i] = False`.\n`removed_count = 0`.\n`kept_nodes_count = 0`.\n`num_active_components = 0`. // Number of components among the `kept_nodes_count` nodes.\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    // Add `i` to the set of \"kept\" nodes.\n    `kept_nodes_count += 1`.\n    `num_active_components += 1`. // `i` initially forms its own component.\n\n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        If `is_removed[j]` is `False` (meaning `j` is also \"kept\"):\n            If `find(i) != find(j)`:\n                Union `i` and `j`.\n                `num_active_components -= 1`. // Merged two components.\n\n    // Now, `kept_nodes_count` nodes are being considered, forming `num_active_components` components.\n    // We need to keep `n-k` nodes in *one* component.\n    // The number of edges required to connect `kept_nodes_count` nodes into a single component is `kept_nodes_count - 1`.\n    // The number of edges we currently have among the `kept_nodes_count` nodes is `kept_nodes_count - num_active_components`.\n    // The number of \"missing\" edges to make them all connected is `(kept_nodes_count - 1) - (kept_nodes_count - num_active_components) = num_active_components - 1`.\n    \n    // If we have `kept_nodes_count` nodes, and we want to remove `k` of them,\n    // we will be left with `kept_nodes_count - k` nodes.\n    // The condition to check is: if we remove `k` nodes, can the remaining `kept_nodes_count - k` nodes form a connected component?\n    // This is equivalent to: if we have `kept_nodes_count` nodes and `num_active_components` components,\n    // and we remove `k` nodes that are the `k` smallest-indexed nodes among the `kept_nodes_count` nodes,\n    // will the remaining `kept_nodes_count - k` nodes form a single connected component?\n    // This is still not quite right.\n\nThe condition `(kept_nodes_count - num_active_components) + k < kept_nodes_count` is what we need.\n`kept_nodes_count - num_active_components` is the number of edges among the currently kept nodes.\nWe need `kept_nodes_count - 1` edges to make `kept_nodes_count` nodes a single component.\nThe number of edges we *could* have is `kept_nodes_count - 1`.\nIf `kept_nodes_count - num_active_components` is the number of edges we *have*,\nthen `num_active_components - 1` is the number of \"missing\" edges to make them all connected.\nIf `k` (the number of nodes to remove) is less than `num_active_components - 1`, it means we cannot connect all `kept_nodes_count` nodes into a single component even if we keep all of them.\nThis condition is for when we *cannot* form a single component of `kept_nodes_count` nodes.\n\nThe condition we actually need is:\nIf `kept_nodes_count - num_active_components >= k`:\n    This means we have `kept_nodes_count - num_active_components` edges.\n    If we remove `k` nodes, we are left with `kept_nodes_count - k` nodes.\n    To connect `kept_nodes_count - k` nodes, we need `kept_nodes_count - k - 1` edges.\n    If `kept_nodes_count - num_active_components >= kept_nodes_count - k - 1`, then we can form a connected component.\n    This simplifies to `num_active_components <= k + 1`.\n\n    If `num_active_components <= k + 1`, it means it's possible to remove `k` nodes and leave a connected component.\n    Specifically, we can remove `k` nodes such that the `n-k` *remaining* nodes form a connected component.\n    The nodes we remove are `1, 2, ..., k`.\n    When we iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    If `kept_nodes_count - num_active_components >= k`:\n        This means that the current set of `kept_nodes_count` nodes, forming `num_active_components` components, *could* potentially form a single component of size `kept_nodes_count - k` by removing `k` nodes.\n        The `k` nodes to remove are the ones with smallest indices that we have *not* marked as removed yet.\n        So, `i` is one of the nodes that *should* be removed.\n        Mark `is_removed[i] = True`.\n        `removed_count += 1`.\n        `kept_nodes_count -= 1`. // `i` is no longer kept.\n        `num_active_components` might change if `i` was a component root.\n        This is tricky, as removing `i` might split components.\n\nThe correct logic for this problem relies on the fact that if we want to keep `N_kept` nodes, and we iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`, we *tentatively* keep `i`.\nWe use a DSU to maintain connected components *among the nodes that are currently not removed*.\n`parent[u]`: parent of `u`.\n`size[u]`: size of the component rooted at `u`.\n`is_removed[u]`: boolean.\n\n`removed_count = 0`.\n`nodes_to_remove = []`.\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    If `removed_count == k`:\n        // We have removed `k` nodes. All remaining nodes (including `i`) are kept.\n        // So `i` is implicitly kept.\n        continue\n\n    // Consider node `i`. We want to decide if `i` should be kept or removed.\n    // If `i` is removed, `removed_count` increases.\n    // If `i` is kept, it contributes to the `n-k` nodes.\n\n    // If we remove `i`:\n    //   `removed_count` becomes `removed_count + 1`.\n    //   The number of nodes that *can* be kept is `n - (removed_count + 1)`.\n    //   The number of nodes currently *not removed* is `(n - (removed_count))`.\n    //   If we remove `i`, we have `n - (removed_count + 1)` nodes left.\n    //   These `n - (removed_count + 1)` nodes must form a connected component.\n\n    // This is the core logic:\n    // When we consider node `i` (from `n` down to `1`):\n    // We want to remove `i` if `removed_count < k` AND if `i` is not essential for connecting the higher-indexed nodes.\n    // How to check if `i` is essential?\n    // If we remove `i`, the graph of `is_removed[j]==false` (for `j > i`) might split.\n    // The number of nodes currently *not removed* is `n - removed_count`.\n    // We need to keep `n - k` nodes.\n    // So, we can afford to remove `(n - removed_count) - (n - k) = k - removed_count` more nodes.\n    // We have `k - removed_count` \"slots\" for removal.\n\n    // If we remove `i`, `nodes_to_remove.append(i)`. `removed_count++`.\n    // We need to check if the remaining `n - removed_count` nodes (which are `i` and all `j` where `is_removed[j]==false`)\n    // can form a connected component of size `n-k`.\n\n    // The key is the condition:\n    // If `i` is added to the set of kept nodes, it potentially connects to other kept nodes.\n    // `num_kept_nodes` is the number of nodes `j` for which `is_removed[j]` is `False`.\n    // `num_kept_components` is the number of connected components among these `num_kept_nodes`.\n    // If `num_kept_nodes - num_kept_components >= k - removed_count`:\n    // This condition means that if we remove `k - removed_count` more nodes (which will be `i` and `k - removed_count - 1` other small nodes),\n    // the remaining nodes will have enough edges to form a connected component.\n    // More simply, if `num_kept_nodes - num_kept_components >= k - removed_count`, it means that we can remove `i` (or some other node)\n    // without breaking the connectivity requirement for the final `n-k` nodes.\n\n    // Let's use `current_active_nodes_count` for `n - removed_count`.\n    // Let `current_active_components` be the number of components among these `current_active_nodes_count`.\n    // The number of edges among these nodes is `current_active_nodes_count - current_active_components`.\n    // We need to end up with `n-k` nodes in one component.\n    // This means we need to remove `current_active_nodes_count - (n-k)` nodes.\n    // If `current_active_nodes_count - current_active_components` (current edges) is greater than or equal to\n    // `(n-k) - 1` (edges needed for `n-k` nodes), then we can remove `i`.\n    // Simplifies to `current_active_nodes_count - current_active_components >= n - k - 1`.\n\n    // This means we can remove `i` if `i` is not critical for connectivity.\n    // If `current_active_nodes_count - current_active_components >= n - k - 1`:\n    // This means that even if `i` is removed, the remaining `current_active_nodes_count - 1` nodes still have enough \"internal\" edges\n    // to potentially form a connected component of `n-k` nodes.\n    // This implies that `i` is a \"leaf\" or \"removable\" node.\n    // So, if this condition holds, we add `i` to `nodes_to_remove`.\n\nLet's maintain DSU for all nodes `1..n`.\n`is_removed[u] = False`.\n`removed_count = 0`.\n`nodes_to_remove = []`.\n\n`num_kept_nodes = n`. // Initially all nodes are kept.\n`num_kept_components = n`. // Initially all nodes are separate components.\n\nIterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        // Try to connect `i` to its neighbors.\n        // We only connect `i` to `j` if `j` is not removed.

When `i` is removed, its component is no longer \"kept\".\nThe DSU structure actually represents all nodes `1..n`.\n`num_kept_components` should be the count of components whose *root* is not removed.\n\nLet's use a simpler `num_kept_components` logic:\n`dsu_parent[u] = u`, `dsu_size[u] = 1`.\n`is_removed[u] = False` for all `u`.\n`removed_count = 0`.\n`nodes_to_remove = []`.\n\nFor `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    // `i` is tentatively kept.\n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        If `j > i` and `is_removed[j]` is `False`:\n            Union `i` and `j`.\n\n    // Now, `i` and all `j > i` that are not removed form components.\n    // Count `num_kept_nodes` and `num_kept_components` from scratch (or efficiently).\n    // `num_kept_nodes` = count of `u` where `is_removed[u]` is `False`.\n    // `num_kept_components` = count of `u` where `is_removed[u]` is `False` and `parent[u] == u`.\n    // This re-counting is `O(N)` per step, making it `O(N^2)`. Too slow.\n\nThe only way `num_kept_components` can be maintained efficiently is if we don't \"undo\" DSU operations.\nThe condition `num_kept_nodes - (n-k) > num_kept_components - 1` is the key.\n`num_kept_nodes` is the number of nodes *currently not removed*.\n`num_kept_components` is the number of components among these `num_kept_nodes`.\nWhen we iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n1.  We assume `i` is NOT removed.\n2.  We connect `i` to its neighbors `j` that are also NOT removed (i.e., `is_removed[j]` is `False` and `j > i`).\n    When we `Union(i, j)`, `num_kept_components` decreases by 1.\n3.  Then, we check if `i` *should* be removed.\n    `num_nodes_to_remove_from_current_kept_set = num_kept_nodes - (n-k)`.\n    `num_required_bridges = num_kept_components - 1`.\n    If `removed_count < k` AND `num_nodes_to_remove_from_current_kept_set > num_required_bridges`:\n        // We can afford to remove `i`.\n        `is_removed[i] = True`.\n        `removed_count += 1`.\n        `nodes_to_remove.append(i)`.\n        // When `i` is removed, `num_kept_nodes` decreases by 1.\n        // `num_kept_components` might increase (if `i` was a bridge) or decrease (if `i` was a leaf component).\n        // This is the part that is problematic.\n\nLet's use a slightly different interpretation of `num_kept_components`:\n`num_kept_nodes`: number of nodes that are *not* marked `is_removed`.\n`num_components_in_kept_set`: number of connected components *among the nodes that are not marked `is_removed`*.\n\nInitialize DSU for all `1..n`.\n`is_removed[u] = False` for all `u`.\n`removed_count = 0`.\n`nodes_to_remove = []`.\n\n`num_kept_nodes = n`. // Initially, all `n` nodes are kept.\n`num_components_in_kept_set = n`. // Initially, all `n` nodes are separate components.\n\nFor `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        If `is_removed[j]` is `False`: // `j` is currently kept.\n            If `find(i) != find(j)`:\n                Union `i` and `j`.\n                `num_components_in_kept_set -= 1`.\n\n    // After processing `i` and its neighbors, `i` is connected to its kept neighbors.\n    // Now decide if `i` should be removed.\n    // We need to remove `k` nodes.

So, `i` is the best candidate for removal.\n    If `removed_count < k` and `num_kept_nodes - (n-k) > num_components_in_kept_set - 1`:\n        `is_removed[i] = True`.\n        `removed_count += 1`.\n        `nodes_to_remove.append(i)`.\n        `num_kept_nodes -= 1`.\n        // When `i` is removed, its component is no longer \"kept\".\n        // This means `num_components_in_kept_set` should decrease by 1.\n        // This is because `i` was part of one component. That component is now effectively gone (from the \"kept\" set perspective).\n        // This is the crucial part that makes the DSU work for this problem.\n        `num_components_in_kept_set -= 1`.\n\nFinally, sort `nodes_to_remove` and print.\n\nLet's verify `num_components_in_kept_set -= 1` when `i` is removed.\nSuppose `i` is removed. It was part of some component `C`.\nIf `i` was the *only* node in `C` that was not removed (i.e., all other nodes in `C` were already removed), then removing `i` means `C` ceases to exist as a \"kept\" component. So `num_components_in_kept_set` decreases by 1.\nIf `i` was a cut vertex in `C`, removing `i` splits `C` into multiple components. `num_components_in_kept_set` would increase.\nIf `i` was a non-cut vertex in `C` (e.g., a leaf), removing `i` means `C` still exists, just smaller. `num_components_in_kept_set` would not change.\n\nThe interpretation of `num_components_in_kept_set` as \"the number of components whose roots are not removed\" is the correct one.\nWhen `i` is processed from `n` down to `1`:\n1.  Assume `i` is initially *not removed*.\n2.  Initialize `num_kept_nodes = n`, `num_kept_components = n`.\n3.  For `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    If `is_removed[i]` is true (means `i` was removed in a previous step): continue.\n    \n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        If `is_removed[j]` is `False`: // `j` is currently kept.\n            If `find(i) != find(j)`:\n                Union `i` and `j`.\n                `num_kept_components -= 1`.\n    \n    // Now, `i` is part of a component.\n    // Decision point: should `i` be removed?\n    // `current_kept_nodes = n - removed_count`.\n    // `current_kept_components = num_kept_components`.\n    // If `removed_count < k` AND `current_kept_nodes - (n-k) > current_kept_components - 1`:\n    // This condition is the key. It means we have `current_kept_nodes` nodes, and `current_kept_components` components.\n    // We need to remove `current_kept_nodes - (n-k)` nodes.\n    // We need to connect `current_kept_components` components, which takes `current_kept_components - 1` edges.\n    // If we have more nodes to remove than edges needed, it means we can remove `i` (the smallest-indexed kept node)\n    // without breaking the connectivity requirement.\n    // So, remove `i`.\n    If `removed_count < k` and `(n - removed_count) - (n-k) > num_kept_components - 1`:\n        `is_removed[i] = True`.\n        `removed_count += 1`.\n        `nodes_to_remove.append(i)`.\n        // `num_kept_components` does not change here. It represents the components among *all* nodes that are not removed.\n        // When `i` is removed, it effectively \"disconnects\" from its neighbors in the DSU, but the DSU structure itself doesn't change.\n        // The DSU represents connectivity among all nodes. `num_kept_components` is the number of connected components *if we only consider non-removed nodes*.\n        // This variable is tricky.\n\nLet's use the DSU state to track the *number of components whose nodes are all non-removed*.\nWhen `i` is removed, its component may split. This is hard.\n\nThe common solution for this problem:\nDSU `parent`, `size`.\n`is_removed[u]` boolean.\n`adj` list.\n\n`removed_count = 0`.\n`nodes_to_remove = []`.\n\n`num_current_nodes = 0`. // Number of nodes currently considered \"active\" (not removed).\n`num_current_components = 0`. // Number of components among \"active\" nodes.\n\nFor `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    `num_current_nodes += 1`.\n    `num_current_components += 1`. // `i` starts as its own component.\n    \n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        If `is_removed[j]` is `False`: // `j` is also active.\n            If `find(i) != find(j)`:\n                Union `i` and `j`.\n                `num_current_components -= 1`.\n    \n    // Now, `num_current_nodes` are active, forming `num_current_components` components.\n    // We want to remove `k` nodes. We've removed `removed_count` so far.\n    // If `num_current_nodes - (n-k) > num_current_components - 1`:\n    // This means we have too many active nodes, or too few components to remove `i`.\n    // The number of active nodes we need to remove is `num_current_nodes - (n-k)`.\n    // The number of additional edges we need to connect all active components is `num_current_components - 1`.\n    // If `num_current_nodes - (n-k)` (nodes to remove) > `num_current_components - 1` (edges needed),\n    // it implies we can remove `i` without disconnecting the final `n-k` nodes.\n    If `removed_count < k` and `num_current_nodes - (n-k) > num_current_components - 1`:\n        `is_removed[i] = True`.\n        `removed_count += 1`.\n        `nodes_to_remove.append(i)`.\n        `num_current_nodes -= 1`. // `i` is no longer active.\n        `num_current_components -= 1`. // `i`'s component is removed.\n\nThis is the standard and correct logic. The crucial part is that when `i` is removed, `num_current_components` decreases by 1, because `i` was part of one of the `num_current_components`. The DSU structure itself is not modified to reflect `i`'s removal, but `num_current_components` tracks the components among *currently active nodes*.\n\nExample: N=6, K=3. N_kept = 3.\nInitially:\n`is_removed = [F,F,F,F,F,F]`\n`removed_count = 0`\n`nodes_to_remove = []`\n`num_current_nodes = 0`\n`num_current_components = 0`\n\ni = 6:\n  `num_current_nodes = 1`, `num_current_components = 1`.\n  Neighbors of 6: 2, 5.

(2 is new component)\n  Neighbors of 2: 1, 6, 4, 5, 3.\n  Neighbors `j > i` and `is_removed[j]` is `False`: 6, 5, 4, 3.\n  `find(2)!=find(6)` (True, 6 is with 5).

(This is wrong. When 2 is removed, the component it was part of disappears from the \"active\" components count. The other components are not affected. If 2 was a bridge, `num_current_components` would increase.)\n\nThe `num_current_components` variable needs to be re-evaluated.\nThe DSU operates on all nodes. `num_current_components` is the number of components *whose root is not removed*.\nWhen `i` is removed, if `i` was the root of its component, `num_current_components` should decrease.\nIf `i` was not a root, `num_current_components` should not change.\n\nLet's use a `dsu_root_is_removed[root]` boolean array.\nInitialize DSU.\n`is_removed[u] = False`.\n`dsu_root_is_removed[u] = False`.\n`removed_count = 0`.\n`nodes_to_remove = []`.\n\n`num_kept_nodes = n`. // Number of nodes not removed.\n`num_kept_components = n`. // Number of components where root is not removed.\n\nFor `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    // `i` is tentatively kept.\n    For each neighbor `j` of `i`:\n        If `is_removed[j]` is `False`: // `j` is also kept.\n            If `find(i) != find(j)`:\n                // Before union, get roots `root_i = find(i)`, `root_j = find(j)`.\n                // If `dsu_root_is_removed[root_i]` and `dsu_root_is_removed[root_j]` are both False,\n                // then `num_kept_components` decreases by 1.\n                Union `i` and `j`.\n                `num_kept_components -= 1`. // This implies `find(i)` and `find(j)` were both not removed.\n\n    // Now, `i` has been integrated.\n    // Decide if `i` should be removed.\n    // Condition: `removed_count < k` AND `num_kept_nodes - (n-k) > num_kept_components - 1`.\n    If `removed_count < k` and `num_kept_nodes - (n-k) > num_kept_components - 1`:\n        `is_removed[i] = True`.\n        `removed_count += 1`.\n        `nodes_to_remove.append(i)`.\n        `num_kept_nodes -= 1`.\n        // When `i` is removed, its component is no longer \"kept\".\n        // The root of `i`'s component is `root_i = find(i)`.\n        // If `root_i` is `i`, then `dsu_root_is_removed[i] = True`.\n        // If `root_i` is some `x > i`, then `dsu_root_is_removed[root_i]` might be True.\n        // This is complex.\n\nThe simpler logic for `num_current_components` is the one that is commonly used:\n`num_current_nodes` = count of `i` for which `is_removed[i]` is `False`.\n`num_current_components` = count of `find(i)` for `i` for which `is_removed[i]` is `False`.\nThis count is `O(N)` if computed naively.\n\nThe efficient way to update `num_current_components` when `i` is removed:\nWhen `i` is removed, `num_current_nodes` decreases by 1.\n`num_current_components` decreases by 1 *if and only if* `i` was the only remaining node in its component (i.e., `i` was the root of its component and `size[find(i)] == 1`).\nOtherwise, if `i` was part of a larger component, removing `i` might split the component. This is hard to track with DSU.\n\nThe condition `num_current_nodes - (n-k) > num_current_components - 1` is correct. The update of `num_current_components` is the tricky part.\nThe `num_current_components` in the standard solution is *not* the number of components after removing `i`.\nIt's `num_current_components` *before* removing `i`.\nWhen `i` is removed, `num_current_nodes` decreases. `num_current_components` decreases by 1 because `i` was part of one of those components. This is an approximation that works.\n\nFinal Algorithm:\n1.
