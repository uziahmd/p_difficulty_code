Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down Vanya and Cards**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem, and here's how I'm thinking about it. The goal is clear: figure out the fewest *new* cards Vanya needs to get the total sum to zero. But there are a few twists to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, I've got to consider what values are valid for the additional cards. They have to fall within a range: `-x` to `x`.  That range is key.  Now, looking at the starting point, Vanya has `n` cards already, and their sum is `S`. I need the total sum of *everything* to be zero. That means the extra cards' sum (`S_add`) must equal `-S`.\n\nThe real question is, how do I *minimize* the number of these extra cards?  My hunch is, to do that, I need to make each new card contribute as much as possible towards that negative sum.\n\nHere's my strategy: first, calculate the `current_sum` of the cards Vanya already has.  Then, figure out the `target_sum` of the additional cards needed - that's just `-current_sum`.\n\nNow I need to consider two cases. If the `current_sum` is zero, I'm done. Vanya doesn't need anything, so the answer is zero. If not, I've got to add cards to reach a sum of `-current_sum`.\n\nThe trick is using the most efficient cards possible. If the `current_sum` is positive, I should add cards with value `-x`.  If the `current_sum` is negative, the most efficient value is `x`.\n\nUltimately, I need to reduce the absolute value of the remaining sum as rapidly as possible, and the largest absolute value for a single card is `x`.  So, if I denote `target_sum_abs` as the absolute value of the `current_sum`, I can divide it by `x` and round up to find the minimum cards. In terms of code, using the ceiling function is the right approach. With integers, I can do it with `(target_sum_abs + x - 1) // x`.\n\nThat should get me to the right answer.\n",
