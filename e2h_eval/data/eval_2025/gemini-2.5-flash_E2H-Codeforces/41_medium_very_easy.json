There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing House Profits with Zoning Restrictions**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem, and it seems pretty straightforward given the constraints (N, H, M <= 50). My approach is to build a Python solution that efficiently handles the restrictions and maximizes profit.\n\nFirst, the core idea: I'll represent the maximum allowed height for each house using an array `house_heights`. Initially, all houses can be built to the maximum height `h`. Then, for each restriction (l, r, x), I need to update the maximum allowed height for houses within the range [l, r] to be the minimum of their current maximum and `x`.  This ensures that I adhere to all the zoning rules.\n\nThe key observation is that maximizing profit is achieved by maximizing the height of *each individual house*. Since the profit function is `a^2`, it's always better to have a higher allowed height (up to the restriction).  So, I just need to find the absolute maximum allowed height for each house after considering all restrictions.\n\nThe implementation is simple: I'll iterate through the restrictions, updating `house_heights` with `min(current_height, x)`. After processing all restrictions, I'll calculate the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights for each house.\n\nThe time complexity is O(N * M) because I need to iterate through M restrictions, and each restriction potentially affects all N houses. Space complexity is O(N) to store the maximum allowed heights. The constraint sizes make this polynomial time solution feasible.\n\nLet's quickly recap:\n1. Initialize `house_heights` to [h] * n\n2. For each restriction (l, r, x), update `house_heights[i]` with `min(house_heights[i], x)` for all i in [l-1, r-1]\n3. Calculate the total profit by summing the squares of values in `house_heights`.\n\nThe provided example walks through the logic and I am confident in this approach!\n",
