Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the TV Game Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"TV Game\" problem. The core is a competitive game with two players, Homer and Marge, dealing with a number `A` consisting of `2n` digits. Each player gets `n` moves, and in each move, they grab the leftmost digit of `A` and append it to their own running total (string representation). The target is to find the sequence of moves (H or M) that maximizes the sum of the final numbers, `S1 + S2`. The output should be a string of length `2n`, indicating the moves.\n\nI'm starting by clarifying the rules – it's crucial I don't misinterpret things. There's a particular point about appending digits, rather than simply taking them. This affects how the players' numbers are built.\n\nLet's work through the provided examples and how the game flows. For \"1234,\" using \"HHMM\", the calculation will be:\n\n1.  **H:** \"1\" becomes \"1\" (S1) and the number is now \"234\"\n2.  **H:** \"1\" becomes \"12\" (S1) and the number is now \"34\"\n3.  **M:** \"3\" becomes \"3\" (S2) and the number is now \"4\"\n4.  **M:** \"4\" becomes \"34\" (S2) and the number is now \"\"\nResult: 12 + 34 = 46.\n\nNow, with a clear understanding of the rules, I can start thinking about how to algorithmically solve this. Dynamic programming or a brute-force approach are potential directions, but since I'm trying to optimize the sum of the two integers, there might be a cleverer way to determine the optimal solution without exploring all possibilities. Perhaps some greedy strategy? It's time to devise an efficient Python script.\n",
