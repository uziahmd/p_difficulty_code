Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Final Transformation Calculation for String Substitutions**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem on my hands, and it's all about string manipulation and modular arithmetic. The core of it involves making substitutions within a string `s` based on a set of queries, and then calculating the final numerical value of the resulting string, all modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nMy initial thought was to simply build the expanded string `s` directly after all substitutions, but the string has the potential to grow exponentially large. If `s` is \"1\", and the replacement is \"11111,\" a second substitution of \"11111\" makes the initial s \"11111111111\" leading to a string that increases in size exponentially. The idea of doing this with such large constraints is not going to work.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the problems constraints: the initial string s has length of 10^5, number of queries `n<=10^5`, and a sum of the length of the string `ti` of 10^5. The modulus is also `10^9+7`.\n\nSo, the key realization is that I can't build the string explicitly. Instead, I need to focus on how each digit contributes to the final number. A number like \"xyz\" can be represented as `x * 10^2 + y * 10^1 + z * 10^0`. So, if I replace the digit 'd' with a string 't', which in turn contains digits 't_k t_k-1 ... t_0', 'd' should contribute `d * 10^p` to the total sum, while 't' contributes `t_k * 10^(k-1) + ... + t_0` with the power of 10. This leads me to keep track of two essential things for each digit d:\n\n1.  Its *value* within the final number.\n2.  Its *length* within the final number.\n\nLet's use `val[d]` to store the final numerical value that the digit `d` expands to, modulo `10^9 + 7`. And `len[d]` will store the length of the string that `d` eventually becomes, modulo `10^9 + 6` (because, due to Fermat's Little Theorem, `10^L mod M = 10^(L mod M-1) mod M` when calculating powers of 10).\n\nInitially, for each digit '0' to '9':\n*   `val[d] = d` (the digit itself, as an integer).\n*   `len[d] = 1` (because each digit initially has a length of one).\n\nHere's the trick: when a query \"di -> ti\" comes along, I need to update `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on the string `ti`. But I *can't* process the queries in the given order because subsequent queries could change digits that are *inside* a `ti`. I need to process in *reverse* order to capture the cumulative effects.\n\nSo, when I process a query \"di -> ti\", the new `val[di]` and `len[di]` must reflect the final expansions of the digits that make up `ti`. To do this for a query, I have to process all of the digits in `ti` and replace them with their respective values. This is when the modulus comes into play.\n\nLet's illustrate the process:\n*   Maintain `val[d]` and `len[d]` for digits 0-9.\n*   Process queries in reverse order.\n*   For each query \"di -> ti\":\n    *   Calculate the new `val[di]` and `len[di]` based on the current `val` and `len` values of the digits within `ti`.\n\nFor a string `T = c_1 c_2 ... c_k` (where the `c_i`s are digits):\n1.  `current_val = 0`\n2.  `current_len = 0`\n3.  For each digit `c` in `T` (left to right):\n    *   `current_val = (current_val * pow(10, len[c], M) + val[c]) % M`\n    *   `current_len = (current_len + len[c]) % (M-1)`\n\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, I'll have the correct `val[d]` and `len[d]` for each original digit. Now, I iterate through the initial string `s` and calculate",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit substitutions in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 10^9 + 7. The string `s` can grow very large, so we cannot explicitly construct it.\n\nThe key observation is that each digit `d` in the original string `s` (or in any `ti` string) ultimately expands into some final string. The value of this final string and its length are what matter. Since queries are processed sequentially and substitutions are cumulative (e.g., if `2->4` then `4->5`, then `2` eventually becomes `5`), this suggests processing queries in reverse order.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`. This is a prime number.\nLet `LEN_MOD = MOD - 1 = 1000000006`. This is used for exponents in powers of 10. By Fermat's Little Theorem, `a^b % MOD = a^(b % (MOD-1)) % MOD` for prime `MOD` and `a` not a multiple of `MOD`. This is crucial because lengths can become extremely large.\n\nWe maintain two arrays (or dictionaries) for each digit `d` from '0' to '9':\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value of the string that digit `d` ultimately expands to, modulo `MOD`.\n2.  `length[d]`: The length of the string that digit `d` ultimately expands to, modulo `LEN_MOD`.\n\n**Initialization:**\nInitially, each digit `d` expands to itself.\nFor `d` from '0' to '9':\n*   `val[d] = int(d)`\n*   `length[d] = 1`\n\n**Processing Queries (in reverse order):**\nWe read all `n` queries and store them. Then, we iterate through the stored queries from the last one to the first one.\nFor each query `di -> ti`:\nWe need to calculate the new `val[di]` and `length[di]` based on the string `ti`. The values `val[c]` and `length[c]` for digits `c` within `ti` should reflect their *current* (i.e., already processed by later queries) expanded forms.\n\nLet's calculate `new_val_di` and `new_length_di` for `ti`:\n*   `current_val = 0`\n*   `current_length = 0`\nIterate through each character `c` in `ti` from left to right:\n*   `current_val = (current_val * pow(10, length[int(c)], MOD) + val[int(c)]) % MOD`\n*   `current_length = (current_length + length[int(c)]) % LEN_MOD`\n\nAfter iterating through all characters in `ti`, update `val[int(di)] = current_val` and `length[int(di)] = current_length`.\n\n**Calculating the Final Answer:**\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `length[d]` will hold the final expanded value and length for each digit `d`.\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of the initial string `s` using these final `val` and `length` arrays.\n\n*   `final_ans = 0`\nIterate through each character `c` in the initial string `s` from left to right:\n*   `final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, length[int(c)], MOD) + val[int(c)]) % MOD`\n\nThe final `final_ans` is the required result.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem statement):**\n`s = \"123123\"`, `n = 1`, query: `2->00`\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    `val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `length = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n2.  **Process Queries (reverse order):**\n    Only one query: `di = '2'`, `ti = \"00\"`.\n    Calculate `new_val_2`, `new_length_2` based on `ti = \"00\"`:\n    `current_val = 0`, `current_length = 0`\n    *   For `c = '0'` (first char in `ti`):\n        `current_val = (0 * pow(10, length[0], MOD) + val[0]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 0) % MOD = 0`\n        `current_length = (0 + length[0]) % LEN_MOD = (0 + 1) % LEN_MOD = 1`\n    *   For `c = '0'` (second char in `ti`):\n        `current_val = (0 * pow(10, length[0], MOD) + val[0]) % MOD = (0 * pow(10, 1, MOD) + 0) % MOD = 0`\n        `current_length = (1 + length[0]) % LEN_MOD = (1 + 1) % LEN_MOD = 2`\n    Update: `val[2] = 0`, `length[2] = 2`.\n\n    After queries, `val` and `length` are:\n    `val = [0, 1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `length = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Answer from `s = \"123123\"`:**\n    `final_ans = 0`\n    *   For `c = '1'`: `final_ans = (0 * pow(10, length[1], MOD) + val[1]) % MOD = (0 * 10^1 + 1) % MOD = 1`\n    *   For `c = '2'`: `final_ans = (1 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (1 * 10^2 + 0) % MOD = 100`\n    *   For `c = '3'`: `final_ans = (100 * pow(10, length[3], MOD) + val[3]) % MOD = (100 * 10^1 + 3) % MOD = 1003`\n    *   For `c = '1'`: `final_ans = (1003 * pow(10, length[1], MOD) + val[1]) % MOD = (1003 * 10^1 + 1) % MOD = 10031`\n    *   For `c = '2'`: `final_ans = (10031 * pow(10, length[2], MOD) + val[2]) % MOD = (10031 * 10^2 + 0) % MOD = 1003100`\n    *   For `c = '3'`: `final_ans = (1003100 * pow(10, length[3], MOD) + val[3]) % MOD = (1003100 * 10^1 + 3) % MOD = 10031003`\n\nThe final answer is `10031003`, which matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Initialization:** O(10) time.\n*   **Reading Queries:** O(N + sum_of_ti_lengths) time.\n*   **Processing Queries (reverse):** N queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. Let `L_ti` be the length of `ti`. Inside the loop, `pow` takes `O(log(MOD))` time. Total time for this step is `O(sum(L_ti) * log(MOD))`. Given `sum(L_ti) <= 10^5`, this is efficient.\n*   **Calculating Final Answer:** Iterate through initial string `s`. Let `L_s` be its length. Each character involves `O(log(MOD))` time for `pow`. Total time is `O(L_s * log(MOD))`. Given `L_s <= 10^5`, this is efficient.\n\nOverall time complexity: `O((L_s + sum(L_ti)) * log(MOD))`.\nWith `L_s <= 10^5`, `sum(L_ti) <= 10^5`, and `log(MOD)` being around 30, this is approximately `(2 * 10^5) * 30 = 6 * 10^6` operations, which is well within typical time limits.\nSpace complexity: `O(N + L_s + sum(L_ti))` for storing input and queries, and O(10) for `val` and `length` arrays.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        di, ti = line.split('->')\n        queries.append((int(di), ti))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    LEN_MOD = MOD - 1 # For exponents in pow(10, exponent, MOD)\n\n    # Initialize val and length arrays for digits 0-9\n    # val[d] stores the numerical value of the string that digit d expands to\n    # length[d] stores the length of the string that digit d expands to\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for di_int, ti_str in reversed(queries):\n        current_val = 0\n        current_length = 0\n        \n        # Calculate the expanded value and length for ti_str\n        for char_t in ti_str:\n            t_int = int(char_t)\n            # current_val = (current_val * 10^(length of t_int's expansion) + val of t_int's expansion) % MOD\n            current_val = (current_val * pow(10, length[t_int], MOD) + val[t_int]) % MOD\n            # current_length = (current_length + length of t_int's expansion) % LEN_MOD\n            current_length = (current_length + length[t_int]) % LEN_MOD\n        \n        # Update val and length for di_int\n        val[di_int] = current_val\n        length[di_int] = current_length\n\n    # Calculate the final number from the initial string s\n    final_ans = 0\n    for char_s in s:\n        s_int = int(char_s)\n        # final_ans = (final_ans * 10^(length of s_int's expansion) + val of s_int's expansion) % MOD\n        final_ans = (final_ans * pow(10, length[s_int], MOD) + val[s_int]) % MOD\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_ans) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
