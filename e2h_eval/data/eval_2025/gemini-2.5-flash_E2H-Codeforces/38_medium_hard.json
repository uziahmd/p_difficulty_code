    "thought": "**The Journey of Solving a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nMy mind is now occupied with a fascinating problem: I'm tasked with finding both the smallest possible directed graph containing *p* pairs of nodes where one node can reach the other but not vice versa (let's call them \"unidirectional pairs\"), and, within that smallest graph, how to arrange things to maximize the number of those pesky unidirectional pairs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the definitions properly. A pair (u, v) is unidirectional if u != v, there's a path from u to v, but no path back from v to u. A directed graph is \"p-reachable\" if it has exactly *p* such pairs where u < v.\n\nMy thought process then broke the problem down by focusing on strongly connected components (SCCs). If two nodes are in the same SCC, they are bidirectionally reachable. If a strongly connected component has size k, we can pick any pair, and they will be bidirectional. This translates to k * (k - 1) / 2 such pairs where u < v. So, the total number of \"p\" pairs becomes a sum of these pairs over all the different SCCs in the graph, and the sum of sizes of all SCCs adds up to the total number of nodes, N.\n\nTo minimize the number of nodes (N), I should organize the SCCs so that fewer, larger SCCs generate the required number of unidirectional pairs efficiently. The math shows the function for generating unidirectional pairs (f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2) has a quadratic growth rate, which means large SCCs are better than many small ones. So, I will adopt a greedy strategy: find the largest SCC that contributes to *p*, subtract the contribution, and repeat this process until *p* becomes zero. With the greedy approach, the formula to find the appropriate value of k is k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2).\n\nFor the maximum number of unidirectional pairs, I realized that I needed to arrange the SCCs in a line. In this arrangement, I need to create a linear path where I'm going from one SCC to another, making those pairs unidirectional. By looking at all possible combinations, it turned out that N^2 - sum(k_i^2) is the actual number, but then I realized I was double-counting, so the correct formula is (N^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2, where N is the total number of nodes, and k_i is the size of each SCC. With these insights and formulas, I'm confident I can solve the problem efficiently.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `N` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with the minimum `N`, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\n\nLet's first understand the definitions:\n- An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is **unidirectional** if `u != v`, there exists a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\n- A directed graph is **`p`-reachable** if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n\nNodes `u` and `v` are reachable from each other if and only if they belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC are reachable from each other. The number of ordered pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` within this SCC is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nLet `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `N`**\n\nLet the graph have `N` nodes, partitioned into `m` SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. The total number of nodes is `N = sum(k_i)`.\nThe total number of `(u, v)` pairs with `u < v` and `u, v` reachable from each other is `p = sum(f(k_i))`.\nTo minimize `N` for a given `p`, we should use a greedy strategy:\nAt each step, find the largest possible `k` such that `f(k) <= p_remaining`. Add this `k` to `N` and subtract `f(k)` from `p_remaining`. Repeat until `p_remaining` becomes 0.\n\nThis strategy is optimal because `f(k)` is a convex function for `k >= 1`. To achieve a target sum `p` using `sum(f(k_i))`, we minimize `sum(k_i)` by making the `k_i` values as large as possible. This means using fewer, larger SCCs is more efficient in terms of nodes for a given number of `p` pairs.\n\nThe value of `k` can be found using the quadratic formula. `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p` implies `k^2 - k - 2p <= 0`. The positive root of `x^2 - x - 2p = 0` is `(1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2`. So, `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)`.\n\nAlgorithm for minimum `N`:\n1. Initialize `min_N = 0` and an empty list `K_values` to store the sizes of SCCs.\n2. While `p > 0`:\n   a. Calculate `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)`.\n   b. Add `k` to `min_N`.\n   c. Add `k` to `K_values`.\n   d. Subtract `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` from `p`.\n3. If `p = 0` initially, `k` will be `1` (since `f(1)=0`). This results in `min_N=1`. A single node graph has 0 `p`-pairs. This is correct as `u!=v` is required.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nLet `N` be the minimum number of nodes found, and `K_values = [k_1, k_2, ..., k_m]` be the sizes of the SCCs.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we need to maximize paths in one direction between different SCCs while minimizing paths in the reverse direction. This is achieved by arranging the SCCs in a linear chain in the condensation graph (the DAG of SCCs).\nFor example, we can arrange them as `S_1 -> S_2 -> ... -> S_m`. This means we add edges such that every node in `S_i` can reach every node in `S_j` if `i < j`, but no node in `S_j` can reach any node in `S_i` if `i < j`.\n\nConsider two distinct nodes `u` and `v`.\n- If `u` and `v` are in the same SCC, they are bidirectionally reachable. They do not form a unidirectional pair.\n- If `u` is in `S_i` and `v` is in `S_j` with `i < j` (in the chain arrangement):\n  - There is a path `u -> v`.\n  - There is no path `v -> u`.\n  - So, `(u, v)` is a unidirectional pair.\n  - The number of such pairs for a fixed `S_i` and `S_j` is `k_i * k_j`.\n- If `u` is in `S_i` and `v` is in `S_j` with `j < i` (in the chain arrangement):\n  - There is a path `v -> u`.\n  - There is no path `u -> v`.\n  - So, `(u, v)` is NOT a unidirectional pair (but `(v, u)` is).\n\nTherefore, the total number of unidirectional pairs `(u, v)` is the sum of `k_i * k_j` for all `i < j`.\nThis sum can be calculated as `1/2 * ( (sum k_i)^2 - sum(k_i^2) )`.\nSince `sum(k_i) = N`, this simplifies to `1/2 * (N^2 - sum(k_i^2))`.\n\nAlgorithm for maximum unidirectional pairs:\n1. After computing `min_N` and `K_values` from Part 1:\n2. Calculate `sum_sq_k = sum(k*k for k in K_values)`.\n3. Calculate `max_unidirectional_pairs = (min_N * min_N - sum_sq_k) // 2`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `p = 4`**\n\n**Part 1: Minimum `N`**\n1. `min_N = 0`, `K_values = []`. `p = 4`.\n2. `p = 4`:\n   a. `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*4)) / 2) = floor((1 + sqrt(33)) / 2) = floor((1 + 5.74) / 2) = floor(3.37) = 3`.\n   b. `min_N = 0 + 3 = 3`.\n   c. `K_values = [3]`.\n   d. `p = 4 - f(3) = 4 - (3*2/2) = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n3. `p = 1`:\n   a. `k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*1)) / 2) = floor((1 + sqrt(9)) / 2) = floor((1 + 3) / 2) = floor(2) = 2`.\n   b. `min_N = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n   c. `K_values = [3, 2]`.\n   d. `p = 1 - f(2) = 1 - (2*1/2) = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n4. `p = 0`, loop ends.\n   `min_N = 5`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum unidirectional pairs**\n1. `min_N = 5`, `K_values = [3, 2]`.\n2. `sum_sq_k = 3*3 + 2*2 = 9 + 4 = 13`.\n3. `max_unidirectional_pairs = (5*5 - 13) // 2 = (25 - 13) // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`.\n\nOutput for `p=4`: `5 6`. This matches the example.\n\n**Edge Case: `p = 0`**\n**Part 1: Minimum `N`**\n1. `min_N = 0`, `K_values = []`. `p = 0`.\n2. `p = 0`, loop condition `p > 0` is false. Loop does not run.\n   `min_N = 0`.\n   However, the problem implies nodes are distinct (`u != v`). A graph with 0 nodes cannot have any pairs. A graph with 1 node can't have `u!=v` pairs. So `N=1` is the minimum for `p=0`.\n   Let's adjust: if `p=0`, `min_N` should be 1. Or, the loop should run at least once to get `k=1`.\n   If `p=0`, `k=floor((1+sqrt(1))/2) = 1`. `min_N=1`, `K_values=[1]`, `p=0-f(1)=0`. This works.\n   So for `p=0`, `min_N=1`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum unidirectional pairs for `p=0`**\n1. `min_N = 1`, `K_values = [1]`.\n2. `sum_sq_k = 1*1 = 1`.\n3. `max_unidirectional_pairs = (1*1 - 1) // 2 = (1 - 1) // 2 = 0 // 2 = 0`.\n\nOutput for `p=0`: `1 0`. This matches the example.\n\nThe solution seems robust.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"1 0\")\n        return\n\n    min_n = 0\n    k_values = []\n\n    current_p = p\n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find the largest k such that k * (k - 1) / 2 <= current_p\n        # k^2 - k - 2*current_p <= 0\n        # Roots are (1 +/- sqrt(1 + 8*current_p)) / 2\n        # We need the largest integer k <= (1 + sqrt(1 + 8*current_p)) / 2\n        k = int(math.floor((1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * current_p)) / 2))\n        \n        # k must be at least 2 to contribute to p (f(1)=0)\n        # If current_p is positive, k will be at least 2 unless current_p is 0.\n        # But loop condition ensures current_p > 0.\n        # k=1 means f(k)=0, which would lead to infinite loop if current_p > 0 and k=1 is chosen.\n        # The formula for k naturally yields k >= 2 if current_p >= 1.\n        # For current_p = 1, k = floor((1+sqrt(9))/2) = 2. f(2)=1.\n        # This is correct.\n\n        min_n += k\n        k_values.append(k)\n        current_p -= (k * (k - 1) // 2)\n\n    # Calculate max unidirectional pairs\n    # max_unidirectional_pairs = (min_n^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2\n    sum_sq_k = sum(k * k for k in k_values)\n    max_unidirectional_pairs = (min_n * min_n - sum_sq_k) // 2\n\n    print(min_n, max_unidirectional_pairs)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
