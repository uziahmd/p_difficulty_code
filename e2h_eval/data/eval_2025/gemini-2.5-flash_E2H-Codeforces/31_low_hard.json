Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Vanya and Cards\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I need a Python script to solve the \"Vanya and Cards\" problem, a classic from the competitive programming realm.  My initial understanding is that Vanya has a set of cards, each with an integer value, and he wants the sum of all the card values to be zero. He's *found* some cards, and he can add more. The catch? The values on the cards are limited by an absolute value constraint, `x`.  So, the numbers on any card can range from `-x` to `x`, inclusive.\n\nThe input is straightforward: `n` and `x`, representing the number of initial cards and the maximum absolute value, and then the list of `n` card values. My goal is to determine the *minimum* number of additional cards Vanya needs to reach a zero sum.\n\nThe examples clarify things.  If the current sum is 2, and `x` is 2, I only need one card with `-2`. If the current sum is -4 and `x` is 3, I need two cards, one with `3` and one with `1`.  It's about minimizing the number of cards while getting that sum to zero.\n\nThe core idea is this:\n\n1.  Calculate the `current_sum` of the cards Vanya already has.\n2.  If it's already zero, we're done. Otherwise, the `target_sum_needed` is the negative of the `current_sum`.\n3.  The crucial part is figuring out how to achieve this `target_sum_needed` with the *fewest* additional cards. It's essentially a greedy approach:\n    *   If `target_sum_needed` is positive (meaning `current_sum` was negative), keep adding cards with the value `x` until the remaining sum is zero or negative. Then, add one final card with a value as needed to bring the total to zero.\n    *   If `target_sum_needed` is negative, use cards with the largest negative values (-x), until the remaining sum is zero or positive. Then add cards to reach zero.\n    *   I'll need to use the `//` operator for integer division to calculate how many cards I need.  The remainder of the division will tell me what value for a final, smaller card I need.\n    *   I need to handle both positive and negative target sums. I think I'm ready to write the Python now.\n",
