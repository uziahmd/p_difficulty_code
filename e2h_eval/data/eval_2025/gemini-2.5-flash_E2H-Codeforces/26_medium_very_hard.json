Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing Triangle Counting with Integer Sides**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to count non-degenerate triangles. The sides will be integers x, y, z, with constraints:  `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`. The triangle inequality is the key, of course: the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third. Because of the ordering imposed, the inequalities simplify significantly to just `x + y > z`.\n\nMy initial thought was a triple loop, but the ranges are so large (up to 5 * 10^5) that it'd be way too slow. I need a more efficient way.\n\nI'll fix `x` and `y` and then count the valid `z` values. For fixed `x` and `y`, `C <= z <= D`, and `z < x + y`. So, the number of valid `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe nested loop approach is still too slow. I need to get clever.\n\nLet `k = x + y`. Then I can rephrase the problem as finding the number of `(x, y)` pairs that sum to `k`, where `A <= x <= B` and `B <= y <= C`. I can precompute the number of such pairs for each possible `k`. Let's call this number `count[k]`.\n\nFor each `k` in the range `A + B` to `B + C`, I need to calculate `count[k]`. This involves finding the valid range for `x` (and thereby `y`). Then, I also need to calculate the number of valid `z` values which depend on k.\n\nFor z values, it boils down to checking if `C <= z <= min(D, k - 1)` so the counts are based on that and if k is <= C.\n\nFinally, the core idea: I'll iterate through all possible `k` values (from `A + B` to `B + C`) and for each `k`, compute both `count[k]` which is the number of (x,y) pairs summing to `k` and `z_count[k]` the possible values for z. Then multiply the counts to get my final answer.\n\nI will iterate `k`, and each iteration requires me to calculate `num_xy_pairs` which is the count of (x,y) pairs satisfying the conditions, and also calculating the `num_z_options` which is the count of z.\n\nThis will involve finding the maximum possible value of `num_xy_pairs`. This should be min(B - A + 1, C - B + 1).\n\nI need to make sure there are no integer overflows when multiplying. I believe Python's built-in integer type can handle large numbers without issues. The overall time complexity will be O(C - A), which, since C and A are up to 5 * 10^5, is O(5 * 10^5), which is perfectly acceptable.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` satisfying `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle. For sides `x, y, z`, the triangle inequalities are:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, it implies `x <= y <= z`.\nWith `x, y, z` being positive integers:\n- `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`, we have `x + z >= 1 + y > y`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n- `y + z > x`: Since `y >= x` and `z >= y >= x`, we have `y + z >= x + y > x`. This inequality is always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only condition we need to check is `x + y > z`.\n\nWe need to count triplets `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z` (which can be rewritten as `z < x + y`)\n\nA naive triple loop over `x, y, z` would be too slow given `D` can be up to `5 * 10^5`. The maximum number of combinations could be around `(5 * 10^5)^3`.\n\nWe can optimize this by iterating over `x` and `y`, and for each pair, count valid `z` values.\nFor fixed `x` and `y`, the conditions for `z` are `C <= z <= D` and `z < x + y`.\nCombining these, `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a fixed `x` and `y` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nThe sum would be `sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThis nested loop `(B-A+1) * (C-B+1)` can still be up to `(5 * 10^5)^2 = 2.5 * 10^{11}` in the worst case (e.g., `A=1, B=2.5e5, C=5e5`), which is too slow.\n\nLet's introduce `k = x + y`. The condition `z < x + y` becomes `z < k`.\nThe range for `k` is `A + B <= k <= B + C`.\nWe can rewrite the sum as `sum_{k=A+B}^{B+C} (count(x, y | x+y=k) * num_z_options(k))`.\n\nLet's define `num_z_options(k)`:\nThis is the number of integers `z` such that `C <= z <= D` and `z < k`.\nSo, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, k - 1)]`.\n- If `k - 1 < C` (i.e., `k <= C`), there are no valid `z` values. `num_z_options(k) = 0`.\n- If `C <= k - 1 <= D` (i.e., `C+1 <= k <= D+1`), `z` is in `[C, k-1]`. The count is `(k - 1) - C + 1 = k - C`.\n- If `k - 1 > D` (i.e., `k > D+1`), `z` is in `[C, D]`. The count is `D - C + 1`.\n\nNow, let's find `count(x, y | x+y=k)`:\nThis is the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `x + y = k`.\nFrom `x + y = k`, we have `y = k - x`.\nSubstituting `y` into its range: `B <= k - x <= C`.\nThis implies `k - C <= x <= k - B`.\nCombining with `A <= x <= B`, `x` must be in the range `[max(A, k - C), min(B, k - B)]`.\nLet `L_x = max(A, k - C)` and `R_x = min(B, k - B)`.\nThe number of such `x` values (and thus `(x,y)` pairs) is `max(0, R_x - L_x + 1)`.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n1. Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n2. Iterate `k` from `A + B` to `B + C`.\n   a. Calculate `L_x = max(A, k - C)`.\n   b. Calculate `R_x = min(B, k - B)`.\n   c. Calculate `num_xy_pairs = max(0, R_x - L_x + 1)`.\n   d. Calculate `num_z_options`:\n      If `k <= C`: `num_z_options = 0`.\n      Else if `k <= D + 1`: `num_z_options = k - C`.\n      Else (`k > D + 1`): `num_z_options = D - C + 1`.\n   e. Add `num_xy_pairs * num_z_options` to `total_triangles`.\n3. Print `total_triangles`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n- The loop for `k` runs from `A+B` to `B+C`. The maximum value for `B+C` is `5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`.\n- The number of iterations is `(B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = C - A + 1`. In the worst case, `A=1, C=5*10^5`, so `5*10^5` iterations.\n- Inside the loop, calculations are constant time.\n- Total time complexity: `O(MAX_VAL)`, where `MAX_VAL` is `5 * 10^5`. This is efficient enough.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4):**\n- `x` in `[1, 2]`, `y` in `[2, 3]`, `z` in `[3, 4]`.\n- `k` ranges from `A+B=3` to `B+C=5`.\n- `total_triangles = 0`.\n\n- **k = 3:**\n  - `L_x = max(1, 3-3) = 1`. `R_x = min(2, 3-2) = 1`. `num_xy_pairs = max(0, 1-1+1) = 1`. (Pair `(1,2)`)\n  - `num_z_options`: `k=3 <= C=3`. So `num_z_options = 0`.\n  - `total_triangles += 1 * 0 = 0`.\n\n- **k = 4:**\n  - `L_x = max(1, 4-3) = 1`. `R_x = min(2, 4-2) = 2`. `num_xy_pairs = max(0, 2-1+1) = 2`. (Pairs `(1,3), (2,2)`)\n  - `num_z_options`: `C=3 < k=4 <= D+1=5`. So `num_z_options = k - C = 4 - 3 = 1`. (Valid `z` is `3`)\n  - `total_triangles += 2 * 1 = 2`.\n  - Triangles: `(1,3,3)`, `(2,2,3)`.\n\n- **k = 5:**\n  - `L_x = max(1, 5-3) = 2`. `R_x = min(2, 5-2) = 2`. `num_xy_pairs = max(0, 2-2+1) = 1`. (Pair `(2,3)`)\n  - `num_z_options`: `C=3 < k=5 <= D+1=5`. So `num_z_options = k - C = 5 - 3 = 2`. (Valid `z` are `3, 4`)\n  - `total_triangles += 1 * 2 = 2`.\n  - Triangles: `(2,3,3)`, `(2,3,4)`.\n\n- Final `total_triangles = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4`. This matches the example output.\n\nPython's integers handle arbitrary size, so overflow for `total_triangles` is not an issue. The maximum possible value for `total_triangles` can be estimated as `(C-A+1) * (max_num_xy_pairs) * (max_num_z_options)`. Max `max_num_xy_pairs` is roughly `2.5*10^5` (e.g., `A=1, B=2.5e5, C=5e5`). Max `max_num_z_options` is `5*10^5`. Max `C-A+1` is `5*10^5`. So the product can be up to `5e5 * 2.5e5 * 5e5 = 6.25 * 10^{16}`, which fits in a 64-bit integer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    total_triangles = 0\n\n    # Iterate k = x + y\n    # The minimum sum x+y is A+B\n    # The maximum sum x+y is B+C\n    for k in range(A + B, B + C + 1):\n        # Calculate num_xy_pairs: number of (x, y) pairs such that A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, and x + y = k\n        # y = k - x\n        # B <= k - x <= C  =>  k - C <= x <= k - B\n        # Combined with A <= x <= B, we need x in [max(A, k - C), min(B, k - B)]\n        \n        L_x = max(A, k - C)\n        R_x = min(B, k - B)\n        \n        num_xy_pairs = max(0, R_x - L_x + 1)\n        \n        if num_xy_pairs == 0:\n            continue # No (x,y) pairs for this k, so no triangles\n\n        # Calculate num_z_options: number of z values such that C <= z <= D and z < k\n        # This means z must be in [C, min(D, k - 1)]\n        \n        num_z_options = 0\n        if k <= C:\n            # If k <= C, then k-1 < C.
