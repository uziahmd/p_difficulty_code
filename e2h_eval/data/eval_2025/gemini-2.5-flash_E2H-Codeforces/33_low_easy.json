You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"Replacing Digits\" Problem with a Greedy Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. The input is an integer represented as a string, `a`, and a sequence of digits, `s`.  The goal is to maximize the value of `a` by replacing some of its digits with digits from `s`, using each digit in `s` at most once.  My expert intuition is screaming \"greedy algorithm!\"  To get the largest possible number, I need to make the leftmost, or most significant, digits as big as possible.\n\nHere's how I'm thinking I'll approach it:\n\nFirst, I'll need to analyze the constraints.  I've got strings, the lengths can be up to 10^5, so I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.  I also need to be careful about not introducing leading zeros, which isn't a problem because I'm just replacing digits *within* `a`.\n\nThe core idea is this: I'll go through the digits of `a` from left to right. For each digit in `a`, I'll check if I can replace it with a *larger* digit from `s`.  I'll sort the digits of `s` in descending order so I can grab the largest ones quickly. I can use an index `s_ptr` to keep track of the available digits from `s`.\n\nIf the current digit in `s` is greater than the current digit in `a`, I'll do the swap and increment the `s_ptr`. If not, I'll move on to the next digit in `a`.  This greedy strategy should guarantee the maximum result. I don't need to consider using a digit from `s` to replace if it is not greater than the current digit in `a`, because this wouldn't result in a larger number.\n\nSo, in Python code, I would do something like this: convert the strings to lists, sort `s` (in reverse), iterate through `a`, and perform the greedy replacements as described above.  Finally, I can convert the modified list of `a` back into a string and return it.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize an integer `a` by replacing some of its digits with digits from a sequence `s`. Each digit from `s` can be used at most once.\n\nTo maximize a number, we should try to make its most significant digits (leftmost) as large as possible. This suggests a greedy approach:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Leftmost Digits:** Iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right.\n2.  **Use Largest Available Replacement:** For each digit `a[i]`, we want to replace it with the largest possible digit from `s` that is strictly greater than `a[i]`. If we can't find such a digit, or if the largest available digit from `s` is not greater than `a[i]`, we should not replace `a[i]` because replacing it with a smaller or equal digit would not improve the number at this significant position, and we want to save larger digits from `s` for potentially more significant positions (which we've already processed) or later positions where they might be strictly greater.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Convert the input number `a` into a mutable structure, like a list of characters.\n2.  Convert the sequence `s` into a list of digits (integers) and sort it in **descending order**. This allows us to easily pick the largest available digit from `s`.\n3.  Initialize a pointer `s_ptr` to 0, pointing to the largest digit in the sorted `s`.\n4.  Iterate through the digits of `a` from index `i = 0` to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of `a`):\n    *   Check if there are still digits left in `s` to use (`s_ptr < m`, where `m` is the length of `s`).\n    *   If `s_ptr < m` and the digit at `s[s_ptr]` (which is the largest available digit from `s`) is strictly greater than the current digit `a[i]`:\n        *   Replace `a[i]` with `s[s_ptr]`.\n        *   Increment `s_ptr` to mark this digit from `s` as used.\n    *   Otherwise (if `s_ptr >= m` or `s[s_ptr]` is not greater than `a[i]`):\n        *   We cannot improve `a[i]` with the largest available digit from `s`. Since we prioritize leftmost digits and want to use the largest possible replacement, we move on to the next digit of `a` without making a replacement at this position.\n5.  Finally, join the characters in the modified list `a` back into a string and print it.\n\n**Example:**\n`a = \"1024\"`, `s = \"010\"`\n\n1.  `a_list = ['1', '0', '2', '4']`\n2.  `s_list = ['1', '0', '0']` (sorted descending)\n3.  `s_ptr = 0`\n\n*   **i = 0 (a[0] = '1'):**\n    *   `s_ptr = 0`, `s_list[0] = '1'`.\n    *   `int(s_list[0])` (1) is NOT strictly greater than `int(a_list[0])` (1).\n    *   No replacement.\n*   **i = 1 (a[1] = '0'):**\n    *   `s_ptr = 0`, `s_list[0] = '1'`.\n    *   `int(s_list[0])` (1) IS strictly greater than `int(a_list[1])` (0).\n    *   Replace `a_list[1]` with `'1'`. `a_list` becomes `['1', '1', '2', '4']`.\n    *   Increment `s_ptr` to 1.\n*   **i = 2 (a[2] = '2'):**\n    *   `s_ptr = 1`, `s_list[1] = '0'`.\n    *   `int(s_list[1])` (0) is NOT strictly greater than `int(a_list[2])` (2).\n    *   No replacement.\n*   **i = 3 (a[3] = '4'):**\n    *   `s_ptr = 1`, `s_list[1] = '0'`.\n    *   `int(s_list[1])` (0) is NOT strictly greater than `int(a_list[3])` (4).\n    *   No replacement.\n\nFinal `a_list` is `['1', '1', '2', '4']`. Output: `1124`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we always make the locally optimal choice (largest possible digit at the most significant position) which leads to the globally optimal solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    a_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    s_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    a_list = list(a_str)\n    \n    # Convert s to a list of digits and sort in descending order\n    # This allows us to easily pick the largest available digit from s\n    s_digits = sorted([int(d) for d in s_str], reverse=True)\n    \n    s_ptr = 0 # Pointer for the sorted s_digits list\n    n = len(a_list)\n    m = len(s_digits)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if s_ptr >= m:\n            # No more digits in s to use\n            break\n        \n        current_a_digit = int(a_list[i])\n        largest_s_digit = s_digits[s_ptr]\n\n        if largest_s_digit > current_a_digit:\n            # If the largest available digit from s is greater than current a_digit,\n            # replace it to maximize the number.\n            a_list[i] = str(largest_s_digit)\n            s_ptr += 1 # Move to the next largest digit in s\n        # Else (if largest_s_digit <= current_a_digit),\n        # we don't replace, as it wouldn't improve the number at this position\n        # or would make it smaller.
