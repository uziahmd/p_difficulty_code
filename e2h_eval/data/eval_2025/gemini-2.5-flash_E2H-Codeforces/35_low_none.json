Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements. The next line contains n space-separated integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 104) — elements of array a.The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m. Number m equals .\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the maximum value of function f(x) for all .\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\n### Output\n['3', '27']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case m = 20 = 1, f(0) = 0, f(1) = a0 = 3.In the second sample m = 20 + 21 + 23 = 11, the maximum value of function equals f(5) = a0 + a2 = 17 + 10 = 27.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Find Maximum\" Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got a handle on the \"Find Maximum\" problem now. We're given an array `a` of integers and a binary string `s` that defines an upper bound `m`. The goal is to maximize a function `f(x)`, where `x` ranges from 0 up to and including `m`.  The function `f(x)` is pretty interesting: it sums up elements from `a` where the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1. \n\nThe crux of this lies in understanding `m`. It's a binary representation, built from `s`. `s`'s digits correspond to the powers of two in decreasing order (most significant bit first). So, the first bit in `s` represents `2^(n-1)`, the second bit `2^(n-2)`, and so on.\n\nI need to iterate through all possible values of `x` from 0 to `m`, calculate `f(x)` for each, and keep track of the maximum.  The example provided is a bit confusing. After going through it I'm still coming to the same conclusion, which is `8`.  I'll double-check it later and then proceed to coding a solution, probably using bitwise operations for efficiency. The key will be efficiently checking which bits are set in each `x` and adding the corresponding elements of `a`. The constraints seem reasonable, with `n` up to 10^5, so I can probably use a straightforward approach.\n",
