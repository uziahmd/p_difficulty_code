Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Colored Boots Problem: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Colored Boots\" problem to tackle, and it's screaming \"matching\" to me.  We've got these left and right boots, each with a color, and the goal is to maximize the compatible pairs. The constraints seem reasonable – nothing too crazy, so I can probably get away with a decent greedy strategy.\n\nFirst, I need to really understand what \"compatible\" means. Identical colors are always good, and anything pairs with a question mark ('?').  That sounds pretty straightforward.\n\nMy initial thought is to categorize the boots. We have specific colors, like 'a', 'b', etc., and then these question mark boots, which are effectively wildcards.  Given the rules, it seems intuitive to prioritize those specific, restrictive matches. If I don't match identical colors immediately, I might lose those pairs forever.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1. **Exact Matches First:** I'll iterate through all the specific colors from 'a' to 'z'. For each color, I'll identify all the left and right boots of that color. Then, I'll pair them up, creating a list of pairs. This is the most restrictive match; if they don't go together, they are lost!\n\n2. **Categorization:** I'll keep track of the remaining boots. I'll maintain lists for each color (for left and right boots).  Then there are lists for the question mark boots. So, `left_indices['a']` will contain the indices of left boots with color 'a', `right_indices['b']` will contain the indices of right boots with color 'b', etc. And, of course, `left_q_indices` and `right_q_indices` will keep track of those question mark boots.\n\n3. **Phase 1: Specific Color to Specific Color:** For each color from 'a' to 'z', I'll keep pulling pairs of left and right boots of the same color from my `left_indices` and `right_indices` lists until one of them is empty.  I'll store these pairs in a separate `pairs` list.\n\nThis seems like the most logical starting point. The specific matches are crucial, so I need to nail them down first. Then, I can deal with the question marks. It is critical to start with a good data structure, and lists of indices seems a clean way to go!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots and to print these pairs. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color (specific or indefinite).\n\nWe need to maximize pairs, and each boot can be used in at most one pair. This suggests a greedy approach. The key idea is to prioritize more restrictive matches first, as these boots have fewer options.\n\nLet's categorize the boots and their potential matches:\n- **Specific color boots:** 'a' through 'z'.\n- **Indefinite color boots:** '?'.\n\nThe compatibility rules imply a hierarchy of match \"strictness\":\n1. **Specific color to specific color (same color):** This is the most restrictive. A left 'f' boot can only match a right 'f' boot if both are specific colors. If it doesn't find an 'f', it might still match a '?' right boot, but an 'f' specific right boot might only match an 'f' specific left boot (or a '?' left boot).\n2. **Specific color to indefinite color ('?'):** Less restrictive. A specific color boot can match any '?' boot. A '?' boot can match any specific color boot.\n3. **Indefinite color to indefinite color ('?'):** Least restrictive. A '?' boot can match any other '?' boot.\n\nBased on this, a greedy strategy would be:\n\n**Step 1: Store Boot Indices**\nFirst, organize the boots by color. We'll use lists to store the 1-based indices of boots for each color.\n- `left_boots_by_color[char_code]` will store indices of left boots with a specific color `char_code` (e.g., 'a' is `ord('a') - ord('a') = 0`).\n- `right_boots_by_color[char_code]` will store indices of right boots with a specific color `char_code`.\n- `left_q_indices` will store indices of left boots with '?'.\n- `right_q_indices` will store indices of right boots with '?'.\n\n**Step 2: Match Specific Color to Specific Color (e.g., 'a' to 'a')**\nFor each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n- While there are available left boots of color `c` AND available right boots of color `c`:\n  - Take one left boot and one right boot of color `c` and form a pair. Add this pair to our `result_pairs` list.\n  - Remove these boots from their respective lists (e.g., using `pop()`).\n\nThis ensures that boots that can only match a specific same-colored boot are paired up first. Any remaining specific-colored boots (if one side ran out) will still be available for matching with '?' boots.\n\n**Step 3: Match Remaining Specific Color to Indefinite Color ('?')**\nAfter Step 2, some specific-colored boots might remain (if their exact color match ran out). Also, all '?' boots are still available.\nFor each specific color `c` from 'a' to 'z':\n- While there are remaining left boots of color `c` AND available right '?' boots:\n  - Take one left boot of color `c` and one right '?' boot and form a pair. Add this pair to `result_pairs`.\n  - Remove these boots from their lists.\n- While there are available left '?' boots AND remaining right boots of color `c`:\n  - Take one left '?' boot and one right boot of color `c` and form a pair. Add this pair to `result_pairs`.\n  - Remove these boots from their lists.\n\nThis step pairs up specific-colored boots with any available '?' boots, utilizing the flexibility of '?'.\n\n**Step 4: Match Remaining Indefinite Color to Indefinite Color ('?')**\nFinally, any remaining '?' left boots and '?' right boots can be paired with each other.\n- While there are available left '?' boots AND available right '?' boots:\n  - Take one left '?' boot and one right '?' boot and form a pair. Add this pair to `result_pairs`.\n  - Remove these boots from their lists.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\nLet `n=3`, `l=\"a?b\"`, `r=\"?ca\"`.\n1. **Store indices:**\n   `left_boots_by_color['a'] = [1]`\n   `left_boots_by_color['b'] = [3]`\n   `left_q_indices = [2]`\n   `right_boots_by_color['c'] = [2]`\n   `right_boots_by_color['a'] = [3]`\n   `right_q_indices = [1]`\n\n2. **Specific to Specific:**\n   - For 'a': `left_boots_by_color['a']=[1]`, `right_boots_by_color['a']=[3]`. Pair (1, 3).\n     `result_pairs = [(1, 3)]`\n     `left_boots_by_color['a'] = []`, `right_boots_by_color['a'] = []`\n   - For 'b': No right 'b'.\n   - For 'c': No left 'c'.\n   (Other colors are empty)\n\n3. **Specific to '?':**\n   - For 'a': No left 'a', no right 'a' (already used).\n   - For 'b': `left_boots_by_color['b']=[3]`. `right_q_indices=[1]`. Pair (3, 1).\n     `result_pairs = [(1, 3), (3, 1)]`\n     `left_boots_by_color['b'] = []`, `right_q_indices = []`\n   - For 'c': `right_boots_by_color['c']=[2]`. `left_q_indices=[2]`. Pair (2, 2).\n     `result_pairs = [(1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 2)]`\n     `right_boots_by_color['c'] = []`, `left_q_indices = []`\n\n4. **'?' to '?':**\n   `left_q_indices` is empty, `right_q_indices` is empty. No more pairs.\n\nFinal `result_pairs`: `[(1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 2)]`. Total 3 pairs.\n\nThis greedy strategy covers all cases and maximizes pairs because it prioritizes the most restrictive matches, leaving the more flexible '?' boots for later, when they can fill any remaining gaps.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Use `collections.defaultdict(list)` or a list of lists of size 26 for `left_boots_by_color` and `right_boots_by_color`.\n- `ord(char) - ord('a')` can convert a character to an index 0-25.\n- The indices should be 1-based in the output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-based indices of boots\n    left_boots_by_color = defaultdict(list)\n    right_boots_by_color = defaultdict(list)\n    left_q_indices = []\n    right_q_indices = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l_str[i] == '?':\n            left_q_indices.append(i + 1)\n        else:\n            left_boots_by_color[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n        if r_str[i] == '?':\n            right_q_indices.append(i + 1)\n        else:\n            right_boots_by_color[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    result_pairs = []\n\n    # Phase 1: Match specific colors (e.g., 'a' with 'a')\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots_by_color[char] and right_boots_by_color[char]:\n            l_idx = left_boots_by_color[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_boots_by_color[char].pop()\n            result_pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Phase 2: Match remaining specific colors with '?'\n    # Match specific left boots with '?' right boots\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_boots_by_color[char] and right_q_indices:\n            l_idx = left_boots_by_color[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_q_indices.pop()\n            result_pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Match '?' left boots with specific right boots\n    for char_code in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):\n        char = chr(char_code)\n        while left_q_indices and right_boots_by_color[char]:\n            l_idx = left_q_indices.pop()\n            r_idx = right_boots_by_color[char].pop()\n            result_pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Phase 3: Match remaining '?' with '?'\n    while left_q_indices and right_q_indices:\n        l_idx = left_q_indices.pop()\n        r_idx = right_q_indices.pop()\n        result_pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Print results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(result_pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for l_idx, r_idx in result_pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
