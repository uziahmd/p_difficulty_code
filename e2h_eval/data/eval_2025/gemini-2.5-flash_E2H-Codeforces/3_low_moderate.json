Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Vanya and the Lanterns: Devising a Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. The core of it seems fairly straightforward, but getting the minimum radius correct is the tricky part. I need a Python script to handle this, obviously.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. We have a street of length `l`, and `n` lanterns at specific positions `a_i` along that street. Each lantern lights a certain radius `d` around it. My goal is to find the *smallest* value for `d` such that the *entire* street is illuminated. This means every point on the street, from 0 to `l`, needs to be within the lighting radius of at least one lantern.\n\nMy immediate thought is to start by sorting the lantern positions. Order matters, especially when dealing with the gaps between lanterns. If I sort the `a_i` values, I get a clear picture of the layout. From there, I can analyze the unlit segments.\n\nThe beginning of the street is crucial. The first lantern, the one closest to zero, has to cover that initial segment. So, the distance from zero to that first lantern position must be less than or equal to `d`, right? That means `d` has to be at least as large as the position of the first lantern. We could call that `d_1 = a_0`, where `a_0` is the position of the first lantern.\n\nSame logic applies at the end of the street. The last lantern has to reach the end. The distance from the last lantern's position to the end of the street must also be less than or equal to `d`. So, `d` must be at least `l - a_{n-1}`, the difference between the street's length and the last lantern's position. Let's call this `d_2`.\n\nNow, the trick is figuring out how to cover the gaps *between* the lanterns. If two lanterns are next to each other, `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, then there's a space between them that we have to light. The combined light radii have to overlap, or at least meet, in the middle.  For them to meet, their light segments must overlap, meaning the right edge of `a_i`'s light and the left edge of `a_{i+1}`'s light must either coincide or overlap. This leads to the inequality `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. To ensure all gaps are covered, I need the largest of these gap values: `d_3 = max((a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2)`.\n\nSo, to summarize: I have to find `d_1`, the distance from the beginning, `d_2` the distance from the end, and `d_3`, the maximum gap between lanterns.  The absolute minimum radius `d` I need is simply the maximum of these three values: `d = max(d_1, d_2, d_3)`.  That's the core of the strategy. Now it's a matter of translating this into a Python script.\n",
