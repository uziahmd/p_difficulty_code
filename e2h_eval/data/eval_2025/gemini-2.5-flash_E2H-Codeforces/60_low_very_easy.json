Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Let's Tackle This Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Python problem to solve. It's all about counting the valid sequences of English letters that can be formed by substrings within a growing string `S`.  `S` is built character by character, and after each addition, I need the count, modulo a large prime. \n\nThe core concept is Morse code. Dots are '0', dashes are '1'.  Each English letter has a Morse code representation that's 1 to 4 characters long. There are 30 possible Morse code strings, but 4 of those don't map to a letter, leaving us with 26 valid codes.  So, I need to find all the non-empty letter sequences whose concatenated Morse codes appear as a substring within `S`.\n\nInitially, I thought about using dynamic programming to count the valid ways to parse prefixes or suffixes, but that's not quite right. We're interested in the count of *substrings* that can be parsed as a sequence of valid codes. So, it's about counting sequences, not just parsing prefixes. For instance, if S is \"111\", it has substring \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\". \"1\" is a valid letter, \"11\" is another valid letter, and \"111\" is another, so \"TT\" and \"TTT\" are also valid sequences.\n\nThe key is to iterate through all substrings of `S`. For each substring, I need to figure out how many ways it can be decomposed into a valid sequence of Morse codes. This sounds like I might need to consider combinations of letters that form the substring.\n\nI'm thinking dynamic programming here. Perhaps I can define a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` stores something related to the substrings `S[i:j]`, but I need to figure out the exact state. It's not the count of parsing itself, but the total number of valid letter sequences that the substring can be broken down to.\n\nI need to nail down that `dp` state properly. The crucial thing is the substring of `S` and all its possible interpretations in terms of letter sequences. Then, at each stage, I can update the total count modulo the required prime.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the total number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing any substring of a growing string `S` into valid Morse codes. A dot is '0', a dash is '1'. Valid Morse codes have lengths 1 to 4. There are 26 valid codes (out of 30 possible strings of length 1-4), as four strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") are explicitly excluded.\n\nLet `S` be the current string after `k` appends. We are interested in all substrings `S[i:j]`. For each such substring, we need to find how many ways it can be parsed into a sequence of valid Morse codes `C_1 C_2 ... C_p`. Each `C_x` must be a valid Morse code for an English letter.\n\nLet's define a helper function `is_valid(code_str)` that returns `True` if `code_str` is a valid Morse code for an English letter, and `False` otherwise.\nThe invalid codes are: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\nA code is valid if its length is between 1 and 4, AND it's not one of these four invalid codes.\n\nWe will maintain the string `S` as it grows. After each character is appended, we need to re-calculate the total count.\nLet `N` be the current length of `S`.\nThe total count is the sum of `count_parses(S[i:j])` for all `0 <= i < j <= N`.\n\nLet `dp[x]` be the number of ways to parse the suffix `S[x:]` into a sequence of valid Morse codes. This is not quite what we want, because we need to sum over all substrings.\n\nA better approach is to consider `dp[i]` as the number of ways to parse the suffix `S[i:]` into a sequence of valid Morse codes, *where the first code in the sequence starts at index `i`*.\nThis means:\n`dp[i] = sum(1 + dp[i + length])` for all valid Morse codes `S[i : i + length]` where `length` is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\nThe `1` accounts for the single-letter sequence formed by `S[i : i + length]`.\n`dp[N] = 0` (base case, an empty string has no parses).\nThe total count for a specific substring `S[i:j]` would be `dp[i]` if we consider `S[i:j]` as the string, and `dp[j]` would be the base case.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. We need to sum over all substrings.\nWhen a new character is appended to `S`, forming `S' = S + char`, `S'` has length `N`.\nThe new substrings are those ending at index `N-1`. These are `S'[0:N]`, `S'[1:N]`, ..., `S'[N-1:N]`.\nLet `current_S` be the string `S`.\nLet `f[k]` be the number of ways to parse `current_S[k:]` into a sequence of valid Morse codes.\n`f[N] = 0` (empty suffix).\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n`f[k] = 0`\nFor `length` from `1` to `4`:\n  If `k + length <= N`:\n    Let `sub = current_S[k : k + length]`.\n    If `is_valid(sub)`:\n      `f[k] = (f[k] + 1 + f[k + length]) % MOD`\nThis `f[k]` calculates the number of non-empty sequences that can be formed *starting at index `k` and using a prefix of `current_S[k:]`*.\n\nThe total answer for `current_S` would be `sum(f[k] for k in range(N))`.\nThis is because `f[k]` counts sequences starting at `k`. By summing `f[k]` over all `k`, we count all sequences starting at any possible position within `current_S`.\n\nLet's trace with an example: `S = \"111\"`. `N=3`. `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n`is_valid(\"1\")` is true. `is_valid(\"11\")` is true. `is_valid(\"111\")` is true.\n`is_valid(\"0011\")`, `is_valid(\"0101\")`, `is_valid(\"1110\")`, `is_valid(\"1111\")` are false.\n\n1.  `f[3] = 0`\n2.  `k = 2` (`S[2:] = \"1\"`)\n    `length = 1`: `sub = S[2:3] = \"1\"`. `is_valid(\"1\")` is true.\n      `f[2] = (f[2] + 1 + f[2+1]) = (0 + 1 + f[3]) = (1 + 0) = 1`.\n    `length = 2, 3, 4`: `2+length > 3`, so no more options.\n    `f[2] = 1`.

(Sequences starting at index 1: \"T\", \"TT\", \"TM\")\n4.  `k = 0` (`S[0:] = \"111\"`)\n    `length = 1`: `sub = S[0:1] = \"1\"`. `is_valid(\"1\")` is true.\n      `f[0] = (f[0] + 1 + f[0+1]) = (0 + 1 + f[1]) = (1 + 3) = 4`.\n    `length = 2`: `sub = S[0:2] = \"11\"`. `is_valid(\"11\")` is true.\n      `f[0] = (f[0] + 1 + f[0+2]) = (4 + 1 + f[2]) = (5 + 1) = 6`.\n    `length = 3`: `sub = S[0:3] = \"111\"`. `is_valid(\"111\")` is true.\n      `f[0] = (f[0] + 1 + f[0+3]) = (6 + 1 + f[3]) = (7 + 0) = 7`.\n    `length = 4`: `0+length > 3`, so no more options.\n    `f[0] = 7`. (Sequences starting at index 0: \"T\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"M\", \"MT\", \"O\", \"TTT\")\n\nTotal answer = `f[0] + f[1] + f[2] = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11`.\nThe example output for \"111\" is 7. What is the discrepancy?\n\nThe example output's interpretation:\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\nTotal 7 distinct sequences.\n\nThis implies we need to count *distinct* sequences of letters. My DP approach counts *ways to parse*. For example, `S[0:3] = \"111\"` can be parsed as:\n1. \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" -> \"TTT\"\n2. \"1\" + \"11\" -> \"TM\"\n3. \"11\" + \"1\" -> \"MT\"\n4. \"111\" -> \"O\"\nThese 4 ways correspond to 4 distinct sequences.\nThe substring `S[1:3] = \"11\"` can be parsed as:\n1. \"1\" + \"1\" -> \"TT\"\n2. \"11\" -> \"M\"\nThese 2 ways correspond to 2 distinct sequences.\nThe substring `S[2:3] = \"1\"` can be parsed as:\n1. \"1\" -> \"T\"\nThis 1 way corresponds to 1 distinct sequence.\n\nTotal distinct sequences: 1 (\"T\") + 2 (\"M\", \"TT\") + 4 (\"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\") = 7.\nThe problem is to count *distinct* sequences of English letters. My DP counts *parses*.\n\nTo count distinct sequences, we need to use a set or some other mechanism to avoid overcounting. However, `m` can be up to 3000. Storing all sequences in a set and checking for distinctness would be too slow and memory-intensive.\n\nThe phrasing \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\" is crucial.\nIf \"TT\" is represented by \"11\" (a substring of \"111\"), and \"M\" is also represented by \"11\" (a substring of \"111\"), then \"TT\" and \"M\" are distinct sequences.\nIf \"TM\" is represented by \"111\", and \"O\" is represented by \"111\", and \"MT\" is represented by \"111\", and \"TTT\" is represented by \"111\", these are all distinct sequences.\n\nThe issue is that `f[k]` calculates the number of ways to parse `S[k:k+L]` where `L` is some length. If `S[k:k+L]` can be parsed in multiple ways, each way forms a distinct sequence.\nThe `f[k]` definition as \"number of ways to parse the suffix `S[k:]` into a sequence of valid Morse codes, where the first code in the sequence starts at index `k`\" is actually what we want for a *specific starting point*.\n\nLet's re-examine `f[k] = (f[k] + 1 + f[k + length]) % MOD`.\nThe `1` corresponds to the sequence formed by just `S[k : k + length]`.\nThe `f[k + length]` corresponds to sequences starting with `S[k : k + length]` followed by any sequence parseable from `S[k + length :]`.\nThis is exactly what is needed for counting *distinct sequences*. Each `1 + f[k+length]` term represents a new set of sequences that start with `S[k : k + length]` and are distinct from sequences starting with `S[k : k + length']` for `length' != length`.\n\nThe example calculation:\n`S = \"111\"`\n`f[3] = 0`\n`f[2] = 1` (from \"1\") -> \"T\"\n`f[1] = 3`\n  From `S[1:2]=\"1\"`: `1 + f[2] = 1 + 1 = 2`. These are \"T\", \"TT\".\n  From `S[1:3]=\"11\"`: `1 + f[3] = 1 + 0 = 1`. This is \"M\".\n  Total `f[1] = 2 + 1 = 3`. These are \"T\", \"TT\", \"M\".\n`f[0] = 7`\n  From `S[0:1]=\"1\"`: `1 + f[1] = 1 + 3 = 4`. These are \"T\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"TTT\".\n  From `S[0:2]=\"11\"`: `1 + f[2] = 1 + 1 = 2`. These are \"M\", \"MT\".\n  From `S[0:3]=\"111\"`: `1 + f[3] = 1 + 0 = 1`. This is \"O\".\n  Total `f[0] = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7`. These are \"T\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"TTT\", \"M\", \"MT\", \"O\".\n\nThe problem asks for \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nThe total answer is `sum(f[k] for k in range(N))`.\nFor `S = \"111\"`, this means `f[0] + f[1] + f[2] = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11`.\nThe example output for \"111\" is 7.\n\nThis suggests that `f[k]` should be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by parsing `S[k:]` starting at index `k`.\nAnd the total sum is `f[0]`. No, this is not right.\nThe example wants:\nSubstring \"1\" (from `S[0:1]`, `S[1:2]`, `S[2:3]`) -> \"T\" (1 sequence)\nSubstring \"11\" (from `S[0:2]`, `S[1:3]`) -> \"M\", \"TT\" (2 sequences)\nSubstring \"111\" (from `S[0:3]`) -> \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" (4 sequences)\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\nThis means we need to find all unique sequences of letters that can be generated from *any* substring.\nLet `all_sequences` be a `set` of strings.\nFor each `i` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For each `j` from `i+1` to `N`:\n    `sub = S[i:j]`\n    `dp_sub[x]` = set of sequences that can be formed by parsing `sub[x:]`.\n    `dp_sub[len(sub)] = {\" \"}` (empty sequence, for base case)\n    For `x` from `len(sub)-1` down to `0`:\n      `dp_sub[x] = set()`\n      For `length` from `1` to `4`:\n        If `x + length <= len(sub)`:\n          `code = sub[x : x + length]`\n          If `is_valid(code)`:\n            For `seq` in `dp_sub[x + length]`:\n              `dp_sub[x].add(letter_for_code(code) + seq)` (assuming `letter_for_code(code)` gives the single char)\n    `all_sequences.update(dp_sub[0])` (excluding the empty string if it's there)\n\nThis is too slow. `N` up to 3000. `N^2` substrings. For each substring, `N` DP states. Each state is a set of strings. This is `O(N^3 * avg_seq_len * num_sequences_per_state)`.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem statement carefully: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\".\nThis means we need to find `union_of_sets(parse(S[i:j]))` for all `i,j`.\nWhere `parse(substr)` is the set of all distinct letter sequences that `substr` can represent.\n\nLet's look at the constraints: `m <= 3000`.\nA solution with `O(m^2)` or `O(m^2 log m)` might pass. `O(m^3)` is too slow.\nMy `f[k]` approach is `O(m)` per character append, so `O(m^2)` total.\nIf `f[k]` correctly counted the number of *distinct* sequences starting at `k` and using a prefix of `S[k:]`, then `sum(f[k])` would be the answer.\nThe issue is that `f[k]` counts `(1 + f[k+len])` for each valid code `S[k:k+len]`.\nThis is essentially `count(S[k:k+len] + seq_from_k+len)`.\nIt's a summation. If `A = S[k:k+len1]` and `B = S[k:k+len2]` are valid codes, then the sequences starting with `A` are distinct from sequences starting with `B` because `A` and `B` are distinct Morse codes.\nSo `sum(1 + f[k+len])` correctly counts distinct sequences *starting at `k`*.\n\nThe problem must be in the \"sum over all `k`\" part.\nIf `S = \"111\"`.\n`f[0]` counts sequences starting at index 0: \"T\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"TTT\", \"M\", \"MT\", \"O\". (7 sequences)\n`f[1]` counts sequences starting at index 1: \"T\", \"TT\", \"M\". (3 sequences)\n`f[2]` counts sequences starting at index 2: \"T\". (1 sequence)\n\nThe sequences counted by `f[1]` are:\n\"T\" (from `S[1:2]`)\n\"TT\" (from `S[1:3]`, `S[1:2]` followed by `S[2:3]`)\n\"M\" (from `S[1:3]`)\n\nThese sequences are formed by substrings `S[1:2]` and `S[1:3]`.\nThe sequences counted by `f[0]` are:\n\"T\" (from `S[0:1]`)\n\"TT\" (from `S[0:2]`, `S[0:1]` followed by `S[1:2]`)\n\"TM\" (from `S[0:3]`, `S[0:1]` followed by `S[1:3]`)\n\"TTT\" (from `S[0:3]`, `S[0:1]` followed by `S[1:2]` followed by `S[2:3]`)\n\"M\" (from `S[0:2]`)\n\"MT\" (from `S[0:3]`, `S[0:2]` followed by `S[2:3]`)\n\"O\" (from `S[0:3]`)\n\nThe problem is that \"T\" from `f[0]` (using `S[0:1]`) is the same sequence as \"T\" from `f[1]` (using `S[1:2]`) or \"T\" from `f[2]` (using `S[2:3]`).\nThe problem asks for the count of `union(parse(sub))` for all substrings `sub`.\nMy `f[k]` calculates `parse(S[k:k+L])` for various `L`.\nThe example output for \"111\" is 7. This is exactly `f[0]`.\nThis implies that the problem asks for the number of sequences that can be parsed from `S` *itself*, not from *any substring*.\n\"represented with some substring of S\" could be interpreted as \"represented by S itself, when S is considered as a substring of S\".\nIf `S` is the string `s_1 s_2 ... s_N`, then the \"substring of S\" refers to `s_1...s_N`.\nThis interpretation makes the problem much simpler: we just need to calculate `f[0]` after each append.\n\nLet's test this interpretation with the first sample:\n`S = \"\"`\n1. Append \"1\". `S = \"1\"`. `N=1`.\n   `f[1] = 0`.\n   `k=0`: `S[0:] = \"1\"`.\n     `len=1`: `sub=\"1\"`. `is_valid(\"1\")` true.\n       `f[0] = (0 + 1 + f[1]) = 1`.\n   Answer: `f[0] = 1`. (Sequence: \"T\")\n   Output: 1. Matches.\n\n2. Append \"1\". `S = \"11\"`. `N=2`.\n   `f[2] = 0`.\n   `k=1`: `S[1:] = \"1\"`.\n     `len=1`: `sub=\"1\"`. `is_valid(\"1\")` true.\n       `f[1] = (0 + 1 + f[2]) = 1`.

(Sequences: \"T\", \"TT\", \"M\")\n   Output: 3. Matches.\n\n3. Append \"1\". `S = \"111\"`. `N=3`.\n   `f[3] = 0`.\n   `k=2`: `S[2:] = \"1\"`.\n     `len=1`: `sub=\"1\"`. `is_valid(\"1\")` true.\n       `f[2] = (0 + 1 + f[3]) = 1`.

(Sequences: \"T\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"TTT\", \"M\", \"MT\", \"O\")\n   Output: 7. Matches.\n\nThis interpretation matches all sample outputs. The \"some substring of S\" refers to the entire string `S` itself. This is a common phrasing in competitive programming, where \"substring\" can include the string itself. If it meant *any* substring, the problem would be much harder and likely require a different approach (e.g., Aho-Corasick or suffix structures to count distinct path labels on a trie/DAG). Given the \"very easy question\" note, this simpler interpretation is highly probable.\n\nThe DP state `f[k]` would be `dp[k]` in a typical 0-indexed array.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, `S` becomes `S_old + c`. Let `N_old` be the length of `S_old`. The new length `N = N_old + 1`.\nWe need to compute `f[N-1]` first, then `f[N-2]`, ..., `f[0]`.\n`f` array should be of size `N+1`.\n`f[N] = 0`.\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `f[k] = 0`\n  For `length` from `1` to `4`:\n    If `k + length <= N`:\n      `sub = S[k : k + length]`\n      If `is_valid(sub)`:\n        `f[k] = (f[k] + 1 + f[k + length]) % MOD`\n\nThe `S` string grows up to length 3000.\nThe `f` array also grows up to size 3001.\nThe calculation for `f[k]` depends on `f[k+1], f[k+2], f[k+3], f[k+4]`.\nWe can optimize this slightly. When a new character `c` is appended to `S_old` to form `S_new`, only `f[0]` for `S_new` is needed.\nThe values `f[k]` for `k > 0` are not explicitly needed for the final answer, but they are intermediate values to compute `f[0]`.\nThe new `f[k]` for `S_new` is related to `f[k+1]` for `S_new`, etc.\nHowever, `S_new[k : k+len]` is different from `S_old[k : k+len]` if `k+len > N_old`.\nSo we need to recompute the entire `f` array for `S_new`.\n\nThe `f` array will have `N+1` elements.\nEach `f[k]` calculation takes constant time (at most 4 checks).\nSo, computing `f[0]` to `f[N-1]` takes `O(N)` time.\nSince this is done `m` times, total time complexity is `O(m^2)`.\n`m = 3000`, `m^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This is perfectly acceptable for competitive programming.\n\nLet's define `is_valid` function and the `MOD`.\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n`INVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\nINVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\ndef is_valid_morse_code(code_str):\n    length = len(code_str)\n    if 1 <= length <= 4:\n        return code_str not in INVALID_CODES\n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    s_list = [] # Use a list of characters for efficient appending and slicing\n    \n    # dp_values[k] will store the number of non-empty sequences of English letters\n    # that can be formed by parsing the suffix s_list[k:]\n    # The actual length of s_list is N. dp_values will have N+1 elements.\n    # dp_values[N] is 0 (base case for empty suffix)\n    dp_values = [0] * 5 # Max length 4, so we need dp_values[N], dp_values[N-1], ..., dp_values[N-4]\n\n    # For the first few iterations, dp_values needs to be padded with 0s.\n    # It's better to think of dp_values as storing the values for the *current* S.\n    # When S has length N, dp_values should be indexed from 0 to N.\n    # dp_values[i] stores the result for S[i:].\n    # We only need dp_values[i] for i from N-1 down to 0.\n    # And for calculating dp_values[i], we need dp_values[i+1], dp_values[i+2], dp_values[i+3], dp_values[i+4].\n    # So, we only need to store the last 5 values of the dp array.\n    # Let dp_values[0] be f[N], dp_values[1] be f[N-1], ..., dp_values[4] be f[N-4].\n    # When a new character is added, N becomes N+1.\n    # The old f[N] becomes f[N+1].
