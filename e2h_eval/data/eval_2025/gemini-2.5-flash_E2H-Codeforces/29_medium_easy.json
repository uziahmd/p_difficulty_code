            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Substitutes in Number\n\nAndrew and Eugene are playing a game. Initially, Andrew has string s, consisting of digits. Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Simulating String Replacements and Modulo Calculation**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to simulate string replacements and then find the final numerical value modulo 10^9 + 7.  The key insight here is that naively performing the replacements is a dead end – the string lengths can blow up exponentially. We need a way to track the *effect* of these replacements without actually building the potentially massive strings.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n1.  **Represent Digits with Value and Length**: Instead of the string, I'll associate each digit (0-9) with two key values: `val[digit]` (the final numerical value of the string that this digit eventually transforms into, modulo 10^9 + 7) and `len[digit]` (the length of that final string, modulo 10^9 + 6, using Fermat's Little Theorem to handle the exponents). Initially, each digit represents itself, so `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1`.\n\n2.  **Process Queries in Reverse**: The crucial part is to process the replacement queries *in reverse order*.  Consider a query `d -> t`. When processing this, I need to know what `t` \"becomes\" after all previous queries are applied. But because I'm going backward, `val` and `len` already represent the fully transformed values for digits within `t`.  So, for each query, update the `val` and `len` for the replaced digit `d` using the final digit values that `t` is composed of.\n\n3.  **Updating `val` and `len`**: To update the values for the replacement:\n\n    *   Initialize: `new_val[d] = 0`, `new_len[d] = 0`\n    *   Iterate through replacement string `t` from right to left (least to most significant): Let each character be a `digit_t`.\n    *   Update values: The new value for `d` becomes: `(new_val[d] + val[digit_t] * pow(10, new_len[d], MOD)) % MOD`. The value of the string at that position `new_len_d` gets shifted left (`pow(10, position)`).\n    *   Update lengths: `new_len[d] = (new_len[d] + len[digit_t]) % MOD_EXP`. The length accumulates modulo `MOD_EXP` to avoid overflow.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation on Initial String**: After processing all queries, I iterate through the *initial* string `s` from right to left:\n    *   Take each digit `d` from string `s`, and then replace it with its final numerical value.\n    *   Use the stored `val[d]` and a power of 10 based on the current length `len[d]` to calculate the final value.\n\n5.  **Modular Arithmetic**: Throughout the process, I perform all calculations modulo 10^9 + 7 (`MOD`) to prevent integer overflow.  When calculating the power of 10, use modular exponentiation `pow(10, exponent, MOD)` for efficiency.\n\n6.  **Edge Cases** This approach naturally handles leading zeros and empty string `s` scenarios correctly.\n\n**Time Complexity**: This is efficient! The initial setup is constant time (`O(10)`). The time complexity is dominated by the query processing, which takes `O((|s| + sum of all lengths of strings in queries) * log(MOD))`. The most expensive step is calculating the powers.\n\nThis method avoids string concatenation and maintains a modular state that allows us to calculate the value without dealing with the actual potentially huge strings that are generated by successive replacement rules.\n",
