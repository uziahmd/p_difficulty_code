Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the String Replacement Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem and it's all about string manipulation and modular arithmetic. Essentially, I start with a string of digits, \"s,\" and I have a series of replacement queries, \"n.\" Each query swaps a digit with a string. The challenge is, after all the replacements, I need to treat the resulting number (potentially *huge*) as a decimal and find its value modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nThe immediate problem is that directly simulating these string replacements will be a nightmare. Strings will grow exponentially in size which is a terrible approach. I can't just keep building these monstrous strings; that will blow both time and memory.\n\nHere's the key: I need to focus on *what* happens to the original digits. If I have an original digit `d`, and a query comes along that replaces it, great; but that replacement string itself can contain other digits that will also be transformed by *future* queries.  This leads me to think about tracking the *value* of where the digit goes.\n\nTherefore, the approach I am considering is dynamic programming or working backwards; I need a clever way to avoid explicitly building that giant string. I need to define the concept of value and length for the resulting value of a single digit!\n\nSo, let's establish some ground rules. Let's create an array `val[d]` which will hold the final numerical value of the digit *after* all replacements. Also, I need an array `len[d]` that stores the final *length* of that digit string, after replacements. The length is important because it dictates the powers of 10 for each place value.\n\nFor an original digit `d`, when a query replaces it with the string \"t,\" that `t` is comprised of other digits that themselves transform. It means I have to recursively calculate the value and the length for the characters of \"t.\"\n\nEssentially, for a final string \"t = c_k c_{k-1} ... c_1 c_0,\" the value will become `c_k * 10^(L_{k-1} + ... + L_0) + V_{k-1} * 10^(L_{k-2} + ... + L_0) + ... + V_1 * 10^(L_0) + V_0`. \nThis gives rise to a neat recursive definition that can hopefully be memoized and work for any string \"t\".\n\nThis looks promising. I think I'm on the right track here, establishing `current_val[d]` and `current_len[d]` for each digit `d` will be key. Time to get coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of string replacements and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 10^9 + 7. The string can become extremely long, so direct simulation is not feasible. We need a way to calculate the value and length without explicitly constructing the string.\n\nLet `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\nLet `MOD_EXP = 10^9 + 6` (which is `MOD - 1`). This is used for exponents in modular arithmetic by Fermat's Little Theorem: `a^b % P = a^(b % (P-1)) % P` for prime `P` and `a` not a multiple of `P`.\n\nWe observe that the queries are processed sequentially. A query `di -> ti` replaces `di` with `ti`. Any digits within `ti` might themselves be replaced by subsequent queries. This suggests processing the queries in reverse order.\n\nLet's maintain `current_val[d]` and `current_len[d]` for each digit `d` from 0 to 9.\n*   `current_val[d]` will store the numerical value (modulo `MOD`) that a single digit `d` eventually transforms into after all *remaining* queries are applied to it.\n*   `current_len[d]` will store the length (modulo `MOD_EXP`) that a single digit `d` eventually transforms into after all *remaining* queries are applied to it. This length is used for calculating powers of 10.\n\nInitially, before any queries, a digit `d` transforms into itself:\n*   `current_val[d] = d`\n*   `current_len[d] = 1`\n\nNow, we process the queries from the last one to the first one. When we process query `k`: `di -> ti`:\nThis query tells us how `di` transforms. For any other digit `j != di`, its `current_val[j]` and `current_len[j]` remain unchanged by this specific query `k`, because query `k` doesn't affect `j`.\nFor `di`, its new transformation `ti` can be computed using the `current_val` and `current_len` values that are *already updated for all queries from `k+1` to `n-1`*.\n\nLet `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\nWe iterate through the characters `c` in `ti` from left to right.\nFor each character `c` (which is a digit `int(c)`):\n*   `new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, current_len[int(c)], MOD) + current_val[int(c)]) % MOD`\n*   `new_len_di = (new_len_di + current_len[int(c)]) % MOD_EXP`\n\nAfter processing all characters in `ti`, we update:\n*   `current_val[int(di)] = new_val_di`\n*   `current_len[int(di)] = new_len_di`\n\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `current_val[d]` and `current_len[d]` will hold the final value and length for each digit `d` from the original string `s`.\n\nFinally, we calculate the result for the initial string `s`.\nLet `final_result = 0` and `total_length = 0`.\nWe iterate through the characters `c` in the initial string `s` from left to right:\n*   `final_result = (final_result * pow(10, current_len[int(c)], MOD) + current_val[int(c)]) % MOD`\n*   `total_length = (total_length + current_len[int(c)]) % MOD_EXP`\n\nThe `total_length` is not strictly needed for the final answer, but it's illustrative of how lengths combine. The `final_result` is the answer.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Sample 3):**\n`s = \"222\"`\n`n = 2`\n`2->0`\n`0->7`\n\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`, `MOD_EXP = 10^9 + 6`\n\n**Initial state (before any queries):**\n`current_val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`current_len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Query 2 (last query): `0->7`**\n`di = '0'`, `ti = \"7\"`\n`new_val_0 = 0`, `new_len_0 = 0`\nIterate `c` in `ti` (\"7\"):\n  `c = '7'`:\n    `new_val_0 = (0 * pow(10, current_len[7], MOD) + current_val[7]) % MOD`\n    `new_val_0 = (0 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = 7`\n    `new_len_0 = (0 + current_len[7]) % MOD_EXP = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 1`\nUpdate:\n`current_val[0] = 7`\n`current_len[0] = 1`\nState after query 2:\n`current_val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`current_len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Query 1 (first query): `2->0`**\n`di = '2'`, `ti = \"0\"`\n`new_val_2 = 0`, `new_len_2 = 0`\nIterate `c` in `ti` (\"0\"):\n  `c = '0'`:\n    `new_val_2 = (0 * pow(10, current_len[0], MOD) + current_val[0]) % MOD`\n    `new_val_2 = (0 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = 7` (Note: `current_val[0]` is now 7)\n    `new_len_2 = (0 + current_len[0]) % MOD_EXP = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXP = 1`\nUpdate:\n`current_val[2] = 7`\n`current_len[2] = 1`\nState after query 1 (final state for digits):\n`current_val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`current_len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Process initial string `s = \"222\"`:**\n`final_result = 0`\n`c = '2'`:\n  `final_result = (0 * pow(10, current_len[2], MOD) + current_val[2]) % MOD`\n  `final_result = (0 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = 7`\n`c = '2'`:\n  `final_result = (7 * pow(10, current_len[2], MOD) + current_val[2]) % MOD`\n  `final_result = (7 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = (70 + 7) % MOD = 77`\n`c = '2'`:\n  `final_result = (77 * pow(10, current_len[2], MOD) + current_val[2]) % MOD`\n  `final_result = (77 * 10^1 + 7) % MOD = (770 + 7) % MOD = 777`\n\nFinal answer: `777`. This matches the sample output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Initialization: O(10)\n*   Processing queries: `n` queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate `|ti|` characters. Each character involves a `pow` operation (logarithmic time) and a few arithmetic operations. The sum of `|ti|` is `SUM_TI <= 10^5`. So, total time for queries is `O(SUM_TI * log(MOD))`.\n*   Processing initial string `s`: `|s|` characters. Each character involves a `pow` operation and arithmetic. Total time is `O(|s| * log(MOD))`.\n\nOverall time complexity: `O((|s| + SUM_TI) * log(MOD))`.\nGiven `|s| <= 10^5` and `SUM_TI <= 10^5`, this is roughly `2 * 10^5 * log(10^9)`. `log(10^9)` is about 30 for base 2. So `2 * 10^5 * 30 = 6 * 10^6` operations, which is efficient enough.\nSpace complexity: `O(1)` for `current_val` and `current_len` arrays, plus `O(n + |s| + SUM_TI)` for storing input queries and initial string.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        parts = line.split(\"->\")\n        d_i = parts[0]\n        t_i = parts[1]\n        queries.append((d_i, t_i))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_EXP = 1000000006 # For exponents in pow(base, exp, MOD)\n\n    # current_val[d] stores the numerical value (mod MOD) that digit d transforms into\n    # current_len[d] stores the length (mod MOD_EXP) that digit d transforms into\n    # Initialize: a digit d transforms into itself, length 1\n    current_val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    current_len = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        d_i, t_i = queries[i]\n        digit_to_replace = int(d_i)\n\n        new_val_for_di = 0\n        new_len_for_di = 0\n\n        # If t_i is empty, it means the digit disappears\n        if not t_i:\n            current_val[digit_to_replace] = 0\n            current_len[digit_to_replace] = 0\n            continue\n        \n        # Calculate the new value and length for digit_to_replace\n        # based on the current transformations of digits within t_i\n        for char_in_ti in t_i:\n            d = int(char_in_ti)\n            \n            # The value of the string is (previous_value * 10^len_of_current_digit_block + value_of_current_digit_block) % MOD\n            # The length is (previous_length + len_of_current_digit_block) % MOD_EXP\n            \n            # Calculate 10^(current_len[d]) % MOD\n            power_of_10 = pow(10, current_len[d], MOD)\n            \n            new_val_for_di = (new_val_for_di * power_of_10 + current_val[d]) % MOD\n            new_len_for_di = (new_len_for_di + current_len[d]) % MOD_EXP\n        \n        current_val[digit_to_replace] = new_val_for_di\n        current_len[digit_to_replace] = new_len_for_di\n\n    # After processing all queries, calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_result = 0\n    # total_length_of_s = 0 # Not strictly needed for the final answer, but for understanding\n    \n    for char_s in s:\n        d = int(char_s)\n        \n        # Calculate 10^(current_len[d]) % MOD\n        power_of_10 = pow(10, current_len[d], MOD)\n        \n        final_result = (final_result * power_of_10 + current_val[d]) % MOD\n        # total_length_of_s = (total_length_of_s + current_len[d]) % MOD_EXP\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_result) + \"\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
