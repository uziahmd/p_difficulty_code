You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown: Finding Odd Cycles in an Undirected Graph**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of edges, `t`, needed to turn a given undirected graph into one that has a simple odd-length cycle, and also the number of ways, `w`, to achieve this. The graph has no loops and no parallel edges, so that simplifies things.\n\nMy first thought is to see if the graph already *has* an odd cycle. If it does, great! Then `t` is zero, and `w` is simply 1 because we only care that *a* cycle exists, not all of them. I can check for this using the well-known property: a graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it's not bipartite.\n\nTo check for bipartiteness, I'll run BFS or DFS. I'll start from an unvisited vertex, assign it a color (say, 0). Then, all its neighbors get the opposite color (1). I'll continue this coloring process. If I ever hit an edge where both ends have the same color, boom, it's not bipartite, and I already have an odd cycle!\n\nIf that check shows the graph *is* bipartite, then `t` must be at least 1. Bipartite graphs have vertices split into two sets (U and V) where edges only connect a vertex in U to a vertex in V. To create an odd cycle, I *must* add an edge between two vertices *within the same set* (either U-U or V-V). Adding an edge between vertices in *different* sets (U-V) always results in an even cycle because paths between sets are odd length, adding an edge would create an even cycle (odd + 1 = even).\n\nSo, if it's bipartite, `t` will be 1. The challenge then becomes counting how many such edges I *can* add, the `w`. This boils down to figuring out the bipartition for each connected component. I'll use the coloring information from my bipartiteness check: `color[v] = 0` or `1`. Then, I need to count how many pairs of vertices within the same color group are *not* already connected. This will give me `w`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w` the number of ways to do so.\n\nA graph contains an odd cycle if and only if it is not bipartite. This is the key property we will use.\n\nWe can analyze the problem in three main cases:\n\n**Case 0: The graph already contains an odd cycle.**\nIf the given graph is not bipartite, it already contains an odd cycle. In this case, no edges need to be added, so `t = 0`. The number of ways `w` is 1, as an odd cycle already exists.\n\n**Case 1: The graph is bipartite, and we can form an odd cycle by adding one edge.**\nIf the graph is bipartite, we need to add at least one edge. An odd cycle can be formed by adding a single edge if and only if there exist two vertices `u` and `v` such that:\n1. `u` and `v` belong to the same connected component.\n2. `u` and `v` are in the same partition of that component (i.e., they have the same \"color\" in a 2-coloring).\n3. `u` and `v` are not already connected by an edge.\n\nIf such a pair `(u, v)` exists, adding an edge `(u, v)` will create an odd cycle. The path between `u` and `v` in the original bipartite graph (within the same component) must have an even length. Adding the edge `(u, v)` forms a cycle of length (even_path_length + 1), which is odd.\nIn this case, `t = 1`. We need to count the number of ways `w`.\n`w` is the number of pairs `(u, v)` such that `u` and `v` are in the same partition of the same connected component, and `(u, v)` is not an existing edge.\nLet `N_0` be the count of vertices in partition 0 and `N_1` be the count of vertices in partition 1 for a connected component. The number of potential edges within partition 0 is `N_0 * (N_0 - 1) / 2`. Similarly for partition 1, `N_1 * (N_1 - 1) / 2`. We sum these up for all connected components. Then, we subtract the number of existing edges that connect two vertices within the same partition (which is 0 in a bipartite graph, but it's good to be careful if the graph was not bipartite). Since we know the graph is bipartite, all existing edges connect vertices from different partitions. So, `w = sum(N_0 * (N_0 - 1) / 2 + N_1 * (N_1 - 1) / 2)` over all connected components.\n\n**Case 2: The graph is bipartite, and we cannot form an odd cycle by adding one edge.**\nThis situation occurs if and only if the graph consists of only isolated vertices or isolated edges. More precisely, if every connected component has at most 2 vertices.\nIf a component has 1 vertex (`N_0=1, N_1=0`), `N_0*(N_0-1)/2 + N_1*(N_1-1)/2 = 0`.\nIf a component has 2 vertices (`N_0=1, N_1=1`), `N_0*(N_0-1)/2 + N_1*(N_1-1)/2 = 0`.\nIn such a graph, any two vertices `u, v` that are in the same partition must necessarily be in different connected components (unless `N_0` or `N_1` is 0, meaning only 1 vertex in component). If they are in different components, adding an edge `(u, v)` does not create an odd cycle by itself, it just merges two components. To form an odd cycle, we need at least 3 vertices in the cycle.\nIf all components are of size 1 or 2, we need to add more than one edge.\nThe minimum number of edges to add will be 3. We need to pick three distinct vertices `u, v, x` and add edges `(u, v), (v, x), (x, u)`. This forms a triangle, which is an odd cycle of length 3.\nIn this case, `t = 3`.\nThe number of ways `w` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6`, which is the number of ways to choose 3 distinct vertices out of `n`, as any such choice forms a triangle. We must ensure these edges are not already present. Since the graph only has isolated vertices or edges, and we are choosing 3 vertices, it's guaranteed that at least one of these edges (in fact, all three) will be new if the graph is sparse enough. If `n < 3`, this case is impossible. If `n >= 3`, we can always form a triangle.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialize:** `colors` array (e.g., -1 for unvisited), `visited` array (optional, but good for BFS/DFS), `adj` list for graph.\n2.  **Bipartite Check and Component Processing:**\n    Iterate through all vertices `i` from 1 to `n`. If `i` is not yet visited:\n    *   Start a BFS/DFS from `i` to find a connected component.\n    *   Maintain `N_0` and `N_1` (counts of vertices in partition 0 and 1) for the current component.\n    *   Assign `color[i] = 0`. Add `i` to a queue/stack.\n    *   During traversal:\n        *   If an edge `(u, v)` is found where `color[u] == color[v]`, then the graph is **not bipartite**. Set a flag `is_bipartite = False` and break out of all loops. We are in Case 0.\n        *   If `v` is uncolored, assign `color[v] = 1 - color[u]` and add `v` to queue/stack. Update `N_0` or `N_1`.\n        *   If `v` is colored and `color[v] != 1 - color[u]`, it's a conflict, graph is not bipartite.\n    *   If the component is successfully 2-colored (no conflicts), store `(N_0, N_1)` for this component.\n3.  **Determine `t` and `w`:**\n\n    *   **If `is_bipartite == False` (Case 0):**\n        `t = 0`, `w = 1`. Print `0 1`.\n    *   **If `is_bipartite == True`:**\n        Calculate `total_ways_one_edge = 0`.\n        `has_component_size_gt_2 = False`.\n        For each component `(N_0, N_1)`:\n            If `N_0 > 1`: `total_ways_one_edge += N_0 * (N_0 - 1) // 2`.\n            If `N_1 > 1`: `total_ways_one_edge += N_1 * (N_1 - 1) // 2`.\n            If `N_0 + N_1 > 2`: `has_component_size_gt_2 = True`.\n        \n        *   **If `total_ways_one_edge > 0` (Case 1):**\n            This means there's at least one component with `N_0 > 1` or `N_1 > 1`, allowing an edge to be added within a partition.\n            `t = 1`, `w = total_ways_one_edge`. Print `1` and `total_ways_one_edge`.\n        *   **If `total_ways_one_edge == 0` (Case 2):**\n            This implies all components are of size 1 or 2.\n            `t = 3`.\n            `w = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. (Number of ways to choose 3 vertices for a triangle).\n            Print `3` and `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.\n\n**Example Walkthroughs:**\n\n*   **Input 1:** `4 4`, `1 2`, `1 3`, `4 2`, `4 3`\n    *   Graph: 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3. This forms a C4 (cycle of length 4), which is bipartite.\n    *   BFS/DFS:\n        *   Start at 1, color[1]=0.\n        *   Neighbors of 1: 2, 3. Color[2]=1, Color[3]=1.\n        *   Neighbors of 2: 1 (color[1]=0, ok), 4. Color[4]=0.\n        *   Neighbors of 3: 1 (color[1]=0, ok), 4.

(Possible edges: (1,4) or (2,3)).\n\n*   **Input 2:** `3 3`, `1 2`, `2 3`, `3 1`\n    *   Graph: 1-2, 2-3, 3-1.
