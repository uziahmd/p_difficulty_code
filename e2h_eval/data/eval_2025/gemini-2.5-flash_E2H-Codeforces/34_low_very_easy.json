And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing Sleep Time Calculations**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I need to write a Python script, and the core of it will be calculating the average sleep time across all possible 'k'-day weeks from a given dataset.  Essentially, I'm given the total number of days (`n`), the week length (`k`), and an array of sleep times (`a`). My objective is to find the average sleep time over these sliding windows of `k` days.\n\nIt looks like the problem is fairly well-defined: I have a starting point and an endpoint, and then a well-defined way to iterate. I need to sum the sleep times within each window (week) and then calculate an average. I know there are `n - k + 1` such weeks.\n\nInitially, I considered a straightforward nested-loop approach.  The outer loop iterates through the weeks, and the inner loop calculates the sum for each week. However, the constraints (specifically, the upper bounds for `n` and `k`) indicate that a naive `O(n*k)` solution would be too slow. It's really pushing the limits of acceptable time complexity, given that `n` and `k` can be as large as 2 * 10^5.  At these values, `n*k` is incredibly slow.\n\nTherefore, I need to find a more efficient solution.  This is screaming \"sliding window\" or \"prefix sum\" at me. It's a textbook application.  Let's look at prefix sums.  If I can pre-compute the cumulative sums of the array `a`, then I can calculate the sum of any window in constant time. Given that P[i] is the sum from a_1 to a_i, the sum of any window can be calculated as the difference between two prefix sums.  For a window from index x to index x+k-1 the result is P[x+k-1] - P[x-1].\n\nThis way, I can avoid the nested loops and get the weekly sums in O(n) or close to it, and my time complexity should come down to O(n), assuming it takes time O(n) to compute the prefix sums. I think prefix sums is my approach. I'll need to calculate prefix sums, then loop through and calculate each week from these, and then compute the average. This feels like the right direction.\n",
