He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Prefixes and Suffixes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem, and here's my understanding so far. We're given a bunch of strings – specifically, `2n-2` of them – and they're all partial prefixes and suffixes of some hidden string `s` of length `n`.  The game is to figure out which of those input strings is a prefix (P) and which is a suffix (S), and then output a string of \"P\"s and \"S\"s to represent that.\n\nThe key insight, as I see it, is that for each length *k* from 1 up to *n-1*, we're guaranteed to have exactly *two* strings in the input. One has to be the prefix of that length, and the other has to be the suffix.  This length aspect is super important for organization.\n\nI'm thinking that if I can pinpoint the prefixes, I can actually reconstruct the original string `s`.  Specifically, the prefix of length `n-1` (let's call it `P_{n-1}`) is essentially `s` with the last character chopped off. Similarly, the suffix of length `n-1` (`S_{n-1}`) is `s` with the first character missing.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting.  Since `P_{n-1}` is almost the whole string, and `S_{n-1}` is also almost the whole string, I can use them to figure out the last character. The complete string `s` can be formed by concatenating `P_{n-1}` with the first character of the only suffix of length 1, or by concatenating the first character of the only prefix of length 1 with `S_{n-1}`.  Either way should work, and this will be my approach.\n\nBasically, I need to find the `P_{n-1}` and `S_{n-1}` strings. Their overlap is the crucial piece: the middle part of `P_{n-1}` (excluding the first character) must be the same as the beginning part of `S_{n-1}` (excluding the last character). That overlap allows reconstruction of the original string. I can identify `s`, and work backwards.\n\nTherefore, the core of my strategy will be to use length to pair prefix and suffix candidates. Then compare these candidates of length `n-1` looking for the required overlap. And finally, I will create the output string of \"P\"s and \"S\"s based on the identified prefix and suffix strings. I will need to be careful about constructing the output because a simple brute force on the order would not be efficient.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify `2n-2` given strings as prefixes ('P') or suffixes ('S') of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that for each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings of length `k` in the input. One of these is the prefix of length `k`, and the other is the suffix of length `k`.\n\nLet `P_k` denote the prefix of length `k` and `S_k` denote the suffix of length `k` of the string `s`.\nIf `s = c_0 c_1 ... c_{n-1}`, then:\n*   `P_k = c_0 c_1 ... c_{k-1}`\n*   `S_k = c_{n-k} c_{n-k+1} ... c_{n-1}`\n\nThe key observation is that the string `s` can be uniquely determined from `P_{n-1}` and `S_1`, or from `P_1` and `S_{n-1}`.\nSpecifically:\n1.  `s` is `P_{n-1} + S_1`. (The prefix of length `n-1` followed by the last character of `s`).\n2.  `s` is `P_1 + S_{n-1}`. (The first character of `s` followed by the suffix of length `n-1`).\n\nAlso, `P_{n-1}` is `s` without its last character, and `S_{n-1}` is `s` without its first character. This implies that `P_{n-1}[1:]` must be equal to `S_{n-1}[:-1]`, as both represent `s[1:n-1]`.\n\nThere are two strings of length `n-1` in the input. Let's call them `str1` and `str2`.\nThere are two possible candidates for the original string `s`:\n*   **Candidate 1:** Assume `str1` is `P_{n-1}` and `str2` is `S_{n-1}`.\n    *   For this to be valid, `str1[1:]` must be equal to `str2[:-1]`.\n    *   If valid, the reconstructed string `s_candidate1` would be `str1 + str2[-1]`.\n*   **Candidate 2:** Assume `str2` is `P_{n-1}` and `str1` is `S_{n-1}`.\n    *   For this to be valid, `str2[1:]` must be equal to `str1[:-1]`.\n    *   If valid, the reconstructed string `s_candidate2` would be `str2 + str1[-1]`.\n\nSince the problem guarantees that the input strings are prefixes and suffixes of *some* existing string, at least one of these candidates must lead to a valid `s`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Store Input:** Read `n` and all `2n-2` strings. Store them in a list, maintaining their original order, as this order is needed for the output.\n2.  **Identify Length `n-1` Strings:** Find the two strings of length `n-1`. Let them be `s_len_n_minus_1_A` and `s_len_n_minus_1_B`.\n3.  **Form Candidate `s` Strings:**\n    *   `s_cand1 = s_len_n_minus_1_A + s_len_n_minus_1_B[-1]`\n    *   `s_cand2 = s_len_n_minus_1_B + s_len_n_minus_1_A[-1]`\n4.  **Validate and Choose `s`:**\n    *   **Check `s_cand1`:**\n        *   Generate all prefixes of `s_cand1`: `s_cand1[0:k]` for `k=1` to `n-1`.\n        *   Generate all suffixes of `s_cand1`: `s_cand1[n-k:n]` for `k=1` to `n-1`.\n        *   Collect all these `2n-2` generated strings into a multiset (or frequency map).\n        *   Compare this multiset with the multiset of the input strings. If they are identical, then `s_cand1` is a valid candidate for `s`.\n    *   **Check `s_cand2`:**\n        *   Do the same for `s_cand2`.\n    *   Since at least one `s` is guaranteed to exist, at least one of these checks will pass. We can pick the first one that passes. Let the chosen string be `final_s`.\n5.  **Assign 'P' or 'S' to Input Strings:**\n    *   Initialize an empty list `assignments` of length `2n-2`.\n    *   Create two multisets: `required_prefixes` and `required_suffixes`.\n        *   `required_prefixes` will contain `final_s[0:k]` for `k=1` to `n-1`.\n        *   `required_suffixes` will contain `final_s[n-k:n]` for `k=1` to `n-1`.\n    *   Iterate through the original input strings (in their given order):\n        *   For each input string `current_str`:\n            *   If `current_str` is in `required_prefixes` (and its count is > 0):\n                *   Assign 'P' to `assignments` for this string's position.\n                *   Decrement its count in `required_prefixes`.\n            *   Else (it must be a suffix):\n                *   Assign 'S' to `assignments` for this string's position.\n                *   Decrement its count in `required_suffixes`.\n    *   Print the joined characters in `assignments`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n = 5`\nInput strings: `ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba`\n\n1.  **Input:**\n    `input_strings = ['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']`\n    `input_counts = Counter(input_strings)` (for validation later)\n\n2.  **Length `n-1 = 4` strings:**\n    `s_len_n_minus_1_A = 'abab'`\n    `s_len_n_minus_1_B = 'baba'`\n\n3.  **Candidate `s` strings:**\n    *   `s_cand1 = 'abab' + 'baba'[-1] = 'ababa'`\n    *   `s_cand2 = 'baba' + 'abab'[-1] = 'baba' + 'b' = 'babab'`\n\n4.  **Validate `s_cand1 = 'ababa'`:**\n    *   Prefixes: `a, ab, aba, abab`\n    *   Suffixes: `a, ba, aba, baba`\n    *   Combined required: `a, a, ab, ba, aba, aba, abab, baba`\n    *   Input strings (sorted for comparison): `a, a, ab, aba, aba, abab, ba, baba`\n    *   Multiset of required == Multiset of input. So `s_cand1 = 'ababa'` is a valid candidate. `final_s = 'ababa'`.\n\n5.  **Assign 'P'/'S' for `final_s = 'ababa'`:**\n    *   `required_prefixes = Counter({'a': 1, 'ab': 1, 'aba': 1, 'abab': 1})`\n    *   `required_suffixes = Counter({'a': 1, 'ba': 1, 'aba': 1, 'baba': 1})`\n    *   `assignments = []`\n\n    Processing input strings:\n    *   `'ba'`: Is in `required_prefixes`? No. Is in `required_suffixes`? Yes. `assignments.append('S')`. `required_suffixes['ba'] -= 1`.\n    *   `'a'`: Is in `required_prefixes`? Yes. `assignments.append('P')`. `required_prefixes['a'] -= 1`.\n    *   `'abab'`: Is in `required_prefixes`? Yes. `assignments.append('P')`. `required_prefixes['abab'] -= 1`.\n    *   `'a'`: Is in `required_prefixes`? No (count is 0). Is in `required_suffixes`? Yes. `assignments.append('S')`. `required_suffixes['a'] -= 1`.\n    *   `'aba'`: Is in `required_prefixes`? Yes. `assignments.append('P')`. `required_prefixes['aba'] -= 1`.\n    *   `'baba'`: Is in `required_prefixes`? No. Is in `required_suffixes`? Yes. `assignments.append('S')`. `required_suffixes['baba'] -= 1`.\n    *   `'ab'`: Is in `required_prefixes`? Yes. `assignments.append('P')`. `required_prefixes['ab'] -= 1`.\n    *   `'aba'`: Is in `required_prefixes`? No (count is 0). Is in `required_suffixes`? Yes. `assignments.append('S')`. `required_suffixes['aba'] -= 1`.\n\n    Result: `SPPSPSPS`\n\nThis approach correctly handles the problem constraints and guarantees.
