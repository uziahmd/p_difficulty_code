Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. My goal is to write a Python script to find the minimum light radius needed to illuminate an entire street.**\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe've got a street of length `l` with `n` lanterns positioned at various points `a_i` along it. Each lantern shines in a radius `d`, creating lit segments. The challenge is to find the *smallest* radius `d` that ensures the whole street (from 0 to `l`) is covered by light.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n*   **Sorting is Crucial:** The positions of the lanterns need to be sorted. This allows me to efficiently analyze the gaps between lanterns.\n*   **Three Requirements:** To solve this, I need to consider these three things:\n\n    1.  **Left Edge:** The beginning of the street (position 0) must be lit.\n    2.  **Right Edge:** The end of the street (position `l`) must be lit.\n    3.  **Internal Gaps:** The segments *between* adjacent lanterns must also be covered.\n\n*   **Gaps Matter:**  The biggest gap between the lanterns dictates the most radius needed within the street. The largest gaps are what determines the minimum radius required\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Input:** First, read the input: `n` (number of lanterns), `l` (street length), and the positions `a_i` of the lanterns.\n2.  **Sort:** Sort the lantern positions in ascending order.\n3.  **Find the Biggest Gap:** Calculate the maximum distance between any two adjacent lanterns.\n4.  **Calculate Edge Radii:** Figure out the radius needed to cover the left end (0) and the right end (`l`).\n5.  **Calculate Internal Gap Radius:** Consider a gap between two lanterns. Each needs to contribute to cover the gap. The longest gap needs to be covered as well.\n6.  **The Minimum `d`:**  Take the *largest* of the radius values calculated in steps 3, 4, and 5. This is the final answer.\n7.  **Output:** Print the calculated minimum radius `d` with 10 decimal places.\n\n**Code Logic Details:**\n\n*   I'll iterate through the sorted lantern positions to find the maximum gap. For example, if two adjacent lanterns are positioned at points *a* and *b*, the code will need to cover this segment `a` to `b`.\n\n*   To cover the point 0: if the nearest lantern is at position *x*, its radius must be at least *x*.\n\n*   Similarly, to cover the right end of the street, the last lantern's radius needs to be at least `l - last_lantern_position`.\n\n*   To cover an internal gap between two adjacent lanterns at *a* and *b*:\n    *   The gap needs to be covered\n    *   The formula becomes: `d = (b - a) / 2`. The largest internal gap will determine the `d`.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n\n*   If there's only one lantern, I must consider both ends of the road and how much radius is necessary.\n*   If lanterns are at both ends of the street (0 and `l`), the coverage is straightforward.\n\n**Precision:**\n\nI'll use Python's `float` type (double-precision) to handle the calculations and use `f\"{result_d:.10f}\"` when printing the output to meet the desired precision.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nI'll carefully review the logic, test cases, and edge scenarios to ensure the code gives the correct output and meets the precision requirements. The code should now be ready!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the minimum light radius `d` such that `n` lanterns, placed at given positions `a_i` on a street of length `l` (from 0 to `l`), light the entire street. Each lantern at `a_i` lights the segment `[a_i - d, a_i + d]`.\n\nTo ensure the entire street `[0, l]` is lit, we need to consider three types of segments that must be covered:\n\n1.  **The left end of the street:** The segment `[0, a_0]` (where `a_0` is the position of the leftmost lantern) must be covered. The lantern at `a_0` needs to extend its light to cover point 0. This means `a_0 - d <= 0`, which implies `d >= a_0`. So, the minimum `d` required for the left end is `a_0`.\n\n2.  **The right end of the street:** The segment `[a_{n-1}, l]` (where `a_{n-1}` is the position of the rightmost lantern) must be covered. The lantern at `a_{n-1}` needs to extend its light to cover point `l`. This means `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, which implies `d >= l - a_{n-1}`. So, the minimum `d` required for the right end is `l - a_{n-1}`.\n\n3.  **Gaps between adjacent lanterns:** For any two adjacent lanterns at `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, the segment `[a_i, a_{i+1}]` must be fully covered. The lantern at `a_i` lights up to `a_i + d`, and the lantern at `a_{i+1}` lights from `a_{i+1} - d`. To ensure there's no unlit gap between them, their coverage areas must meet or overlap. That is, `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`. This simplifies to `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. We need to find the maximum value of `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` across all adjacent pairs of lanterns.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Read Input:** Read `n`, `l`, and the list of lantern positions `a_i`.\n2.  **Sort Lantern Positions:** Sort the list `a_i` in ascending order. This makes it easy to identify the leftmost, rightmost, and adjacent lanterns.\n3.  **Calculate `d` for internal gaps:** Iterate through the sorted lantern positions from `i = 0` to `n - 2`. For each pair `(a_i, a_{i+1})`, calculate the distance `a_{i+1} - a_i`. The `d` required to cover this gap is `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. Keep track of the maximum `d` found among all such gaps. Let's call this `d_internal_gaps`.\n4.  **Calculate `d` for left edge:** This is simply `a[0]` (the position of the first lantern). Let's call this `d_left_edge`.\n5.  **Calculate `d` for right edge:** This is `l - a[n-1]` (the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street). Let's call this `d_right_edge`.\n6.  **Determine Final Minimum `d`:** The minimum light radius `d` required to light the entire street is the maximum of `d_internal_gaps`, `d_left_edge`, and `d_right_edge`.\n7.  **Print Output:** Print the calculated `d` value, formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirements.\n\n**Example:**\n`n = 2, l = 5`, lanterns at `a = [2, 5]`\n\n1.  Sorted `a = [2, 5]`.\n2.  **Internal gaps:** Only one pair `(2, 5)`. Gap length `5 - 2 = 3`. `d_internal_gaps = 3 / 2 = 1.5`.\n3.  **Left edge:** `a[0] = 2`. `d_left_edge = 2.0`.\n4.  **Right edge:** `l - a[n-1] = 5 - 5 = 0`. `d_right_edge = 0.0`.\n5.  **Final `d`:** `max(1.5, 2.0, 0.0) = 2.0`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n (number of lanterns) and l (length of the street)\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the lantern positions as a list of integers\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Sort the lantern positions to easily find the leftmost, rightmost,\n    # and distances between adjacent lanterns.\n    a.sort()\n\n    # Initialize max_gap_length to 0.0.
