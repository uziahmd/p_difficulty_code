He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Prefixes and Suffixes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" The gist is this: I'm given a bunch of strings, specifically `2n-2` of them. These are all the prefixes and suffixes of a secret string `s` of length `n`, but they're *improper* – meaning they're shorter than `s` itself. Specifically, they range in length from 1 up to `n-1`. For each possible length `k`, there's exactly one prefix (the beginning of `s`) and one suffix (the end of `s`). The goal is to figure out for each of those input strings whether it represents a prefix or a suffix of that original, full string. I need to output a string containing 'P's and 'S's accordingly.\n\nMy strategy needs to ensure an equal number of 'P's and 'S's, each being `n-1` to match the given strings. Thankfully, the problem guarantees a valid `s`, so I can assume a solution exists.\n\nThe key insight here is the unique lengths. Each of the lengths has exactly one prefix and one suffix. That's my starting point. The crucial part is figuring out the original string `s`, which will allow me to identify each input string as a prefix or suffix.\n\nI know that the two strings of length `n-1` are crucial. They're `s` almost in its entirety. They're either `s[0...n-2]` or `s[1...n-1]`. So I need to grab those two and find a way to distinguish between them.\n\nThe full string `s` is going to be built by adding one of the last character of one to the other. There are two possibilities: I take the first string and add the last character of the second string to it. Or I can do it in reverse. I'll need to check if the second string, for example, is actually equal to `s[1...n-1]`. I would build s, for instance, in the case I take the first string and extend it with the last character of the second, as `str1 + str2[-1]`. Then I have to confirm that `str2` is the suffix by checking if `str2[0...n-2]` (which is the same as `str2`) is equal to `(str1 + str2[-1])[1...n-1]`. Simplifies to check if `str2[:-1]` and `str1[1:]` are equal. I can do it in the other direction as well.\n\nI'll explore both possibilities and see which one yields a consistent string `s`. Once I have `s`, the prefix/suffix identification will become a simple comparison. It should be pretty straightforward from there.\n",
