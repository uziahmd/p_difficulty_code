And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to figure out the average sleep time across all possible 'k'-day weeks, given a record of sleep times for 'n' days. Let's think this through.\n\nFirst, I need to clearly define the inputs:  I'll have `n` (total days), `k` (days per week), and the array `a` with the sleep times for each day. The constraints on `n` and `k` are important here: I know these values can be quite large, up to 200,000, so efficiency is going to be key.\n\nA \"week\" simply means a sequence of `k` consecutive days. The number of weeks I'll need to consider is straightforward: it's just `n - k + 1`. This makes sense; if I have 10 days and 2-day weeks, I'll have 9 weeks. The goal is to calculate the average sleep time across *all* these weeks. This means summing the total sleep time for each week and then dividing by the number of weeks.\n\nI can visualize this as:  `(Sum of week 1 + Sum of week 2 + ... + Sum of week (n-k+1)) / (n-k+1)`.  Let's call the sum of sleep times for a week starting at day `i` as `S_i`. So, I'll need to calculate `(S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) / (n-k+1)`.\n\nTo illustrate, take this simple example: `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`. I have two weeks: (3+4) and (4+7), and thus the average would be (7+11)/2=9, which is the expected result.\n\nNow, here's where things get interesting. I know a naive approach could involve iterating through each week and summing the `k` sleep times for each. However, because of the large `n` values, that O(n*k) approach can quickly become inefficient, especially when `k` gets large.\n\nI need to optimize my algorithm. I see a chance for using a sliding window. Since I need to calculate the sum `S_i` and `S_{i+1}`, I can recognize that  `S_{i+1} = S_i - a_i + a_{i+k}`.  This lets me compute each week's sum, `S_{i+1}`, from the previous one, `S_i`, in constant time (remove the first element and add the next one).  This should get me the answer in a far more efficient way.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the average sleep time over all possible `k`-day weeks. Polycarp has `n` days of sleep records: `a1, a2, ..., an`. A week consists of `k` consecutive days. There are `n - k + 1` such weeks. For example, the first week covers days `a1` to `ak`, the second week covers `a2` to `ak+1`, and so on, until the last week which covers `an-k+1` to `an`. We need to find the sum of sleep times for each of these `n - k + 1` weeks, add all these sums together, and then divide by the total number of weeks (`n - k + 1`).\n\nLet `S_i` be the sum of sleep times for the `i`-th week (starting on day `i` and ending on day `i+k-1`). We need to compute `(S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}) / (n-k+1)`.\n\nA naive approach would be to iterate through all `n - k + 1` weeks, and for each week, sum its `k` elements. This would take `O((n - k + 1) * k)` time. Given `n` can be up to `2 * 10^5`, this could be `O(n^2)` in the worst case (e.g., when `k` is about `n/2`), which is too slow (`4 * 10^{10}` operations).\n\nWe can optimize this using a sliding window approach for calculating the sum of each week.\n1.  **Calculate the sum of the first week**: `current_sum = a1 + a2 + ... + ak`. This takes `O(k)` time.\n2.  **Initialize total sum**: `total_overall_sum = current_sum`.\n3.  **Slide the window**: For subsequent weeks, we can update `current_sum` in `O(1)` time.\n    The sum for the `(i+1)`-th week (`S_{i+1}`) can be obtained from the sum of the `i`-th week (`S_i`) by subtracting the element that leaves the window (`a_i`) and adding the new element that enters the window (`a_{i+k}`).\n    So, `S_{i+1} = S_i - a_i + a_{i+k}`.\n    We iterate from `i = 0` to `n - k - 1` (using 0-based indexing for `a`). In each step:\n    *   `current_sum = current_sum - a[i] + a[i+k]`\n    *   `total_overall_sum = total_overall_sum + current_sum`\n    This loop runs `n - k` times, with `O(1)` operations per iteration.\n\nThe total time complexity will be `O(k)` for the initial sum + `O(n - k)` for sliding the window, which simplifies to `O(n)`. This is efficient enough for `n = 2 * 10^5`.\n\nFinally, the average is `total_overall_sum / (n - k + 1)`. The result should be a floating-point number with sufficient precision.\n\nExample: `n=3, k=2, a=[3, 4, 7]`\n1.  `n_weeks = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.\n2.  Initial `current_sum` (for `a[0]` to `a[1]`): `3 + 4 = 7`.\n3.  `total_overall_sum = 7`.\n4.  Slide window (`i` from `0` to `3 - 2 - 1 = 0`):\n    *   `i = 0`:\n        *   `current_sum = current_sum - a[0] + a[0+2] = 7 - 3 + 7 = 11`. (This is the sum for `a[1]` to `a[2]`)\n        *   `total_overall_sum = total_overall_sum + current_sum = 7 + 11 = 18`.\n5.  Average: `18 / 2 = 9.0`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n and k from the first line\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Read the array a from the second line\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the first k elements (first week)\n    current_week_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\n    # Initialize the total sum of all weekly sums\n    # This will accumulate S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_{n-k+1}\n    total_sum_of_all_weeks = current_week_sum\n\n    # Use a sliding window to calculate sums for subsequent weeks\n    # The window slides from index 0 up to n-k\n    # For a window starting at index `i`, its elements are `a[i]` to `a[i+k-1]`\n    # The next window starts at `i+1`, elements `a[i+1]` to `a[i+k]`\n    # To get the sum of the next window from the current:\n    # Subtract a[i] (element leaving the window)\n    # Add a[i+k] (element entering the window)\n    for i in range(n - k):\n        # Update current_week_sum for the next window\n        current_week_sum = current_week_sum - a[i] + a[i + k]\n        # Add this new week's sum to the total\n        total_sum_of_all_weeks += current_week_sum\n\n    # The number of possible weeks is n - k + 1\n    num_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n    # Calculate the average\n    average_sleep_time = total_sum_of_all_weeks / num_weeks\n\n    # Output the result formatted to at least 6 decimal places\n    # Using f-string with .10f ensures enough precision\n    print(f\"{average_sleep_time:.10f}\")\n\n# Call the solve function to run the program\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
