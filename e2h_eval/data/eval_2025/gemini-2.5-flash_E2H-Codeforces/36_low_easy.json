The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Radio Tower Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to figure out the probability of a working radio tower configuration. Essentially, I need to find the chance that, given randomly chosen tower locations, I can assign signal powers to make sure that *every* town between 1 and n receives exactly one signal, and that the outside towns (0 and n+1) receive *no* signal.\n\nLet's break this down. First, the setup: we have towns from 0 to n+1 in a line. Towers get built in towns 1 through n with a 50/50 chance. When a tower is built, it gets an integer signal power from 1 to n. A tower's signal reaches towns within a certain range: $|c - i| < p$, where *i* is the tower location, *p* is its power, and *c* is the coordinate of a town.\n\nThe core constraints are:\n\n1.  Towns 0 and n+1 must not receive any signal.  This means that for any built tower at position *i* with power *p*, *i* must be greater than or equal to *p*, and *n+1-i* must be greater than or equal to *p*. Basically, the power can't reach all the way to the edges. Consequently, the maximum power any tower can have is the smaller of its distance to the edges.\n2.  Each town from 1 to n must be covered by *exactly one* tower.  No overlap, no gaps.\n\nThis leads me to think about the reach of each tower. A tower at *i* with power *p* covers the range *i-p+1* to *i+p-1*. I need to carefully choose the powers (*p*) for each tower to ensure complete, non-overlapping coverage of the inner towns while satisfying the boundary conditions.\n\nMy immediate thought is that this is starting to feel like a dynamic programming problem.  There's some inherent structure in the problem that may allow me to find a recursive relationship. I should start by thinking about how to handle the edge constraints, which dictate a maximal tower power for each location. Then, the real complexity is making sure the ranges \"tile\" the internal towns without any gaps or overlaps. It's a matter of finding valid power assignments that satisfy this tiling property.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that, given a random selection of towns for radio tower placement, we can set signal powers to satisfy certain conditions. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ have towers built with probability $1/2$ each.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n1.  **Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.**\n    A tower at town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$. This means it covers the interval $(i-p, i+p)$, or for integer towns, $[i-p+1, i+p-1]$.\n    For town $0$ not to be reached: $i-p+1 > 0 \\implies p \\le i$.\n    For town $n+1$ not to be reached: $i+p-1 < n+1 \\implies p \\le n+1-i$.\n    So, for any tower at $i$ with power $p_i$, we must have $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\n2.  **Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.**\n    This means the intervals $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ for all towers $i \\in S$ must form a partition of the set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. That is, they must be disjoint and their union must be $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nConsider the implications of these conditions.\nIf a tower is placed at town $i$ with power $p_i$, it covers towns $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThe center of this covered range is $i$. The length of the range is $2p_i-1$.\nThe constraint $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ means that the range must be fully contained within $[1, n]$.\nSpecifically, $i-p_i+1 \\ge 1$ and $i+p_i-1 \\le n$.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the covered intervals. If town $k$ is covered by tower $i$ with power $p_i$, then $i-p_i+1 \\le k \\le i+p_i-1$.\nThe \"exactly one tower\" condition means that for any $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there is a unique $i \\in S$ and a unique $p_i$ such that $k$ is in $R(i, p_i)$. Since $p_i$ is chosen for each $i$, this means the sets $R(i, p_i)$ must be disjoint and cover $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nConsider a tower at town $i$. If it covers town $k$, then $k$ must be \"closer\" to $i$ than to any other tower $j \\in S$.\nSpecifically, if we have towers at $i$ and $j$ ($i<j$), and $p_i, p_j$ are their powers, then for the intervals to be disjoint and cover $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there must be some splitting point.\nLet's denote $L_i = i-p_i+1$ and $R_i = i+p_i-1$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ implies $L_i \\ge 1$ and $R_i \\le n$.\nThe disjoint union condition means that if we sort the towers $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k$, then their covered intervals $[L_{i_1}, R_{i_1}], [L_{i_2}, R_{i_2}], \\dots, [L_{i_k}, R_{i_k}]$ must satisfy:\n$L_{i_1}=1$, $R_{i_k}=n$, and $R_{i_j} + 1 = L_{i_{j+1}}$ for all $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\n\nThis implies that $i_j-p_{i_j}+1 = R_{i_{j-1}}+1$ and $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = L_{i_{j+1}}-1$.\nThe key observation for this type of problem is that if a town $k$ is covered by tower $i$ with power $p_i$, then $k$ must be the closest town to $i$ within its range. This means $p_i$ is related to the distance to the nearest tower on its left and right, or to $0$ and $n+1$.\nSpecifically, for a tower at $i$ to cover a range $[L_i, R_i]$:\n$p_i = i-L_i+1$ and $p_i = R_i-i+1$.\nThis implies $i-L_i+1 = R_i-i+1 \\implies 2i = L_i+R_i$.\nSo, $i$ must be the midpoint of the interval $[L_i, R_i]$.\nThis means that if a tower at $i$ covers an interval $[L_i, R_i]$, then $L_i+R_i$ must be even, and $i = (L_i+R_i)/2$.\nFor the intervals to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$:\n$L_1=1$, $R_k=n$.\nFor $j=1, \\dots, k-1$, $R_j+1 = L_{j+1}$.\nSo $i_1 = (1+R_1)/2$, $i_2 = (R_1+1+R_2)/2$, ..., $i_k = (R_{k-1}+1+n)/2$.\nThis requires $1+R_1$, $R_1+1+R_2$, ..., $R_{k-1}+1+n$ to all be even.\nThis means $R_j$ must have alternating parity: $R_1$ must be odd, $R_2$ must be even, $R_3$ must be odd, etc.\nAlso, $R_k=n$. So $n$ must have the same parity as $R_k$ based on this pattern.\nIf $n$ is odd, $k$ must be odd. If $n$ is even, $k$ must be even.\n\nThis is a known result for problems of this type: A valid configuration exists if and only if there are towers at $i$ and $i+1$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ such that $i$ and $i+1$ are covered by different towers, OR there is a tower at $i$ covering both $i$ and $i+1$.\nThe condition simplifies to: a valid assignment of powers exists if and only if there is *no* pair of adjacent towns $(i, i+1)$ such that *neither* town $i$ *nor* town $i+1$ has a tower.\nWhy?\nIf there is a tower at $i$ and a tower at $i+1$, we can set $p_i=1, p_{i+1}=1$. Town $i$ is covered by $i$, town $i+1$ by $i+1$.\nIf there is a tower at $i$ but not $i+1$, then $i$ must cover $i+1$. This means $p_i \\ge 2$.\nIf there is a tower at $i+1$ but not $i$, then $i+1$ must cover $i$. This means $p_{i+1} \\ge 2$.\nIf there are no towers at $i$ and $i+1$, then $i$ and $i+1$ must be covered by some other towers.\nSuppose $i$ is covered by tower $j$ and $i+1$ is covered by tower $k$.\nIf $j=k$, then tower $j$ covers both $i$ and $i+1$.\nIf $j \\ne k$, then $j$ covers $i$ and $k$ covers $i+1$. But these two intervals must be adjacent, so $R_j = i$ and $L_k = i+1$. This implies $j=(L_j+R_j)/2 = (L_j+i)/2$ and $k=(L_k+R_k)/2 = (i+1+R_k)/2$.\nThe condition $i=(L_j+i)/2 \\implies i=L_j$. So tower $j$ covers exactly $i$. $p_j = 1$.\nThe condition $i+1=(i+1+R_k)/2 \\implies i+1=R_k$. So tower $k$ covers exactly $i+1$. $p_k = 1$.\nThis means if there's no tower at $i$, $i$ must be covered by a tower $j$ with $p_j=1$. This is only possible if $j=i$, which contradicts no tower at $i$.\nTherefore, if a town $k$ has no tower, it must be covered by a tower $j$ with $p_j > 1$.\nIf $j$ covers $k$, then $p_j = |k-j|+1$.\nThe condition \"towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one tower each\" implies that for every $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there exists a unique $i \\in S$ such that $k \\in R(i, p_i)$.\nThis is possible if and only if for every $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, at least one of town $k$ or town $k+1$ has a tower.\nLet $T_k=1$ if a tower is built in town $k$, and $T_k=0$ otherwise.\nThe condition is that there is no $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ such that $T_k=0$ AND $T_{k+1}=0$.\nIn other words, we cannot have two consecutive towns without towers.\n\nLet's prove this.\nSuppose there are no two consecutive towns without towers.\nLet $S$ be the set of towns with towers.\nWe can define $p_i$ for $i \\in S$ as follows:\nFor each $i \\in S$, let $L_i = \\max(\\{0\\} \\cup \\{j \\in S \\mid j < i\\})$ and $R_i = \\min(\\{n+1\\} \\cup \\{j \\in S \\mid j > i\\})$.\nDefine $p_i = \\min(i-L_i, R_i-i)$. This $p_i$ satisfies $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nThe interval covered by tower $i$ with power $p_i$ is $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nConsider the town $k$ that has no tower. $k \\notin S$.\nBy our assumption, $T_k=0 \\implies T_{k-1}=1$ or $T_{k+1}=1$.\nIf $T_{k-1}=1$ and $T_{k+1}=1$, then $k-1 \\in S$ and $k+1 \\in S$.\nFor tower $k-1$, $R_{k-1}$ would be $k+1$. So $p_{k-1} = \\min((k-1)-L_{k-1}, (k+1)-(k-1)) = \\min((k-1)-L_{k-1}, 2)$.\nFor tower $k+1$, $L_{k+1}$ would be $k-1$. So $p_{k+1} = \\min((k+1)-(k-1), R_{k+1}-(k+1)) = \\min(2, R_{k+1}-(k+1))$.\nIf we choose $p_{k-1}=1$ and $p_{k+1}=1$, then $k-1$ covers $k-1$ and $k+1$ covers $k+1$. Town $k$ is not covered. This is wrong.\n\nThe correct formulation is that the set of towns $S$ must be such that we can partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ where each $j \\in S$ is the midpoint of one such interval.\n$j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\nThis implies $L_j+R_j$ must be even.\nIf $L_j=1$, $j=(1+R_j)/2$. $R_j$ must be odd.\nIf $R_j=n$, $j=(L_j+n)/2$. $L_j$ must have the same parity as $n$.\nFor adjacent intervals $[L_a, R_a]$ and $[L_b, R_b]$ (where $R_a+1=L_b$), we have $a=(L_a+R_a)/2$ and $b=(L_b+R_b)/2$.\n$L_a+R_a$ is even, $L_b+R_b$ is even.\n$L_b = R_a+1$.\nSo $L_a+R_a$ is even implies $L_a$ and $R_a$ have the same parity.\n$L_b+R_b$ is even implies $L_b$ and $R_b$ have the same parity.\nSince $L_b = R_a+1$, $L_b$ and $R_a$ have different parities.\nThis means $L_a$ and $L_b$ have different parities.\nAnd $R_a$ and $R_b$ have different parities.\nAnd $a$ and $b$ have different parities. $(L_a+R_a)/2$ and $(L_b+R_b)/2$ must alternate parity.\nThis implies that towers must be placed at $i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k$ such that $i_j$ and $i_{j+1}$ have different parities.\nThis means $i_j$ must be either $i_j = i_j'$ or $i_j = i_j'+1$ for some $i_j'$.\nThis is satisfied if and only if there are no two adjacent towns $k, k+1$ that are both empty.\nThis is a standard result for this type of problem. The condition is exactly that there are no consecutive `00`s in the binary string representing tower placements.\n\nWe need to count the number of binary strings $T_1 T_2 \\dots T_n$ of length $n$ that do not contain \"00\" as a substring.\nLet $dp[k][\\text{last_bit}]$ be the number of such strings of length $k$ ending with `last_bit`.\n$dp[k][0]$: ends with 0. The previous bit must be 1. So $dp[k][0] = dp[k-1][1]$.\n$dp[k][1]$: ends with 1. The previous bit can be 0 or 1. So $dp[k][1] = dp[k-1][0] + dp[k-1][1]$.\nBase cases:\nFor $k=1$:\n$dp[1][0] = 1$ (string \"0\")\n$dp[1][1] = 1$ (string \"1\")\nTotal for $k=1$ is $2$.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence. Let $F_k$ be the $k$-th Fibonacci number with $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThen $dp[k][0] = F_k$.\nAnd $dp[k][1] = F_{k+1}$.\nTotal valid strings of length $k$ is $dp[k][0] + dp[k][1] = F_k + F_{k+1} = F_{k+2}$.\nFor length $n$, the number of valid configurations is $F_{n+2}$.\n\nThe total number of possible configurations of towers is $2^n$ (each of $n$ towns can either have a tower or not).\nThe probability is $\\frac{F_{n+2}}{2^n}$.\nWe need to calculate this modulo $998244353$.\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$\n\nWe need to compute $F_{n+2} \\pmod{998244353}$ and $2^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThen multiply $F_{n+2} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$(2^n)^{-1}$ is the modular multiplicative inverse of $2^n$.\n\nThe maximum value of $n$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$. We can compute Fibonacci numbers up to $F_{200002}$ using matrix exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time or iteratively in $O(n)$ time. Since $n$ is up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$, iterative calculation is fine.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.  Compute $F_{n+2} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n    Initialize $a=0, b=1$.\n    For $i=0$ to $n+1$:\n        $c = (a+b) \\pmod{998244353}$\n        $a=b$\n        $b=c$\n    After loop, $b$ will be $F_{n+2}$. (Corrected: $F_0=0, F_1=1$. To get $F_k$, iterate $k-1$ times. $F_2$ needs 1 iteration. $F_{n+2}$ needs $n+1$ iterations.\n    Let $F[0]=0, F[1]=1$.\n    For $i=2$ to $n+2$: $F[i] = (F[i-1] + F[i-2]) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n    The value we need is $F[n+2]$.\n\n2.  Compute $power\\_of\\_2 = 2^n \\pmod{998244353}$. This can be done using `pow(2, n, MOD)`.\n\n3.  Compute $inv\\_power\\_of\\_2 = (power\\_of\\_2)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$. This can be done using Fermat's Little Theorem: $a^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD}$ if $MOD$ is prime. So `pow(power_of_2, MOD-2, MOD)`.\n\n4.  Result is $(F_{n+2} \\cdot inv\\_power\\_of\\_2) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nExample $n=2$:\n$F_{2+2} = F_4 = 3$.\n$2^2 = 4$.\nProbability = $3/4$.\n$4^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$:\n$998244353 = 4 \\cdot 249561088 + 1$.\n$1 = 998244353 - 4 \\cdot 249561088$.\nSo $4^{-1} \\equiv -249561088 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$-249561088 + 998244353 = 748683265$.\nResult: $(3 \\cdot 748683265) \\pmod{998244353} = 2246049795 \\pmod{998244353} = 748683265$. This matches the example.\n\nExample $n=3$:\n$F_{3+2} = F_5 = 5$.\n$2^3 = 8$.\nProbability = $5/8$.\n$8^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$:\n$998244353 = 8 \\cdot 124780544 + 1$.\n$1 = 998244353 - 8 \\cdot 124780544$.\nSo $8^{-1} \\equiv -124780544 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$-124780544 + 998244353 = 873463809$.\nResult: $(5 \\cdot 873463809) \\pmod{998244353} = 4367319045 \\pmod{998244353} = 373673905$. This doesn't match the example `748683265`.\n\nLet's recheck the problem statement and my interpretation.\nThe example output for $n=3$ is $748683265$. This is $3/4$.\nMy calculation for $n=3$ is $5/8$.\nThe example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$. This is $3/4$.\n\nIt seems the example outputs for $n=2$ and $n=3$ are the same. This is suspicious.\nLet's check the example note for $n=3$:\n\"with probability $1/8$, the towers are built in towns $1, 2$ and $3$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$;\nwith probability $1/8$, only one tower in town $2$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $2$.\"\nThis implies that for $n=3$:\n- Towers at $1,2,3$: $T_1=1, T_2=1, T_3=1$. Valid.\n- Towers at $2$: $T_1=0, T_2=1, T_3=0$. Valid.\nMy condition \"no consecutive 00s\" works for these:\n$111$ (valid)\n$010$ (valid)\n\nWhat are the other valid configurations for $n=3$?\n$111$ (1 configuration)\n$110$ (1 configuration)\n$101$ (1 configuration)\n$011$ (1 configuration)\n$010$ (1 configuration)\nTotal $F_{3+2} = F_5 = 5$ configurations.\n$111, 110, 101, 011, 010$.\nTotal $2^3=8$ configurations.\nThe probability is indeed $5/8$.\n\nThe example output for $n=3$ is $748683265$, which is $3/4$.\nThis means my interpretation of the problem for $n=3$ is inconsistent with the example.\nLet's re-read the problem carefully.\n\"towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal\"\n\"towns $1, 2, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\"\n\nWhat if $n=3$ and towers are only at $1,3$? ($101$)\nTown $1$ must be covered by tower $1$. $p_1=1$. Range $[1,1]$.\nTown $3$ must be covered by tower $3$. $p_3=1$. Range $[3,3]$.\nTown $2$ is not covered. This configuration $101$ is NOT valid.\nMy \"no consecutive 00s\" condition is wrong.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the condition $i = (L_i+R_i)/2$.\nThis condition is derived from $p_i = i-L_i+1$ and $p_i = R_i-i+1$.\nThese two equalities must hold simultaneously for a tower at $i$ to cover the interval $[L_i, R_i]$.\nThis is true. The center of the interval must be the tower itself.\nThis means that if a town $k$ is covered by a tower $i$, then $i$ is the center of the interval covered by $i$.\nSo $i$ must be the integer $(L_i+R_i)/2$.\nThis requires $L_i+R_i$ to be an even number.\nIf $L_i+R_i$ is even, then $L_i$ and $R_i$ must have the same parity.\n\nLet $S=\\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the set of towns with towers, sorted.\nWe need to find $p_{i_j}$ such that the intervals $[i_j-p_{i_j}+1, i_j+p_{i_j}-1]$ are disjoint and cover $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nLet the intervals be $[L_1, R_1], [L_2, R_2], \\dots, [L_k, R_k]$.\nThen $L_1=1, R_k=n$. And $R_j+1=L_{j+1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nFor each interval $[L_j, R_j]$, the tower $i_j$ must be its center: $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\nThis requires $L_j$ and $R_j$ to have the same parity.\nAlso, $p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$.\nThe condition $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$ means:\n$(R_j-L_j+1)/2 \\le (L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+1 \\le L_j+R_j \\implies 1 \\le 2L_j$. This is true since $L_j \\ge 1$.\n$(R_j-L_j+1)/2 \\le n+1-(L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+1 \\le 2n+2-L_j-R_j \\implies 2R_j+1 \\le 2n+2$. This is true since $R_j \\le n$.\n\nSo, the conditions for a valid configuration of towers $S$ are:\n1.  For each $i \\in S$, $i$ must be the midpoint of some interval $[L, R]$ where $L, R$ have the same parity.\n2.  The set of all such intervals must partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis means we need to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ such that for each $j$, $L_j$ and $R_j$ have the same parity, and the midpoint $(L_j+R_j)/2$ must be a town where a tower is built.\nAlso, $L_1=1$, $R_k=n$.\nSince $L_1=1$ (odd), $R_1$ must be odd.\nThen $L_2=R_1+1$ (even), so $R_2$ must be even.\nThen $L_3=R_2+1$ (odd), so $R_3$ must be odd.\nAnd so on. $R_j$ must alternate parity.\nThis implies $n$ must have the same parity as $R_k$.\nIf $n$ is odd, $k$ must be odd. If $n$ is even, $k$ must be even.\n\nLet's test $n=3$.\nPossible partitions of $\\{1,2,3\\}$ into intervals $[L_j,R_j]$ where $L_j,R_j$ have the same parity:\n1.  $[1,1], [2,2], [3,3]$.\n    $L_1=1, R_1=1$ (odd, odd). Midpoint $i_1=(1+1)/2=1$. Tower at $1$.\n    $L_2=2, R_2=2$ (even, even). Midpoint $i_2=(2+2)/2=2$. Tower at $2$.\n    $L_3=3, R_3=3$ (odd, odd). Midpoint $i_3=(3+3)/2=3$. Tower at $3$.\n    This requires towers at $1,2,3$. Configuration $111$. Valid.\n2.  $[1,3]$.\n    $L_1=1, R_1=3$ (odd, odd). Midpoint $i_1=(1+3)/2=2$. Tower at $2$.\n    This requires tower at $2$ only. Configuration $010$. Valid.\n\nThese are the only two valid configurations for $n=3$.\nTotal $2^3=8$ configurations. Probability $2/8 = 1/4$.\nThis matches the example output for $n=3$ ($748683265$).\n\nSo the condition is: A configuration of towers $S$ is valid if and only if $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ can be partitioned into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ such that $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity, and for each $j$, $(L_j+R_j)/2 \\in S$.\nThis implies that for any $j$, if $L_j$ and $R_j$ have different parities, then no tower can cover this interval.\nThe condition \"all towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each\" means we must use all towns.\nThis means that for every $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, $k$ must belong to some $[L_j, R_j]$ where $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity, and $(L_j+R_j)/2 \\in S$.\nThis means that there cannot be any $k$ such that $k$ is not covered by such an interval.\nIf $L_j$ and $R_j$ have the same parity, then $R_j-L_j+1$ is odd. The length of the interval is odd.\nSo, all covered intervals must have odd length.\nThis means $n$ must be an odd number. If $n$ is even, it's impossible to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into odd-length intervals.\nThis is incorrect. For $n=2$, the example output is $3/4$.\nFor $n=2$:\n1. $[1,1], [2,2]$.\n   $L_1=1, R_1=1$ (odd, odd). Midpoint $i_1=1$. Tower at $1$.\n   $L_2=2, R_2=2$ (even, even). Midpoint $i_2=2$. Tower at $2$.\n   Requires towers at $1,2$. Config $11$. Valid.\nTotal $2^2=4$ configurations. Probability $1/4$.\nStill not matching $3/4$.\n\nLet's re-read the example $n=2$: \"with probability $1/4$, the towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\" This is $11$.\nThe example output is $748683265$, which is $3/4$.\nThis means there are 3 valid configurations for $n=2$.\nWhat are they?\nMy analysis of $i=(L_j+R_j)/2$ is too restrictive.\nThe problem states \"set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $1$ to $n$\".\nThe example $n=5$, towers $2,4,5$. Power $p_2=2$, $p_4=1$, $p_5=1$.\nTower $2$ with $p_2=2$: covers $[2-2+1, 2+2-1] = [1,3]$.\nTower $4$ with $p_4=1$: covers $[4-1+1, 4+1-1] = [4,4]$.\nTower $5$ with $p_5=1$: covers $[5-1+1, 5+1-1] = [5,5]$.\nUnion: $[1,3] \\cup [4,4] \\cup [5,5] = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. Disjoint.\nTowns $0, n+1$ (i.e. $0, 6$) not covered.\n$p_2=2 \\le \\min(2, 5+1-2) = \\min(2,4) = 2$. Valid.\n$p_4=1 \\le \\min(4, 5+1-4) = \\min(4,2) = 2$. Valid.\n$p_5=1 \\le \\min(5, 5+1-5) = \\min(5,1) = 1$. Valid.\nThis is a valid configuration. Towers at $2,4,5$. Config $01011$.\nHere, tower $2$ covers $[1,3]$. Its center is $2$. Parity of $1,3$ is odd,odd.\nTower $4$ covers $[4,4]$. Its center is $4$. Parity of $4,4$ is even,even.\nTower $5$ covers $[5,5]$. Its center is $5$. Parity of $5,5$ is odd,odd.\nThis is consistent with my $i=(L_j+R_j)/2$ conditions.\n\nLet's recheck $n=2$.\nValid config $11$: towers at $1,2$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$. Covers $[1,1]$ and $[2,2]$.\nThis is 1 configuration.\nWhat about $01$? Tower at $2$. Can $p_2$ cover $1,2$?\n$p_2=2$. Covers $[2-2+1, 2+2-1] = [1,3]$.\nThis covers $1,2,3$. But $n=2$, so town $3$ is $n+1$. Town $3$ must not be covered.\nSo $p_2=2$ is not allowed because it covers $n+1=3$.\n$p_2 \\le \\min(2, n+1-2) = \\min(2, 2+1-2) = \\min(2,1) = 1$.\nSo $p_2$ must be $1$. Tower at $2$ with $p_2=1$ covers $[2,2]$. Town $1$ is not covered.\nSo $01$ is not valid.\nSimilarly, $10$ is not valid.\n$00$ is not valid.\nSo only $11$ is valid for $n=2$. Probability $1/4$.\nThe example output for $n=2$ is $3/4$.\nThis means my interpretation is still wrong.\n\nThe only way $n=2$ can have $3/4$ probability is if 3 out of 4 configurations are valid.\n$11$: yes (covers $1,2$ with $p_1=1, p_2=1$)\n$10$: tower at $1$. $p_1 \\le \\min(1, 2+1-1) = \\min(1,2) = 1$. So $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. Town $2$ not covered. Invalid.\n$01$: tower at $2$. $p_2 \\le \\min(2, 2+1-2) = \\min(2,1) = 1$. So $p_2=1$. Covers $[2,2]$. Town $1$ not covered. Invalid.\n$00$: no towers. Invalid.\n\nThis means my condition $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ is correct.\nMy decomposition into intervals $i=(L_j+R_j)/2$ is correct.\nThe only possible source of error is the example output or my understanding of the problem statement.\n\"The signal from a tower located in a town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches every city $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$.\"\nThis is equivalent to $i-p < c < i+p$.\nFor integers, this means $c \\in [i-p+1, i+p-1]$. This is what I used.\n\nLet's re-read the example for $n=2$ carefully.\n\"The real answer for the first example is $1/4$: with probability $1/4$, the towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\"\nThis is what I got.\nBut the example output is $748683265$, which is $3/4$.\nThis is a contradiction. The text says $1/4$, but the output says $3/4$.\nI should trust the text in the \"Note\" section. The note explicitly states $1/4$ for $n=2$.\nThe provided output `748683265` for $n=2$ is $3/4$. This suggests the example output for $n=2$ is wrong, or the note is wrong.\n\nLet's check $n=3$ example output.\nThe note says \"The real answer for the second example is $1/4$\".\nMy calculation for $n=3$ gives $5/8$.\nThe provided output for $n=3$ is `748683265`, which is $3/4$.\nAgain, contradiction. Note says $1/4$, output says $3/4$.\n\nLet's check $n=5$ example output.\nThe note says \"The real answer for the third example is $5/32$\".\n$F_{5+2} = F_7 = 13$. $2^5 = 32$. So $13/32$.\nThe provided output for $n=5$ is `842268673`.\n$13 \\cdot 32^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$32^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$: $998244353 = 32 \\cdot 31195136 + 1$.\n$32^{-1} \\equiv -31195136 \\equiv 998244353-31195136 = 967049217 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nResult: $(13 \\cdot 967049217) \\pmod{998244353} = 12571639821 \\pmod{998244353} = 560767570$.\nThis does not match `842268673`.\n\nThis means my Fibonacci sequence interpretation is likely wrong.\nThe \"no consecutive 00s\" condition is for *any* configuration to be valid.\nThe problem is that the \"no consecutive 00s\" condition is for a specific type of covering (where $p_i=1$ for all towers, or $p_i$ is chosen to cover the gap).\nThe condition $i=(L_j+R_j)/2$ is critical.\nThis implies $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nSo every interval $[L,R]$ covered by a tower must have $L,R$ of same parity.\nWhat if $n=2$?\nOnly partition is $[1,2]$. $L=1, R=2$. Different parities.\nSo no tower can cover $[1,2]$.\nThis implies $n=2$ has no valid configuration. Probability 0.\nThis is even stranger.\n\nLet's reconsider the example $n=5$, towers $2,4,5$. $p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1$.\nIntervals: $[1,3]$ (tower 2), $[4,4]$ (tower 4), $[5,5]$ (tower 5).\n$L_1=1, R_1=3$. Parity (odd, odd). $i_1=(1+3)/2=2$. Tower at $2$.\n$L_2=4, R_2=4$. Parity (even, even). $i_2=(4+4)/2=4$. Tower at $4$.\n$L_3=5, R_3=5$. Parity (odd, odd). $i_3=(5+5)/2=5$. Tower at $5$.\nThis implies that for any valid configuration, the intervals must have $L_j$ and $R_j$ of the same parity.\n\nThis means the number of towns in each interval $R_j-L_j+1$ must be odd.\nIf we partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into intervals of odd length, then the total length $n$ must be odd.\nIf $n$ is even, it's impossible to partition it into odd-length intervals.\nThis implies that for $n=2$, the probability should be $0$. But the example says $1/4$ or $3/4$.\nFor $n=4$: probability 0.\nFor $n=6$: probability 0.\n\nThis is a huge contradiction. My understanding of the \"center\" of the interval must be wrong.\nThe signal from a tower at $i$ with power $p$ reaches $c$ such that $|c-i|<p$.\nThis means $i-p+1 \\le c \\le i+p-1$.\nThe center of this interval is $i$. This is mathematically correct.\nThe constraint $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ is also correct.\n\nThe problem must be simpler. Maybe I'm overthinking the \"center\" part.\nWhat if the tower $i$ is not the center of the interval it covers?\nFor a tower at $i$ with power $p_i$, it covers $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThis interval must be part of the partition.\nLet's call $I_j = [L_j, R_j]$ the $j$-th interval in the partition.\nThe tower $i_j$ must be in $S$.\nAnd $I_j = [i_j-p_{i_j}+1, i_j+p_{i_j}-1]$ for some $p_{i_j}$.\nThis implies $L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$.\nThese two equations imply $R_j-L_j = 2p_{i_j}-2$.\nSo $R_j-L_j$ must be an even number.\nThis means $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nThis conclusion is robust.\n\nSo, for $n=2$, it's impossible to partition $\\{1,2\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ where $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity.\nThe only partition of $\\{1,2\\}$ is $\\{[1,2]\\}$. Here $L=1, R=2$, parities are different.\nSo for $n=2$, there are 0 valid configurations. Probability is 0.\nThis contradicts all example outputs for $n=2$.\n\nThe only remaining option is that the problem statement for \"signal reaches every city $c$ such that $|c-i|<p$\" is interpreted differently.\nMaybe $|c-i| \\le p-1$? This is the same.\nMaybe it's $c \\in [i-p, i+p]$? No, \"less than $p$\" means $p-1$ is max distance.\nPerhaps \"signal from a tower located in a town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches every city $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$\" means it reaches towns $i-p+1, \\dots, i+p-1$ *but only if $c \\in [1, n]$*?\nNo, the constraints are explicitly for towns $0$ and $n+1$.\n\nWhat if $n$ is odd? For $n=3$, $L_1=1, R_1=3$. $i_1=(1+3)/2=2$. This is valid. $p_2=(3-1+1)/2=3/2$. Not an integer.\nAh, $p_i$ must be an integer.\n$R_j-L_j+1 = 2p_{i_j}-1+1 = 2p_{i_j}$.\nNo, $p_i = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$ is derived from $p_i=R_j-i+1$ and $p_i=i-L_j+1$.\n$p_i$ must be an integer.\nSo $R_j-L_j+1$ must be an even number.\nThis means $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have different parities.\nThis is the opposite of my previous conclusion.\n\nLet's re-derive $p_i$ from $L_j, R_j, i_j$.\n$L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1 \\implies p_{i_j} = i_j-L_j+1$.\n$R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1 \\implies p_{i_j} = R_j-i_j+1$.\nThese two expressions for $p_{i_j}$ must be equal.\nSo $i_j-L_j+1 = R_j-i_j+1 \\implies 2i_j = L_j+R_j \\implies i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\nThis means $L_j+R_j$ must be even.\nThis means $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nThis implies $(R_j-L_j+1)$ is an odd number.\nIf $R_j-L_j+1$ is odd, then $p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$ cannot be an integer.\nThis implies that the conditions are impossible to satisfy for any $n \\ge 1$.\nThis is clearly wrong. Example $n=5$, $p_2=2$. Interval $[1,3]$. $L=1, R=3$. $R-L+1=3$. $p_2=(3-1+1)/2 = 3/2$. This is not an integer.\n\nThe example $n=5$, towers $2,4,5$, $p_2=2$.\nCovers $[1,3]$. Here $i=2, p=2$.\n$i-p+1 = 2-2+1 = 1$.\n$i+p-1 = 2+2-1 = 3$.\nSo $[1,3]$ is covered. $p_2=2$ is an integer.\nThe issue is with $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$. This is true if $i_j$ is the *center* of the interval $[L_j, R_j]$.\nBut the problem does not state that $i_j$ must be the center. It just says it covers $[i_j-p_{i_j}+1, i_j+p_{i_j}-1]$.\nThis interval *is* centered at $i_j$.\nSo $L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$.\nThis implies $p_{i_j} = R_j-i_j+1$ AND $p_{i_j} = i_j-L_j+1$.\nThis is the key. The *length* of the interval is $R_j-L_j+1$.\nThe length of the interval covered by tower $i_j$ with power $p_{i_j}$ is $(i_j+p_{i_j}-1) - (i_j-p_{i_j}+1) + 1 = 2p_{i_j}-1$.\nSo $R_j-L_j+1$ must be an odd number.\nThis means $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nAnd $p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+1)/2$.\nThis means $R_j-L_j+1$ must be an odd number AND $p_{i_j}$ must be an integer.\nThis implies that $(R_j-L_j+1)/2$ must be an integer.\nThis is a contradiction. An odd number divided by 2 cannot be an integer.\n\nThis means my understanding of $p$ is fundamentally flawed.\n\"signal power $p$\" is an integer.\n\"reaches every city $c$ such that $|c-i|<p$\".\nLet $p=1$. $|c-i|<1 \\implies c=i$. So it reaches town $i$. Range $[i,i]$. Length $1$.\nLet $p=2$. $|c-i|<2 \\implies c=i-1, i, i+1$. So it reaches towns $i-1, i, i+1$. Range $[i-1,i+1]$. Length $3$.\nLet $p=3$. $|c-i|<3 \\implies c=i-2, i-1, i, i+1, i+2$. So it reaches towns $i-2, \\dots, i+2$. Range $[i-2,i+2]$. Length $5$.\nIn general, for power $p$, it reaches towns $i-(p-1), \\dots, i+(p-1)$.\nThe length of this interval is $2(p-1)+1 = 2p-1$.\nThis length is always an odd number.\nAnd $p = (\\text{length}+1)/2$.\n\nSo, for any interval $[L_j, R_j]$ covered by a tower $i_j$:\n1.  $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity (because $R_j-L_j+1$ must be odd).\n2.  The tower $i_j$ must be the center of the interval: $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\n3.  The power is $p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+1+1)/2 = (R_j-L_j+2)/2$. This must be an integer.\n    Since $R_j-L_j+1$ is odd, $R_j-L_j$ is even. So $R_j-L_j+2$ is even. So $p_{i_j}$ is always an integer.\n4.  The range constraint: $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n    $(R_j-L_j+2)/2 \\le (L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+2 \\le L_j+R_j \\implies 2 \\le 2L_j \\implies L_j \\ge 1$. (True)\n    $(R_j-L_j+2)/2 \\le n+1-(L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+2 \\le 2n+2-L_j-R_j \\implies 2R_j+2 \\le 2n+2 \\implies R_j \\le n$. (True)\n\nSo, the conditions for a valid configuration of towers $S$ are:\n1.  We must be able to partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$.\n2.  For each interval $[L_j, R_j]$, $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity. (This means $R_j-L_j+1$ is odd).\n3.  For each interval $[L_j, R_j]$, its midpoint $i_j=(L_j+R_j)/2$ must be a town where a tower is built (i.e., $i_j \\in S$).\n\nLet's re-test $n=2$:\nThe only partition of $\\{1,2\\}$ is $[1,2]$. $L=1, R=2$. Parities are different.\nThis fails condition 2. So for $n=2$, there are 0 valid configurations. Probability 0.\nThis still contradicts the example outputs.\n\nWhat if $n$ is odd, e.g. $n=3$?\nPartitions of $\\{1,2,3\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ where $L_j, R_j$ have same parity:\n1.  $[1,1], [2,2], [3,3]$.\n    $i_1=1, i_2=2, i_3=3$. Requires towers at $1,2,3$. Config $111$. Valid.\n2.  $[1,3]$.\n    $i_1=2$. Requires tower at $2$. Config $010$. Valid.\nThese are the only two. Probability $2/8 = 1/4$.\nThis matches the *note* for $n=3$.\nSo for $n=3$, my logic gives $1/4$. The note says $1/4$. The output says $3/4$.\nThe example outputs are probably incorrect, and the note is correct.\n\nLet's re-test $n=5$:\nThe note says $5/32$. My logic should give $F_{5+2}/2^5 = F_7/32 = 13/32$.\nThis implies my condition \"no consecutive 00s\" is still wrong.\nThe condition \"no consecutive 00s\" is equivalent to \"every town $k$ or $k+1$ has a tower\".\nThis is equivalent to $T_k+T_{k+1} \\ge 1$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nLet's re-examine the condition \"no consecutive 00s\" and its relation to the interval partitioning.\nThe number of valid configurations is $F_{n+2}$.\nFor $n=1$: $F_3=2$. Configurations $1, 0$. Both are valid. $1/2$.\n$1$: $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. $1 \\in S$. Valid.\n$0$: no towers. Invalid.\nSo for $n=1$, only $1$ is valid. Probability $1/2$. My $F_{n+2}/2^n$ gives $2/2=1$.\nThis means the Fibonacci formula is wrong.\n\nWhat if $n=1$?\nTowns $0,1,2$. Tower in town $1$ with prob $1/2$.\nIf tower in town $1$: $S=\\{1\\}$. $p_1 \\le \\min(1, 1+1-1) = 1$. So $p_1=1$.\nTower $1$ with $p_1=1$ covers $[1,1]$. Town $1$ gets signal. Towns $0,2$ don't. Valid.\nIf no tower in town $1$: $S=\\emptyset$. Town $1$ gets no signal. Invalid.\nSo for $n=1$, only $1$ configuration is valid. Probability $1/2$.\n\nMy formula $F_{n+2}/2^n$ gives $1$ for $n=1$.\nThis means my logic $dp[k][0]=F_k, dp[k][1]=F_{k+1}$ is for $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2$.\n$n=1$: $F_{1+2}=F_3=2$. Total valid is $2$. $2/2^1 = 1$.\nThe valid configurations for \"no 00s\":\n$k=1$: \"0\", \"1\". Both valid.\nBut \"0\" (no tower at 1) is not valid for $n=1$.\nSo the \"no 00s\" condition is not exactly right.\n\nThe condition is that *every* town $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ must be covered.\nIf $T_k=0$ (no tower at $k$), then $k$ must be covered by some $i \\in S$ where $i \\ne k$.\nThis means $p_i > |k-i|$.\nThis implies that if $T_k=0$, then $T_{k-1}=1$ and $T_{k+1}=1$ is not enough.\nFor $n=1$, $T_1=0$. Town $1$ needs to be covered. No other towers. Impossible.\nFor $n=3$, $T_1=0, T_2=1, T_3=0$. (Config $010$).\nTower at $2$. $p_2 \\le \\min(2, 3+1-2) = \\min(2,2) = 2$.\nIf $p_2=1$, covers $[2,2]$. Towns $1,3$ not covered. Invalid.\nIf $p_2=2$, covers $[1,3]$. Towns $1,2,3$ covered. Valid.\nSo $010$ is valid for $n=3$. (This matches the example note.)\n\nFor $n=2$, $T_1=0, T_2=1$. (Config $01$).\nTower at $2$. $p_2 \\le \\min(2, 2+1-2) = 1$. So $p_2=1$.\nCovers $[2,2]$. Town $1$ not covered. Invalid.\nThis means $01$ is not valid for $n=2$.\nSimilarly $10$ is not valid for $n=2$.\nOnly $11$ is valid for $n=2$. Probability $1/4$.\nThis matches the *note* for $n=2$.\nSo the example outputs are definitely wrong, and the notes are correct.\n\nMy current reasoning:\nA configuration of towers $S$ is valid if and only if:\n1.  For every $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there exists $i \\in S$ such that $k \\in [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ for some integer $p_i \\in [1, \\min(i, n+1-i)]$.\n2.  For every $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, this $i$ is unique.\nThis is equivalent to saying that we can partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ such that for each $j$:\n(a) There is an $i_j \\in S$ that covers $[L_j, R_j]$. This means $L_j=i_j-p_{i_j}+1$ and $R_j=i_j+p_{i_j}-1$ for some integer $p_{i_j}$.\n(b) $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n\nFrom (a), $R_j-L_j+1 = 2p_{i_j}-1$. So $R_j-L_j+1$ must be odd. This means $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity.\nAlso, $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$.\nAnd $p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+2)/2$.\n\nThe condition on $S$ is:\nCan we partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ such that for each $j$:\n1. $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity.\n2. $(L_j+R_j)/2 \\in S$.\n3. $(R_j-L_j+2)/2 \\le \\min((L_j+R_j)/2, n+1-(L_j+R_j)/2)$. (This simplifies to $L_j \\ge 1$ and $R_j \\le n$, which is guaranteed by partitioning $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$).\n\nSo, the problem is to count binary strings $T_1 \\dots T_n$ such that we can partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ where $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity, and $T_{(L_j+R_j)/2}=1$.\nThis is a recursive structure.\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of ways to cover towns $1, \\dots, k$ according to these rules.\nTo cover town $k$: it must be the rightmost town of some interval $[L, k]$.\n$L$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\nThe tower must be at $(L+k)/2$.\n$dp[k]$: number of ways to cover $1 \\dots k$.\n$dp[0]=1$ (empty prefix)\n$dp[k] = \\sum_{L \\text{ s.t. } L,k \\text{ same parity}} (\\text{tower at } (L+k)/2 \\text{ is } 1) \\cdot dp[L-1]$\nThis is not easy.\n\nLet's simplify.\nA valid configuration is a selection of towers $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that we can partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into segments $[L_1, R_1], \\dots, [L_k, R_k]$ where $L_1=1, R_k=n, R_j+1=L_{j+1}$, and for each $j$:\n1. $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity.\n2. The tower $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ is in $S$.\n3. All other towns $x \\in [L_j, R_j]$, $x \\ne i_j$, are not in $S$. (This is implied by \"exactly one tower\").\n4. No other towns in $S$ exist. (This is implied by \"exactly one tower\").\n\nThis implies that for any interval $[L_j, R_j]$, only one tower $i_j=(L_j+R_j)/2$ is allowed to be present.\nAll other towns in $S$ must be midpoints of other intervals.\nThis defines a set $S$.\nSo the condition is: can we partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ such that $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity, and for each $j$, the town $(L_j+R_j)/2$ has a tower, and all other towns $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ where $k \\ne (L_j+R_j)/2$ for any $j$, do not have towers.\nThis is equivalent to saying: we choose a partition. For each interval in the partition, we *must* place a tower at its midpoint. All other towns *must not* have towers.\nSo, a configuration $S$ is valid if and only if $S$ is the set of midpoints of some valid partition.\n\nLet $N_k$ be the number of ways to partition $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ where $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity.\nFor $k=1$: $[1,1]$. $L=1,R=1$. Same parity. $i=(1+1)/2=1$. This is 1 way.\nFor $k=2$: $[1,2]$. $L=1,R=2$. Different parity. No way.\nFor $k=3$:\n  $[1,1], [2,2], [3,3]$. All same parity. 1 way.\n  $[1,3]$. $L=1,R=3$. Same parity. 1 way.\nTotal $N_3=2$.\nFor $k=4$:\n  $[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4]$. $L,R$ same parity for all. 1 way.\n  $[1,1],[2,4]$. $L=2,R=4$ same parity. 1 way.\n  $[1,3],[4,4]$. $L=1,R=3$ same parity. 1 way.\nTotal $N_4=3$.\nFor $k=5$:\n  $[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]$. 1 way.\n  $[1,1],[2,2],[3,5]$. 1 way.\n  $[1,1],[2,4],[5,5]$. 1 way.\n  $[1,3],[4,4],[5,5]$. 1 way.\n  $[1,3],[4,6]$ (no, $R_j \\le n$)\n  $[1,5]$. 1 way.\n  $[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]$ (no $L_1=1$)\nTotal $N_5=5$.\n\nThis sequence $N_k$: $N_1=1, N_2=0, N_3=2, N_4=3, N_5=5$.\nThis looks like $F_{k+1}$ if $k$ is odd, and $F_{k+1}-1$ if $k$ is even.\nNo, $F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$.\n$N_1=F_2=1$.\n$N_2=0$.\n$N_3=F_4=3$. Hmm, my $N_3=2$.\nThe partitions are:\n$k=1: [1,1]$. Midpoint $1$. Config $1$.\n$k=2: $ No valid partitions.\n$k=3: [1,1],[2,2],[3,3]$. Midpoints $1,2,3$. Config $111$.\n       $[1,3]$. Midpoint $2$. Config $010$.\nThese are 2 ways.\n\nThe number of ways to partition $1 \\dots n$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ where $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity:\nLet $dp[k]$ be this count.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[k] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\text{ and } k \\text{ have same parity}}^k dp[L-1]$\n$dp[k] = dp[k-1]$ if $k$ and $k-1$ have different parities (i.e. $k$ is even).\n$dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-3] + \\dots + dp[0]$ if $k$ and $k-1$ have same parities (i.e. $k$ is odd).\nThis is not correct.\n$dp[k]$ is the number of ways to partition $1 \\dots k$.\nTo calculate $dp[k]$:\nThe last interval must be $[L, k]$. $L$ and $k$ must have the same parity.\n$dp[k] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv k \\pmod 2}^k dp[L-1]$.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]$: $k=1$. $L=1$. $dp[1] = dp[0] = 1$.\n$dp[2]$: $k=2$. $L=2$. $dp[2] = dp[1] = 1$.\n$dp[3]$: $k=3$. $L=1,3$. $dp[3] = dp[0] + dp[2] = 1+1 = 2$.\n$dp[4]$: $k=4$. $L=2,4$. $dp[4] = dp[1] + dp[3] = 1+2 = 3$.\n$dp[5]$: $k=5$. $L=1,3,5$. $dp[5] = dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4] = 1+1+3 = 5$.\nThis sequence $1,1,2,3,5$ is $F_{k+1}$ for $k \\ge 1$.\n$dp[k] = F_{k+1}$ for $k \\ge 1$, and $dp[0]=1$.\nThe number of valid configurations is $F_{n+1}$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_{1+1}=F_2=1$. Probability $1/2$. (Matches my derivation).\nFor $n=2$, $F_{2+1}=F_3=2$. Probability $2/4=1/2$.\n  Valid configs for $n=2$:\n  My derivation: $11$ ($p_1=1, p_2=1$) is the only one. Prob $1/4$.\n  $F_{n+1}$ implies 2 configs. What is the other one?\n  $k=2: [1,1],[2,2]$. Midpoints $1,2$. Towers at $1,2$. Config $11$.\n         $[2,2]$ is valid. $L=2,R=2$. $i=2$.\n         $dp[2]$ is the sum over $L \\equiv 2 \\pmod 2$.\n         $L=2$: $[2,2]$. $dp[1]$ for $1 \\dots 1$. $dp[1]=1$. So one way.\n         This is the config $T_1=0, T_2=1$. But $T_1=0$ is not covered.\nThis $dp[k]$ counts the number of ways to partition $1 \\dots k$ into segments $[L_j,R_j]$ with $L_j,R_j$ same parity.\nFor each such partition, we construct a tower configuration $S$ by placing towers at $i_j=(L_j+R_j)/2$.\nThe total number of such $S$ is $dp[n]$.\nFor $n=2$, $dp[2]=1$. The partition is $[1,1],[2,2]$. This leads to $S=\\{1,2\\}$, i.e., config $11$.\nThis gives $1/4$ for $n=2$. This matches the note for $n=2$.\n\nFor $n=3$, $dp[3]=2$. Probability $2/8=1/4$. This matches the note for $n=3$.\nFor $n=5$, $dp[5]=5$. Probability $5/32$. This matches the note for $n=5$.\n\nIt seems the correct formula is $F_{n+1}/2^n$.\nThe $F_k$ in my derivation is $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nSo $F_{n+1}$ is what I need.\nThe $dp[k]$ sequence is $F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5, \\dots$ for $k=0,1,2,3,4,\\dots$.\n$dp[0]=F_1=1$.\n$dp[1]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[2]=F_3=2$.\n$dp[3]=F_4=3$.\nWait, $dp[2]=1$ in my calculation. $F_3=2$.\nMy Fib sequence definitions are confusing.\nLet $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\nThen $dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]=dp[0]=1$. This is $F_2$.\n$dp[2]=dp[1]=1$. This is $F_2$.\n$dp[3]=dp[0]+dp[2]=1+1=2$. This is $F_3$.\n$dp[4]=dp[1]+dp[3]=1+2=3$. This is $F_4$.\n$dp[5]=dp[0]+dp[2]+dp[4]=1+1+3=5$. This is $F_5$.\nSo $dp[k]$ is $F_k$ for $k \\ge 3$, $dp[2]=1$, $dp[1]=1$, $dp[0]=1$.\nThis is $F_k$ shifted. $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5$.\n$dp[0]=F_1=1$.\n$dp[1]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[2]=F_2=1$.\n$dp[k]=F_k$ for $k \\ge 3$.\nThis is not a simple Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet $f(k)$ be the number of ways to partition $1 \\dots k$ into segments $[L_j, R_j]$ where $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity.\n$f(0)=1$ (empty prefix)\n$f(k) = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv k \\pmod 2}^k f(L-1)$.\nIf $k$ is odd: $L$ can be $1, 3, \\dots, k$.\n$f(k) = f(0) + f(2) + f(4) + \\dots + f(k-1)$.\nIf $k$ is even: $L$ can be $2, 4, \\dots, k$.\n$f(k) = f(1) + f(3) + f(5) + \\dots + f(k-1)$.\n\n$f(0)=1$\n$f(1) = f(0) = 1$ (odd $k=1$, $L=1$)\n$f(2) = f(1) = 1$ (even $k=2$, $L=2$)\n$f(3) = f(0) + f(2) = 1+1=2$ (odd $k=3$, $L=1,3$)\n$f(4) = f(1) + f(3) = 1+2=3$ (even $k=4$, $L=2,4$)\n$f(5) = f(0) + f(2) + f(4) = 1+1+3=5$ (odd $k=5$, $L=1,3,5$)\n$f(6) = f(1) + f(3) + f(5) = 1+2+5=8$ (even $k=6$, $L=2,4,6$)\n\nThis sequence $1,1,1,2,3,5,8$ for $k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6$.\nThis is Fibonacci sequence $F_{k+1}$ for $k \\ge 0$, but with $f(2)=1$ instead of $F_3=2$.\nLet $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13$.\n$f(0)=F_1=1$.\n$f(1)=F_2=1$.\n$f(2)=F_2=1$.\n$f(3)=F_3=2$.\n$f(4)=F_4=3$.\n$f(5)=F_5=5$.\n$f(k)=F_k$ for $k \\ge 3$.\n\nNo, this is $f(k) = F_{k+1}$ for $k \\ge 1$ if $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\n$f(1)=1=F_2$.\n$f(2)=1=F_3$.\n$f(3)=2=F_4$.\n$f(4)=3=F_5$.\n$f(5)=5=F_6$.\nSo the number of valid configurations is $F_{n+1}$.\nThis is the same conclusion as before. And it matches the notes.\nSo the answer is $F_{n+1} / 2^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's use the standard $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\nThen $F_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_2=1$.\nFor $n=2$, $F_3=2$.\nFor $n=3$, $F_4=3$.\nFor $n=5$, $F_6=8$.\n\nMy $f(k)$ sequence: $f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=2, f(4)=3, f(5)=5, f(6)=8, \\dots$.\nThis is $F_{k+1}$ if $F_0=1, F_1=1$.\nIf $F_0=1, F_1=1$, then $F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, \\dots$. This is not standard.\nUsing standard $F_0=0, F_1=1$:\n$f(0)=1$.\n$f(1)=1 \\quad (=F_2)$\n$f(2)=1 \\quad (=F_2)$\n$f(3)=2 \\quad (=F_3)$\n$f(4)=3 \\quad (=F_4)$\n$f(5)=5 \\quad (=F_5)$\nSo $f(n)$ is $F_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 1$, except $f(2)=1$ while $F_3=2$.\nThis means $f(n)$ is $F_n$ for $n \\ge 3$, where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\n$f(1)=1=F_1$.\n$f(2)=1=F_2$.\n$f(3)=2=F_3$.\n$f(4)=3=F_4$.\n$f(5)=5=F_5$.\nSo $f(n) = F_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nAnd $f(0)=1$.\nThe number of valid configurations is $f(n)$.\nIf $n=1$, $f(1)=1$. Prob $1/2$.\nIf $n=2$, $f(2)=1$. Prob $1/4$.\nIf $n=3$, $f(3)=2$. Prob $2/8=1/4$.\nIf $n=5$, $f(5)=5$. Prob $5/32$.\n\nThis is consistent with the problem notes. The output examples are wrong.\nSo I should calculate $F_n / 2^n \\pmod{998244353}$ using $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_1=1$.\nFor $n=2$, $F_2=1$.\nFor $n=3$, $F_3=2$.\nFor $n=5$, $F_5=5$.\n\nFinal algorithm:\n1.  Compute $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$ using iteration.\n    Initialize $a=0, b=1$.\n    If $n=0$, result is $0$.\n    If $n=1$, result is $1$.\n    For $i=2$ to $n$:\n        $c = (a+b) \\pmod{998244353}$\n        $a=b$\n        $b=c$\n    The value we need is $b$ (which is $F_n$).\n2.
