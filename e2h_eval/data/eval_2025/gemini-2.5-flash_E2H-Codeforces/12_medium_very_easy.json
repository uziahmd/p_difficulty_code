The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Xenia and Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. The core is about calculating the minimum time Xenia needs to complete tasks on a ring road. I've broken this down piece by piece.\n\nFirstly, I need to understand the givens: a ring road with `n` houses, `m` tasks, and Xenia's starting point and movement restrictions. The time it takes to move between houses is fixed at 1 unit of time, and Xenia must complete the tasks in a specific order. My goal is to find the minimum time to complete all `m` tasks.\n\nI've established that the initial state is `current_house = 1`, and `total_time = 0`. The heart of the problem lies in efficiently calculating the time it takes Xenia to move from her current house to the target house for each task, considering the ring road setup.\n\nFor each task, I calculate the time taken to move from `current_house` to `target_house`. The movement depends on the target house's position relative to the current house. If the `target_house` is greater than or equal to `current_house`, the calculation is a simple subtraction: `target_house - current_house`. If, however, the target house is less than the current, Xenia has to go clockwise around the ring, thus, the time is calculated as `n - current_house + target_house`.\n\nI have rigorously tested this wrap-around logic. The formula holds true for every case I've tested. After calculating the time for each task, I add it to `total_time`, and update `current_house` to the target location.\n\nNow, I've got a complete algorithm! Let's translate it into some Python code. The code should read `n`, `m`, and the list of target houses `a`. It initializes `current_house` and `total_time`, then iterates through the tasks. Inside the loop, the time calculation uses the logic I've laid out. Finally, it outputs the `total_time`. I've made sure to use efficient Python techniques such as `map` and `sys.stdin.readline` to boost performance. Time and space complexities are both O(m), making it perfect for the constraints.\n",
