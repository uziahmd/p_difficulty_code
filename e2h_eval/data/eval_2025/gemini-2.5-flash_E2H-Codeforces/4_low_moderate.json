The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing the Rock-Paper-Scissors Loss Calculation**\n\nOkay, I've got this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. The core is calculating losses, but the game goes on for a *huge* number of rounds, up to 2 billion, so brute-force simulation is out.  I've got to find a way to optimize this.\n\nThe key is that both players use repeating sequences. Nikephoros has a cycle of length `m`, and Polycarpus has one of length `k`. Since the moves are cyclic, the key is the least common multiple (`lcm`) of `m` and `k`. That's going to be the length of the repeating pattern of *combined* moves (Nikephoros's move vs. Polycarpus's move).\n\nI can calculate the LCM using the greatest common divisor.  Something like, `lcm(m, k) = (m * k) / gcd(m, k)`.  And since `m` and `k` are limited to 1000, `lcm` will also be reasonably sized (at most 1 million). This LCM value, let's call it `L`, is the period of the entire game's behavior.\n\nSo, here's the plan: I'll simulate a single cycle of `L` rounds. Within that cycle, I'll carefully track how many times Nikephoros loses and how many times Polycarpus loses. Let's call these losses `nike_losses_cycle` and `poly_losses_cycle`.\n\nThen, I'll calculate how many *full* cycles of length `L` are in the total game length `n`. That's just `n // L`. The number of full cycles will be multiplied by the respective cycle losses.\n\nFinally, I need to account for the remaining rounds: `n % L`. I'll explicitly simulate these remaining rounds (which will be at most `L-1`) and add their losses to the totals from the full cycles.  That way, even though I have `n` rounds, the simulation effort will be limited by the *relatively* small `L`. This should give me the correct result without exceeding the time limit. Sounds good.\n",
