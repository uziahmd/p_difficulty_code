The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent).

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Radio Tower Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving radio towers. The goal is to figure out the probability of a valid tower configuration, modulo 998244353. It seems like the core challenge is in understanding and satisfying the constraints.\n\nFirst off, I've got this setup: towns numbered from 0 to n+1, with towers potentially in towns 1 to n. Towers are built randomly with a 50% chance each. When a tower is built at town *i*, I need to assign it a signal power *p* from 1 to *n*.\n\nNow, the crucial part: a tower's range is defined by *|c - i| < p*.  This means the signal from town *i* with power *p* covers towns from *i - p + 1* to *i + p - 1*.  I need to ensure that towns 0 and n+1 don't receive any signal, and importantly, each of towns 1 through n *must* be covered by *exactly one* tower.\n\nLet's break down those constraints. For town 0 to be uncovered, the power *p* of a tower at *i* must be such that *i - p + 1 > 0*, meaning *p <= i*. Similarly, for town *n+1* not to be covered, *i + p - 1 < n+1*, so *p <= n+1 - i*.  Combining these, the valid range for *p* is *1 <= p <= min(i, n+1-i)*. This ensures no signal leaks beyond town 0 and n+1.\n\nThe second constraint is the real puzzle. I have to make sure that each town from 1 to *n* is reached by one and only one tower. This means the coverage intervals, [i - p + 1, i + p - 1], for each active tower must form a non-overlapping partition of the interval [1, n]. It seems like ensuring they don't overlap is key.\nSo, I'm thinking I need to find a way to enumerate valid combinations of tower placements and power levels that satisfy this \"exactly one\" coverage constraint, and then calculate the probability. I think a dynamic programming approach might be useful. The fact that the ranges must not overlap seems like a key property to build into the state definition for a DP solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that, given a random selection of towns for radio tower placement, we can assign signal powers such that:\n1.  Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.\n2.  Towns $1, \\dots, n$ receive signal from exactly one tower.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nIf a tower is built at town $i$ with signal power $p_i$, it covers towns $c$ such that $|c - i| < p_i$. This means towns in the interval $[i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]$ are covered.\n\n**Constraint 1: Towns $0$ and $n+1$ receive no signal.**\nFor a tower at $i$ with power $p_i$:\n*   Town $0$ is not covered: $i - p_i + 1 > 0 \\implies p_i \\le i$.\n*   Town $n+1$ is not covered: $i + p_i - 1 < n+1 \\implies p_i \\le n+1 - i$.\nCombining these, $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nThis implies that the coverage interval $[i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]$ is always contained within $[1, n]$.\n\n**Constraint 2: Towns $1, \\dots, n$ receive signal from exactly one tower each.**\nThis means the union of all coverage intervals $[i - p_i + 1, i + p_i - 1]$ for $i \\in S$ must exactly cover $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, and these intervals must be disjoint.\n\nLet's consider the possible values for $p_i$.\nIf $p_i = 1$, the tower at $i$ covers only town $i$.\nIf $p_i = k$, the tower at $i$ covers towns $[i-k+1, i+k-1]$. The length of this interval is $2k-1$.\n\nConsider the structure required for the disjoint coverage. If we have towers at $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_m$, their coverage intervals $[i_j - p_{i_j} + 1, i_j + p_{i_j} - 1]$ must partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis means that for any two adjacent towers $i_j, i_{j+1} \\in S$, their coverage intervals must \"meet\" exactly:\n$i_j + p_{i_j} - 1 = i_{j+1} - p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nAlso, the first tower $i_1$ must cover up to $1$: $i_1 - p_{i_1} + 1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1} = i_1$.\nAnd the last tower $i_m$ must cover up to $n$: $i_m + p_{i_m} - 1 = n \\implies p_{i_m} = n+1 - i_m$.\n\nIf $p_i = i$, then $i - p_i + 1 = 1$. The interval is $[1, 2i-1]$.\nIf $p_i = n+1-i$, then $i + p_i - 1 = n$. The interval is $[2i-n, n]$.\nThese are the maximum possible powers for $i$ to cover $1$ or $n$ respectively.\n\nLet's analyze the condition $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nIf $p_i = i$, then $i \\le n+1-i \\implies 2i \\le n+1 \\implies i \\le \\lfloor (n+1)/2 \\rfloor$.\nIf $p_i = n+1-i$, then $n+1-i \\le i \\implies n+1 \\le 2i \\implies i \\ge \\lceil (n+1)/2 \\rceil$.\n\nThis means if a tower $i$ covers town $1$, it must be $i \\le \\lfloor (n+1)/2 \\rfloor$.\nIf a tower $i$ covers town $n$, it must be $i \\ge \\lceil (n+1)/2 \\rceil$.\n\nConsider the \"middle\" of the range $[1, n]$.\nIf $n$ is odd, say $n=2k+1$, the middle town is $k+1$.\nIf $n$ is even, say $n=2k$, the middle towns are $k, k+1$.\n\n**Case 1: $n$ is odd.** Let $n=2k+1$. The \"middle\" town is $k+1$.\nA tower at $i$ can cover $1$ if $i \\le k+1$.\nA tower at $i$ can cover $n$ if $i \\ge k+1$.\nSo, only a tower at $k+1$ can cover both $1$ and $n$ (by setting $p_{k+1}=k+1$).\nIf a tower is at $k+1$ and $p_{k+1}=k+1$, it covers $[1, 2(k+1)-1] = [1, 2k+1] = [1, n]$.\nIn this case, only town $k+1$ can have a tower, and it must have $p_{k+1}=k+1$. All other towns $i \\ne k+1$ must not have towers.\nThis configuration is valid if $S = \\{k+1\\}$. The probability is $(1/2)^1 \\cdot (1/2)^{n-1} = (1/2)^n$.\n\n**Case 2: $n$ is even.** Let $n=2k$. The \"middle\" towns are $k$ and $k+1$.\nA tower at $i$ can cover $1$ if $i \\le k$.\nA tower at $i$ can cover $n$ if $i \\ge k+1$.\nIn this case, no single tower can cover both $1$ and $n$. So, there must be at least two towers.\nThe first tower $i_1$ must satisfy $p_{i_1}=i_1$. This requires $i_1 \\le k$.\nThe last tower $i_m$ must satisfy $p_{i_m}=n+1-i_m$. This requires $i_m \\ge k+1$.\nThis implies that there must be at least one tower $i_j \\le k$ and at least one tower $i_l \\ge k+1$.\n\nConsider the \"meeting points\" of the intervals. If $p_i = i$ for a tower at $i$, it covers $[1, 2i-1]$. If $p_j = n+1-j$ for a tower at $j$, it covers $[2j-n, n]$.\nFor a valid configuration, the set of towns $S$ must be such that we can assign powers $p_i \\in [1, \\min(i, n+1-i)]$ to cover $[1, n]$ disjointly.\nThis implies that for any $i \\in S$, the interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ must be \"centered\" at $i$.\nThe length of the interval is $2p_i-1$.\nThe midpoint of the interval is $i$.\nThe set of covered towns is $C = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe union of intervals must be $C$.\nThe intervals must be disjoint.\nThis implies that the *endpoints* of the intervals must be consecutive integers.\nFor example, if we have towers at $i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_m$:\n$[i_1-p_{i_1}+1, i_1+p_{i_1}-1]$, $[i_2-p_{i_2}+1, i_2+p_{i_2}-1]$, ...\nThe conditions are:\n1. $i_1-p_{i_1}+1 = 1$\n2. $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ for $j=1, \\dots, m-1$\n3. $i_m+p_{i_m}-1 = n$\n\nFrom these, we can derive $p_{i_1} = i_1$, $p_{i_m} = n+1-i_m$.\nAnd for $j=1, \\dots, m-1$: $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1} - i_j + 1$.\nThis means $p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1} - i_j + 1 - p_{i_j}$.\nSubstituting this into the constraint $p_{i_{j+1}} \\le \\min(i_{j+1}, n+1-i_{j+1})$ is complicated.\n\nLet's look at the problem from a different angle. What if we fix the powers?\nIf all $p_i=1$, then $S$ must be $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The probability is $(1/2)^n$.\nThis is always a valid configuration.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the required $S$.\nThe problem states that any $i \\in S$ must satisfy $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nIf $p_i = 1$, then town $i$ is covered by tower $i$.\nIf $p_i = k > 1$, then towns $i-k+1, \\dots, i+k-1$ are covered.\nThis means that if a tower at $i$ has $p_i > 1$, then towns $i-1$ and $i+1$ (if they are within $[1,n]$) must also be covered by tower $i$. This implies that $i-1 \\notin S$ and $i+1 \\notin S$.\nSo, if a tower $i$ has $p_i > 1$, then towns $i-1$ and $i+1$ cannot have towers.\nThis is a key observation. If $i \\in S$ and $p_i>1$, then $i-1 \\notin S$ and $i+1 \\notin S$.\nIf $i \\in S$ and $p_i=1$, then $i-1$ and $i+1$ can be in $S$.\n\nConsider the set of towns $S$ where towers are built.\nIf $i \\in S$ and $i-1 \\in S$, then $p_i=1$ and $p_{i-1}=1$. (Otherwise, if $p_i>1$, $i-1$ cannot be in $S$. If $p_{i-1}>1$, $i$ cannot be in $S$).\nThis implies that if we have a contiguous block of towers $j, j+1, \\dots, k$, then all these towers must have power $1$.\nThe coverage intervals are $[j,j], [j+1,j+1], \\dots, [k,k]$.\nThese cover towns $j, \\dots, k$.\nFor this to fit into the overall scheme, we need $j-1 \\notin S$ (if $j>1$) and $k+1 \\notin S$ (if $k<n$).\nAnd the tower at $j$ must cover town $j$ (so $p_j=1 \\le \\min(j, n+1-j)$).\nAnd the tower at $k$ must cover town $k$ (so $p_k=1 \\le \\min(k, n+1-k)$).\n\nNow, consider a tower $i \\in S$ such that $i-1 \\notin S$ and $i+1 \\notin S$.\nThis tower $i$ can have $p_i > 1$.\nThe interval covered by $i$ is $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nThe towns $i-1, i+1$ are not in $S$. They must be covered by tower $i$.\nThis implies $i-p_i+1 \\le i-1$ and $i+p_i-1 \\ge i+1$.\nBoth conditions require $p_i \\ge 2$.\n\nSo, any valid set $S$ of towers must have the property:\nFor any $i \\in S$, if $i-1 \\in S$ or $i+1 \\in S$, then $p_i=1$.\nIf $i \\in S$ and $i-1 \\notin S$ and $i+1 \\notin S$, then $p_i$ can be $>1$.\n\nLet's rephrase: if $i \\in S$, and $i$ is not adjacent to another tower in $S$, then $p_i \\ge 2$.\nIf $i \\in S$, and $i$ is adjacent to another tower in $S$, then $p_i = 1$.\n\nConsider the structure of $S$. It can be a sequence of isolated towers and blocks of consecutive towers.\nExample: $S=\\{2, 4, 5\\}$. $n=5$.\n$2$ is isolated. $p_2 \\ge 2$. $p_2 \\le \\min(2, 5+1-2) = \\min(2,4)=2$. So $p_2=2$. Covers $[1,3]$.\n$4,5$ is a block. $p_4=1, p_5=1$. Covers $[4,4], [5,5]$.\nTotal coverage: $[1,3] \\cup [4,4] \\cup [5,5] = [1,5]$. This is valid.\n\nThis implies that the set $S$ must be such that:\n1.  If $i \\in S$ and $i-1 \\in S$, then $p_i=1$ (and $p_{i-1}=1$).\n2.  If $i \\in S$ and $i+1 \\in S$, then $p_i=1$ (and $p_{i+1}=1$).\n3.  If $i \\in S$, $i-1 \\notin S$ and $i+1 \\notin S$: then $p_i \\ge 2$.\n    The towns $i-1$ and $i+1$ must be covered by $i$.\n    This means $i-p_i+1 \\le i-1 \\implies p_i \\ge 2$.\n    And $i+p_i-1 \\ge i+1 \\implies p_i \\ge 2$.\n    So, for an isolated tower $i$, $p_i$ must be at least $2$.\n\nLet's define $S_0 = \\{i \\in S \\mid i-1 \\notin S \\text{ and } i+1 \\notin S\\}$ (isolated towers).\nLet $S_1 = \\{i \\in S \\mid i-1 \\in S \\text{ or } i+1 \\in S\\}$ (towers adjacent to another tower).\nFor $i \\in S_1$, $p_i=1$.\nFor $i \\in S_0$, $p_i \\ge 2$.\nThe coverage intervals for $i \\in S_1$ are $[i,i]$.\nThe coverage intervals for $i \\in S_0$ are $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\n\nThe crucial point is that if we have a set $S$ where towers are built, and it satisfies the conditions for $p_i$ (i.e., $p_i=1$ for $i \\in S_1$ and $p_i \\ge 2$ for $i \\in S_0$), can we always find a set of powers?\nThe problem requires that towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from *exactly one* tower.\nThis means the intervals must be disjoint and cover $[1, n]$.\nFor $i \\in S_1$, the intervals are $[i,i]$. These are disjoint and cover exactly $S_1$.\nFor $i \\in S_0$, the intervals are $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$. These must cover $C \\setminus S_1$.\nAlso, for $i \\in S_0$, $i-1 \\notin S$ and $i+1 \\notin S$.\nSo the intervals $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ must cover $i-1$ and $i+1$.\nThis implies $p_i \\ge 2$.\n\nThe problem states \"you will have a way to set signal powers\". This suggests that if *any* valid assignment exists, we count it.\nThe conditions derived above ( $p_i=1$ for adjacent, $p_i \\ge 2$ for isolated) are necessary.\nLet's see if they are sufficient.\nConsider the towns not in $S$. These are $C \\setminus S$.\nThese towns must be covered by towers in $S_0$.\nIf $j \\notin S$, then $j$ must be covered by some $i \\in S_0$.\nThis means $i-p_i+1 \\le j \\le i+p_i-1$.\nAlso, $j$ cannot be covered by any $k \\in S_1$ because $k \\in S_1 \\implies k \\in S$, and $k$ only covers itself.\nSo, the set $S_1$ covers itself. The set $S_0$ must cover $C \\setminus S$.\nThe intervals for $i \\in S_0$ must be disjoint from each other and from $S_1$.\nThis means for $i \\in S_0$, the interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ must contain $i$ but must not contain any $j \\in S_1$ except possibly $i$ itself (but $i \\in S_0$ so $i \\notin S_1$).\nSo, for $i \\in S_0$, the interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ must not contain any $j \\in S_1$.\nThis means $p_i$ must be chosen such that $i-p_i+1 > j$ or $i+p_i-1 < j$ for all $j \\in S_1$.\nThis is equivalent to saying that the interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ must contain only towns that are not in $S$.\nThis is not true. It must contain $i$ and $i \\in S_0$, so $i \\notin S_1$.\nThe union of intervals must be exactly $[1, n]$, and they must be disjoint.\nThis means that for any $i \\in S_0$, its interval must cover $i$ and some towns not in $S$.\nSpecifically, the interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ must consist *entirely* of towns that are not in $S$, except for $i$ itself.\nThis means that for any $i \\in S_0$, $i-1 \\notin S$, $i+1 \\notin S$.\nIf $i-2 \\in S$, then $i-2$ must be covered by $i-2$ (so $p_{i-2}=1$).\nThis implies that $i-p_i+1$ must be $i-1$ or $i-2$ or ...\nThis means the interval for $i \\in S_0$ must be $[L, R]$ where $L, R \\notin S$.\nBut $i$ itself is in $S$.\nThis is confusing. Let's restart with a simpler formulation.\n\nThe conditions are:\n1.  For each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there is exactly one $i \\in S$ such that $j \\in [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\n2.  For each $i \\in S$, $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\nConsider the effect of a tower at $i$ with power $p_i$. It covers $2p_i-1$ towns.\nThe total number of covered towns must be $n$.\nSo $\\sum_{i \\in S} (2p_i-1) = n$.\n\nLet's look at the example $n=5$, $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$.\n$p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1$.\n$p_2 \\le \\min(2, 6-2) = 2$.\n$p_4 \\le \\min(4, 6-4) = 2$.\n$p_5 \\le \\min(5, 6-5) = 1$.\nAll constraints on $p_i$ are satisfied.\n$\\sum (2p_i-1) = (2 \\cdot 2 - 1) + (2 \\cdot 1 - 1) + (2 \\cdot 1 - 1) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 = n$.\nThis is a valid configuration.\n\nThe condition \"exactly one tower\" means that the intervals must partition $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis means that for any $i \\in S$, its interval $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ must not overlap with any other tower's interval.\nThis implies $i-p_i+1$ must be $1$ or $j+p_j-1+1$ for some $j \\in S$.\nAnd $i+p_i-1$ must be $n$ or $j-p_j+1-1$ for some $j \\in S$.\n\nThis is the condition for a perfect tiling of the interval $[1,n]$ using \"centered\" segments.\nThe only way this can happen is if the towers are placed such that they form a \"recursive\" structure.\nFor example, if $S=\\{k\\}$, then $p_k=k$ must hold (if $k \\le n+1-k$) or $p_k=n+1-k$ (if $k \\ge n+1-k$).\nIf $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$, then $k+1$ is the midpoint. If $S=\\{k+1\\}$, $p_{k+1}=k+1$. This covers $[1, n]$. This is valid. $P=(1/2)^n$.\nIf $n$ is even, $n=2k$, then $k, k+1$ are midpoints. No single tower can cover $[1,n]$.\nIf $S=\\{k, k+1\\}$, then $p_k=k$ and $p_{k+1}=k$. This covers $[1, 2k-1]$ and $[2, 2k]$. No, this is not disjoint.\nThe intervals must be $p_k=k$ for $[1,k]$ and $p_{k+1}=k$ for $[k+1,n]$.\nThis means $p_k=k$ covers $[1, 2k-1]$. $p_{k+1}=k$ covers $[k+1-k+1, k+1+k-1] = [2, 2k]$.\nThis is not disjoint.\n\nThe key insight for this type of problem is often related to Fibonacci numbers or similar sequences.\nConsider the structure of a valid partition.\nLet $f(k)$ be the number of ways to tile $[1, k]$ using such segments.\nA segment $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$ for tower $i$ has length $2p_i-1$.\nThe first segment must start at $1$. So $i_1-p_{i_1}+1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1}=i_1$.\nThe segment is $[1, 2i_1-1]$.\nIf $2i_1-1 = n$, then $i_1=(n+1)/2$. This is possible only if $n$ is odd.\nIf $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$, then $i_1=k+1$. This segment covers $[1, n]$.\nIn this case, $S=\\{k+1\\}$. Probability $(1/2)^n$.\nWhat if $2i_1-1 < n$? Then we need to tile the remaining interval $[2i_1, n]$.\nThe next tower $i_2$ must cover $2i_1$. So $i_2-p_{i_2}+1 = 2i_1$.\nThis is like a recursive problem.\nThe towns $i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_m$ must be in $S$.\nThe conditions are:\n1. $p_{i_1} = i_1$\n2. $p_{i_m} = n+1-i_m$\n3. $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1} - i_j + 1$ for $j=1, \\dots, m-1$.\nAnd for all $j$, $1 \\le p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\n\nLet $dp[k]$ be the number of valid tower configurations for towns $1, \\dots, k$.\nThe first tower $i_1$ is at $x$. It has power $x$. It covers $[1, 2x-1]$.\nThis means $x \\in S$.\nIf $2x-1 = k$, then $S=\\{x\\}$ is a valid configuration for $k$.\nIf $2x-1 < k$, then $S=\\{x\\} \\cup S'$, where $S'$ is a valid configuration for $[2x, k]$.\nThis is not quite right because the conditions $p_j \\le \\min(j, n+1-j)$ depend on $n$.\nThe $n$ in the problem is fixed. So $dp[k]$ is not enough.\n\nLet $a_n$ be the number of valid tower configurations for a given $n$.\nIf $n=1$: $S=\\{1\\}$. $p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$.

Invalid.\nWhat about $S=\\{1,2\\}$? $p_1=1, p_2=1$. Covers $[1,2]$. $3,4$ not covered.\nWhat about $S=\\{1,4\\}$? $p_1=1, p_4=1$. Covers $[1,1]$ and $[4,4]$. $2,3$ not covered.\nWhat about $S=\\{2,3\\}$? $p_2=1, p_3=1$. Covers $[2,3]$. $1,4$ not covered.\nThere must be a tower $i_1$ with $p_{i_1}=i_1$ and a tower $i_m$ with $p_{i_m}=n+1-i_m$.\nFor $n=4$:\n$i_1=1 \\implies p_1=1$. Covers $[1,1]$. Remaining: $[2,4]$.\n$i_m=4 \\implies p_4=1$. Covers $[4,4]$. Remaining: $[1,3]$.\nIf $S=\\{1,4\\}$, $p_1=1, p_4=1$. $p_2+p_3 = 4-1+1=4$. But $p_2, p_3$ are not defined.\nThis means for $S=\\{1,4\\}$, towns $2,3$ are not covered.\nThe only way to cover $2,3$ is to have a tower in $S$ that covers them.\nIf $S=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, $p_i=1$ for all $i$. Valid.\nIf $S=\\{1,3,4\\}$? $p_1=1, p_3=1, p_4=1$.

All $p_i=1$. Valid.\n$S=\\{3\\}$. $p_3=3$. Covers $[1,5]$. Valid.\n$S=\\{2,4,5\\}$. $p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1$. Valid.\n$S=\\{1,2,4\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_4=2$. Valid.\n$a_5=4$.\n\nSequence of $a_n$: $1, 1, 2, 1, 4$. This does not look like Fibonacci.\nThe example for $n=5$ says $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$ with $p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1$.\nThis covers $[1,3]$, $[4,4]$, $[5,5]$.\nThis is a valid configuration.\nThe total number of ways to choose towers is $2^n$. We need to count the number of valid $S$.\nThe number of valid $S$ for $n=1, \\dots, 5$ are $1, 1, 2, 3, 5$.\n$a_1=1$, $a_2=1$, $a_3=2$, $a_4=3$, $a_5=5$.\nThis is Fibonacci sequence $F_{n+1}$ where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\nSo $a_n = F_{n+1}$.\n\nLet's prove this.\nLet $A_n$ be the set of valid tower configurations for $n$.\nA configuration $S \\in A_n$ must satisfy the disjoint covering conditions.\nConsider the first town $1$. It must be covered by some tower $i \\in S$.\nThis means $i-p_i+1=1 \\implies p_i=i$.\nThis implies $i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$, so $i \\le n+1-i \\implies 2i \\le n+1 \\implies i \\le \\lfloor (n+1)/2 \\rfloor$.\nThe tower $i$ covers $[1, 2i-1]$.\nCase 1: $2i-1 = n$.\nThis means $i=(n+1)/2$. This is only possible if $n$ is odd.\nIf $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$, then $i=k+1$.\nIn this case, $S=\\{k+1\\}$ is the only tower. The power $p_{k+1}=k+1$.\nThis configuration is valid.\nThere is only 1 such configuration.\nThe remaining towns $1, \\dots, 2i-2$ must be covered by other towers.\nNo, if $2i-1=n$, then the *entire* interval $[1,n]$ is covered by this single tower at $i$.\nSo $S=\\{i\\}$, where $i=(n+1)/2$. This is one valid configuration, only if $n$ is odd.\n\nCase 2: $2i-1 < n$.\nThe tower $i$ covers $[1, 2i-1]$.\nThe remaining interval $[2i, n]$ must be covered by other towers $S' \\subseteq \\{i+1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe conditions for $S'$ covering $[2i, n]$ are:\n1.  For each $j \\in \\{2i, \\dots, n\\}$, exactly one tower $k \\in S'$ covers $j$.\n2.  For each $k \\in S'$, $p_k \\le \\min(k, n+1-k)$.\nAlso, the tower at $i$ must not overlap with $S'$.\nThe tower at $i$ has $p_i=i$.\nThe towers in $S'$ must start covering from $2i$.\nLet $j_1$ be the smallest tower in $S'$.\nThen $j_1-p_{j_1}+1 = 2i$.\nAlso, $p_{j_1}$ must be chosen such that $p_{j_1} + p_i = j_1-i+1$.\n$p_{j_1} = j_1-i+1-i = j_1-2i+1$.\nThis implies $j_1-2i+1 \\le \\min(j_1, n+1-j_1)$.\nThe problem is that the $p_k \\le \\min(k, n+1-k)$ condition depends on the global $n$.\nThis suggests that the structure must be simpler.\n\nThe condition $p_j+p_{j+1} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$ is equivalent to $p_j+p_{j+1} = \\text{distance between towers} + 1$.\nThis means that the sum of radii $p_j+p_{j+1}$ must exactly bridge the gap between $i_j$ and $i_{j+1}$.\nThe length of the interval covered by $i_j$ is $2p_{i_j}-1$.\nThe length of the interval covered by $i_{j+1}$ is $2p_{i_{j+1}}-1$.\nThe distance between midpoints $i_{j+1}-i_j$.\nThe sum of half-lengths is $p_{i_j} + p_{i_{j+1}}$.\nThe total length covered by $i_j$ and $i_{j+1}$ is $(i_j+p_{i_j}-1) - (i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}+1) + 1$.\nThis is $i_j+p_{i_j}-i_{j+1}+p_{i_{j+1}}-1$.\nThe condition $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ means $p_{i_j}+p_{i_{j+1}} = i_{j+1}-i_j+1$.\nThis is a standard condition for intervals to perfectly tile a segment.\n\nLet $S$ be a set of towns where towers are built.\nA tower $i \\in S$ can either have $p_i=1$ (covering $[i,i]$) or $p_i>1$.\nIf $p_i>1$, then $i-1 \\notin S$ and $i+1 \\notin S$.\nThis means that if we have a set $S$, we can classify its elements:\n*   $i \\in S$ is *isolated* if $i-1 \\notin S$ and $i+1 \\notin S$. (For $i=1$, $1 \\notin S$ means $1-1=0 \\notin S$. For $i=n$, $n+1 \\notin S$ means $n+1 \\notin S$.)\n*   $i \\in S$ is *adjacent* if $i-1 \\in S$ or $i+1 \\in S$.\n\nIf $i$ is adjacent, then $p_i=1$. The interval is $[i,i]$.\nIf $i$ is isolated, then $p_i>1$. The interval is $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$. This interval must cover $i-1$ and $i+1$.\nSo $p_i \\ge 2$.\n\nConsider the structure of $S$. It must be a set of disjoint maximal blocks of consecutive integers.\nE.g., $S = \\{1,2,3\\} \\cup \\{5\\} \\cup \\{7,8\\}$.\nFor $\\{1,2,3\\}$, $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$. Covers $[1,2,3]$.\nFor $\\{5\\}$, $p_5 \\ge 2$. It must cover $4$ and $6$.\nFor $\\{7,8\\}$, $p_7=1, p_8=1$. Covers $[7,8]$.\n\nThis implies that the *gaps* between blocks must be covered by isolated towers.\nLet $S = B_1 \\cup I_1 \\cup B_2 \\cup I_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup B_m$.\nWhere $B_j$ are blocks of consecutive towers (all $p=1$).\nAnd $I_j$ are isolated towers (all $p \\ge 2$).\nThis means that $S$ must be a set of towers $S = \\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_m\\}$ such that for each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there exists exactly one $k$ such that $j \\in [i_k - p_{i_k} + 1, i_k + p_{i_k} - 1]$.\nAnd $p_{i_k} \\le \\min(i_k, n+1-i_k)$.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to counting the number of ways to tile an interval of length $n$ with blocks of length $1$ (a tower $i$ with $p_i=1$) and blocks of length $2k-1$ (a tower $i$ with $p_i=k$).\nThe condition $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ means that the center $i$ of a block of length $2p_i-1$ must be such that $p_i$ is within bounds.\nFor a block of length $1$, $p_i=1$. This is always valid for $i \\in [1,n]$.\nFor a block of length $2k-1$, $p_i=k$. This means $i$ must be such that $k \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nIf we tile $[1,n]$ with segments of length $1$ and segments of length $2k-1$ for $k \\ge 2$.\nA segment of length $1$ corresponds to $i \\in S$ and $p_i=1$.\nA segment of length $2k-1$ for $k \\ge 2$ corresponds to $i \\in S$ and $p_i=k$.\nThe center of a length $1$ segment is $i$.\nThe center of a length $2k-1$ segment is $i$.\nIn the Fibonacci tiling problem, you tile with segments of length $1$ and $2$.\nHere, we can tile with segments of length $1$ and segments of length $3, 5, \\dots$.\nLet $a_n$ be the number of ways to tile the interval $[1,n]$ using segments of length $1$ and segments of length $L \\ge 3$ (where $L$ is odd).\nA segment of length $1$ corresponds to a tower $i$ with $p_i=1$. $i$ is in $S$.\nA segment of length $L=2k-1$ ($k \\ge 2$) corresponds to a tower $i$ with $p_i=k$. $i$ is in $S$.\nThe condition $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ must be satisfied for all towers.\nIf $p_i=1$, $1 \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ is always true.\nIf $p_i=k \\ge 2$, then $k \\le i$ and $k \\le n+1-i$.\nThis means $i \\ge k$ and $i \\le n+1-k$.\nThe center $i$ of a segment of length $2k-1$ must be in $[k, n+1-k]$.\n\nLet $dp[j]$ be the number of ways to tile the prefix $[1, j]$ such that all conditions are met for the towers in this prefix, and the last tower ends at $j$.\nThis is not quite right.\nLet $f(j)$ be the number of ways to tile the interval $[1, j]$ using segments of length $1$ and segments of odd length $L \\ge 3$, such that the center of an $L$-segment at $i$ is within $[L/2, j-(L/2)+1]$.\nThis is essentially the number of ways to tile $[1, j]$ with segments of length $1$ or $2k-1$.\nLet $dp[j]$ be the number of ways to tile the interval $[1, j]$.\nTo tile $[1, j]$:\n1.  Place a segment of length $1$ at $j$. This covers $j$. The remaining interval is $[1, j-1]$. Number of ways: $dp[j-1]$.\n2.  Place a segment of length $L=2k-1$ at $j-(k-1)$. This covers $[j-2k+1, j]$.\n    The remaining interval is $[1, j-2k]$. Number of ways: $dp[j-2k]$.\nThis is a standard recurrence for Fibonacci numbers. $dp[j] = dp[j-1] + dp[j-2]$ if only length $1$ and $2$ segments are allowed.\nHere, we have length $1$ and lengths $3, 5, \\dots$.\nLet $g(j)$ be the number of ways to partition $[1,j]$ into valid segments.\n$g(0)=1$ (empty interval).\nTo tile $[1,j]$:\n*   The last segment has length $1$. It covers $[j,j]$. The center is $j$. $p_j=1$. This is valid. $g(j-1)$ ways.\n*   The last segment has length $L=2k-1$ where $k \\ge 2$. It covers $[j-L+1, j]$. The center is $j-(k-1)$. $p_{j-(k-1)}=k$.\n    This requires $k \\le j-(k-1)$ and $k \\le n+1-(j-(k-1))$.\n    The first condition $k \\le j-k+1 \\implies 2k-1 \\le j$. This is $L \\le j$.\n    The second condition $k \\le n+1-j+k-1 \\implies j \\le n$. This is always true for $j \\le n$.\n    So, $g(j) = g(j-1) + \\sum_{k=2}^{j/2+1} g(j-(2k-1))$.\n    This is $g(j) = g(j-1) + g(j-3) + g(j-5) + \\dots$.\n    $g(j) = g(j-1) + (g(j-3) + g(j-5) + \\dots)$.\n    Note that $g(j-1) = g(j-2) + (g(j-4) + g(j-6) + \\dots)$.\n    So $g(j) = g(j-1) + g(j-2) - g(j-4)$? No.\n    $g(j) = g(j-1) + g(j-3) + g(j-5) + \\dots + g(1)$ (if $j$ is odd) or $g(0)$ (if $j$ is even).\n    $g(j-1) = g(j-2) + g(j-4) + \\dots$.\n    This gives $g(j) = g(j-1) + g(j-2)$.\n    Base cases:\n    $g(0)=1$.\n    $g(1)$: last segment length 1. $g(0)=1$. So $g(1)=1$.\n    $g(2)$: last segment length 1. $g(1)=1$. No odd length $\\ge 3$. So $g(2)=1$.\n    $g(3)$: last segment length 1. $g(2)=1$. Last segment length 3. $g(0)=1$. So $g(3)=1+1=2$.\n    $g(4)$: last segment length 1. $g(3)=2$. No odd length $\\ge 3$ ending at $4$. Length 3 segment at $2$. $g(1)=1$. So $g(4)=2+1=3$.\n    $g(5)$: last segment length 1. $g(4)=3$. Length 3 segment at $3$. $g(2)=1$. Length 5 segment at $3$. $g(0)=1$. So $g(5)=3+1+1=5$.\n\nThis sequence $1, 1, 2, 3, 5$ matches $F_{n+1}$.\nSo the number of ways to set towers is $F_{n+1}$.\nThe total number of ways to build towers is $2^n$.\nThe probability is $F_{n+1} / 2^n$.\n\nWe need to calculate $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThe modulus $M = 998244353$ is a prime number.\nWe need to calculate $F_{n+1}$ using matrix exponentiation or a linear recurrence.\n$F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}$.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} F_k \\\\ F_{k-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe need $F_{n+1}$.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} \\\\ F_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nLet's compute $F_{n+1}$.\n$N=2 \\cdot 10^5$. Matrix exponentiation is $O(\\log N)$.\nModular inverse for $2^n$ is $2^{n(M-2)} \\pmod M$.\n\nExample $n=2$: $F_3 = 2$. Probability $2/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$.\nOutput: $748683265$.\n$1/2 \\pmod{998244353} = (998244353+1)/2 = 499122177$.\nMy $n=2$ example output is different from problem example.\nProblem says $n=2$, output $748683265$.\nThe real answer for $n=2$ is $1/4$.\nMy sequence $a_n$ is $F_{n+1}$.\n$a_1=1$. $F_2=1$.\n$a_2=1$. $F_3=2$.\n$a_3=2$. $F_4=3$.\n$a_4=3$. $F_5=5$.\n$a_5=5$. $F_6=8$.\n\nThe example outputs $1/4$ for $n=2$.\nThis means $a_2=1$. But my $F_3=2$.\nThe example outputs $1/4$ for $n=3$.\nThis means $a_3=2$. My $F_4=3$.\nThe example outputs $5/32$ for $n=5$.\nThis means $a_5=5$. My $F_6=8$.\n\nMy Fibonacci sequence $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$.\nSo my $a_n$ is $F_{n+1}$.\n$a_1=F_2=1$. Probability $1/2^1 = 1/2$. Example output $748683265$ (which is $1/2$). This matches.\n$a_2=F_3=2$. Probability $2/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$. Example output $748683265$. This matches.\n$a_3=F_4=3$. Probability $3/2^3 = 3/8$.

No, this does not match.\n$8^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$: $998244353 = 124780544 \\cdot 8 + 1$. So $1 = 998244353 - 124780544 \\cdot 8$.\n$8^{-1} = -124780544 \\equiv 873463809 \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$3 \\cdot 873463809 = 2620391427 \\equiv 624102047 \\pmod{998244353}$. Still not matching.\n\nLet's recheck example $n=3$. Output is $842268673$.\nThe note says: \"with probability $1/8$, the towers are built in towns $1,2,3$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$; with probability $1/8$, only one tower in town $2$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $2$.\"\nThis means there are 2 valid configurations for $n=3$.\n$S=\\{1,2,3\\}$ with $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$.\n$S=\\{2\\}$ with $p_2=2$. Covers $[1,3]$.\nThese are the only two valid configurations for $n=3$.\nSo $a_3=2$.\nThe total number of configurations is $2^3=8$.\nProbability is $2/8 = 1/4$.\n$1/4 \\pmod{998244353} = 249561089$.\nThis is NOT $842268673$.\n\nWhat is going on? The problem statement says \"The real answer for the first example is $1/4$\". My $n=2$ calculation gives $1/2$.\nWait, the example input is `2`, `3`, `5`, `200000`.\nThe first example is $n=2$. Output $748683265$.\nThe note says \"The real answer for the first example is $1/4$\". This is confusing.\n$748683265 \\pmod{998244353}$ is $1/2$.\n$1/4 \\pmod{998244353}$ is $249561089$.\nSo the example output for $n=2$ is $1/2$, but the note says $1/4$. This is a contradiction in the problem statement.\nLet's assume the output values are correct.\nFor $n=2$, output $1/2$. This means $a_2=2$.\nFor $n=3$, output $1/4$. This means $a_3=2$.\nFor $n=5$, output $5/32$. This means $a_5=5$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate $a_n$ based on example outputs:\n$n=1$: Not given in example.\n$n=2$: $a_2=2$. My $F_3=2$. This matches.\n$n=3$: $a_3=2$. My $F_4=3$. This does NOT match.\n$n=5$: $a_5=5$. My $F_6=8$.

What is the third one?\nThe $F_{n+1}$ recurrence is for tiling an interval $[1,n]$ with segments of length $1$ and segments of odd length $L \\ge 3$.\nFor $n=3$:\n1. $L=1, L=1, L=1$. Towers at $1,2,3$. $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$. Valid.\n2. $L=3$. Tower at $2$. $p_2=2$. Valid.\nThis gives $a_3=2$. My $F_4=3$ is incorrect.\nWhat is the error in $F_4=3$?\n$g(0)=1, g(1)=1, g(2)=1, g(3)=2$.\n$g(4)$:\nLast segment length 1: $g(3)=2$.

(Tower at $1,3$ with $p_1=1, p_3=2$).\nSo $g(4)=2+1=3$.\nThis $F_{n+1}$ sequence IS correct.\nSo for $n=3$, $a_3=F_4=3$.\nThe examples' note for $n=3$ explicitly lists 2 configurations. What is the third one?\n$S=\\{1,2,3\\}$, $p=(1,1,1)$. Covers $[1,3]$.\n$S=\\{2\\}$, $p=(2)$.

Valid.\nThese are $3$ configurations for $n=4$.\nSo $a_4=3$.\nMy $F_{n+1}$ sequence: $F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5$.\nSo $a_1=1$, $a_2=2$, $a_3=2$, $a_4=3$.\nThis matches $F_{n+1}$ for $n=1,2$, but not $n=3,4$.\nThe sequence $a_n$ seems to be $F_{n+1}$ for $n=1,2$, but $F_4=3$ for $n=3$, $F_5=5$ for $n=4$.\nNo, $a_3=2$ implies $F_4=2$. $a_4=3$ implies $F_5=3$.\nThe sequence $a_n$ is $1, 2, 2, 3, 5$. This is $F_{n+1}$ starting from $n=1$ as $F_2$.\n$a_1=F_2=1$.\n$a_2=F_3=2$.\n$a_3=F_4=3$. No, example implies $a_3=2$.\n$a_4=F_5=5$. No, example implies $a_4=3$.\n$a_5=F_6=8$. No, example implies $a_5=5$.\n\nThe example outputs are $1/2, 1/4, 5/32$.\n$n=2$: $a_2=2$.\n$n=3$: $a_3=2$.\n$n=5$: $a_5=5$.\nThis sequence $a_n: (a_1=1), a_2=2, a_3=2, a_4=?, a_5=5$.\nThis sequence is $F_{n+1}$ for $n=1,2,5$.\nBut for $n=3$, $a_3=2$ while $F_4=3$. For $n=4$, $a_4$ is not given, but $F_5=5$.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully. \"towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal\".\nThis means $p_i \\le i$ and $p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nMy recurrence $g(j) = g(j-1) + g(j-3) + \\dots$ implicitly assumes that the centers $i$ of segments are valid.\nFor a segment of length $L=2k-1$ ending at $j$, its center is $i = j-k+1$.\nThe condition $k \\le i$ translates to $k \\le j-k+1 \\implies 2k-1 \\le j \\implies L \\le j$. This is automatically handled by the sum.\nThe condition $k \\le n+1-i$ translates to $k \\le n+1-(j-k+1) \\implies k \\le n+1-j+k-1 \\implies 0 \\le n-j$.\nThis means $j \\le n$. This is also handled by the fact that $g(j)$ is for tiling $[1,j]$ where $j \\le n$.\nSo the $F_{n+1}$ recurrence is correct.\n\nWhy is the example output different from my $F_{n+1}$ for $n=3$?\nMy calculation for $n=3$:\n1. $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$, $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$. Covers $[1,3]$. Valid.\n2. $S=\\{2\\}$, $p_2=2$. Covers $[1,3]$. Valid.\nThese are the only 2 ways for $n=3$. So $a_3=2$.\nMy recurrence $g(3)=2$ is correct. $F_4=3$ is incorrect.\n$F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$.\nThe recurrence $g(j)=g(j-1)+g(j-2)$ with $g(0)=1, g(1)=1$ gives $1,1,2,3,5,\\dots$.\nSo $g(n)$ is $F_{n+1}$.\nFor $n=1, g(1)=1$. $F_2=1$.\nFor $n=2, g(2)=1$. $F_3=2$.\nFor $n=3, g(3)=2$. $F_4=3$.\nFor $n=4, g(4)=3$. $F_5=5$.\nFor $n=5, g(5)=5$. $F_6=8$.\n\nThe example outputs $1/2$ for $n=2$ (so $a_2=2$).\nThe example outputs $1/4$ for $n=3$ (so $a_3=2$).\nThe example outputs $5/32$ for $n=5$ (so $a_5=5$).\nMy calculated $a_n$ values are:\n$a_1 = g(1) = 1$.\n$a_2 = g(2) = 1$. (This contradicts example $n=2$ output $1/2$ which means $a_2=2$)\n$a_3 = g(3) = 2$. (This matches example $n=3$ output $1/4$ which means $a_3=2$)\n$a_4 = g(4) = 3$.\n$a_5 = g(5) = 5$. (This matches example $n=5$ output $5/32$ which means $a_5=5$)\n\nSo my $g(n)$ is correct for $n=3,5$ but not for $n=2$.\nWhat is the difference for $n=2$?\n$n=2$:\n1. $S=\\{1,2\\}$, $p_1=1, p_2=1$. Valid.\nThis is the only way to tile $[1,2]$ with length 1 segments.\n2. $S=\\{2\\}$, $p_2=2$. Covers $[1,3]$. Invalid, covers town $3$.\nThis configuration is NOT valid because $p_2=2$ requires $2 \\le \\min(2, 2+1-2)=\\min(2,1)=1$. So $p_2$ cannot be $2$.\nSo, for $n=2$, only $S=\\{1,2\\}$ is valid. $a_2=1$.\nThis contradicts the example output $1/2$. The example output $1/2$ means $a_2=2$.\nThe problem statement: \"signal power on each tower to some integer from $1$ to $n$\".\nFor $n=2$, town $2$, power $p_2=2$. Is $2 \\in [1,2]$? Yes.\n\"signal from a tower located in a town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches every city $c$ such that $|c-i|<p$\".\nFor $n=2$, tower at $2$, power $p_2=2$. Covers $c$ s.t. $|c-2|<2$.\nThis means $c \\in (0,4)$. So $c \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.\nConstraints: \"towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal\".\nFor $n=2$, town $0$ and $3$ don't get signal.\nBut tower at $2$ with $p_2=2$ covers $3$. So this is NOT valid.\nSo my $a_2=1$ is correct. The example output for $n=2$ is wrong or I misunderstood something fundamental.\n\nLet's check the constraint $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ again.\nFor $n=2$, tower at $2$, power $p_2$.\n$p_2 \\le \\min(2, 2+1-2) = \\min(2,1) = 1$.\nSo $p_2$ must be $1$.\nIf $p_2=1$, it covers only town $2$.\nSo for $n=2$, only $S=\\{1,2\\}$ with $p_1=1, p_2=1$ is valid. $a_2=1$.\nProbability $1/2^2 = 1/4$.\nSo the note for $n=2$ is correct (\"The real answer for the first example is $1/4$\"), but the example output $748683265$ (which is $1/2$) is incorrect. I should trust the note.\n\nIf $a_2=1$, then my $F_{n+1}$ sequence does not match. $F_3=2$.\nThe problem is that the $g(j)=g(j-1)+g(j-2)$ recurrence for tiling assumes that all segments are valid.\nThe $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ constraint depends on the global $n$.\nFor $n=2$, a segment of length $3$ (tower $i$ with $p_i=2$) is invalid because $\\min(i, n+1-i)$ would be $1$.\nSo $g(j)$ is not simply $F_{j+1}$.\nThe recurrence $g(j) = g(j-1) + \\sum_{k=2}^{j/2+1} g(j-(2k-1))$ must be restricted by $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nFor a segment of length $L=2k-1$ centered at $i=j-k+1$:\nThe condition $k \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$ must hold.\n$k \\le j-k+1$ (this implies $L \\le j$, handled by sum range).\n$k \\le n+1-(j-k+1) \\implies k \\le n-j+k \\implies j \\le n$. This is always true for $j \\le n$.\nThis means that any valid tiling of $[1,j]$ for $j \\le n$ will satisfy the bounds.\nSo the recurrence $g(j)=F_{j+1}$ is indeed correct.\n\nLet's re-examine $n=2$.\n$a_2 = F_3 = 2$.\nThe two configurations for $n=2$ are:\n1. $S=\\{1,2\\}$, $p_1=1, p_2=1$. Valid.\n2. $S=\\{1\\}$. $p_1=2$. Covers $[0,2]$. Invalid, covers $0$. (This is $p_1=2$, but $p_1 \\le \\min(1, 2+1-1)=\\min(1,2)=1$. So $p_1=2$ is invalid.)\nNo, $S=\\{1\\}$ is not valid because $p_1=1$ covers only $1$. Town $2$ is not covered.\nSo $a_2=1$.\nMy $F_{n+1}$ sequence is $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$ for $n=1,2,3,4,5,\\dots$.\n$a_1=1$. $a_2=1$. $a_3=2$. $a_4=3$. $a_5=5$.\nThis sequence $1,1,2,3,5$ is $F_2, F_3, F_4, F_5, F_6$. So $a_n = F_{n+1}$.\nSo the general formula $a_n=F_{n+1}$ is correct.\nThe example output for $n=2$ is $1/2$. This means $a_2=2$.\nMy $a_2=1$.\nThe note for $n=2$ says $1/4$. This means $a_2=1$.\nThis means the example output $748683265$ for $n=2$ is wrong, it should be $249561089$.\nAnd the example output for $n=3$ is $842268673$. This means $a_3=2$.\nMy $a_3=2$.\nThe note for $n=3$ says $1/4$. This means $a_3=2$.\nThis matches.\nThe example output for $n=5$ is $842268673$. This means $a_5=5$.\nMy $a_5=5$.\nThe note for $n=5$ says $5/32$. This means $a_5=5$.\nThis matches.\n\nSo the Fibonacci formula $a_n = F_{n+1}$ works for $n=3,5$ and $n=1$.\nIt gives $a_2=1$. The example output for $n=2$ seems to be $1/2$ (meaning $a_2=2$), but the note says $1/4$ (meaning $a_2=1$).\nI will trust my derivation $a_n=F_{n+1}$ and the note for $n=2,3,5$.\nThe code will compute $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nFinal check on $n=2$:\n$S=\\{1,2\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$.\n$p_1=1 \\le \\min(1, 2+1-1)=\\min(1,2)=1$. Valid.\n$p_2=1 \\le \\min(2, 2+1-2)=\\min(2,1)=1$. Valid.\nCovers $[1,1]$ and $[2,2]$. Disjoint. Union is $[1,2]$. Valid.\nThis is one configuration. $a_2=1$.\nProbability $1/4$.\n\nFinal check on $n=3$:\n$a_3=2$.\n1. $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$, $p_1=1,p_2=1,p_3=1$. Valid.\n2. $S=\\{2\\}$, $p_2=2$. $p_2=2 \\le \\min(2, 3+1-2)=\\min(2,2)=2$. Valid. Covers $[1,3]$. Valid.\nThese are the two configurations. $a_3=2$.\nProbability $2/8=1/4$.\n\nFinal check on $n=5$:\n$a_5=5$.\n$F_6=8$. My formula is $F_{n+1}$.\n$F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$.\nSo my formula gives $a_5=8$. But the example says $a_5=5$.\n\nThere is a subtle constraint I am missing or misinterpreting.\nThe problem: \"signal power on each tower to some integer from $1$ to $n$\".\nThis is not $p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$. This is $1 \\le p_i \\le n$.\nThe constraints $p_i \\le i$ and $p_i \\le n+1-i$ come from the \"towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal\" condition.\nSo the effective range for $p_i$ is $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(n, i, n+1-i)$.\nSince $i, n+1-i \\le n$ for $i \\in [1,n]$, this is equivalent to $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\nSo my interpretation of $p_i$ bounds is correct.\n\nLet's verify the $n=5$ example from the note:\n\"if $n=5$, and you have built the towers in towns $2$, $4$ and $5$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $2$ to $2$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $4$ and $5$ to $1$.\"\n$S=\\{2,4,5\\}$.\n$p_2=2$. $p_2 \\le \\min(2, 5+1-2) = \\min(2,4)=2$. Valid. Covers $[1,3]$.\n$p_4=1$. $p_4 \\le \\min(4, 5+1-4) = \\min(4,2)=2$. Valid. Covers $[4,4]$.\n$p_5=1$. $p_5 \\le \\min(5, 5+1-5) = \\min(5,1)=1$. Valid. Covers $[5,5]$.\nUnion of coverage: $[1,3] \\cup [4,4] \\cup [5,5] = [1,5]$. This is a valid configuration.\nThis one configuration is counted by my $g(5)=5$ formula.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence $F_k$ in the problem context is $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\nThe sequence of values $a_n$ that matches the problem's example outputs (after correcting $n=2$ output to match note):\n$n=1$: $a_1=1$. (Not in example, but $F_2=1$)\n$n=2$: $a_2=1$. (Matches note $1/4$, but not output $1/2$) ($F_3=2$)\n$n=3$: $a_3=2$. (Matches note $1/4$) ($F_4=3$)\n$n=4$: $a_4=3$. (Not in example) ($F_5=5$)\n$n=5$: $a_5=5$. (Matches note $5/32$) ($F_6=8$)\n\nIt seems the sequence $a_n$ is $F_n$ (using $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$).\n$a_1=F_1=1$.\n$a_2=F_2=1$.\n$a_3=F_3=2$.\n$a_4=F_4=3$.\n$a_5=F_5=5$.\nThis sequence $F_n$ ($1,1,2,3,5$) perfectly matches the (corrected) example values $a_n$.\nSo the number of valid configurations is $F_n$.\nThe probability is $F_n / 2^n$.\n\nLet's confirm the recurrence for $F_n$.\n$f(j)$ = number of ways to tile $[1,j]$ with segments of length 1 or segments of odd length $L \\ge 3$.\n$f(0)=1$\n$f(1)=f(0)=1$ (segment length 1 at 1)\n$f(2)=f(1)=1$ (segment length 1 at 2)\n$f(3)=f(2)+f(0)=1+1=2$ (segment length 1 at 3, or segment length 3 at 2)\n$f(4)=f(3)+f(1)=2+1=3$ (segment length 1 at 4, or segment length 3 at 3)\n$f(5)=f(4)+f(2)+f(0)=3+1+1=5$ (segment length 1 at 5, or segment length 3 at 4, or segment length 5 at 3)\nThis is $F_n$ where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$.\nSo $f(n)=F_n$.\nThis is the correct recurrence and sequence.\n\nThe matrix for $F_n$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} F_k \\\\ F_{k-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe need $F_n$. So we want $F_n$ and $F_{n-1}$.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_n \\\\ F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1} \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^{n-1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nIf $n=1$, $(1,0)$ is $(F_1, F_0)$. So $F_1=1$.\nIf $n=0$, $F_0=0$.\nSo for $n=1$, $F_1=1$.\nFor $n=2$, $F_2=1$.\nFor $n=3$, $F_3=2$.\nThis matches the corrected $a_n$ values.\n\nThe maximum $n$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$.
