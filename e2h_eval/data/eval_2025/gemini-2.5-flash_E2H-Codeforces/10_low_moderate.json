Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Golorp's Diet: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm diving into this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem, and my initial thoughts are swirling around how to translate this into Python code. The core challenge here is definitely finding the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable assignments that satisfies the Golorp's dietary \"program,\" or figuring out that it's impossible.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the \"Golorp's Name\" actually *means*. The examples point to a specific syntax: `?(<expression>):-<conditions>`. This makes me think I'll need a parser, likely using something like regular expressions, to break down the input string into its components.\n\nThe real head-scratcher is deciphering how those underscores (`_`, `__`, `___`, etc.) relate to variables and numbers. I initially assumed they represented different variables, but that doesn't align with the single-digit constraints mentioned in the problem. The examples actually make this clearer. My current working assumption is that `_` represents a variable, *and* that each underscore represents a single-digit variable value that has to be assigned. The quantity of underscores in a sequence doesn't matter, only the order. The underscores in the condition portion can then be interpreted as representing individual digits. It seems like the number of variables is not explicitly defined, but rather has to be derived from the expression (and perhaps the conditions too).\n\nSo, the plan: First, parse the Golorp's \"name.\" Second, assign the smallest possible values (0 to 9) to those variables, and evaluate the expression and the conditions to see if it's feasible. The lexicographic constraint means I should probably try to be greedy with each variable from left to right, starting with the smallest possible value. If that fails, increment the value. Repeat the process until a solution is found or it's exhausted.\n\nThis feels like a problem where a backtracking algorithm would come in handy, since I'll be trying combinations and abandoning branches that lead to unsatisfiable conditions. Also, I'll need to figure out a smart way to represent and evaluate these expressions; perhaps a custom expression parser or leveraging Python's built-in `eval` function (though I'll need to be *very* careful with that). Time to get coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of single-digit variable values (0-9) that satisfies a golorp's \"diet\" defined by its name. The name consists of an arithmetic expression and a list of conditions.\n\nLet's break down the structure of the golorp's name: `?(<expression>):-<conditions>.`\n\n1.  **Variables:** Each `_` in the `<expression>` part represents a distinct variable. We need to assign a value from 0-9 to each of these variables. The values are listed in the order they appear in the expression.\n    For example, in `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`, the expression is `_-_/___*__`. This contains 7 underscores, so there are 7 variables. Let's call them `v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6`. The output will be a 7-digit string.\n\n2.  **Parsing Numbers:** In both the expression and conditions, sequences of underscores (`_`, `__`, `___`, etc.) represent numbers. The number of underscores indicates the number of digits in that number. For example, `_` is a single-digit number (a variable), `__` is a two-digit number, `___` is a three-digit number.\n    *   If `_` corresponds to `v0`, `__` corresponds to `v1v2`, `___` corresponds to `v3v4v5`.\n    *   The values assigned to `v0, v1, v2, ...` are used to form these multi-digit numbers.\n    *   A multi-digit number like `v1v2` is interpreted as `v1 * 10 + v2`.\n    *   Important constraint: Multi-digit numbers cannot have leading zeros unless they are just '0'. E.g., `__` cannot be `05`, it must be `5`. This means if `v1v2` is `__`, then `v1` cannot be 0 unless `v2` is also 0 (meaning the number is 0). If `_` is a standalone number, it can be 0.\n\n3.  **Operators:** The expression supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. Standard integer arithmetic applies. Division `/` is integer division.\n\n4.  **Conditions:** A comma-separated list of comparisons: `A>B`, `A<B`, `A=B`. All conditions must be true.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Extract Variable Count and Number Tokens:**\n    *   First, parse the entire string to identify all sequences of `_` characters. These represent numbers.\n    *   We need to distinguish variables that are part of the *expression* from variables that are part of *numbers* in the conditions.\n    *   Let's simplify: every `_` in the entire string will consume a variable from our input sequence. We need to assign values to these variables. The *order* of `_`s in the original string determines the order of variable values in the output.\n    *   Example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n        *   Expression part: `_-_/___*__` (7 underscores)\n        *   Conditions part: `___>__` (5 underscores)\n        *   Total underscores: 12. This means we need 12 variables in total. Output will be 12 digits.\n        *   This interpretation is consistent with the example `0010` for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` if the output `0010` means `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1, v3=0`, and the original 7 underscores in the expression are actually 4 variables: `v0, v1, v2, v3`. This implies that `___` and `__` are not composed of multiple variables, but are *single variables* whose values are implicitly treated as multi-digit numbers. This is where the problem statement is ambiguous.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate based on the examples and \"lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values\". The output `0010` for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.` has 4 digits. The expression `_-_/___*__` contains `_`, `_`, `___`, `__`. If each of these groups represents a single value, then there are 4 values. This seems to be the most consistent interpretation:\n    *   Each contiguous block of `_`s represents a single number.\n    *   These numbers are the \"variables\" that we need to assign values to.\n    *   The *length* of the block (`_`, `__`, `___`) indicates the number of digits in that variable.\n    *   The total count of such blocks in the expression part determines the length of the output string.\n\n    Revised variable extraction:\n    1.  Find the `?(` and `):-`. The part between them is the expression.\n    2.  Find the `:-` and `.`. The part between them is the conditions.\n    3.  In the expression, identify all `_` blocks. Each block is a variable. Store their lengths. Let's say we have `N` such variables.\n    4.  The output will be `N` digits, representing the values assigned to these `N` variables.\n\n    Example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    *   Expression: `_-_/___*__`\n        *   `_` (length 1) -> `v0`\n        *   `_` (length 1) -> `v1`\n        *   `___` (length 3) -> `v2`\n        *   `__` (length 2) -> `v3`\n        *   Total variables in expression: 4. Output will be 4 digits.\n    *   Conditions: `___>__`\n        *   `___` (length 3) -> `c0`\n        *   `__` (length 2) -> `c1`\n\n2.  **Backtracking/DFS for Lexicographically Smallest:**\n    *   We need to assign values (0-9) to `N` variables (`v0, v1, ..., vN-1`).\n    *   To get the lexicographically smallest sequence, we iterate `v0` from 0 to 9, then `v1` from 0 to 9, and so on.\n    *   This is a classic backtracking search.\n\n    `solve(k, current_values)`:\n    *   `k`: The index of the variable we are currently assigning a value to (`v_k`).\n    *   `current_values`: A list of values assigned to `v0` through `v_k-1`.\n\n    *   **Base Case:** If `k == N` (all variables assigned):\n        *   Evaluate the expression using `current_values`.\n        *   Evaluate all conditions using `current_values`.\n        *   If both are valid and all conditions are true, we found a solution. Since we are searching lexicographically, this is the smallest, so return `True` and the `current_values`.\n\n    *   **Recursive Step:** For `digit` from 0 to 9:\n        *   Add `digit` to `current_values` for `v_k`.\n        *   **Leading Zero Check:** If `digit == 0` and the `k`-th variable (from the expression) is a multi-digit number (its length > 1), then this is an invalid assignment (e.g., `__` cannot be `0`). Skip this `digit`.\n        *   Call `solve(k + 1, current_values)`. If it returns `True`, propagate `True` up.\n        *   Remove `digit` from `current_values` (backtrack).\n\n    *   If no `digit` leads to a solution, return `False`.\n\n3.  **Evaluation Function:**\n    *   `evaluate(token_list, assigned_values, var_lengths)`:\n        *   `token_list`: A list of parsed tokens (numbers, operators, condition operators).\n        *   `assigned_values`: The `N` values from `v0` to `vN-1`.\n        *   `var_lengths`: A list of lengths for each of the `N` variables in the expression.\n        *   This function needs to map the `assigned_values` back to the actual numbers in the expression and conditions.\n        *   For example, if `var_lengths` for expression are `[1, 1, 3, 2]` and `assigned_values` are `[0, 0, 1, 0]`:\n            *   `v0` (length 1) gets `0`.\n            *   `v1` (length 1) gets `0`.\n            *   `v2` (length 3) gets `1`.\n            *   `v3` (length 2) gets `0`.\n            *   These `v_i` are the actual single-digit values.\n            *   When we encounter `___` in the conditions, it's a new number. We need to assign `assigned_values` to its digits.\n            *   This is where the ambiguity is highest. If `0010` is the answer for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`, then `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1, v3=0`.\n                *   Expression: `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`.\n                *   Conditions: `c0 > c1`.\n                *   What are `v2, v3, c0, c1`? Are `v2, v3` multi-digit numbers formed by `0010`?\n                *   If `v0`=`_`, `v1`=`_`, `v2`=`___`, `v3`=`__` are the variables, then `assigned_values` is `[0,0,1,0]`.\n                *   `v0=0`, `v1=0`, `v2=1`, `v3=0`.\n                *   The values of these variables are directly `0,0,1,0`.\n                *   The length of `___` being 3 and `__` being 2 in the expression are just \"metadata\" about the variable, not that it's a multi-digit number.\n                *   However, in conditions like `___>__`, `___` and `__` *must* be multi-digit numbers.\n                *   This means we need to keep track of *all* `_` blocks in the entire string, assign variables to them sequentially (`v0, v1, ... v_TOTAL-1`), and then use these `v_i` to form numbers.\n\n    Let's refine variable assignment:\n    1.  Parse the entire golorp name. Replace each `_` with a unique variable name, say `x0, x1, x2, ...`.\n    2.  The total number of `_`s in the *entire* string is `TOTAL_VARS`.\n    3.  The output sequence will be `TOTAL_VARS` digits.\n    4.  We will use backtracking to assign values `d_0, d_1, ..., d_TOTAL_VARS-1` to `x_0, x_1, ..., x_TOTAL_VARS-1`.\n\n    Example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    *   `?(` `x0` `-` `x1` `/` `x2x3x4` `*` `x5x6` `):-` `x7x8x9` `>` `x10x11` `.`\n    *   `TOTAL_VARS = 12`.\n    *   `assigned_values = [d0, d1, ..., d11]`.\n    *   The `evaluate` function will substitute these `d_i` values.\n    *   For `x0`, its value is `d0`.\n    *   For `x2x3x4`, its value is `d2*100 + d3*10 + d4`.\n    *   **Leading Zero Check:**\n        *   If `d_i` is the first digit of a multi-digit number (e.g., `d2` for `x2x3x4`), then `d_i` cannot be `0` unless the number itself is `0` (i.e., all subsequent digits are also `0`). This is tricky to check during backtracking.\n        *   Easier: Check leading zeros *after* forming the number. If `d_i` is the first digit of a multi-digit number and `d_i == 0` and the number is not `0`, then it's invalid.\n\n    Let's re-examine `0010` for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`. This output has 4 digits. My current interpretation (`TOTAL_VARS = 12`) yields 12 digits. This implies my interpretation of `_` blocks is wrong.\n\n    The problem states: \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive.\" \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\"\n    \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\n\n    The most consistent interpretation with the example outputs:\n    *   Each `_` block in the *expression part* of the golorp's name defines a *single variable* `v_i`.\n    *   The *value* of `v_i` is a single digit (0-9).\n    *   The *length* of the `_` block (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`) indicates the *number of digits* for *that variable's representation in the context of numbers being formed*. This is confusing.\n\n    Let's try a different approach based on what `0010` suggests for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`:\n    *   `_` (1st) -> `v0=0`\n    *   `_` (2nd) -> `v1=0`\n    *   `___` (3rd) -> `v2=1`\n    *   `__` (4th) -> `v3=0`\n    *   The output is `v0v1v2v3`. This means there are 4 distinct variables in the expression. The length of the `_` block (`_`, `___`, `__`) is just a *label* for the variable, not its number of digits. The variables themselves are single digits.\n\n    Now, how are numbers formed in the expression and conditions?\n    *   Expression: `v0 - v1 / v2 * v3`.\n        *   `v0` is the value assigned to the first `_` (0).\n        *   `v1` is the value assigned to the second `_` (0).\n        *   `v2` is the value assigned to the `___` (1).\n        *   `v3` is the value assigned to the `__` (0).\n        *   So, `0 - 0 / 1 * 0 = 0`. The expression evaluates to `0`.\n    *   Conditions: `___>__`\n        *   This `___` refers to `v2` (value 1).\n        *   This `__` refers to `v3` (value 0).\n        *   So the condition is `1 > 0`, which is true.\n    *   This interpretation works for the first example!\n\n    **Revised Variable and Number Parsing Strategy:**\n\n    1.  **Identify Variables in Expression:**\n        *   Scan the string between `?(` and `):-`.\n        *   Every contiguous block of `_` characters represents a unique variable.\n        *   Assign an index `0, 1, ..., N-1` to these variables in order of appearance. `N` is the total number of such blocks in the expression.\n        *   The output will be `N` digits.\n        *   Store the *string representation* (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`) for each of these `N` variables. This is needed for mapping in the conditions.\n\n    2.  **Parse Expression and Conditions into Tokens:**\n        *   Replace each `_` block in the expression with its variable name (e.g., `v0`, `v1`).\n        *   Replace each `_` block in the conditions with its corresponding variable name.\n            *   If a `_` block in the conditions matches one of the `N` variables from the expression (e.g., `___` in `___>__` matches the `___` in the expression which is `v2`), then use that variable `v2`.\n            *   If a `_` block in the conditions does *not* match any variable from the expression (this shouldn't happen based on examples, but if it did, it would be a new variable, which contradicts the output length). The problem states \"All names are similar\".\n\n    Let's assume the `_` blocks are identified globally, and then mapped.\n    Example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    *   All `_` blocks:\n        1.  `_` (expr) -> `v0`\n        2.  `_` (expr) -> `v1`\n        3.  `___` (expr) -> `v2`\n        4.  `__` (expr) -> `v3`\n        5.  `___` (cond) -> This `___` *is* `v2` because it's the same block.\n        6.  `__` (cond) -> This `__` *is* `v3` because it's the same block.\n    *   So, we have 4 variables `v0, v1, v2, v3`.\n    *   Output `0010` means `v0=0, v1=0, v2=1, v3=0`.\n\n    This looks like the correct interpretation. The *number of variables* is the number of distinct `_` blocks in the expression. The *value* of each variable is a single digit. The *form* of the `_` block (e.g., `___`) is just its identifier.\n\n    **Implementation Details:**\n\n    1.  **Parsing:**\n        *   Use regular expressions to find all `_` blocks (e.g., `_+`).\n        *   Store these unique `_` block strings (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`) and map them to variable indices `0, 1, ..., N-1`.\n        *   Replace these blocks in the expression and conditions with placeholders (e.g., `VAR0`, `VAR1`).\n        *   Then parse the expression and conditions into RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) for easier evaluation.\n\n    2.  **Evaluation (RPN):**\n        *   When evaluating an RPN token:\n            *   If it's an operator, pop two operands, apply, push result.\n            *   If it's a number, push it.\n            *   If it's a `VARk` placeholder, retrieve `assigned_values[k]`.\n        *   For leading zero check: If `assigned_values[k] == 0` and the `_` block corresponding to `VARk` has length > 1 (e.g., `__`, `___`), then this is invalid. This check should be done *during assignment* for the `VARk` that represents the *first digit* of a multi-digit constant.\n            *   Wait, the problem states \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive.\" This implies `v_i` is always a single digit.\n            *   The leading zero constraint applies to *numbers formed by multiple digits*.\n            *   Example: `?(___):-___>__`\n                *   Expression: `___` -> `v0`\n                *   Condition: `___>__` -> `v0 > v1`\n                *   Output: `010` (3 variables)\n                *   `v0=0, v1=1, v2=0`.\n                *   This example shows that `___` in expression is `v0`. `___` in condition is `v0`. `__` in condition is `v1`.\n                *   This means the `_` blocks from the expression are the variables `v_i`.\n                *   The `_` blocks in the conditions are *references* to these variables.\n                *   `?(__+___):-__>___`\n                    *   `__` (expr) -> `v0`\n                    *   `___` (expr) -> `v1`\n                    *   `__` (cond) -> `v0`\n                    *   `___` (cond) -> `v1`\n                    *   Variables: `v0, v1`. Output: 2 digits.\n                    *   Expression: `v0 + v1`.\n                    *   Condition: `v0 > v1`.\n\n    This interpretation seems the most robust and consistent with all examples.\n\n    **Final Refined Strategy:**\n\n    1.  **Parse Input String:**\n        *   Extract expression string (between `?(` and `):-`).\n        *   Extract conditions string (between `:-` and `.`).\n        *   Use `re.finditer(r'_+', expression_string)` to find all `_` blocks in the expression.\n        *   For each unique `_` block string (e.g., `_`, `__`, `___`), assign it a unique variable name (e.g., `v0`, `v1`, `v2`). Store this mapping (e.g., `{\"_\": \"v0\", \"___\": \"v1\", ...}`). Let `N` be the total number of unique variable names.\n        *   The output will be `N` digits.\n\n    2.  **Transform Expression and Conditions:**\n        *   Iterate through the `_` blocks in the expression string. Replace each block with its assigned variable name (e.g., `_` becomes `v0`).\n        *   Do the same for the conditions string.\n        *   Example: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n            *   Expression: `_-_/___*__`\n            *   Unique blocks: `_`, `___`, `__`.\n            *   Mapping: `_` -> `v0`, `___` -> `v1`, `__` -> `v2`. (Note: order of assignment matters for lexicographical output, so `v0` is the *first* `_` block, `v1` is the *second* `_` block, etc. This means `_` (first) is `v0`, `_` (second) is `v1`, `___` is `v2`, `__` is `v3`.)\n            *   Revised mapping for `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`:\n                *   `_` (at index 2) -> `v0`\n                *   `_` (at index 4) -> `v1`\n                *   `___` (at index 7) -> `v2`\n                *   `__` (at index 11) -> `v3`\n            *   The number of variables `N` is 4.\n            *   Transformed Expression: `v0-v1/v2*v3`\n            *   Transformed Conditions: `v2>v3` (using the same `v2` and `v3` from the expression part).\n\n    3.  **Backtracking (`dfs`) Function:**\n        *   `dfs(k, current_assignment)`:\n            *   `k`: Current variable index (0 to `N-1`).\n            *   `current_assignment`: List of `N` digits assigned so far.\n            *   Base Case: If `k == N`:\n                *   Evaluate the transformed expression using `current_assignment`. If it fails (e.g., division by zero), return `False`.\n                *   Evaluate all transformed conditions. If any is false, return `False`.\n                *   If all pass, return `True` (solution found).\n            *   Recursive Step: For `digit` from 0 to 9:\n                *   Add `digit` to `current_assignment`.\n                *   Call `dfs(k + 1, current_assignment)`. If `True`, return `True`.\n                *   Pop `digit` (backtrack).\n            *   Return `False`.\n\n    4.  **Evaluation of Transformed Expression/Conditions:**\n        *   Convert the transformed expression/conditions into RPN.\n        *   Evaluate RPN:\n            *   Numbers: push to stack.\n            *   Variables (`vk`): push `current_assignment[k]` to stack.\n            *   Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `>`, `<`, `=`): pop operands, perform operation, push result.\n            *   Division by zero: If `b == 0` for `a / b`, return an error/invalid state.\n            *   Comparisons: return boolean (true/false).\n\n    **Example `?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.` -> `false`**\n    *   Expression: `__-_+_/_____`\n    *   Conditions: `__>__,_____<__`\n    *   Variables (blocks in expression):\n        *   `__` (1st) -> `v0`\n        *   `_` (2nd) -> `v1`\n        *   `_` (3rd) -> `v2`\n        *   `_____` (4th) -> `v3`\n    *   `N = 4`. Output will be 4 digits.\n    *   Transformed Expression: `v0 - v1 + v2 / v3`\n    *   Transformed Conditions: `v0 > v0`, `v3 < v0`\n    *   The condition `v0 > v0` is always false. Thus, it's impossible to feed this golorp. Output `false`. This matches the example.\n\n    **Example `?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.` -> `0101`**\n    *   Expression: `__+___+__-___`\n    *   Conditions: `___>__`\n    *   Variables (blocks in expression):\n        *   `__` (1st) -> `v0`\n        *   `___` (2nd) -> `v1`\n        *   `__` (3rd) -> `v2`\n        *   `___` (4th) -> `v3`\n    *   `N = 4`. Output will be 4 digits.\n    *   Transformed Expression: `v0 + v1 + v2 - v3`\n    *   Transformed Conditions: `v1 > v2`\n    *   Output `0101` means `v0=0, v1=1, v2=0, v3=1`.\n    *   Expression evaluation: `0 + 1 + 0 - 1 = 0`.\n    *   Condition evaluation: `1 > 0` is true.\n    *   This works.\n\n    **Parsing into RPN:**\n    A standard Shunting-yard algorithm can convert infix to RPN.\n    Operators precedence: `*`, `/` > `+`, `-` > `>`, `<`, `=` (comparisons have lowest precedence).\n    For conditions, each comparison `A op B` is a separate boolean expression.\n\n    **Leading Zero Constraint:** The problem statement implies single-digit variables. The \"leading zero\" constraint applies to numbers like `05` for a two-digit number. But here, `__` is a variable `v0`, and `v0` is a single digit. So `v0` can be `0`. The \"length\" of `__` is just its identifier. My previous concern about leading zeros for `v_i` is likely incorrect. The problem says \"Values from 0 to 9\". `v_i` are always single digits.\n\n    The only \"leading zero\" constraint that could apply is if `_` blocks were interpreted as multi-digit numbers formed by *multiple* variables. But the examples strongly suggest each `_` block in the expression is *one* single-digit variable.\n\n    So, the leading zero check can be removed. All `v_i` can be 0.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Operator precedence for Shunting-yard algorithm\n# Higher value means higher precedence\nOP_PRECEDENCE = {\n    '=': 1, '<': 1, '>': 1,\n    '+': 2, '-': 2,\n    '*': 3, '/': 3,\n}\n\n# Function to convert infix expression to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)\ndef infix_to_rpn(infix_tokens):\n    output = []\n    op_stack = []\n\n    for token in infix_tokens:\n        if token.startswith('v') and token[1:].isdigit():  # Variable\n            output.append(token)\n        elif token.isdigit():  # Number (not expected with current parsing, but for completeness)\n            output.append(token)\n        elif token == '(':\n            op_stack.append(token)\n        elif token == ')':\n            while op_stack and op_stack[-1] != '(':\n                output.append(op_stack.pop())\n            if op_stack and op_stack[-1] == '(':\n                op_stack.pop() # Pop '('\n            else:\n                raise ValueError(\"Mismatched parentheses\")\n        elif token in OP_PRECEDENCE:  # Operator\n            while (op_stack and op_stack[-1] != '(' and\n                   OP_PRECEDENCE.get(op_stack[-1], 0) >= OP_PRECEDENCE[token]):\n                output.append(op_stack.pop())\n            op_stack.append(token)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Unknown token: {token}\")\n\n    while op_stack:\n        if op_stack[-1] == '(':\n            raise ValueError(\"Mismatched parentheses\")\n        output.append(op_stack.pop())\n    return output\n\n# Function to evaluate an RPN expression\ndef evaluate_rpn(rpn_tokens, variable_values):\n    stack = []\n    for token in rpn_tokens:\n        if token.startswith('v') and token[1:].isdigit():\n            var_idx = int(token[1:])\n            stack.append(variable_values[var_idx])\n        elif token.isdigit() or (token.startswith('-') and token[1:].isdigit()): # Handle negative numbers if they appear, though not expected\n            stack.append(int(token))\n        elif token in OP_PRECEDENCE:\n            if len(stack) < 2:\n                raise ValueError(f\"Insufficient operands for operator {token}\")\n            b = stack.pop()\n            a = stack.pop()\n\n            if token == '+':\n                stack.append(a + b)\n            elif token == '-':\n                stack.append(a - b)\n            elif token == '*':\n                stack.append(a * b)\n            elif token == '/':\n                if b == 0:\n                    return None # Division by zero, invalid\n                stack.append(a // b) # Integer division\n            elif token == '>':\n                stack.append(1 if a > b else 0) # 1 for true, 0 for false\n            elif token == '<':\n                stack.append(1 if a < b else 0)\n            elif token == '=':\n                stack.append(1 if a == b else 0)\n    \n    if len(stack) != 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid RPN expression\")\n    return stack[0]\n\n# Main solver function\ndef solve():\n    golorp_name = input()\n\n    # 1.
