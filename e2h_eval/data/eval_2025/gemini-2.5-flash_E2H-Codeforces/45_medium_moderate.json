There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Knockout Tennis Tournament: Maximizing the Winner's Games**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this tennis tournament problem. The goal is to figure out the most games the winner can play, but there's a catch: players can only compete if their game counts are within one of each other. This feels like a puzzle about efficiently using players and game slots.\n\nI'm thinking about how the game counts evolve.  Initially, everyone has zero games. When two players meet, the winner's game count goes up by one, and the loser's out.  I want to maximize the winner's games, which intuitively means getting the winner to play as many matches as possible while sticking to the game-count rule.\n\nMy key insight is to track the number of players who've won a certain number of games (let's call it `k`).  I'm labeling the number of players with `k` wins as `N_k`. Initially, `N_0` is the total number of players (`n`), and all other `N_k` values are zero. When a match happens, the numbers shift. If a player with `g_A` games plays against one with `g_B` games (where `|g_A - g_B| <= 1`), then the winner (say A) moves from `N_{g_A}` to `N_{g_A + 1}`, and both `N_{g_A}` and `N_{g_B}` decrease by one.\n\nTo maximize the winner's games, I want the winner to play against opponents who are at a similar game count or slightly lower. This allows me to build the winner's game count quickly and ensures I use the available players efficiently. I'm trying to figure out the *minimum* number of players required to produce a winner with a certain number of games.\n\nThis becomes a recurrence relation, and I'm letting `dp[k]` be the minimum number of players needed to get a winner who has played `k` games. To win `k` games, the player had to have won `k-1` before.  That means the opponent must have had either `k-1` or `k-2` games. To minimize players, I'd want the opponent to have played as many games as possible, so let's say `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`. The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` (a starter) and `dp[1] = 2`. This looks remarkably like the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8...` is, in fact, `F_{k+2}`.\n\nNow, my problem boils down to finding the largest `k` such that the Fibonacci number `F_{k+2}` is less than or equal to the total number of players, `n`. That's it! To solve this I am calculating fibonacci numbers, comparing them against the input `n` and stopping once the Fibonacci numbers surpass `n`. From here I am able to work out the number of matches the winner will be able to play.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. We are given the total number of players `n`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\n\n1.  **Base Cases:**\n    *   `dp[0] = 1`: A single player who hasn't played any games yet.\n    *   `dp[1] = 2`: To win 1 game, a player (with 0 wins) must play against another player (with 0 wins). This requires 2 players. The winner ends up with 1 game played.\n\n2.  **Recurrence Relation for `k >= 2`:**\n    Suppose a player `W` has `k-1` wins and is about to play their `k`-th game. Their opponent `O` must satisfy the rule: `|(k-1) - games_O| <= 1`. This means `games_O` can be `k-2` or `k-1`.\n    To minimize the total number of players needed to produce `W` with `k` wins, we should choose the opponent `O` that requires fewer players to produce.\n\n    *   **Option 1: Opponent `O` has `k-1` wins.**\n        To produce `W` with `k-1` wins, we need `dp[k-1]` players.\n        To produce `O` with `k-1` wins, we need `dp[k-1]` players.\n        Total players required: `dp[k-1] + dp[k-1] = 2 * dp[k-1]`.\n\n    *   **Option 2: Opponent `O` has `k-2` wins.**\n        To produce `W` with `k-1` wins, we need `dp[k-1]` players.\n        To produce `O` with `k-2` wins, we need `dp[k-2]` players.\n        Total players required: `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`.\n\n    Since `dp[k-1] > dp[k-2]` for `k-1 >= 2` (as `dp` values are increasing), it follows that `dp[k-1] + dp[k-2] < 2 * dp[k-1]`.\n    Therefore, the most efficient way (i.e., using the minimum number of players) to produce a winner with `k` games is to have them play against an opponent with `k-2` wins.\n    This gives the recurrence relation: `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]` for `k >= 2`.\n\n3.  **Fibonacci Sequence:**\n    Let's list the `dp` values:\n    `dp[0] = 1`\n    `dp[1] = 2`\n    `dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`\n    `dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3 + 2 = 5`\n    `dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] = 5 + 3 = 8`\n    This sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...` corresponds to the standard Fibonacci sequence `F_m` where `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, ...`. Specifically, `dp[k] = F_{k+2}`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Maximum `k`:**\n    We need to find the largest `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`. This is equivalent to finding the largest `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n    Since `n` can be as large as `10^18`, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`. The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so this will involve a small number of iterations (around 90 for `10^18`).\n\n5.  **Algorithm:**\n    Initialize `a = 1` (representing `dp[0]`), `b = 2` (representing `dp[1]`), and `games_count = 1` (representing the number of games for the winner associated with `b`).\n    Iteratively update `a` and `b` to generate subsequent Fibonacci numbers:\n    While `b <= n`:\n        `next_fib = a + b`\n        `a = b`\n        `b = next_fib`\n        `games_count += 1`\n    When the loop terminates, `b` is the first Fibonacci number (`dp[games_count]`) that is greater than `n`. The previous value `a` was `dp[games_count-1]`, which was less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the maximum number of games the winner can play is `games_count - 1`.\n\nExample Trace for `n=10`:\n*   Initial: `a=1`, `b=2`, `games_count=1`.\n*   Iteration 1: `b=2 <= 10`. `next_fib=1+2=3`. `a=2`, `b=3`. `games_count=2`.\n*   Iteration 2: `b=3 <= 10`. `next_fib=2+3=5`. `a=3`, `b=5`. `games_count=3`.\n*   Iteration 3: `b=5 <= 10`. `next_fib=3+5=8`. `a=5`, `b=8`. `games_count=4`.\n*   Iteration 4: `b=8 <= 10`. `next_fib=5+8=13`. `a=8`, `b=13`. `games_count=5`.\n*   Iteration 5: `b=13 > 10`. Loop terminates.\n*   Result: `games_count - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n\nThis matches the example outputs.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # 'a' represents dp[k-2], the minimum players for a winner to have k-2 games.\n    # 'b' represents dp[k-1], the minimum players for a winner to have k-1 games.\n    # 'games_count' represents k-1, the number of games played by the winner corresponding to 'b'.\n    \n    # Initial values:\n    # dp[0] = 1 (A player who hasn't played yet)\n    # dp[1] = 2 (A player wins against another player, both started with 0 games)\n    # So, initially:\n    # a = dp[0] = 1\n    # b = dp[1] = 2\n    # games_count = 1 (corresponding to b=dp[1])\n    \n    a = 1\n    b = 2\n    games_count = 1 \n\n    # We iterate to find the largest 'games_count' such that dp[games_count] <= n.\n    # The loop continues as long as 'b' (which is dp[games_count]) is less than or equal to 'n'.\n    while b <= n:\n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number (which would be dp[games_count + 1])\n        next_fib = a + b\n        \n        # Update 'a' and 'b' for the next iteration:\n        # 'a' becomes the old 'b' (dp[games_count])\n        # 'b' becomes the new Fibonacci number (dp[games_count + 1])\n        a = b\n        b = next_fib\n        \n        # Increment 'games_count' to reflect the new number of games for 'b'\n        games_count += 1\n    \n    # When the loop exits, 'b' is the first dp value that is strictly greater than 'n'.\n    # This means 'games_count' was incremented one too many times.\n    # The maximum number of games the winner can play is the previous 'games_count',\n    # which is 'games_count - 1'.\n    print(games_count - 1)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
