He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Prefixes and Suffixes\" problem. Here's how I'm thinking about it:**\n\nFirst off, I need to truly understand the problem. I'm given the length of a hidden string, `n`, and a collection of `2n-2` other strings.  These are *all* the possible improper prefixes and suffixes of that hidden string.  Improper means, excluding the whole string itself.  So, I'm dealing with `n-1` prefixes (lengths 1 to `n-1`) and `n-1` suffixes (lengths 1 to `n-1`).\n\nNow, I have a few key observations that jump out.  The crucial part is that for each length `k` (from 1 to `n-1`), *exactly two* strings of that length are given. One's a prefix, and the other's a suffix.  The goal is to determine, for each of the given strings, whether it's a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') of the original string.  There might be multiple valid solutions, but I just need to find *one* consistent one.\n\nHere's my strategy: I'm going to focus on the longest prefix and suffix, which are of length `n-1`. I'll call them `str1` and `str2`. These two strings are absolutely essential.\n\n1.  **Reconstruction:**  If I've got `str1` and `str2`, the original string, `s`, *has* to be related to them.\n    *   One possibility is that `s` is `str1` (the prefix) with the last character of `str2` appended: `s = str1 + str2[-1]`.\n    *   The other is that `s` is `str2` (the suffix) with the first character of `str1` prepended: `s = str2[0] + str1`.\n    *   The catch? These two ways *must* produce a consistent string.  For that to be true, `str1[1:]` (everything but the first character of `str1`) has to be identical to `str2[:-1]` (everything but the last character of `str2`).  If that doesn't hold, I can't reconstruct a valid `s`. If they are the same, `s` is built by `str1` + the last character of `str2`.\n\n2.  **Two Possible Candidates:** Let's give names: Let the two strings of length `n-1` be `L1` and `L2`.\n    *   **Candidate 1:** I assume `L1` is the prefix (so `s` starts with `L1`) and `L2` is the suffix (so `s` ends with a character from `L2`).  The potential `s` is `L1 + L2[-1]`. I check: Is `L1[1:] == L2[:-1]`?  If yes, I've got a candidate, which I'll call `s_candidate1`.\n    *   **Candidate 2:** I assume `L2` is the prefix and `L1` is the suffix.  This makes `s = L2 + L1[-1]`. Again, I check: Is `L2[1:] == L1[:-1]`?  If yes, I have another candidate, `s_candidate2`.\n\n3.  **Verification and Assignment:**  My job is to find a *valid* solution, so I can start with either candidate.\n    *   Let's say `s_candidate1` is valid.  I build it. Then, for every other input string:\n        *   I check if it's a prefix of `s_candidate1`. If so, it's a 'P'.\n        *   Or, I check if it's a suffix of `s_candidate1`. If so, it's an 'S'.\n    *   For each string of length `k`, there should be *exactly one* match in the prefixes of `s_candidate1` and *exactly one* match in the suffixes. I need to make sure I'm assigning 'P' or 'S' once. To achieve that, I will maintain two tracking variables for each string of length k: `prefix_counts` and `suffix_counts`.\n\n4.  **The Algorithm's Steps:**\n    *   I'll read the input: `n` and the `2n-2` strings.\n    *   I store the strings in a structure so I can easily look them up by length, and I remember their original input order.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine, for a given set of `2n-2` strings, which are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that these `2n-2` strings are *all* improper prefixes and suffixes of `s` (i.e., of lengths 1 to `n-1`), and that for each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings of length `k` in the input.\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nThe crucial observation is about the strings of length `n-1`. There are exactly two such strings in the input. These must be:\n1.  The longest improper prefix: `s[0:n-1]`\n2.  The longest improper suffix: `s[1:n]`\n\nLet the two strings of length `n-1` from the input be `L1` and `L2`. We can form two candidate strings for `s`:\n\n*   **Candidate 1:** Assume `L1` is `s[0:n-1]` and `L2` is `s[1:n]`.\n    *   For this to be consistent, the substring `s[1:n-1]` must be common to both. That is, `L1[1:]` must be equal to `L2[:-1]`.\n    *   If consistent, the full string `s` would be `L1 + L2[-1]`.\n*   **Candidate 2:** Assume `L2` is `s[0:n-1]` and `L1` is `s[1:n]`.\n    *   Similarly, `L2[1:]` must be equal to `L1[:-1]`.\n    *   If consistent, the full string `s` would be `L2 + L1[-1]`.\n\nSince the problem guarantees that the input strings correspond to *some* existing string `s`, at least one of these two candidates (if valid) must be the correct `s`. We can try them one by one.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Read Input:**\n    *   Read `n`.\n    *   Store the `2n-2` input strings along with their original indices. This is important for printing the 'P'/'S' string in the correct order.\n    *   Group the input strings by their length. A dictionary `strings_by_length[k]` storing a list of `(string_value, original_index)` for strings of length `k` is useful.\n\n2.  **Identify Longest Strings:**\n    *   Retrieve the two strings of length `n-1` from `strings_by_length[n-1]`. Let them be `(L1_val, L1_idx)` and `(L2_val, L2_idx)`.\n\n3.  **Define a `solve` function:**\n    *   This function will take a candidate string `s_test`, `n`, the `raw_inputs` list, and `strings_by_length` dictionary.\n    *   **Consistency Check:**\n        *   Generate all `n-1` prefixes (`s_test[0:k]`) and `n-1` suffixes (`s_test[n-k:n]`) of `s_test`.\n        *   Count their occurrences (e.g., using a `defaultdict`). This gives `expected_counts`.\n        *   Count the occurrences of all input strings. This gives `input_counts`.\n        *   If `expected_counts` is not equal to `input_counts`, then `s_test` is not a valid candidate. Return `None`.\n    *   **Assign 'P' or 'S':**\n        *   If `s_test` is consistent, we need to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string based on `s_test`.\n        *   Initialize an `ans_chars` list of size `2n-2` with empty strings.\n        *   For each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`:\n            *   Identify the true prefix `P_k = s_test[0:k]` and true suffix `S_k = s_test[n-k:n]`.\n            *   Retrieve the two input strings of length `k` from `strings_by_length[k]`. Let them be `(val1, idx1)` and `(val2, idx2)`.\n            *   We need to assign `P` to one of them and `S` to the other.\n            *   If `val1 == P_k`: Assign `ans_chars[idx1] = 'P'`.\n            *   Else: Assign `ans_chars[idx1] = 'S'`. (This handles cases where `P_k == S_k` or `val1 == S_k`).\n            *   The other string `(val2, idx2)` will take the remaining role.\n            *   If `ans_chars[idx1] == 'P'`: Assign `ans_chars[idx2] = 'S'`.\n            *   Else (`ans_chars[idx1] == 'S'`): Assign `ans_chars[idx2] = 'P'`.\n            *   This logic correctly handles cases where `P_k == S_k` (both input strings are identical) by assigning one 'P' and one 'S'.\n        *   Join `ans_chars` and return the resulting string.\n\n4.  **Main Execution:**\n    *   **Try Candidate 1:**\n        *   If `L1_val[1:] == L2_val[:-1]` (consistency check for forming `s` from `L1` and `L2`):\n            *   Form `s_candidate1 = L1_val + L2_val[-1]`.\n            *   Call `result = solve(s_candidate1, n, raw_inputs, strings_by_length)`.\n            *   If `result` is not `None`, print `result` and exit.\n    *   **Try Candidate 2:**\n        *   If the first candidate didn't work or wasn't valid, try the second:\n        *   If `L2_val[1:] == L1_val[:-1]`:\n            *   Form `s_candidate2 = L2_val + L1_val[-1]`.\n            *   Call `result = solve(s_candidate2, n, raw_inputs, strings_by_length)`.\n            *   If `result` is not `None`, print `result` and exit.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n = 5`\nInput strings (with original indices): `('ba',0), ('a',1), ('abab',2), ('a',3), ('aba',4), ('baba',5), ('ab',6), ('aba',7)`\n\n`strings_by_length`:\n`1: [('a',1), ('a',3)]`\n`2: [('ba',0), ('ab',6)]`\n`3: [('aba',4), ('aba',7)]`\n`4: [('abab',2), ('baba',5)]`\n\nLongest strings (`n-1 = 4`): `L1_val = \"abab\"` (idx 2), `L2_val = \"baba\"` (idx 5).\n\n**Try Candidate 1:** `L1=\"abab\"` as prefix, `L2=\"baba\"` as suffix.\n*   Check `L1[1:] == L2[:-1]`: `\"bab\" == \"bab\"`.
