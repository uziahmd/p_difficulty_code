For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about the \"Multiset of Strings\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to count the ways to set these *c* values (for binary strings up to length *n*) such that the max size of a beautiful multiset is exactly *f*. I see this as building a tree where each node represents a string, and the *c* value limits how many of its descendants we can have in the multiset.\n\nFirst, I need to define a DP. Let's start with `dp[d][val]`. This represents the number of ways to set *c* values for all strings in a subtree of depth *d* (where the root is length *n-d*), such that the *maximum* possible count of strings of length *n* under that root is `val`.\n\n*   Base Case: If `d=0`, we are at a string of length *n* (a leaf). The maximum count is just its *c* value, which can be any value from 0 to *k*. So, `dp[0][val]` is 1 if `0 <= val <= k`, and 0 otherwise.\n\n*   Recursive Step: For `d > 0`, consider a node at depth *n-d* with children. The maximum count under this node is limited by its *c* value and the counts from its children's subtrees. We need to sum over all possible combinations of counts from those children and the possible value for *c* itself, making sure that `min(c, sum of child counts) = val`.\n\nA crucial observation is that this maximum count will never exceed *k*. We will use that to reduce the DP state.\nNow, the tricky part is to actually compute this. The key is polynomial multiplication using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform). The recursive step can be seen as a polynomial convolution; we have to account for it in each state.\n\nSo, let's break it down: For a given depth *d*, we know the DP values for depth `d-1`.\n1.  We need to compute the convolution of the *d-1* values (effectively `dp[d-1]` multiplied by itself, this will yield the counts to pair).\n2.  Then, for each possible *val* (from 0 to *k*), we iterate through all possible combinations for each *c* to meet the `min(c, sum_of_children) = val` constraint.\n3. The answer is found by taking `dp[n][f]`.\n\nThe computational bottleneck is the polynomial multiplication using NTT, but the constraints of *n* and *k* suggest this solution is tractable.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integer values `c_s` for all binary strings `s` of length from 1 to `n` (where `0 <= c_s <= k`), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset of strings of length exactly `n` is exactly `f`.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined for a given set of `c_s` values.\nA multiset `M` of strings of length `n` is beautiful if for every string `s` (length 1 to `n`), the count of strings in `M` having `s` as a prefix does not exceed `c_s`.\n\nConsider a full binary tree of depth `n`. The leaves are strings of length `n`. For any string `s` of length `L < n`, its children are `s0` and `s1`. The strings in `M` that have `s` as a prefix are exactly those that have `s0` as a prefix plus those that have `s1` as a prefix.\nLet `max_count(s)` be the maximum possible number of strings in `M` that have `s` as a prefix, subject to the `c_v` constraints for `v` that are `s` or its descendants.\nIf `s` is a string of length `n` (a leaf in the conceptual tree): `max_count(s) = c_s`.\nIf `s` is a string of length `L < n` (an internal node): `max_count(s) = min(c_s, max_count(s0) + max_count(s1))`.\nA crucial observation is that `max_count(s)` for any `s` is always at most `k`. This is because `c_s <= k` for any `s`. By induction: for leaves `s`, `max_count(s) = c_s <= k`. For an internal node `s`, `max_count(s) = min(c_s, max_count(s0) + max_count(s1))`. Since `c_s <= k`, it follows that `max_count(s) <= k`. This limits the range of values we need to consider.\n\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `max_count(\"\")`, where `\"\"` is the empty string. The empty string is not among the strings `s` for which `c_s` is defined (they are length 1 to `n`). So, `max_count(\"\") = max_count(\"0\") + max_count(\"1\")`.\nHere, `max_count(\"0\")` refers to the maximum count for the subtree rooted at \"0\", and `max_count(\"1\")` for the subtree rooted at \"1\". Both \"0\" and \"1\" are strings of length 1, and they are roots of subtrees of depth `n-1`.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming. Let `dp[d][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s` values for all strings `s` in a full binary subtree of depth `d` (where the root is a string of length `n-d`, and leaves are strings of length `n`), such that the `max_count` for the root of this subtree is `val`.\n\n**Base Case (`d=0`):**\nThis corresponds to a string `s` of length `n`. `max_count(s) = c_s`.\nWe need to choose `c_s = val`. There is 1 way to do this for each `val` from `0` to `k`.\nSo, `dp[0][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\n\n**Recursive Step (`d > 0`):**\nConsider a root `P` of a subtree of depth `d`. Its length is `n-d`.\n`max_count(P) = min(c_P, max_count(P0) + max_count(P1))`.\n`P0` and `P1` are roots of subtrees of depth `d-1`.\nLet `v0 = max_count(P0)` and `v1 = max_count(P1)`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `v0` for `P0`'s subtree is `dp[d-1][v0]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `v1` for `P1`'s subtree is `dp[d-1][v1]`.\nTo calculate `dp[d][val]`, we sum over all possible `v0, v1` (from `0` to `k`) and `c_P` (from `0` to `k`) such that `min(c_P, v0 + v1) = val`.\n\nLet `P_prev[x] = dp[d-1][x]`.\nFirst, compute `conv_P[X] = sum_{v0+v1=X} (P_prev[v0] * P_prev[v1])`. This is a polynomial multiplication (convolution). `X` can range from `0` to `2k`.\n`conv_P[X]` represents the number of ways to choose `c_s` values for the children's subtrees such that `max_count(P0) + max_count(P1) = X`.\nThis can be computed efficiently using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) in `O(k log k)` time. The modulus `998244353` is a prime suitable for NTT.\n\nNow, for each `val` from `0` to `k`:\n`dp[d][val] = sum_{c_P=0 to k} sum_{X=0 to 2k, s.t. min(c_P, X) = val} conv_P[X]`\nThis sum can be broken down:\n1.  If `c_P = val`: `min(val, X) = val` requires `X >= val`. So we sum `conv_P[X]` for `X` from `val` to `2k`.\n2.  If `c_P > val`: `min(c_P, X) = val` requires `X = val`. There are `k - val` choices for `c_P` (`val+1, ..., k`). So we add `(k - val) * conv_P[val]`.\n\nLet `suffix_conv_P[i] = sum_{j=i to 2k} conv_P[j]`. This can be computed in `O(k)` time using suffix sums.\nThen, `dp[d][val] = (suffix_conv_P[val] + (k - val) * conv_P[val]) % MOD`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nAfter computing `dp[n-1]`, this array contains the number of ways to achieve `val` for `max_count(\"0\")` (or `max_count(\"1\")`).\nThe total maximum size for the entire multiset is `max_count(\"0\") + max_count(\"1\")`.\nWe need this sum to be `f`. So the final answer is `sum_{v0+v1=f} (dp[n-1][v0] * dp[n-1][v1])`.\nThis is exactly `final_conv_P[f]` where `final_conv_P = multiply(dp[n-1], dp[n-1])`.\n\n**Overall Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `dp_current = [0] * (k+1)`.\n    For `j` from `0` to `k`: `dp_current[j] = 1`.\n2.  Loop `d` from `1` to `n-1`:\n    a.  Let `P = dp_current`.\n    b.  Compute `conv_P = multiply(P, P)` using NTT. (Resulting polynomial will have degree up to `2k`).\n    c.  Compute `suffix_conv_P` array:\n        `suffix_conv_P = [0] * (2k + 1)`\n        `suffix_conv_P[2k] = conv_P[2k]`\n        For `i` from `2k-1` down to `0`: `suffix_conv_P[i] = (suffix_conv_P[i+1] + conv_P[i]) % MOD`.\n    d.  Initialize `dp_next = [0] * (k+1)`.\n        For `val` from `0` to `k`:\n            `dp_next[val] = (suffix_conv_P[val] + (k - val) * conv_P[val]) % MOD`.\n    e.  Set `dp_current = dp_next`.\n3.  After the loop, `dp_current` holds `dp[n-1]`.\n4.  Compute `final_conv_P = multiply(dp_current, dp_current)`.\n5.  The answer is `final_conv_P[f]` (if `f <= 2k`, otherwise `0`).\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Time: `n-1` iterations. Each iteration involves one NTT-based polynomial multiplication `O(k log k)` and `O(k)` for suffix sums and `dp_next` calculation.
