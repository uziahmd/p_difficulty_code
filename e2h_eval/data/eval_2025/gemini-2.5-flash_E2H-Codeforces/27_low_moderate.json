On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "**Tackling the \"A Twisty Movement\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem presents a sequence of 1s and 2s, and we need to reverse a sub-interval to maximize the length of the Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS).  Given my expertise, the core idea here is that with only 1s and 2s, the LNDS will always be some number of 1s followed by some number of 2s.  Maximizing the LNDS boils down to finding the optimal \"split point\" between the 1s and the 2s after reversing a sub-interval.\n\nThinking through the constraints, the sequence length is manageable, up to 2000, which suggests a brute-force approach is feasible, albeit perhaps not the most elegant. I know that I'll need to iterate through all possible reversal intervals `[l, r]`.\n\nThe key insight is about how to *efficiently* calculate the LNDS length for any modified sequence.  I need to count the 1s before some index `i` and the 2s after that index. The maximum sum of these counts over all possible split points `i` gives me the LNDS length for the current modified sequence.\n\nSo, for each pair of `l` and `r`, I'll reverse that sub-interval, then compute the LNDS length of the modified sequence using the \"split point\" trick described above. The maximum of these LNDS lengths across all `(l, r)` pairs will be the final answer. Seems pretty straightforward. I think I'm ready to code this up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a chosen subsegment `a[l...r]` of the original sequence `a`. The sequence elements `a[i]` can only be 1 or 2.\n\n**Understanding LNDS with only 1s and 2s:**\nA non-decreasing subsequence formed from 1s and 2s will always have the structure `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. This means all chosen 1s must appear before all chosen 2s in the sequence.\nTo maximize the length of such a subsequence, we can iterate through all possible \"split points\" `i` (from `0` to `n`). For each `i`, we consider forming an LNDS by taking all 1s in the prefix `b[0...i-1]` and all 2s in the suffix `b[i...n-1]`. The sum of these counts gives a potential LNDS length. The maximum of these sums over all `i` is the actual LNDS length for the sequence `b`.\n\nLet `b` be the sequence after reversing `a[l...r]`.\nThe LNDS length for `b` can be calculated as `max_{0 <= i <= n} (count of 1s in b[0...i-1] + count of 2s in b[i...n-1])`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\nSince `n` is up to 2000, an `O(N^3)` solution would be too slow (`2000^3 = 8 * 10^9`). An `O(N^2)` solution (`2000^2 = 4 * 10^6`) would be acceptable.\n\nWe can iterate through all possible pairs `(l, r)` for the reversal interval. There are `O(N^2)` such pairs.\nFor each `(l, r)`:\n1. Create the modified sequence `b`. This involves copying `a[0...l-1]`, reversing `a[l...r]`, and copying `a[r+1...n-1]`. This takes `O(N)` time.\n2. Calculate the LNDS of `b`. This also takes `O(N)` time using the split point method described above.\n\nThe overall complexity would be `O(N^2 * N) = O(N^3)`, which is too slow. We need to optimize step 2 or how we handle `(l, r)` pairs.\n\n**Optimized LNDS Calculation:**\nLet's fix `l` and `r`.\nThe sequence `b` looks like: `a[0...l-1]` | `reversed(a[l...r])` | `a[r+1...n-1]`.\nLet `prefix_ones[k]` be the count of 1s in `a[0...k-1]`.\nLet `suffix_twos[k]` be the count of 2s in `a[k...n-1]`.\nThese can be precomputed in `O(N)` time.\n\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`, and a split point `i`:\n- If `i <= l`: The prefix `b[0...i-1]` is `a[0...i-1]`. The count of 1s is `prefix_ones[i]`.\n- If `i > r`: The suffix `b[i...n-1]` is `a[i...n-1]`. The count of 2s is `suffix_twos[i]`.\n\nThe tricky part is when the split point `i` falls within `[l, r]`.\nLet's analyze the contribution of 1s and 2s from the three parts of `b`:\n1. `a[0...l-1]` (left part)\n2. `reversed(a[l...r])` (middle part)\n3. `a[r+1...n-1]` (right part)\n\nAn LNDS will pick some 1s from the left part, some 1s from the middle part (if they come before 2s from the middle part), some 2s from the middle part (if they come after 1s from the middle part), and some 2s from the right part.\n\nLet's fix the split point `i`.\nThe number of 1s in `b[0...i-1]` is:\n- `prefix_ones[i]` if `i <= l`.\n- `prefix_ones[l] + (count of 1s in reversed(a[l...i-1]))` if `l < i <= r`.\n- `prefix_ones[l] + (count of 1s in reversed(a[l...r])) + (count of 1s in a[r+1...i-1])` if `i > r`.\n\nThe number of 2s in `b[i...n-1]` is:\n- `suffix_twos[i]` if `i > r`.\n- `suffix_twos[r+1] + (count of 2s in reversed(a[i...r]))` if `l <= i <= r`.\n- `suffix_twos[r+1] + (count of 2s in reversed(a[l...r])) + (count of 2s in a[i...l-1])` if `i < l`.\n\nThis still looks complicated. A simpler approach for the `O(N^2)` solution:\n\nIterate `l` from `0` to `n-1`.\nIterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\n\nFor each `(l, r)` pair:\n1. Initialize `current_ones = 0`.\n2. Initialize `current_twos = 0`.\n3. Calculate `max_lnds_for_lr = 0`.\n\n4. Iterate `i` from `0` to `n-1` (this `i` is the split point, or the end of the 1s part).\n   - If `i < l`: `current_ones` counts 1s in `a[0...i]`. `current_twos` counts 2s in `a[i+1...l-1]` (original), then `reversed(a[l...r])`, then `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n   - If `l <= i <= r`: `current_ones` counts 1s in `a[0...l-1]` (original) and `reversed(a[l...i])`. `current_twos` counts 2s in `reversed(a[i+1...r])` and `a[r+1...n-1]` (original).\n   - If `i > r`: `current_ones` counts 1s in `a[0...l-1]` (original), `reversed(a[l...r])`, and `a[r+1...i]`. `current_twos` counts 2s in `a[i+1...n-1]` (original).\n\nThis is still effectively constructing `b` and then calculating LNDS.\nThe key insight is that the LNDS will be formed by:\n(1s in `a[0...l-1]`) + (1s in `reversed(a[l...k])` + 2s in `reversed(a[k+1...r])` for some `k` in `[l-1, r]`) + (2s in `a[r+1...n-1]`).\n\nLet's precompute:\n- `pref1[i]`: count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`. `pref1[0]=0`.\n- `suff2[i]`: count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`. `suff2[n]=0`.\n\nFor each `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n  For each `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n    `current_lnds = 0`\n    `ones_in_middle = 0`\n    `twos_in_middle = 0`\n\n    // Calculate LNDS considering only the middle part `reversed(a[l...r])`\n    // This part iterates through potential split points `k` within `[l, r]`\n    // `k` represents the index in the *original* array `a`.\n    // If `a[k]` is 1, it becomes a 1 in `reversed(a[l...r])` if `k` is after the split point for the reversed segment.\n    // If `a[k]` is 2, it becomes a 2 in `reversed(a[l...r])` if `k` is before the split point for the reversed segment.\n    \n    // Let's count 1s and 2s in the reversed segment `a[l...r]`\n    // The elements are `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]`\n    // We want to find `max_k ( (count of 1s in a[r...k]) + (count of 2s in a[k-1...l]) )`\n    // where `k` goes from `r` down to `l-1`.\n    \n    `max_middle_ones_twos = 0`\n    `current_middle_ones = 0`\n    \n    // Iterate `k` from `r` down to `l`. `k` is the original index.\n    // `a[k]` is now at position `l + (r-k)` in the reversed segment.\n    // We are effectively iterating through split points in the reversed segment.\n    // Let `split_idx` be the index in the reversed segment where 1s end and 2s begin.\n    // `split_idx` goes from `l` to `r+1`.\n    // If `split_idx = l`, means all elements in `reversed(a[l...r])` are 2s.\n    // If `split_idx = r+1`, means all elements in `reversed(a[l...r])` are 1s.\n\n    // Let `ones_in_reversed_prefix` be count of 1s in `a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[k]`\n    // Let `twos_in_reversed_suffix` be count of 2s in `a[k-1], ..., a[l]`\n    \n    // `temp_ones_in_middle` will count 1s from `a[r]` down to `a[i]`.\n    // `temp_twos_in_middle` will count 2s from `a[i-1]` down to `a[l]`.\n    \n    `temp_twos_in_middle = 0`\n    for `k` from `l` to `r`:\n        if `a[k] == 2`:\n            `temp_twos_in_middle += 1`\n    \n    `max_middle_segment_lnds = temp_twos_in_middle` // Case where all elements in reversed segment are 2s.\n    \n    `temp_ones_in_middle = 0`\n    for `k` from `r` down to `l`: // `k` is original index, processing from right to left (reversed order)\n        if `a[k] == 1`:\n            `temp_ones_in_middle += 1`\n        else: // `a[k] == 2`\n            `temp_twos_in_middle -= 1`\n        `max_middle_segment_lnds = max(max_middle_segment_lnds, temp_ones_in_middle + temp_twos_in_middle)`\n\n    // Now, `max_middle_segment_lnds` holds the maximum LNDS we can get *just from the middle segment*.\n    // The total LNDS is `pref1[l] + max_middle_segment_lnds + suff2[r+1]`.\n    `max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, pref1[l] + max_middle_segment_lnds + suff2[r+1])`\n\nThis approach has `O(N^2)` pairs of `(l, r)`.\nFor each pair, calculating `max_middle_segment_lnds` takes `O(N)` time.\nTotal complexity: `O(N^3)`. Still too slow.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate the LNDS structure for an `O(N^2)` approach:**\n\nThe LNDS will be `1...1` (from `a[0...l-1]`) `1...1` (from `reversed(a[l...r])`) `2...2` (from `reversed(a[l...r])`) `2...2` (from `a[r+1...n-1]`).\n\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`:\nThe number of 1s taken from `a[0...l-1]` is `pref1[l]`.\nThe number of 2s taken from `a[r+1...n-1]` is `suff2[r+1]`.\n\nWhat remains is to find the maximum `(count of 1s from reversed(a[l...k]) + count of 2s from reversed(a[k+1...r]))` for `l-1 <= k <= r`.\nLet the reversed segment be `b_mid = [a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l]`.\nWe need to find `max_{0 <= j <= (r-l+1)} (count of 1s in b_mid[0...j-1] + count of 2s in b_mid[j...r-l])`.\nThis is a standard LNDS calculation on a subsegment, which takes `O(length_of_segment) = O(N)`.\n\nSo, the `O(N^3)` approach is correct. The `N=2000` constraint is tight for `N^3`.\nIs it possible that `N=2000` is for `O(N^2)` or `O(N^2 log N)`?\nCompetitive programming problems often have `N=2000` for `O(N^2)`.\n\nLet's check the example: `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, `n=4`.\n`pref1 = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`\n`suff2 = [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]`\n\nTry `l=1, r=2` (0-indexed: `l=1, r=2`). `a[1...2]` is `[2, 1]`. Reversed is `[1, 2]`.\nNew array: `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.\n`pref1[l] = pref1[1] = 1`. (1s from `a[0...0]`)\n`suff2[r+1] = suff2[3] = 1`. (2s from `a[3...3]`)\nMiddle segment `a[1...2]` is `[2, 1]`. Reversed is `[1, 2]`.\nLNDS of `[1, 2]` is 2. (1 from `a[1]`, 2 from `a[2]`).\nTotal LNDS = `pref1[1]` + LNDS of `[1, 2]` + `suff2[3]` = `1 + 2 + 1 = 4`. This matches the example.\n\nLet's try `a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]`, `n=10`.\n`l=3, r=7` (0-indexed: `l=2, r=6`). `a[2...6]` is `[2, 2, 2, 1, 1]`. Reversed is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`.\nNew array: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]`.\n`pref1[l] = pref1[2] = 2`. (1s from `a[0...1]`)\n`suff2[r+1] = suff2[7] = 2`. (2s from `a[7...9]`)\nMiddle segment `a[2...6]` is `[2, 2, 2, 1, 1]`. Reversed is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`.\nLNDS of `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]` is 5. (Two 1s, three 2s).\nTotal LNDS = `pref1[2]` + LNDS of `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]` + `suff2[7]` = `2 + 5 + 2 = 9`. This matches the example.\n\nIt seems the `O(N^3)` approach is what is expected. Why would `N=2000` work for `N^3`?\n`2000^3 = 8 * 10^9` operations. This is definitely too slow.\nA typical limit for 1 second is `10^8` operations.\n\nThere must be a way to calculate `max_middle_segment_lnds` in `O(1)` or `O(N)` total for all `r` for a fixed `l`.\n\nLet's fix `l`. We iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\nWhen `r` increases by 1, `a[r]` is added to the middle segment.\n`reversed(a[l...r])` becomes `reversed(a[l...r-1])` followed by `a[r]`.\nSo `b_mid` changes from `[a_{r-1}, ..., a_l]` to `[a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l]`.\nThis means we prepend `a_r` to `b_mid`.\n\nLet `f(sub_array)` be the LNDS of `sub_array`.\nWe want to calculate `f([a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l])`.\nLet `dp[k]` be the LNDS of `[a_k, a_{k-1}, ..., a_l]`.\nWhen we go from `r` to `r+1`, we need `f([a_{r+1}, a_r, ..., a_l])`.\nThis looks like a dynamic programming approach.\n\nFor a fixed `l`:\nInitialize `max_middle_segment_lnds = 0`.\nInitialize `ones_in_reversed = 0`.\nInitialize `twos_in_reversed = 0`.\n\nFor `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n  Consider `a[r]`. It is added to the *front* of the reversed segment.\n  If `a[r] == 1`:\n    `ones_in_reversed += 1`.\n  Else (`a[r] == 2`):\n    `twos_in_reversed += 1`.\n\n  Now we need to calculate LNDS for `[a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l]`.\n  Let `current_ones_prefix = 0`.\n  Let `current_twos_suffix = twos_in_reversed`.\n  `max_val_for_this_r = current_twos_suffix`. // Case where all elements are 2s.\n\n  For `k` from `r` down to `l`: // iterate through original indices `k` from right to left\n    // `a[k]` is the element we are considering.\n    // If `a[k]` is 1, it contributes to `current_ones_prefix`.\n    // If `a[k]` is 2, it contributes to `current_twos_suffix`.\n    // When we move `k` from `r` down to `l`, we are effectively moving the split point.\n    // `a[k]` moves from `current_twos_suffix` to `current_ones_prefix`.\n    if `a[k] == 1`:\n      `current_ones_prefix += 1`\n    else: // `a[k] == 2`\n      `current_twos_suffix -= 1`\n    `max_val_for_this_r = max(max_val_for_this_r, current_ones_prefix + current_twos_suffix)`\n\n  `max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, pref1[l] + max_val_for_this_r + suff2[r+1])`\n\nThis is exactly the `O(N^3)` approach described before. The inner loop `for k from r down to l` makes it `N` operations for each `(l,r)` pair.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem statement and constraints.\n`N=2000`, `a_i` is 1 or 2.\nAn LNDS is `1...12...2`.\nThe total length of the sequence is `N`.\nThe length of the LNDS is at most `N`.\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS length is `N`. This happens if the entire sequence is `1...12...2`.\nIf the array is already sorted `1...12...2`, then the LNDS is `N`.\nIf we reverse `[l,r]` and it becomes `1...12...2`, then the LNDS is `N`.\n\nWhat if we fix the split point `k` for the final LNDS?\nThe LNDS will be `(count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`.\nWe need to maximize this over all `l, r, k`.\nIterate `k` from `0` to `n`.\nFor a fixed `k`:\nWe want to maximize `(count of 1s in b[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...n-1])`.\n\nLet `ones_before_k(l, r)` be the count of 1s in `b[0...k-1]`.\nLet `twos_after_k(l, r)` be the count of 2s in `b[k...n-1]`.\n\nCase 1: `k <= l`.\n  `ones_before_k = pref1[k]`.\n  `twos_after_k = (count of 2s in reversed(a[l...r])) + suff2[r+1]` (if `k <= l` and `k <= r`).\n  `twos_after_k = (count of 2s in reversed(a[l...r])) + (count of 2s in a[r+1...n-1])`\n  This is `twos_after_k = (total 2s in a[l...r]) + suff2[r+1]`\n  No, it's `twos_after_k = (count of 2s in a[l...r] in original order) + suff2[r+1]`.\n  This is because `a[l...r]` is reversed, so the 2s originally in `a[l...r]` now appear *before* the 1s originally in `a[l...r]`.\n  So `count of 2s in reversed(a[l...r])` is simply the total count of 2s in `a[l...r]`.\n  Let `total_ones[i][j]` be count of 1s in `a[i...j]`.\n  Let `total_twos[i][j]` be count of 2s in `a[i...j]`.\n\n  If `k <= l`:\n    `ones_before_k = pref1[k]`.\n    `twos_after_k = total_twos[l][r] + suff2[r+1]`.\n    We want to maximize `pref1[k] + total_twos[l][r] + suff2[r+1]`.\n    For a fixed `k`, `pref1[k]` is fixed. We need to maximize `total_twos[l][r] + suff2[r+1]`.\n    This means we should choose `l, r` such that `l >= k`.\n    For each `l`, we can maximize `total_twos[l][r] + suff2[r+1]` by choosing `r`.\n    This can be done in `O(N)` for each `l`.\n    `max_val = max(max_val, pref1[k] + max_{l>=k, r>=l} (total_twos[l][r] + suff2[r+1]))`.\n\nCase 2: `k > r`.\n  `ones_before_k = pref1[l] + total_ones[l][r] + pref1[k] - pref1[r+1]`.\n  `twos_after_k = suff2[k]`.\n  We want to maximize `pref1[l] + total_ones[l][r] + (pref1[k]-pref1[r+1]) + suff2[k]`.\n  For a fixed `k`, `suff2[k]` is fixed.
