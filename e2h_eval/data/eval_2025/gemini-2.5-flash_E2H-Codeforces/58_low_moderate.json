You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Odd Cycle Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of edges, `t`, I need to add to a graph to create a simple odd-length cycle, and then count the number of ways, `w`, to do this. My initial thought process is to consider a few cases.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the conditions for an odd cycle: it has to be a cycle, it has to be odd length, it has to be simple (no repeated vertices), and it has to have more than one vertex. Adding more edges cannot form loops or parallel edges.\n\nI figure the most efficient strategy will be to check from the smallest possible value for `t` upwards.  I start with `t=0`.\n\n**Case 1: `t = 0` - The Already Odd Cycle**\n\nThe first thing I'll check is if the graph already has an odd cycle. If the original graph *is* non-bipartite, then I only need to add `t=0` edges and count it as one valid solution. Checking for an odd cycle is easily done. I can do this using BFS or DFS and two-coloring the graph. If I find a conflict during the color assignment – two adjacent vertices with the same color – I know I've found an odd cycle, meaning `t` is 0, and the number of ways, `w`, is at least 1.\n\nIf the graph *is* bipartite, then an odd cycle doesn't exist. Now I consider a larger value for `t`.\n\n**Case 2: `t = 1` - Adding a Single Edge**\n\nIf the graph *is* bipartite, it means `t` has to be greater than zero. So, I will proceed with `t=1`. I'll consider adding only one edge. If I add a single edge and make the graph non-bipartite, then I've achieved the desired outcome. The added edge has to join two vertices within the same connected component and the same partition in the bipartite graph.\n\nAdding an edge across connected components, or adding an edge between vertices with different colors within the same component, creates an even-length cycle and maintains the bipartite structure, which is not what I'm after.\n\nTo find the number of ways to add an edge to make an odd cycle when `t=1`, I'll need to look at each connected component individually. If a component is bipartite, I can perform a two-coloring. I'll split each component into two sets, `S0` and `S1`. Any new edge connecting two vertices within the same set, either `S0` or `S1`, will form an odd cycle. I can determine this by adding any pair of vertices that are the same color. For the first set, the number of such ways is `N_0 * (N_0 - 1) / 2`, where `N_0` is the size of `S0`. Similarly for the other set, it's `N_1 * (N_1 - 1) / 2`, where `N_1` is the size of `S1`. The total number of ways would be the sum of these numbers across all connected components. This count will represent `w` when `t=1`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of edges `t` to add to a given graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and `w` - the number of ways to do so.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values of `t`:\n\n**Case 0: `t = 0`**\nAn odd cycle already exists in the graph. This is true if and only if the graph is not bipartite.\nWe can check for bipartiteness using BFS or DFS. During traversal, we assign colors (e.g., 0 and 1) to vertices. If we find an edge connecting two vertices of the same color, an odd cycle exists.\nIf an odd cycle is found, `t=0` and `w=1` (we just need to confirm its existence, not count all of them).\n\n**Case 1: `t = 1`**\nIf the graph is bipartite (no odd cycles exist initially), we need to add one edge `(u, v)` to create an odd cycle.\nIn a bipartite graph, each connected component can be 2-colored. Let's say vertices are partitioned into two sets, `S0` and `S1`. An edge `(u, v)` creates an odd cycle if and only if `u` and `v` are in the same connected component and belong to the same partition set (i.e., both in `S0` or both in `S1`).\nWe iterate through all connected components. For each component, perform a 2-coloring. Let `N_0` be the count of vertices in `S0` and `N_1` be the count of vertices in `S1`. The number of pairs `(u, v)` within `S0` is `N_0 * (N_0 - 1) / 2`. The number of pairs `(u, v)` within `S1` is `N_1 * (N_1 - 1) / 2`.\nThe total number of such pairs is `N_0 * (N_0 - 1) / 2 + N_1 * (N_1 - 1) / 2`.\nFrom this count, we must subtract any existing edges `(u, v)` where `u` and `v` are in the same partition set. However, since the graph is bipartite, all existing edges connect vertices from different partition sets (`S0` to `S1`). So, no such subtraction is needed.\nThus, `w` for `t=1` is the sum of `(N_0 * (N_0 - 1) / 2 + N_1 * (N_1 - 1) / 2)` over all connected components.\nIf this `w > 0`, then `t=1`.\n\n**Case 2: `t = 2`**\nIf `t=0` and `t=1` are not possible, the graph is bipartite, and for every connected component, all vertices are isolated (i.e., `N_0 <= 1` or `N_1 <= 1`), or `N_0 * (N_0 - 1) / 2 + N_1 * (N_1 - 1) / 2 = 0`. This implies that each connected component has at most one vertex in one of its partition sets, meaning it's a star graph or a path of length at most 1. In such components, no two vertices exist in the same partition set, so no `t=1` odd cycle can be formed.\nIn this case, we need to add two edges.\nThe only way to form an odd cycle with two edges in a bipartite graph is to connect two distinct connected components.\nSuppose we have `k` connected components. Let `C_1, C_2, ..., C_k` be the components.\nWe need to pick two distinct components, say `C_i` and `C_j`.\nPick a vertex `u` from `C_i` and `v` from `C_j`. Add edge `(u, v)`.\nPick another vertex `x` from `C_i` and `y` from `C_j`. Add edge `(x, y)`.\nTo form an odd cycle, `u` and `x` must be of the same color in `C_i`, and `v` and `y` must be of the same color in `C_j`.\nThis means we need to pick two vertices from `C_i` that are in the same partition set, and two vertices from `C_j` that are in the same partition set. Then add edges `(u, v)` and `(x, y)`. This forms a path `v -- u -- x -- y`. If `u` and `x` are same color, and `v` and `y` are same color, then `u` and `v` are different colors, and `x` and `y` are different colors. The path `u -- v -- y -- x` has length 3, which is odd. This forms an odd cycle `u-v-y-x-u`.\nThis requires at least two vertices in `C_i` with the same color, and at least two vertices in `C_j` with the same color. This situation is covered by `t=1` if `C_i` or `C_j` were considered alone.\nThe actual `t=2` case is simpler: pick any two distinct components `C_i` and `C_j`. Let `N_i` be the number of vertices in `C_i` and `N_j` be the number of vertices in `C_j`. We can add an edge `(u, v)` where `u \\in C_i, v \\in C_j`. Then we add another edge `(x, y)` where `x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j`. If `u, x` are distinct and `v, y` are distinct, this forms a 4-cycle. If `u=x` or `v=y`, it forms a 3-cycle.\nThe simplest way to form an odd cycle with two edges connecting two components is to pick two vertices `u, x` from one component `C_i` and one vertex `v` from another component `C_j`. Add edges `(u, v)` and `(x, v)`. This forms a 3-cycle `u-v-x-u`.\nThis requires `C_i` to have at least two vertices, and `C_j` to have at least one vertex.\nIf there are `k` connected components, and at least two of them have more than one vertex:\nLet `C_i` be a component with `N_i` vertices and `C_j` be a component with `N_j` vertices.\nNumber of ways to pick `u, x` from `C_i` is `N_i * (N_i - 1) / 2`.\nNumber of ways to pick `v` from `C_j` is `N_j`.\nSo, for a pair of components `(C_i, C_j)`, there are `(N_i * (N_i - 1) / 2) * N_j` ways to form a 3-cycle using `(u,v)` and `(x,v)`.\nAnd `(N_j * (N_j - 1) / 2) * N_i` ways using `(u,v)` and `(u,x)`.\nSumming this over all pairs of distinct components `(C_i, C_j)` where `N_i >= 2` and `N_j >= 1`.\nThe total number of ways `w` for `t=2` is `(sum_{i=1 to k} N_i * (N_i - 1) / 2) * (sum_{j=1 to k} N_j) - (sum_{i=1 to k} N_i * (N_i - 1) / 2 * N_i)`.\nThis simplifies to `(sum N_i * (N_i - 1) / 2) * (sum N_j) - (sum N_i^2 * (N_i - 1) / 2)`.\nLet `S_2 = sum N_i * (N_i - 1) / 2` and `S_1 = sum N_i`.\nThen `w = S_2 * S_1 - sum (N_i * (N_i - 1) / 2 * N_i)`.\nIf `w > 0`, then `t=2`.\n\n**Case 3: `t = 3`**\nIf `t=0, 1, 2` are not possible, it means:\n1. The graph is bipartite.\n2. For `t=1`, no component has `N_0 >= 2` and `N_1 >= 2`. This implies each component is a path of length at most 1 (an edge or an isolated vertex).\n3. For `t=2`, there are not enough vertices to pick two from one component and one from another, as described above. This means `S_2 = 0`, which means `N_i * (N_i - 1) / 2 = 0` for all `i`. This implies `N_i <= 1` for all `i`.\nSo, if `t=0, 1, 2` are not possible, it means all vertices are isolated. The graph is `n` isolated vertices.\nIn this scenario, we must add three edges to form a 3-cycle. We pick three distinct vertices `u, v, x` and add edges `(u, v), (v, x), (x, u)`.\nThe number of ways to pick 3 vertices from `n` vertices is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6`.\nThis requires `n >= 3`. If `n < 3`, it's impossible to form a cycle. The problem states \"more than one vertex\", which implies `n >= 3` for a 3-cycle.\nIf `n >= 3`, then `t=3` and `w = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initialize:** `visited` array, `colors` array (for 2-coloring), `adj` list for graph.\n2.  **Bipartiteness Check and Component Analysis:**\n    Iterate `i` from 1 to `n`.
