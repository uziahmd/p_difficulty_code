The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Strategy for Chest-Opening Optimization**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem, and my goal is clear: maximize the number of chests opened.  The core idea hinges on this parity condition: a chest opens only if the sum of its number and the key's number is odd.  That immediately tells me I'm dealing with even and odd numbers. I need a key of *opposite* parity to a chest to successfully open it.  My mind instantly breaks this down into two distinct groups: even chests/odd keys and odd chests/even keys.\n\nI'm thinking, let's categorize things. I'll need to count how many even and odd chests and keys I have: `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd`. That should set me up to figure out the maximum number of matches for each type.\n\nThe even chests are only going to be opened by odd keys, and vice versa.  These matches are *independent* of each other.  So, I can treat each pairing separately.  For even chests and odd keys, I'm limited by the smaller of the two counts: `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.  I can't open more chests than I have keys or vice-versa.  The same logic applies to odd chests and even keys; the maximum here is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince these two types of matches are independent, the total number of chests opened is simply the sum of these two maximums:  `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.  This is it! This should be the solution.  Let's quickly verify with a test case to ensure the logic holds. Yup, the example confirms the solution.  I've got this!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open. We are given `n` chests with numbers `a_i` and `m` keys with numbers `b_j`. A key `j` can unlock chest `i` if and only if the sum `a_i + b_j` is an odd number. Each key can be used at most once, and each chest can be opened at most once.\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}` means that `a_i` and `b_j` must have different parities.\nThis implies two possible scenarios for a successful match:\n1. An even-numbered chest (`a_i` is even) must be opened by an odd-numbered key (`b_j` is odd).\n2. An odd-numbered chest (`a_i` is odd) must be opened by an even-numbered key (`b_j` is even).\n\nTo maximize the total number of opened chests, we can count the number of even and odd chests, and the number of even and odd keys separately.\n\nLet's define:\n- `chests_even`: the count of chests with an even number.\n- `chests_odd`: the count of chests with an odd number.\n- `keys_even`: the count of keys with an even number.\n- `keys_odd`: the count of keys with an odd number.\n\nThe maximum number of even chests that can be opened by odd keys is limited by the available count of both. We have `chests_even` even chests and `keys_odd` odd keys. Each odd key can open at most one even chest, and each even chest can be opened by at most one odd key. Therefore, the maximum number of matches of this type is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum number of odd chests that can be opened by even keys is `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nSince using an odd key for an even chest does not affect the availability of even keys for odd chests (and vice-versa, as the parities are distinct), these two types of matches are independent. Thus, the total maximum number of chests Neko can open is the sum of these two maximums.\n\nTotal maximum chests = `min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Read `n` and `m`.\n2. Initialize `chests_even = 0`, `chests_odd = 0`.\n3. Read the `n` chest numbers `a_i`. For each `a_i`, if `a_i % 2 == 0`, increment `chests_even`; otherwise, increment `chests_odd`.\n4. Initialize `keys_even = 0`, `keys_odd = 0`.\n5. Read the `m` key numbers `b_j`. For each `b_j`, if `b_j % 2 == 0`, increment `keys_even`; otherwise, increment `keys_odd`.\n6. Calculate `result = min(chests_even, keys_odd) + min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.\n7. Print `result`.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it only requires iterating through the chest numbers once and the key numbers once, performing constant time operations for each number. The time complexity will be O(n + m), which is well within limits for n, m up to 10^5.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    chests_even = 0\n    chests_odd = 0\n    for x in a:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            chests_even += 1\n        else:\n            chests_odd += 1\n\n    keys_even = 0\n    keys_odd = 0\n    for x in b:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            keys_even += 1\n        else:\n            keys_odd += 1\n\n    # An even chest needs an odd key.\n    # An odd chest needs an even key.\n    \n    # Max matches for even chests with odd keys\n    matches1 = min(chests_even, keys_odd)\n    \n    # Max matches for odd chests with even keys\n    matches2 = min(chests_odd, keys_even)\n    \n    print(matches1 + matches2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
