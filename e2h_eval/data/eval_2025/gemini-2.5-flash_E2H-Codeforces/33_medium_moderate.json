You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Replacing Digits to Maximize a Number**\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem where I need to take a number, represented as a string of digits, and replace some of its digits with digits from a given sequence, also as a string. The goal is to maximize the resulting number, and each digit from the replacement sequence can only be used once.\n\nMy brain immediately goes for a greedy approach. To get the largest possible number, I need to make the leftmost digits as large as possible. This means I'll iterate through the original number from left to right. For each digit, I'll check if I can improve it by replacing it with a larger digit from the replacement sequence.\n\nTo make things easy, I'll convert the original number into a list of characters since I'll be modifying it. The key is how to choose the right digit from the replacement sequence. I'll sort the replacement digits in descending order. This way, the largest available digit is always at the beginning.\n\nHere's the algorithm: I have a pointer, `s_ptr`, initialized to the beginning of the sorted replacement sequence. I iterate through the digits of the original number. For each digit `a[i]`, I compare it with the largest available digit from the sorted replacement sequence (`s_list[s_ptr]`). If the digit from the replacement sequence is strictly larger than `a[i]`, I replace `a[i]` with it and increment `s_ptr` to move to the next digit in the replacement sequence. If the replacement digit is not larger than `a[i]`, I leave `a[i]` as it is. Crucially, I **do not** increment `s_ptr` in this case because it could be useful later on. This is where the greedy part comes in, I am trying to find the best possible replacement for the current digit, but this means there might be other positions in `a_list` where this digit can be swapped out. I can hold the digit for later by not incrementing `s_ptr`, if that's the greedy choice. I stop iterating through digits in the sequence when `s_ptr` goes outside the bounds of the sequence. Then, I rejoin the list of digits into a string.\nAfter writing and testing that program, I did a more thorough examination of some other edge cases to ensure the logic still functions as intended. The strategy is to iteratively find the best replacement and use it if it exists. If it doesn't, no replacement is made. This continues until there are no remaining digits from the replacement sequence, in which case the best result will have been found. The overall logic seems sound.\n",
