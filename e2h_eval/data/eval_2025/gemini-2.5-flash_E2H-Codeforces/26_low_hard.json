Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Counting Non-Degenerate Triangles: An Efficient Approach**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides. The sides are `x`, `y`, and `z`, and they're constrained: `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`. The critical condition for a non-degenerate triangle is `x + y > z`, right? And knowing what I do about the problem space, the other triangle inequalities (`x + z > y` and `y + z > x`) will automatically be satisfied given the ordering and constraints on `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\nI quickly realize that a brute-force triple nested loop would be a disaster in terms of runtime. With D potentially reaching 500,000, that `O(n^3)` approach would be far too slow. I need to be smarter about this.\n\nThe key is to iterate over `x` and `y` and then efficiently compute the number of valid `z` values for each pair. For fixed values of `x` and `y`, the conditions on `z` are: `C <= z <= D` and `x + y > z`. Combining these constraints, I can see that `C <= z < x + y`.  So I need to find the number of integers that fit that range.\n\nThis gives me the form `C <= z < min(D + 1, x + y)`. Therefore, the number of valid `z` values is `max(0, min(D + 1, x + y) - C)`.\n\nSo, the total count should be the sum over all possible combinations of `x` (from A to B) and `y` (from B to C) of that result.  The formula then becomes: `sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`. I think this will be much more efficient! I can implement this with two nested loops, and the calculation within each loop should be quick. I'm pretty confident this is the way to go.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x, y, z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The triangle inequality states that for a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third side. That is:\n1. $x + y > z$\n2. $x + z > y$\n3. $y + z > x$\n\nGiven the constraints $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$, we can simplify these conditions.\nSince $x \\geq A \\geq 1$, $y \\geq B$, and $z \\geq C$:\n- $x + z > y$: We know $z \\geq C$ and $y \\leq C$. If $z > y$, then $x+z > y$ is true since $x \\geq 1$. If $z=y$, then $x+z > y$ becomes $x+y > y$, which simplifies to $x > 0$, also true. So this condition is always satisfied.\n- $y + z > x$: We know $y \\geq B$ and $z \\geq C$. Since $C \\geq B$, $y+z \\geq B+C$. We also know $x \\leq B$. Since $C \\geq B \\geq A \\geq 1$, $B+C > B \\geq x$. So this condition is always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to check is $x + y > z$.\n\nSo we need to count integer triples $(x, y, z)$ satisfying:\n1. $A \\leq x \\leq B$\n2. $B \\leq y \\leq C$\n3. $C \\leq z \\leq D$\n4. $x + y > z$ (or $z \\leq x+y-1$)\n\nWe can iterate over possible values of $x$ and $y$. For each pair $(x, y)$, we need to count the number of $z$ values that satisfy $C \\leq z \\leq D$ and $z \\leq x+y-1$.\nCombining these, $z$ must satisfy $C \\leq z \\leq \\min(D, x+y-1)$.\nThe number of such $z$ values is $\\max(0, \\min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)$.\n\nA naive solution would be to iterate $x$ from $A$ to $B$, $y$ from $B$ to $C$, and for each $(x, y)$ calculate the count of $z$.\nThe maximum value for $D$ is $5 \\cdot 10^5$. The ranges can be up to $5 \\cdot 10^5$. A nested loop for $x$ and $y$ would be $O((B-A+1)(C-B+1))$, which can be up to $O((5 \\cdot 10^5)^2) = O(2.5 \\cdot 10^{11})$, too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach. Let's fix $x$ and iterate $y$.\nFor a fixed $x$, $y$ ranges from $B$ to $C$.\nThe condition $z \\leq x+y-1$ means that the upper bound for $z$ depends on $y$.\nLet $S = x+y$. The sum $S$ ranges from $x+B$ to $x+C$.\nFor a fixed $x$, as $y$ increases by 1, $S$ increases by 1.\nThe number of valid $z$ for a given $S$ (i.e., for $x+y$) is $\\max(0, \\min(D, S-1) - C + 1)$.\n\nLet $f(S) = \\max(0, \\min(D, S-1) - C + 1)$. We need to calculate $\\sum_{x=A}^{B} \\sum_{y=B}^{C} f(x+y)$.\nThe possible values for $S = x+y$ range from $A+B$ to $B+C$.\nLet's rewrite the sum as $\\sum_{S=A+B}^{B+C} (\\text{count of pairs } (x,y) \\text{ such that } x+y=S \\text{ and } A \\leq x \\leq B, B \\leq y \\leq C) \\cdot f(S)$.\n\nThe number of pairs $(x,y)$ such that $x+y=S$ and $A \\leq x \\leq B, B \\leq y \\leq C$ can be found as follows:\nGiven $x+y=S$, $y=S-x$.\nThe constraints become:\n$A \\leq x \\leq B$\n$B \\leq S-x \\leq C \\Rightarrow S-C \\leq x \\leq S-B$\n\nCombining these, $x$ must satisfy $\\max(A, S-C) \\leq x \\leq \\min(B, S-B)$.\nLet $x_{min} = \\max(A, S-C)$ and $x_{max} = \\min(B, S-B)$.\nThe number of such $x$ values (and thus pairs $(x,y)$ for a given $S$) is $\\max(0, x_{max} - x_{min} + 1)$.\nLet this count be $count(S)$.\n\nSo the total sum is $\\sum_{S=A+B}^{B+C} count(S) \\cdot f(S)$.\nThe maximum value for $S$ is $B+C \\approx 5 \\cdot 10^5 + 5 \\cdot 10^5 = 10^6$.\nThis sum can be computed in $O(B+C)$ time, which is efficient enough.\n\nLet's analyze $f(S) = \\max(0, \\min(D, S-1) - C + 1)$:\nThe term $\\min(D, S-1)$ means we need to consider two cases for $S$:\nCase 1: $S-1 \\leq D \\Rightarrow S \\leq D+1$. Then $\\min(D, S-1) = S-1$.\n$f(S) = \\max(0, S-1-C+1) = \\max(0, S-C)$.\nThis applies for $S \\leq D+1$.\nCase 2: $S-1 > D \\Rightarrow S > D+1$. Then $\\min(D, S-1) = D$.\n$f(S) = \\max(0, D-C+1)$.\nThis applies for $S > D+1$.\n\nLet $S_{start} = A+B$ and $S_{end} = B+C$.\nThe total count is $\\sum_{S=S_{start}}^{S_{end}} count(S) \\cdot f(S)$.\n\nLet's break down the sum based on $S$ relative to $C$ and $D+1$.\nThe term $f(S)$ is $S-C$ when $S \\leq D+1$ and $S-C > 0$. It is $D-C+1$ when $S > D+1$ and $D-C+1 > 0$. It is $0$ otherwise.\nMore precisely, $f(S)$ is the number of integers $z$ such that $C \\le z \\le \\min(D, S-1)$.\nThis range for $z$ is non-empty if $C \\le \\min(D, S-1)$.\nThis means $C \\le D$ (which is true by problem statement) and $C \\le S-1 \\Rightarrow S \\ge C+1$.\nSo $f(S)=0$ for $S \\le C$.\n\nFor $S \\in [C+1, D+1]$: $f(S) = S-C$.\nFor $S \\in [D+2, S_{end}]$: $f(S) = D-C+1$.\n(Note that $D-C+1$ could be 0 or negative if $D < C$, but problem states $C \\le D$, so $D-C+1 \\ge 1$. If $D-C+1=0$ means $D=C-1$, but $C \\le D$ makes $D-C+1 \\ge 1$.)\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1. Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n2. Iterate $S$ from $A+B$ to $B+C$.\n3. For each $S$:\n    a. Calculate $x_{min} = \\max(A, S-C)$.\n    b. Calculate $x_{max} = \\min(B, S-B)$.\n    c. Calculate $count(S) = \\max(0, x_{max} - x_{min} + 1)$.\n    d. If $count(S) > 0$:\n        i. If $S \\leq C$: $f(S)=0$. (No $z$ can satisfy $C \\leq z$ and $z < S$ if $S \\leq C$)\n        ii. If $C < S \\leq D+1$: $f(S) = S-C$.\n        iii. If $S > D+1$: $f(S) = D-C+1$.\n        (Note: $D-C+1$ is guaranteed to be $\\ge 1$ because $C \\le D$.)\n        iv. Add $count(S) \\cdot f(S)$ to `total_triangles`.\n4. Print `total_triangles`.\n\nExample walkthrough: $A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4$.\n$S_{start} = A+B = 1+2=3$.\n$S_{end} = B+C = 2+3=5$.\n\nIterate $S$ from $3$ to $5$:\n\n$S=3$:\n$x_{min} = \\max(A, S-C) = \\max(1, 3-3) = \\max(1,0) = 1$.\n$x_{max} = \\min(B, S-B) = \\min(2, 3-2) = \\min(2,1) = 1$.\n$count(3) = x_{max} - x_{min} + 1 = 1-1+1 = 1$. (Pair: $(x,y)=(1,2)$)\nSince $S=3 \\leq C=3$, $f(3)=0$.\nContribution: $1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\n$S=4$:\n$x_{min} = \\max(A, S-C) = \\max(1, 4-3) = \\max(1,1) = 1$.\n$x_{max} = \\min(B, S-B) = \\min(2, 4-2) = \\min(2,2) = 2$.\n$count(4) = x_{max} - x_{min} + 1 = 2-1+1 = 2$. (Pairs: $(x,y)=(1,3), (2,2)$)\nSince $C < S \\leq D+1$ ($3 < 4 \\leq 5$), $f(4) = S-C = 4-3=1$.\nContribution: $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n\n$S=5$:\n$x_{min} = \\max(A, S-C) = \\max(1, 5-3) = \\max(1,2) = 2$.\n$x_{max} = \\min(B, S-B) = \\min(2, 5-2) = \\min(2,3) = 2$.\n$count(5) = x_{max} - x_{min} + 1 = 2-2+1 = 1$. (Pair: $(x,y)=(2,3)$)\nSince $C < S \\leq D+1$ ($3 < 5 \\leq 5$), $f(5) = S-C = 5-3=2$.\nContribution: $1 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n\nTotal triangles = $0 + 2 + 2 = 4$. This matches the example output.\n\nThis approach is correct and efficient. The loop runs $B+C - (A+B) + 1 = C-A+1$ times. Maximum value of $C-A+1$ is $5 \\cdot 10^5 - 1 + 1 = 5 \\cdot 10^5$.
