Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Morse Code Sequence Count Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down. The core is about counting sequences of English letters that translate to substrings within a growing binary string, `S`.  It's a dynamic problem, where `S` gets extended character by character, and I need the count *after* each extension, modulo a large prime.  Sounds like a fun challenge.\n\nLet's break this down further.  I've got the Morse code representation in my head – dots as '0', dashes as '1'.  Each letter maps to a Morse string of length 1 to 4, and there are those pesky four invalid strings that don't correspond to any letter. So, any other combination of 1-4 bits will be a valid letter.\n\nThe input `S` is the evolving string. It starts empty and then grows with each append of '0' or '1'.  I've got a limit of 3000 appends, so that sets an upper bound on the string's final length.\n\nThe real meat of the problem is finding the number of *non-empty* sequences that map to a *substring* of `S`.  I want to make sure I grasp the \"substring\" part.  It means the sequence of Morse codes needs to perfectly match a chunk of the current `S`, not just be a prefix.\n\nInitially, I thought about using dynamic programming where `dp[i]` would store the number of valid sequences for the prefix of length `i`. But, since the problem is about substrings, I'll have to consider all possible substrings for each string length.\n\nSo, I need to come up with a clever way to compute the count of such sequences. Let me think. For each substring `S[i..j]`, I'll need a function `f(text)` that finds the number of ways a string `text` can be decomposed into valid morse codes.  `f(text)` could be computed recursively or using DP. This is looking promising, but I am still concerned about the runtime complexity.\n\nIf I use `f` for all substrings of `S`, I might end up with `O(N^2)` substrings.  Applying `f` to each of them might take `O(length_of_substring * 4)`.  That will likely be too slow for the constraint.\n\nI need to optimize the substring decomposition. Perhaps I can maintain an \"active window\" or use some kind of prefix sum idea to avoid recalculating everything from scratch at each step.  Thinking... need to keep the modular arithmetic in mind too. Let's see...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by concatenating Morse code representations, where the combined Morse code string is a substring of a given string `S`. The string `S` grows by appending '0' or '1' characters one at a time. We need to report the count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each append operation.\n\nLet `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n\nFirst, let's identify the valid Morse code strings. A Morse code string for an English letter must have length 1, 2, 3, or 4. There are $2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30$ such strings. Four of these are explicitly stated as invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". Therefore, there are $30 - 4 = 26$ valid Morse code strings, each corresponding to a unique English letter.\n\nLet `is_valid[code_string]` be a boolean indicating if `code_string` is a valid Morse code for an English letter. We can precompute this:\n`is_valid` is true for all strings of length 1 to 4 except \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\nLet `S` be the current string after some appends. Suppose its length is `N`.\nWe are interested in the number of non-empty sequences of English letters whose concatenated Morse code representation is *some substring* `S[i...j]` of `S`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of ways the suffix `S[k...N-1]` can be parsed into a sequence of valid Morse code letters.\n`dp[N] = 1` (representing an empty sequence, which is a base case for recursion but we only care about non-empty sequences).\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n`dp[k] = sum(dp[k + length])` for all valid Morse code `S[k...k+length-1]` where `length` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and `k + length <= N`.\nIf `S[k...k+length-1]` is a valid Morse code string, it means we can form a sequence starting with the letter corresponding to `S[k...k+length-1]`, followed by any sequence represented by `S[k+length...N-1]`.\nThe total number of non-empty sequences represented by `S[k...N-1]` is `(dp[k] - dp[N]) % MOD`. Since `dp[N]=1`, this is `(dp[k] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`.\n\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, `S` becomes `S + c`. Let the new length be `N`.\nWe need to calculate the sum of `(dp_substring[i...j] - 1 + MOD) % MOD` for all `0 <= i <= j < N`.\nThis approach of calculating `dp` for each substring is too slow.\n\nLet's use a dynamic programming approach that updates efficiently.\nLet `S` be `s_0 s_1 ... s_{N-1}`.\nWhen a new character `s_N` is appended, we need to consider all substrings `S[i...N]` for `0 <= i <= N`.\nThe substrings `S[i...j]` where `j < N` have already been accounted for in the previous step. We only need to consider substrings ending at `s_N`, i.e., `S[i...N]` for `0 <= i <= N`.\n\nLet `current_dp[k]` be the number of ways the suffix `S[k...N-1]` can be parsed into a sequence of valid Morse code letters.\nWhen `s_N` is appended, the string becomes `S' = S + s_N`. The new length is `N+1`.\nWe need to compute `current_dp'[k]` for `0 <= k <= N`.\n`current_dp'[N+1] = 1`.\n`current_dp'[N]` (for suffix `s_N`) is calculated by checking `s_N` itself as a Morse code, which is always valid. So `current_dp'[N] = current_dp'[N+1] = 1`.\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n`current_dp'[k] = sum(current_dp'[k + length])` for valid Morse code `S'[k...k+length-1]` of length `length` (1 to 4).\nThis is still `O(N)` for each append, making it `O(M^2)` overall. With `M=3000`, `M^2 = 9 \\times 10^6`, which might be acceptable.\n\nLet `current_dp[k]` be the number of ways the suffix `S[k...N-1]` can be parsed into a sequence of valid Morse code letters.\nWhen `s_N` is appended, `S` becomes `S + s_N`.\nWe need to compute `current_dp[N]` (for `S[N...N]`) which is 1.\n`current_dp[N-1]` (for `S[N-1...N]`) is `current_dp[N]` if `S[N-1]` is valid (always) + `current_dp[N+1]` if `S[N-1...N]` is valid.\nThis is not quite right.\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways the suffix `S[i...N-1]` can be parsed.\nWhen `s_N` is appended, the string is now `S' = S_0...S_N`.\nWe need to calculate `dp_new[i]` for `i=0...N`.\n`dp_new[N+1] = 1`.\n`dp_new[N] = 0`.\nFor `k` from `N` down to `0`:\n  For `len` from 1 to 4:\n    If `k + len <= N+1` and `S'[k...k+len-1]` is a valid Morse code:\n      `dp_new[k] = (dp_new[k] + dp_new[k+len]) % MOD`.\n\nThe total answer after `N+1` characters (0-indexed `S_0...S_N`) is `sum((dp_new[k] - 1 + MOD) % MOD for k from 0 to N)`.\nThis sum can be maintained. Let `total_sum` be the answer.\nWhen `s_N` is appended:\n1. `dp_new[N+1] = 1`.\n2. Compute `dp_new[N]`. This considers `S_N` as a length-1 code. `dp_new[N] = dp_new[N+1] = 1`.\n3. Compute `dp_new[N-1]`. This considers `S_{N-1}` (len 1), `S_{N-1}S_N` (len 2).\n   `dp_new[N-1] = (dp_new[N] + (dp_new[N+1] if S_{N-1}S_N is valid else 0)) % MOD`.\n...\nFor `k` from `N` down to `0`:\n  `dp_new[k] = 0`\n  For `len` from 1 to 4:\n    If `k + len <= N+1` and `S'[k...k+len-1]` is a valid Morse code:\n      `dp_new[k] = (dp_new[k] + dp_new[k+len]) % MOD`.\nThe values `dp_new[k]` for `k < N` are affected by `S_N`.\nSpecifically, `dp_new[k]` depends on `dp_new[k+1]`, `dp_new[k+2]`, `dp_new[k+3]`, `dp_new[k+4]`.\nThe values `dp[k]` from the previous step are not directly usable. We need to recompute `dp[k]` for all `k` from `N` down to `0`.\n\nThe total answer is the sum of `(dp[k] - 1)` for `k` from `0` to `N`.\nLet `ans_at_N` be this sum.\nWhen `s_N` is appended, we compute `dp[N]` (which is 1).\nThen `dp[N-1]`, `dp[N-2]`, `dp[N-3]`, `dp[N-4]`.\nFor `k < N-4`, `dp[k]` depends on `dp[k+1]...dp[k+4]`.\nThe new `dp[k]` values are `dp_new[k]`.\n`dp_new[N+1] = 1`.\n`dp_new[N] = dp_new[N+1] = 1`.\n`dp_new[N-1] = (dp_new[N] + (dp_new[N+1] if S[N-1...N] is valid)) % MOD`.\n`dp_new[N-2] = (dp_new[N-1] + (dp_new[N] if S[N-2...N-1] is valid) + (dp_new[N+1] if S[N-2...N] is valid)) % MOD`.\n...\nThis is exactly the `O(M^2)` approach. Let's verify `M=3000` and `M^2` operations.\nFor each of `M` appends:\n  We iterate `k` from `N` down to `0` (current length `N+1`). This is `O(N)` iterations.\n  Inside, we iterate `len` from 1 to 4. This is `O(1)` iterations.\n  Total `O(N)` per append. Total `O(M^2)`.\n  `3000^2 = 9 \\times 10^6`. Each step involves string slicing and checking validity, and additions.\n  String slicing `S[k...k+len-1]` can be slow if `S` is a Python string. We should use a list of characters or `collections.deque` for `S`.\n  Checking validity can be done with a `set` of invalid strings.\n\nLet `S_list` be the list of characters representing `S`.\n`dp` array stores `dp[k]` values. `dp` has size `N+2`.\n`dp[N+1] = 1`.\nWhen `s_N` is appended:\n  `S_list.append(s_N)`\n  `N = len(S_list)`\n  `dp.append(0)` (size becomes `N+2`)\n  `dp[N] = 1` (since `S[N]` is a valid 1-char code)\n  `current_ans_contribution = (dp[N] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`\n  For `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp[k] = 0`\n    For `length` from 1 to 4:\n      If `k + length <= N`:\n        `sub = \"\".join(S_list[k : k+length])`\n        If `sub` is not in `INVALID_CODES`:\n          `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+length]) % MOD`\n    `current_ans_contribution = (current_ans_contribution + dp[k] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`\n  `total_ans = (total_ans + current_ans_contribution) % MOD`\nThis is incorrect. `total_ans` should be the sum of `dp[k]-1` for `k=0...N`.\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of ways to parse `S[k...N-1]`.\nWhen `S_N` is added:\n  `S_list.append(S_N)`\n  `new_N = len(S_list)`\n  `dp.append(0)` (now `dp` has size `new_N+1`)\n  `dp[new_N] = 1` (base case for empty suffix)\n  `new_sum_dp_minus_1 = 0`\n  For `k` from `new_N-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp[k] = 0`\n    For `length` from 1 to 4:\n      If `k + length <= new_N`:\n        `sub = \"\".join(S_list[k : k+length])`\n        If `sub` not in `INVALID_CODES`:\n          `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+length]) % MOD`\n    `new_sum_dp_minus_1 = (new_sum_dp_minus_1 + dp[k] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`\n  Print `new_sum_dp_minus_1`.\n\nThis `O(M^2)` approach seems plausible. Let's make sure the string slicing and `set` lookup are fast enough.\n`\"\".join(list_slice)` creates a new string. For `length` up to 4, this is fast.\nSet lookup is `O(length)`. Overall `O(N * 4 * 4) = O(N)`.\nTotal time `sum(N_i)` for `N_i` from `1` to `M` is `O(M^2)`.\n`9 \\times 10^6` operations is fine for 1-2 seconds time limit.\n\nLet's trace the first example:\n`M = 3`\n`S` is initially empty. `dp` is `[1]` (for empty string `S[0...-1]`). `total_ans = 0`.\n\n1. Append '1'. `S = \"1\"`. `N = 1`.\n   `dp` becomes `[0, 0, 1]` (size `N+2 = 3`).\n   `dp[1] = 1` (base case for `S[1...]` which is empty).\n   `new_sum_dp_minus_1 = 0`.\n   `k = 0`:\n     `dp[0] = 0`.\n     `length = 1`: `S[0...0] = \"1\"`. Valid. `dp[0] = (dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1) % MOD = 1`.\n     `length = 2,3,4`: `0+len > N` so skip.\n     `new_sum_dp_minus_1 = (new_sum_dp_minus_1 + dp[0] - 1 + MOD) % MOD = (0 + 1 - 1 + MOD) % MOD = 0`.\n   Wait, `total_ans` is the sum of `(dp[k]-1)` for all `k` from `0` to `N-1`.\n   For `S=\"1\"`, `N=1`.\n   `dp` array will be size `N+1 = 2`. `dp[1]=1`.\n   `k=0`: `S[0...0] = \"1\"`. Valid. `dp[0] = dp[1] = 1`.\n   Answer for `S=\"1\"` is `(dp[0]-1+MOD)%MOD = (1-1+MOD)%MOD = 0`. This is wrong.\n   The example output is `1`.\n\nThe problem definition: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\nIf `S = \"1\"`, the only substring is `\"1\"`.\n`\"1\"` corresponds to 'T'.\nThe sequence \"T\" is one non-empty sequence. So the answer should be 1.\n\nThe `dp[k]` definition: \"number of ways the suffix `S[k...N-1]` can be parsed into a sequence of valid Morse code letters\".\nIf `S[k...N-1]` is `\"1\"`, `dp[0]` should be 1 (for \"T\").\nThe number of non-empty sequences represented by `S[k...N-1]` is `dp[k]`.\nThis is if we define `dp[N]=0` for empty string, meaning it can't be parsed into any sequence.\nIf `dp[N]=0`:\n  `dp[k] = sum(dp[k+length] + 1)` for valid `S[k...k+length-1]`.\n  The `+1` is for the case where `S[k...k+length-1]` itself forms a sequence without any following letters.\nThis is a different DP formulation.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways the prefix `S[0...i-1]` can be parsed into a sequence of valid Morse code letters.\n`dp[0] = 1` (empty prefix can be parsed into an empty sequence).\n`dp[i] = sum(dp[i-length])` for valid Morse code `S[i-length...i-1]`.\nThis is for prefixes. We need substrings.\n\nLet's re-read the problem statement carefully: \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\".\n\nConsider `S = \"1\"`. Substring is `\"1\"`. `\"1\"` is 'T'. Sequence \"T\". Count = 1.\nConsider `S = \"11\"`. Substrings: `\"1\"`, `\"11\"`.\n  `\"1\"` -> 'T'. Sequence \"T\".\n  `\"11\"` -> 'M'. Sequence \"M\".\n  `\"11\"` can also be 'T' + 'T'. Sequence \"TT\".\nTotal: \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\". Count = 3.\n\nConsider `S = \"111\"`. Substrings: `\"1\"`, `\"11\"`, `\"111\"`.\n  `\"1\"` -> 'T'.

(Sequences: T.I, T.E.T, N.T, N.E.T)\nMy `dp` definition counts the number of ways to parse, which is not the same as unique sequences if multiple parsings result in the same sequence.\nExample: `S=\"11\"`.\n`S[0...0]=\"1\"`. Parses: \"T\".\n`S[1...1]=\"1\"`. Parses: \"T\".\n`S[0...1]=\"11\"`. Parses: \"M\", \"TT\".\nThe set of unique sequences is {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"}. Size 3.\n\nThis means we need to use a data structure to store the set of sequences found so far, and add new ones.\nA `set` of strings is too slow for `M=3000`. `M^2` substrings, each substring can generate `2^k` sequences.\nThe length of sequences can be up to `M`.\n`M=3000` means `3000^2` substrings. Each can generate `~1.6^3000` sequences. This is not feasible.\n\nThe problem states: \"each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter\".\nThis is a key property. If `M_1 M_2 ... M_k` is a sequence of Morse codes, and `M'_1 M'_2 ... M'_p` is another sequence of Morse codes, then if `M_1 M_2 ... M_k = M'_1 M'_2 ... M'_p` as strings, then `k=p` and `M_i = M'_i` for all `i`.\nThis is the property of unique decodability. Since each Morse code string maps to a distinct letter, if the Morse code sequence is unique, the letter sequence is unique.\nSo, `M_1 M_2 ... M_k` is a unique Morse code sequence means `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` is a unique letter sequence.\nThe problem is asking for the sum of `count_parses(S[i...j])` but only counting each *distinct* sequence once.\n\nLet's re-read the example explanation:\n`S = \"111\"`.\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\") <-- This is `S[0...1]` parsed as `T T`.\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\") <-- This is `S[0...2]` parsed as `T M`.\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\") <-- This is `S[0...2]` parsed as `M T`.\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") <-- This is `S[0...2]` parsed as `T T T`.\nTotal 7.\n\nThe example says \"All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.\"\nThe list provided above is the set of *unique* sequences.\nFor `S=\"111\"`, `count_parses(\"1\")=1`, `count_parses(\"11\")=2`, `count_parses(\"111\")=4`.\nSubstrings:\n`S[0...0]=\"1\"`. Parses: {\"T\"}.\n`S[1...1]=\"1\"`. Parses: {\"T\"}.\n`S[2...2]=\"1\"`. Parses: {\"T\"}.\n`S[0...1]=\"11\"`. Parses: {\"M\", \"TT\"}.\n`S[1...2]=\"11\"`. Parses: {\"M\", \"TT\"}.\n`S[0...2]=\"111\"`. Parses: {\"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}.\nThe union of these sets is {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}. Its size is 7.\n\nSo the task is to maintain a `set` of all unique sequences encountered.\nThis `set` approach is too slow. The length of sequences can be up to `M`.\nA sequence like \"TT...T\" (`M` times) would be a string of length `M`. Storing `M^2` such strings is too much.\n\nThe problem must have a DP solution that counts this implicitly.\nThe number of distinct sequences is `|bigcup_{0 \\le i \\le j < N} {sequences(S[i...j])}|`.\nThis is a standard problem type solvable with Aho-Corasick or similar string matching, but the \"sequences\" are not fixed patterns.\n\nLet's reconsider the properties of the Morse codes.\nLengths 1-4.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4. This is a small constant.\nThis suggests that a DP related to the last 4 characters might be useful.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed using suffixes of `S[0...i-1]`.\nThis is still hard.\n\nThe problem is asking for `count(unique_sequences)`.\nLet `dp[k]` be the number of unique sequences that can be generated by `S[k...N-1]`.\n`dp[N] = 0`.\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[k] = |union_{length=1 to 4, S[k...k+length-1] valid} {L + seq | L=letter(S[k...k+length-1]), seq is sequence for S[k+length...N-1]}|`.\n  This is effectively `|union_l ( {L} union {L+seq for seq in sequences(S[k+length...N-1])} )|`.\n  This is `sum_l (1 + dp[k+length])` if the `L+seq` are all distinct.\n  But they are not. `S=\"111\"`.\n  `k=0, S[0...2]=\"111\"`.\n  `len=1: S[0]=\"1\" -> 'T'`.

So `dp[2]` from this is {\"T\"}.\n      `dp[2] = 1`.\n    So `dp[1]` from `S[1]=\"1\"`: {\"T\"} union {\"T\" + \"T\"} = {\"T\", \"TT\"}.\n    `len=2: S[1...2]=\"11\" -> 'M'`.

Size 7.\nThis is exactly the example calculation.\n\nSo, `dp[k]` must store the *set* of sequences.\nThis is too slow. `set` operations on strings of length `O(M)` are `O(M)`. `O(M)` `dp` states. `O(M^2)` total. `3000^2 * 3000 = 2.7 * 10^{10}` operations.\n\nThe actual letters are not important, only their distinctness.\nSince each Morse code of length 1-4 maps to a distinct letter, we can simply say that `letter(code_1) + letter(code_2) + ...` is distinct if `code_1 code_2 ...` is distinct.\nThe problem simplifies to counting the number of distinct sequences of *Morse codes* (not letters) that can be formed by parsing substrings of `S`.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be a `set` of `tuples` of integers. Each integer represents a Morse code string.\nExample: '0' -> 0, '1' -> 1, '00' -> 2, '01' -> 3, ..., '1111' -> 29.\n`INVALID_CODES` are mapped to -1 or something.\nSo `dp[k]` would be `set( (code_idx_1, code_idx_2, ...) )`.\nStill too slow. Tuples of integers are hashable, but their length can be `O(M)`.\n\nThe crucial property is that the maximum length of a Morse code is 4.\nThis means that `dp[k]` only depends on `dp[k+1], dp[k+2], dp[k+3], dp[k+4]`.\nWe need to count the size of `union(S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4)` where `S_i` are sets of sequences.\n`|A union B| = |A| + |B| - |A intersect B|`.\n`|A union B union C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - (|A intersect B| + |A intersect C| + |B intersect C|) + |A intersect B intersect C|`.\nFor 4 sets, this is inclusion-exclusion principle for 4 sets.\n`|S_1 U S_2 U S_3 U S_4| = sum_i |S_i| - sum_{i<j} |S_i intersect S_j| + sum_{i<j<k} |S_i intersect S_j intersect S_k| - |S_1 intersect S_2 intersect S_3 intersect S_4|`.\nEach `S_i` would be `{L_i} union {L_i + seq | seq in dp[k+len_i]}`.\n`|S_i| = 1 + dp[k+len_i]`.\nThe intersection terms are the problem. For example, `(L_1 + seq_1) = (L_2 + seq_2)`.\nThis implies `L_1 = L_2` and `seq_1 = seq_2`.\nSince all `L_i` (Morse codes of length 1-4) are distinct, `L_1 = L_2` implies `S[k...k+len_1-1] = S[k...k+len_2-1]`, which implies `len_1=len_2`.\nSo `S_i intersect S_j` is empty if `i != j`.\nThis means `dp[k] = sum_{length=1 to 4, S[k...k+length-1] valid} (1 + dp[k+length]) % MOD`.\nThis is exactly my `dp` definition that gave 5 for `S=\"11\"`.\nThe problem note example states:\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\nThese are all distinct letter sequences. The issue is `S[0...1]` is `\"11\"` and `S[1...2]` is `\"11\"`.\nThe sequence \"TT\" is generated by `S[0...1]`.\nThe sequence \"TT\" is also generated by `S[1...2]`.\nWhen we sum up `dp[k]` for all `k`, we are double-counting.\n`total_ans = sum_{k=0}^{N-1} dp[k]`.\nFor `S=\"11\"`, `dp[0]=3` (for `S[0...1]`) and `dp[1]=1` (for `S[1...1]`).\nSum is 4. Example is 3.\nThe sequence \"T\" from `S[0...0]` and \"T\" from `S[1...1]` are the same sequence.\nSo we need to count each unique sequence only once, regardless of which substring generated it.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing `S[i...N-1]`.\nLet `total_dp[i]` be the sum of `dp[j]` for `j >= i`.\nThis is equivalent to: `total_dp[i] = dp[i] + total_dp[i+1]`.\nThe total answer for `S` is `total_dp[0]`.\n\nThis structure is a known problem related to counting distinct paths in a DAG.\nThe states are `(start_index, last_4_chars_of_sequence_so_far)`.\nThe sequence itself can be arbitrarily long.\nWe need to count distinct sequences.\nThis typically involves using Aho-Corasick automaton or suffix structures, but here the \"patterns\" are not fixed.\n\nSince `M` is small (3000), `O(M^2)` is fine.\nThe challenge is how to count distinct sequences in `O(M^2)`.\nThis implies that the \"distinctness\" must be implicitly handled by the DP state.\nThe length of the Morse code for a letter is at most 4.\nThis means that a sequence `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` is uniquely determined by `M_1 M_2 ... M_k`.\nIf two different substrings `S[i...j]` and `S[p...q]` generate the same sequence of letters, e.g., \"TT\", then we only count \"TT\" once.\n\nThe total answer is `|UNION_{0 <= i <= j < N} Set_of_sequences(S[i...j])|`.\nThis is the same as `|UNION_{0 <= i < N} Set_of_sequences_starting_at_i(S[i...N-1])|`.\nLet `Sets[i]` be `Set_of_sequences_starting_at_i(S[i...N-1])`.\nWe need `|UNION_{i=0}^{N-1} Sets[i]|`.\nBy inclusion-exclusion, this is `sum |Sets[i]| - sum |Sets[i] intersect Sets[j]| + ...`.\nThis is too complex.\n\nConsider the example `S = \"11\"`.\n`Sets[0]` for `S[0...1]=\"11\"`: {\"M\", \"TT\"}. Size 2.\n`Sets[1]` for `S[1...1]=\"1\" `: {\"T\"}. Size 1.\n`|Sets[0] U Sets[1]| = |Sets[0]| + |Sets[1]| - |Sets[0] intersect Sets[1]|`.\n`Sets[0] intersect Sets[1]` is empty.\nSo `2 + 1 - 0 = 3`. This matches the example!\n\nConsider `S = \"111\"`. `N=3`.\n`Sets[0]` for `S[0...2]=\"111\"`: {\"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}. Size 4.\n`Sets[1]` for `S[1...2]=\"11\"`: {\"M\", \"TT\"}. Size 2.\n`Sets[2]` for `S[2...2]=\"1\"`: {\"T\"}. Size 1.\n`|Sets[0] U Sets[1] U Sets[2]|`.\n`Sets[0] intersect Sets[1]` is empty.\n`Sets[0] intersect Sets[2]` is empty.\n`Sets[1] intersect Sets[2]` is empty.\nSo `|Sets[0]| + |Sets[1]| + |Sets[2]| = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7`. This matches the example!\n\nThis means that for distinct `i` and `j`, `Sets[i]` and `Sets[j]` are always disjoint.\nWhy would this be true?\nIf `seq` is in `Sets[i]` and `Sets[j]` for `i < j`.\nThen `seq` is formed by `S[i...i+L-1]` and by `S[j...j+L'-1]`.\nThis means `S[i...i+L-1] = S[j...j+L'-1]` as Morse code strings.\nThis means `seq` is a letter sequence that can be formed from `S[i...]` and `S[j...]`.\nThe first letter of `seq` would be `L_1`.\n`L_1` comes from `S[i...i+len_1-1]` and from `S[j...j+len'_1-1]`.\nSince `i < j`, these are different starting positions.\nExample: `S=\"11\"`. `Sets[0]` has \"M\", \"TT\". `Sets[1]` has \"T\".\n\"T\" from `Sets[0]` would mean `S[0...0]` is \"T\". This is not a sequence from `S[0...1]` that would be counted in `Sets[0]`.\n`Sets[i]` is defined as `Set_of_sequences_starting_at_i(S[i...N-1])`.\nSo `Sets[0]` for `S=\"11\"` means sequences starting with `S[0]`.\n`S[0]=\"1\"`. So \"T\" is a possible first letter.\n`S[0...0]=\"1\"` -> \"T\". Remaining `S[1...1]=\"1\"`. `Sets[1]` is {\"T\"}. So \"T\" is from `S[0]` followed by nothing, or \"T\" followed by \"T\" (from `S[1]`).\nThe definition of `dp[k]` needs to be:\n`dp[k]` is the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by parsing `S[k...N-1]`.\n`dp[N] = 0`.\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp[k] = 0`.\n  `temp_set = set()`.\n  For `length` from 1 to 4:\n    If `k + length <= N`:\n      `sub = \"\".join(S_list[k : k+length])`\n      If `sub` not in `INVALID_CODES`:\n        `L = letter_map[sub]`. (map \"0\"->'A', \"1\"->'B', etc. for distinctness)\n        `temp_set.add(L)`.\n        For `seq` in `dp[k+length]`:\n          `temp_set.add(L + seq)`.\n  `dp[k] = len(temp_set)`.\nThis is the one that uses `set` of strings, which is too slow.\n\nThe only way this works is if `L_1 + seq_1 = L_2 + seq_2` implies `L_1 = L_2` and `seq_1 = seq_2`.\nAnd `L_1 = L_2` implies `len_1 = len_2`.\nThis means the `sum(1 + dp[k+length])` formula is correct.\nThe sum of `dp[k]` for `k=0...N-1` is the total count.\n`sum_{k=0}^{N-1} dp[k]` means `sum_{k=0}^{N-1} f(S[k...N-1])`.\nFor `S=\"1\"`, `f(\"1\")=1`. `sum=1`. Correct.\nFor `S=\"11\"`, `f(\"11\")=3`, `f(\"1\")=1`. Sum is `3+1=4`. Example output is 3.\n\nThis means my interpretation of the example is flawed, or the problem is much harder.\nThe example states \"All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.\"\nThe list it provides for `S=\"111\"` is `{\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}`.

Size 7.\nThis is what the example output means.\n\nThis is a very common trick in competitive programming problems with small alphabet size and small max length:\nUse polynomial hashing to represent sequences.\nEach letter `L` can be mapped to a unique integer `h(L)`.\nA sequence `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` can be hashed as `(h(L_1) * P^(k-1) + h(L_2) * P^(k-2) + ... + h(L_k) * P^0) % MOD_H`.\nWe need to maintain a `set` of these hashes.\n`P` is a large prime, `MOD_H` is another large prime. Use two hash functions to reduce collisions.\n\nEach time a new character `s_N` is appended to `S`:\n  `S_list.append(s_N)`. `N = len(S_list)`.\n  We need to compute all sequences that *end* at `S_N`.\n  For each `i` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    We need to compute all sequences `L_1 ...

For each substring `S[i...N-1]`, we compute `dp_hashes` for suffixes `S[j...N-1]`.\nThis is `O(N-i)` states. Each state `dp_hashes[j]` can contain `O(N-j)` hashes.\nThe number of sequences for `S[j...N-1]` can be exponential. E.g., `S=\"00000000\"`.\n`f(\"0000\") = 8`. `f(\"00000\") = f(\"0\") + f(\"00\") + f(\"000\") + f(\"0000\")`.\n`f(\"0\")=1, f(\"00\")=2, f(\"000\")=4, f(\"0000\")=8`.\n`f(\"00000\") = 1+2+4+8 = 15`.\n`f(\"000000\") = 15+8+4+2 = 29`.\nThe number of sequences grows roughly as `1.6^N`.\n`M=3000`, `1.6^3000` is huge. Storing these sets is not possible.\n\nThe constraint `M <= 3000` strongly suggests an `O(M^2)` solution.\nThe `O(M^2)` solution requires `O(1)` per DP state or `O(log M)` or `O(alpha(M))`.\nThe total number of sequences can be large, but the *answer* (total count) fits in `long long` and is modulo `10^9+7`.\n\nThis is a classic problem structure for Aho-Corasick or string matching on a trie.\nThe problem is that the \"patterns\" are not fixed.\nThe letters are \"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", ..., \"1111\" (excluding 4 invalid ones). There are 26 such patterns.\nWe can build a trie of these 26 Morse code patterns.\nEach node in the trie represents a prefix of a Morse code.\nWhen we are at `S[k]`, we can traverse the trie using `S[k], S[k+1], ...`.\nThis is often used for counting number of occurrences of patterns. But here we need sequences.\n\nLet's rethink `dp[k]` from the example.\n`S=\"1\"` -> 1\n`S=\"11\"` -> 3\n`S=\"111\"` -> 7\nThis looks like `2^N - 1` for `S=\"1...1\"` if `N` is length.\n`2^1-1=1`, `2^2-1=3`, `2^3-1=7`.\nWhat if `S=\"0\"`?

Its size is `O(M^2)` in the worst case (`fib(N)`). No, `O(N)` for a single `h_dp[k]`.\n`h_dp[k]` can be `O(N)`. `h_dp[k+length]` can be `O(N)`.\n`O(N)` elements, each `set.add` takes `O(1)` average.\nSo `O(N)` per `dp[k]` calculation.\nTotal `O(N^2)` per append. `O(M^3)` total. `3000^3 = 2.7 * 10^{10}`. Too slow.\n\nThe size of `h_dp[k]` is at most `O(N-k)`.\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `h_dp[k]` calculation: `O(1)` calls to `h_dp[k+len]`. Each call iterates `O(N-k-len)` elements.\n  Total for `h_dp[k]` is `O(N-k)`.\nTotal for one append is `sum_{k=0}^{N-1} O(N-k) = O(N^2)`.\nTotal for `M` appends is `sum_{N=1}^{M} O(N^2) = O(M^3)`.\n\nThis `O(M^3)` solution is for `M=300`. For `M=3000`, this is too slow.\nThe `h_dp` sets must be small.\nThe number of distinct sequences starting from `S[k]` can only be `O(1)` or `O(log N)`.\nIf the number of distinct sequences for `S[k...N-1]` is small, then `O(M^3)` might pass.\nWhat is the max size of `h_dp[k]`?\n`S=\"0000\"`:\n`h_dp[3]` for \"0\": {\"A\"}. Size 1.\n`h_dp[2]` for \"00\": {\"A\", \"AA\", \"B\"}. Size 3.\n`h_dp[1]` for \"000\": {\"A\", \"AA\", \"AAA\", \"B\", \"AB\", \"BA\", \"C\"}.

This grows exponentially.\n\nThis is a hard problem. The only way `O(M^2)` works is if the set sizes are small, or if there's a trick to unioning and updating hashes.\nThe total number of sequences is `M(M+1)/2`.\nThe total number of hash values in `total_unique_hashes` is `O(M^2)`.\nEach `update` operation on `total_unique_hashes` takes `O(size of h_dp[k])`.\nIf `size of h_dp[k]` is `O(M)`, then `O(M^2)` per append is `O(M^3)`.\n\nMaybe the number of elements in `h_dp[k]` that are *distinct* from `h_dp[k+len]` is small?\nThe problem needs a trick.\nThe problem is about counting distinct strings.\nThis is typically solved with Suffix Automaton or Suffix Tree.\nBut here, the strings are formed by parsing, not simply substrings.\n\nThe only way `O(M^2)` works is if `h_dp[k]` is `O(1)` or `O(log M)`.\nIt's possible that for Morse code, the number of distinct sequences starting at a given position is small.\nThe alphabet size is 26.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4.\nThis means that a sequence `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` is uniquely determined by `M_1 M_2 ... M_k`.\nIf `M_1 M_2 ... M_k = M'_1 M'_2 ... M'_p`, then `k=p` and `M_i = M'_i`.\nThis is prefix code property. Morse code is not a prefix code.\n'E'='0', 'T'='1'. 'I'='00', 'A'='01'. 'N'='10', 'M'='11'.\n'0' is 'E'. '00' is 'I'. '000' is 'S'.\n`S=\"00\"`. `f(\"00\")` gives {\"I\", \"EE\"}.\n`h_dp[1]` for \"0\": {hash('E')}. Size 1.\n`h_dp[0]` for \"00\":\n  `len=1`: `S[0]=\"0\" -> 'E'`. `h_dp[0].add(hash('E'))`.\n    For `seq` in `h_dp[1]` (`hash('E')`): `h_dp[0].add(hash('EE'))`.\n  `len=2`: `S[0...1]=\"00\" -> 'I'`. `h_dp[0].add(hash('I'))`.\n`h_dp[0] = {hash('E'), hash('EE'), hash('I')}`. Size 3.\nThis matches the `2^(N+1)-1` pattern for `S=\"0...0\"`.\nSo `h_dp[k]` can be `O(2^4)=O(16)` at most.\nThis is because `N-k` is at most 4.\nIf `N-k` is greater than 4, say `N-k=5`.\n`h_dp[k]` for `S[k...k+4]`.\n`h_dp[k] = union ( {L_1} U {L_1 + seq | seq in h_dp[k+len_1]} )`.\n`L_1` is for `S[k...k+len_1-1]`. `len_1` is 1 to 4.\nThe longest sequence starts with `S[k]` and continues.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4. This means `S[k...k+length-1]` is limited to `length=4`.\nSo `h_dp[k]` depends on `h_dp[k+1]`, `h_dp[k+2]`, `h_dp[k+3]`, `h_dp[k+4]`.\nThe values of `h_dp[k+length]` are for suffixes `S[k+length...N-1]`.\nThese suffixes can be long.\nThe `O(M^3)` complexity is correct.\nThis problem is likely designed for a language like C++ where `std::set` operations are faster due to better constant factors. Or Python's `set` is efficient enough.\nA `set` of `(int, int)` tuples (for double hashing) is fast.\n`M=3000`. `M^3 = 2.7 * 10^10`. This is too slow.\n`M=3000`. `M^2 = 9 * 10^6`. This is likely the target.\nSo the `h_dp[k]` sets must be small.\n\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4.\nA sequence of letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` corresponds to a string `M_1 M_2 ... M_k`.\nThe number of distinct sequences starting from `S[k]` is `dp[k]`.\n`dp[k]` can be computed by storing the last 4 characters of the sequence.\nFor example, `(L_k, L_{k-1}, L_{k-2}, L_{k-3})`.\nThis is a standard technique for distinct paths problems.\nLet `dp[i][mask]` be the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed using `S[i...N-1]`, where `mask` represents the last few letters of the sequence.\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nLet's check the constraints again. `M <= 3000`.\n`M^2` is `9 * 10^6`. `M^2 * 4` (for length 4) is `3.6 * 10^7`.\nIf the `set` operations are `O(1)` (amortized), then `O(M^2)` should pass.\nThe `current_suffix_hashes` set is constructed for each `k`. Its size is `O(1)` as it only depends on `length` (max 4) and `h_dp[k+length]` (which is small).\nThe `h_dp[k+length]` set itself is what can be large.\n\nThe sum `sum_{i=0}^{N-1} O(N-i)` for `N` elements in `h_dp[i]` is `O(N^2)`.\nThis is the `O(M^3)` part.\nIf `h_dp[k]` is kept small (e.g., max 26 elements), then it's `O(M^2)`.\nWhy would `h_dp[k]` be small?\nLet's analyze the maximum size of `h_dp[k]`.\n`h_dp[k]` contains sequences `L + seq'`, where `L` is a letter for `S[k...k+len-1]`, and `seq'` is a sequence from `S[k+len...N-1]`.\nMax `len` is 4. So `L` can be one of 4 letters.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences starting at a position `k` is `2^4 - 1 = 15` for `0000`.\nThis means `h_dp[k]` can have size at most 15.\nSo `h_dp[k]` is always `O(1)`.\nThis is the key! The number of distinct sequences starting at any position is bounded by a small constant.\nWhy? Because the maximum length of a Morse code is 4.\nLet's consider `S[k...k+max_len-1]`. `max_len = 4`.\nAny sequence starting at `S[k]` must start with one of `S[k]`, `S[k...k+1]`, `S[k...k+2]`, `S[k...k+3]`.\nLet `L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4` be the letters for these four prefixes.\n`h_dp[k]` = `union( {L_1} U {L_1+seq | seq in h_dp[k+1]}, {L_2} U {L_2+seq | seq in h_dp[k+2]}, ... )`.\nIf `h_dp[k+1]` has size `C`, then `L_1+seq` contributes `C` elements.\nTotal size of `h_dp[k]` is `sum (1 + size(h_dp[k+len]))`. This is not a union.\nIt is a union. `|A union B| = |A| + |B| - |A intersect B|`.\nThe maximum size of `h_dp[k]` is indeed small.\nThe example `S=\"0000\"` gave size 15 for `h_dp[0]`.\nThis is `2^4-1` for string of length 4.\nFor `S=\"00000\"`, `h_dp[0]` for \"00000\":\n`len=1: S[0]=\"0\" -> 'A'`. `h_dp[0].add(hash('A'))`.\n  For `seq` in `h_dp[1]` (`h_dp[0]` for \"0000\", size 15): `h_dp[0].add(hash('A'+seq))`.\n  This adds `1+15=16` elements (including 'A').\n`len=2: S[0...1]=\"00\" -> 'I'`. `h_dp[0].add(hash('I'))`.\n  For `seq` in `h_dp[2]` (`h_dp[0]` for \"000\", size 7): `h_dp[0].add(hash('I'+seq))`.\n  This adds `1+7=8` elements.\n`len=3: S[0...2]=\"000\" -> 'S'`. `h_dp[0].add(hash('S'))`.\n  For `seq` in `h_dp[3]` (`h_dp[0]` for \"00\", size 3): `h_dp[0].add(hash('S'+seq))`.\n  This adds `1+3=4` elements.\n`len=4: S[0...3]=\"0000\" -> 'H'`. `h_dp[0].add(hash('H'))`.\n  For `seq` in `h_dp[4]` (`h_dp[0]` for \"0\", size 1): `h_dp[0].add(hash('H'+seq))`.\n  This adds `1+1=2` elements.\nThe total number of elements in `h_dp[0]` is the union of these sets.\n`16 U 8 U 4 U 2`.\nThe elements are `A`, `AA`, `AAA`, `AAAA`, `AAAAA`, `I`, `IA`, `IAA`, `IAAA`, `S`, `SA`, `SAA`, `H`, `HA`.\nThis is `2^5-1=31` elements.\nThe maximum size of `h_dp[k]` is `2^4+2^3+2^2+2^1=30` (strings of length 1 to 4).\nNo, it's `2^4-1` for `0000`. `2^5-1` for `00000`.\nIt is `2^max_morse_len - 1` for a string of `max_morse_len` identical characters.\nSo `h_dp[k]` can be size `2^4-1 = 15` if `N-k = 4`.\nIf `N-k` is greater than 4, say `N-k=5`, the `h_dp[k]` can be `2^5-1 = 31`.\nThe maximum length of `S[k...N-1]` is `M`. `h_dp[k]` can be `2^M - 1`.\nThis is the problem. `h_dp[k]` is exponential in `N-k`.\n\nThe constraint is that Morse code length is at most 4.\nThis means for any sequence `L_1 L_2 ... L_k`, `k` can be at most `N`.\nThe length of `M_i` is at least 1. So `k <= N`.\nThe maximum length of `M_i` is 4. So `k >= N/4`.\nThe number of distinct sequences for `S[k...N-1]` is indeed bounded by `2^4 - 1 = 15` if `N-k <= 4`.\nBut if `N-k` is large, say `N-k=100`, then `h_dp[k]` can contain `fib(100)` elements.\n\nThis is a `O(M^2)` problem. The `h_dp[k]` sets must be small.\nThe only way `h_dp[k]` is small is if the problem is not about counting *all* distinct sequences, but only distinct sequences of length at most `C` (where `C` is small).\nBut the problem does not state such a restriction.\n\nCould it be that the total number of distinct sequences starting at *any* position `k` is bounded by a constant?\nThis would happen if all sequences longer than some `C` are identical to some shorter sequence, or if they are just not generated.\nThis is not true for Morse code.\n\nThe solution must be `O(M^2)` and use hashing.\nThe `h_dp[k]` must be `O(1)`.\nThe number of distinct sequences starting at a given position is limited.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences for any substring `S[i...j]` is `2^4-1=15`?\nNo, `2^k-1` for `k` identical chars.\nConsider `S = \"00000000\"`.\n`h_dp[0]` for `S[0...7]`. This is `2^8-1 = 255`.\nThis is not `O(1)`.\n\nThe crucial detail: \"each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter\".\nThis implies that if `M_1 M_2 ... M_k` and `M'_1 M'_2 ... M'_p` are two distinct sequences of Morse codes, then they represent distinct sequences of English letters.\nSo we are counting distinct Morse code sequences.\n\nThis is a classic problem: counting distinct paths in a DAG.\nThe DAG nodes are `(index, trie_node_id)`.\nThe problem states \"competitive programming\". `O(M^2)` is usually the target for `M=3000`.\nThe `h_dp[k]` sets must be `O(1)`.\nThe number of distinct letter sequences that can start with `S[k]` and have length `L` (number of letters) is `O(1)`.\nThis is wrong.\n\nFinal attempt at logic:\nThe problem is to count `|Union_{i=0}^{N-1} Set_of_sequences(S[i...N-1])|`.\nLet `dp[i]` be the set of hashes of sequences starting at `S[i]`.\nWhen `S_N` is appended:\n  `S_list.append(S_N)`\n  `N_new = len(S_list)`\n  `h_dp.append(set())` (for `h_dp[N_new]`, empty set)\n  `current_set_of_hashes_from_new_suffix = set()`\n  For `k` from `N_new-1` down to `0`:\n    `h_dp[k] = set()`.\n    For `length` from 1 to 4:\n      If `k + length <= N_new`:\n        `sub = \"\".join(S_list[k : k+length])`\n        If `sub` not in `INVALID_CODES`:\n          `L_hash1, L_hash2 = letter_hash[sub]`.\n          `h_dp[k].add((L_hash1, L_hash2))`.\n          For `(seq_h1, seq_h2)` in `h_dp[k+length]`:\n            `h_dp[k].add(((L_hash1 * P1 + seq_h1) % MOD1, (L_hash2 * P2 + seq_h2) % MOD2))`.\n    `current_set_of_hashes_from_new_suffix.update(h_dp[k])`.\n  `total_unique_hashes.update(current_set_of_hashes_from_new_suffix)`.\n  Print `len(total_unique_hashes)`.\n\nThis is `O(M^2 * max_set_size)`.\nIf `max_set_size` is `O(M)`, then `O(M^3)`.\nIf `max_set_size` is `O(1)`, then `O(M^2)`.\nThe maximum size of `h_dp[k]` for `S[k...N-1]` is related to `fib(N-k)`.\n`fib(15)` is 610. `fib(20)` is 6765.\nIf `M=3000`, `N-k` can be up to 3000. `fib(3000)` is huge.\nThis means `h_dp[k]` cannot be stored as `set` of hashes.\n\nThe example outputs `1, 3, 7` for `S=\"1\", \"11\", \"111\"`.\nThis is `2^N - 1`.\n`S=\"10\"`: `1, 3`. My `h_dp` logic: `h_dp[0]` for \"10\" is `{hash('T'), hash('E'), hash('N')}`. Size 3.\n`h_dp[1]` for \"0\" is `{hash('E')}`. Size 1.\nUnion is `{hash('T'), hash('E'), hash('N')}`. Size 3.\nSo for `S=\"10\"`, total is 3.\n`S=\"101\"`: `1, 3, 7`.\n`h_dp[0]` for \"101\":\n  `len=1: S[0]=\"1\" -> 'T'`. `h_dp[0].add(hash('T'))`.\n    For `seq` in `h_dp[1]` (for \"01\"): `h_dp[1]` for \"01\" is `{hash('E'), hash('I')}`.\n    `h_dp[0].add(hash('TE'), hash('TI'))`.\n  `len=2: S[0...1]=\"10\" -> 'N'`. `h_dp[0].add(hash('N'))`.\n    For `seq` in `h_dp[2]` (for \"1\"): `h_dp[2]` for \"1\" is `{hash('T')}`.\n    `h_dp[0].add(hash('NT'))`.\n`h_dp[0]` for \"101\" is `{hash('T'), hash('TE'), hash('TI'), hash('N'), hash('NT')}`. Size 5.\n`h_dp[1]` for \"01\" is `{hash('E'), hash('I')}`. Size 2.\n`h_dp[2]` for \"1\" is `{hash('T')}`. Size 1.\nUnion is `{hash('T'), hash('TE'), hash('TI'), hash('N'), hash('NT'), hash('E'), hash('I')}`. Size 7.\nThis matches the example outputs!\n\nSo the logic is:\n1. Maintain `h_dp[k]` as the set of hashes of all distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by parsing `S[k...N-1]`.\n2. When a new character `s_N` is appended, `S` becomes `S_0...S_N`.\n3. For `k` from `N` down to `0`:\n    a. Calculate `h_dp[k]` based on `h_dp[k+1], h_dp[k+2], h_dp[k+3], h_dp[k+4]`.\n    b. `h_dp[k]` is the union of `{L} U {L+seq}` for valid `L` from `S[k...]` and `seq` from `h_dp[k+len]`.\n4. The answer for `S_0...S_N` is `|Union_{k=0}^{N} h_dp[k]|`.\n\nThe sizes of `h_dp[k]` are still exponential.\nThe maximum possible number of distinct sequences that can start at any position `k` is small.\nThis must be the trick: the constant `4` for max Morse code length.\nLet `dp[k]` be the set of sequences for `S[k...N-1]`.\nThe values `dp[k]` only depend on `dp[k+1], dp[k+2], dp[k+3], dp[k+4]`.\nThe number of distinct sequences starting from `S[k]` is bounded by `C` (a small constant).\nThis is a known property for `k`-bounded parsing.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences for `S[k...N-1]` is bounded by a constant related to `2^max_len`.\nFor max length 4, it's `~2^4 = 16`.\nThe number of distinct sequences starting at `S[k]` is limited to `2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 = 30` (maximum number of valid codes).\nThis is because any sequence starting at `S[k]` must start with one of the 26 letters.\nAnd if it starts with `L`, it's `L` or `L + seq`.\nThe actual maximum size for `h_dp[k]` is `2^max_len - 1` if all prefixes are valid and identical.\nFor `max_len=4`, this is `2^4-1=15`.\nSo `h_dp[k]` will have at most 15 elements.\nThis means `max_set_size = 15`.\nThen `O(M^2 * max_set_size)` is `3000^2 * 15 = 1.35 * 10^8`. This might pass.\n\nLet's confirm the max size of `h_dp[k]`:\n`h_dp[k]` is the set of sequences for `S[k...N-1]`.\nA sequence starts with `L_1` (from `S[k...k+len_1-1]`).\nThen `L_2` (from `S[k+len_1...k+len_1+len_2-1]`).\nThe set of possible `L_1` is at most 4 (from `S[k]`, `S[k...k+1]`, `S[k...k+2]`, `S[k...k+3]`).\nEach `L_1` can be followed by any sequence from `h_dp[k+len_1]`.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences starting at a given position is indeed bounded by a constant.\nThis is because if `S[k...j]` is very long, say 100 characters.\n`h_dp[k]` would be `union (L_1 U {L_1+seq | seq in h_dp[k+len_1]})`.\nConsider a sequence `L_1 L_2 ... L_X`. Its length is `X`.\nThe length of `M_1 M_2 ... M_X` is `sum len(M_i)`.\nIf `X` is large, then `sum len(M_i)` is large.\nThe number of distinct letter sequences that can be generated by a string `T` is `f(T)`.\n`f(T) <= 2^4 * f(T[1:])` is a loose bound.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences starting at a position `k` is `2^max_morse_len - 1` if all characters are identical. In this case, `15`.\nIf characters are mixed, it's still bounded by `15`?\nNo, for `S=\"10101010\"`, `h_dp[0]` for \"10101010\" is `fib(8)`-like.\n`fib(8)=21`. `fib(9)=34`. `fib(10)=55`.\nThe maximum size of `h_dp[k]` is `fib(N-k+2)`.\nThis is still exponential in `N-k`.\n\nThere must be an `O(M^2)` solution that does not store `h_dp[k]` as sets.\nThis means counting distinct paths in a DAG without explicitly listing them.\nThis is usually done by `dp[i] = (dp[i+1] + dp[i+2] + ...)`.\nBut this is only for a specific definition of \"paths\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    INVALID_CODES = {\n        \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"\n    }\n    \n    # Precompute all valid Morse codes of length 1 to 4\n    # For hashing, we need a unique integer for each letter.\n    # Since there are 26 letters, we can map them to 0-25.\n    # We will use polynomial hashing for sequences.\n    # P1, MOD1 and P2, MOD2 for double hashing.\n    P1 = 31 # A prime number larger than 26 (number of letters)\n    MOD1 = 10**9 + 7\n    P2 = 37\n    MOD2 = 10**9 + 9\n\n    # Assign a unique integer ID to each valid Morse code string\n    # and precompute its hash for length 1.\n    # This acts as a mapping from Morse code string to its 'letter hash'.\n    letter_hash_map = {}\n    current_letter_id = 1 # Start from 1 to avoid 0 hash issues for single letters\n    \n    # Generate all possible strings of length 1 to 4\n    # and assign unique hash values to valid ones.\n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        for i in range(2**length):\n            morse_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(length)\n            if morse_str not in INVALID_CODES:\n                # Store (hash1, hash2) for the single letter\n                letter_hash_map[morse_str] = (current_letter_id % MOD1, current_letter_id % MOD2)\n                current_letter_id += 1\n\n    # S_list will store the current Morse code string\n    S_list = []\n    \n    # h_dp[k] will store the set of (hash1, hash2) tuples for all distinct\n    # sequences of letters that can be formed by parsing S_list[k...N-1].\n    # N is the current length of S_list.\n    h_dp = [] \n\n    # total_unique_hashes will store the set of (hash1, hash2) tuples for all distinct\n    # sequences of letters found across all substrings of S_list.\n    total_unique_hashes = set()\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        char = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S_list.append(char)\n        N_new = len(S_list)\n\n        # Append an empty set for h_dp[N_new] (representing an empty suffix, no sequences)\n        h_dp.append(set()) \n\n        # Calculate h_dp[k] for k from N_new-1 down to 0\n        # h_dp[k] depends on h_dp[k+1], h_dp[k+2], h_dp[k+3], h_dp[k+4]\n        for k in range(N_new - 1, -1, -1):\n            current_suffix_hashes = set()\n            \n            # Try to form sequences starting at S_list[k] with a Morse code of length 1 to 4\n            for length in range(1, 5):\n                if k + length <= N_new:\n                    sub = \"\".join(S_list[k : k + length])\n                    if sub in letter_hash_map:\n                        L_hash1, L_hash2 = letter_hash_map[sub]\n                        \n                        # Add the sequence consisting of just this letter L\n                        current_suffix_hashes.add((L_hash1, L_hash2))\n                        \n                        # If there's a suffix S_list[k+length...N_new-1],\n                        # append L to all sequences from that suffix.\n                        # h_dp[k+length] is the set of sequences for S_list[k+length...N_new-1]\n                        for seq_h1, seq_h2 in h_dp[k + length]:\n                            new_h1 = (L_hash1 * P1 + seq_h1) % MOD1\n                            new_h2 = (L_hash2 * P2 + seq_h2) % MOD2\n                            current_suffix_hashes.add((new_h1, new_h2))\n            \n            h_dp[k] = current_suffix_hashes\n            \n            # Add all unique sequences starting at S_list[k] to the global set\n            total_unique_hashes.update(h_dp[k])\n        \n        sys.stdout.write(str(len(total_unique_hashes)) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
