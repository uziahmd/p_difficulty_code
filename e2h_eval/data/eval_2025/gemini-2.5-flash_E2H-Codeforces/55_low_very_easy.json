    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Lexicographically Smallest String Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this string manipulation problem. The goal is to find the smallest string lexicographically, but with some clever swap rules: adjacent '0' and '1' can trade places, and adjacent '1' and '2' can too.  However, and this is crucial, '0' and '2' can *never* swap directly.  My brain immediately goes to analyzing these allowed swaps and what they *imply* about character order.\n\nEssentially, '0's can navigate around '1's, and '2's can also weave around '1's.  But those pesky '0's and '2's are fundamentally blocked from each other.  It's like they're on different sides of a fence. This restriction becomes the central point.\n\nNow, my initial instinct is to push the '0's as far left as possible to minimize the string lexicographically. Similarly, the '2's want to be as far right as possible.  The '1's? They're the flexible intermediaries. However, the '0' and '2' block is a game-changer.  If I see a \"0...2\" sequence, the '0' will *always* stay to the left of that '2', no matter what I do.  The relative order of these characters is the key.\n\nThis means '0's can essentially move freely within a group of '0's and '1's, and '2's can move freely within a group of '1's and '2's.  The '1's are really the workhorses here - they can rearrange themselves around everything else.\n\nThe core idea crystallizes: the *relative positions* of '0's and '2's are immutable. If a '0' is initially to the left of a '2', that ordering will be preserved in any resulting string. My strategy boils down to preserving this inherent ordering.\n\nSo, I'm thinking about counting the '0's, '1's, and '2's.  Let's call them `count0`, `count1`, and `count2`, respectively.  Ideally, to minimize the string, I want a pattern like `00...011...122...2`. But, given the '0'/'2' block, if a '2' comes before a '0' in the original string, this ideal arrangement is likely impossible.\n\nThe '1's are my wildcard. They can go wherever they need to, effectively grouped together amongst other numbers. I need a way to build the resulting string to respect the initial relative order of '0's and '2's to find the smallest possible arrangement.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. Swapping adjacent '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' and '1' can swap: `01 <-> 10`\n2. '1' and '2' can swap: `12 <-> 21`\n\nThe crucial restriction is that '0' and '2' cannot swap. This means a '0' can never cross a '2', and a '2' can never cross a '0'.\nIf we have a '0' at index `i` and a '2' at index `j`, and `i < j`, then this specific '0' will always remain to the left of this specific '2'.\nSimilarly, if `i > j`, this '0' will always remain to the right of this '2'.\n\nConsider the characters '0' and '2'. Their relative order is fixed. We can think of all '0's and '2's as forming a \"skeleton\" string, where their positions relative to each other are immutable.\nFor example, if the original string is `s = \"100210\"`, the '0's and '2's are at indices 1, 2, 3, 5. The sequence of these characters is `0020`. This relative order `0020` must be preserved.\n\nNow consider the '1's. A '1' can swap with a '0' (`01 <-> 10`) and with a '2' (`12 <-> 21`). This means a '1' can effectively move past any '0' or any '2'. Therefore, all '1's can be grouped together. They can be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's, as long as they don't violate the '0'-'2' restriction.\n\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by '1's, then '2's.\nSince '0's cannot cross '2's, we can't always move all '0's to the very beginning if there's a '2' before them.\n\nLet's count the total number of '1's in the string. Let this be `count1`.\nAll these `count1` ones can be moved together. Where should they be placed to minimize the string lexicographically?\n\nTo achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we want to put '0's first.\nAll '0's can move past each other. All '2's can move past each other.\nAll '0's can move past '1's. All '1's can move past '2's.\n\nThis implies that all '0's that appear *before* any '2's in the original string can effectively be grouped together at the very beginning of the final string.\nSimilarly, all '2's that appear *after* any '0's in the original string can effectively be grouped together at the very end of the final string.\n\nThe '1's are \"flexible\". They can be moved past '0's and '2's.\nConsider the sequence of '0's and '2's in the original string. Let's call this `s_02`.\nFor example, `s = \"100210\"`. `s_02` is `0020`.\n`s = \"11222121\"`. `s_02` is `2222`.\n`s = \"20\"`. `s_02` is `20`.\n\nAll '1's can be moved to any position relative to the '0's and '2's.\nTo make the string lexicographically minimal, we want '0's first, then '1's, then '2's.\nThe '0's that appear before any '2's in `s_02` can be moved to the very beginning.\nThe '2's that appear after any '0's in `s_02` can be moved to the very end.\n\nThe key insight is that all '1's can be moved past any '0' or '2'. This means all '1's can be collected and placed together. Where should this block of '1's go?\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want '0's first. We can place all '0's that are not blocked by a '2' at the beginning.\nThen we want '1's.\nThen we want '2's.\n\nSince '0's cannot cross '2's, any '0' that appears before a '2' in the original string will appear before it in the final string.\nAny '2' that appears before a '0' in the original string will appear before it in the final string.\n\nLet's count the total number of '0's, '1's, and '2's in the input string `s`.\n`num_0 = s.count('0')`\n`num_1 = s.count('1')`\n`num_2 = s.count('2')`\n\nThe '1's are special because they can interact with both '0's and '2's. This allows them to \"bridge\" the gap or move around freely.\nConsider the '0's and '2's. Their relative order is fixed.\nFor example, if the string is `s = \"20\"`, the result is `20`. We can't move '0' before '2'.\nIf the string is `s = \"02\"`, the result is `02`.\n\nWhat if there are '1's? `s = \"210\"`. `num_0=1, num_1=1, num_2=1`.\n`\"210\" -> \"120\"` (swap '2','1') -> `120` (no more swaps possible to improve)\nThis `1` is stuck between `2` and `0`.\nWait, `120` is not lexicographically smaller than `210`. `210` -> `201` (swap '1','0'). `201` is the smallest.\nThe example `20` output `20` is correct.\nThe example `100210` output `001120` is correct.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed\" idea.\nThis is true: a '0' cannot pass a '2' and a '2' cannot pass a '0'.\nThis means that if we remove all '1's from the string, the remaining sequence of '0's and '2's will appear in the final string in the same relative order.\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`. Remove '1's: `\"0020\"`.\nThe final string for this example is `001120`. Notice `0020` is a subsequence of `001120`.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n1. Extract all '0's and '2's from the original string, maintaining their relative order. Let's call this `s_prime`.\n2. Count the total number of '1's in the original string. Let this be `num_ones`.\n3. Construct the result string. We want to place '0's first.\n   Iterate through `s_prime`.\n   If we encounter a '0', append it to the result.\n   If we encounter a '2', this means we have reached a point where we can no longer place '0's (from `s_prime`) before this '2'. At this point, all the `num_ones` can be inserted. After inserting all '1's, then append the '2' and the rest of `s_prime`.\n\nThis suggests that all '1's should be grouped together and inserted *just before the first '2'* encountered in `s_prime`.\nIf there are no '2's in `s_prime` (i.e., `s` contains only '0's and '1's), then all '0's go first, then all '1's.\nIf there are no '0's in `s_prime` (i.e., `s` contains only '1's and '2's), then all '1's go first, then all '2's.\n\nLet's try this strategy:\n1. Count `num_ones = s.count('1')`.\n2. Construct a string `res` by iterating through `s`.\n   If `s[i]` is '0', append '0' to `res`.\n   If `s[i]` is '2', append '2' to `res`.\n   (We ignore '1's for now, they are counted in `num_ones`).\n3. Find the first occurrence of '2' in `res`. Let its index be `idx_first_2`.\n   If no '2' exists in `res` (i.e., `res` contains only '0's), then the final string is `res` followed by `num_ones` '1's.\n   Otherwise, the final string is `res[0:idx_first_2]` (all '0's before the first '2'), followed by `num_ones` '1's, followed by `res[idx_first_2:]` (the first '2' and all subsequent '0's and '2's).\n\nLet's test with examples:\n`s = \"100210\"`\n1. `num_ones = 2`\n2. `s_prime` (string of '0's and '2's) from `s`: `\"0020\"`\n3. `idx_first_2` in `s_prime` is at index 2 (value `s_prime[2] = '2'`).\n   `s_prime[0:2]` is `\"00\"`.\n   `s_prime[2:]` is `\"20\"`.\n   Result: `\"00\"` + `num_ones` '1's (`\"11\"`) + `\"20\"` = `\"001120\"`. This matches the example output.\n\n`s = \"11222121\"`\n1. `num_ones = 4`\n2. `s_prime` from `s`: `\"2222\"`\n3. `idx_first_2` in `s_prime` is at index 0.\n   `s_prime[0:0]` is `\"\"`.\n   `s_prime[0:]` is `\"2222\"`.\n   Result: `\"\"` + `num_ones` '1's (`\"1111\"`) + `\"2222\"` = `\"11112222\"`. This matches the example output.\n\n`s = \"20\"`\n1. `num_ones = 0`\n2. `s_prime` from `s`: `\"20\"`\n3. `idx_first_2` in `s_prime` is at index 0.\n   `s_prime[0:0]` is `\"\"`.\n   `s_prime[0:]` is `\"20\"`.\n   Result: `\"\"` + `num_ones` '1's (`\"\"`) + `\"20\"` = `\"20\"`. This matches the example output.\n\n`s = \"000\"`\n1. `num_ones = 0`\n2. `s_prime` from `s`: `\"000\"`\n3. No '2' in `s_prime`.\n   Result: `s_prime` (`\"000\"`) + `num_ones` '1's (`\"\"`) = `\"000\"`. Correct.\n\n`s = \"111\"`\n1. `num_ones = 3`\n2. `s_prime` from `s`: `\"\"`\n3. No '2' in `s_prime`.\n   Result: `s_prime` (`\"\"`) + `num_ones` '1's (`\"111\"`) = `\"111\"`. Correct.\n\nThis strategy seems robust. It correctly places all '0's that are not blocked by a '2' at the beginning, then all '1's, then the remaining '2's (and any '0's that were after those '2's).
