Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Crazy Town Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and it's pretty straightforward once you break it down. We're given the home and university coordinates, and a set of roads represented as lines. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of road crossings needed to get from home to the university. It's essentially a geometric problem in disguise.\n\nThe key insight, as I see it, is that each road acts as a boundary, dividing the plane into two half-planes.  Any point in one half-plane is separated from any point in the other half-plane by the road. The beauty lies in using the sign of the equation of the line, `aix + biy + ci = 0`. If I plug in the coordinates of a point `(x, y)`, the sign of the result tells me which side of the line that point lies on.  Zero means it's on the line, but we know neither home nor the university is on any of the roads.\n\nSince the problem guarantees no points lie on a road, calculating `ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci` and `ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci` for the home and university locations and for each road, respectively, is the real solution. If the signs of these two values are different, that means the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, and we *have* to cross it. If the signs are the same, they're on the same side, and we can ignore that road.\n\nEssentially, I just need to iterate through each road, perform these calculations, and increment a counter whenever I detect a sign change between the home and university side of the road. That counter will then represent the minimum number of steps.  Simple, elegant, and efficient. I have a plan for a Python script.\n",
