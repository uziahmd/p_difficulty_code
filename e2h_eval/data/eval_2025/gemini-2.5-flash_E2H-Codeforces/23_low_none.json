            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the Tile-Drawing Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with solving this competitive programming problem involving Mahjong-like tiles. Tokitsukaze needs to figure out the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a \"mentsu\" (either a triplet or a sequence) from her initial three tiles. The tile supply is infinite, so I can draw any tile I want.\n\nMy approach is to consider cases. First, I want to see if the initial three tiles already form a mentsu.  If so, the answer is zero extra tiles. To check for this, I need to look for two possible scenarios. First, the tiles are identical (a triplet or \"koutsu\"). Second, they form a consecutive sequence of the same suit (\"shuntsu\").\n\nIf the initial three tiles *don't* already form a mentsu, I need to check if drawing a single extra tile can complete one. This means examining each pair of tiles from the original hand and considering what the ideal fourth tile would be to create a complete set of three.  This is a matter of checking all combinations and seeing if a suitable extra tile exists for each pair.  If any of these scenarios yield a valid mentsu with the addition of one tile, the answer is one extra tile.\n\nFinally, if neither the initial three tiles, nor any combination of them plus a single tile, yields a mentsu, I know the answer must be two extra tiles.\n\nI'll need to represent the tiles in a structured way, like (number, suit) tuples, to make comparison and checking easier. So, I will parse the input strings accordingly. This will help with processing and checking all combinations. The code should reflect this logical flow, first checking for zero extra tiles, then one, and finally assuming two extra tiles are required if no other condition is met. I think I've got a solid plan!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw (0, 1, or 2) to form at least one mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu) from her hand. She starts with three tiles.\n\nLet's define the tile structure and mentsu types:\n- A tile is represented by a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s).\n- A **koutsu (triplet)** consists of three identical tiles, e.g., [1m, 1m, 1m].\n- A **shuntsu (sequence)** consists of three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit, e.g., [1m, 2m, 3m] or [5s, 6s, 7s]. The order of tiles does not matter.\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of draws, so we check for 0 draws first, then 1 draw, then 2 draws.\n\nFirst, parse the input tiles into a more manageable format. A good way is to convert each tile string (e.g., \"1s\") into a tuple `(number, suit)` (e.g., `(1, 's')`). Since the order of tiles doesn't matter for forming mentsu, it's often helpful to sort the tiles. When checking for sequences, it's crucial to have the numbers sorted.\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `T1, T2, T3`.\n\n**0 Extra Tiles Needed:**\nCheck if `T1, T2, T3` already form a mentsu.\n1.  **Check for Koutsu:** Are `T1, T2, T3` all identical?\n    Example: `1m 1m 1m`\n2.  **Check for Shuntsu:**\n    a. Are all three tiles of the same suit?\n    b. If yes, extract their numbers. Sort the numbers: `n1, n2, n3`.\n    c. Check if `n2 == n1 + 1` and `n3 == n2 + 1`.\n    Example: `1s 2s 3s` (after sorting: `1s, 2s, 3s`)\n\nIf either of these conditions is met, the answer is 0.\n\n**1 Extra Tile Needed:**\nIf 0 extra tiles are not sufficient, check if drawing one tile `T4` allows forming a mentsu from any three tiles in `T1, T2, T3, T4`. This implies that two of the original tiles `Ti, Tj` can form a potential mentsu with one drawn tile `Tk`. We iterate through all unique pairs of initial tiles: `(T1, T2)`, `(T1, T3)`, `(T2, T3)`.\n\nFor each pair `(Ti, Tj)`:\n1.  **Potential Koutsu:** Are `Ti` and `Tj` identical? If yes, drawing a third identical tile `Ti` (or `Tj`) would form a koutsu.\n    Example: `3p 3p` needs `3p`.\n2.  **Potential Shuntsu:** Are `Ti` and `Tj` of the same suit?\n    a. If yes, let their numbers be `ni, nj`. Sort them: `min_n, max_n`.\n    b. Check if `max_n == min_n + 1`. This means they are consecutive.\n        - We can draw `min_n - 1` (if `min_n > 1`) or `max_n + 1` (if `max_n < 9`) to form a shuntsu.\n        Example: `2p 3p` needs `1p` or `4p`.\n    c. If `max_n == min_n + 2`. This means there's a gap of one.\n        - We can draw `min_n + 1` to form a shuntsu.\n        Example: `2p 4p` needs `3p`.\n\nIf any of these conditions are met for any pair of initial tiles, the answer is 1.\n\n**2 Extra Tiles Needed:**\nIf 0 or 1 extra tiles are not sufficient, then we need 2 extra tiles. This is always possible.\nFor example, we can always draw two tiles that match one of the original tiles to form a koutsu. If `T1` is `1m`, we can draw two more `1m` tiles to form `[1m, 1m, 1m]`.\nThus, the maximum answer is 2.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Use a helper function to parse tile strings.\n- Store tiles as tuples `(number, suit)`.\n- When checking for shuntsu, sort the numbers of the tiles to handle cases like `5s 7s 6s` correctly.\n- Use a `set` to store unique tiles to easily count occurrences or check for identical tiles.\n\nLet's walk through an example: `3p 9m 2p`\nParsed tiles: `[(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]`\n\n**Check 0 draws:**\n- Koutsu: Not `3p 3p 3p`, not `9m 9m 9m`, not `2p 2p 2p`. No triplet.\n- Shuntsu:\n    - Suits: `p, m, p`. Not all same suit. No sequence.\nResult for 0 draws: No mentsu.\n\n**Check 1 draw:**\nIterate through pairs of initial tiles:\n1.  Pair `(3p, 9m)`:\n    - Not identical.\n    - Different suits.\n    No mentsu with 1 draw.\n2.  Pair `(3p, 2p)`: (Order doesn't matter, internally sort to `(2p, 3p)`)\n    - Not identical.\n    - Same suit (`p`). Numbers are `2, 3`.\n    - `max_n (3) == min_n (2) + 1`. They are consecutive.\n        - We can draw `min_n - 1 = 1` (tile `1p`). Set `[1p, 2p, 3p]` is a shuntsu.\n        - We can draw `max_n + 1 = 4` (tile `4p`). Set `[2p, 3p, 4p]` is a shuntsu.\n    Since we found a way to form a mentsu with 1 draw, the minimum is 1.\n\nThe output for `3p 9m 2p` is `1`.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    s_tiles = input().split()\n    \n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for s_tile in s_tiles:\n        num = int(s_tile[0])\n        suit = s_tile[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles for consistent processing, especially for sequences\n    # Sorting by suit then by number helps with grouping\n    tiles.sort()\n\n    # --- Check for 0 extra tiles ---\n    # A mentsu is formed by the initial three tiles\n\n    # Check for Koutsu (triplet)\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for Shuntsu (sequence)\n    # All must be of the same suit\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]:\n        # Numbers must be sequential\n        nums = sorted([tiles[0][0], tiles[1][0], tiles[2][0]])\n        if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # --- Check for 1 extra tile ---\n    # A mentsu can be formed by two initial tiles and one drawn tile.\n    # We iterate through all unique pairs of initial tiles.\n\n    # Use a set to avoid duplicate pairs if initial tiles are identical\n    # e.g., if input is 1m 1m 2m, we only care about (1m, 1m) and (1m, 2m)\n    # unique_tiles_present = list(set(tiles)) # This is not quite right, we need to consider all 3 original positions\n    \n    # Generate all unique pairs of indices\n    pairs_indices = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)]\n\n    for i, j in pairs_indices:\n        t1, t2 = tiles[i], tiles[j]\n\n        # Potential Koutsu (triplet)\n        # If two tiles are identical, drawing a third identical tile forms a koutsu.\n        if t1 == t2:\n            print(1)\n            return\n        \n        # Potential Shuntsu (sequence)\n        # Both tiles must be of the same suit\n        if t1[1] == t2[1]:\n            n1, n2 = t1[0], t2[0]\n            # Ensure n1 is always the smaller number for easier comparison\n            if n1 > n2:\n                n1, n2 = n2, n1\n            \n            # Case 1: n1 and n2 are consecutive (e.g., 2m 3m)\n            # Can draw n1-1 (if >0) or n2+1 (if <10)\n            if n2 == n1 + 1:\n                # e.g., 2m 3m -> need 1m or 4m\n                print(1)\n                return\n            \n            # Case 2: n1 and n2 have a gap of 1 (e.g., 2m 4m)\n            # Can draw n1+1\n            if n2 == n1 + 2:\n                # e.g., 2m 4m -> need 3m\n                print(1)\n                return\n\n    # --- Check for 2 extra tiles ---\n    # If 0 or 1 extra tiles are not sufficient, then 2 extra tiles are always enough.\n    # For example, take any of the initial tiles (e.g., tiles[0]) and draw two more identical tiles\n    # to form a koutsu.\n    print(2)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
