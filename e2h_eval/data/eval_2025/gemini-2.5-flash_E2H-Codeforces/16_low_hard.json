Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "**The Crazy Town Solution Path**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to write a Python script for this \"Crazy Town\" problem. It's a classic competitive programming setup: given home and university coordinates, a bunch of road equations, and the challenge of figuring out the minimum steps needed to get from home to the university.\n\nMy first thought is always to understand the input and the constraints. We have two coordinate pairs for home and university, then a list of road equations – each in the form `aix + biy + ci = 0`. The key here is the movement rule: we can only move if our blocks share a non-zero length common border, which means we're crossing a line segment, not just passing through a point. And the output is just the minimum number of steps. There are also a lot of guarantees about the data. `ai` and `bi` are not zero and no two roads are identical.\n\nThe core idea I'm latching onto is that these roads are essentially dividing the plane into distinct regions, or \"blocks\". To move between blocks, we *have* to cross a road. So, the problem boils down to counting the minimum number of roads we *must* cross to get from home to university.\n\nThis is where the mathematical representation kicks in. For each road `ax + by + c = 0`, we can evaluate `ax + by + c` for the home and university coordinates. If the signs of these evaluations are the *same*, then home and university are on the same side of the road, and crossing that road isn't necessary. If the signs are *different*, then they're on opposite sides, and we absolutely *must* cross that road.\n\nThe beauty of this approach is its simplicity. By checking the signs for each road, I can determine which roads act as \"barriers\" between the home and university. If home and university are on opposite sides of k roads, then those are the k roads that must be crossed at least once. Since a step means crossing one road, the minimum steps are simply k. This will be an efficient solution, with O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of roads.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing home) to a target block (containing the university). A step is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent block, which means crossing a common border of non-zero length. This implies crossing exactly one road.\n\nEach road, defined by the equation `aix + biy + ci = 0`, divides the plane into two half-planes. For any point `(x, y)`, the expression `aix + biy + ci` will have a certain sign.\n*   If `aix + biy + ci > 0`, the point is on one side of the line.\n*   If `aix + biy + ci < 0`, the point is on the other side of the line.\n*   If `aix + biy + ci = 0`, the point is on the line itself.\n\nSince it's guaranteed that neither your home nor the university lies on any road, for any given road `i`, we can evaluate `val_home = ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci` and `val_uni = ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci`.\n\n1.  **If `val_home` and `val_uni` have the same sign** (both positive or both negative), it means both your home and the university are located on the same side of road `i`. To travel from home to the university, you do *not* need to cross this particular road `i`.\n\n2.  **If `val_home` and `val_uni` have different signs** (one positive and the other negative), it means your home and the university are located on opposite sides of road `i`. To travel from home to the university, you *must* cross this road `i` at least once.\n\nThe minimum number of steps required is simply the count of roads for which your home and the university lie on opposite sides. Each such road acts as a barrier that must be crossed. Since each step crosses exactly one road, the total number of steps is the number of such barrier roads.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read the coordinates of home `(x1, y1)` and university `(x2, y2)`.\n2.  Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n3.  Read the number of roads `n`.\n4.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read the coefficients `ai, bi, ci`.\n    b.  Calculate `val_home = ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci`.\n    c.  Calculate `val_uni = ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci`.\n    d.  Check if `val_home` and `val_uni` have different signs. This can be done by checking if `val_home * val_uni < 0`. If they have different signs, increment `steps`.\n5.  Print the final `steps` count.\n\nThis approach works because the \"regions\" or \"blocks\" are defined by the signs of `a_i x + b_i y + c_i` for all `i`. Moving between adjacent regions means changing the sign of exactly one such expression. The problem asks for the minimum number of such changes required to get from the initial configuration of signs (at home) to the final configuration of signs (at university). This is equivalent to counting how many `i` values have different signs for `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    steps = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for the home coordinates\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Evaluate the line equation for the university coordinates\n        val_uni = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If val_home and val_uni have different signs, it means home and university\n        # are on opposite sides of this road.
