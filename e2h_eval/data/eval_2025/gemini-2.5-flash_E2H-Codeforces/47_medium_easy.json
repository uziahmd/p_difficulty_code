    "thought": "**Optimizing LCM: Finding the Minimal `k`**\n\nI'm aiming to craft a Python script to tackle the \"Neko does Maths\" programming challenge. The objective is to pinpoint the smallest non-negative integer, `k`, that minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k`. Essentially, I want to minimize `lcm(a+k, b+k)`.\n\nTo solve this, I've defined `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`, and leveraged the relationship: `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.  Here, `gcd` denotes the greatest common divisor. I then focused on how the greatest common divisor relates to the problem.\n\nLet's introduce `g = gcd(x, y)`. Since `g` is a divisor of both `x` and `y`, it must also divide their difference, `y - x`, which simplifies to `b - a`. Thus, `g` is a divisor of `d = |b - a|`.\n\nIf `a` equals `b`, the task is simple.  `k = 0` provides the solution because `lcm(a, a) = a`, and there is no smaller k.  For cases where `a` doesn't equal `b` (the most complex scenario), `d` is greater than zero, and I will have to iterate through all possible divisors `g` of `d`.\n\nFor a specific divisor `g`, I'm looking for the smallest non-negative `k` that makes both `a+k` and `b+k` multiples of `g`.  This gives us `k = -a % g`.\n\nNow, for each `g`, calculate `k` and get `x` and `y`.  We determine `current_gcd` and the `current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd`.  I'll store the `min_lcm` and the smallest corresponding `ans_k`, updating them as I encounter smaller LCMs. When equal LCMs are found, select the smaller `k`.\n\nLet's refine the divisor-finding.  Instead of iterating from `1` to `d`, I'll iterate from `1` to the square root of `d` and check for divisors.\n\nFinally, the output should be `ans_k`. With the refined approach, the Python script should efficiently and correctly solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that `lcm(a+k, b+k)` is minimized. If multiple `k` values yield the same minimum LCM, we should choose the smallest `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know the relationship `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nA key property of `gcd` is that `gcd(X, Y)` divides `|X - Y|`.\nIn our case, `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must divide `|(b+k) - (a+k)| = |b - a|`.\nLet `diff = |b - a|`.\nThis implies that `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `diff`.\n\nThis insight allows us to iterate through all possible values for `gcd(a+k, b+k)`. Let's call this value `g`.\nFor each divisor `g` of `diff`, we want to find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` and `b+k` are both multiples of `g`.\n1. `a+k` must be a multiple of `g`, which means `a+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`, or `k \\equiv -a \\pmod g`. The smallest non-negative `k` satisfying this is `k = (-a) % g`.\n2. If `a+k` is a multiple of `g`, and `b-a` is a multiple of `g` (since `g` is a divisor of `diff = |b-a|`), then `b+k = (a+k) + (b-a)` must also be a multiple of `g`. So, satisfying `a+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g` automatically ensures `b+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`.\n\nSo, for each divisor `g` of `diff`:\n- Calculate `k = (-a) % g`. This `k` ensures that both `a+k` and `b+k` are multiples of `g`.\n- Let `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`.\n- Calculate the actual `gcd(x, y)`. Let this be `current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)`. Note that `current_gcd` will be a multiple of `g` (or equal to `g`), and also a divisor of `diff`.\n- Calculate the `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) // current_gcd`.\n- We keep track of the minimum `lcm` found so far (`min_lcm`) and the corresponding `k` (`ans_k`).\n- If `current_lcm < min_lcm`, we update `min_lcm = current_lcm` and `ans_k = k`.\n- If `current_lcm == min_lcm`, we update `ans_k = min(ans_k, k)` to satisfy the condition of choosing the smallest `k`.\n\n**Edge Case: `a = b`**\nIf `a = b`, then `diff = 0`. In this case, `lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize `a+k`, we should choose the smallest non-negative `k`, which is `k=0`. So, if `a=b`, the answer is `0`.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Read `a` and `b`.\n2. If `a == b`, print `0` and exit.\n3. Calculate `diff = abs(b - a)`.\n4. Initialize `min_lcm = float('inf')` and `ans_k = 0`. (The `k=0` case is always considered when `g=1`, which sets an initial `min_lcm` and `ans_k=0`).\n5. Find all divisors of `diff`. We can do this by iterating `i` from `1` up to `sqrt(diff)`. If `i` divides `diff`, then both `i` and `diff // i` are divisors. Store these divisors in a set to handle duplicates (e.g., when `i*i == diff`).\n6. For each `g` in the set of divisors:\n   a. Calculate `k = (-a) % g`.\n   b. Calculate `x = a + k` and `y = b + k`.\n   c. Calculate `current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)`.\n   d. Calculate `current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd`.\n   e. If `current_lcm < min_lcm`:\n      `min_lcm = current_lcm`\n      `ans_k = k`\n   f. Else if `current_lcm == min_lcm`:\n      `ans_k = min(ans_k, k)`\n7. Print `ans_k`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n- `a, b <= 10^9`, so `diff` can be up to `10^9 - 1`.\n- Finding divisors takes `O(sqrt(diff))` time. `sqrt(10^9)` is approximately `31622`.\n- The number of divisors for a number up to `10^9` is relatively small (at most 1344 for `735134400`).\n- Inside the loop, `math.gcd` and arithmetic operations are efficient. `x*y` can be up to `(2*10^9)^2 = 4*10^{18}`, which fits within standard 64-bit integers and is handled by Python's arbitrary-precision integers.\nThe overall complexity is dominated by finding divisors, which is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Handle the edge case where a and b are equal.\n    # In this case, lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k.\n    # To minimize a+k, we choose the smallest non-negative k, which is k=0.\n    if a == b:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"0\\n\")\n        return\n\n    diff = abs(b - a)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    ans_k = 0  # Initialize ans_k. k=0 is always a candidate when g=1.\n\n    # Find all divisors of diff.\n    # gcd(a+k, b+k) must be a divisor of diff.\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):\n        if diff % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(diff // i)\n\n    # Iterate through each possible value 'g' for gcd(a+k, b+k).\n    # 'g' must be a divisor of 'diff'.\n    for g in divs:\n        # Find the smallest non-negative k such that a+k is a multiple of g.\n        # This means k = -a (mod g).\n        k = (-a) % g\n        \n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        \n        # Calculate lcm(x, y) = (x * y) // gcd(x, y).\n        # Python's integers handle arbitrary size, so x*y won't overflow.\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n\n        # Update min_lcm and ans_k based on the current_lcm.\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm:\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            ans_k = k\n        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n            # If current_lcm is equal to min_lcm, choose the smallest k.\n            ans_k = min(ans_k, k)\n            \n    sys.stdout.write(str(ans_k) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
