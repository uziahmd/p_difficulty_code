    "thought": "**Lexicographically Smallest String: My Final Algorithm**\n\nOkay, here's the thought process distilled into its essential form. I'm looking for the lexicographically smallest string achievable by swapping adjacent '0's and '1's or '1's and '2's, while forbidding swaps between '0' and '2'. This means the relative order of '0's and '2's is *fixed*.\n\nThe core insight is this: the '0's and '2's form an immutable skeleton. If I extract the subsequence of only '0's and '2's from the original string, that subsequence's relative order must be preserved. '1's are free to move anywhere relative to this skeleton.\n\nSo, here's my plan:\n1.  **Extract the skeleton**: I'll create `s_02`, a string containing only the '0's and '2's from the input string.\n2.  **Count the '1's**: I'll tally the number of '1's, stored in `num_ones`.\n3.  **Find the critical point**: I'll look for the first '2' in `s_02`.\n4.  **Construct the minimal string**: I will concatenate all '0's that appear *before* the first '2' (in the original, filtered '0'2 string) to the beginning. Then I'll add all the '1's (count `num_ones`). Finally, I will add the *rest* of the string from the first '2'. I will be careful to handle the situation where there are no 2s present in the extracted string.\n\nBy doing this, I ensure:\n*   I'm preserving the order of '0's and '2's.\n*   I'm putting as many '0's as possible at the beginning (the prefix), followed by all the '1's, ensuring the smallest possible value.\n*  '1's can freely move past 0s and 2s, but the ordering of 0s and 2s are preserved.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or adjacent '1' and '2'. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' and '1' can swap: \"01\" <-> \"10\". This means '0's can move freely past '1's (and vice versa).\n2. '1' and '2' can swap: \"12\" <-> \"21\". This means '1's can move freely past '2's (and vice versa).\n\nThe crucial constraint is that '0' and '2' cannot swap directly. This implies that the relative order of any '0' and any '2' in the string is invariant. If an original string has a '0' at index `i` and a '2' at index `j` with `i < j`, then in any reachable string, that specific '0' must still appear before that specific '2'. Similarly, if `i > j`, the '2' must remain before the '0'. Since all '0's are identical and all '2's are identical, this means the subsequence formed by only '0's and '2's (when all '1's are removed) must be preserved in the final string.\n\nLet's illustrate:\nIf `s = \"010210\"`, the subsequence of '0's and '2's is \"0020\". This \"0020\" structure must be maintained.\nThe '1's, however, are very flexible. Since a '1' can swap with both '0' and '2', it can effectively move past any '0' or any '2'. This means all '1's can be grouped together and inserted anywhere into the '0'/'2' subsequence.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning, then as many '1's as possible, and finally the '2's.\n\nHere's the strategy based on this observation:\n1. **Extract the '0's and '2's subsequence**: Iterate through the input string `s`. Collect all '0's and '2's in their original relative order into a new list or string (let's call it `s_02_list`). Count the total number of '1's (`num_ones`).\n   Example: `s = \"010210\"`\n   `s_02_list` would be `['0', '0', '2', '0']`\n   `num_ones` would be `2`\n\n2. **Identify the split point for '1's**: To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put all '0's first, then all '1's, then all '2's. The '1's can be inserted anywhere. The optimal place for them is after all '0's that can legally move to the front, and before any '2's that constrain the '0's. This \"legal split point\" is precisely where the first '2' appears in `s_02_list`.\n   - Find the index of the first '2' in `s_02_list`. Let this be `first_two_idx`.\n   - All characters in `s_02_list` *before* `first_two_idx` are '0's. These '0's can move to the very beginning of the string, as they are not constrained by any '2's that precede them in `s_02_list`.\n   - All characters in `s_02_list` *from* `first_two_idx` onwards form the rest of the '0'/'2' structure.\n\n3. **Construct the result string**:\n   - Take the prefix of `s_02_list` up to (but not including) `first_two_idx`. These are the initial '0's.\n   - Append all `num_ones` '1's.\n   - Append the rest of `s_02_list` (from `first_two_idx` onwards).\n\nLet's apply this to the examples:\n\n**Example 1: `s = \"100210\"`**\n1. `s_02_list = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`, `num_ones = 2`.\n2. `first_two_idx` (index of '2' in `s_02_list`) is `2`.\n   - Prefix: `s_02_list[0:2]` -> `['0', '0']`\n   - Suffix: `s_02_list[2:]` -> `['2', '0']`\n3. Result: `\"\".join(['0', '0']) + \"1\" * 2 + \"\".join(['2', '0'])` = `\"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\"` = `\"001120\"`.\n\n**Example 2: `s = \"11222121\"`**\n1. `s_02_list = ['2', '2', '2', '2']`, `num_ones = 4`.\n2. `first_two_idx` (index of '2' in `s_02_list`) is `0`.\n   - Prefix: `s_02_list[0:0]` -> `[]` (empty string)\n   - Suffix: `s_02_list[0:]` -> `['2', '2', '2', '2']`\n3. Result: `\"\" + \"1\" * 4 + \"\".join(['2', '2', '2', '2'])` = `\"1111\" + \"2222\"` = `\"11112222\"`.\n\n**Example 3: `s = \"20\"`**\n1. `s_02_list = ['2', '0']`, `num_ones = 0`.\n2. `first_two_idx` (index of '2' in `s_02_list`) is `0`.\n   - Prefix: `s_02_list[0:0]` -> `[]` (empty string)\n   - Suffix: `s_02_list[0:]` -> `['2', '0']`\n3. Result: `\"\" + \"1\" * 0 + \"\".join(['2', '0'])` = `\"\" + \"\" + \"20\"` = `\"20\"`.\n\nThis approach correctly handles cases where there are no '2's (all '0's and '1's), no '0's (all '1's and '2's), or only '1's, because `s_02_list.find('2')` will return -1, and the slicing logic needs to be adjusted slightly for that. If `first_two_idx` is -1, it means there are no '2's in `s_02_list`. In this case, all '0's can come first, then all '1's. This means `s_02_list` itself is the prefix, and the suffix is empty.\n\nRefined construction:\n```python\ns_02_chars = []\nnum_ones = 0\nfor char in s:\n    if char == '0':\n        s_02_chars.append('0')\n    elif char == '1':\n        num_ones += 1\n    else: # char == '2'\n        s_02_chars.append('2')\n\ns_02_str = \"\".join(s_02_chars)\nfirst_two_idx = s_02_str.find('2')\n\nresult = \"\"\nif first_two_idx == -1: # No '2's in the string\n    result = s_02_str + '1' * num_ones\nelse:\n    result = s_02_str[:first_two_idx] + '1' * num_ones + s_02_str[first_two_idx:]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis logic is sound because:\n- The relative order of '0's and '2's is preserved by construction.\n- All '0's that can appear before any '2' are grouped at the very beginning. This maximizes the '0's at the start.\n- All '1's are placed immediately after these initial '0's. Since '1' < '2', placing '1's here is always lexicographically better than placing a '2'. All '1's can move to this position because they can swap with both '0's and '2's.\n- The remaining '0's and '2's (which start with the first '2' from the `s_02` subsequence) are appended, maintaining their relative order.\n\nThe time complexity will be O(N) for iterating through the string, and O(N) for string concatenations/joining, where N is the length of the input string. The space complexity will be O(N) for storing `s_02_chars` and the result string. Given N up to $10^5$, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    s_02_chars = []\n    num_ones = 0\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            s_02_chars.append('0')\n        elif char == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else: # char == '2'\n            s_02_chars.append('2')\n\n    s_02_str = \"\".join(s_02_chars)\n    \n    # Find the first occurrence of '2' in the '0'/'2' subsequence\n    first_two_idx = s_02_str.find('2')\n\n    result = \"\"\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        # If no '2's are present, all '0's can go first, then all '1's.\n        result = s_02_str + '1' * num_ones\n    else:\n        # All '0's before the first '2' in s_02_str can be moved to the very beginning.\n        # Then all '1's.\n        # Then the rest of s_02_str (which starts with the first '2').\n        result = s_02_str[:first_two_idx] + '1' * num_ones + s_02_str[first_two_idx:]\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(result + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
