A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem: A Python Approach**\n\nAlright, I need to craft a Python script to tackle the \"Soft Drinking\" problem. Let's break this down into digestible pieces. The goal is clear: maximize the number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring they all get the same amount.\n\nFirst, I have to understand the input and the constraints: `n` friends, `k` bottles, `l` ml per bottle, `c` limes, `d` slices per lime, `p` grams of salt, and then the per-friend, per-toast requirements for drink (`nl`) and salt (`np`).\n\nIt's about calculating how many toasts can be made, limited by each resource.  The core idea is to find the *limiting resource* and base the calculation on that. The problem specifies they \"all drink the same amount\", so it's a group effort.\n\nI have to carefully calculate the available resources: the total drink, the total lime slices, and the total salt. I'll then determine how many toasts can be made from *each* resource.  \n\nFor the *total drink*, I'll calculate `k * l`. Then, since each friend needs `nl` ml per toast, the group needs `n * nl` ml *for one toast*. This makes sense. The total number of toasts possible using the available drink is then `(k * l) / (n * nl)`.\n\nNext, for the *lime slices*, the total is `c * d`. The group needs one slice per friend, thus `n * 1` slices *for one toast*. The available number of toasts is `(c * d) / n`.\n\nFinally, *for the salt*, I'll do `p` total grams, with each friend needing `np` per toast. The group needs `n * np` for one toast. The number of toasts is `p / (n * np)`.\n\nI'll calculate the number of toasts that can be made with each resource, and take the minimum of those values. The minimum represents the number of total toasts that all the friends can make. Then, I need to find how many toasts each person makes.\n",
