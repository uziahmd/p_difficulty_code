    "thought": "**Reflecting on the Lexicographically Smallest String Problem**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to find the smallest string we can get by swapping adjacent '0' and '1', or '1' and '2' characters. First, I had to figure out what kind of swaps are even allowed and what the implications of each move are. '0' and '1' can swap directly, and '1' and '2' can too. But, '0' and '2'? No dice. They can't just pass through each other. It's like they're blocked by a '1', if it's placed just right.\n\nThis led to a pretty cool realization: the relative order of the '0's and '2's in the original string *must* be preserved. If a '0' comes before a '2' originally, it'll *always* be before the '2' in the final string, and vice versa. It's like they're magnetically locked in place. The '1's, on the other hand, are free as birds. They can move past any '0' or '2' since the relevant swaps are allowed.\n\nThis meant I could simplify the problem.  I needed to preserve the relative order of '0's and '2's, then figure out where to insert the '1's to make the string as small as possible.  My initial thought was to just put all '0's first, then all '1's, then all '2's.  But, the fixed order of the '0's and '2's stopped me.\n\nSo, I refined the strategy:\n1.  Count how many '1's we have.\n2.  Strip all the '1's out of the string, keeping the '0's and '2's in their original order.\n3.  Then, slot those '1's into the correct place in that '0'/'2' string.\n\nThe magic spot for the '1's? Right before the *first* '2'. Why? Because if we put a '1' after a '2', the string will always be lexicographically larger than it could be. And because the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed, we had to preserve the placement of any '0's that came before any '2's.\n\nIf the string doesn't have any '2's, we just group the '1's at the end. It's pretty elegant, actually. In essence, any '0's before a '2' stay put, any '1's are grouped together right before the first '2' or at the end if there are no '2's, and then the rest of the original string (the part from the first '2' on) remains unchanged. I went through some rigorous testing using various edge cases and examples to make sure the program was behaving as it should. The solution is now ready.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by repeatedly swapping adjacent '0' and '1' characters, or adjacent '1' and '2' characters. Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '0' can swap with '1': `01 <-> 10`\n2. '1' can swap with '2': `12 <-> 21`\n\nA critical observation is about the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n- A '0' cannot directly swap with a '2'.\n- Can a '0' move past a '2' indirectly? Consider the sequence `012`.\n  - Swapping '0' and '1' gives `102`. The '0' is still before the '2'.\n  - Swapping '1' and '2' gives `021`. The '0' is still before the '2'.\n  In both cases, the '0' remains to the left of the '2'. Similarly, from `210`, we can get `120` or `201`, but `2` remains to the left of `0`. This implies that the relative order of '0's and '2's is invariant. If an original string has a '0' at index `i` and a '2' at index `j` with `i < j`, then in any reachable string, that specific '0' will always appear before that specific '2'.\n\nThis means that if we filter out all '1's from the original string `s`, the resulting subsequence of '0's and '2's (let's call it `s_02`) will maintain its character order in the final string. For example, if `s = \"100210\"`, then `s_02 = \"0020\"`. The final string must contain \"0020\" as a subsequence, in that exact order.\n\nNow, consider the '1's.\n- A '1' can swap with an adjacent '0' (`01 <-> 10`). This means a '1' can move past any '0'.\n- A '1' can swap with an adjacent '2' (`12 <-> 21`). This means a '1' can move past any '2'.\nSince a '1' can move past any '0' or any '2', all '1's are completely mobile with respect to the '0's and '2's. This implies that all '1's can be grouped together as a contiguous block.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as early as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\nGiven that the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed, we should insert the block of '1's into the `s_02` subsequence.\nTo minimize the string lexicographically:\n1. Any '0' should come before any '1'.\n2. Any '1' should come before any '2'.\n\nCombining these, all '1's should be placed after all '0's that appear before any '2's in `s_02`, and before any '2's (and any '0's that appear after those '2's). This means the ideal position for the block of '1's is immediately before the *first* '2' in the `s_02` subsequence.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Count the total number of '1's in the input string `s`. Let this be `num_ones`.\n2. Construct a new string (or list of characters) `s_without_ones` by removing all '1's from `s`. This string represents the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's.\n3. Find the index of the first occurrence of '2' in `s_without_ones`.\n   - If '2' is not found in `s_without_ones` (meaning `s_without_ones` contains only '0's, or is empty), then all '1's should be placed at the very end. The result will be `s_without_ones` followed by `num_ones` '1's.\n   - If '2' is found at index `idx_first_two` in `s_without_ones`, the result string will be constructed as follows:\n     - The part of `s_without_ones` before `idx_first_two` (these are all '0's).\n     - Followed by `num_ones` '1's.\n     - Followed by the part of `s_without_ones` from `idx_first_two` onwards (this includes the first '2' and all subsequent '0's and '2's).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`s = \"100210\"`):**\n1. `num_ones = 2` (two '1's in \"100210\").\n2. `s_without_ones = \"0020\"` (removing '1's from \"100210\").\n3. Find the first '2' in \"0020\". It's at index `2`. So, `idx_first_two = 2`.\n4. Construct the result:\n   - `s_without_ones[0:2]` which is \"00\".\n   - `num_ones` '1's, which is \"11\".\n   - `s_without_ones[2:]` which is \"20\".\n5. Concatenate these parts: \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\".\n\nThis matches the example output and ensures the lexicographically smallest string while respecting the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nThe solution reads lines from standard input, processing each line as a separate string `s`, and prints the result to standard output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        if not s: # Handle potential empty lines or end of input\n            continue\n\n        num_ones = 0\n        s_without_ones_chars = [] # Use a list to build string efficiently\n\n        # Step 1 & 2: Count '1's and build s_without_ones\n        for char in s:\n            if char == '1':\n                num_ones += 1\n            else:\n                s_without_ones_chars.append(char)\n        \n        s_without_ones = \"\".join(s_without_ones_chars)\n\n        # Step 3: Find the insertion point for '1's\n        idx_first_two = s_without_ones.find('2')\n\n        result_parts = []\n        if idx_first_two == -1:\n            # No '2's in s_without_ones, so append all '1's at the end\n            result_parts.append(s_without_ones)\n            result_parts.append('1' * num_ones)\n        else:\n            # Insert '1's right before the first '2'\n            result_parts.append(s_without_ones[0:idx_first_two])\n            result_parts.append('1' * num_ones)\n            result_parts.append(s_without_ones[idx_first_two:])\n        \n        print(\"\".join(result_parts))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
