After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the \"Marks\" Problem and Crafting a Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Marks\" problem, and my initial thought is, \"This is straightforward.\" It involves a gradebook, students, subjects, and identifying the \"successful\" students.  It's a classic example where a structured approach will lead to a clean solution.\n\nThe problem input seems manageable: two numbers, `n` and `m` representing students and subjects, followed by the actual grades.  That's easy enough to read in. The goal is to count how many students are successful – meaning they're the best in at least one subject.\n\nThe core of the logic is to determine the highest mark for each subject and then see which students match those highest marks. I see two main steps: first finding the maximum mark per subject and second, comparing each student's mark to that maximum to determine success.\n\nReading the grades is key. I'm thinking a list of lists will work well, or even a list of strings, with each inner string being the set of marks for one student. I'll need to remember to convert those character marks to integers, though.  So `grades[i][j]` will be student `i`'s mark for subject `j`.\n\nFor the maximum marks, I'll probably iterate through the subjects, then iterate through the students for each subject, finding the maximum.  I can store those max marks in a separate list, `max_marks_per_subject`.\n\nThen, I'll need to iterate through each student and each subject, checking if their mark equals the subject's maximum.  If there's a match, I'll mark that student as \"successful\" and move on.  A set seems like a good data structure for keeping track of successful students to avoid duplicates.\n\nThinking more about efficiency, I could combine finding the maximum and checking for successful students. It makes more sense to first compute the `max_marks_per_subject` as `max_marks_per_subject[j]`. Then in the nested loops to check for successful students, if I come across the `max_marks_per_subject[j]`, I'll know that the current student `i` is a successful one.\n\nThe final count of successful students will be the size of that successful students' set. It's a classic problem that can be handled using nested loops to get the required output.\n",
