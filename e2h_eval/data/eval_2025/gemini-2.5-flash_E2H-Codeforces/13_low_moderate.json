For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**The Approach to Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to classify these triads. The goal is straightforward: given three notes, determine if the chord is major, minor, or something \"strange.\"  I'm dealing with musical notes, so I need to think about them in terms of semitones and distances.\n\nFirst, I'm going to map each note to a number between 0 and 11. This way, I can easily calculate the distance between notes using modular arithmetic. C is 0, C# is 1, and so on. The distance between two notes will be the difference between their numerical representations, modulo 12, adding 12 if the difference is negative. This handles the cyclic nature of the notes.\n\nNow, the core of the problem lies in recognizing the major and minor triad patterns. A major triad has a specific interval structure: a major third (4 semitones) followed by a minor third (3 semitones), or vice versa. A minor triad has a minor third (3 semitones) followed by a major third (4 semitones), also with the reverse order allowed. Importantly, the total distance between the root and the fifth is 7 semitones.\n\nSince the input is an *unordered* set of notes, I'll need to consider all possible orderings of the three notes. There will be six possible permutations (3! = 6) to test for the major/minor intervals. I'll calculate the distances between each pair of notes in each permutation and check if they match the major or minor pattern. If a permutation matches either pattern, I can classify the triad accordingly. If none of the permutations fit, then it's \"strange.\"\n",
    "response": "The problem requires classifying a three-note chord (triad) as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" based on the semitone distances between its notes when ordered appropriately.\n\nFirst, we establish a mapping from note names to numerical values (0-11) to easily calculate semitone distances. The notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, which we map to 0 through 11 respectively.\n\nThe distance between two notes `n1` and `n2` (their numerical representations) is calculated as `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. This gives the upward distance from `n1` to `n2`.\n\nA major triad has an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and from Y to Z is 3 semitones. The total distance from X to Z will be 7 semitones.\n\nA minor triad has an ordering (X, Y, Z) such that the distance from X to Y is 3 semitones, and from Y to Z is 4 semitones. The total distance from X to Z will also be 7 semitones.\n\nSince the input chord is an unordered set of three notes, we need to check all possible permutations of the given notes. For each permutation (let's say `[note_a, note_b, note_c]` after sorting numerically), we calculate the three cyclic distances:\n1. `d1 = (note_b - note_a + 12) % 12`\n2. `d2 = (note_c - note_b + 12) % 12`\n3. `d3 = (note_a - note_c + 12) % 12`\n\nThese `d1, d2, d3` represent the distances between adjacent notes in the sorted cyclic order. Their sum `d1 + d2 + d3` must always be 12.\n\nA major chord will have distances `(4, 3, 5)` in some cyclic order (e.g., `d1=4, d2=3, d3=5`).\nA minor chord will have distances `(3, 4, 5)` in some cyclic order (e.g., `d1=3, d2=4, d3=5`).\n\nWe can achieve this by:\n1. Reading the three input notes.\n2. Converting them to their numerical representations.\n3. Sorting these three numbers to get `n1, n2, n3`.\n4. Calculating the three \"gaps\" between them:\n   `gap1 = (n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`\n   `gap2 = (n3 - n2 + 12) % 12`\n   `gap3 = (n1 - n3 + 12) % 12`\n5. Checking if the tuple `(gap1, gap2, gap3)` (or any cyclic shift of it) matches `(4, 3, 5)` for major or `(3, 4, 5)` for minor. Since the order of `gap1, gap2, gap3` depends on the initial sorting, it's simpler to just check if the *set* of these gaps matches the set `{3, 4, 5}`. If it does, then we need to determine the specific type.\n\nThe problem guarantees that the answer will always be unambiguous. This means if a chord's gaps are `(4, 3, 5)` in some order, it's major, and if they are `(3, 4, 5)` in some order, it's minor.\n\nLet's use the sorted numerical notes `n1, n2, n3`.\nThe distances `d1 = n2 - n1`, `d2 = n3 - n2`, `d3 = 12 - (n3 - n1)`.\nThese are the distances `n1->n2`, `n2->n3`, `n3->n1` (cyclically).\nA major chord will have `(d1, d2, d3)` as a cyclic permutation of `(4, 3, 5)`.\nA minor chord will have `(d1, d2, d3)` as a cyclic permutation of `(3, 4, 5)`.\n\nWe can check these conditions directly:\n- If `(d1, d2)` is `(4, 3)` or `(d2, d3)` is `(4, 3)` or `(d3, d1)` is `(4, 3)`, it's major.\n- If `(d1, d2)` is `(3, 4)` or `(d2, d3)` is `(3, 4)` or `(d3, d1)` is `(3, 4)`, it's minor.\nIf neither, it's strange.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    note_map = {\n        \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n        \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n    }\n\n    notes_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Convert notes to their numerical representation\n    notes_val = [note_map[n] for n in notes_str]\n    \n    # Sort the notes numerically to simplify distance calculation\n    # This gives us n1 <= n2 <= n3\n    notes_val.sort() \n    \n    # Iterate through all 3 possible starting notes (roots) of the chord\n    # For each root, calculate the two subsequent intervals in the sequence\n    # and check if they match major (4, 3) or minor (3, 4) patterns.\n    \n    # The three possible cyclic orderings of the notes are:\n    # (notes_val[0], notes_val[1], notes_val[2])\n    # (notes_val[1], notes_val[2], notes_val[0])\n    # (notes_val[2], notes_val[0], notes_val[1])\n\n    for i in range(3):\n        x = notes_val[i]\n        y = notes_val[(i + 1) % 3]\n        z = notes_val[(i + 2) % 3]\n        \n        # Calculate distance from x to y\n        dist_xy = (y - x + 12) % 12\n        \n        # Calculate distance from y to z\n        dist_yz = (z - y + 12) % 12\n        \n        if dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        \n        if dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n            \n    # If no major or minor pattern was found after checking all permutations\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
