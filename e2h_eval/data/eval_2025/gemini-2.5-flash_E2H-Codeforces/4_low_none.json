The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Rock-Paper-Scissors Losses**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Rock-Paper-Scissors problem. The user wants a Python script to figure out how many times each player, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, loses over a large number of rounds. I need to design an efficient algorithm.\n\nThe core of this is understanding the cyclic nature of the game. Nikephoros and Polycarpus both use repeating patterns (sequences) of Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The real challenge is the large number of rounds, up to 2 billion, which rules out simulating each round directly. That's way too slow, O(n) complexity.\n\nI need to exploit the cyclic behavior. Since their strategies are cyclic, the outcome of each round will also eventually repeat. The period of this repetition is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences, `m` and `k`.  I'm dealing with `n` rounds, with `m, k <= 1000`. So, the LCM will be at most 1,000,000, which is manageable.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1. **Calculate Losses for One Cycle:** I'll first determine the cycle length, which is `LCM(m, k)`. Then, I'll simulate a single cycle of the game. For each round within this cycle, I'll figure out who wins or loses, keeping track of Nikephoros's and Polycarpus's losses.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Losses:** Once I have the losses for one full cycle, I can easily calculate the losses for the total number of rounds. I'll divide the total rounds `n` by the cycle length to find the number of full cycles. The losses from the full cycles will be the losses per cycle multiplied by the number of cycles. Then, I need to account for the remaining rounds, which is the remainder after the division. I'll simply simulate those remaining rounds and add the losses to the total.\n\nSo, the complexity of this is effectively O(LCM(m,k)) plus the relatively quick calculations to multiply and take the remainder, so it becomes a constant time operation after calculating the losses per cycle. It's a much faster solution compared to the naive one.\n",
