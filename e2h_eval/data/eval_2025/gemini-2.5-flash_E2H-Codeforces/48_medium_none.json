            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script that takes a number, initially in one base, and converts it to a different base.  The trick is that the target base might be a regular integer, or it could be 'R' for Roman numerals. I've broken this down into logical steps.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input.  That involves parsing the base `a`, the target base `b` (which is a string, and could be \"R\"), and the number itself `c`.  Then comes the conversion process.\n\nThe heart of the solution is in these core functions:\n\n1.  **`base_to_dec()`**:  This function will take the input number (as a string) in base `a` and convert it to its equivalent decimal (base 10) value. I need to handle digits beyond '9' (A, B, C, etc.) up to the maximum base of 25.\n\n2.  **`dec_to_base()`**:  This handles converting the decimal number to a new integer base `b`. Again, I need to deal with digits that aren't just '0'-'9'.\n\n3.  **`dec_to_roman()`**:  This is for the case where `b` is 'R'. This is a different conversion, so I'll need a distinct algorithm. Roman numerals have specific rules. I have to create this algorithm to do the decimal-to-Roman conversion.\n\nI'm thinking about edge cases too. The number `c` might have leading zeros, which should be ignored in the input. Also, if `b` is an integer base, the output should not have leading zeros, unless the answer is just `0` itself. For `dec_to_roman()`, the problem specifies the number will not be zero if Roman numeral conversion is expected.\n\nI have Roman numeral conversion in particular, I'll need a lookup table (or dictionary) that maps the decimal values to their Roman symbols, in descending order. And also that the total value is not greater than 3000.  Then I can iteratively subtract the largest possible Roman value from the decimal number.\n\nFinally, I will test my code with various examples, ensuring everything is handled, especially the base conversions and special cases.  I'll start with simple examples, and then test with edge cases and larger values. My script's main flow will be: read input, convert to decimal, and then convert from decimal to the target base.  I'm confident I can make this work correctly.\n",
