The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games.

    "thought": "**The Number Games - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Number Games\" problem, and my initial thought is, this seems like a classic graph problem with a greedy twist. We're given a tree, which simplifies things. The input tells us we have `n` districts and need to remove `k` of them while keeping a connected component. And we want to maximize the fans, which are calculated as powers of 2.\n\nThe key insight, as an expert, is to recognize that maximizing the sum of fans (2<sup>i</sup>) is the same as maximizing the sum of the district indices (`i` values). The exponential growth of powers of 2 makes this a natural priority system. I should keep the districts with the highest indices and drop the rest. \n\nThis means, I should try keeping `n`, then `n-1`, and so on, as long as the remaining nodes stay connected. Any path going through a removed node is broken, that's important to keep in mind.\n\nMy first thought on an algorithm is to start from the district with the highest index, `n`. Then, check if keeping it maintains a connected component. If it does, keep it. Then move to `n-1` and do the same, and so on, until I have kept `n-k` districts. The ones I couldn't keep should be the `k` that are removed. Now, to translate that into code... I need to consider an efficient way to check for connectivity with each removal. That's my next step.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to remove exactly `k` contestants (districts) from a total of `n` districts, such that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component. Our goal is to maximize the total number of fans of the remaining contestants. The number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`. We need to output the district numbers of the removed contestants in increasing order.\n\n**Understanding the Graph and Fan Maximization:**\nThe problem states that there's exactly one path between any two districts, which means the nation's districts and roads form a **tree**.\nTo maximize the sum `sum(2^i)`, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices. This is because `2^i` grows exponentially, so `2^X` is always greater than the sum of all `2^Y` for `Y < X`. For example, `2^N > 2^(N-1) + 2^(N-2) + ... + 2^1`. Therefore, a greedy strategy of keeping the largest possible district indices is optimal for maximizing the sum of fans.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts. To maximize the sum of fans, we should try to keep the `n-k` districts with the largest indices possible, while ensuring they form a connected component.\nLet's consider the districts in decreasing order of their index: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe must keep district `n` because it has the largest fan count. If we don't keep `n`, we can't achieve the maximum possible sum.\nAfter keeping `n`, we try to keep `n-1`. If `n-1` is adjacent to `n`, keeping both `n` and `n-1` forms a connected component. If `n-1` is not adjacent to `n`, but is adjacent to some other district `X` which is on the path from `n` to `n-1`, then we would need to keep `X` as well. This suggests a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) approach.\n\n**BFS/DFS Approach:**\n1.  Start a traversal (e.g., BFS) from the district with the largest index, `n`.\n2.  Maintain a count of `kept_districts`. Initially, `kept_districts = 0`.\n3.  When we visit a district `u` during the BFS, if `u` has not been kept yet, we \"keep\" it (add it to our set of kept districts) and increment `kept_districts`.\n4.  Add all neighbors of `u` to the BFS queue.\n5.  We continue this process until we have `n-k` kept districts.\n6.  All districts that were *not* kept by this BFS are the ones to be removed.\n\n**Why this works:**\nBy starting the BFS from `n` and exploring its neighbors, then their neighbors, and so on, we are effectively expanding a connected component. Since BFS explores nodes layer by layer, it naturally finds nodes that are \"closest\" to the starting node `n`. If we prioritize nodes with higher indices when adding them to the `kept` set (which BFS does not inherently do, but we can modify it to), we would get the optimal solution.\n\nHowever, a simpler observation is that if we run a BFS starting from district `n` and keep *all* reachable districts until we have `n-k` districts, we are effectively keeping the `n-k` districts that are \"closest\" to `n` in terms of path length, *and* that include `n` itself. This set of `n-k` districts will be connected. The problem is that BFS doesn't prioritize larger indices among equally distant nodes.\n\n**Corrected Greedy Approach:**\nThe problem is to select a connected component of size `n-k` that maximizes `sum(2^i)`. This is equivalent to selecting a connected component of size `n-k` that maximizes `sum(i)`.\nThe districts with smaller indices are `1, 2, ..., k`. If we remove `k` districts, we should remove the `k` districts with the smallest indices *if possible* while maintaining connectivity.\n\nLet's maintain a set `S` of `n-k` districts we want to keep. Initially, `S` is empty.\nWe iterate through districts `i` from `n` down to `1`.\nFor each district `i`:\n1.  If `i` is already in `S`, continue.\n2.  If `|S| == n-k`, we have enough districts. All remaining districts (with indices smaller than `i`) and any `j` not in `S` are removed.\n3.  If `|S| < n-k`:\n    *   We want to add `i` to `S`.\n    *   If `S` is currently empty, add `i` (which must be `n`).\n    *   If `S` is not empty, adding `i` must maintain connectivity with the existing nodes in `S`. This means `i` must be adjacent to at least one node already in `S`, or `i` must be on a path between two nodes already in `S`. This is difficult to check efficiently.\n\nA more effective greedy approach is to determine the `k` districts to remove. We should remove districts with the smallest indices.\nConsider districts `1, 2, ..., n`. We want to remove `k` districts.\nLet's try to remove district `1`. If removing `1` doesn't disconnect the remaining `n-1` districts, then we can tentatively remove `1`. This is only true if `1` is a leaf node. If `1` is not a leaf node, removing it might disconnect the graph.\n\nThe key insight for tree problems involving removing nodes to keep a connected component is often related to \"pruning\" leaves.\nIf we want to keep a connected component of size `N_kept = n-k`, we can think of it as starting with the entire tree and repeatedly \"pruning\" leaf nodes that we want to remove.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. To maximize the sum of `2^i`, we should remove nodes with the smallest possible `i` values.\n\nLet's use a min-priority queue (or a `collections.deque` for a BFS-like approach) to keep track of candidate nodes to remove.\nInitialize a `degree` array for each node.\nInitialize a `removed_count = 0`.\nInitialize `removed_districts` list.\nAdd all leaf nodes (degree 1) to a queue. These are the prime candidates for removal, as removing them is least likely to disconnect the graph.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Build the adjacency list for the tree.\n2.  Calculate the initial `degree` of each node.\n3.  Initialize a queue `q` with all nodes `i` that have `degree[i] == 1` (leaf nodes).\n4.  Initialize a `removed` boolean array (or set) to `False` for all nodes.\n5.  Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n6.  Initialize `removed_districts_list = []`.\n\n7.  Iterate while `removed_count < k`:\n    a.  If `q` is empty, it means all remaining nodes have degree > 1 (they form a cycle or a path where both ends are not leaves). This shouldn't happen in a tree unless `n-k` is 1. If `n-k` is 1, and we have `n-1` nodes to remove, we remove all nodes except `n`. If `n-k > 1`, and `q` is empty, it means we have removed all leaves. The remaining graph is a path or a single node. In this case, we need to remove interior nodes. This implies our greedy choice of only removing leaves is incomplete.\n\n    Let's refine the greedy choice:\n    We want to keep `n-k` nodes. The `n-k` nodes must form a connected component.\n    The nodes we *don't* keep are the `k` removed nodes.\n    The most valuable node is `n`. We *must* keep node `n`.\n    This means node `n` cannot be one of the `k` removed nodes. So we mark `n` as `kept`.\n    We want to remove `k` nodes. We prefer removing nodes with small indices.\n\n    Consider the nodes in decreasing order of index: `n, n-1, ..., 1`.\n    We want to keep `n-k` nodes.\n    Node `n` is always kept.\n    We can use a modified BFS/DFS starting from `n`.\n    We want to keep `n-k` nodes.\n    Let `kept_nodes` be a set of nodes we keep.\n    Let `q` be a queue for BFS, initialized with `n`.\n    `kept_nodes.add(n)`.\n    `count_kept = 1`.\n\n    While `q` is not empty and `count_kept < n-k`:\n        `u = q.pop_front()`\n        For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n            If `v` is not in `kept_nodes`:\n                `kept_nodes.add(v)`\n                `count_kept++`\n                `q.push_back(v)`\n                If `count_kept == n-k`, break both loops.\n\n    This BFS approach keeps `n` and its \"closest\" `n-k-1` neighbors. This is guaranteed to be connected.\n    However, this doesn't guarantee maximum sum of `2^i`. For example, if `n` is connected to `n-2` and `n-1` is connected to `n-3`, and `n-2` is connected to `n-1`, the BFS from `n` might pick `n-2` first then `n-1` (if `n-2` is closer to `n`). But `n-1` is more valuable than `n-2`.\n\n**The Correct Greedy Approach (from similar problems):**\nTo maximize the sum of values of nodes in a connected component of a specific size `N_kept = n-k`, we should pick the `N_kept` nodes with the largest values that can form a connected component.\nSince `2^i` is strictly increasing, this means picking the `N_kept` nodes with the largest indices.\nThe node `n` *must* be part of the solution.\nWe can think of this as: we have `n` nodes, we need to select `n-k` nodes.\nIt's easier to think about which `k` nodes to remove. We should remove the `k` nodes with the *smallest* indices, provided that removing them leaves a connected component of `n-k` nodes.\n\nLet's maintain a set of nodes that are *not* removed. Initially, this set contains all `n` nodes.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes.\nWe iterate through nodes `i = 1, 2, ..., n`.\nFor each node `i`:\n1.  If `i` is already marked for removal, skip.\n2.  If `i` is the node `n`, we cannot remove it. Skip.\n3.  If we still need to remove nodes (`removed_count < k`):\n    *   Try to remove `i`. A node `i` can be removed if its removal does not disconnect the graph of *currently non-removed* nodes.\n    *   This is tricky. A node `i` can be removed if it's a leaf in the *current* graph of non-removed nodes, and it's not the only node connected to a component. Or, more simply, if removing `i` still leaves `n-k` nodes connected.\n\nThis problem is a classic \"pruning\" problem on trees. We want to remove `k` nodes. To maximize the sum, we remove the `k` nodes with the smallest indices.\nThe problem constraint is that the *remaining* nodes must be connected.\nThis means we can't remove node `n`. So we must remove `k` nodes from `1, ..., n-1`.\n\nConsider the nodes `1, 2, ..., n-1`.\nWe want to remove `k` nodes. The `n-k` nodes must form a connected component.\nThe node `n` is always part of the kept component.\nThe nodes that are *not* kept are the `k` removed nodes.\nWe can model this as a process of \"coloring\" nodes. `n-k` nodes are \"blue\" (kept), `k` nodes are \"red\" (removed).\nNode `n` is blue.\nWe want to make `k` nodes red. We prefer making nodes with small indices red.\n\n**Correct Algorithm (Pruning from leaves):**\nThis is a standard technique for \"keep a connected component of size `X` with max/min sum/value\".\n1.  Build adjacency list `adj`.\n2.  Calculate initial `degree` for each node.\n3.  Initialize a `deque` `q` (for BFS-like processing).\n4.  Initialize a `boolean` array `is_removed[1...n]` to `False`.\n5.  Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n6.  Add all nodes `i` (from `1` to `n-1`) with `degree[i] == 1` to `q`. Node `n` cannot be removed if it's the only remaining node, so we treat it specially. For now, let's assume `n` is not a leaf that gets removed first.\n    *   **Special case**: If `n` itself is a leaf (degree 1), we should *not* add it to the queue for removal. We *must* keep `n`.\n    *   So, add `i` to `q` if `degree[i] == 1` AND `i != n`.\n    *   If `n` has degree 0 (only node in graph), this is `n=1`. But `k < n`, so `n >= 2`.\n\n7.  While `removed_count < k` and `q` is not empty:\n    a.  `u = q.pop_front()`.\n    b.  If `is_removed[u]` is already `True` (e.g., due to duplicate entries in queue or degree changes), continue.\n    c.  Mark `u` as `is_removed[u] = True`.\n    d.  Add `u` to `removed_districts_list`.\n    e.  `removed_count++`.\n    f.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        i.  Decrement `degree[v]`.\n        ii. If `degree[v] == 1` and `v` is not `n` (or `v` is `n` but it's not the last node remaining, i.e., `n-removed_count > 1`):\n            *   Add `v` to `q`.\n            *   **Crucially**: To prioritize removing smaller indices, we should use a min-priority queue (or sort `q` if it's a list, but that's inefficient). A `deque` processes in FIFO order. If we want to remove smallest indices first among leaves, we should sort `q` or use a `heapq`.\n\n**Revised Algorithm (using a min-heap for leaves):**\n1.  Build adjacency list `adj` for `n` nodes.\n2.  Calculate initial `degree` for each node.\n3.  Initialize `min_heap = []` (using `heapq` module).\n4.  Initialize `is_removed[1...n]` to `False`.\n5.  Initialize `removed_count = 0`.\n6.  Initialize `removed_districts_list = []`.\n\n7.  For `i` from `1` to `n`:\n    a.  If `i == n`, `is_removed[n]` should remain `False`. We prioritize keeping `n`.\n    b.  If `degree[i] == 1` and `i != n`:\n        *   `heapq.heappush(min_heap, i)`.\n\n8.  While `removed_count < k` and `min_heap` is not empty:\n    a.  `u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)`.\n    b.  If `is_removed[u]` is already `True`, continue (this can happen if `u` was added to heap multiple times or its degree changed before it was processed).\n    c.  Mark `is_removed[u] = True`.\n    d.  Add `u` to `removed_districts_list`.\n    e.  `removed_count++`.\n    f.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        i.  If `is_removed[v]` is `False`:\n            *   `degree[v]--`.\n            *   If `degree[v] == 1` and `v != n`:\n                *   `heapq.heappush(min_heap, v)`.\n            *   **Edge case**: What if `v` becomes a leaf, and `v` is `n`? `n` should not be removed unless `n-k` is 0, which is not allowed (`k < n`). If `n` becomes a leaf and there are still more than 1 node remaining (`n-removed_count > 1`), `n` is safe. If `n` is the *only* node left, it must be kept.\n\n9.  After the loop, if `removed_count < k`:\n    This means we've removed all possible leaves (except `n`) and still need to remove more nodes. The remaining graph is a path or a single node `n`. We need to remove `k - removed_count` more nodes. These nodes must be interior nodes.\n    To select these interior nodes, we again prioritize smallest indices.\n    Iterate `i` from `1` to `n`. If `is_removed[i]` is `False` and `i != n`, add `i` to a temporary list `remaining_interior_nodes`. Sort this list. Remove the first `k - removed_count` nodes from this list.\n    This is incorrect. If we remove an interior node, it splits the component.\n    The goal is to keep *one* connected component of size `n-k`.\n\n    The logic for pruning leaves is correct. If we run out of leaves to prune, it means the remaining graph is a single node (which must be `n`) or a path.\n    If the remaining graph is a path, say `P = x1 - x2 - ... - xm`, and we need to remove more nodes. We should remove the ends of the path that have smaller indices.\n    For example, if we need to remove 1 more node, and the path is `1-2-3-4-5`, and we've already removed leaves `6,7,8`. We can remove `1` or `5`. We remove `1`.\n    This implies that after pruning all leaves, we might need to prune from the \"ends\" of the remaining path-like structure.\n\n    Let's simplify. The problem asks us to keep `N_kept = n-k` nodes.\n    The nodes `1, ..., n` have values `2^1, ..., 2^n`.\n    We must keep `n`.\n    We want to keep `N_kept-1` more nodes.\n    We can do a \"reversed BFS\" or \"reversed Dijkstra\".\n    Start with `n`. Expand outwards. Keep nodes with highest values.\n\nLet's trace the sample 1: `n=6, k=3`. We need to keep `6-3=3` nodes.\nEdges: `(2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)`.\nAdj:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\nDegrees:\n1: 1\n2: 4\n3: 1\n4: 1\n5: 1\n6: 2\n\n`n=6`.

Don't add `2` to `min_heap`.\n\n2.  `u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)` -> `u = 3`.\n    `is_removed[3] = True`. `removed_districts_list = [1, 3]`. `removed_count = 2`.\n    Neighbor of `3` is `2`.\n    `degree[2]--` -> `degree[2]` becomes `2`.\n    `degree[2]` is not `1`. Don't add `2` to `min_heap`.\n\n3.  `u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)` -> `u = 4`.\n    `is_removed[4] = True`. `removed_districts_list = [1, 3, 4]`. `removed_count = 3`.\n    Neighbor of `4` is `2`.\n    `degree[2]--` -> `degree[2]` becomes `1`.\n    `degree[2] == 1` and `2 != n`. Add `2` to `min_heap`.\n    `min_heap = [2, 5]` (sorted order, `2` is smaller than `5`).\n\nLoop terminates because `removed_count == k`.\n`removed_districts_list = [1, 3, 4]`.\nThis matches the sample output!\n\n**What if `min_heap` becomes empty before `removed_count == k`?**\nThis means all remaining non-`n` nodes have degree > 1 (they form cycles, which is not possible in a tree, or a path).\nIf `min_heap` is empty, it means all remaining nodes (except `n`) have degree `> 1`. This implies the remaining nodes form a path-like structure, with `n` possibly being one of its endpoints or an internal node.\nExample: `n=5, k=2`. Path `1-2-3-4-5`.\nAdj: `1:[2], 2:[1,3], 3:[2,4], 4:[3,5], 5:[4]`\nDegrees: `1:1, 2:2, 3:2, 4:2, 5:1`\n`n=5`. Keep `5`.\nInitial `min_heap`: `[1]`. (Node `5` is a leaf, but `i==n`, so not added).\n\n`removed_count = 0`. Need to remove `k=2` nodes.\n\n1.  `u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)` -> `u = 1`.\n    `is_removed[1] = True`. `removed_districts_list = [1]`. `removed_count = 1`.\n    Neighbor of `1` is `2`.\n    `degree[2]--` -> `degree[2]` becomes `1`.\n    `degree[2] == 1` and `2 != n`. Add `2` to `min_heap`.\n    `min_heap = [2]`.\n\n2.  `u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)` -> `u = 2`.\n    `is_removed[2] = True`. `removed_districts_list = [1, 2]`. `removed_count = 2`.\n    Neighbor of `2` are `1` (removed) and `3`.\n    `v = 3`. `is_removed[3]` is `False`.\n    `degree[3]--` -> `degree[3]` becomes `1`.\n    `degree[3] == 1` and `3 != n`. Add `3` to `min_heap`.\n    `min_heap = [3]`.\n\nLoop terminates because `removed_count == k`.\n`removed_districts_list = [1, 2]`.\nRemaining nodes: `3, 4, 5`. These are connected: `3-4-5`. Total `n-k = 3` nodes.\nThis works!\n\nThe logic for `v != n` is crucial. If `v` is `n`, we don't add `n` to the `min_heap` for removal, even if its degree becomes 1. This ensures `n` is always kept unless `n-k=0` (which is not allowed).\n\n**Final check on constraints and edge cases:**\n*   `1 <= k < n <= 10^6`.\n*   `n=2, k=1`. Graph `1-2`. `n=2`. Keep `2`.

Need `k=2`.\n\n    1.  `u = 1`. `removed_count = 1`. `removed_districts_list = [1]`.\n        Neighbor `2`. `degree[2]--` -> `1`. `2 != n`. Add `2` to heap.\n        `min_heap = [2]`.\n\n    2.  `u = 2`. `removed_count = 2`. `removed_districts_list = [1, 2]`.\n        Neighbor `1` (removed). Neighbor `3`. `is_removed[3]` is `False`.\n        `degree[3]--` -> `0`. `3` is `n`. Don't add to heap.\n        `min_heap = []`.\n\n    Loop terminates (`removed_count == k`).\n    `removed_districts_list = [1, 2]`. Correct. Remaining `3`.\n\nThis algorithm seems robust. The time complexity will be `O(N + M log N)` where `M = N-1` for a tree. `N` for building adj list and degrees. `N` for adding initial leaves to heap. Then each edge is processed at most twice (once for each endpoint), and each node is added/removed from heap at most once. So `O(N log N)`. Given `N <= 10^6`, `N log N` is fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n        degree[u] += 1\n        degree[v] += 1\n\n    # min_heap to store potential nodes to remove, prioritized by smallest index\n    min_heap = []\n    is_removed = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # Node 'n' must always be kept (unless n-k=0, which is not allowed by k < n).\n    # So we don't consider 'n' for initial removal even if it's a leaf.\n    # We will only remove 'n' if it's forced (e.g., if we need to remove all other nodes).\n    # But this algorithm keeps 'n' implicitly by not adding it to the heap.\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # A node can be considered for removal if it's a leaf (degree 1)\n        # and it's not the special node 'n' which we want to keep.\n        # If n=1, k=0, this is skipped.
