A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem**\n\nAlright, I've got this \"Soft Drinking\" problem to tackle. Looks straightforward, but I need to be careful with the details. It's essentially a resource allocation problem, limited by the ingredients available.\n\nI'm thinking: I need a Python script to solve this. First, I need to translate the problem description into a workable logic. We have *n* friends, and they want to make as many toasts as possible, but they all need to drink the same amount.\n\nThe ingredients are:\n*   Drink (bottles * ml/bottle)\n*   Limes (number of limes * slices/lime)\n*   Salt (grams of salt)\n\nEach friend needs a specific amount of each resource per toast (ml drink, 1 lime slice, grams of salt).\n\nMy thought process should go like this:\n\n1.  **Calculate Total Available:** Determine the total quantity of each resource: total ml drink, total lime slices, and total grams of salt.\n2.  **Calculate Toasts per Resource:** Figure out how many *individual* toasts each resource allows.  This is simply total resource / resource per toast for that ingredient.  Integer division, of course, because fractional toasts are impossible.\n3.  **Find the Bottleneck:**  The maximum number of *total* toasts possible is the minimum of the individual toast counts. The resource in least supply restricts us.\n4.  **Divide Among Friends:**  Finally, divide the total toasts possible by the number of friends (*n*) to get the toasts per friend.\n\nIt's all about finding the limiting factor.  This example they provide looks good. Let's see if this works. It makes perfect sense, especially with the integer division. I should be able to whip up a Python script implementing this easily.\n",
