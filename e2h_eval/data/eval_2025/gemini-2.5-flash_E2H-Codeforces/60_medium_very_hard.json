Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**I'm tackling a competitive programming problem where the challenge is to count the number of valid sequences of English letters that can be formed by concatenating Morse code representations, given an input string that grows character by character.** The goal is to provide the count modulo 10^9 + 7 after each character is appended to the input string.\n\nThe core idea is to break down the problem by understanding how substrings of the input string can be interpreted as Morse code sequences. Valid sequences consist of letters whose Morse code representations, which can be 1 to 4 bits long, form a substring within the input string.  We have to account for valid Morse codes.  \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\" are invalid.\n\nI'm thinking of this as a dynamic programming problem. I'm trying to define a DP state that will capture the count of these valid sequences.  I initially tried a prefix-based approach, but I realized that I needed to consider all substrings of the current input string, not just the prefixes. My main thought is to use `dp[i]` to represent the total number of valid sequences for any substring ending at the i-th character of the string.  I plan to update `dp[i]` as the string grows.\n\nI've got a bit stuck here, as it seemed as though calculating *all* the substrings was very slow.\n\nI tried a suffix-based approach but realized I wasn't accounting for every possible substring. I am trying to build up the solution character by character. When a new character is added, I need to look at substrings ending at that character. The total count for each new character then includes all the prior characters plus the current values.\n\nTo efficiently count the sequences for a substring, I'm defining a helper function, `W(sub)`, which calculates the number of ways to parse a substring into valid Morse code sequences. I can use dynamic programming within this function itself. The key is in using `g[p]`, which counts the number of sequences for a substring that starts from index p to the end.\n\nThis appears to be a solution that is `O(m^3)` and might be too slow for the constraint. I then optimized it, by creating `f[i]` to count the possible sequences ending at that index, which leads to `sum(f[i] for i in 0...k-1)` in order to compute the total count. I think the idea of building up the solution character by character looks right, but I need to be more efficient with the internal parsing of substrings, so I can arrive at the right final count.  I need to use dynamic programming on substrings, but still efficiently. I'll need a better `dp[k]` formula.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing any substring of a growing string `S` into Morse code representations. We need to report this count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `k`. When a new character is appended, `S` becomes `S + char`, and its length becomes `k+1`. We need to find the total count of sequences for `S` of length `k+1`.\n\nThe total count for `S` of length `k+1` can be expressed as:\n`Total_Count(S_{k+1}) = Total_Count(S_k) + New_Sequences_Ending_At_k`\n\n`New_Sequences_Ending_At_k` refers to all non-empty sequences of English letters whose concatenated Morse code representation is a substring of `S_{k+1}` that ends at index `k`. That is, for all `0 <= j <= k`, we consider the substring `S_{k+1}[j...k]`. For each such substring, we count the number of ways it can be parsed into a sequence of Morse code letters.\n\nLet `count_parse[i]` be the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing the suffix `S[i...k]` (where `k` is the current length of `S` minus 1, i.e., the last index).\nWe can compute `count_parse[i]` using dynamic programming, iterating `i` from `k` down to `0`.\n\nBase case: `count_parse[k+1] = 0` (an empty string cannot form any non-empty sequence).\n\nFor `i` from `k` down to `0`:\n`count_parse[i] = 0`\nFor each valid Morse code `code` of length `L` (from 1 to 4):\n  If `i + L <= k + 1` (meaning `S[i...i+L-1]` is a valid substring of `S`)\n  And `S[i...i+L-1]` is equal to `code`:\n    `count_parse[i] = (count_parse[i] + 1 + count_parse[i+L]) % MOD`\n    Here, `+1` accounts for the sequence consisting of just the single letter corresponding to `code`.\n    `+count_parse[i+L]` accounts for sequences starting with this letter, followed by any sequence formed from `S[i+L...k]`.\n\nAfter computing `count_parse[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `k`, the `New_Sequences_Ending_At_k` is the sum of `count_parse[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `k`.\n`New_Sequences_Ending_At_k = sum(count_parse[i] for i in 0...k) % MOD`.\n\nThe maximum length of `S` is `m = 3000`.\nFor each new character:\n1.  We append the character to `S`. Let its new length be `k+1`.\n2.  We compute `count_parse[i]` for `i` from `k` down to `0`. This loop runs `k+1` times. Inside the loop, we check at most 4 possible Morse code lengths. Each check involves string slicing and comparison, which takes `O(L)` time (where `L` is code length, max 4). So, computing all `count_parse` values takes `O(k * 4 * 4) = O(k)`.\n3.  We sum up `count_parse[i]` values. This takes `O(k)`.\nTotal time complexity for each append operation is `O(k)`.\nSince `k` goes from `0` to `m-1`, the total time complexity is `O(m^2)`.\nFor `m = 3000`, `m^2 = 9 * 10^6`, which is efficient enough.\n\n**Valid Morse Codes**:\nThe problem states that \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\" are not valid.
