    "thought": "**My Approach to the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem and I need to figure out a strategy. The core of it seems to be about constructing a directed graph with specific reachability properties.  I need to find the smallest number of nodes (`n`) and then maximize the unidirectional pairs within that minimal graph.\n\nLet's break down the definitions.  A unidirectional pair is fairly straightforward: a path one way, but not the other.  The `p`-reachable part is key. It's all about counting pairs of nodes `u` and `v` where `u < v` that are bidirectionally reachable.  That \"u < v\" condition hints that a numerical ordering is at play here, which is important to keep in mind.\n\nMy first thought is to understand this \"p-reachable\" concept. If two nodes are bidirectionally reachable, they must be within the same strongly connected component (SCC). If I have an SCC, every node within it can reach every other node.  The problem cleverly frames it as counting the unordered pairs within each SCC where `u < v`.\n\nSo, `p` essentially counts unordered pairs {u,v} within the same SCC. The math looks like `k * (k - 1) / 2` for a single SCC of size `k`.  This is the number of pairs. The task is to create the graph by dividing the total `n` nodes into `m` SCCs with sizes `k1, k2, ..., km`.\n\nI'm thinking now about how to minimize `n` given `p`. Since the `p`-reachable pairs increase quadratically with `k`, while the total `n` increases linearly, I want to form my graph with large SCCs to minimize nodes. To achieve this, I must group as many nodes as possible within the same SCCs.  It's an optimization problem with a quadratic constraint. I can't wait to figure this out!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with the minimum `n` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's first understand the definitions:\n- A graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n- A pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u != v`, there exists a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`**\n\nThe condition \"u and v are reachable from each other\" means that `u` and `v` belong to the same strongly connected component (SCC). The condition `u < v` simply means we are counting unordered pairs of distinct nodes within the same SCC.\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, any two distinct nodes `u, v` within it are reachable from each other. The number of such pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` (or equivalently, unordered pairs `{u, v}`) is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n\nLet the graph have `m` SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. The total number of nodes is `n = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m`.\nThe total number of `p`-reachable pairs is `p = sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2)` for `i = 1 to m`.\nWe want to minimize `n` for a given `p`.\nTo minimize `n`, we should use as few SCCs as possible, and make the `k_i` values as large as possible. This is because `k * (k - 1) / 2` grows quadratically with `k`, while `k` grows linearly. So, a large `k` contributes more to `p` per node.\n\nWe can find the minimum `n` using a greedy approach. Start with `n = 0` and `current_p = 0`. Iterate, adding nodes one by one to the largest possible SCC.\nLet `k` be the current size of the largest SCC we are forming.\n`k = 1`: `1 * 0 / 2 = 0` pairs.\n`k = 2`: `2 * 1 / 2 = 1` pair.\n`k = 3`: `3 * 2 / 2 = 3` pairs.\n`k = 4`: `4 * 3 / 2 = 6` pairs.\n...\n`k = x`: `x * (x - 1) / 2` pairs.\n\nWe want to find the largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`. Let this be `k_max`.\nWe use `k_max` nodes in one SCC. This uses `k_max` nodes and accounts for `k_max * (k_max - 1) / 2` pairs.\nThe remaining `p_rem = p - k_max * (k_max - 1) / 2` pairs need to be formed.\nWe then repeat the process for `p_rem`, finding the largest `k'` such that `k' * (k' - 1) / 2 <= p_rem`, and so on.\nThis greedy strategy works because `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` is convex. To achieve a sum `p` with minimum sum of `k_i`, we should make the `k_i` values as unequal as possible, which means taking the largest possible `k` at each step.\n\nLet's precompute the number of pairs `k * (k - 1) / 2` for `k` from `0` up to a certain limit.\nSince `p <= 2 * 10^5`, `k * (k - 1) / 2` can be at most `2 * 10^5`.\n`k^2 / 2 approx 2 * 10^5 => k^2 approx 4 * 10^5 => k approx sqrt(4 * 10^5) = 2 * 10^2 = 200`.\nSo `k` will not exceed `~633` (since `633 * 632 / 2 = 199698`, `634 * 633 / 2 = 200961`).\nWe can precompute an array `triangular_pairs[k] = k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n\nAlgorithm for minimum `n`:\nInitialize `min_n = 0`.\nWhile `p > 0`:\n  Find the largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`. This can be done by iterating `k` downwards from `~633` or using binary search.\n  Add `k` to `min_n`.\n  Subtract `k * (k - 1) / 2` from `p`.\nReturn `min_n`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nA unidirectional pair `(u, v)` means `u -> v` exists, but `v -> u` does not. This implies `u` and `v` are in different SCCs.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we want to maximize paths between different SCCs.\nConsider the condensation graph (graph of SCCs). This graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\nIf there is an edge from SCC `S_i` to SCC `S_j` in the condensation graph, then for any node `u` in `S_i` and any node `v` in `S_j`, there is a path `u -> v`. Since `S_i` and `S_j` are distinct SCCs, there is no path `v -> u`.\nThus, each such path `u -> v` forms a unidirectional pair.\nIf `S_i` has `k_i` nodes and `S_j` has `k_j` nodes, and there's a path from `S_i` to `S_j` but not vice versa, this contributes `k_i * k_j` unidirectional pairs.\n\nTo maximize these pairs, we should arrange the SCCs in a chain: `S_1 -> S_2 -> ... -> S_m`.\nIn such a chain, for any `i < j`, there is a path from `S_i` to `S_j`. This means for any `u` in `S_i` and `v` in `S_j`, `(u, v)` is a unidirectional pair.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs in this chain structure would be `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} (k_i * k_j)`.\n\nLet `K = [k_1, k_2, ..., k_m]` be the list of SCC sizes determined in Part 1 to achieve minimum `n`.\nThe sum of `k_i` is `n`.\nThe sum of `k_i * k_j` for `i < j` can be calculated as:\n`(sum(k_i))^2 = sum(k_i^2) + 2 * sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)`\nSo, `sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j) = ((sum(k_i))^2 - sum(k_i^2)) / 2`.\nThis value is maximized when the `k_i` values are as spread out as possible.\nOur greedy strategy for minimizing `n` naturally produces `k_i` values that are as spread out as possible (one large `k`, then a smaller `k`, etc.).\nThus, the `k_i` values obtained for minimum `n` are also the optimal `k_i` values for maximizing unidirectional pairs.\n\nAlgorithm for maximum unidirectional pairs:\n1. Re-run the process for finding `min_n`, but store the `k` values in a list `K`.\n   Initialize `K = []`.\n   While `p > 0`:\n     Find the largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= p`.\n     Add `k` to `K`.\n     Subtract `k * (k - 1) / 2` from `p`.\n2. Calculate `sum_k = sum(K)` and `sum_k_sq = sum(k^2 for k in K)`.\n3. The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `(sum_k^2 - sum_k_sq) / 2`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: p = 3**\n1. **Min `n`**:\n   `p = 3`\n   Largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= 3`:\n     `k=1: 0 <= 3`\n     `k=2: 1 <= 3`\n     `k=3: 3 <= 3`\n     `k=4: 6 > 3`\n   So, `k = 3`.\n   `min_n = 3`.\n   `p = 3 - (3 * 2 / 2) = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n   `p` is now `0`, stop.\n   Minimum `n` is `3`.\n   The list of SCC sizes `K = [3]`.\n\n2. **Max unidirectional pairs**:\n   `K = [3]`\n   `sum_k = 3`.\n   `sum_k_sq = 3^2 = 9`.\n   Max unidirectional pairs = `(3^2 - 9) / 2 = (9 - 9) / 2 = 0`.\nOutput: `3 0`. Matches example.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: p = 4**\n1. **Min `n`**:\n   `p = 4`\n   Largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= 4`:\n     `k=1: 0 <= 4`\n     `k=2: 1 <= 4`\n     `k=3: 3 <= 4`\n     `k=4: 6 > 4`\n   So, `k = 3`.\n   `min_n = 3`.\n   `p = 4 - (3 * 2 / 2) = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n   `K = [3]`\n\n   `p = 1`\n   Largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 <= 1`:\n     `k=1: 0 <= 1`\n     `k=2: 1 <= 1`\n     `k=3: 3 > 1`\n   So, `k = 2`.\n   `min_n = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n   `p = 1 - (2 * 1 / 2) = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n   `K = [3, 2]`\n\n   `p` is now `0`, stop.\n   Minimum `n` is `5`.\n   The list of SCC sizes `K = [3, 2]`.\n\n2. **Max unidirectional pairs**:\n   `K = [3, 2]`\n   `sum_k = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n   `sum_k_sq = 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 13`.\n   Max unidirectional pairs = `(5^2 - 13) / 2 = (25 - 13) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6`.\nOutput: `5 6`. Matches example.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: p = 0**\n1. **Min `n`**:\n   `p = 0`\n   `min_n = 0`.\n   `p` is `0`, stop.\n   Minimum `n` is `0`.\n   The list of SCC sizes `K = []`. (Or if `n` must be at least 1, then `k=1` for `p=0` means `n=1`. But `p=0` means no pairs `u<v` are reachable from each other. An empty graph has `n=0` and `p=0`. A graph with 1 node also has `p=0`. The problem asks for minimum nodes required. If `p=0`, we can have `n=0` nodes. If `n=0` is not allowed, then `n=1` is the minimum. However, competitive programming problems usually allow `n=0` for `p=0` if not explicitly stated.) Let's assume `n=0` is valid. If not, `n=1` would be the minimum, and `K=[1]`.\n   If `n=0`, then `K=[]`.\n   If `n=1`, then `K=[1]`. `sum_k=1, sum_k_sq=1`. Unidirectional pairs `(1^2 - 1)/2 = 0`.\n   Output: `0 0` (if `n=0` is allowed for `p=0`). The example output `0 0` confirms `n=0` is allowed for `p=0`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Precompute `triangular_pairs` up to `k=633` (or slightly more to be safe, e.g., 650).\n- When finding the largest `k`, iterate `k` downwards from `max_k` (e.g., 650) to `1`.\n- `p=0` is a special case: `min_n=0`, `max_unidirectional=0`. My algorithm handles this correctly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    p = int(input())\n\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    # Precompute triangular numbers (k * (k - 1) / 2)\n    # Max p is 2 * 10^5.\n    # k * (k - 1) / 2 <= 2 * 10^5\n    # k^2 approx 4 * 10^5\n    # k approx sqrt(4 * 10^5) = 200 * sqrt(10) approx 200 * 3.16 = 632\n    # Let's go up to 650 to be safe.\n    max_k_val = 650\n    triangular_pairs = [0] * (max_k_val + 1)\n    for k in range(1, max_k_val + 1):\n        triangular_pairs[k] = k * (k - 1) // 2\n\n    min_n = 0\n    scc_sizes = [] # Stores the k values for each SCC\n\n    current_p = p\n    while current_p > 0:\n        # Find the largest k such that triangular_pairs[k] <= current_p\n        # We can iterate downwards from max_k_val\n        found_k = 0\n        for k_val in range(max_k_val, 0, -1):\n            if triangular_pairs[k_val] <= current_p:\n                found_k = k_val\n                break\n        \n        # If no k >= 1 is found, it means current_p is 0, which should not happen if loop condition is current_p > 0\n        # Or if current_p is 0, it should exit.\n        # If current_p > 0 but no k_val >= 1 found (meaning current_p < 0), this implies an error in logic or max_k_val too small\n        # For current_p >= 1, k_val = 2 gives 1 pair, so found_k will be at least 2 if current_p >= 1.\n        # If current_p = 0, loop terminates.\n        # If current_p = 1, found_k = 2.\n        # If current_p = 2, found_k = 2.\n        # If current_p = 3, found_k = 3.\n        \n        min_n += found_k\n        scc_sizes.append(found_k)\n        current_p -= triangular_pairs[found_k]\n\n    # Calculate max unidirectional pairs\n    # This is sum_{i < j} (k_i * k_j)\n    # Which equals ((sum k_i)^2 - sum (k_i^2)) / 2\n    \n    sum_k = sum(scc_sizes)\n    sum_k_sq = sum(k * k for k in scc_sizes)\n    \n    max_unidirectional_pairs = (sum_k * sum_k - sum_k_sq) // 2\n\n    print(min_n, max_unidirectional_pairs)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
