The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Frog Jumping and Reachability**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about this Frog Jumping problem. It's about figuring out how many distinct numbers the frog can reach within a certain range.  Essentially, I want a Python script to solve this.\n\nThe problem breaks down like this: the frog can move forward by 'a' or backward by 'b'. There's a constraint, `[0, x]`, so the frog can't jump outside this range. The function `f(x)` is the count of distinct integers reachable starting from 0, given the range `[0, x]`. The ultimate goal is to calculate the sum of `f(i)` for all `i` from 0 to `m`.\n\nFirst, I realize that the frog's reachable positions are a combination of `k*a` jumps forward and `l*b` jumps backward. This forms a set, `k*a - l*b`. Without bounds, the reachable positions are multiples of the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, which is `g`.  This is key. The frog can reach any multiple of `g`.\n\nNow, the `[0, x]` constraint complicates things. I'm thinking about using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to explore the reachable points within the bounds. If a position 'p' is reachable, I can potentially reach `p+a` or `p-b`, as long as they stay within the range.\n\nThe fact that all reachable points are multiples of `g = gcd(a, b)` is central.  I'm imagining dividing both `a` and `b` by `g` to simplify things. So if `a' = a/g` and `b' = b/g`. Then, the frog jumps by `a'` or `-b'`.  Because `gcd(a', b') = 1`, in an unbounded space any integer would be reachable as `k*a' - l*b'`. The real difficulty is with intermediate positions needing to be in `[0, x]`.\n\nI'm starting to think about dynamic programming. I could define `dp[k]` as the minimum number of `+a` jumps needed to reach `k` given only `+a` and `-b` jumps, and where all intermediate jumps are non-negative. This might help to efficiently track reachable states within the bounds.  I'll need to explore this dynamic programming approach further.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i in range(m + 1))`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers a frog can reach starting from `0`, never jumping outside `[0, x]`. The frog can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any position reachable by the frog must be a multiple of `g`.\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum starting position `s` such that `k` is reachable from `s` without going below `0` (i.e., all intermediate positions are in `[0, infinity)`). If `k` is reachable from `0` without going below `0`, then `dp[k]` would be `0`.\nThis is a shortest path problem on a graph where nodes are `0, 1, ..., a+b-1` (or some other range related to `a` and `b`) and edges are `+a` and `-b`. Specifically, we are interested in positions modulo `g`.\n\nA more direct approach for `f(x)`:\nThe set of reachable points within `[0, x]` can be found using a Breadth-First Search (BFS).\nLet `dist[k]` be the minimum value `max_pos` such that `k` is reachable from `0` with all intermediate positions `p` satisfying `0 <= p <= max_pos`.\nWe initialize `dist[0] = 0` and `dist[k] = infinity` for `k != 0`.\nWe use a 0-1 BFS (deque) because `+a` and `-b` jumps have \"cost\" 0 in terms of position, but `+a` potentially increases the maximum position needed.\nThe state in our BFS would be the current position `u`.\nWhen we jump from `u` to `v`:\n1.  `v = u + a`: The new maximum position needed is `max(dist[u], v)`. If `v <= x`, this jump is valid.\n2.  `v = u - b`: The new maximum position needed is `dist[u]`. If `v >= 0`, this jump is valid.\nThe `dist` array will store the minimum `max_pos` to reach `k`.\nThe size of `dist` array needs to be `a+b` (or `a` if we only consider `k mod a`).\nIt's known that all reachable points `k` from `0` without going below `0` are of the form `k*a - l*b`. The smallest positive `k*a - l*b` is `g = gcd(a, b)`.\nThe set of non-negative integers reachable from `0` by jumps `+a` and `-b` (without going below `0`) is `S = {k*a - l*b | k, l >= 0, and all intermediate positions >= 0}`.\nThe crucial insight is that if a position `p` is reachable from `0` without going below `0`, and `p+a` is also reachable without going below `0`, then `p` and `p+a` are \"connected\".\nThe maximum value we need to consider for `dist` array is `a+b-1` (or `a-1`) because of the Frobenius coin problem / extended Euclidean algorithm properties. Any value `k` can be written as `k = q*a + r`, where `r < a`.\nA standard approach uses `dist[k]` as the minimum maximum value reached to get to `k` (modulo `a`).\nLet `dist[r]` be the minimum `max_val` such that `r` is reachable from `0` without going below `0` and `r % a = r`.\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0`, `dist[k] = infinity` for `k \\in [1, a-1]`.\nUse a deque for BFS:\n- Push `(0, 0)` to deque (current position, max_val reached).\n- While deque is not empty:\n    - Pop `(u, max_u)` from front.\n    - If `max_u > dist[u % a]`, continue.\n    - Consider `v = u + a`: `new_max = max(max_u, v)`. If `new_max < dist[v % a]`, update `dist[v % a] = new_max`, push `(v, new_max)` to back of deque.\n    - Consider `v = u - b`: `new_max = max_u`. If `v >= 0` and `new_max < dist[v % a]`, update `dist[v % a] = new_max`, push `(v, new_max)` to front of deque (0-cost edge).\n\nAfter the BFS, `dist[r]` stores the minimum `max_pos` required to reach *any* number `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k >= 0`, without ever dropping below `0`.\nFor a given `x`, `f(x)` is the count of all `k` such that `0 <= k <= x` and `k` is reachable.\n`k` is reachable if `dist[k % a] <= k`. This is because if `dist[k % a]` is the minimum `max_pos` to reach some `k'` where `k' % a = k % a`, then to reach `k` specifically, we must have `k >= dist[k % a]`. (Actually, `k` must be one of the `k'` values, and `max_pos` must be `<= x`).\nThe condition for `k` to be reachable within `[0, x]` is `dist[k % a] <= x`.\nSo, `f(x) = count(k | 0 <= k <= x, dist[k % a] <= x)`.\nThis simplifies to `f(x) = count(k | 0 <= k <= x, dist[k % a] <= k)`. This is because if `dist[k % a] > k`, it means we cannot even reach `k` without exceeding `k` at some point (or going below 0), so it's not reachable within `[0, k]`, thus not within `[0, x]` for `x >= k`. If `dist[k % a] <= k`, then `k` is reachable within `[0, k]`, and thus also within `[0, x]` for `x >= k`.\n\nSo, `f(x) = count(k | 0 <= k <= x, dist[k % a] <= k)`.\nWe need to calculate `S = sum(f(i) for i in range(m + 1))`.\n`S = sum_{i=0 to m} sum_{k=0 to i, dist[k % a] <= k} 1`\n`S = sum_{k=0 to m, dist[k % a] <= k} sum_{i=k to m} 1`\n`S = sum_{k=0 to m, dist[k % a] <= k} (m - k + 1)`\n\nThe `dist` array has size `a`. The BFS takes `O(a * (a/g + b/g))` time, which is `O(a * (a+b)/g)`. Given `a, b <= 10^5`, this is feasible.\nAfter computing `dist`, we iterate `k` from `0` to `m`.\nFor `k` from `0` to `min(m, max_val_in_dist_array + a - 1)` (which is roughly `a+b`):\n  If `dist[k % a] <= k`, add `(m - k + 1)` to sum.\nFor `k` from `max_val_in_dist_array + a` to `m`:\n  For these `k`, `dist[k % a]` will always be less than or equal to `k`. Specifically, for `k >= max(dist)`, the condition `dist[k % a] <= k` will always be true.\n  The maximum value in `dist` is at most `a+b`. So for `k >= a+b`, `dist[k % a] <= k` is always true.\n  So, for `k` from `max_dist_val + 1` to `m`, the condition `dist[k % a] <= k` is always true.\n  Let `K_limit = max(max(dist), a)`. For `k > K_limit`, `dist[k % a] <= k` always holds.\n  The sum can be split:\n  `S = sum_{k=0 to min(m, K_limit)} (m - k + 1) * (1 if dist[k % a] <= k else 0)`\n    `+ sum_{k=min(m, K_limit)+1 to m} (m - k + 1)`\nThe second sum is an arithmetic series: `sum_{j=1 to M} j = M*(M+1)/2`.\nLet `start_k = min(m, K_limit) + 1`.\n`sum_{k=start_k to m} (m - k + 1) = sum_{j=1 to m - start_k + 1} j = (m - start_k + 1) * (m - start_k + 2) / 2`.\nThis allows us to compute the sum efficiently. `K_limit` can be up to `a+b-1`.\nSo the first part is `O(a+b)` and the second part is `O(1)`.\n\nExample walk-through: `m=7, a=5, b=3`.\n`a=5`. `dist` array of size 5.\n`dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\nDeque: `[(0, 0)]`\n1. Pop `(0, 0)`. `u=0, max_u=0`.\n   - `v = 0+5 = 5`. `new_max = max(0, 5) = 5`. `dist[5%5=0] = 0`. `new_max=5` is not `<0`. No update.\n   - `v = 0-3 = -3`. Invalid (`v < 0`).\n2. Pop `(5, 5)` (from previous `u+a` if we were pushing `(v, new_max)` to back). Wait, this is not how 0-1 BFS works. `(v, new_max)` should be pushed to back if `v=u+a` and front if `v=u-b`.\nCorrect 0-1 BFS:\n`dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\nDeque: `[(0, 0)]`\n1. Pop `(0, 0)`. `u=0, max_u=0`.\n   - `v = 0+5 = 5`. `new_max = max(0, 5) = 5`. `dist[5%5=0]` is `0`. `new_max=5` is not `<0`. No update.\n   - `v = 0-3 = -3`. Invalid.\nThis `dist` array definition is problematic. `dist[k % a]` should be the minimum `max_pos` to reach `k` *from `0`*.\n`dist[r]` is the minimum `max_val` such that there exists `k` with `k % a = r`, `k >= 0`, and `k` is reachable from `0` without going below `0`, and the maximum value reached during this path is `max_val`.\n\nLet's use `dist[r]` as the minimum `max_val` to reach a position `p` such that `p % a = r`.\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0`, `dist[k] = infinity` for `k \\in [1, a-1]`.\nDeque: `[(0, 0)]` (current position `p`, max value reached `M`)\n1. Pop `(0, 0)`. `p=0, M=0`.\n   - Jump `+a`: `next_p = 0+5 = 5`. `next_M = max(M, next_p) = max(0, 5) = 5`.\n     `next_p % a = 5 % 5 = 0`. `dist[0]` is `0`. `next_M=5` is not `< dist[0]`. No update.\n   - Jump `-b`: `next_p = 0-3 = -3`. Invalid (`next_p < 0`).\nThe BFS seems to be stuck. This is because `dist[r]` is meant to be the minimum `max_val` to reach `r` *from `0`*, but `r` is just the remainder. The actual position `p` can be larger than `a`.\nThe state in the deque should be `(rem, max_val_to_reach_rem)`.\n`rem` is `p % a`. `max_val_to_reach_rem` is `M`.\n`dist[rem]` stores `M`.\n`dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\nDeque: `[(0, 0)]` (remainder, max_val_reached)\n1.

No update.\nDeque is empty.\nFinal `dist` array: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\nThis means for any `k` from `0` to `a-1`, the minimum `max_val` to reach a position `p` such that `p % a = k` is `0`.\nThis implies `g = gcd(a,b)` must be `1`. If `g > 1`, then `dist` would not be all `0`s for `r` not a multiple of `g`.\nHere `gcd(5,3)=1`. So all remainders are reachable with `max_val=0`. This means all `k` are reachable from `0` without ever going above `0` or below `0` (which is strange, it means all `k` are reachable by only `0` jumps?).\n\nThe `max_val` in `dist[r]` should be the minimum maximum position encountered on a path from `0` to *some* `p` such that `p % a = r` and `p >= 0`.\nLet's re-evaluate the state and transitions:\n`dist[k]` = minimum `max_val` such that `k` is reachable from `0` without going below `0`, and the maximum value encountered on the path is `max_val`.\n`dist` array size `a`. `dist[k]` for `k \\in [0, a-1]`.\n`dist[0] = 0`, others `inf`.\nDeque `Q`: `(pos, max_pos_on_path)`\n`Q.append((0, 0))`\n1.

Invalid.\nThis is still problematic. The issue is that `dist[v%a]` is `dist[0]`.\nThe values in `dist` should be the maximum position reached to get to `k` (modulo `a`).\nFor `a=5, b=3`:\n`dist = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n`Q = deque([(0, 0)])`\n1.

If `new_max < dist[rem]` (`5 < 0`), no.\n     This `+a` jump is always \"costly\" (increase `max_pos`). It should be pushed to the back.\n     If `dist[rem]` was `inf`, we would update `dist[rem]=new_max` and push `(rem, new_max)` to back.\n     But here, `dist[0]=0`, so `5` is not better.\n   - `next_pos = curr_pos - b = -3`. Invalid.\nThis `dist` array is not working for `f(x)`.\n\nLet's use the definition of `dist[k]` from a common solution for this problem:\n`dist[k]` = minimum `max_val` such that `k` is reachable from `0` without going below `0`, and `k` is the final position.\nInitialize `dist[0] = 0`, `dist[k] = infinity` for `k \\in [1, a+b-1]` (or some sufficiently large range, `a` is enough).\n`Q = deque([(0, 0)])`\n`visited = set()`\nWhile `Q`:\n  `curr_pos, max_val = Q.popleft()`\n  If `curr_pos` in `visited`, continue.\n  `visited.add(curr_pos)`\n  `dist[curr_pos] = max_val`\n  `next_pos_plus_a = curr_pos + a`\n  If `next_pos_plus_a < a` (if we consider `dist` up to `a-1`):\n    If `max(max_val, next_pos_plus_a)` is smaller than `dist[next_pos_plus_a]`, update and push to `Q.append()`.\n  `next_pos_minus_b = curr_pos - b`\n  If `next_pos_minus_b >= 0`:\n    If `max_val` is smaller than `dist[next_pos_minus_b]`, update and push to `Q.appendleft()`.\n\nThe `dist[k]` array should be of size `a`. `dist[k]` stores the minimum `max_val` to reach *any* `p` such that `p % a = k`.\n`dist = [inf] * a`\n`dist[0] = 0`\n`Q = deque([(0, 0)])` # (current remainder modulo a, max_val_on_path)\n\nWhile `Q`:\n  `r, M = Q.popleft()`\n  # Option 1: Jump +a\n  # The actual position increases by a.

But `m` is too large.\nWe need to use `k % g` where `g = gcd(a, b)`.\nFor `a=5, b=3`, `g=1`. So `k % 1 = 0` for all `k`.\nThe states are `0, 1, ..., a-1`.\n`dist[k]` is the minimum `max_pos` to reach `k` (modulo `a`). This means it's the minimum `max_pos` to reach *any* `p` such that `p % a = k`.\nLet `dist[k]` be the minimum `P_max` such that `P_max` is the maximum position visited on a path from `0` to some `p` where `p \\equiv k \\pmod a` and `p \\ge 0`.\n`dist = [inf] * a`\n`dist[0] = 0`\n`Q = deque([(0, 0)])` # (current_remainder, max_val_on_path)\n\n1.

The problem is that `M` is `max_val_on_path`, not `current_position`.\nThe actual current position `p` is not directly `M`. `p` could be any value `k` such that `k % a = r` and `k <= M`.\nThe `+a` jump should be `(r, max(M, r+a))` when `r` is the smallest non-negative integer with that remainder.\nThis is the standard state for this type of problem: `(current_node, current_max_value)`.\n`dist[i]` for `i \\in [0, a-1]` is the minimum `max_value` to reach `i` *as the current position*, not `i % a`.\nThis means `dist` should be `[0, m]`. Too big.\n\nLet's rethink `f(x)`. It's the number of reachable integers in `[0, x]`.\n`0` is always reachable.\nIf `k` is reachable, then `k+a` is reachable if `k+a <= x`, and `k-b` is reachable if `k-b >= 0`.\nThis is a standard BFS. The states are `0, 1, ..., x`.\nThe `dist[k]` array would store whether `k` is reachable.\n`dist[k]` is `true` if `k` is reachable, `false` otherwise.\nFor `f(x)`, we run a BFS up to `x`.\n`Q = deque([0])`, `reachable = {0}`.\nWhile `Q`:\n  `curr = Q.popleft()`\n  `next_a = curr + a`\n  If `next_a <= x` and `next_a not in reachable`:\n    `reachable.add(next_a)`\n    `Q.append(next_a)`\n  `next_b = curr - b`\n  If `next_b >= 0` and `next_b not in reachable`:\n    `reachable.add(next_b)`\n    `Q.append(next_b)`\n`f(x) = len(reachable)`.\nThis is `O(x)` for each `f(x)`, total `O(m^2)`. Too slow.\n\nThe crucial insight is that the set of reachable points for `x` will stabilize for `x` large enough.\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. All reachable points are multiples of `g`.\nLet `dp[k]` be the minimum `max_val` such that `k` is reachable from `0` without going below `0` and `k` is the final position.\nThe actual `dp` array should be `dp[k]` for `k \\in [0, a+b-1]` (or `[0, a-1]` if we use modulo `a`).\nLet `dp[r]` be the minimum `M` such that `p \\equiv r \\pmod g` is reachable and `M` is the maximum value on path.\nThis is what the provided solution code implements.\nThe `dist` array is of size `a`. `dist[i]` stores the minimum `max_val` needed to reach *any* point `P` such that `P \\equiv i \\pmod a`.\n`dist = [inf] * a`\n`dist[0] = 0`\n`Q = deque([(0, 0)])` # (remainder, max_val_on_path)\n\nWhile `Q`:\n  `r, M = Q.popleft()`\n  # Jump +a\n  `next_r_plus_a = (r + a) % a`\n  `new_M_plus_a = max(M, r + a)` # This part is key.

Invalid.\nSo, for `x=5`, reachable points are `{0, 2, 5}`. `f(5)=3`.\n\nThe condition for `k` to be reachable within `[0, x]` is `dist[k % a] <= k`.\nLet's check `dist[k % a] <= k` for `k \\in [0, 5]`:\n`dist = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n- `k=0`: `dist[0%5]=0`. `0 <= 0`.

Reachable.\n- `k=4`: `dist[4%5]=0`. `0 <= 4`. True. Reachable.\n- `k=5`: `dist[5%5]=0`. `0 <= 5`. True. Reachable.\nThis logic implies all `k` from `0` to `5` are reachable, so `f(5)=6`. This contradicts the example.\n\nThe `dist[k]` logic is correct for `gcd(a, b) = 1` problems where `dist[k]` is the smallest number `N` such that `N \\equiv k \\pmod a` is reachable without going below `0`. But here it's about `max_val`.\n\nThe problem description's `f(x)` is about *all intermediate positions* must be in `[0, x]`.\nThis means if `k` is a reachable point, and you jump `k+a`, then `k+a` must be `<= x`.\nIf `k` is a reachable point, and you jump `k-b`, then `k-b` must be `>= 0`.\nThis implies that `f(x)` is the number of nodes in the graph `[0, x]` that are reachable from `0`.\nThe `dist[k]` needs to be the minimum `max_pos` value to reach `k` (the actual value `k`).\nThis is Dijkstra on nodes `0` to `max(a, b) + a + b` (some reasonable upper bound).\nLet `MAX_K = a+b+a`.\n`d = [inf] * MAX_K`\n`d[0] = 0`\n`pq = [(0, 0)]` # (max_pos_on_path, current_pos)\n\nWhile `pq`:\n  `max_p, curr_p = heapq.heappop(pq)`\n  If `max_p > d[curr_p]`, continue.\n\n  `next_p_a = curr_p + a`\n  If `next_p_a < MAX_K`:\n    `new_max_a = max(max_p, next_p_a)`\n    If `new_max_a < d[next_p_a]`:\n      `d[next_p_a] = new_max_a`\n      `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_max_a, next_p_a))`\n\n  `next_p_b = curr_p - b`\n  If `next_p_b >= 0`:\n    `new_max_b = max_p`\n    If `new_max_b < d[next_p_b]`:\n      `d[next_p_b] = new_max_b`\n      `heapq.heappush(pq, (new_max_b, next_p_b))`\n\nThis Dijkstra will find `d[k]` = minimum `max_pos` to reach `k`.\nThis `d` array is what we need. The size of `d` should be `a+b` (or `a` if `gcd(a,b)=1`).\nThe maximum value `k` that can be reached and needs to be stored in `d` is `a+b-gcd(a,b)` (Frobenius number).\nSo, `MAX_K = a+b`.\nAfter running this Dijkstra, `d[k]` gives the minimum `max_pos_on_path` to reach `k`.\n`f(x)` is the count of `k` such that `0 <= k <= x` and `d[k] <= x`.\nFor `k >= MAX_K`, `d[k]` will be `inf` if `k` is not reachable. If `k` is reachable, `d[k]` will be some value.\nFor `k >= MAX_K` and `k` reachable, `d[k]` will be `k` itself, or some `k'` where `k' < k`.\nIf `k` is reachable (i.e. `d[k] != inf`), then `k` is counted in `f(x)` if `d[k] <= x`.\nThe maximum value `k` for which `d[k]` is relevant is `m`. But `m` is too large.\nThe `d` array should be computed up to `a+b`.\nFor `k > a+b`, if `k` is reachable, it means `k` is `k_0 + N*g` for some `k_0 < a+b`.\nIf `d[k_0]` is finite, then `d[k_0+g]` is finite, etc.\nThe values `d[k]` for `k > a+b` can be inferred.\nIf `k` is reachable and `k > a+b`, then `d[k]` is `k` itself.\nSo, `f(x) = sum_{k=0 to min(x, a+b)} (1 if d[k] <= x else 0) + sum_{k=a+b+1 to x} (1 if k is reachable else 0)`.\nThe number of reachable points `k > a+b` is `(x - (a+b)) / g` (approximately).\nThe values `d[k]` are computed up to `MAX_K = a+b`.\nThe sum `sum_{i=0 to m} f(i)` becomes:\n`TotalSum = 0`\n`for i in range(m + 1):`\n  `count_reachable = 0`\n  `for k in range(min(i, MAX_K-1) + 1):`\n    `if d[k] <= i:`\n      `count_reachable += 1`\n  `if i >= MAX_K:`\n    `# For k > MAX_K, if k is reachable, d[k] is k.
