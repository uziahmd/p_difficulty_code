Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the TV Game Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"TV Game\" problem, and here's what's going through my mind.  Essentially, we have Homer and Marge competing to maximize the sum of their numbers. The input is a string of digits, and the number of moves `n`. The key insight is that the order of the moves matters.  I need to generate all possible move sequences (HHMM, HMHM, etc.), simulate each sequence, calculate the sum for that sequence, and then output one of the sequences that results in the maximum sum.\n\nThe problem defines that `n` goes up to 18, meaning a total of 36 digits, which is interesting. I'll need to use some efficient techniques to avoid a brute-force approach, but at first I'm thinking of creating all possible moves permutations and simulating them. This probably won't scale if I try all possible permutations.\n\nThe example clarifies the mechanics: the players take digits from the left of the number, append them to their own numbers, and the goal is to maximize the final sum of the numbers they constructed. The example highlights that multiple move sequences can lead to the maximum sum.  For the example where `n` is 2 and the number is \"1234\", I see that both \"HHMM\" and \"MMHH\" give the maximum sum of 46.\n\nSo, I need a Python script to do this. I'll focus on generating the move sequences, simulating the moves, calculating the sum, and finding the maximum sum. This is a permutation-based problem, but I need to think about how to reduce the computational complexity. Perhaps I can optimize the solution later. For now, it's about solving the problem.\n",
