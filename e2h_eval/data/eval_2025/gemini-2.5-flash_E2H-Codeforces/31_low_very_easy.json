Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Vanya and Cards Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for the \"Vanya and Cards\" problem.  Let's break this down. The core is about minimizing the number of cards Vanya needs to add to make the total sum of cards equal to zero. I've got the problem constraints in mind: the number of initial cards (`n`), the maximum absolute value of any card (`x`), and the fact Vanya can get any integer between `-x` and `x`.\n\nFirst, I'll read the input and calculate the `current_sum` of the cards Vanya already has.  Then, I need to figure out the `target_difference`—how much more or less does the sum need to be to reach zero? That's simply the negative of the `current_sum`.\n\nThe key insight is minimizing the *number* of cards. Since Vanya can pick cards with values up to `x` or `-x`, the most efficient way to change the sum is by adding or subtracting multiples of `x`. I'm concerned with the absolute difference, `abs(target_difference)`, because I only care about the magnitude.\n\nIf the absolute difference is zero, no more cards are needed. Otherwise, I need to determine how many cards with the maximum absolute value (`x`) are required.  I'll use the ceiling function (`math.ceil`) or integer division with adjustment to find the minimum number of cards: `ceil(abs(target_difference) / x)`. This ensures that even if there's a remainder, I get enough cards to reach or surpass zero.\n\nI'm thinking about edge cases: if `current_sum` is zero, I need to make sure I don't calculate any further and just return `0`. I'll consider how to handle the integer division.\n\nLet's test this with some examples to make sure I'm on the right track before starting to code.  The example inputs provided confirm this approach. I should be able to write the script pretty quickly now.\n",
