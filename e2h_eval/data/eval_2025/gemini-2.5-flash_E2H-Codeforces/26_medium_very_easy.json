Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my understanding of the problem and the thought process to solve it.**\n\nThe challenge is to count valid triangles given side ranges. We're given that the sides are integers x, y, and z, and they have to fall within the ranges `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, and `C <= z <= D`. The key constraint is the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Since the sides are ordered (implicitly, because `A <= B <= C <= D`), we only need to enforce `x + y > z`.\n\nMy initial thought was to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`, then calculate how many values of `z` would work for each pair. But with the constraints being up to `5 * 10^5`, a naive triple loop (`x`, `y`, `z`) would be too slow (`O(n^3)`). So, a more efficient approach is needed.\n\nI figured that iterating over `x` and `y` first might be helpful, so I started with that, which has complexity `O(n^2)` operations. To calculate the number of valid values for `z`, I realized that we could combine the ranges `C <= z <= D` with the triangle inequality `z < x + y`. This limits the range of z. For each pair of `(x, y)`, the number of valid `z` values would be `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`, which is a constant operation within the inner loop, giving a total complexity of `O(n^2)`.\n\nHowever, the problem description with `O(n^2)` would still be too slow, given the constraints of the test cases! At this point, I needed to rethink the whole process to avoid the inefficiency of the double loops.\n\nI then considered fixing `x`, and iterating on `y`, but this has the same complexity as fixing `y` and iterating on `x`.\n\nSo I then considered iterating through the sum of `x` and `y`, `k=x+y` (going from `A+B` to `B+C`). This reduced the iteration to `O(n)`. The goal then was to determine the number of valid values of `z` given `k` and number of `(x, y)` pairs that sum to `k`. The valid values of `z` would be in the range `[C, min(D, k - 1)]`. The number of `z` values can be computed quickly.\n\nThe more complex part becomes the number of pairs `(x, y)` which sum to `k`. The conditions for these pairs are `A <= x <= B` and `B <= y <= C`. I substituted `y = k - x` which gave me a new range for `x` of `[max(A, k-C), min(B, k-B)]`. Finding the number of `x` values within this range, if any, is constant in the loop. The number of such pairs would be `max(0, min(B, k - B) - max(A, k - C) + 1)`.\n\nBy iterating `k` from `A+B` to `B+C`, calculating the number of valid `z` values, and the number of `(x,y)` pairs, the computation of the result can be done in `O(n)` time, which is fast enough given the constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, and `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's establish the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle with integer sides `x, y, z`. The triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, we can deduce that `x <= y <= z`.\nWith `x <= y <= z`:\n- `x + z > y` is always true because `z >= y` and `x >= A >= 1`.\n- `y + z > x` is always true because `y >= x` and `z >= C >= 1`.\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to explicitly check is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of integer triplets `(x, y, z)` satisfying:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z`\n\nA brute-force approach iterating over all `x`, `y`, `z` would be too slow, as `D` can be up to `5 * 10^5`. This would be `O(B*C*D)` in the worst case, which is `(5*10^5)^3`.\n\nWe can optimize this by iterating over `x` and `y`, and then efficiently counting valid `z`.\nFor fixed `x` and `y`:\n- `z` must satisfy `C <= z <= D`.\n- `z` must satisfy `z < x + y` (or `z <= x + y - 1`).\nCombining these, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of valid `z` values for a fixed `(x, y)` is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nIterating `x` from `A` to `B` and `y` from `B` to `C` would still be `O((B-A+1)(C-B+1))`. In the worst case, this could be `O((5*10^5)^2)`, which is `2.5 * 10^11` operations, still too slow.\n\nLet's try iterating over the sum `k = x + y`.\nThe minimum possible value for `k` is `A + B` (when `x=A, y=B`).\nThe maximum possible value for `k` is `B + C` (when `x=B, y=C`).\nSo, `k` ranges from `A + B` to `B + C`. The maximum value for `B+C` is `5*10^5 + 5*10^5 = 10^6`. This range for `k` is feasible for iteration.\n\nFor each `k` in `[A+B, B+C]`:\n1.  **Count valid `z` values for this `k`**:\n    The conditions for `z` are `C <= z <= D` and `z < k`.\n    So, `z` must be in `[C, min(D, k - 1)]`.\n    Let `max_z_for_k = min(D, k - 1)`.\n    The number of valid `z` values is `count_z = max(0, max_z_for_k - C + 1)`.\n    If `count_z` is 0, no triangles can be formed with this sum `k`, so we can skip this `k`.\n\n2.  **Count valid `(x, y)` pairs such that `x + y = k`**:\n    We need `x + y = k` along with:\n    - `A <= x <= B`\n    - `B <= y <= C`\n    Substitute `y = k - x` into the second set of inequalities:\n    - `B <= k - x  =>  x <= k - B`\n    - `k - x <= C  =>  x >= k - C`\n    Combining all conditions for `x`:\n    `max(A, k - C) <= x <= min(B, k - B)`\n    Let `lower_x = max(A, k - C)` and `upper_x = min(B, k - B)`.\n    The number of valid `x` values (which uniquely determines `y`) is `count_x_y_pairs = max(0, upper_x - lower_x + 1)`.\n    If `count_x_y_pairs` is 0, no `(x, y)` pairs exist for this sum `k`, so we can skip this `k`.\n\n3.  **Add to total**:\n    For a given `k`, each of the `count_x_y_pairs` pairs `(x, y)` can be combined with each of the `count_z` values of `z`. So, we add `count_x_y_pairs * count_z` to our total count.\n\nThe total number of triangles will be the sum of `count_x_y_pairs * count_z` over all valid `k`.\nThis approach iterates `k` from `A+B` to `B+C`, which is at most `10^6` iterations. Inside the loop, we perform a constant number of arithmetic operations. This will be efficient enough.\n\nThe maximum value of `total_triangles` can be large (e.g., if `A=1, B=2.5e5, C=2.5e5, D=5e5`, `k` ranges up to `5e5`, `count_x_y_pairs` can be `2.5e5`, `count_z` can be `2.5e5`, leading to `5e5 * 2.5e5 * 2.5e5` which is too large for a single `k`, but sum over `k` can be `10^6 * 5e5 * 5e5 = 2.5 * 10^17` in a loose upper bound).
