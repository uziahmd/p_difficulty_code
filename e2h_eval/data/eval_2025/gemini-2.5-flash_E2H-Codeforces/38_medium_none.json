    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this competitive programming problem and how I'd approach it.**\n\nMy goal is to figure out the absolute minimum number of nodes (`n`) needed to construct a special kind of directed graph. This graph has to be \"p-reachable,\" which means it must contain exactly `p` pairs of nodes where you can get from one to the other, and back (but only where the first node is smaller than the second). On top of that, I want to find the maximum possible number of \"unidirectional\" pairs within any such graph with that minimum `n` nodes. A unidirectional pair is defined as two different nodes where there's a path from the first to the second, but *not* a path back.\n\nThe term \"reachable from each other\" is crucial. This is equivalent to being in the same strongly connected component (SCC) within the graph. An SCC is a group of nodes where you can get from any node to any other node within that group. In terms of `p`, we're counting the number of unordered pairs of nodes in any SCC, only where the *first* node has a smaller index number than the *second* node.\n\nMy immediate thought is to minimize `n` I need to make the SCCs as large as possible. If I have an SCC with `k` nodes, I get `k * (k - 1) / 2` reachable pairs. This grows quadratically with `k`, but each node only linearly.\n\nThe key is this: I need to use one big SCC to get as close to `p` as possible. So I first, I figure out the largest integer `k` where `k * (k - 1) / 2` is less than or equal to `p`. That will become my large SCC size. If `k * (k - 1) / 2` exactly equals `p`, I can use one large SCC. The value of `n` will just be `k`.\n\nHowever, if `k * (k - 1) / 2` is greater than `p`, then my large SCC has too many reachable pairs. I'll need to use a size slightly smaller than that. In any case, I can find `k` by finding the largest value where `k * (k-1) / 2` is less than or equal to `p`. I know this can be calculated as `floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)`.\n\nIf I can't reach exactly `p` with one SCC, I need to add more. I will have a value `p_rem` which is the number of remaining pairs I need. I want to minimize *new* nodes. It's most efficient to have SCCs of size 2, each contributing one pair. Since each pair needs 2 nodes, I need `2 * p_rem` additional nodes to make these new SCCs.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of nodes `n` can be written as `n = k_max + 2 * p_rem` (where `k_max` is the large SCC I created.\n\nWith a fixed number of nodes, I want to *maximize* the number of unidirectional pairs. To do this, I need to create a linear structure with my SCCs, so all pairs from earlier SCCs to later SCCs are unidirectional.\n\nI can make the final formula for unidirectional pairs as `unidir_pairs = (n * n - sum_k_i_sq) // 2`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values for a given integer `p`:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `n` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. The maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with the minimum `n`.\n\nLet's first understand the definitions:\n- An ordered pair of nodes `(u, v)` is **unidirectional** if `u != v`, there exists a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\n- A directed graph is `p`-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other.\n\nThe condition \"u and v are reachable from each other\" means `u` and `v` belong to the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\nThe condition `u < v` means we are counting unordered pairs of distinct nodes `{u, v}` that are in the same SCC.\nIf an SCC has `k` nodes, it contributes `k * (k - 1) / 2` such pairs.\nIf a graph has SCCs with sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, the total number of `p`-reachable pairs is `sum(k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2)`. The total number of nodes is `n = sum(k_i)`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `n`**\n\nTo minimize `n` for a fixed `p`, we want to make the `k_i` values as large as possible. This is because the function `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2` grows faster than `k`. To get `p` pairs, using fewer larger SCCs generally requires fewer total nodes than many smaller SCCs.\n\nThe optimal strategy to minimize `n` is to use one large SCC and then as many SCCs of size 2 as needed to cover the remainder `p`.\n1. Find the largest integer `k_max` such that `k_max * (k_max - 1) / 2 <= p`.\n   This is equivalent to `k_max^2 - k_max - 2p <= 0`.\n   The roots of `x^2 - x - 2p = 0` are `(1 +/- sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2`.\n   So, `k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8p)) / 2)`.\n   We use `math.isqrt` for integer square root for precision.\n\n2. Calculate the number of pairs contributed by this large SCC: `p_from_k_max = k_max * (k_max - 1) // 2`.\n\n3. Calculate the remaining pairs needed: `p_rem = p - p_from_k_max`.\n   Note that `0 <= p_rem < k_max`. This is because `k_max` is the largest integer satisfying the condition, so `(k_max+1) * k_max / 2 > p`. Thus `p - k_max * (k_max - 1) / 2 < (k_max+1) * k_max / 2 - k_max * (k_max - 1) / 2 = k_max`.\n\n4. To get `p_rem` additional pairs using the minimum number of nodes, we form `p_rem` new SCCs, each of size 2. Each such SCC contributes `2 * (2 - 1) / 2 = 1` pair and uses 2 nodes.\n   So, we need `2 * p_rem` additional nodes.\n\n5. The total minimum number of nodes `n` is `k_max` (from the large SCC) plus `2 * p_rem` (from the small SCCs).\n   `n = k_max + 2 * p_rem`.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs**\n\nWe have determined the set of SCCs: one SCC of size `k_max` and `p_rem` SCCs of size 2. Let `m = 1 + p_rem` be the total number of SCCs.\nLet the sizes of these SCCs be `s_1, s_2, ..., s_m`.\nThe total number of nodes `n = sum(s_i)` is fixed.\n\nA pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u` and `v` are in different SCCs, and there's a path from `u`'s SCC to `v`'s SCC, but no path from `v`'s SCC to `u`'s SCC.\nTo maximize such pairs, we should arrange the SCCs in a linear chain (a total order) in the condensation graph. For example, `C_1 -> C_2 -> ... -> C_m`.\nIn this arrangement, for any `i < j`, there is a path from `C_i` to `C_j`, but no path from `C_j` to `C_i`.\nThus, all `s_i * s_j` pairs `(u, v)` where `u` is in `C_i` and `v` is in `C_j` (for `i < j`) are unidirectional.\nThe total number of unidirectional pairs is `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} s_i * s_j`.\n\nThis sum can be calculated using the identity:\n`(sum_{i=1}^m s_i)^2 = sum_{i=1}^m s_i^2 + 2 * sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} s_i * s_j`.\nSo, `sum_{1 <= i < j <= m} s_i * s_j = ( (sum s_i)^2 - sum s_i^2 ) / 2`.\nWe know `sum s_i = n`.\nThe sum of squares of SCC sizes is `sum_s_i_sq = k_max^2 + p_rem * 2^2 = k_max^2 + 4 * p_rem`.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is `(n * n - sum_s_i_sq) // 2`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (p=4):**\n1. `p = 4`.\n2. `k_max = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*4)) / 2) = floor((1 + sqrt(33)) / 2)`.\n   `sqrt(33)` is approximately 5.74.\n   `k_max = floor((1 + 5.74) / 2) = floor(3.37) = 3`.\n3. `p_from_k_max = 3 * (3 - 1) // 2 = 3 * 2 // 2 = 3`.\n4. `p_rem = p - p_from_k_max = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n5. Minimum nodes `n = k_max + 2 * p_rem = 3 + 2 * 1 = 5`.\n6. SCC sizes are `k_max = 3` and `p_rem = 1` SCC of size 2. So, SCCs are of sizes 3 and 2.\n   `sum_s_i_sq = 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 13`.\n7. Maximum unidirectional pairs = `(n * n - sum_s_i_sq) // 2 = (5 * 5 - 13) // 2 = (25 - 13) // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6`.\n\nOutput: `5 6`.
