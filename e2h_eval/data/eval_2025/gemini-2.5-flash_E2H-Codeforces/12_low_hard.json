The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Xenia and the Ringroad: Crafting an Optimal Solution**\n\nOkay, so I need to whip up a Python script to tackle this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's see... First, the problem definition: we have `n` houses in a circle, numbered 1 to `n`, and `m` tasks. Each task `i` requires Xenia to be at house `a_i`.  She starts at house 1, and can only move clockwise. The time to move between neighboring houses is one unit. The goal is to minimize the total time to complete all tasks in order.\n\nAlright, the core logic should revolve around tracing her movements. I'll start with `current_house = 1`. For each task `a_i`, I'll need to calculate the time it takes to get from `current_house` to `a_i`.  Since movement is clockwise only, the distance calculation is key.\n\nIf `a_i` is greater than or equal to `current_house`, the distance is straightforward: `a_i - current_house`.  However, if `a_i` is less than `current_house`, she's gone all the way around the ring. The correct time calculation would be  `(n - current_house) + a_i`, which accounts for the wrap-around.\n\nI could use the modulo operator, like `(a_i - current_house + n) % n` to handle this. It elegantly covers both scenarios. But for clarity, let's keep it simple.\n\nMy strategy will involve these steps:\n\n1.  Initialize `total_time = 0` and `current_house = 1`.\n2.  Iterate through the tasks `a_i`:\n    *   Calculate the time `time_taken` to move from `current_house` to `a_i`.\n        *   If `a_i >= current_house`, then `time_taken = a_i - current_house`.\n        *   Otherwise, `time_taken = n - current_house + a_i`.\n    *   Add `time_taken` to `total_time`.\n    *   Update `current_house = a_i`.\n3.  Return `total_time`.\n\nI need to make sure I test the solution thoroughly, especially the edge cases like when the target house wraps around. The examples given in the prompt, along with some added tests, should be sufficient to validate the script's accuracy. Now, let's turn this logic into Python code.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the minimum time Xenia needs to complete a series of tasks. Xenia starts at house 1. There are `n` houses on a ringroad, numbered 1 to `n` clockwise. Movement is only clockwise, and moving to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time. She has `m` tasks, specified by a sequence of target houses `a_1, a_2, ..., a_m`. She must complete task `i` at house `a_i` only after all tasks `j < i` are completed.\n\nLet's track Xenia's current position and the total time elapsed.\nInitially:\n- `current_house = 1`\n- `total_time = 0`\n\nWe process the tasks one by one in the given order `a_1, a_2, ..., a_m`. For each task `i` that requires Xenia to be at house `a_i`:\n\n1.  **Determine the target house:** Let `target_house = a_i`.\n2.  **Calculate time to move:** Xenia needs to move from `current_house` to `target_house` in a clockwise direction.\n    *   If `target_house >= current_house`: She moves directly clockwise. The time taken is `target_house - current_house`.\n    *   If `target_house < current_house`: She has to pass house `n` and then continue to `target_house`. The time taken is `(n - current_house) + target_house`.\n3.  **Update total time:** Add the calculated time to `total_time`.\n4.  **Update current house:** Set `current_house = target_house` for the next task.\n\nAfter processing all `m` tasks, `total_time` will hold the minimum time required.\n\nLet's trace the first example: `n = 4, m = 3`, tasks `a = [3, 2, 3]`\n\n*   **Initial state:** `current_house = 1`, `total_time = 0`\n\n*   **Task 1 (target `a_1 = 3`):**\n    *   `target_house = 3`, `current_house = 1`.\n    *   `target_house >= current_house` (3 >= 1).\n    *   Time taken = `3 - 1 = 2`.\n    *   `total_time = 0 + 2 = 2`.\n    *   `current_house = 3`.\n    *   (Moves: 1 -> 2 -> 3)\n\n*   **Task 2 (target `a_2 = 2`):**\n    *   `target_house = 2`, `current_house = 3`.\n    *   `target_house < current_house` (2 < 3).\n    *   Time taken = `(n - current_house) + target_house = (4 - 3) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n    *   `total_time = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n    *   `current_house = 2`.\n    *   (Moves: 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2)\n\n*   **Task 3 (target `a_3 = 3`):**\n    *   `target_house = 3`, `current_house = 2`.\n    *   `target_house >= current_house` (3 >= 2).\n    *   Time taken = `3 - 2 = 1`.\n    *   `total_time = 5 + 1 = 6`.\n    *   `current_house = 3`.\n    *   (Moves: 2 -> 3)\n\n*   **All tasks completed.** Final `total_time = 6`.\n\nThis approach correctly handles all cases and is efficient enough, as it iterates through the `m` tasks once. The time complexity will be O(m).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    current_house = 1\n    total_time = 0\n\n    for target_house in a:\n        if target_house >= current_house:\n            # Move clockwise directly\n            time_taken = target_house - current_house\n        else:\n            # Move clockwise, passing house 'n' and wrapping around\n            time_taken = (n - current_house) + target_house\n        \n        total_time += time_taken\n        current_house = target_house\n    \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
