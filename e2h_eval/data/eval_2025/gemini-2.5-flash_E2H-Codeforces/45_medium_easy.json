There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Tennis Tournament Game Maximization**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. We've got this \"Tennis Championship\" problem, and I need to figure out the most games the winner can possibly play in this knockout tournament. The key rule is that players can only face off if their game counts differ by at most one.\n\nMy approach is to model this as a Fibonacci sequence, which seems to arise naturally. If a player wins `k` games, we need to know the *minimum* number of players required for that scenario. Let's call that `F(k)`.\n\nBase cases are easy: `F(0) = 1` (a single player who hasn't played), and `F(1) = 2` (one player with one win, another who hasn't played yet). Now the fun part: let's say the winner has `k` wins. They've just beaten someone in their `k`-th game.\n\nFor a winner with `k` wins, we have two likely opponents: one who has won `k-1` or `k-2` games previously. The goal is to minimize the total number of players. Because of the rules, the winner's deepest possible opponent is at most one less. And if we want to minimize the total number of players required, we'll pick the opponents that minimize the previous games won, so we're building the minimal tree structure.\n\nIt turns out that `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)`.  That looks exactly like the Fibonacci sequence! We now can express `F(k)` as `Fib(k+2)`. I just have to find the biggest `k` where `Fib(k+2)` is still less than or equal to `n`, our total number of players.\n\nI will iterate through the Fibonacci numbers, keeping track of the current number and the previous one.  As soon as the next Fibonacci number is bigger than our number of players, I will return the games `k` for the last number, so `k = current - 1`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` participants and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games to continue.\n\nLet `F(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `k` games, following the given rule. We want to find the largest `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's establish the base cases for `F(k)`:\n- `F(0)`: A player who hasn't played any games yet. This requires 1 player. So, `F(0) = 1`.\n- `F(1)`: A player wins 1 game. To do this, they (having played 0 games) must play against an opponent who has also played 0 games (satisfying `abs(0 - 0) <= 1`). This requires one player who will become the winner (`F(0)`) and one opponent (`F(0)`). So, `F(1) = F(0) + F(0) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\nNow, consider `F(k)` for `k >= 2`:\nTo produce a winner who has played `k` games, this player (let's call them `W`) must have already won `k-1` games. `W` then plays their `k`-th game against an opponent (let's call them `O`).\nAccording to the rule, if `W` has played `k-1` games, `O` must have played `j` games such that `abs((k-1) - j) <= 1`. This means `j` can be `k-2` or `k-1`.\n\nTo minimize the total number of players `F(k)`, we should choose the opponent `O` such that the number of players required for `O`'s sub-tournament (`F(j)`) is minimized.\n- Option 1: `O` has played `k-2` games. This requires `F(k-2)` players for `O`'s sub-tournament.\n  Total players: `F(k-1)` (for `W`) + `F(k-2)` (for `O`).\n- Option 2: `O` has played `k-1` games. This requires `F(k-1)` players for `O`'s sub-tournament.\n  Total players: `F(k-1)` (for `W`) + `F(k-1)` (for `O`).\n\nSince `F(x)` is a non-decreasing sequence (more games generally require more players), `F(k-2)` will always be less than or equal to `F(k-1)`. Therefore, to minimize `F(k)`, we always choose Option 1 (if `k-2 >= 0`).\nThis leads to the recurrence relation: `F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\nLet's list the sequence:\n- `F(0) = 1`\n- `F(1) = 2`\n- `F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`\n- `F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`\n- `F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`\nThis sequence `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...` perfectly matches the Fibonacci sequence, but with a shifted index. If we define `Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, ...`, then `F(k) = Fib(k+2)`.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` such that `F(k) <= n`. This means we need to find the largest `k` such that `Fib(k+2) <= n`.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we cannot precompute all Fibonacci numbers. However, Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. `Fib(k)` is approximately `phi^k / sqrt(5)`, where `phi` is the golden ratio (approx 1.618). For `n = 10^18`, `k` will be relatively small (around 85-90). We can iteratively calculate Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `f_prev = 1` (representing `F(0)` or `Fib(2)`).\n2. Initialize `f_curr = 2` (representing `F(1)` or `Fib(3)`).\n3. Initialize `max_games_winner = 1` (this is the number of games for a winner when `f_curr` players are available).\n4. While `f_curr <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `f_next = f_prev + f_curr`.\n   b. Update `f_prev` to `f_curr`.\n   c. Update `f_curr` to `f_next`.\n   d. Increment `max_games_winner` (because `f_curr` now represents the minimum players for a winner with one more game).\n5. When the loop terminates, `f_curr` is the first value in the `F` sequence that is greater than `n`. The `max_games_winner` variable at this point corresponds to this `f_curr`. Therefore, the maximum number of games a winner can play with `n` players is `max_games_winner - 1`.\n\nExample with `n = 10`:\n- Initial: `f_prev = 1`, `f_curr = 2`, `max_games_winner = 1`.\n- `2 <= 10` (True): `f_next = 1+2=3`, `f_prev = 2`, `f_curr = 3`, `max_games_winner = 2`.\n- `3 <= 10` (True): `f_next = 2+3=5`, `f_prev = 3`, `f_curr = 5`, `max_games_winner = 3`.\n- `5 <= 10` (True): `f_next = 3+5=8`, `f_prev = 5`, `f_curr = 8`, `max_games_winner = 4`.\n- `8 <= 10` (True): `f_next = 5+8=13`, `f_prev = 8`, `f_curr = 13`, `max_games_winner = 5`.\n- `13 <= 10` (False): Loop terminates.\n- Result: `max_games_winner - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n\nThis approach is efficient enough for `n` up to `10^18` because Python's integers handle arbitrary size, and the number of iterations is small.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # F(k) represents the minimum number of players required to produce a winner\n    # who has played exactly k games, following the tournament rule.\n    # The sequence F(k) follows the Fibonacci pattern:\n    # F(0) = 1 (1 player, 0 games played)\n    # F(1) = 2 (winner played 0 games, opponent played 0 games, they play; total 2 players)\n    # For k >= 2, F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2).\n    # This is because to minimize players, the winner (who has played k-1 games)\n    # should play against an opponent who has played k-2 games (as per the rule\n    # |(k-1) - (k-2)| <= 1, and F(k-2) is smaller than F(k-1)).\n    \n    # We are looking for the maximum k such that F(k) <= n.\n\n    # Initialize f_prev and f_curr to represent F(0) and F(1) respectively.\n    # f_prev corresponds to F(k-1) in the general recurrence.\n    # f_curr corresponds to F(k) in the general recurrence.\n    f_prev = 1  # F(0) = 1 player\n    f_curr = 2  # F(1) = 2 players\n\n    # max_games_winner tracks the number of games played by the winner for the current f_curr.\n    # If f_curr = 2 (F(1)), the winner plays 1 game.\n    max_games_winner = 1 \n\n    # Iterate, generating Fibonacci numbers (F(k) values) until f_curr exceeds n.\n    while f_curr <= n:\n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number in the sequence.\n        f_next = f_prev + f_curr\n        \n        # Shift the values for the next iteration:\n        # The current f_curr becomes the previous one.\n        f_prev = f_curr\n        # The newly calculated f_next becomes the current one.\n        f_curr = f_next\n        \n        # Each time f_curr is updated to a new F(k) value, it means a winner\n        # can play one more game.
