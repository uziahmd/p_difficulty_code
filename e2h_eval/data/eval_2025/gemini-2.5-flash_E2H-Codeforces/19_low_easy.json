The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Approach to the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem and I immediately recognize a few key things. First, the problem description screams \"tree structure\" at me. The districts and roads forming a tree is a crucial detail. I need to figure out how to leverage that. Then there's this fan count: each district has a contestant with `2^i` fans. This power of two structure is a huge clue about how the solution will work. I'm thinking, I need to write a Python script that reads the input, does some calculations, and spits out the output.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the *remaining* fans after removing some contestants, with a connectivity constraint. This means the districts I keep must form a connected subgraph, a subtree within the original tree.  This translates to minimizing the sum of fans for those *removed* districts.\n\nSince the number of fans grows exponentially with the district number, the greedy approach feels right. To maximize the kept fans, I should keep the districts with the largest indices. That's where the most \"bang for my buck\" is, fan-wise.  The real challenge is balancing that greed with the connectivity requirement. I can't just pick the `n-k` largest districts because they might not be connected.\n\nMy intuition says: I'll start with the largest districts (the high indices) and work my way down. District *n* is a must-keep if possible, given that it offers the maximum number of fans. Then I'll check district *n-1* and see if it's connected to *n* somehow. If it is, great! If not, I will need to remove *n-1*. Then I continue this process, in decreasing order of districts until I get to the total of *n-k* districts.  I'm basically selecting a subtree with the largest possible values for the indices while guaranteeing connectivity. The output, then, will just be the districts I *didn't* include.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n-k` districts such that they form a connected subgraph (a subtree, since the original graph is a tree) and the sum of fans of their contestants is maximized. The number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`.\n\nTo maximize the sum `sum(2^i)`, we should prioritize keeping districts with larger indices, as `2^i` grows very rapidly. For instance, `2^i` is always greater than the sum of all `2^j` for `j < i`. This means `2^N` is greater than `2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^(N-1)`. This property implies a strong greedy strategy: we want to keep the largest possible district indices.\n\nLet's consider the districts in decreasing order of their indices: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `N_kept = n-k` districts.\nThe district `n` offers the most fans. It is always optimal to keep district `n` if possible, because its fan count `2^n` is larger than the sum of all other possible fan counts `2^1 + ... + 2^(n-1)`. If we don't keep `n`, we would need to keep all other `n-1` districts to get a sum that is still less than `2^n`. Since we only keep `n-k` districts, and `k >= 1`, we can't keep all `n-1` districts. Thus, we must keep district `n`.\n\nOnce we decide to keep district `n`, we need to select `N_kept - 1` more districts such that they form a connected component with `n`. This means all selected districts must be reachable from `n` without passing through any *removed* districts.\n\nThis problem can be rephrased as: we want to remove `k` districts such that the remaining `n-k` districts form a connected component, and the sum of fans of the *removed* districts is minimized. To minimize the sum of `2^i` for removed districts, we should remove districts with the smallest indices.\n\nCombining these ideas: we want to keep districts with large indices, and we must maintain connectivity. The most \"valuable\" district is `n`. The next most valuable is `n-1`, and so on.\nLet's try to keep district `n`, then `n-1`, then `n-2`, and so on, as long as we can maintain connectivity and haven't selected `n-k` districts.\n\nConsider the districts in decreasing order: `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts.\nWe start by marking district `n` as \"kept\". We have 1 district kept.\nThen, we iterate from `i = n-1` down to `1`. For each district `i`:\nIf we have already kept `n-k` districts, we stop.\nOtherwise, we check if district `i` can be added to our set of kept districts while maintaining connectivity.\nThis means district `i` must be adjacent to at least one district already in our \"kept\" set, OR it must be adjacent to a district `j` which is adjacent to a district `l` already in our \"kept\" set, and so on. In other words, `i` must be reachable from the current \"kept\" component using only districts that are *not* yet marked for removal.\n\nThis suggests a Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) approach.\nLet's start a traversal (e.g., BFS) from district `n`. We keep `n`.\nWe then explore its neighbors. For each neighbor `v`, we can potentially keep `v`.\nThe crucial insight is that we want to keep the *largest possible indices*. So, if we are exploring from `u` and `v` is a neighbor, we prefer to keep `v` if `v` has a larger index than other unvisited neighbors.\n\nThis is exactly what a standard BFS/DFS does if we process neighbors in a specific order. However, a simpler way to think about it is:\n1.  Initialize a set `kept_districts` with `n`.\n2.  Initialize a `removed_districts` list (which will be our answer).\n3.  We need to keep `n-k` districts. We have kept 1 so far.\n4.  We will iterate through districts `i` from `n-1` down to `1`.\n    For each `i`:\n    If we have already kept `n-k` districts, then all remaining districts `1, ..., i` must be removed. Add them to `removed_districts` and break.\n    Otherwise, we check if district `i` is \"reachable\" from the current `kept_districts` component without passing through any districts that are *definitely going to be removed*.\n    The districts that are definitely going to be removed are those with small indices that are not part of the `n-k` kept districts.\n\nThe strategy of prioritizing larger indices naturally leads to a \"pruning\" process.\nStart a traversal (e.g., BFS) from district `n`.\nWe want to find `n-k` districts.\nLet `q` be a queue for BFS. Add `n` to `q`.\nLet `kept_count = 0`.\nLet `visited` array keep track of districts we have decided to keep.\nWhen we pop `u` from `q`:\n  If `kept_count == n-k`, we stop.\n  Mark `u` as `kept`. Increment `kept_count`.\n  Add all unvisited neighbors `v` of `u` to `q`.\nThis simple BFS will find `n-k` districts that form a connected component starting from `n`. Which `n-k` districts will it find? It will find `n` and then its neighbors, then their neighbors, and so on, filling up `n-k` spots. This doesn't guarantee maximizing the sum `2^i` because it doesn't prioritize larger indices among neighbors.\n\n**Correct Approach (Greedy BFS/DFS):**\nWe want to keep `n-k` districts. We must keep `n`.\nLet `kept_count = 1`.\nLet `kept_set` be a boolean array, `kept_set[i] = True` if district `i` is kept. Initialize `kept_set[n] = True`.\nWe need to find `k` districts to remove.\nThe districts that are *not* kept by the end are removed.\n\nConsider a modified BFS:\n1.  Initialize a queue `q` and add district `n`.\n2.  Initialize `is_kept` array (or set) to `False` for all districts. Set `is_kept[n] = True`.\n3.  Initialize `num_kept_nodes = 1`.\n4.  While `q` is not empty and `num_kept_nodes < n - k`:\n    a.  Dequeue a district `u`.\n    b.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        i.  If `v` is not marked as `is_kept`:\n            Mark `v` as `is_kept[v] = True`.\n            Enqueue `v`.\n            Increment `num_kept_nodes`.\n            If `num_kept_nodes == n - k`, break the inner loop (over neighbors) and the outer loop (while q is not empty).\n\nThis standard BFS will find `n-k` nodes closest to `n` in terms of path length. This is not what we want. We want nodes with *largest indices*.\n\nThe key is that we want to remove the *smallest possible indices* that are *not necessary* for connectivity.\nThis implies we should remove nodes `1, 2, 3, ...` as long as their removal doesn't disconnect the component containing `n` and the other large-indexed nodes we want to keep.\n\nLet's use a `parent` array to reconstruct paths in the tree. Perform a DFS/BFS from an arbitrary root (say, district 1) to build the parent pointers. This isn't strictly necessary for a tree, but can be useful.\n\nA more direct approach:\n1.  Initialize `kept_count = 0`.\n2.  Initialize `is_removed` array to `False` for all districts.\n3.  Iterate `i` from `n` down to `1`:\n    a.  If `is_removed[i]` is `False`: (i.e., we haven't decided to remove `i` yet)\n        Increment `kept_count`.\n        If `kept_count == n - k`:\n            We have found our `n-k` districts. All other districts (those with smaller indices than `i`, and those marked `is_removed`) will be removed.\n            Break the loop.\n    b.  If `is_removed[i]` is `True`: (i.e., we already decided to remove `i`)\n        Do nothing, `kept_count` doesn't change.\n\nThis doesn't account for connectivity. The core idea is that if we keep `n-k` nodes, they must form a connected component. This means there must be a path between any two kept nodes that only uses other kept nodes.\n\nConsider the $k$ districts to remove. To minimize `sum(2^i for i in Removed)`, we should remove districts with the smallest indices.\nLet's try removing districts `1, 2, ..., k`. This only works if `n, n-1, ..., k+1` form a connected component. This is generally not true.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding a subtree of size `n-k` that maximizes `sum(2^i)`.\nSince `2^i` is so dominant, we want to keep `n` and `n-1`, etc.\nThis suggests a greedy strategy:\n1.  Start with `n` as the only kept node. `kept_nodes = {n}`.\n2.  We need to keep `n-k` nodes. We have `1` node.\n3.  We want to add `n-k-1` more nodes, prioritizing those with largest indices.\n4.  Consider a \"frontier\" of nodes connected to `kept_nodes` but not yet kept.\n    This frontier is the set of neighbors of `kept_nodes` that are not themselves `kept_nodes`.\n5.  From this frontier, always pick the node with the largest index. Add it to `kept_nodes`. Repeat until `n-k` nodes are kept.\n\nLet's refine this greedy strategy:\n1.  Build adjacency list for the tree.\n2.  Initialize `kept = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n3.  Initialize `num_kept = 0`.\n4.  Initialize a priority queue (max-heap) `pq`. This `pq` will store nodes that are candidates to be kept.\n5.  Add `n` to `pq`. (`pq` will store `(node_id)`).\n6.  While `num_kept < n - k` and `pq` is not empty:\n    a.  Extract the node `u` with the largest index from `pq`.\n    b.  If `kept[u]` is already `True`, continue (this can happen if `u` was added to `pq` multiple times by different neighbors before being processed).\n    c.  Mark `kept[u] = True`.\n    d.  Increment `num_kept`.\n    e.  For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n        If `kept[v]` is `False`:\n            Add `v` to `pq`. (Note: `v` might already be in `pq` if it's a neighbor of another kept node. A `set` for `pq` or checking for `kept[v]` when adding to `pq` would be more efficient to avoid duplicates, but a simple list + sort or `heapq` with `kept` check works.)\n\nAfter this loop, all nodes `i` for which `kept[i]` is `False` are the ones to be removed.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `n=6, k=3`. We need to keep `6-3=3` nodes.\nEdges: (2,1), (2,6), (4,2), (5,6), (2,3)\nAdj:\n1: [2]\n2: [1,6,4,3]\n3: [2]\n4: [2]\n5: [6]\n6: [2,5]\n\n1.  `kept = [F,F,F,F,F,F,F]` (index 0 unused)\n2.  `num_kept = 0`\n3.  `pq = []` (max-heap)\n4.  Add `6` to `pq`. `pq = [6]`.\n5.  Loop: `num_kept < 3` and `pq` not empty.\n    a.  Extract `u = 6`.\n    b.  `kept[6]` is `False`.\n    c.  `kept[6] = True`. `num_kept = 1`.\n    d.  Neighbors of `6`: `2, 5`.\n        `v=2`: `kept[2]` is `False`. Add `2` to `pq`. `pq = [2]`.\n        `v=5`: `kept[5]` is `False`. Add `5` to `pq`. `pq = [2,5]`.\n        (Note: `pq` should be `[6]` initially, then `[5,2]` after processing `6` and adding `2,5`. Max-heap logic)\n        Let's use a `set` to track candidates and a `list` to sort: `candidates = {2,5}`.\n        (Or, if using `heapq`, it's a min-heap, so store negative values: `pq = [-6]`. Pop `-6`, `u=6`. Add `-2,-5`. `pq = [-5,-2]`).\n        Let's stick to max-heap conceptual: `pq = [5,2]` (nodes sorted by value).\n\n6.  Loop: `num_kept = 1 < 3`. `pq = [5,2]`.\n    a.  Extract `u = 5`.\n    b.  `kept[5]` is `False`.\n    c.  `kept[5] = True`. `num_kept = 2`.\n    d.  Neighbors of `5`: `6`.\n        `v=6`: `kept[6]` is `True`. Do nothing.\n    `pq = [2]`.\n\n7.  Loop: `num_kept = 2 < 3`. `pq = [2]`.\n    a.  Extract `u = 2`.\n    b.  `kept[2]` is `False`.\n    c.  `kept[2] = True`. `num_kept = 3`.\n    d.  Neighbors of `2`: `1,6,4,3`.\n        `v=1`: `kept[1]` is `False`. Add `1` to `pq`. `pq = [1]`.\n        `v=6`: `kept[6]` is `True`. Do nothing.\n        `v=4`: `kept[4]` is `False`. Add `4` to `pq`. `pq = [4,1]`.\n        `v=3`: `kept[3]` is `False`. Add `3` to `pq`. `pq = [4,3,1]`.\n\n8.  Loop: `num_kept = 3`. Condition `num_kept < n-k` is `False`. Loop terminates.\n\nFinal `kept` array: `kept[6]=T, kept[5]=T, kept[2]=T`. All others `False`.\nRemoved districts are those with `kept[i]=False`: `1, 3, 4`.\nOutput: `1 3 4`. This matches the example!\n\nThis greedy strategy seems correct. It always extends the connected component with the largest available node index. Since `2^i` is so dominant, this is optimal.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n*   Adjacency list: `adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]`.\n*   `kept` array: `kept = [False] * (n + 1)`.\n*   Priority queue: Python's `heapq` is a min-heap. To simulate a max-heap, store negative values: `heapq.heappush(pq, -node_id)`, `node_id = -heapq.heappop(pq)`.\n*   `n` up to `10^6`, so `O(N log N)` or `O(N)` is required. Building adjacency list is `O(N)`. The loop runs `N-K` times. Each time, `heapq.heappop` is `O(log N)`. Adding neighbors: in total, each edge is processed twice, so `2*(N-1)` pushes to `pq`, each `O(log N)`. Total complexity: `O(N log N)`. This should be fine for `N=10^6`.\n\nLet's consider `N=10^6, K=1`. We keep `10^6-1` nodes.\nThe loop `num_kept < n-k` will run `n-k` times.\nIn total, there are `N-1` edges. Each edge `(u,v)` leads to `v` being added to `pq` when `u` is processed, and `u` being added when `v` is processed. So at most `2*(N-1)` pushes to `pq`.\nEach push and pop is `O(log SizeOfPQ)`. Max size of `pq` is `N`.
