            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving this base conversion problem:**\n\nFirst, I need to read the input: the source base (`a`), the target base (either an integer `b` or 'R' for Roman numerals), and the number `c` in base `a`. I can handle this with `input().split()` and `int()`.\n\nNext, I'll convert the number `c` from base `a` to decimal (base 10). I'll write a function `to_decimal(num_str, base)` for this, which needs to handle digits greater than 9 (A=10, B=11, etc.).\n\nThen, I need to convert the decimal number to the target base.\n*   If the target base is an integer `b`, I'll use a function `from_decimal(num, base)`. It'll build the result string from right to left, ensuring no leading zeros.\n*   If the target is 'R' (Roman numerals), I'll use a function `to_roman(num)`. I'll use the standard Roman numeral rules, including the subtractive principle (IV, IX, etc.).  The largest number I need to handle is 3000. I can use a greedy approach with a lookup table of Roman numeral values and symbols, sorted in descending order. The problem states that zero is not a valid input if 'R' is provided.\n\nFor both base conversion and Roman numerals, leading zeros should be omitted. My `from_decimal` function naturally handles this.  My `to_roman` should also avoid this case.\n\nI need to make sure my functions work correctly and efficiently.  Python's arbitrary-precision integers will handle potentially large numbers without issue. The problem specifies bases up to 25 and input length up to 10^3, which should be within reasonable bounds.  I've detailed each part and included example test cases within the thought process. I'm also ensuring the roman numeral function handles 0 and other edge cases. I'll need to double-check that this is efficient.\n\nI've tested the functions and logic flow to ensure it matches the example inputs and outputs in the problem description, confirming that no test conditions will be missed. I'm accounting for the problem statement details and constraints at each step of the conversion. It's time to put it all together.\n",
