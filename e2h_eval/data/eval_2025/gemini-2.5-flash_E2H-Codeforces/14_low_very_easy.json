He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Trailing Zeroes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to find all `n` such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.  The input `m` can be up to 100,000.  The output needs to include both the *count* of such `n`s and the `n`s themselves, in ascending order.  First things first, I need to understand this problem.\n\n**Understanding the Core Concept**\n\nThe key here is that trailing zeroes are determined by the number of factors of 10 in `n!`. Since 10 is 2 * 5, and there will *always* be more factors of 2 than 5, I just need to count the factors of 5. Legendre's formula gives me a way to do this: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`, where `Z(n)` is the number of trailing zeroes.\n\n**Analyzing the Z(n) Function**\n\nNow, `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. It only changes when `n` is a multiple of 5, and it doesn't always increase.  This is important.  If `n` isn't a multiple of 5, then `Z(n)` is the same as `Z(n-1)`.  For example, `Z(5)` is 1, but `Z(6)` through `Z(9)` are *also* 1. If `n` is a multiple of 5 it *may* increase.\nI am seeing that, I can use binary search but it would be far better to look at examples and work it out in a linear fashion.\n\n**Finding the Ns**\n\nI'm looking for all `n` where `Z(n) = m`. Since `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, I could use binary search, but the problem asks for *all* such `n`s. This gives me a better intuition for a linear approach. The value of `Z(n)` will change and stabilize for a short while at integer values, so I'll need to figure out the boundaries.\n\nFor a fixed `m`, if I find a value of `n` such that `Z(n) = m`, I know `Z(n+1)`, `Z(n+2)`, `Z(n+3)`, and `Z(n+4)` will also be `m`... unless `n+k` itself is a multiple of 5. If `n` *is* a multiple of 5, `Z(n)` may change again, which is where things get interesting. So I can loop to find n values!\n\nI think I have a solid understanding and approach to a solution now.  I can translate this into a Python script and optimize it later if necessary. Let's get coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n`'s and then the `n`'s themselves in increasing order.\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a prime factor in `n!`. This can be calculated using Legendre's formula:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\n\nLet's analyze the properties of `Z(n)`:\n1.  `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function.\n2.  `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.\n3.  If `n` is not a multiple of 5, then `Z(n) = Z(n-1)`. For example, `Z(5) = 1`, `Z(6) = 1`, `Z(7) = 1`, `Z(8) = 1`, `Z(9) = 1`.\n4.  When `n` is a multiple of 5, `Z(n)` increases compared to `Z(n-1)`. Specifically, `Z(n) - Z(n-1)` is equal to the number of factors of 5 in `n`. For example, `Z(5) - Z(4) = 1 - 0 = 1`. `Z(10) - Z(9) = 2 - 1 = 1`. `Z(25) - Z(24) = 6 - 4 = 2` (since 25 contributes two factors of 5).\n\nFrom property 3, if `Z(n) = m`, then `Z(n+1)`, `Z(n+2)`, `Z(n+3)`, `Z(n+4)` will also be `m`, provided that `n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` are not multiples of 5. Since `n` is an integer, if `n` is a multiple of 5, then `n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4` are not multiples of 5. If `n` is not a multiple of 5, then `n` itself is one of `X+1, X+2, X+3, X+4` where `X` is the largest multiple of 5 less than `n`.\nThis means that for any `m`, if there is an `n` such that `Z(n) = m`, then there will be exactly 5 such values of `n`: `n_0, n_0+1, n_0+2, n_0+3, n_0+4`, where `n_0` is the smallest multiple of 5 for which `Z(n_0) = m`.\nFor example, if `m=1`, `Z(5)=1`, `Z(6)=1`, `Z(7)=1`, `Z(8)=1`, `Z(9)=1`. There are 5 such `n`'s.\nIf `m=0`, there are 4 such `n`'s (1, 2, 3, 4). This pattern holds for `m > 0`.\n\nThe maximum value of `m` is 100,000. We need to find `n` such that `Z(n) = m`.\nSince `Z(n)` is roughly `n/4` (as `n/5 + n/25 + ... = n * (1/5 + 1/25 + ...) = n * ( (1/5) / (1 - 1/5) ) = n * (1/4)`), `n` can be up to approximately `4 * m`. For `m = 100,000`, `n` can be around `400,000`. We can iterate through `n` values to find the first `n` where `Z(n) = m`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the input `m`.\n2.  Define a function `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` that calculates `Z(n)` using Legendre's formula.\n3.  Initialize `n = 1`.\n4.  Loop while `count_trailing_zeroes(n) < m`:\n    Increment `n`.\n5.  After the loop, `n` is the smallest integer such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n6.  Check if `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` is exactly `m`.\n    *   If `count_trailing_zeroes(n) == m`: This means we found the starting `n`. The five values will be `n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4`. Print `5` and then these five values.\n    *   If `count_trailing_zeroes(n) > m`: This means `m` is a value that `Z(n)` \"skips over\". For example, `Z(24)=4` and `Z(25)=6`. If `m=5`, there is no `n` such that `Z(n)=5`. In this case, print `0`.\n\n**Optimization for finding `n`:**\nInstead of linear scan, we can use binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\nThe search range for `n` can be from `1` to `5 * m` (a safe upper bound, as `Z(n)` is approximately `n/4`).\nLet `low = 1`, `high = 5 * m`.\nWhile `low <= high`:\n  `mid = (low + high) // 2`\n  If `count_trailing_zeroes(mid) < m`:\n    `low = mid + 1`\n  Else:\n    `ans = mid`\n    `high = mid - 1`\nAfter binary search, `ans` will be the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`. Then proceed with step 6 of the algorithm.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (m=1):**\n1.  Input `m = 1`.\n2.  Binary search for smallest `n` where `Z(n) >= 1`.\n    *   `low=1, high=5`.\n    *   `mid=3`, `Z(3)=0 < 1`. `low=4`.\n    *   `low=4, high=5`.\n    *   `mid=4`, `Z(4)=0 < 1`. `low=5`.\n    *   `low=5, high=5`.\n    *   `mid=5`, `Z(5)=1 >= 1`. `ans=5`, `high=4`.\n    *   Loop ends. `ans = 5`.\n3.  Check `count_trailing_zeroes(ans)`: `Z(5) = 1`. This is equal to `m`.\n4.  The values are `5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.\n5.  Output:\n    `5`\n    `5 6 7 8 9`\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n!\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    i = 5\n    while n // i >= 1:\n        count += n // i\n        i *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(input())\n\n    # Binary search to find the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeroes(n) >= m\n    low = 1\n    # A safe upper bound for n is 5 * m.\n    # For m=100_000, n can be around 400_000. 5 * m = 500_000 is sufficient.\n    high = 5 * m \n    \n    # ans will store the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n    ans = -1 \n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeroes(mid) >= m:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    \n    # If ans is still -1, it means no n satisfies Z(n) >= m, which shouldn't happen for m >= 1.\n    # It would only happen if m was extremely large, exceeding Z(MAX_INT).\n    # For given constraints, ans will always be found.\n    \n    # Check if count_trailing_zeroes(ans) is exactly m\n    if count_trailing_zeroes(ans) == m:\n        # If it is, then ans, ans+1, ans+2, ans+3, ans+4 are the five numbers.\n        # This is because Z(k) = Z(k+1) = Z(k+2) = Z(k+3) = Z(k+4)\n        # if k+1, k+2, k+3, k+4 are not multiples of 5.\n        # Since ans is the smallest n such that Z(n) = m, ans must be a multiple of 5.\n        # (If ans was not a multiple of 5, say ans = k*5 + r where r in {1,2,3,4},\n        # then Z(ans-r) would also be m, contradicting ans being the smallest.\n        # So ans must be a multiple of 5.)\n        # Therefore, ans, ans+1, ans+2, ans+3, ans+4 will all have m trailing zeroes.\n        \n        # However, the smallest 'n' for a given 'm' might not be a multiple of 5.\n        # For example, if m=0, smallest n is 1.
