Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Problem Analysis and Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"TV Game\" problem. The core is figuring out the best moves for two players to maximize their combined score, essentially picking digits from a number to form the largest possible sums.  My initial thought is that simply going through all possible move combinations (brute force) won't work – the search space is way too huge, especially with `n` up to 18.  I need a smarter approach.  It's clear that the order in which players pick digits directly impacts the final sums, as the digits contribute differently based on their position.  I'm thinking dynamic programming might be a good fit here to avoid redundant calculations. The digit at each position can be assigned to either Homer or Marge. I think I will need to store the intermediate sums. Also it might be beneficial to cache the results of subproblems. I think a DP solution with the state representing the current position and the number of digits that Homer and Marge picked might work.\n\n**Digging into Dynamic Programming**\n\nI'm setting up my DP state:  `dp(k, s1_taken, s2_taken)`. `k` is the current digit's index, and `s1_taken` and `s2_taken` are the number of digits taken by Homer and Marge respectively, at digit `k`.  The goal is to determine the maximum sum from digit `k` to the end, given the current state of digit assignments.  Each choice is simple – either Homer takes digit `k` or Marge takes it.  The contribution of a digit depends on its position in the player's number (i.e., its significance -  multiplied by a power of 10). I'm constructing a recursive solution with memoization. The crucial observation is the powers of 10. `10^(N - (s_taken + 1))`. This seems a critical part to the problem. I'll need to reconstruct the path after running my DP algorithm.  The constraints (n <= 18) make me believe the algorithm is feasible.\n\n**Code and Refinement**\n\nNow, it's time to build the code. I'll translate my DP strategy into a Python script. I'll need to initialize my memoization table, handle the base case where all digits are assigned, and implement the recursion with the choices for each player and compute the best possible move. The logic for how much each digit contributes to the sum of a number is something I will need to check multiple times.  I should keep an eye out for off-by-one errors in my indices and power calculations, since I am taking the digits from the start of the number. The critical part is calculating the total value that will be added if a specific player picks a specific digit. Once the optimal path is found, the choice array will be the output.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a sequence of moves for Homer ('H') and Marge ('M') to maximize their total prize (S1 + S2), where each player makes exactly `n` moves. The input is `n` and a `2n`-digit number `A`. In each turn, the leftmost digit of `A` is taken.\n\nLet the digits of `A` be `d_0, d_1, ..., d_{2n-1}`.\nWhen a player takes a digit `d_k`, it is appended to their current number. If Homer has already taken `s1_taken` digits, `d_k` becomes the `(s1_taken + 1)`-th digit of S1. Its contribution to the total value of S1 will be `d_k * 10^(n - (s1_taken + 1))`. Similarly for Marge.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.\n\nLet `dp(k, s1_taken, s2_taken)` be the maximum total prize that can be obtained from the remaining digits `A[k]` through `A[2n-1]`, given that Homer has already taken `s1_taken` digits and Marge has taken `s2_taken` digits.\n\n**State:**\n*   `k`: The index of the current digit `A[k]` being considered (from `0` to `2n-1`).\n*   `s1_taken`: The number of digits Homer has taken so far (from `0` to `n`).\n*   `s2_taken`: The number of digits Marge has taken so far (from `0` to `n`).\n\n**Base Case:**\n*   If `k == 2n`:\n    *   If `s1_taken == n` and `s2_taken == n`, it means all digits have been assigned correctly. The remaining prize is `0`.\n    *   Otherwise (if counts don't match `n`), this path is invalid, so we return `-float('inf')` to indicate an impossible or suboptimal state.\n\n**Transitions:**\nFor `dp(k, s1_taken, s2_taken)`:\n1.  **Homer takes `A[k]`**:\n    *   This move is valid only if `s1_taken < n`.\n    *   The value `A[k]` contributes `int(A[k]) * 10^(n - (s1_taken + 1))` to S1.\n    *   The recursive call is `dp(k + 1, s1_taken + 1, s2_taken)`.\n    *   The total prize for this option is `int(A[k]) * 10^(n - (s1_taken + 1)) + dp(k + 1, s1_taken + 1, s2_taken)`.\n\n2.  **Marge takes `A[k]`**:\n    *   This move is valid only if `s2_taken < n`.\n    *   The value `A[k]` contributes `int(A[k]) * 10^(n - (s2_taken + 1))` to S2.\n    *   The recursive call is `dp(k + 1, s1_taken, s2_taken + 1)`.\n    *   The total prize for this option is `int(A[k]) * 10^(n - (s2_taken + 1)) + dp(k + 1, s1_taken, s2_taken + 1)`.\n\n`dp(k, s1_taken, s2_taken)` will be the maximum of the valid options. We also store the choice ('H' or 'M') that led to this maximum prize to reconstruct the path later.\n\n**Memoization:**\nA dictionary `memo` stores the calculated `dp` values, and `choices` stores the best move for each state.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Number of states: `k` goes from `0` to `2n-1` (`2n` values), `s1_taken` goes from `0` to `n` (`n+1` values), `s2_taken` goes from `0` to `n` (`n+1` values). Total states: `2n * (n+1)^2`.\n*   For `n=18`, `2n=36`. Number of states = `36 * 19 * 19 = 12996`.\n*   Each state calculation involves a few arithmetic operations and two recursive calls.\n*   Time complexity: `O(2n * n^2)`.\n*   Space complexity: `O(2n * n^2)` for memoization tables.\nThis is well within typical competitive programming limits for `n=18`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (A=\"1234\", n=2):**\nLet `N=2`.\n`dp(0, 0, 0)`:\n*   `A[0] = '1'`.\n*   **Homer takes '1'**: Contribution `1 * 10^(2-(0+1)) = 10`.
