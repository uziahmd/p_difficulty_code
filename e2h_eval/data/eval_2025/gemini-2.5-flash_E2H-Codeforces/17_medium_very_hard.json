            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Prefixes and Suffixes\n\nIvan wants to play a game with you. He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**I've got this coding challenge nailed!** It's all about prefixes and suffixes, and I've dissected the problem. The core idea is that if you have a string of length 'n', you can essentially *reconstruct* it from its (n-1)-length prefix and suffix. The magic is, there is a *critical constraint* that there are exactly two strings of *each* length from 1 to n-1 in the input.  This is the key that lets me do some fancy tricks.\n\nFirst, I read in the input and identify the two strings of length (n-1). These could either be the prefix or the suffix. Then, I check if these two strings can actually form a legitimate whole string, by checking the overlap, which boils down to `prefix[1:] == suffix[:-1]`. If not, it means this combination is impossible.\n\nIf they do form a consistent string, the real work begins. I can now derive the entire original string `s`, calculate *all* the expected prefixes and suffixes.  Next, I have to match them to what's in the input, assigning each input string a 'P' (prefix) or an 'S' (suffix). The tricky part is ensuring I don't double-count. This is where I use the `Counter` class. It lets me keep track of all expected prefixes and suffixes from my constructed string and mark them as used. Because there are 2 strings per length, as the problem guarantees, I know that all input strings need to match exactly one of the known prefix/suffixes. If one string matches both, the `Counter` will handle it.\n\nSo, for each of the two potential prefix-suffix pairings, I go through this process, and if I successfully assign every input string to either prefix or suffix, I've got my solution! The code is built this way. I loop through all cases, and if I reach a valid state, I can immediately stop.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine, for a given set of `2n-2` strings, which are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. We are guaranteed that these strings are *all* improper prefixes and suffixes (lengths 1 to `n-1`), and that there are exactly two strings for each length `k` from `1` to `n-1`.\n\nLet the unknown string be `s = s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}`.\nThe prefixes are `p_k = s_0 ... s_{k-1}` for `k = 1, ..., n-1`.\nThe suffixes are `suf_k = s_{n-k} ... s_{n-1}` for `k = 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nThe key observation is that the prefix of length `n-1` (`p_{n-1} = s_0 ... s_{n-2}`) and the suffix of length `n-1` (`suf_{n-1} = s_1 ... s_{n-1}`) uniquely determine the original string `s`.\nSpecifically, `s` can be formed by `p_{n-1}` followed by the last character of `suf_{n-1}`: `s = p_{n-1} + suf_{n-1}[-1]`.\nAlternatively, `s` can be formed by the first character of `p_{n-1}` followed by `suf_{n-1}`: `s = p_{n-1}[0] + suf_{n-1}`.\nFor these two ways to reconstruct `s` to be consistent, the middle part must match: `p_{n-1}[1:]` must be equal to `suf_{n-1}[:-1]`. This is because both represent `s_1 ... s_{n-2}`.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Read Input and Identify Candidates for `p_{n-1}` and `suf_{n-1}`**:\n    *   Read `n`.\n    *   Store all `2n-2` input strings, along with their original indices, in a list (e.g., `all_input_strings`).\n    *   Identify the two strings of length `n-1`. Let these be `(str1, idx1)` and `(str2, idx2)`, where `str1` and `str2` are the strings and `idx1`, `idx2` are their original indices.\n\n2.  **Test Two Possible Assignments for `p_{n-1}` and `suf_{n-1}`**:\n    There are two ways to assign `str1` and `str2` as the prefix and suffix of length `n-1`:\n    *   **Case 1**: `str1` is `p_{n-1}` and `str2` is `suf_{n-1}`.\n    *   **Case 2**: `str2` is `p_{n-1}` and `str1` is `suf_{n-1}`.\n\n    For each case:\n    a.  **Check Consistency**: Verify if `p_{n-1}[1:] == suf_{n-1}[:-1]`. If not, this assignment is invalid, and we move to the next case. (For `n=2`, `p_{n-1}` and `suf_{n-1}` are single characters. `p_{n-1}[1:]` and `suf_{n-1}[:-1]` are both empty strings, so they always match.)\n\n    b.  **Reconstruct `s`**: If consistent, form the candidate string `s_candidate = p_{n-1} + suf_{n-1}[-1]`.\n\n    c.  **Generate Expected Prefixes and Suffixes**: From `s_candidate`, generate all its proper prefixes (`s_candidate[:k]` for `k=1...n-1`) and proper suffixes (`s_candidate[n-k:]` for `k=1...n-1`).\n\n    d.  **Match Input Strings**:\n        *   Initialize an `answer` array of size `2n-2` to store 'P' or 'S' for each input string.\n        *   Mark `idx_p` as 'P' and `idx_suf` as 'S' in the `answer` array.\n        *   Use `collections.Counter` to keep track of the remaining expected prefixes and suffixes. For example, `prefix_counts = Counter(expected_prefixes)` and `suffix_counts = Counter(expected_suffixes)`.\n        *   Iterate through the `all_input_strings` (excluding `str1` and `str2`, which have already been assigned):\n            *   For each input string `s_val` at index `i`:\n                *   If `s_val` is present in `prefix_counts` and its count is greater than 0, assign 'P' to `answer[i]` and decrement `prefix_counts[s_val]`.\n                *   Else if `s_val` is present in `suffix_counts` and its count is greater than 0, assign 'S' to `answer[i]` and decrement `suffix_counts[s_val]`.\n                *   Else (if `s_val` doesn't match any remaining expected prefix or suffix), this `s_candidate` is invalid. Set a flag `is_valid_candidate = False` and break the loop.\n\n    e.  **Output and Exit**: If `is_valid_candidate` remains `True` after checking all strings, we have found a valid assignment. Print the joined `answer` array and terminate. The problem guarantees that at least one valid solution exists.\n\nThe use of `collections.Counter` is crucial because `s_candidate[:k]` might be identical to `s_candidate[n-k:]` for some `k`. The `Counter` correctly handles such duplicates, ensuring that one instance is matched as a prefix and the other as a suffix.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First example: `n=5`, `s=\"ababa\"`)**\nInput strings: `ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba`\nStrings of length `n-1=4`: `('abab', 2)` and `('baba', 5)`.\n\n**Case 1: `p_4 = 'abab'` (idx 2), `suf_4 = 'baba'` (idx 5)**\n1.  Consistency check: `abab[1:]` (`'bab'`) == `baba[:-1]` (`'bab'`). Yes.\n2.  `s_candidate = 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'`.\n3.  Expected prefixes: `['a', 'ab', 'aba', 'abab']`\n    Expected suffixes: `['a', 'ba', 'aba', 'baba']`\n4.  `prefix_counts = {'a':1, 'ab':1, 'aba':1, 'abab':1}`\n    `suffix_counts = {'a':1, 'ba':1, 'aba':1, 'baba':1}`\n5.  Initialize `result = [''] * 8`. Set `result[2] = 'P'`, `result[5] = 'S'`.\n6.  Decrement counts for `abab` (prefix) and `baba` (suffix).\n    `prefix_counts['abab'] = 0`, `suffix_counts['baba'] = 0`.\n7.  Iterate through remaining input strings:\n    *   `('ba', 0)`: Matches `suffix_counts['ba']`. `result[0]='S'`, `suffix_counts['ba']=0`.\n    *   `('a', 1)`: Matches `prefix_counts['a']`. `result[1]='P'`, `prefix_counts['a']=0`.\n    *   `('a', 3)`: Matches `suffix_counts['a']`. `result[3]='S'`, `suffix_counts['a']=0`.\n    *   `('aba', 4)`: Matches `prefix_counts['aba']`. `result[4]='P'`, `prefix_counts['aba']=0`.\n    *   `('ab', 6)`: Matches `prefix_counts['ab']`. `result[6]='P'`, `prefix_counts['ab']=0`.\n    *   `('aba', 7)`: Matches `suffix_counts['aba']`. `result[7]='S'`, `suffix_counts['aba']=0`.\n8.  All strings assigned successfully.
