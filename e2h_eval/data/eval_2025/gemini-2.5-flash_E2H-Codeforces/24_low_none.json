She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Solving the Browser Problem: A Thought Process**\n\nOkay, I'm tackling this \"Browser\" problem in competitive programming. It seems straightforward at first, but let's break it down methodically. I need to write a Python script that finds the minimum time to close tabs based on the given parameters: `n` total tabs, current position `pos`, and the range of kept tabs `l` and `r`.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the core of the problem. Essentially, I need to figure out which tabs to close and then find the most efficient sequence of actions (moving left/right and closing tabs) to achieve that.\n\nThe key operations are: moving the cursor (left or right) and closing tabs. Closing tabs, whether it's a large group or a single tab, takes a fixed time of 1 second. Movement, however, takes 1 second per step.\n\nLet's look at some edge cases. If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, I'm already in the optimal state, so the answer is zero. No time wasted!\n\nOtherwise, I have segments of tabs to close: `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.  The key insight is that closing a segment costs only one second, and my primary goal is to reach a position to execute this close.\n\nI can observe that to close the left segment `[1, l-1]`, I have to be at position `l`. And to close the right segment `[r+1, n]`, I need to be at position `r`.  The question is: what's the most efficient way to get to each of these positions?\n\nLet's examine how my position affects my options. When closing `[1, l-1]` I can safely assume that the minimum unclosed tab index is always going to be 1, until `l-1` is closed. Likewise, when closing `[r+1, n]` the maximum unclosed tab index will always be `n` until `r+1` is closed. This simplifies the moving logic.\n\nNow, my goal is to reach those positions: `l` and `r`. The time to close the segments is fixed (1 second each), so my focus is the cost of moving. I need to determine the optimal movement to position `l` and `r`. Does it matter which segment I close first? No! It does not matter as the time for the closing is always 1 second. The only critical aspect is reaching position `l` and position `r`.\n\nSo, the total time will be the sum of the movement time to reach `l` (if needed), the closing time for the left segment (if needed), the movement time to reach `r` (if needed), and the closing time for the right segment (if needed).\n\nNow, let's consider the specific scenarios. If I don't need to close any tabs (Case 1), the answer is zero. If I only need to close tabs to the left of `l` and if my current position, `pos`, is to the right of `l`, then I move left to get to `l` and the time is calculated by `pos - l`. I need to handle all these scenarios for a complete solution. Let's see how the details fall into place in the Python implementation.\n",
