Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Longest Repeated Substring Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the longest substring that repeats itself within a given string.  My approach is pretty straightforward: start big and work my way down.  If the string is of length *n*, the longest possible repeated substring is *n-1* (though it's unlikely).  I'll iterate, decreasing the substring length from *n-1* down to 1.  For each length *L*, I'll check all substrings of that length.\n\nThe core of it is this:  For a given length *L*, I need to go through the string, looking at every possible substring of length *L*.  I'll count how many times each substring appears in the original string. If any substring appears at least twice, boom, that's a candidate for my longest repeated substring, and I'm done. Since I'm decreasing *L*, the *first* such *L* I find is the answer.\n\nIf I get all the way down to a length of 1 and *none* of the substrings appear twice, then the answer is 0.\n\nLet's refine this a bit, using *s* for the string and *n* for its length. I'm essentially looking for the largest *L* where a substring of length *L* exists at least twice in *s*.\n\n**Here's the algorithm I'm formulating:**\n\n1.  I'll start with `max_len = 0`.\n2.  I'll loop from *n-1* down to 1. This loop is the key; it determines the length of substrings I will inspect.\n    *   For each value of *L*:\n        *   I will create a set to keep track of substrings to avoid re-counting.\n        *   I will loop from index 0 up to *n-L* within the original string *s* (this extracts all substrings of length *L*).\n            *   Let's call the substring `current_substring`.\n            *   I'll use the `.count()` method on the string *s* to check how many times `current_substring` appears.\n            *   If the count is greater than or equal to 2, I found a repeat! And I return *L* immediately, because I'm going downwards (biggest first), this is the largest valid substring length.\n\n3.  If this whole process finishes without finding any repeated substrings, I return 0.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Thinking this through with \"ababa\"):**\n\nLet's imagine the input string is \"ababa.\"\n\n*   `max_len` starts at 0.\n*   **L = 4**: I check substrings of length 4 (\"abab\" and \"baba\"). Both only appear once.\n*   **L = 3**: I check substrings of length 3 (\"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\").  \"aba\" appears at index 0 and 2, which is at least twice, therefore the answer is 3 and the process stops.\n*  The algorithm returns 3.\n",
