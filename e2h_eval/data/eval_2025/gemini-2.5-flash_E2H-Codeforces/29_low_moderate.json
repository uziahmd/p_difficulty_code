Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through a String Replacement Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me in the face, and it's a classic: string replacements followed by a modular sum. My initial reaction is, \"Hmm, this seems straightforward, but I bet there's a sneaky trick to avoid TLE.\"\n\nLet's break it down. I've got this string *s* made of digits, and a series of replacement queries, `d_i -> t_i`. Each query means replace *every* occurrence of digit `d_i` with the string `t_i`. The trick is, these queries are *ordered*. After all the replacements, I need to treat the resulting number (with leading zeros removed) and compute its value modulo 1000000007. Simple enough... on the surface.\n\nThe constraints are the real killers here. `|s|` and the number of queries, `n`, can both be up to 10^5, and the *sum* of the lengths of the replacement strings is also capped at 10^5. That immediately screams \"brute force string manipulation is *right out*.\"\n\nIf I tried to replace the digits directly, that string `s` could explode in size ridiculously fast. A single digit replacement could expand the string by 10^5. If I have 10^5 of those expanding digits, the string could reach 10^10! Even without the explosion, each replacement is O(length of current string * length of replacement string), which adds up to 10^10 operations even for a string that does not explode.\n\nModular arithmetic is my friend, though. The problem only asks for the result modulo 10^9 + 7.  That means I should be able to do all the calculations modulo that value, so I'm not dealing with massive numbers. This definitely means I shouldn't need to form the entire huge string. Instead, I need to compute the *value* of the resulting string using modular operations, while avoiding creating it directly. I need to keep track of the *value* and the *length*.\n\nThe key insight, as with so many of these problems, is in the *order* of operations. Replacing each `d_i` sequentially is not correct, because one replacement changes how a previous one affects a character. I need to think backwards. If I process the queries in reverse, the \"after-effects\" of *subsequent* operations are applied when I process earlier ones. By doing this, I'm thinking of how later substitutions affect earlier ones. This should keep everything manageable.\n\nHere's how I think I can make this work: I'll maintain, for each digit `d` (0-9), two values: `val[d]` which will hold the *modular numerical value* the digit will eventually have, and `len[d]`, which will hold the *length* of digits it will become. Initially, before any queries (or after *conceptually* applying all queries), `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1`.\n\nNow, I process the queries in reverse. When I hit a query `d_i -> t_i`, the goal is to update `val[d_i]` and `len[d_i]` based on what will *happen* to `t_i` from subsequent queries. I think this will work... I just need to figure out how to update those `val` and `len` values efficiently during each reversed query application.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of string replacements and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The initial string `s` can have length up to 10^5, there can be up to 10^5 queries, and the sum of lengths of replacement strings `ti` can be up to 10^5. A direct simulation of string replacement would be too slow because the string `s` could grow exponentially (e.g., '1' -> '11' -> '1111' -> ...).\n\nThe key insight for this type of problem is to process the queries in reverse order. When we process a query `di -> ti` in reverse, all subsequent queries (which would have been processed *after* this one in forward order) have already been \"applied\" to the representations of individual digits.\n\nLet's maintain two pieces of information for each digit `d` (0 through 9):\n1.  `val[d]`: The numerical value (modulo `MOD`) that `d` would represent after all *subsequent* transformations have been applied to it.\n2.  `p10[d]`: The power of 10 (modulo `MOD`) corresponding to the length `d` would expand to after all *subsequent* transformations. This is equivalent to `10^(length_of_d) mod MOD`.\n\nInitially, before any queries are processed (or conceptually, after all queries have been processed in forward order, meaning no more transformations are pending):\n*   For each digit `d` from 0 to 9:\n    *   `val[d] = d`\n    *   `p10[d] = 10` (since a single digit `d` has length 1, `10^1 = 10`)\n\nNow, we process the queries `Q_n, Q_{n-1}, ..., Q_1` in reverse order.\nLet the current query be `di -> ti`. We want to determine what `di` transforms into *if this query were the last one to be applied to `di`*.\nThe string `ti` itself might contain digits that would be transformed by queries `Q_{i+1}, ..., Q_n`. Since we are processing in reverse, `val[digit]` and `p10[digit]` already reflect the effect of `Q_{i+1}, ..., Q_n` for any `digit` in `ti`.\n\nSo, to compute the new `val[di]` and `p10[di]` based on `ti`:\nLet `new_val_di = 0` and `new_p10_di = 1`.\nWe iterate through the characters `c` in `ti` from left to right:\n*   `digit = int(c)`\n*   `new_val_di = (new_val_di * p10[digit] + val[digit]) % MOD`\n*   `new_p10_di = (new_p10_di * p10[digit]) % MOD`\n\nAfter iterating through all characters in `ti`, `new_val_di` will be the numerical value of `ti` (after `Q_{i+1}, ..., Q_n` are applied to its digits), and `new_p10_di` will be `10^(length_of_ti_after_subsequent_transforms)`.\nWe then update:\n*   `val[di] = new_val_di`\n*   `p10[di] = new_p10_di`\n\nAfter processing all queries in reverse, `val[d]` and `p10[d]` will correctly reflect the final value and length for each original digit `d` in the initial string `s`.\n\nFinally, we calculate the result for the initial string `s`.\nLet `final_ans = 0` and `current_power_of_10 = 1`.\nWe iterate through the characters `c` in `s` from right to left (to correctly apply powers of 10):\n*   `digit = int(c)`\n*   `final_ans = (final_ans + val[digit] * current_power_of_10) % MOD`\n*   `current_power_of_10 = (current_power_of_10 * p10[digit]) % MOD`\n\nThe `MOD` value is `10^9 + 7`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (from problem description):**\n`s = 222`, `n = 2`\n`2->0`\n`0->7`\n\n`MOD = 1000000007`\n\n**Initial state:**\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`p10 = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`\n\n**Queries in reverse:**\n1.  **Query 2: `0->7`**\n    *   `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`\n    *   `new_val_0 = 0`, `new_p10_0 = 1`\n    *   For `c = '7'` in `ti`:\n        *   `digit = 7`\n        *   `new_val_0 = (0 * p10[7] + val[7]) % MOD = (0 * 10 + 7) % MOD = 7`\n        *   `new_p10_0 = (1 * p10[7]) % MOD = (1 * 10) % MOD = 10`\n    *   Update: `val[0] = 7`, `p10[0] = 10`\n    *   `val = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    *   `p10 = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`\n\n2.  **Query 1: `2->0`**\n    *   `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`\n    *   `new_val_2 = 0`, `new_p10_2 = 1`\n    *   For `c = '0'` in `ti`:\n        *   `digit = 0`\n        *   `new_val_2 = (0 * p10[0] + val[0]) % MOD = (0 * 10 + 7) % MOD = 7`\n        *   `new_p10_2 = (1 * p10[0]) % MOD = (1 * 10) % MOD = 10`\n    *   Update: `val[2] = 7`, `p10[2] = 10`\n    *   `val = [7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    *   `p10 = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`\n\n**Final calculation for `s = \"222\"`:**\n`final_ans = 0`, `current_power_of_10 = 1`\nIterate `s` from right to left:\n*   `c = '2'` (rightmost):\n    *   `digit = 2`\n    *   `final_ans = (0 + val[2] * 1) % MOD = (0 + 7 * 1) % MOD = 7`\n    *   `current_power_of_10 = (1 * p10[2]) % MOD = (1 * 10) % MOD = 10`\n*   `c = '2'` (middle):\n    *   `digit = 2`\n    *   `final_ans = (7 + val[2] * 10) % MOD = (7 + 7 * 10) % MOD = (7 + 70) % MOD = 77`\n    *   `current_power_of_10 = (10 * p10[2]) % MOD = (10 * 10) % MOD = 100`\n*   `c = '2'` (leftmost):\n    *   `digit = 2`\n    *   `final_ans = (77 + val[2] * 100) % MOD = (77 + 7 * 100) % MOD = (77 + 700) % MOD = 777`\n    *   `current_power_of_10 = (100 * p10[2]) % MOD = (100 * 10) % MOD = 1000`\n\nResult: `777`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   **Empty `ti`**: If `ti` is empty, `new_val_di` remains 0 and `new_p10_di` remains 1. This correctly represents that the digit `di` disappears (value 0, length 0, so `10^0 = 1` for `p10`).\n*   **Leading Zeros**: The problem states \"ignore the leading zeroes\". Our modular arithmetic approach naturally handles this. If `s` becomes \"007\", its value is 7. If `s` becomes \"0\", its value is 0. If `s` becomes empty, it's 0. Our `final_ans` will be 0 if the string effectively becomes empty or all zeros.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Initialization**: `O(1)` (10 digits).\n*   **Processing Queries**: `n` queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. The sum of lengths of `ti` is at most `10^5`. So, this phase is `O(sum_len_ti)`.\n*   **Final Calculation**: Iterate through `s`. `O(|s|)`.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(|s| + sum_len_ti + n)`. Given `|s| <= 10^5`, `n <= 10^5`, `sum_len_ti <= 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n*   Space complexity: `O(1)` for `val` and `p10` arrays (10 elements each), plus `O(n)` to store queries. This is also efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries_raw = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries_raw.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n\n    # val[d] stores the numerical value of digit d after all subsequent transformations\n    # p10[d] stores 10^(length of d after all subsequent transformations) mod MOD\n    # Initially, each digit d represents itself and has length 1.\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    p10 = [10 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        query_str = queries_raw[i]\n        d_char, t_str = query_str.split('->')\n        d_val = int(d_char)\n\n        new_val_for_d = 0\n        new_p10_for_d = 1 # Represents 10^0 for an empty string or initial state\n\n        # If t_str is empty, d_val effectively becomes 0 and its length becomes 0.\n        # new_val_for_d will remain 0, new_p10_for_d will remain 1.
