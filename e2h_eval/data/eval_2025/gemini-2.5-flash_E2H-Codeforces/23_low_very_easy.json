            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Mahjong Puzzle**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\" problem. The core is figuring out the minimum draws to get at least one \"mentsu\" (either a triplet or a sequence) from three initial tiles.  Seems straightforward enough.\n\nFirst, I'll represent the tiles. Each has a number and a suit. Easy peasy. The input is three strings.\n\nLet's think. The simplest case is **zero draws**.  I check if those three tiles *already* make a mentsu.  That's a quick check: are they all identical (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu)?  For a koutsu, just equality checks. For shuntsu, same suit and the numbers form a sequence.  I'll need to extract the numbers, sort them, and verify the sequential relationship.\n\nIf zero draws doesn't work, what about **one draw**?  Here's where it gets interesting. I don't need to consider every possible tile, because any tile is potentially available. Basically, I need to see if any one tile can complete a mentsu with a pair from the initial three.\n\nSo, I'll go through the pairs of initial tiles.  If any two tiles are the same, drawing a third of that tile solves it - a koutsu. If they're a potential shuntsu, they must be the same suit. Then, let's look at their numbers:\n*   **Consecutive:** I can get a shuntsu by drawing a number before or after.\n*   **Gap of 1:** We're on the right track! Just draw the middle tile.\n\nIf all the single draws fail, the answer is surely two. So I just have to check the first two cases.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles (0, 1, or 2) Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. A mentsu can be a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles.\n\nLet the three input tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. We can represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`. For example, \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`.\n\nWe check for the minimum number of draws in increasing order: 0, 1, then 2.\n\n**0 Draws:**\nTo check if a mentsu can be formed with 0 draws, we examine the initial three tiles `t1, t2, t3`.\n1.  **Koutsu:** Are all three tiles identical? `t1 == t2 and t2 == t3`.\n2.  **Shuntsu:**\n    *   Are all three tiles of the same suit?\n    *   If yes, extract their numbers. Let them be `n1, n2, n3`.\n    *   Sort these numbers. Check if they form a sequence: `min_n, min_n + 1, min_n + 2`.\nIf either a koutsu or a shuntsu is found, the answer is 0.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, we check if 1 draw is sufficient. This means we are looking for a pair of initial tiles that can form a mentsu with one additional tile.\nConsider all unique pairs of tiles from `(t1, t2, t3)`: `(t1, t2), (t1, t3), (t2, t3)`.\nFor each pair `(tile_A, tile_B)`:\n1.  **Potential Koutsu:** If `tile_A == tile_B`, we can draw `tile_A` (or `tile_B`) to form a koutsu `[tile_A, tile_A, tile_A]`.\n2.  **Potential Shuntsu:** If `tile_A` and `tile_B` are of the same suit, let their numbers be `nA, nB`.\n    *   If `|nA - nB| == 1` (e.g., '1s', '2s'), we can draw `min(nA, nB) - 1` (if valid, e.g., '0s' is not valid) or `max(nA, nB) + 1` (if valid). For example, with `[1s, 2s]`, drawing `3s` forms `[1s, 2s, 3s]`. With `[8s, 9s]`, drawing `7s` forms `[7s, 8s, 9s]`.\n    *   If `|nA - nB| == 2` (e.g., '1s', '3s'), we can draw the middle tile `min(nA, nB) + 1`. For example, with `[1s, 3s]`, drawing `2s` forms `[1s, 2s, 3s]`.\nIf any of these conditions are met for any pair, the answer is 1.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, it means we cannot form a mentsu with the initial three tiles, nor can we complete a mentsu from any pair of initial tiles with one draw. In this scenario, we can always form a mentsu with two draws. For example, we can draw two tiles identical to `t1` to form a koutsu `[t1, t1, t1]`. Since we can draw any tile infinitely, this is always possible. Thus, the maximum answer is 2.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\nTo handle tile parsing and comparisons easily, we can convert the input strings into a more structured format. A list of tuples `[(number, suit), ...]` or a list of strings `['1s', '2s', ...]` that are sorted for sequence checks can be used. Sorting the initial three tiles numerically and then by suit can simplify sequence checks.\n\nLet's use `(number, suit)` tuples.\n`parse_tile(s)`: converts \"1s\" to `(1, 's')`.\n\n```python\ndef parse_tile(s):\n    return (int(s[0]), s[1])\n\ndef solve():\n    tiles_str = input().split()\n    tiles = [parse_tile(s) for s in tiles_str]\n\n    # Sort tiles for easier sequence checking\n    # Sort by suit first, then by number\n    tiles.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # Check for 0 draws\n    # Case 1: Koutsu (Triplet)\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Case 2: Shuntsu (Sequence)\n    # All must be same suit and consecutive numbers\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]:\n        if tiles[0][0] + 1 == tiles[1][0] and tiles[1][0] + 1 == tiles[2][0]:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # Check for 1 draw\n    # We need to consider pairs of tiles from the initial hand.\n    # There are 3 pairs: (t0, t1), (t0, t2), (t1, t2)\n    # Using a set of pairs to avoid redundant checks if tiles are identical\n    unique_pairs = set()\n    unique_pairs.add(tuple(sorted((tiles[0], tiles[1]))))\n    unique_pairs.add(tuple(sorted((tiles[0], tiles[2]))))\n    unique_pairs.add(tuple(sorted((tiles[1], tiles[2]))))\n\n    for t_a, t_b in unique_pairs:\n        # Potential Koutsu: if two tiles are identical, drawing one more makes a koutsu\n        if t_a == t_b:\n            print(1)\n            return\n\n        # Potential Shuntsu: if two tiles are of the same suit\n        if t_a[1] == t_b[1]:\n            num_a, suit = t_a\n            num_b, _ = t_b\n\n            # If numbers are consecutive (e.g., 1s 2s), we can draw 0s (invalid) or 3s\n            # Or draw 3s (1s 2s 3s) or 0s (not possible)\n            # Or draw 0s (not possible) or 7s (8s 9s 7s)\n            if abs(num_a - num_b) == 1:\n                # e.g., (1,s), (2,s).
