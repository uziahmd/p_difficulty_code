    "thought": "**The Quest for \"Good\" Trees: A Deep Dive into a Competitive Programming Challenge**\n\nMy mission is to solve a fascinating problem: calculating the sum of `d(1, n)` across all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. \"Good\" trees are those with specific weight and degree constraints. Let me dissect the problem: a good tree has `n` vertices, edge weights of 1 or -1, and, crucially, for each vertex, the product of incident edge weights equals -1. The function `d(u, v)` represents the sum of edge weights along the unique path between vertices `u` and `v`. The goal is to sum these path sums for all possible good trees.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the \"good\" condition. It leads me to a critical discovery: only even values of `n` yield any \"good\" trees. If `n` is odd, there are no solutions. This observation arises from examining the product of all incident edge weights, ultimately revealing an inconsistency when `n` is odd. This is the first optimization. For all odd values of `n`, I immediately return 0.\n\nAssuming `n` is even, I move forward to explore the system of linear equations in GF(2) that results from the \"good\" condition. The key is to analyze the incidence matrix of the tree. I then realize that the system of equations has a unique solution when `n` is even. This tells me that for any given tree structure (a graph without weights), there's precisely one way to assign edge weights to make it \"good\". This is critical because it collapses the search space, allowing for enumeration over just the tree structures and then finding the sum of all such tree structure path sums.\n\nThe real challenge now is calculating the weight of an edge. I then develop an algorithm that tells me the weight of an edge is based on the size of the components of the tree formed when that edge is removed. If `|C_e(1)|` is the size of the connected component, then the weight is `(-1)^{|C_e(1)|}`. This simplifies the weight computation considerably.\n\nThe problem, therefore, is to sum this value over all trees: `sum_{T} sum_{e in P_T(1,n)} (-1)^{|C_e(1)|}`.\nI now focus on analyzing the path from 1 to n in a tree. The edge weights are calculated by the size of the two components formed when the edge is removed.\n\nAfter considerable exploration, I then arrive at the final formula that uses stars and bars. Let `C_e(1)` be the component containing 1.\n`sum_{T} sum_{e in P_T(1,n)} (-1)^{|C_e(1)|} = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * binom(n-2, k-1) * k(n-k) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}`.\nI use the binomial coefficient to count the trees based on the component size k. `k(n-k)` reflects the edge, and the final terms are `k^{k-2}` and `(n-k)^{n-k-2}`, reflecting the number of trees.\nThis sums up the sum I have to compute.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of `d(1, n)` over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353. An edge-weighted tree is \"good\" if each edge has weight `1` or `-1`, and for each vertex `i`, the product of weights of edges incident to `i` is `-1`. `d(u,v)` is the sum of weights of edges on the unique path from `u` to `v`.\n\n**1. Condition for `n`:**\nLet `w(e)` be the weight of edge `e`. For each vertex `i`, let `P_i = product_{e incident to i} w(e)`. The condition is `P_i = -1` for all `i`.\nConsider the product `P = product_{i=1}^n P_i`.\nOn one hand, `P = product_{i=1}^n (-1) = (-1)^n`.\nOn the other hand, each edge `e=(u,v)` contributes `w(e)` to `P_u` and `w(e)` to `P_v`. So `w(e)` appears twice in `P`.\nThus, `P = product_{e in E} (w(e))^2`. Since `w(e) in {1, -1}`, `(w(e))^2 = 1` for all `e`.\nSo, `P = 1^(n-1) = 1`.\nEquating the two expressions for `P`, we get `(-1)^n = 1`. This implies `n` must be an even integer.\nIf `n` is odd, there are no good trees, so the sum of `d(1, n)` is `0`.\nThis covers the cases `n=1` (output `0`) and `n=3` (output `0` if it were an example).\n\n**2. Unique Weight Assignment for a Fixed Tree Structure:**\nAssume `n` is even. For a given tree structure `T`, let `x_e = 1` if `w(e) = -1` and `x_e = 0` if `w(e) = 1`. The condition `product_{e incident to i} w(e) = -1` translates to `sum_{e incident to i} x_e = 1 (mod 2)`.\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations in `n-1` variables (the `x_e` values) over `GF(2)`.\nAs shown in many sources (e.g., related to cycle space of a graph), for a tree, the rank of its incidence matrix over `GF(2)` is `n-1`. The sum of all rows of the incidence matrix is the zero vector. Since `n` is even, `sum_{i=1}^n 1 = n = 0 (mod 2)`. This means the system is consistent.\nSince the system has `n-1` independent equations and `n-1` variables, there is a unique solution for `x_e` (and thus for `w(e)`).\nTherefore, for any fixed tree structure `T` (on `n` labeled vertices), there is exactly one way to assign weights `w(e) in {1, -1}` to its edges such that `T` is a good tree.\n\n**3. Determining Edge Weights:**\nFor any edge `e=(u,v)` in a tree `T`, removing `e` splits `T` into two connected components, say `C_u` containing `u` and `C_v` containing `v`. Let `S_u` and `S_v` be the sets of vertices in `C_u` and `C_v` respectively.\nConsider the product `product_{i in S_u} P_i`. This must be `(-1)^{|S_u|}`.\nEach edge `e'=(a,b)` with both `a,b in S_u` contributes `w(e')^2 = 1` to this product.\nThe only edge connecting a vertex in `S_u` to a vertex outside `S_u` is `e=(u,v)`. This edge contributes `w(u,v)` to the product `P_u`.\nSo, `product_{i in S_u} P_i = w(u,v) * product_{e' in E(C_u)} (w(e'))^2 = w(u,v)`.\nTherefore, `w(u,v) = (-1)^{|S_u|}`. Similarly, `w(u,v) = (-1)^{|S_v|}`.\nSince `n` is even, `|S_u|` and `|S_v| = n - |S_u|` have the same parity, so `(-1)^{|S_u|} = (-1)^{|S_v|}`.\nThis means the weight of an edge `e` is determined by the size of either component formed by removing `e`.\n\n**4. Summing `d(1, n)`:**\nWe need to calculate `sum_T sum_{e in P_T(1,n)} w_T(e)`.\nUsing linearity of summation, we can swap the sums: `sum_{e} sum_{T: e in P_T(1,n)} w_T(e)`.\nLet's consider an arbitrary edge `e=(u,v)`. Its weight `w_T(e)` is `(-1)^{|C_e(1)|}`, where `C_e(1)` is the component containing vertex `1` when `e` is removed.\nFor `e` to be on the path `P_T(1,n)`, `1` and `n` must be in different components when `e` is removed. This means `1 in C_e(1)` and `n in C_e(n)`.\nLet `k = |C_e(1)|`. Then `k` can range from `1` to `n-1`.\nThe number of trees `T` such that `e=(u,v)` is on `P_T(1,n)` and `|C_e(1)|=k` is given by the following construction:\n*   Choose `k-1` vertices (excluding `1` and `n`) to be in `C_e(1)`: `binom(n-2, k-1)` ways.\n*   The remaining `n-k-1` vertices (excluding `1` and `n`) form `C_e(n)` along with `n`.\n*   The vertices in `C_e(1)` must form a tree: `k^{k-2}` ways (using Cayley's formula, with `1^{1-2}=1` for `k=1` and `2^{2-2}=1` for `k=2`).\n*   The vertices in `C_e(n)` must form a tree: `(n-k)^{n-k-2}` ways.\n*   The edge `e=(u,v)` must connect a vertex `u` from `C_e(1)` to a vertex `v` from `C_e(n)`. There are `k(n-k)` choices for such an edge.\n\nSo, for a fixed `k`, the sum of `w_T(e)` for all edges `e` on `P_T(1,n)` such that `|C_e(1)|=k` is:\n`(-1)^k * binom(n-2, k-1) * k(n-k) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}`.\nSumming over all possible `k`:\n`S = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * binom(n-2, k-1) * k(n-k) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}`.\nLet `f(x) = x^{x-2}` for `x >= 2` and `f(1)=1`. The expression becomes:\n`S = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * binom(n-2, k-1) * k(n-k) * f(k) * f(n-k)`.\n\n**5. Special Cases and Simplifications:**\n*   If `n=1`, `S=0`.\n*   If `n=2`:\n    `k` can only be `1`.\n    `S = (-1)^1 * binom(0, 0) * 1 * (2-1) * f(1) * f(2-1)`\n    `S = -1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = -1`.\n    This matches the example output `998244352` (which is `-1 mod 998244353`).\n\n**6. Evaluating the Sum:**\nThe sum can be rewritten using `k(n-k) * f(k) * f(n-k) = k(n-k) * k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}`.\nFor `k=1`, `1 * (n-1) * 1 * (n-1)^{n-3} = (n-1)^{n-2}`.\nFor `k=n-1`, `(n-1) * 1 * (n-1)^{n-3} * 1 = (n-1)^{n-2}`.\nSo the terms are:\n`S = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * (n-2)! / ((k-1)! (n-k-1)!) * k^{k-1} * (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nThis is a known identity related to sums over paths in trees.\nThe sum `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} binom(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}` is `(n-1) n^{n-3}` (for `n >= 2`). This is the number of trees where an edge is specified to be on the path between two fixed vertices.\n\nA specific identity (related to Abel's identity or trees with two specified nodes) is:\n`sum_{k=1}^{n-1} binom(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = 2 (n-1) n^{n-3}`. (This counts paths between 1 and n.\nNo, that's not quite right.\nThe number of trees on `n` labeled vertices where `1` and `n` are in different components after removing an edge `e` (and `|C_e(1)|=k`) is `binom(n-2, k-1) k^{k-2} (n-k)^{n-k-2} k(n-k)`.\nThis is `binom(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nThe sum over `k` of this term is `n^{n-3} * (n-1)`. This is the total number of edges on paths between `1` and `n` over all trees.\nWait, the formula for `k^{k-2}` and `(n-k)^{n-k-2}` is for `k >= 1` using `x^{x-2}` convention for `x=1` and `x=2`.\nThe sum is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * C(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\n\nLet's check the example `n=4`.\n`S = sum_{k=1}^{3} (-1)^k * binom(2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (4-k)^{4-k-1}`\n`k=1: (-1)^1 * binom(2,0) * 1^0 * 3^2 = -1 * 1 * 1 * 9 = -9`\n`k=2: (-1)^2 * binom(2,1) * 2^1 * 2^1 = 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`\n`k=3: (-1)^3 * binom(2,2) * 3^2 * 1^0 = -1 * 1 * 9 * 1 = -9`\n`S = -9 + 8 - 9 = -10`.\nThis matches the example output `998244343` (which is `-10 mod 998244353`).\n\nThe general formula for `n` even is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k * C(n-2, k-1) * k^{k-1} * (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nThis sum is a variant of a known identity.\nThe identity `sum_{k=0}^n binom(n,k) (x+ky)^{k-1} (z+(n-k)y)^{n-k-1} = (x+z) (x+z+ny)^{n-1} / (x z)` (for `x,z != 0`)\nThis is too complex.\nA simpler identity is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} binom(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = (n-1)n^{n-3}`.\nThis sum `S` is alternating.\nThe sum can be simplified using the identity `sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k binom(n,k) (k+a)^k (n-k+b)^{n-k} = 0` if `a+b != 0`.\nThis is not exactly what we have.\n\nLet's use the identity `sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (x+k)^{k-1} (y+n-k)^{n-k-1} = (\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}) (x+y+n)^{n-1}`.\nLet `n' = n-2`. The sum is `sum_{k=0}^{n'} (-1)^{k+1} \\binom{n'}{k} (k+1)^{k} (n'-k+1)^{n'-k}`.\nThis is not directly applicable.\n\nLet's look at the sequence of sums for even `n`:\n`n=2: -1`\n`n=4: -10`\n`n=6: sum_{k=1}^5 (-1)^k C(4, k-1) k^{k-1} (6-k)^{5-k}`\n`k=1: -1 * C(4,0) * 1^0 * 5^4 = -625`\n`k=2: +1 * C(4,1) * 2^1 * 4^3 = +1 * 4 * 2 * 64 = +512`\n`k=3: -1 * C(4,2) * 3^2 * 3^2 = -1 * 6 * 9 * 9 = -486`\n`k=4: +1 * C(4,3) * 4^3 * 2^1 = +1 * 4 * 64 * 2 = +512`\n`k=5: -1 * C(4,4) * 5^4 * 1^0 = -1 * 1 * 625 * 1 = -625`\n`S = -625 + 512 - 486 + 512 - 625 = -712`\n\nThe values are `n=2: -1`, `n=4: -10`, `n=6: -712`.\nThese are `-(n-1) * (n-2)! / (n-1)! * n^{n-3}`? No.\nThe sum is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k binom(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nThis is `-(n-1)^{n-2} + sum_{k=2}^{n-2} (-1)^k binom(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} + (-1)^{n-1} (n-1)^{n-2}`.\nSince `n` is even, `n-1` is odd. So `(-1)^{n-1} = -1`.\n`S = -2(n-1)^{n-2} + sum_{k=2}^{n-2} (-1)^k binom(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\n\nThis sum is `-(n-1) n^{n-3}` for `n` even and `n >= 2`.\nLet's check:\n`n=2: -(2-1) * 2^{2-3} = -1 * 2^{-1} = -1/2`. This is not an integer.\nThe formula `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}` is equivalent to `-(n-1) n^{n-3}` IF `n` is odd.\nThe identity for `n` even is `-(n-1) n^{n-3} + 2 (n-1)^{n-2}`. No, that's incorrect.\n\nThe identity is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = (n-1)n^{n-3}`.\nThis is for the unsigned sum.\n\nLet `S(n) = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k binom(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nFor `n=2`, `S(2) = -1`.\nFor `n=4`, `S(4) = -10`.\nFor `n=6`, `S(6) = -712`.\nThese values are `-(n-1) * (n-2)! / (n-1)! * n^{n-3}`? No.\n\nThe result is `-(n-1) n^{n-3}` for `n` odd and `0` for `n` even. This is for a different problem.\n\nLet's consider the identity `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = (n-1)n^{n-3}`.\nThis is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = (n-1)n^{n-3}` for `n >= 3`.\nFor `n=2`, it's `\\binom{0}{0} 1^0 1^0 = 1`. And `(2-1)2^{2-3} = 1/2`. So this identity is for `n >= 3`.\n\nFor `n=2`, the answer is `-1`.\nFor `n >= 3` and `n` even, the sum is `-(n-1)n^{n-3}`.\nLet's check this for `n=4`: `-(4-1)4^{4-3} = -3 * 4^1 = -12`. This is not `-10`.\n\nThe provided examples are:\n`n=2`: `-1`\n`n=4`: `-10`\nThe formula `-(n-1)n^{n-3}` seems to be related to the number of paths between two fixed nodes.\nThe identity `sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (k+x)^k (n-k+y)^{n-k} = 0` if `x+y=0`.\nLet `m = n-2`. `S = sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^{k+1} \\binom{m}{k} (k+1)^k (m-k+1)^{m-k}`.\nThis is `S = - sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \\binom{m}{k} (k+1)^k (m-k+1)^{m-k}`.\nThis sum is `-(m+1)^{m-1} = -(n-1)^{n-3}`.\nLet's check:\n`n=2`: `m=0`. `S = - (-1)^0 \\binom{0}{0} (0+1)^0 (0-0+1)^0 = -1`.

Incorrect, example is `-10`.\n\nThis implies the identity used is not correct for this form or the power `k` vs `k-1` matters.\nThe identity is `sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (x+k)^{k-1} (y+n-k)^{n-k-1} = \\frac{(x+y+n)^{n-1}}{xy} \\text{ if } x+y \\neq 0`.\nLet `n' = n-2`.

Incorrect.\nThe formula `-(n-1)n^{n-3}` is for counting \"rooted paths\" in trees.\n\nLet's re-examine the sum `S = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k binom(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nThis is `sum_{k=0}^{n-2} (-1)^{k+1} binom(n-2, k) (k+1)^k (n-k-1)^{n-k-2}`.\nLet `m = n-2`.\n`S = - sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k binom(m,k) (k+1)^k (m-k+1)^{m-k}`.\nThis sum `sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k binom(m,k) (k+1)^k (m-k+1)^{m-k}` is `(m+1)^{m-1}`.\nSo `S = -(m+1)^{m-1} = -(n-1)^{n-3}`.\nLet's check this formula:\n`n=2: S = -(2-1)^{2-3} = -1^{-1} = -1`. Correct. (By convention `1^{-1}=1`).\n`n=4: S = -(4-1)^{4-3} = -3^1 = -3`. Incorrect, example is `-10`.\n\nThis means the identity `sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k binom(m,k) (k+1)^k (m-k+1)^{m-k} = (m+1)^{m-1}` is only valid for `m=0` (i.e., `n=2`). For `m > 0`, it's not `(m+1)^{m-1}`.\nThe identity `sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (k+x)^k (n-k+y)^{n-k} = 0` if `x+y=0` is for powers `k` and `n-k`.\nOur powers are `k-1` and `n-k-1`.\n\nLet's use the generating function approach.\nThe sum `S` is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nFor `n \\ge 3`, this sum is `-(n-1)n^{n-3}` if `n` is odd.\nFor `n \\ge 2` and `n` even, the sum is `-(n-1)^{n-2} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} (-1)^j \\binom{n-2}{j} (\\frac{j+1}{n-1})^{j} (\\frac{n-j-1}{n-1})^{n-j-2}`\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nLet's revisit the examples:\n`n=2`: output `-1`. My formula `-(n-1)^{n-3}` gives `-1`.\n`n=4`: output `-10`. My formula `-(n-1)^{n-3}` gives `-3`.\nThe difference is `(-10) - (-3) = -7`.\n`n=6`: output `-712`. My formula `-(6-1)^{6-3} = -5^3 = -125`.\nThe difference is `(-712) - (-125) = -587`.\nThere is some other term.\n\nThe identity `sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (x+k)^{k-1} (y+n-k)^{n-k-1} = \\frac{(x+y+n)^n}{xy}` for `x,y != 0`.\nNo, it's `(x+y+n)^{n-1} \\cdot (\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y})`.\nThe sum is `sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nLet `m=n-2`.\n`S = \\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^{k+1} \\binom{m}{k} (k+1)^k (m-k+1)^{m-k}`.\nThis is `S = - \\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \\binom{m}{k} (k+1)^k (m-k+1)^{m-k}`.\nThis sum is `(m+1)^{m-1}` if `m=0` (i.e., `n=2`).\nFor `m > 0`, the sum `\\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \\binom{m}{k} (k+1)^k (m-k+1)^{m-k}` is `0` if `m` is odd.\nIf `m` is even and `m > 0`, the sum is `-(m+1) \\binom{m}{m/2} (m/2)! (m/2)! \\frac{1}{ (m/2+1)! (m/2+1)! }` No.\n\nThis sum is `-(n-1)^{n-3}` for all even `n` IF the `k^{k-1}` and `(n-k)^{n-k-1}` terms are interpreted carefully.\nLet `P(x,y) = x^{x-1} y^{y-1}`.\n`n=2`: `(-1)^1 * C(0,0) * P(1,1) = -1 * 1 * 1 = -1`.\n`n=4`: `(-1)^1 C(2,0) P(1,3) + (-1)^2 C(2,1) P(2,2) + (-1)^3 C(2,2) P(3,1)`\n`= -1 * 1 * 1^0 * 3^2 + 1 * 2 * 2^1 * 2^1 - 1 * 1 * 3^2 * 1^0`\n`= -9 + 8 - 9 = -10`.\nThis is exactly the formula `S = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k binom(n-2, k-1) k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\nThis formula works for `n=2` and `n=4`.\nSo, the task is to compute this sum modulo `998244353`.\n\nThe modulo is a prime number.\nWe need to compute binomial coefficients `binom(n-2, k-1)` and powers `k^{k-1}` and `(n-k)^{n-k-1}`.\n`k^{k-1}` needs to be `1` for `k=1`. `(n-k)^{n-k-1}` needs to be `1` for `n-k=1`.\n`pow(x, y, mod)` function handles `y=0` as `1`.\nFor `k=1`, `k-1=0`, so `1^0=1`. This is correct.\nFor `n-k=1`, `n-k-1=0`, so `1^0=1`. This is correct.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  If `n % 2 == 1`, print `0`.\n3.  If `n == 1`, print `0`. (Covered by `n%2==1` for `n>1`, but `d(1,1)=0` is a special case.)\n4.  If `n == 2`, print `-1 % MOD`.\n5.  If `n >= 4` and `n` is even:\n    a.  Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo `MOD` up to `n-2`.\n    b.  Initialize `total_sum = 0`.\n    c.  Loop `k` from `1` to `n-1`:\n        i.   Calculate `term = binom(n-2, k-1) * pow(k, k-1, MOD) * pow(n-k, n-k-1, MOD)`.\n        ii.  If `k` is odd, `total_sum = (total_sum - term + MOD) % MOD`.\n        iii. If `k` is even, `total_sum = (total_sum + term) % MOD`.\n    d.  Print `total_sum`.\n\n**Complexity:**\nPrecomputation: `O(n)`.\nLoop: `n` iterations. Inside the loop: `binom` is `O(1)`, `pow` is `O(log MOD)`.\nTotal complexity: `O(n log MOD)`.\n`n = 5 \\cdot 10^5`. `log MOD` is about `30`.\n`5 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 30 = 1.5 \\cdot 10^7`, which is feasible within 1-2 seconds.\n\n**Modulo arithmetic:**\n`MOD = 998244353`.\nNeed `pow(base, exp, mod)` for modular exponentiation.\nNeed `inv(x, mod)` for modular inverse (using Fermat's Little Theorem: `pow(x, mod-2, mod)`).\nNeed `nCr_mod_p(n, r, fact, inv_fact, mod)` for binomial coefficients.\n\nFinal check on edge cases for powers:\n`k^{k-1}`:\n`k=1`: `1^0 = 1`.\n`k=2`: `2^1 = 2`.\n`(n-k)^{n-k-1}`:\n`n-k=1`: `1^0 = 1`.\n`n-k=2`: `2^1 = 2`.\nThese are handled correctly by `pow(base, exp, mod)` as long as `base` is not `0`.\n`k` is always `1` to `n-1`, so `k` and `n-k` are always positive.\nThe maximum value of `n-2` is `5 \\cdot 10^5 - 2`. Max `k-1` is `n-2`. Max `k` is `n-1`. Max `n-k` is `n-1`.\nAll values are within reasonable limits for standard integer types before modulo.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    MOD = 998244353\n\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    if n == 1: # n=1 is odd, but d(1,1) is 0 anyway\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(MOD - 1) # d(1,2) = -1\n        return\n\n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n    max_val = n - 2\n    fact = [1] * (max_val + 1)\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_val + 1)\n\n    for i in range(1, max_val + 1):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i-1] * i) % MOD\n\n    inv_fact[max_val] = pow(fact[max_val], MOD - 2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_val - 1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = (inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n\n    def nCr_mod_p(n_val, r_val):\n        if r_val < 0 or r_val > n_val:\n            return 0\n        num = fact[n_val]\n        den = (inv_fact[r_val] * inv_fact[n_val - r_val]) % MOD\n        return (num * den) % MOD\n\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Sum from k=1 to n-1\n    # Note: k^{k-1} means 1 for k=1 (1^0=1)\n    # (n-k)^{n-k-1} means 1 for n-k=1 (1^0=1)\n    # pow(base, 0, MOD) correctly returns 1 for base != 0.\n    # base is k or n-k, which is always >= 1.\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        term_binom = nCr_mod_p(n - 2, k - 1)\n        term_k_pow = pow(k, k - 1, MOD)\n        term_nk_pow = pow(n - k, n - k - 1, MOD)\n        \n        current_term = (term_binom * term_k_pow) % MOD\n        current_term = (current_term * term_nk_pow) % MOD\n\n        if k % 2 == 1: # (-1)^k is -1\n            total_sum = (total_sum - current_term + MOD) % MOD\n        else: # (-1)^k is 1\n            total_sum = (total_sum + current_term) % MOD\n\n    print(total_sum)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
