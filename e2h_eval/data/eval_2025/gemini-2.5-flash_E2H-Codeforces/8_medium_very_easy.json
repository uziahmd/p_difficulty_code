Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on \"Flawed Flow\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Flawed Flow\" problem, and it's all about directing edges in a graph with flow capacities to meet certain criteria. The core idea is to balance the incoming and outgoing flow at each vertex, with the source having no incoming flow and the sink having no outgoing flow. The real challenge is the \"no cycles\" condition, which screams DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) at me. Since a solution is guaranteed to exist, I'm thinking there must be a way to build this flow greedily.\n\n**Breaking Down the Constraints**\n\nLet's dissect the conditions. Flow conservation means any intermediate node has a net flow of zero. The source is a pure origin, and the sink is a pure end-point. I've got to ensure there are no cycles, which feels like a topological sort might be involved. Since it's a DAG, the flow should naturally travel from vertices with a smaller topological rank to those with a larger one.\n\n**Parity and Balancing**\n\nThe flow conservation condition has an implication I'm starting to see clearly: For all intermediate nodes, the total flow must be even to ensure that the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. This could be a vital constraint to exploit!\n\nLet's maintain a \"flow balance\" for each node. Initially, it's zero. When I direct an edge, I update the balances. My goal is to get all intermediate nodes to zero balance. The source will be negative and the sink positive.\n\n**Greedy Traversal and DFS**\n\nMy instinct is to build the flow greedily. Start at the source and keep pushing flow until it meets all constraints, especially the \"no cycles\" condition. It feels like a DFS or a topological sort is the way to go here. I'll need to somehow prevent cycles during this traversal.\n\nI'm thinking of a Depth First Search (DFS) from node 1. I know that since the graph is a DAG, a DFS will not create cycles. It'll follow a path and direct edges along the path from 1, making sure the flow conservation holds.\nThe key insight, if I use a DFS, is to be mindful of intermediate nodes and the flow that's getting in and out, not to mess up the flow balance of nodes I had visited.\n\n**Towards a Solution**\n\nSo, here's my plan of attack. I'll start with a DFS from the source, node 1. The main challenge will be to handle the balance at intermediate nodes, ensuring that their in-flow and out-flow are equal and that the global constraint \"no cycles\" is met. I'll need to ensure that the total flow *into* an intermediate node is always exactly half of the total potential flow, which is always an even number due to the earlier parity argument. Then I continue until I reach the final sink and the problem is done.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to direct each edge `(a_i, b_i)` with a given flow volume `c_i` such that:\n1. For any intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the total incoming flow equals the total outgoing flow.\n2. Vertex 1 (source) has no incoming edges.\n3. The resulting directed graph has no cycles.\n\nA solution is guaranteed to exist.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n- **Flow Conservation (1 < v < n):** `sum(in_flow_v) = sum(out_flow_v)`. This means the net flow at any intermediate vertex is zero.\n- **Source (vertex 1):** No incoming edges. This implies all flow through edges incident to vertex 1 must be outgoing.\n- **Sink (vertex n):** Although not explicitly stated, if the source has only outgoing flow and intermediate vertices conserve flow, then all flow must eventually reach the sink. This implies the sink has only incoming edges (no outgoing edges).\n- **No Cycles:** This is a crucial constraint. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) implies that there is a topological ordering of vertices. Flow must generally go from \"earlier\" vertices to \"later\" vertices in such an ordering.\n\nConsider the \"net flow\" for each vertex. Let `balance[v]` be the sum of flow *into* `v` minus the sum of flow *out of* `v`.\n- For `1 < v < n`, we need `balance[v] = 0`.\n- For `v = 1`, we need `balance[1] = 0` (no incoming flow).\n- For `v = n`, we need `balance[n]` to be the total flow of the network (all flow eventually enters `n`).\n\nLet `total_incident_flow[v]` be the sum of `c_i` for all edges incident to `v`.\nFor an intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), if `sum(in_flow_v) = sum(out_flow_v)`, then `total_incident_flow[v] = sum(in_flow_v) + sum(out_flow_v) = 2 * sum(in_flow_v)`. This implies that `total_incident_flow[v]` must be an even number, and the required incoming flow is `total_incident_flow[v] / 2`.\n\nThis problem can be solved using a Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) starting from the source (vertex 1). The \"no cycles\" constraint simplifies things significantly. Since a solution is guaranteed and the graph is connected, we can process nodes and their incident edges in a way that respects the flow conservation and acyclicity.\n\nLet's maintain `current_balance[v]` for each vertex `v`, representing `sum(incoming_flow) - sum(outgoing_flow)` for edges *already directed*. Initially, all `current_balance[v]` are 0.\nWe also need to store the directions for each edge. Let `ans[edge_idx]` be `0` if the flow is `a_i -> b_i` and `1` if `b_i -> a_i`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Create an adjacency list `adj` where `adj[u]` stores tuples `(v, flow_c, edge_idx)` for all neighbors `v` of `u`. Since the graph is undirected, add `(u, flow_c, edge_idx)` to `adj[v]` as well. Store original `(u, v, c)` for each edge `i` in a list `edges_info` to easily determine `u` and `v` later.\n    *   Initialize `current_balance[v] = 0` for all `v` from 1 to `n`.\n    *   Initialize `ans` array of size `m` with placeholder values.\n    *   Keep track of `visited` nodes to perform a DFS.\n\n2.  **DFS Traversal:**\n    *   Start a DFS from vertex 1: `dfs(u, parent_edge_idx)`. The `parent_edge_idx` is used to identify the edge that brought us to `u`, so we don't try to direct it again from `u`'s perspective.\n    *   Mark `u` as visited.\n    *   For each neighbor `v` of `u` connected by edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)`:\n        *   If `v` is not visited:\n            *   Recursively call `dfs(v, edge_idx)`.\n            *   After the recursive call returns, we need to decide the direction of the edge `(u, v)`. The DFS effectively explores a spanning tree/forest. When `dfs(v)` finishes, it means all edges in the subtree rooted at `v` (that don't lead to already visited nodes) have been processed.\n            *   At this point, `current_balance[v]` reflects the net flow for `v` considering all edges *within its subtree* and edges connecting `v` to `n`.\n            *   For an intermediate node `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), its `current_balance[v]` must eventually be 0. If `current_balance[v]` is non-zero, it means `v` has an excess or deficit of flow that must be balanced by the edge `(u, v)`.\n            *   **If `current_balance[v]` is 0:** This means `v` has already balanced its internal flow requirements (or it's the sink `n` and its flow is fully accounted for from its children). In this case, to maintain acyclicity and flow from source to sink, we direct `u -> v`. This means `current_balance[u]` decreases by `c`, and `current_balance[v]` increases by `c`. (Note: `current_balance[v]` was 0, now it becomes `c`. This is fine because `v` will eventually pass this `c` flow further down, or if `v=n`, it's an incoming flow).\n                `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (flow `u -> v`)\n                `current_balance[u] -= c`\n                `current_balance[v] += c`\n            *   **If `current_balance[v]` is non-zero:** This means `v` needs to either receive more flow or send out more flow to reach its target balance (0 for intermediate nodes). Specifically, `current_balance[v]` represents `(inflow - outflow)`. If `current_balance[v] != 0`, it means `v` has an unbalanced flow that must be handled by the edge `(u,v)`.\n                To achieve `balance[v]=0` for `1 < v < n`, we must direct the edge `(u, v)` such that `current_balance[v]` becomes 0.\n                Since `current_balance[v]` is already `sum(in_flow_children) - sum(out_flow_children)`, if `current_balance[v]` is positive, `v` has a surplus of incoming flow. To balance it, `v` must send this surplus out via `u`. So, `v -> u`.\n                If `current_balance[v]` is negative, `v` has a deficit of incoming flow. To balance it, `v` must receive this deficit from `u`. So, `u -> v`.\n                However, this logic is slightly flawed. The problem constraints (`v=1` no incoming, `v=n` no outgoing, no cycles) imply that flow must generally go away from `1` and towards `n`. A simpler approach for the DFS is:\n                When `dfs(v)` returns, `current_balance[v]` holds the net flow *into* `v` from its children. If `v` is an intermediate node (1 < `v` < `n`), it should ideally have `current_balance[v] = 0`. If `current_balance[v]` is non-zero, this means `v` needs to send this net flow *up* to `u` or receive it *from* `u` to satisfy its own balance.\n                Specifically, if `current_balance[v]` is positive, `v` has an excess of incoming flow from its children. It must send this excess `current_balance[v]` up to `u`. So, we direct `v -> u`.\n                If `current_balance[v]` is negative, `v` has a deficit of incoming flow. This implies it needs `abs(current_balance[v])` flow. This flow must come from `u`. So, we direct `u -> v`.\n                In both cases, we want to update `current_balance[u]` and `current_balance[v]` to reflect this choice.\n                The edge `(u, v)` has flow `c`.\n                If `current_balance[v]` is non-zero:\n                    Direct `v -> u`. This means `current_balance[v]` decreases by `c` (as it's now outgoing) and `current_balance[u]` increases by `c` (as it's now incoming).\n                    `ans[edge_idx] = 1` (flow `v -> u`)\n                    `current_balance[v] -= c`\n                    `current_balance[u] += c`\n                The crucial part is that `current_balance[v]` should become 0 after this. So, `current_balance[v]` must be equal to `c` for this to work.\n                This logic is still not quite right.\n                \nLet's refine the DFS approach based on the \"no cycles\" and \"source/sink\" properties.\nA common strategy for DAGs is to process nodes in topological order, or to use a DFS that accumulates information from children to parent.\nThe `current_balance[v]` should reflect the *net flow out* of `v`. So `current_balance[v] = sum(out_flow) - sum(in_flow)`.\nInitially, `current_balance[v] = 0`.\nWhen we direct `X -> Y` with flow `c`:\n`current_balance[X] += c`\n`current_balance[Y] -= c`\n\n**Revised DFS:**\n`dfs(u, p)`:\n  `visited[u] = True`\n  For each neighbor `v` of `u` with edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)`:\n    If `v` is visited and `v` is not `p` (parent in DFS tree), it means we found a back-edge or cross-edge. Since no cycles are allowed in the final graph, this edge must be directed `v -> u`. (This is a simplified assumption for a general DAG construction, but for this problem, it's more about how `current_balance` is handled).\n    However, a simpler approach is to only process unvisited neighbors.\n    If `v` is not visited:\n      `dfs(v, u)`\n      // After `dfs(v)` returns, `current_balance[v]` represents the net flow *out* of `v` from its subtree.\n      // For `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), we need `current_balance[v]` to be 0 at the end.\n      // If `current_balance[v]` is non-zero, it means `v` has an excess/deficit of outgoing flow.\n      // This excess/deficit must be balanced by the edge `(u, v)`.\n      // If `current_balance[v] > 0`: `v` has an excess of outgoing flow. This flow must have come *from* `u`. So, `u -> v`.\n      // If `current_balance[v] < 0`: `v` has a deficit of outgoing flow. This deficit must be sent *to* `u`. So, `v -> u`.\n      // This is incorrect. `current_balance[v]` is `sum(outgoing) - sum(incoming)`.\n      // If `current_balance[v] != 0`, it needs to be balanced.\n      // If `current_balance[v]` is `X` (value after processing children), and we want it to be `0`.\n      // If `X > 0`, `v` has `X` more outgoing flow than incoming flow from its children. It needs `X` more incoming flow. So, `u -> v`.\n      // If `X < 0`, `v` has `|X|` more incoming flow than outgoing flow from its children. It needs `|X|` more outgoing flow. So, `v -> u`.\n      // The flow on edge `(u, v)` is `c`.\n      // If `current_balance[v] != 0`:\n      //   We must direct the edge `(u, v)` such that `current_balance[v]` becomes `0`.\n      //   This means the edge `(u, v)` must carry `current_balance[v]` flow *into* `v` if `current_balance[v]` is positive, or `current_balance[v]` flow *out of* `v` if `current_balance[v]` is negative.\n      //   This is equivalent to saying: if `current_balance[v]` is not 0, direct `u -> v` if `current_balance[v]` is positive, and `v -> u` if `current_balance[v]` is negative.\n      //   No, this is still confusing.\n\nLet's use the `current_balance[v]` as `sum(incoming_flow) - sum(outgoing_flow)`.\nFor `1 < v < n`, target `current_balance[v] = 0`.\nFor `v = 1`, target `current_balance[1] = 0`.\nFor `v = n`, target `current_balance[n] = total_flow_into_sink`.\n\nThe actual logic for the DFS:\n`dfs(u, p)`:\n  `visited[u] = True`\n  For each neighbor `v` of `u` with edge `(u, v, c, edge_idx)`:\n    If `v` is not visited:\n      `dfs(v, u)`\n      // After `dfs(v)` returns, `current_balance[v]` contains the net flow for `v` from its subtree.\n      // If `v` is not the sink (`n`), its `current_balance[v]` must ultimately be 0.\n      // The edge `(u, v)` is the only way for `v` to balance its flow with `u`.\n      // If `current_balance[v]` is non-zero, it means `v` has an excess of incoming flow (if positive) or an excess of outgoing flow (if negative) from its children.\n      // To balance `v` to 0, we must direct the edge `(u, v)`:\n      // If `current_balance[v] > 0`: `v` has a net incoming flow from its children.
