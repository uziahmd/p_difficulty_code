For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I need to write a Python script, so the first thing is to translate these musical concepts into a form the computer understands. I need to take a set of three notes (a triad) and label it as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange.\"\n\nThe notes are represented by their names, which is human-readable, but I need a numerical representation for easy semitone calculations. So, I'll create a dictionary that maps each note name (C, C#, D, etc.) to a number between 0 and 11. C will be 0, C# is 1, and so on.\n\nNext, I need a way to calculate the distance between any two notes in semitones, even when they wrap around the octave. Given two notes, say `n1` and `n2` I can calculate the distance from `n1` to `n2` *upwards* with the formula `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. This handles the cyclic nature of the notes.\n\nThen, I'll need to read the input triad as note names, convert those names to their integer equivalents using the dictionary I just created, and store them in a list or a tuple.\n\nThe core of the problem is figuring out if a triad is major, minor, or something else. I know a major triad has a specific interval pattern (4, 3 semitones), and a minor triad has a different pattern (3, 4 semitones). However, since the input is an *unordered set* of notes, I need to try all possible permutations of the three input notes. With three notes, there are six permutations (3 factorial). I'll calculate all the distances between each pair in all those permutations and check them against the patterns for major and minor triads. The problem states the output will be unambiguous, so there's no need to handle the (hopefully) rare case of both major and minor being applicable.\n",
