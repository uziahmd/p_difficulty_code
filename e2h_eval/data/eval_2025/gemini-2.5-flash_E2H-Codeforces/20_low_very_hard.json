For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown: Counting Beautiful Multisets**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at a competitive programming problem that boils down to counting the ways to assign values, `c_s`, to binary strings to meet a specific criterion.  The core of the problem is figuring out the maximum size of a \"beautiful multiset\" and ensuring that maximum size is exactly `f`.  The values, `c_s`, for each string `s` of length 1 to `n` have to fall between 0 and `k`.\n\nThe \"beautiful multiset\" condition is the heart of the problem.  Essentially, for any prefix `s` of a string in the multiset, the number of strings that start with that prefix, `N(s)`, can't exceed the corresponding `c_s`.  This sounds a lot like constraints on paths in a tree, particularly a binary tree where the nodes are binary strings, and edges represent string extension.  Strings of length `n` are leaves.\n\nThe key is finding the maximum size of a beautiful multiset, `S_max`.  I suspect the relationship between `N(s)` for a string `s` and its children (`s0`, `s1`) will be crucial. For a string of length less than `n`, `N(s)` is the sum of its child counts, `N(s0) + N(s1)`.  The total size of the multiset is the sum of leaf node counts. This also corresponds to the empty string, and the total count.\n\nThe prefix constraints are the key here.  For any prefix, the maximum number of descendent strings can't exceed the `c_s` value for that prefix. This seems like a constraint satisfaction problem, and potentially solvable with dynamic programming given the tree-like structure. The total size must equal `f`.  I need to figure out how to iterate through all possible `c_s` values and determine whether the resulting maximum multiset size is exactly `f`. My solution will probably involve counting and constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers $c_s$ for all binary strings $s$ of length from $1$ to $n$ (where $0 \\le c_s \\le k$) such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of binary strings of length $n$ is exactly $f$.\n\nLet $S_{max}$ be the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. A multiset $M$ is beautiful if for every binary string $s$ (length $1$ to $n$), the count of strings in $M$ having $s$ as a prefix, denoted $N(s)$, does not exceed $c_s$.\n\nThe total size of the multiset is $\\sum_{s \\text{ of length } n} N(s)$. This is also $N(\\text{empty string})$, if we consider the empty string as the root of the binary tree of all strings.\nThe constraints $N(s) \\le c_s$ define an upper bound on the count of strings under $s$.\nFor any string $s$ of length $L < n$, $N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)$.\nThis implies that $N(s) \\le c_s$ must hold for $s$, and also $N(s0) \\le c_{s0}$ and $N(s1) \\le c_{s1}$.\nThe maximum possible value for $N(s)$ is $min(c_s, \\text{max_descendants}(s))$, where $\\text{max_descendants}(s)$ is the maximum possible sum of counts for strings under $s$.\nThis structure implies that $S_{max}$ is determined by a recursive formula. Let $dp[s]$ be the maximum possible count of strings under $s$.\nFor a leaf node $s$ (length $n$), $dp[s] = c_s$.\nFor an internal node $s$ (length $L < n$), $dp[s] = \\min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])$.\nThe total maximum size $S_{max}$ is $\\min(c_{\\epsilon}, dp[\\epsilon 0] + dp[\\epsilon 1])$ if we define $c_{\\epsilon}$ as infinity, or more generally, $dp[\\epsilon 0] + dp[\\epsilon 1]$ where $\\epsilon$ is the empty string.\nThe problem states $c_s$ are for strings of length $1$ to $n$. The total count is $N(\\text{empty string})$.\nLet's define $dp[L][v]$ as the maximum possible sum of counts of strings of length $n$ that are descendants of the binary string represented by value $v$ at depth $L$.\nFor $L=n$, $dp[n][v] = c_v$.\nFor $L < n$, $dp[L][v] = \\min(c_v, dp[L+1][2v] + dp[L+1][2v+1])$.\nThe total maximum size $S_{max}$ is $dp[0][0]$ (if we imagine a root at depth 0, representing the empty string, and $c_{\\text{empty}}$ is effectively infinite).\nThis means $S_{max} = \\min(c_0, dp[1][0]) + \\min(c_1, dp[1][1])$ where $dp[1][0]$ is the max value for strings under '0', and $dp[1][1]$ for strings under '1'.\nNo, this is incorrect. The total sum is $N(\\text{empty string})$. The root has two children, '0' and '1'. The total count is $N('0') + N('1')$.\nSo $S_{max} = \\text{max_count}(\\text{'0'}) + \\text{max_count}(\\text{'1'})$.\nLet $dp[L][val]$ be the maximum count of strings under the string $s$ represented by $(L, val)$.\n$dp[L][val] = \\min(c_{s}, dp[L+1][val \\cdot 2] + dp[L+1][val \\cdot 2 + 1])$.\nBase case: $dp[n][val] = c_s$.\nThe total $S_{max} = dp[0][\\text{empty string node}]$.\nLet's simplify. All strings at the same depth $L$ behave identically in terms of structure.\nLet $S_L(X)$ be the maximum sum of counts for descendants of a string $s$ of length $L$, given that $c_s = X$.\n$S_n(X) = X$.\n$S_L(X) = \\min(X, S_{L+1}(c_{s0}) + S_{L+1}(c_{s1}))$.\nWait, $c_{s0}$ and $c_{s1}$ are chosen independently for each string.\nAll strings $s$ of length $L$ have $2^{n-L}$ leaves under them.\nThe problem is that for each string $s$, we choose $c_s$. There are $2^1 + 2^2 + \\dots + 2^n = 2(2^n-1)$ such strings. For $n=15$, this is $2(2^{15}-1) \\approx 65534$ strings. Choosing $c_s$ from $0$ to $k$ for each is $(k+1)^{65534}$ ways, which is too large.\n\nThe key observation is that the structure of the problem is symmetric for all strings of the same length.\nLet $x_L$ be the value $\\min(c_s, \\text{sum of children's max counts})$ for a string $s$ of length $L$.\n$x_n = c_s$.\n$x_L = \\min(c_s, x_{L+1}^{(0)} + x_{L+1}^{(1)})$, where $x_{L+1}^{(0)}$ and $x_{L+1}^{(1)}$ are the values for its children $s0$ and $s1$.\nThe total $S_{max}$ is $x_0$.\nThe maximum possible value for $S_{max}$ is $k \\cdot 2^0 = k$.\nThe maximum possible value for $x_L$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nLet $S_L$ be the maximum possible value for $x_L$ if all $c_s$ values for descendants are chosen optimally (up to $k$).\n$S_L = k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nThe maximum possible value for $S_{max}$ is $k \\cdot 2^n$.\nThe given $f$ can be up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$. For $n=15$, $k=2 \\cdot 10^5$, $2^n = 32768$. $k \\cdot 2^n \\approx 6.5 \\cdot 10^9$. So $f$ is much smaller than the maximum possible value.\n\nLet $dp[L][\\text{current_max_sum}]$ be the number of ways to set $c_s$ values for all strings $s'$ of length $L$ and their descendants such that the sum of maximum counts for these $2^L$ strings is $\\text{current_max_sum}$. This is not quite right.\nWe need to count ways to choose $c_s$ values.\nLet $dp[L][X]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s'$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a specific string $s$ of length $L-1$, such that the maximum count for $s$ itself is $X$.\nThis is a standard DP approach for this kind of tree problem.\nLet $dp[L][X]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ values to all strings $s'$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of an arbitrary string $s$ of length $L-1$, such that the maximum count for $s$ is $X$.\nBase case: $L=n$. For a string $s$ of length $n-1$, its children are $s0$ and $s1$. The max count for $s0$ is $c_{s0}$, and for $s1$ is $c_{s1}$.\nSo $dp[n][X]$ is the number of ways to choose $c_{s0}$ and $c_{s1}$ such that $\\min(c_s, c_{s0} + c_{s1})$ (where $s$ is the string of length $n-1$) is $X$.\nNo, let $dp[L][X]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s'$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of an arbitrary string $s$ of length $L-1$, such that if we calculate $x_L$ for $s$ using these $c_{s'}$ values, it evaluates to $X$.\nThe $c_s$ for $s$ itself is not part of this $dp[L][X]$ calculation.\nLet $dp[L][X]$ be the number of ways to choose values $c_{s'}$ for all strings $s'$ of length $L$ to $n$ that are descendants of a specific string $P$ of length $L-1$, such that the maximum total count that can be made from $P$'s children (i.e. for $P0$ and $P1$) is $X$.\nThe maximum total count for $P$ is then $\\min(c_P, X)$.\n\nLet $f_L[X]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_{s'}$ for strings $s'$ of length $L$ to $n$ that are descendants of a string $s$ of length $L-1$, such that the maximum possible count for string $s$ (if $c_s$ were infinite) is $X$.\nFor $L=n$: A string $s$ of length $n-1$ has two children $s0, s1$ of length $n$. We need to choose $c_{s0}$ and $c_{s1}$. The maximum count for $s0$ is $c_{s0}$, for $s1$ is $c_{s1}$. The sum is $c_{s0}+c_{s1}$.\nSo $f_n[X]$ is the number of pairs $(c_{s0}, c_{s1})$ such that $0 \\le c_{s0}, c_{s1} \\le k$ and $c_{s0}+c_{s1}=X$.\nThis is $X+1$ for $0 \\le X \\le k$, and $2k-X+1$ for $k < X \\le 2k$.\nThe maximum value for $X$ is $2k$.\n$f_n[X] = \\max(0, \\min(X+1, 2k-X+1))$.\n\nFor $L < n$: To compute $f_L[X]$, we consider a string $s$ of length $L-1$. It has children $s0, s1$ of length $L$.\nWe need to choose $c_{s0}$ and $c_{s1}$ (from $0$ to $k$).\nFor each choice of $c_{s0}$, the maximum count for $s0$ is $x_0 = \\min(c_{s0}, \\text{max_descendants}(s0))$.\nFor each choice of $c_{s1}$, the maximum count for $s1$ is $x_1 = \\min(c_{s1}, \\text{max_descendants}(s1))$.\nThe sum is $x_0 + x_1$.\nThe number of ways to get $x_0=A$ for $s0$ (given $c_{s0}$) is $f_{L+1}[A]$ (if $c_{s0}$ is chosen properly).\nThis is tricky. Let's redefine.\nLet $dp[L][X]$ be the number of ways to assign $c_s$ values for all strings $s'$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of a specific string $s$ of length $L-1$, such that the expression $x_s = \\min(c_s, x_{s0} + x_{s1})$ evaluates to $X$.\nThis also doesn't work directly because $c_s$ is chosen for $s$ itself.\n\nLet $g[L][X]$ be the number of ways to choose $c_s$ for all strings $s'$ of length $L, \\dots, n$ that are descendants of *any* string $s$ of length $L-1$, such that the maximum possible value that can be obtained from $s$ (i.e., $\\min(c_s, \\text{max_from_children_of_s})$) is $X$.\nFor $L=n$: We are considering a string $s$ of length $n-1$. Its children are $s0, s1$. These are leaves.\nWe need to choose $c_{s0}, c_{s1}, c_s$.\nThe maximum for $s0$ is $c_{s0}$. The maximum for $s1$ is $c_{s1}$.\nThe maximum for $s$ is $\\min(c_s, c_{s0} + c_{s1})$. We want this to be $X$.\nFor a fixed $X$, we need to sum over all possible $c_s \\in [0, k]$ and $c_{s0}, c_{s1} \\in [0, k]$ such that $\\min(c_s, c_{s0}+c_{s1}) = X$.\nThis means $c_s \\ge X$ AND $c_{s0}+c_{s1} \\ge X$ AND ($c_s=X$ OR $c_{s0}+c_{s1}=X$).\nLet $S = c_{s0}+c_{s1}$. The number of ways to get $S$ is $f_n[S]$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ such that $c_s \\ge X$ is $k-X+1$.\nThe number of ways to choose $c_s$ such that $c_s = X$ is $1$.\nSo, $g[n][X] = (\\sum_{S=X+1}^{2k} f_n[S] \\cdot 1) + (f_n[X] \\cdot (k-X+1))$.\nThe sum $\\sum_{S=X+1}^{2k} f_n[S]$ is the number of ways to get $c_{s0}+c_{s1} > X$.\n$f_n[X]$ is the number of ways to get $c_{s0}+c_{s1} = X$.\nSo $g[n][X] = \\sum_{S=X+1}^{2k} f_n[S] + f_n[X] \\cdot (k-X+1)$.\nThis is equivalent to:\n$g[n][X] = \\sum_{S=X}^{2k} f_n[S] \\cdot (\\text{number of } c_s \\text{ s.t. } c_s \\ge X \\text{ and } \\min(c_s, S) = X)$.\nIf $S > X$, we need $c_s = X$. (1 way)\nIf $S = X$, we need $c_s \\ge X$. ($k-X+1$ ways)\nSo $g[n][X] = \\sum_{S=X+1}^{2k} f_n[S] \\cdot 1 + f_n[X] \\cdot (k-X+1)$.\nThe maximum possible value for $X$ is $k$. So $g[n]$ has size $k+1$.\n$f_n[S]$ is defined up to $2k$.\nLet $P_n[X] = \\sum_{j=X}^{2k} f_n[j]$. This is prefix sums (suffix sums).\nThen $g[n][X] = P_n[X+1] + f_n[X] \\cdot (k-X+1)$.\n\nFor $L < n$: We are considering a string $s$ of length $L-1$. Its children are $s0, s1$ of length $L$.\nWe need to choose $c_s$ (from $0$ to $k$) and assign $c_{s'}$ for all descendants $s'$ of $s0$ and $s1$.\nThe maximum count for $s0$ will be $X_0$. The number of ways to achieve this is $g[L][X_0]$.\nThe maximum count for $s1$ will be $X_1$. The number of ways to achieve this is $g[L][X_1]$.\nThe maximum count for $s$ will be $\\min(c_s, X_0+X_1)$. We want this to be $X$.\n$g[L-1][X] = \\sum_{X_0=0}^{k \\cdot 2^{n-L}} \\sum_{X_1=0}^{k \\cdot 2^{n-L}} g[L][X_0] \\cdot g[L][X_1] \\cdot (\\text{ways to choose } c_s \\text{ s.t. } \\min(c_s, X_0+X_1) = X)$.\nThe maximum value for $X_0$ or $X_1$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nThe maximum value for $X_0+X_1$ is $2k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nLet $S = X_0+X_1$. Let $h[L][S]$ be $\\sum_{X_0+X_1=S} g[L][X_0] \\cdot g[L][X_1]$. This is a convolution.\n$h[L][S] = (g[L] * g[L])[S]$.\nThen $g[L-1][X] = \\sum_{S=X+1}^{2k \\cdot 2^{n-L}} h[L][S] \\cdot 1 + h[L][X] \\cdot (k-X+1)$.\nThe maximum value for $X$ for $g[L-1]$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-(L-1)}$.\nThe maximum value for $X$ for $g[L]$ is $k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nThe maximum value for $X$ for $g[0]$ (the overall $S_{max}$) is $k \\cdot 2^n$. This is $2^n$ times $k$.\nThe $X$ values range up to $k \\cdot 2^{n-L+1}$.\nThe $h[L][S]$ values range up to $2k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\nThe final answer is $g[0][f]$.\n\nLet $DP[L]$ be the array $g[L][\\cdot]$.\nMax value for $X$ at level $L$: $M_L = k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$.\n$DP[n]$ is computed first.\n$f_n[S]$ calculation: $S$ from $0$ to $2k$. This takes $O(k)$ time.\n$P_n[X]$ calculation: $X$ from $0$ to $2k$. This takes $O(k)$ time.\n$DP[n][X]$ calculation: $X$ from $0$ to $k$. This takes $O(k)$ time.\nSize of $DP[n]$ is $k+1$. Max value $M_n = k$.\n\nFor $L$ from $n$ down to $1$:\n1. Compute $h[L][S] = (DP[L] * DP[L])[S]$. Max $S$ is $2 \\cdot M_L$. Size of $DP[L]$ is $M_L+1$.\n   Convolution takes $O(M_L^2)$ time or $O(M_L \\log M_L)$ with FFT/NTT.\n   Since $M_L = k \\cdot 2^{n-L}$, $M_L$ can be up to $k \\cdot 2^{n-1}$.\n   For $L=1$, $M_1 = k \\cdot 2^{n-1}$. $M_1^2 = (k \\cdot 2^{n-1})^2$.\n   $n=15, k=2 \\cdot 10^5$. $M_1 \\approx 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 2^{14} \\approx 3.2 \\cdot 10^9$. This is too large for $M_L^2$ or even $M_L \\log M_L$.\n   The actual $f$ is up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$. This implies that the relevant range for $X$ is much smaller.\n\nThe maximum value for $X$ is $f$. So we only need to compute $DP[L][X]$ for $X \\le f$.\nLet $M_L = \\min(f, k \\cdot 2^{n-L})$.\nFor $L=n$: $M_n = \\min(f, k)$.\n$f_n[S]$ for $S \\le \\min(2k, f)$.\n$DP[n][X]$ for $X \\le M_n$.\nThe convolution $(DP[L] * DP[L])$ needs to be computed only up to $S \\le f$.\nSo $h[L][S]$ for $S \\le f$.\nThe size of $DP[L]$ is $M_L+1$.\nThe size of $h[L]$ is $f+1$.\nA convolution of two polynomials of degree $D_1, D_2$ results in a polynomial of degree $D_1+D_2$. If we only need coefficients up to $D_{res}$, we can do it in $O(D_1 D_2)$ naively, or $O((D_1+D_2) \\log (D_1+D_2))$ with NTT.\nHere, $D_1 = D_2 = M_L$. We need $h[L][S]$ for $S \\le f$.\nIf $2M_L < f$, we need to compute the full convolution up to $2M_L$.\nIf $2M_L \\ge f$, we only need to compute up to $f$.\nThe naive convolution for $D_1, D_2$ up to $f$ is $O(f^2)$.\nThe total time complexity would be $O(n \\cdot f^2)$.\n$n=15, f=2 \\cdot 10^5$. $15 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10^5)^2 = 15 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 10^{10} = 6 \\cdot 10^{11}$. Still too slow.\nWith NTT, $O(n \\cdot f \\log f)$. $15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log(2 \\cdot 10^5) \\approx 15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 18 \\approx 5.4 \\cdot 10^7$. This is feasible.\n\nModulo is $998244353$, which is a prime suitable for NTT.\n\nLet's trace the maximum values for $X$ more carefully.\n$DP[L]$ stores counts for max sums up to $\\min(f, k \\cdot 2^{n-L})$.\n$DP[n]$: $X$ up to $\\min(f, k)$. Let $MAX\\_X_n = \\min(f, k)$.\n$DP[n][X]$ for $X \\in [0, MAX\\_X_n]$.\n$h[n][S]$: $S = X_0+X_1$. $X_0, X_1 \\in [0, MAX\\_X_n]$. So $S \\in [0, 2 \\cdot MAX\\_X_n]$.\nWe only need $h[n][S]$ for $S \\in [0, \\min(f, 2 \\cdot MAX\\_X_n)]$.\n$DP[n-1]$: $X$ up to $\\min(f, k \\cdot 2^1)$. Let $MAX\\_X_{n-1} = \\min(f, k \\cdot 2^1)$.\n$DP[n-1][X]$ for $X \\in [0, MAX\\_X_{n-1}]$.\nThis means the convolution $h[L][S]$ needs to be computed for $S \\in [0, \\min(f, 2 \\cdot MAX\\_X_L)]$.\nThe size of the arrays for NTT will be $2^{\\lceil \\log_2(\\min(f, 2 \\cdot MAX\\_X_L) + 1) \\rceil}$.\nThe maximum value of $2 \\cdot MAX\\_X_L$ is $2f$.
