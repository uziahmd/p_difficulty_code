Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Strategic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\" problem. My goal is to write a Python script to find three vertices in a regular n-gon that form an angle closest to a given target angle 'a'. It's all about minimizing the absolute difference between the actual angle and the target angle.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the problem. We're dealing with a regular, convex n-gon, so all the vertices sit neatly on a circumcircle. The key is understanding how angles within the polygon relate to the central angles and arc lengths. I know that an inscribed angle (the angle formed by three vertices, like v1-v2-v3) is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc. That's a crucial geometric insight.\n\nI'm thinking, let's fix one vertex, say vertex 1 (P1), as the vertex of the angle (v2). We can always rotate the polygon later, so it's fine to assume this. I'll represent the other two vertices, v1 and v3, as Pj and Pk respectively, where their positions are defined in relation to P1. The challenge is figuring out the relationship between the positions of Pj and Pk (the number of sides between them) and the resulting angle.\n\nI initially thought the angle might be directly related to the number of sides between Pj and Pk multiplied by 180/n, but something feels off about that.\n\nI'm starting to remember that the total angle sum of an n-gon isn't directly relevant here. I'll need to focus on how an arc, defined by vertices Pj and Pk, directly corresponds to the angle PjP1Pk. Let me re-evaluate based on the circumcircle property and the inscribed angle theorem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular n-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` is as close as possible to a given target angle `a`.\n\n**Key Geometric Property:**\nIn a regular n-gon, all vertices lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `P_j P_i P_k` (where `P_i` is the vertex of the angle) is an inscribed angle. The measure of such an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the arc `P_j P_k` (the arc not containing `P_i`).\n\nThe central angle between two adjacent vertices in a regular n-gon is `360 / n` degrees.\nIf the arc `P_j P_k` spans `k` sides (i.e., `k` edges of the polygon), then the central angle subtended by this arc is `k * (360 / n)` degrees.\nTherefore, the inscribed angle `P_j P_i P_k` will be `(1/2) * k * (360 / n) = k * (180 / n)` degrees.\n\nHere, `k` represents the number of vertices *between* `P_j` and `P_k` along the arc, plus one (for the segment `P_j P_k` itself). More precisely, if we fix `P_i` as vertex 1, and `P_j` and `P_k` are `x` and `y` steps away from `P_i` in opposite directions along the perimeter (or `x` and `y` steps away in the same direction, with `x < y`), then `k` is simply the difference in their indices (modulo `n`).\n\nLet's fix `v2` as vertex 2 (arbitrary choice, any vertex works due to symmetry).\nLet `v1` be vertex 1.\nThen `v3` can be any vertex from 3 to `n`.\nIf `v2` is vertex 2 and `v1` is vertex 1, then the angle `1-2-v3` intercepts the arc from vertex 1 to `v3`.\nThe number of sides `k` between vertex 1 and vertex `v3` (along the arc not containing vertex 2) is `v3 - 1`.\nSo, the angle `1-2-v3` would be `(v3 - 1) * (180 / n)`.\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= n-2` (because `v1, v2, v3` must be distinct, so `v3` cannot be `v1` or `v2`).\nThe possible angles are `1 * (180 / n)`, `2 * (180 / n)`, ..., `(n-2) * (180 / n)`.\nWe want to find `k` such that `|k * (180 / n) - a|` is minimized.\n\nLet `angle_unit = 180 / n`.\nWe are looking for `k` that minimizes `|k * angle_unit - a|`.\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` that minimizes `|k - a / angle_unit|`.\nLet `target_k_float = a / angle_unit`.\nThe best integer `k` will be either `floor(target_k_float)` or `ceil(target_k_float)`.\nWe need to check both `k_floor = floor(target_k_float)` and `k_ceil = ceil(target_k_float)`.\nAlso, `k` must be within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `a`.\n2.  Calculate `angle_unit = 180 / n`.\n3.  Calculate `target_k_float = a / angle_unit`.\n4.  Initialize `min_diff = float('inf')` and `best_k = -1`.\n5.  Consider `k_candidates = [int(target_k_float), int(target_k_float) + 1]`.\n6.  For each `k_val` in `k_candidates`:\n    a.  Check if `1 <= k_val <= n-2`. If not, skip this `k_val`.\n    b.  Calculate `current_angle = k_val * angle_unit`.\n    c.  Calculate `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    d.  If `diff < min_diff`:\n        i.  `min_diff = diff`\n        ii. `best_k = k_val`\n    e.  If `diff == min_diff` and `k_val` is smaller than `best_k` (or any other tie-breaking rule, problem says any optimal solution is fine, so just picking the first one found or smaller `k_val` is fine):\n        i.  `best_k = k_val` (This specific tie-breaking isn't strictly necessary but ensures deterministic output).\n7.  Once `best_k` is found:\n    *   `v2` can be fixed as vertex 2.\n    *   `v1` can be fixed as vertex 1.\n    *   `v3` will be `v1 + best_k = 1 + best_k`.\n8.  Print `v1, v2, v3`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=67):**\n1.  `n=4, a=67`\n2.  `angle_unit = 180 / 4 = 45`\n3.  `target_k_float = 67 / 45 = 1.488...`\n4.  `k_candidates = [1, 2]`\n5.  Valid range for `k`: `[1, n-2] = [1, 4-2] = [1, 2]`. Both candidates are valid.\n6.  For `k_val = 1`:\n    a.  Valid.\n    b.  `current_angle = 1 * 45 = 45`.\n    c.  `diff = abs(45 - 67) = 22`.\n    d.  `min_diff = 22`, `best_k = 1`.\n7.  For `k_val = 2`:\n    a.  Valid.\n    b.  `current_angle = 2 * 45 = 90`.\n    c.  `diff = abs(90 - 67) = 23`.\n    d.  `diff (23)` is not less than `min_diff (22)`.\n8.  `best_k = 1`.\n9.  `v1 = 1`, `v2 = 2`, `v3 = 1 + best_k = 1 + 1 = 2`. This is incorrect, `v3` must be distinct from `v2`.\n\n**Correction for Vertex Assignment:**\nIf `v2` is vertex `P_i`, and `v1` and `v3` are `P_j` and `P_k`, the angle `P_j P_i P_k` intercepts the arc `P_j P_k`. The number of sides in this arc is `k`.\nLet's fix `v2` as vertex 2.\nLet `v1` be vertex 1.\nThen `v3` must be `2 + k`.\nThe vertices are `P_1, P_2, ..., P_n`.\nIf `v2` is `P_2`, `v1` is `P_1`.\nThen `v3` must be `P_{2+k}`.\nThe angle `P_1 P_2 P_{2+k}` intercepts the arc `P_1 P_{2+k}`.\nThe number of sides in this arc is `(2+k) - 1 = k+1`.\nSo the angle would be `(k+1) * (180 / n)`. This is not `k * (180 / n)`.\n\nLet's use a simpler assignment:\nFix `v2` as vertex 1.\nThen `v1` can be vertex 2.\nThen `v3` must be vertex `2 + k`.\nThe angle `P_2 P_1 P_{2+k}` intercepts the arc `P_2 P_{2+k}`.\nThe number of sides in this arc is `(2+k) - 2 = k`.\nSo, the angle is `k * (180 / n)`.\nThis setup works!\n`v1 = 2`\n`v2 = 1`\n`v3 = 2 + best_k` (modulo `n`, handling wrap-around if `2+best_k > n`)\nSince `best_k` is at most `n-2`, `2+best_k` is at most `2 + n - 2 = n`.\nSo `v3` will always be `2 + best_k`.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and `a`.\n2.  Calculate `angle_unit = 180 / n`.\n3.  Calculate `target_k_float = a / angle_unit`.\n4.  Initialize `min_diff = float('inf')` and `best_k = -1`.\n5.  Iterate `k_val` from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive):\n    a.  Calculate `current_angle = k_val * angle_unit`.\n    b.  Calculate `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    c.  If `diff < min_diff`:\n        i.  `min_diff = diff`\n        ii. `best_k = k_val`\n    d.  If `diff == min_diff` and `k_val < best_k`: (prefer smaller `k` for tie-breaking, though any is fine)\n        i.  `best_k = k_val`\n6.  Print `2`, `1`, `(2 + best_k)`. (These are `v1, v2, v3` respectively in the problem statement's `v1, v2, v3` order.)\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=67) with corrected assignment:**\n1.  `n=4, a=67`\n2.  `angle_unit = 180 / 4 = 45`\n3.  `target_k_float = 67 / 45 = 1.488...`\n4.  Loop `k_val` from 1 to `n-2 = 2`.\n    *   `k_val = 1`:\n        *   `current_angle = 1 * 45 = 45`.\n        *   `diff = abs(45 - 67) = 22`.\n        *   `min_diff = 22`, `best_k = 1`.\n    *   `k_val = 2`:\n        *   `current_angle = 2 * 45 = 90`.\n        *   `diff = abs(90 - 67) = 23`.\n        *   `diff` (23) is not less than `min_diff` (22).\n5.  `best_k = 1`.\n6.  Output: `2 1 (2 + 1)` which is `2 1 3`. This matches the example output.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   `n=3`: `k` can only be `1`. `(n-2)=1`. The only possible angle is `1 * (180/3) = 60` degrees.\n    *   Input: `3 15`\n    *   `angle_unit = 180/3 = 60`.\n    *   `target_k_float = 15/60 = 0.25`.\n    *   Loop `k_val` from 1 to 1.\n        *   `k_val = 1`: `current_angle = 60`. `diff = abs(60 - 15) = 45`. `min_diff = 45`, `best_k = 1`.\n    *   Output: `2 1 (2 + 1)` which is `2 1 3`. This matches the example output.\n\nThe loop `for k_val in range(1, n - 1):` covers all possible `k` values from `1` to `n-2`.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^5`, a linear scan for `k` is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    # The vertices are 1 to n.\n    # We fix v2 as vertex 1.\n    # We fix v1 as vertex 2.\n    # Then v3 will be vertex (2 + k), where k is the number of sides in the arc from v1 to v3.\n    # The angle formed by P_v1 P_v2 P_v3 is k * (180 / n).\n    # k must be between 1 and n-2 (inclusive), because v1, v2, v3 must be distinct.\n    # v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+k.\n    # If k=1, v3=3.
