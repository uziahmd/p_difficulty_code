And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Reflecting on Efficient Sleep Time Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to calculate the average sleep time over a series of consecutive days, broken down into \"weeks\" of `k` days each.  Let's see, I've got the total number of days, `n`, the week length `k`, and an array `a` containing the sleep times for each day. The goal is to compute a highly precise average sleep time for all possible `k`-day periods.\n\nMy initial thought is to simply loop through all the possible \"weeks\" and sum their sleep times.  I've realized that the number of weeks is `n - k + 1`. This would mean, for each possible start day `i`, I'd need to sum the sleep times of the `k` days following it. I envision this looking something like:\n\n```python\ntotal_sum_of_weeks = 0\nfor i in range(n - k + 1):\n    current_week_sum = 0\n    for j in range(k):\n        current_week_sum += a[i + j]\n    total_sum_of_weeks += current_week_sum\n\naverage = total_sum_of_weeks / (n - k + 1)\n```\n\nHowever, I'm already anticipating the performance pitfalls of this approach.  Given that `n` can reach up to 200,000, and `k` can be as large as `n`, this nested loop structure screams `O(n^2)` complexity. This is a red flag, as my code could time out quickly, especially if k is closer to n/2.\n\nTherefore, I need to optimize this calculation. I see two potential avenues for this: prefix sums or the sliding window technique. Both strategies are designed to avoid recalculating the same sleep times repeatedly.  With prefix sums, I would precompute cumulative sums up to each day, which would allow me to calculate a week's sum by subtracting two prefix sums. Alternatively, with the sliding window, I'd calculate the first week's sum and then efficiently update it for each subsequent week by subtracting the value that's falling out of the window and adding the new value that's sliding into it. Both methods should lead to a much faster, `O(n)` solution. I'm leaning toward the sliding window as being more intuitive for this specific problem.\n",
