Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Vanya and Cards Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Vanya and Cards\" problem, and here's my thought process on how to efficiently solve it with a Python script.  First, I'm breaking down the problem's core elements to ensure I've got a solid grasp of the requirements. Vanya starts with a set of cards, each holding an integer, and these values are constrained within a specific absolute value limit, `x`. The goal is to figure out the *minimum* number of additional cards he needs to find so that the sum of *all* the cards is exactly zero.\n\nFrom the input, I'll be given the number of cards Vanya already has (`n`), the maximum absolute value (`x`), and the integers on those initial cards.  The crucial part is understanding the constraint: Vanya can acquire as many cards as he needs, and the value on any of those new cards will also fall within the range `[-x, x]`.\n\nMy strategy will involve these key steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the existing total:** I'll start by summing up all the values on the cards Vanya already has. Let's call this sum `current_sum`.\n\n2.  **Determine the required negative balance:** To reach a final sum of zero, the additional cards must contribute an amount equal to the negative of the `current_sum`. Therefore, `target_sum_needed = -current_sum`.\n\n3.  **Focus on the absolute magnitude:** I really care about the magnitude of the number Vanya needs to reach, not the sign. That means I will calculate `abs_target_sum = abs(target_sum_needed)`.\n\n4.  **Maximize contribution per card:** To find the minimum *number* of additional cards, I need to maximize the value that each additional card contributes towards the `abs_target_sum`. Since each card's absolute value is limited to `x`, I'll use cards that will get me closer to zero the quickest.\n\n5.  **Calculate the minimal additional cards:**\n    *   If `abs_target_sum` is zero to begin with, I'm done, and the answer is 0.\n    *   If `abs_target_sum` is positive: I need to determine how many cards, each with an absolute value of at most `x`, are required to reach `abs_target_sum`.  This becomes a simple division problem, but I need to ensure I consider the cases where the target sum is not perfectly divisible by `x`. In Python, I can use the `ceil` function (or integer division with a bit of a tweak: `(a + b - 1) // b`) to ensure I always round up to the nearest whole number of cards needed.\n\nIn essence, I'll calculate the `current_sum`, find the absolute value of the number Vanya needs to add, and divide that by `x`, rounding up to the nearest integer. That's the core of the algorithm!\n",
