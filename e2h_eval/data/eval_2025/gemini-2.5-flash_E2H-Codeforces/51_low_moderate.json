Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"Amusing Joke\" Problem in Python**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Amusing Joke\" problem. Seems like a fairly standard character counting challenge. The input's straightforward: two names and a pile of letters. The goal is to figure out if the pile of letters can be made *exactly* by combining the letters from the two names.\n\nMy immediate thought is, the most efficient way to tackle this is with frequency counts.  I don't need to actually rearrange anything; I just need to verify that the *counts* of each letter match. This is pretty textbook stuff.\n\nHere's my plan:\n1.  Concatenate the guest and host names into a single string.\n2.  Count the frequency of each letter in this combined string.\n3.  Separately, count the frequency of each letter in the pile of letters.\n4.  Finally, compare these two frequency counts. If they're identical, then the pile is a valid \"anagram\" (or permutation, in this context) of the combined names.\n\nI can do these counts a couple of ways. The obvious Pythonic approach is to use `collections.Counter`.  That'll make the code clean and readable, which is always a win.  But, just to be thorough and because it's good to be able to do this manually, I could also use a list (or array) of size 26 to store the counts of each letter (A-Z) and manually increment the corresponding index.  That gives me an `O(n)` time complexity regardless.\n\nI'm leaning towards `collections.Counter` because it's less verbose. I'd initialize a counter for the combined names, another for the pile, and then just compare the two. If they're equal, print \"YES\", otherwise \"NO.\"\n\nAnd that's it. It's a quick exercise in character counting and the choice of which data structure makes a difference, but not here. I can test both implementations, but I know either should work. This seems pretty straightforward, and I'm confident in my approach.\n",
