Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Tackling a Tricky String Replacement Problem**\n\nAlright, so I've got this competitive programming problem on my plate, and it's all about string replacements and modular arithmetic. The core of it seems to be avoiding the pitfalls of brute-force string manipulation, as the string length can blow up exponentially.\n\nLet's see, I start with a string `s` of digits. Then, I have a bunch of queries, each of the form \"replace digit `di` with string `ti`.\" The goal is to apply these replacements sequentially and, at the end, figure out the numerical value of the resulting string modulo 10^9 + 7.  The constraints are fairly typical for this kind of problem, so I can't be too cavalier with my approach.\n\nMy first thought is that direct replacements are a non-starter. If I have \"1 -> 11,\" repeatedly applied, the string would grow like crazy.  It's clear that I need to find some clever way to track how each digit's contribution to the final number changes throughout the process, without actually building the entire final string.\n\nThe problem specifically says the replacement applies to the current string at each step.  For instance, if I start with \"123123\" and have a rule \"2 -> 00,\" I'll get \"10031003.\" This is crucial. Also, empty strings as replacements (`t_i`) are allowed; like if I had \"2 -> \" and then \"0 -> 7\" applied to `s = 222`. This yields \"777\".\n\nThinking about how numbers are represented, it's all about powers of 10. Each digit `d_j` in a string contributes `d_j * 10^j` to the overall value.  The replacement rules are going to mess with this pretty significantly, because they'll affect the position (and thus the power of 10) of all the digits.  If I replace a digit `di` with a string `ti` of length L, it will essentially shift everything to the right of `di` (if L > 1) or to the left (if L < 1).\n\nThe crucial insight, though, is that the queries are processed in order.  So, whatever I do, the order of application of the rules seems important. I need to figure out a smart way to propagate these effects through the string without actually constructing the final monstrous string. It's a question of maintaining the essence of the digits' positions and values as the replacements cascade. I have some ideas now - time to explore them.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the value of a string of digits, after several replacement operations, modulo 1000000007. The string can become very long, so we cannot explicitly construct it. We need an efficient way to track the value and length of the string segments.\n\nLet's define `val[d]` as the numerical value modulo `MOD` of the string that digit `d` eventually transforms into, and `len[d]` as the length of that transformed string. Initially, for each digit `d` (from 0 to 9), `val[d] = d` and `len[d] = 1`.\n\nThe queries are processed in reverse order. This is a common technique for problems where operations affect subsequent elements or values. When we process queries in reverse, we are determining how a digit `d_i` *would have been* replaced if it were encountered in the original string `s`.\n\nLet's say we are processing a query `di -> ti`. This means that any `di` in the current string `s` is replaced by `ti`. If we process this in reverse, we are essentially saying: \"What is the final value and length of the character `di` if it were present in the string *before* this query?\"\n\nWhen we encounter a query `di -> ti` in reverse order:\n1.  We need to update `val[di]` and `len[di]`.\n2.  The string `ti` itself might contain digits that are subject to *later* replacements (which we have already processed because we're going in reverse). So, to find the true `val[di]` and `len[di]` after this `di -> ti` query, we need to sum up the `val` and `len` values for each character in `ti`.\n\nLet `MOD = 1000000007`.\n\nFor each character `c` in `ti` (from left to right):\n*   `new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, len[int(c)], MOD) + val[int(c)]) % MOD`\n*   `new_len_di = (new_len_di + len[int(c)]) % (MOD - 1)` (Lengths are added, and since they appear in exponents, we take them modulo `MOD - 1` by Fermat's Little Theorem).\n    *   Note: `MOD - 1` is used for exponents because `10^(MOD-1) % MOD = 1` if `MOD` is prime and `10` is not a multiple of `MOD`. Here `MOD = 10^9 + 7` is prime. The only edge case is if `len[int(c)]` is 0, then `pow(10, 0)` is 1. If `new_len_di` could become 0 and we take `0 % (MOD-1)`, it's still 0, which is fine. The sum of lengths can be very large, so `new_len_di` should be `min(new_len_di + len[int(c)], MOD-1)` or just `(new_len_di + len[int(c)]) % (MOD-1)` if we ensure that `MOD-1` is large enough to avoid `MOD-1` becoming `0` for small inputs. `MOD-1` is `10^9+6`, which is large enough.\n\nAfter processing all characters in `ti`, `val[di]` becomes `new_val_di` and `len[di]` becomes `new_len_di`.\n\n**Initial values:**\n`val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n`len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n**Processing queries in reverse:**\nLet `queries` be a list of `(di, ti)` tuples.\nIterate `i` from `n-1` down to `0`:\n    `di, ti = queries[i]`\n    If `ti` is empty:\n        `val[int(di)] = 0`\n        `len[int(di)] = 0`\n    Else:\n        `current_val = 0`\n        `current_len = 0`\n        For `c` in `ti`:\n            `digit = int(c)`\n            `current_val = (current_val * pow(10, len[digit], MOD) + val[digit]) % MOD`\n            `current_len = (current_len + len[digit]) % (MOD - 1)`\n        `val[int(di)] = current_val`\n        `len[int(di)] = current_len`\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nAfter all queries are processed, iterate through the initial string `s` from left to right:\n`final_value = 0`\n`final_length = 0` (This is not strictly needed for the final sum, but conceptually useful)\nFor `c` in `s`:\n    `digit = int(c)`\n    `final_value = (final_value * pow(10, len[digit], MOD) + val[digit]) % MOD`\n\nThe `final_value` is the answer.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n*   Empty string `ti`: Handled by setting `val[di] = 0` and `len[di] = 0`. This correctly means it contributes nothing to the value and doesn't shift subsequent digits.\n*   Empty string `s` after replacements: If `s` becomes empty, the number is 0. Our calculation correctly yields 0 if all digits in `s` map to empty strings.\n*   Leading zeros: The problem states \"ignore the leading zeroes\". Our modular arithmetic approach naturally handles this. If the string `s` becomes \"007\", its value is 7. Our calculation `(0 * 10^len[0] + val[0]) * 10^len[0] + val[0]) * 10^len[7] + val[7]` will correctly give 7 if `val[0]` is 0. Since `val[0]` starts as 0 and stays 0 unless `0` is replaced by something non-empty, this works. The example `222 -> 0 -> 7` gives `777`, not `007` or `7`, because `0` is replaced by `7`, not `0` being ignored. The \"ignore leading zeroes\" rule applies to the *final* string `s` when interpreted as a number, not to intermediate replacement strings. The note clarifies \"leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement\". This means `2->00` on `123` becoming `1003` is correct, not `13`. Our approach correctly treats `0` as a digit with its own value and length.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Reading input: `O(|s| + n + sum(|ti|))`\n*   Processing queries in reverse: `n` queries. For each query `di -> ti`, we iterate through `ti`. The total work for this step is `O(sum(|ti|))`. Inside the loop, `pow` takes `O(log(MOD))` time.\n*   Final calculation: Iterate through `s`. `O(|s| * log(MOD))`.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(|s| * log(MOD) + sum(|ti|) * log(MOD))`. Given `|s| <= 10^5`, `sum(|ti|) <= 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n*   Space complexity: `O(n + sum(|ti|))` to store queries, `O(1)` for `val` and `len` arrays.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries_raw = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries_raw.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    # Parse queries into a list of (digit_char, replacement_string) tuples\n    queries = []\n    for q_str in queries_raw:\n        parts = q_str.split(\"->\")\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1]\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    MOD_EXP = MOD - 1 # For exponents in modular exponentiation (Fermat's Little Theorem)\n\n    # Initialize val[d] and len[d] for each digit d\n    # val[d]: the numerical value of the string that digit d eventually transforms into, modulo MOD\n    # len[d]: the length of the string that digit d eventually transforms into, modulo MOD_EXP\n    val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di_char, ti_str = queries[i]\n        di = int(di_char)\n\n        if not ti_str:  # ti is an empty string\n            val[di] = 0\n            length[di] = 0\n        else:\n            current_val = 0\n            current_len = 0\n            # For each character in ti, accumulate its value and length\n            # based on the already processed (later) transformations\n            for char_in_ti in ti_str:\n                digit_in_ti = int(char_in_ti)\n                \n                # Update current_val: (current_val * 10^(length of char_in_ti) + val of char_in_ti) % MOD\n                # The length[digit_in_ti] is taken modulo MOD_EXP because it's an exponent\n                current_val = (current_val * pow(10, length[digit_in_ti], MOD) + val[digit_in_ti]) % MOD\n                \n                # Update current_len: sum of lengths, modulo MOD_EXP\n                current_len = (current_len + length[digit_in_ti]) % MOD_EXP\n            \n            val[di] = current_val\n            length[di] = current_len\n\n    # Calculate the final value of the initial string s\n    final_result = 0\n    for char_s in s:\n        digit_s = int(char_s)\n        # Apply the same accumulation logic\n        final_result = (final_result * pow(10, length[digit_s], MOD) + val[digit_s]) % MOD\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_result) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
