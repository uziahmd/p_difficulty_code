His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to figure out Vasya's best and worst possible ranks in an Olympiad. The inputs are the number of participants (`n`), Vasya's minimum total score (`x`), and the scores from the first and second tours (`a` and `b`, each with `n` scores). The tricky part is that we don't know which score in `a` corresponds to which score in `b` for any participant, and we're only given points, not names.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are, given that the input is an arbitrary order, this must be some sort of pairing problem. The goal is to determine the highest and lowest rank Vasya *could* achieve, given a minimum score.\n\nThe initial hunch suggests that I have to consider all possible score combinations for Vasya, meaning any pair `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. Then for each possible score that Vasya might achieve, I need to figure out how the remaining scores will impact his rank.\n\nThe rules are pretty standard: participants are ranked by decreasing total score, and ties are decided by the jury. This means if the highest score is the same for multiple participants, Vasya's best rank is achieved if he's tied for first. His worst rank is if he's tied for last with some people.\n\nTo get the *best* rank, I need to maximize Vasya's score and ensure that as few as possible other people score higher.\n\nTo get the *worst* rank, I need to minimize Vasya's score (while still being at least `x`) and maximize the number of other participants who score as high or higher.\n\nThe problem specifically mentions the arbitrary order. This means that if Vasya gets the best score, say `a_max` plus `b_max`, no one else could do better. The best rank is easy: one.  But if Vasya doesn't have `a_max`, how do I figure out his minimum and how to calculate his worst rank?\n\nThe key must lie in how the scores are paired up, and how this impacts the number of people above or equal to Vasya's score. The guarantee that Vasya's score can be >= `x` means that at least one pairing will give him a good total.  So for best rank, if I can show Vasya must score maximum, he wins.\n\nI think for the best rank, the strategy is this: take the maximum in `a` and the maximum in `b`. If the sum meets the score requirement, Vasya's rank is 1. If Vasya can't take the biggest numbers, then some others *must* take the big ones. To find the worst, it's about minimizing Vasya's score and then making as many people score higher or equal as possible to push him down in the rankings. The problem becomes a kind of bipartite matching problem - finding the best and worst scenarios to affect ranking, but efficiently.\n\n**Solution Approach**\n\nTo calculate the *worst* rank efficiently:\n1.  Find the smallest `S_V_target` (Vasya's possible score) that satisfies the requirement that `S_V_target >= x` . Sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order and find the smallest pairing using binary search. This takes O(n log n).\n2.  Then, sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. Use two pointers to count the number of pairings that sum to at least `S_V_target`. That's Vasya's worst rank.\n\nThe best rank is simple: 1.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad. We are given `n` participants, a minimum total score `x` Vasya achieved, and two lists of `n` scores each, `a` for the first tour and `b` for the second tour. The crucial information is that the scores in `a` and `b` are given in \"arbitrary order,\" meaning we can pair any `a_i` with any `b_j` to form a participant's total score, as long as each score from `a` and `b` is used exactly once. Also, if participants have the same total score, the jury assigns places, which affects how we calculate best and worst ranks.\n\nLet's analyze the best and worst rank scenarios:\n\n**1. Best Rank for Vasya**\n\nTo achieve the best possible rank, Vasya wants to:\na. Maximize his own total score, `S_V`, subject to `S_V >= x`.\nb. Arrange the pairings of the other `n-1` participants such that as few as possible of them score *strictly greater* than `S_V`. If other participants score `S_P = S_V`, the jury can place Vasya ahead of them.\n\nConsider the maximum possible score any participant can get: `max(a) + max(b)`. Let `a_max = max(a)` and `b_max = max(b)`.\nThe problem guarantees that \"there are two integers i, j (1 <= i, j <= n) such, that ai + bj >= x\". This means Vasya's actual score `S_V` is at least `x`. Since `a_max + b_max` is the largest possible sum a participant can achieve, it must be `a_max + b_max >= x`.\n\nTherefore, Vasya *could* be the participant who scored `a_max` in the first tour and `b_max` in the second tour. His total score would be `S_V = a_max + b_max`.\nWith this score, no other participant can possibly score strictly higher than Vasya, because `a_max + b_max` is the absolute maximum total score. If any other participant also achieves `a_max + b_max` (which is only possible if `n > 1` and there are duplicate `a_max` or `b_max` values), the jury can still assign Vasya the first place among them.\nThus, Vasya can always achieve the **1st place**.\n\n**2. Worst Rank for Vasya**\n\nTo achieve the worst possible rank, Vasya wants to:\na. Pick `a_i` and `b_j` such that his total score `S_V = a_i + b_j` is as *low as possible*, subject to `S_V >= x`.\nb. Arrange the pairings of the other `n-1` participants such that as *many as possible* of them score `S_P >= S_V`. If other participants score `S_P = S_V`, the jury can place Vasya behind them.\n\nFirst, let's find Vasya's minimum possible score `S_V_min` such that `S_V_min >= x`.\nSort both `a` and `b` lists in ascending order. Let them be `a_sorted` and `b_sorted`.\nWe can find `S_V_min` efficiently:\nInitialize `S_V_min = infinity`.\nIterate through each `val_a` in `a_sorted`. For each `val_a`, we need to find the smallest `val_b` in `b_sorted` such that `val_a + val_b >= x`. This is equivalent to `val_b >= x - val_a`.\nSince `b_sorted` is sorted, we can use binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the index `k` of the first element in `b_sorted` that is `>= (x - val_a)`.\nIf such a `val_b` exists (i.e., `k < n`), then `val_a + b_sorted[k]` is a candidate for `S_V_min`. We update `S_V_min = min(S_V_min, val_a + b_sorted[k])`.\nThis process takes `O(N log N)` time.\n\nOnce we have `S_V_min`, we assume Vasya scores exactly `S_V_min`. Now we need to determine the maximum number of participants (including Vasya) who can score `S_P >= S_V_min`. This count will be Vasya's worst rank.\nTo maximize the number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= S_V_min`, we use a greedy approach:\n1. Sort `a` in ascending order.\n2. Sort `b` in descending order.\n3. Use two pointers, `ptr_a` for `a` and `ptr_b` for `b`, both starting at index 0.\n4. Initialize `count = 0`.\n5. While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b < n`:\n   If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= S_V_min`:\n     This pair `(a[ptr_a], b[ptr_b])` can achieve a score of at least `S_V_min`. We use them. Increment `count`, `ptr_a++`, `ptr_b++`.\n   Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < S_V_min`):\n     Since `a[ptr_a]` is the smallest available score in `a` and `b[ptr_b]` is the largest available score in `b`, `a[ptr_a]` cannot form a sum `>= S_V_min` with any remaining `b` score (as any other `b_k` would be smaller than `b[ptr_b]`). So, `a[ptr_a]` cannot be part of a \"high-scoring\" pair. We discard `a[ptr_a]` and move to the next `a` score. `ptr_a++`.\n6. The final `count` is the maximum number of participants who can score `S_P >= S_V_min`. This `count` will be Vasya's worst rank.\n\nThis greedy strategy correctly finds the maximum number of pairs. This is because if `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= S_V_min`, pairing them up is optimal. If we didn't pair `a[ptr_a]` with `b[ptr_b]`, we would have to pair `a[ptr_a]` with some `b_k < b[ptr_b]` (making the sum smaller, less likely to be `>= S_V_min`) or `b[ptr_b]` with some `a_k > a[ptr_a]` (potentially \"wasting\" `b[ptr_b]` on an `a_k` that could have formed a high sum with a smaller `b`). The greedy choice ensures we use the smallest `a` and largest `b` to maximize the chance of meeting the threshold.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Second Sample):**\n`n=6, x=7`\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`\n`b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`\n\n1. **Best Rank:** 1 (as explained above).\n\n2. **Worst Rank:**\n   a. Find `S_V_min`:\n      `a_sorted = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n      `b_sorted = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n      Initialize `S_V_min = infinity`.\n      For `val_a` in `a_sorted`:\n      - `val_a = 3`: `x - val_a = 7 - 3 = 4`. `bisect_left(b_sorted, 4)` is index 2 (`b_sorted[2]=4`). `3+4=7`. `S_V_min = min(inf, 7) = 7`.\n      - `val_a = 4`: `x - val_a = 7 - 4 = 3`. `bisect_left(b_sorted, 3)` is index 1 (`b_sorted[1]=3`). `4+3=7`. `S_V_min = min(7, 7) = 7`.\n      - ... (other values will yield sums >= 7, but not less than 7).\n      So, `S_V_min = 7`.\n\n   b. Count maximum pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= 7`:\n      `a_asc = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n      `b_desc = [8, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0]`\n      `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 0`, `count = 0`\n\n      1. `a_asc[0] + b_desc[0] = 3 + 8 = 11`. `11 >= 7`. `count = 1`. `ptr_a = 1`, `ptr_b = 1`.\n      2. `a_asc[1] + b_desc[1] = 4 + 6 = 10`. `10 >= 7`. `count = 2`. `ptr_a = 2`, `ptr_b = 2`.\n      3. `a_asc[2] + b_desc[2] = 4 + 4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `count = 3`. `ptr_a = 3`, `ptr_b = 3`.\n      4. `a_asc[3] + b_desc[3] = 4 + 4 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `count = 4`. `ptr_a = 4`, `ptr_b = 4`.\n      5. `a_asc[4] + b_desc[4] = 5 + 3 = 8`. `8 >= 7`. `count = 5`. `ptr_a = 5`, `ptr_b = 5`.\n      6. `a_asc[5] + b_desc[5] = 6 + 0 = 6`. `6 < 7`. `ptr_a = 6`.\n      Loop ends as `ptr_a = 6`.\n\n      The maximum number of participants scoring `>= 7` is `5`.\n      So, Vasya's worst rank is **5**.\n\nFinal Output: `1 5`\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best Rank\n    # Vasya can always choose to be the participant with the highest score in tour A and highest in tour B.\n    # Let these be a_max and b_max.
