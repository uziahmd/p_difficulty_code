Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**X-Shaped Grid Verification**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to determine if a given character grid forms a perfect 'X'. The grid is `n x n`, where `n` is an odd number and falls between 3 and 300.  The rules are pretty specific: all characters along both diagonals must be identical, all characters *not* on the diagonals must also be identical, and crucially, these two groups of characters (diagonals and non-diagonals) must be *different*.\n\nLet me break down my approach. First, I'll read in the grid's size, `n`, and then read the grid itself as input. I'm thinking a list of strings or a list of lists of characters should work fine for storage.\n\nNext, I need to identify and extract those diagonal characters. The main diagonal consists of `(i, i)` coordinates, and the anti-diagonal is `(i, n - 1 - i)`. Remember, the center cell gets counted twice since it's on both diagonals.\n\nNow comes the validation. I'll pick the character at `grid[0][0]` as a starting point. Let's call it `diag_char`.  I'll then iterate through all cells on both diagonals. If any character *isn't* equal to `diag_char`, it's an immediate \"NO\" and I can stop.\n\nNext, I need to check the non-diagonal characters. I'll grab the first non-diagonal character, say `grid[0][1]`, and call it `other_char`. I'll go through every cell in the grid, but with a twist. For diagonal cells, I make sure they're equal to `diag_char`, just to be absolutely sure. For non-diagonal cells, I must confirm they're all equal to `other_char`.  If anything doesn't match, it's another \"NO\" and I exit.\n\nFinally, the crucial difference check. After all that validation, I *have* to make sure `diag_char` and `other_char` are actually different! If they're the same, it's a \"NO\".\n\nIf I've made it through all those checks without encountering any inconsistencies, then and only then, do I print \"YES\".\n\nTo refine, I'll simplify the code a bit. I can initialize `other_char` to `None` and find the first non-diagonal character during iteration. This saves a separate step. I think this will work!\n",
