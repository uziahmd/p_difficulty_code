Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the \"New Year Candles\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"New Year Candles\" problem, and I need to write a Python script to solve it.  It's a straightforward simulation, really.  Vasily starts with a certain number of candles, let's call that `a`. Each candle burns for an hour and then goes out.  The catch is, he can use `b` spent candles to make one new candle.  The goal is to figure out the total number of hours Vasily can keep his room lit.\n\nMy approach will be a simulation, step-by-step. I'll need to keep track of three key variables: `total_hours`, obviously, the total time lit. Then `current_new_candles`, how many candles he can light at this moment, and `burned_out_candles`, the ones waiting to be crafted into more candles.\n\nHere's how I envision the simulation:\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Start with `total_hours = 0` and `burned_out_candles = 0`. His initial number of new candles is simply `a`, so `current_new_candles = a`.\n2.  **The Loop:** This loop is going to run as long as he has *any* candles left to light, meaning `current_new_candles > 0`.\n    *   **Light 'em Up:** He lights all the candles he has, which is `current_new_candles`.  I'll add that number to `total_hours`. And, of course, these candles burn out, so I'll also add that amount to `burned_out_candles`.\n    *   **Crafting Time:** Now, I'll need to figure out how many *new* candles he can make from his `burned_out_candles`. It's integer division, so `new_candles_from_crafting = burned_out_candles // b`. Then, I'll need to update `burned_out_candles` to reflect the remainder: `burned_out_candles = burned_out_candles % b`.\n    *   **Next Round:** His `current_new_candles` for the *next* iteration will be the `new_candles_from_crafting` he just made.\n3.  **Loop Termination:**  The loop ends when he has no new candles to light (i.e.  `current_new_candles` becomes 0).\n\nI should be able to check my logic with the example they provided. If `a = 4` and `b = 2`, I should get `7` as my answer.\n\n**Constraint Check:** I also noticed the constraints: `1 <= a <= 1000` and `2 <= b <= 1000`. This is good to know, and it tells me that the number of iterations shouldn't be too crazy. As `a` gets whittled down or stays the same relative to `b`, the crafting process helps me to converge quickly. Okay, time to code this up!\n",
