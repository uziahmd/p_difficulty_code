Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Approach for \"Crazy Town\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and here's my thought process. The core of this is graph traversal, disguised as a geometric problem. We have two points, home and the university, and a bunch of lines (roads) cutting up the plane into distinct blocks. The goal is to figure out the fewest road crossings needed to get from home to the university.\n\nMy initial thought is that the number of steps is equivalent to the number of roads we have to cross. The trick, then, is determining which roads are *necessary* to cross. Since we're moving from one block to an adjacent one by crossing a road segment, I need to figure out which roads actually separate the home and university blocks.\n\nThe crucial insight here is using the line equation and sign of the function. For a line `ax + by + c = 0`, if `f(x, y) = ax + by + c`, the sign of `f(x, y)` tells me which side of the line the point `(x, y)` lies on. Since the problem guarantees that the home and university aren't directly *on* any road, `f(x1, y1)` and `f(x2, y2)` will always be non-zero. If both `f(x1, y1)` and `f(x2, y2)` have the same sign (both positive or both negative) for a given road, the home and university are on the same side of that road. No crossing is required. But, if the signs are opposite (one positive, one negative), they're on opposite sides, and *that* road must be crossed.\n\nSo, here's the plan. I'll iterate through each road, calculate `f(x1, y1)` and `f(x2, y2)` for that road. If the product of those two values is negative, meaning they have opposite signs, I increment my step counter. Otherwise, I ignore that road. The final step counter value will then give me the minimum number of crossings necessary, which is the shortest path. This should be a fairly elegant and efficient solution!\n",
