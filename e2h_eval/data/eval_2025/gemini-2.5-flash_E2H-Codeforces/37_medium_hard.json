    "thought": "**Problem Understanding and Strategy for Solving the \"Gluttony\" Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. This \"Gluttony\" problem wants a permutation `b` of an input array `a` such that the sums of elements in any non-empty proper subset of `a` differ from the corresponding subset sums in `b`. The key here is the *any* subset condition.\n\nThe constraint on the array size, `n <= 22`, is a huge hint. This screams \"try all subsets\" (bitmasking) or some sort of meet-in-the-middle approach, right? But the permutation part complicates things. `n!` permutations are a big no-no.\n\nMy first instinct is to try a simple, easily constructed permutation. The cyclic shift immediately pops into mind:  `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]`. It's efficient, easy to test, and hopefully will give us *a* solution, if one exists.\n\nNow, checking the crucial sum condition is the tricky part. Let's form the differences array `d`, where `d[i] = a[i] - b[i]`. If the cyclic shift works, then there should be *no* subset of indices `S` (excluding the empty set and the full set) such that the sum of `d[i]` for `i` in `S` is equal to 0.\n\nMy plan is to iterate through all possible non-empty proper subsets using bitmasks. For each mask, I'll calculate the sum of `d[i]` where the bit is set. If any such sum equals zero, the cyclic shift fails, and I'll have to return -1 (no solution). If the loop completes without finding a zero sum, then the cyclic shift gives a solution, and I can just print the array `b`.\n\nThe time complexity of this bitmask approach would be O(n * 2^n), which is perfectly acceptable for n <= 22. I'll need to be mindful of potential integer overflows during subset sum calculations, but the problem's constraints imply that standard 64-bit integer will do just fine.\n\nFinally, I want to make sure the edge cases are covered. What if n = 1? Well, then any `b=a` will work. The code should handle it correctly.\n\nIn essence, the strategy is:\n\n1.  **Construct `b` using the cyclic shift.**\n2.  **Calculate the differences array `d = a - b`.**\n3.  **Iterate through all non-empty, proper subsets using bitmasks.**\n4.  **For each subset, check if the sum of differences in `d` is zero.**\n5.  **If a zero sum is found, no solution exists (return -1). Otherwise, print `b`.**\n\nThis cyclic shift idea looks promising, and I'm optimistic it will give a solution for this problem! Let's get to coding!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` of `n` distinct integers such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S` (i.e., `0 < |S| < n`), the sum of elements in `a` at these positions is different from the sum of elements in `b` at these positions. That is, `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`. If no such `b` exists, we should print -1. The constraint `n <= 22` is a strong hint for solutions involving subsets, often `O(n * 2^n)` or `O(2^n)`.\n\nLet's rephrase the condition: For any `S` with `0 < |S| < n`, we need `sum_{i in S} a[i] - sum_{i in S} b[i] != 0`.\nLet `d[i] = a[i] - b[i]`. Then the condition becomes `sum_{i in S} d[i] != 0` for all `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nSince `b` must be a permutation of `a`, the sum of all elements in `a` is equal to the sum of all elements in `b`. This means `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b[i]`. Consequently, `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d[i] = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a[i] - b[i]) = 0`.\nThe problem statement explicitly excludes the subset containing all indices (`k < n`), so `S = {0, ..., n-1}` is not checked. This means the sum of all `d[i]` being 0 is allowed and expected.\n\nA common strategy for constructive problems like this, especially with small `n`, is to try a simple, fixed permutation. A cyclic shift is a good candidate. Let's try constructing `b` such that `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]`.\n\n**Proposed Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `n` and the array `a`.\n2.  Construct the candidate array `b` using a cyclic shift: `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.\n3.  Construct the difference array `d`: `d[i] = a[i] - b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.\n4.  Check if any non-empty proper subset of `d` sums to zero.\n    This can be done by iterating through all possible masks from `1` to `2^n - 2` (inclusive).\n    *   For each `mask`, calculate `current_sum = sum_{i: (mask >> i) & 1} d[i]`.\n    *   If `current_sum == 0`, then this `b` is invalid. In this case, print -1 and terminate.\n5.  If the loop completes without finding any subset sum of `d` equal to zero, then the constructed `b` is a valid solution. Print the elements of `b` separated by spaces.\n\n**Edge Case: n=1**\nIf `n=1`, `a = [x]`. The cyclic shift gives `b = [x]`.\nThe condition `0 < k < n` means there are no non-empty proper subsets of indices. So, the condition is vacuously true. `b=[x]` is always a valid solution.\nIn the algorithm, the loop for `mask` runs from `1` to `2^1 - 2 = 0`. Since the range is empty, the loop does not execute, and `b` is printed. This correctly handles `n=1`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   Reading input: `O(n)`\n*   Constructing `b` and `d`: `O(n)`\n*   Checking subset sums: There are `2^n` subsets. For each subset, summing its elements takes `O(n)` time. So, this step is `O(n * 2^n)`.\n*   Printing output: `O(n)`\n\nFor `n=22`, `n * 2^n = 22 * 2^22 = 22 * 4,194,304 \\approx 9.2 * 10^7`. This is well within typical time limits for competitive programming (usually around `10^8` operations per second).\nThe `a_i` values can be up to `10^9`, so sums can be up to `22 * 10^9`. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle this automatically, so there are no overflow concerns.\n\nThis strategy is known to work for many instances of such problems, and often for all instances if a solution exists. The problem is designed such that this specific construction is sufficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        # For n=1, there are no non-empty proper subsets of indices.\n        # So, b must be a permutation of a, which means b=a.\n        # The condition is vacuously true.\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Construct b by a cyclic shift of a\n    # b[i] = a[(i+1)%n]\n    b = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        b[i] = a[(i + 1) % n]\n\n    # Construct the difference array d_i = a[i] - b[i]\n    d = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        d[i] = a[i] - b[i]\n\n    # Check if any non-empty proper subset of d sums to 0\n    # Iterate through all masks from 1 to 2^n - 2\n    # (excluding the empty set and the full set)\n    # The full set sum is always 0 because b is a permutation of a.\n    \n    # Using a set to store sums encountered for a meet-in-the-middle approach\n    # or just brute force all subsets.
