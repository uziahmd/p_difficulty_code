A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Soft Drinking\" Problem: A Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Soft Drinking\" problem and need a Python script to find the solution. Let's break this down meticulously to ensure I understand the constraints and calculations.\n\nFirst, I see the input: the number of friends (`n`), drinks, limes, and salt, along with the quantities per item and the requirements per friend per toast. The goal is clear: maximize the number of toasts everyone can make, drinking the same amount.\n\nThe constraints are manageable: positive integers, not too large or small. Now, the meat of the matter: the calculations.  My initial thought was to calculate total resources and then divide by the *total* per-toast requirement for all friends. But that's where I need to be more careful, based on that sample explanation.\n\nThe sample, and the problem description, emphasizes that each friend drinks the *same* amount.  It means the total number of individual toasts is what matters, then dividing that to distribute equally among friends. Let's re-think the *individual* toast calculations.\n\nThe total drink is just `k * l` ml.  If each *individual* toast requires `nl` ml, then the total number of individual toasts based on the drink alone is `(k * l) // nl` (using integer division, of course). I'll call this `total_toasts_drink`. And the same applies to limes and salt. I can get an `total_toasts_lime` and `total_toasts_salt`.\n\nSince I want to distribute the toasts evenly, the overall number of toasts I can make is going to be the minimum number of toasts I can make with each resource, divided by the number of friends.  I'll need to figure out how to best implement this in Python. I think I've got a solid understanding of how to set this up now.\n",
