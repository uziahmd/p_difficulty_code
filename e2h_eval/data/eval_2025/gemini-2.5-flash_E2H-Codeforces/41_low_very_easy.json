There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Zoning Restrictions Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Zoning Restrictions Again,\" and I need to write a Python script to solve it. Let's break down my thought process.\n\nI need to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. Each house's height is an integer between 0 and `h`, and the profit is the square of its height. The tricky part is the `m` restrictions. Each restriction `(l, r, x)` says that the *tallest* house in the range `[l, r]` must be at most `x`. The constraints are small, `n, h, m <= 50`, so I'm thinking a polynomial-time solution should be fine.\n\nMy key insight is how to interpret the restrictions. The constraint `max(height[l...r]) <= x` actually implies a *stronger* constraint: *every* house within the range `[l, r]` must be at most `x` tall. If any were taller, the max would be violated. So, for each spot `j`, its maximum allowed height, `H_j`, is the minimum of `h` (the global height limit) and `x_i` for all restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` that cover spot `j`. If a spot isn't covered by any restrictions, its max height is just `h`.\n\nSince we're maximizing profit, and the profit is height squared, I should build each house as tall as possible. So, I calculate `H_j` for each spot `j` and set the house height to that.\n\nThe algorithm then becomes straightforward. First, I initialize an array, `max_allowed_height`, of size `n`, where each element initially is `h`. Then, I iterate through each restriction and, for each covered spot, update its `max_allowed_height` to be the minimum of its current value and the restriction's `x`. Finally, the total profit is simply the sum of the squares of the `max_allowed_height` values.\n\nI'll quickly translate this into Python, using a 0-indexed array to represent the 1-indexed spots. The core logic should be quite efficient given the small constraints. I'm feeling confident this approach will work!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot, we can build a house of integer height `a` between `0` and `h`, gaining `a^2` profit. There are `m` restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house in a given range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nLet's analyze the restrictions. A restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` states that `max(height[j] for j in [l_i, r_i]) <= x_i`. This implies that for *every* spot `j` within the range `[l_i, r_i]`, its height `height[j]` must be less than or equal to `x_i`. If any house `height[j]` in the range `[l_i, r_i]` were greater than `x_i`, the restriction would be violated.\n\nCombining all constraints for a single spot `j`:\n1. The general height limit: `0 <= height[j] <= h`.\n2. For every restriction `(l_k, r_k, x_k)` that covers spot `j` (i.e., `l_k <= j <= r_k`), `height[j] <= x_k`.\n\nTherefore, for each spot `j`, the maximum permissible height `H_j` is `h` initially, and then it is further constrained by all `x_k` values from restrictions that cover `j`. Specifically, `H_j = min(h, min(x_k for all k such that l_k <= j <= r_k))`. If no restrictions cover spot `j`, then `H_j = h`.\n\nTo maximize the total profit, since the profit `a^2` is always non-negative and strictly increasing for `a >= 0`, we should always choose the maximum possible height for each house. So, for each spot `j`, we will build a house with height `H_j`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. Initialize an array, say `spot_max_height`, of size `n`. Each element `spot_max_height[j]` will store the maximum allowed height for the house at spot `j+1` (using 0-indexed array for 1-indexed spots). Initially, set all elements to `h`.\n2. Iterate through each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\n   For each spot `j` from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive):\n     Update `spot_max_height[j-1]` (for 0-indexed array) to `min(spot_max_height[j-1], x_i)`. This ensures that the house at spot `j` respects the current restriction.\n3. After processing all restrictions, `spot_max_height[j]` will contain the maximum possible height for the house at spot `j+1` that satisfies all conditions.\n4. Calculate the total profit by summing the squares of these maximum allowed heights: `total_profit = sum(height^2 for height in spot_max_height)`.\n5. Print `total_profit`.\n\nExample Walkthrough (First Example):\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions:\n1. `(1, 1, 1)`\n2. `(2, 2, 3)`\n3. `(3, 3, 2)`\n\n1. Initialize `spot_max_height = [h, h, h] = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Process restrictions:\n   - Restriction `(1, 1, 1)`: For `j=1`, `spot_max_height[0] = min(spot_max_height[0], 1) = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n     `spot_max_height` is now `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - Restriction `(2, 2, 3)`: For `j=2`, `spot_max_height[1] = min(spot_max_height[1], 3) = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n     `spot_max_height` is still `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - Restriction `(3, 3, 2)`: For `j=3`, `spot_max_height[2] = min(spot_max_height[2], 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n     `spot_max_height` is now `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\n3. Calculate total profit:\n   `1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\nThe constraints `n, h, m <= 50` are very small.\n- Initializing `spot_max_height`: `O(n)`\n- Processing `m` restrictions: For each restriction, we iterate up to `n` spots. So, `O(m * n)`\n- Calculating total profit: `O(n)`\nThe total time complexity is `O(n + m*n)`, which simplifies to `O(m*n)`. Given `n, m <= 50`, `50 * 50 = 2500` operations, which is extremely fast and well within typical time limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize the maximum allowed height for each spot.\n    # Initially, each spot can have a house up to height 'h'.\n    # We use a 0-indexed array, so spot_max_height[i] corresponds to spot i+1.\n    spot_max_height = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each zoning restriction\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Adjust l and r to be 0-indexed for array access\n        # A restriction (l, r, x) means all houses from spot l to spot r (inclusive)\n        # must have height at most x.\n        # This implies that for each spot j in [l, r], its height must be <= x.\n        for i in range(l - 1, r):\n            spot_max_height[i] = min(spot_max_height[i], x)\n\n    # Calculate the total profit\n    # To maximize profit, each house should be built to its maximum allowed height.\n    total_profit = 0\n    for height in spot_max_height:\n        total_profit += height * height\n\n    print(total_profit)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the solution\nsolve()\n\n```",
