            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Lanterns\n\nVanya walks late at night along a straight street of length l, lit by n lanterns. Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem. My goal is to find the smallest radius 'd' for the lanterns so that the entire street is illuminated.**\n\nFirst, I need to really get a handle on what the problem is asking. We have a street of length 'l', lanterns at specific points, and each lantern has a range 'd' that it lights up. I need to figure out the minimal 'd' required to cover the entire street, including the beginning (point 0) and the end (point 'l').\n\nA key insight here is that sorting the lantern positions makes this much more manageable.  Once sorted, I can look at the gaps between lanterns. To ensure that the whole street is lit, I have three conditions to satisfy:\n\n1.  **Light up the start:**  The very first lantern's light radius must reach point 0, so 'd' must be at least as large as the first lantern's position (let's call it `a_0`). This gives me `d_start = a_0`.\n2.  **Light up the end:**  Similarly, the last lantern's light must reach point 'l'.  Therefore, 'd' must be at least the distance from the last lantern to 'l'. That gives `d_end = l - a_{n-1}`.\n3.  **Light up the gaps:**  This is where things get a bit more interesting. Between any two adjacent lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, I need to ensure that their light ranges meet.  That is, `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`, which leads to `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.  I need to find the largest of these gap sizes across all lantern pairs, which I'll call `d_middle`.\n\nNow, the minimum 'd' for the entire street will be the *largest* of `d_start`, `d_end`, and `d_middle`.  This way, I cover every point, the start, and the end. I then need to make sure I take care of some edge cases: when there is only one lantern, and when a lantern is at the edge of the street (0 or l). I have gone through different examples to check the cases.\n\nNow, I'll put this logic into a Python script.  I'll read in the input, sort the lantern positions, and then compute `d_start`, `d_end`, and `d_middle`. The final result will be the maximum of these three values. I need to make sure to do floating-point calculations to maintain the required precision.\n\nMy algorithm will consist of reading the input, sorting, computing the values from the three conditions, calculating the maximum 'd', and then printing this with the necessary precision. I did some dry runs through the two provided samples, and they are working as expected. I'm confident in the code now.\n\nFinally, I tested my solution with the given examples and other custom test cases and they are producing the correct output with the requested precision.\n",
