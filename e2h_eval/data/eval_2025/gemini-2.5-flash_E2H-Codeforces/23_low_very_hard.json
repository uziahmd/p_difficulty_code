            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Tokitsukaze Mahjong Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem involving Tokitsukaze and Mahjong.  The core of it is figuring out the *minimum* number of draws needed to form at least one \"mentsu\" (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) given her initial three tiles. I'm thinking, since I'm given three initial tiles, the answer can be 0, 1, or 2, at most. That's immediately helpful to limit my solution space. I know with two draws, I have five tiles, and a mentsu is always possible.\n\nMy initial thoughts are, I need a clear way to represent these tiles. I'm leaning towards a tuple-like structure: `(number, suit)`. For instance, \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`. This seems like it will be easiest to manipulate programmatically.  \n\nI should start by checking the simplest case: zero draws. Can I form a mentsu *immediately* with the initial three tiles?\n\nTo form a koutsu, I'll need all three tiles to be identical, so `t1 == t2 == t3`.  That's easy to check.\n\nFor a shuntsu, they've all got to be the same suit and the numbers sequential. So I should group by suits and look at the numbers.\n\nHere’s where I started thinking about ordering. Sorting those numbers is the way to do it. It seems like the best approach would be to convert the input tiles into tuples like `(number, suit)` and then sort them, after confirming that they're the same suit. Sorting will simplify the logic for checking sequential numbers. The sorting part is key to checking if the numbers are sequential. I should make sure to handle all suits properly.\n\nIf the answer isn't 0 draws, what about 1? If those zero draw conditions aren't met, I'll have to add one extra tile and check.  I'll explore this next to check for a koutsu or shuntsu with the four tiles.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu. She starts with three tiles. A mentsu can be a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit).\n\nThe maximum number of draws needed is 2. With 2 draws, she will have 5 tiles. It's always possible to form a mentsu with 5 tiles (e.g., by drawing two tiles identical to one of her existing tiles, forming a koutsu). So we only need to check for 0, 1, or 2 draws.\n\nLet the three input tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. Each tile can be represented as a tuple `(number, suit)`. For example, \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`.\n\nWe will check the possibilities in increasing order of draws:\n\n**0 Draws:**\nCan she form a mentsu with her current three tiles `[t1, t2, t3]`?\n1.  **Koutsu:** Check if `t1, t2, t3` are all identical.\n    Example: `(1, 's'), (1, 's'), (1, 's')`\n2.  **Shuntsu:** Check if `t1, t2, t3` are all of the same suit and their numbers are sequential. To do this, sort the numbers of the tiles if their suits are the same.\n    Example: `(1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's')` or `(3, 's'), (1, 's'), (2, 's')`\n\nIf either condition is met, the answer is 0.\n\n**1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws is not enough, can she form a mentsu by drawing one extra tile? She will have 4 tiles. We need to find if there's any tile `t_new` she can draw such that `[t1, t2, t3, t_new]` contains a mentsu.\nThis means we need to find two of her initial tiles `ti, tj` such that `[ti, tj, t_new]` forms a mentsu.\nConsider all pairs of initial tiles `(ti, tj)`:\n1.  **Koutsu:** If `ti == tj`, she can draw `ti` (or `tj`) to form `[ti, ti, ti]`.\n    Example: `(1, 's'), (1, 's')` -> draw `(1, 's')`\n2.  **Shuntsu:** If `ti` and `tj` are of the same suit, and their numbers are `n1, n2`:\n    *   If `n2 == n1 + 1` (assuming `n1 < n2`), she can draw `(n1 - 1, suit)` (if `n1 > 1`) or `(n2 + 1, suit)` (if `n2 < 9`) to form a shuntsu.\n        Example: `(1, 's'), (2, 's')` -> draw `(3, 's')`\n    *   If `n2 == n1 + 2`, she can draw `(n1 + 1, suit)` to form a shuntsu.\n        Example: `(1, 's'), (3, 's')` -> draw `(2, 's')`\n\nIf any of these conditions are met for any pair of initial tiles, the answer is 1.\n\n**2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, the answer must be 2. As explained, it's always possible to form a mentsu with 5 tiles. For example, she can draw two tiles identical to `t1` to form a koutsu `[t1, t1, t1]`.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n1.  **Tile Representation:** Convert input strings like \"1s\" to `(1, 's')`.\n2.  **Sorting:** When checking shuntsu, it's useful to sort the numbers of tiles of the same suit.\n3.  **Sets for Efficiency:** Use sets to store numbers of tiles of the same suit to quickly check for `n-1`, `n+1`, `n-2`, `n+2` gaps.\n\nLet's represent the input tiles as a list of `(number, suit)` tuples.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    tiles_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Convert tiles to (number, suit) tuples\n    tiles = []\n    for t_str in tiles_str:\n        num = int(t_str[0])\n        suit = t_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n\n    # Sort tiles for consistent processing, especially for shuntsu checks\n    # Sorting by suit then number helps group similar tiles.\n    tiles.sort() \n\n    # --- Check for 0 draws ---\n    # Case 1: Koutsu (three identical tiles)\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Case 2: Shuntsu (three sequential tiles of the same suit)\n    # This requires all three tiles to be of the same suit.\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]:\n        nums = [tiles[0][0], tiles[1][0], tiles[2][0]]\n        nums.sort() # Ensure numbers are in ascending order\n        if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # --- Check for 1 draw ---\n    # We need to find if any two of the initial three tiles (t1, t2, t3)\n    # can form a mentsu with one extra tile.\n    # We iterate through all unique pairs of tiles.\n    \n    # Store unique tiles to avoid redundant checks for identical pairs\n    unique_tiles = list(set(tiles))\n\n    # Check for koutsu with one draw\n    # If any two tiles are identical, drawing one more of that tile creates a koutsu.\n    # This is equivalent to checking if there are at least two identical tiles.\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] or tiles[1] == tiles[2]: # (t1==t2 or t2==t3)\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Check for shuntsu with one draw\n    # We need to find a pair of tiles (ti, tj) such that drawing one tile forms a shuntsu.\n    # This means ti and tj must be of the same suit and their numbers are n, n+1 or n, n+2.\n    \n    # Group tiles by suit\n    suits_data = {'m': [], 'p': [], 's': []}\n    for num, suit in tiles:\n        suits_data[suit].append(num)\n    \n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        nums_in_suit = sorted(list(set(suits_data[suit]))) # Use set to handle duplicates\n        \n        # If there are at least two distinct numbers in this suit\n        if len(nums_in_suit) >= 2:\n            for i in range(len(nums_in_suit)):\n                for j in range(i + 1, len(nums_in_suit)):\n                    n1, n2 = nums_in_suit[i], nums_in_suit[j]\n                    \n                    # Case: n, n+1.
