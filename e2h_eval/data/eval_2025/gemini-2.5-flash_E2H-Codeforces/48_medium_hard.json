            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this base conversion problem:**\n\nI need to write a Python script that takes a number `c` in base `a` and converts it to base `b`. The key twist is that `b` can be either an integer or the special character 'R' for Roman numerals.\n\nMy plan is to break this down into three main steps:\n\n1.  **Read the Input:** Parse the input line by line. I'll read `a`, `b` (which will be `b_str`), and `c` (which will be `c_str`).  `a` will be converted to an integer immediately.\n2.  **Convert to Decimal (Base 10):**  I'll write a function, `base_to_dec(num_str, base)`, to handle this. It will take the number represented as a string (`c_str`) and the base (`a`) as input and convert it to its decimal equivalent.  This is a standard base conversion, involving iterating through the digits (characters) of the input string, from right to left, and summing up the value of each digit multiplied by the appropriate power of the base.  I'll need a helper function `char_to_val(char)` to map characters ('0'-'9', 'A'-'Z') to their corresponding integer values.  I'll add some error handling to this to ensure the input is valid.\n3.  **Convert to Target Base:**\n    *   **Integer Base (`b` is an Integer):** If `b` is an integer, I'll need another function, `dec_to_base(dec_num, base)`, to convert the decimal number to the target base. This is the reverse of the previous step. This involves repeatedly dividing the decimal number by the target base and keeping track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, form the digits in the new base.  I'll need a helper function `val_to_char(val)` to map integers back to characters. I have to be careful about omitting leading zeros, but this is handled naturally in my `dec_to_base` function, except for 0. The description says input strings might have leading zeros. If the original string is just \"0\", after this process it should be just \"0\".\n    *   **Roman Numerals (`b` is 'R'):** If `b` is 'R', I'll call a function `dec_to_roman(dec_num)` to convert the decimal value to Roman numerals. Roman numerals have specific rules. I'll use a greedy algorithm, starting with the largest Roman numeral value and repeatedly subtracting it from the decimal number. I need to make sure to include subtractive combinations like \"CM\" (900) and \"IV\" (4) in my mapping to handle the subtractive principle correctly. I have to make sure the algorithm respects the constraint on the maximum value (<= 3000).  The problem statement mentions there won't be a 0 value when the target is Roman, so that case is easy.\n\nI also have to keep the constraints in mind: `2 <= a, b <= 25`,  the length of the number in base `a` up to `10^3`, and if Roman numerals are used, the input value is limited to `3000`. If `b` is an integer target, then `c` is limited to `10^15`.\n\nI'll write the code step-by-step, testing each function thoroughly. I can use the example inputs given to verify the correctness. I'll think about efficiency, even though the constraints seem manageable. The code will handle large numbers correctly because of Python's arbitrary-precision integers, but I will make the algorithms as efficient as possible.\n",
