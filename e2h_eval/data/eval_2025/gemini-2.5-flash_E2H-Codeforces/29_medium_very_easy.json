Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Substitutes in Number\" problem and devise a Python solution.**\n\nMy goal is to efficiently handle the string replacements while keeping track of the modulo arithmetic. The core of the issue is that straightforward string manipulation with numerous replacements can lead to exponential string growth and significant performance degradation.\n\nInitially, I considered a naive approach of directly simulating the replacements but quickly realized its inefficiency due to the potential exponential string growth. The crucial insight is to focus on the *numerical* value that each digit contributes to the final result, working with the number's modulo representation to avoid large numbers.\n\nI noticed that replacements are *global* for a specific digit. This led me to think about processing the queries in *reverse*. This means we calculate how each digit eventually becomes. By maintaining the value and length of each digit after transformations, we build up the result. For example, if '2' is replaced by \"00\" then by \"7\", we consider it from \"77\". However, the problem statement confirms that we *must* process queries in the order given (forward).\n\nTo address the length and modulo concerns, I’ll maintain `val[d]` and `len[d]` for each digit `d` (0-9). `val[d]` will represent the numeric value of the string that `d` currently represents modulo `M` (1000000007). `len[d]` will store the length of the string `d` represents, also managed using modulo `M-1`. This is necessary for efficient calculation of powers of 10. `10^L mod M` would be calculated with `pow(10, L % (M-1), M)`.\n\nWhen a query `di -> ti` comes, I'll calculate the new `val[di]` and `len[di]` by iterating through `ti` and considering the current `val` and `len` of each digit in `ti`. For an input digit `di`, if `ti` is \"10\", I need the value of 1 times power of ten length 0 plus the value of 0. This gives the resulting value of the given digit that it now transforms into, and so on and so on.\n\nThe main time complexity comes from `ti` and s length as a whole and log of the exponent used in `pow`. `O((sum(|ti|) + |s|) * log(M-1))`. This should be fast enough.\n\nI need to initialize and calculate properly, making sure to handle empty strings correctly. After processing all queries, I’ll iterate through the initial string `s`, replacing each digit with its current value and length to get the final result, being careful to use `pow` and keep track of length. All calculations will be modulo `M`.\n\nI am confident that this method accurately captures the transformations and meets the problem's requirements, handling the modular arithmetic and length issues efficiently.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to simulate a series of digit replacements in a string `s` and then calculate the numerical value of the final string modulo 1000000007. The replacements are sequential, meaning that a digit `d` replaced by a string `t` will cause any digits in `t` to be subject to *subsequent* replacement queries. This implies that the final form of each digit `0-9` depends on all queries.\n\nTo handle this efficiently without actually building the string (which could grow exponentially), we can use dynamic programming with reverse iteration. For each digit `d` from `0` to `9`, we want to know two things:\n1.  `current_val[d]`: The numerical value of the string that `d` eventually transforms into, modulo `M = 1000000007`.\n2.  `current_len[d]`: The length of the string that `d` eventually transforms into, modulo `M-1` (because we use this length as an exponent for powers of 10, and by Fermat's Little Theorem, `a^(M-1) % M = 1` for prime `M` and `a != 0`). We need to be careful with `current_len[d] = 0` representing an empty string; `pow(10, 0, M)` is `1`, which is correct for `10^0`.\n\n**Algorithm**:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Set `M = 1000000007`.\n    *   Set `MOD_EXPONENT = M - 1 = 1000000006`.\n    *   For each digit `d` from `0` to `9`:\n        *   `current_val[d] = d`\n        *   `current_len[d] = 1` (a single digit has length 1)\n\n2.  **Process Queries in Reverse**:\n    *   Read all `n` queries and store them.\n    *   Iterate through the queries from the *last* query to the *first*.\n    *   For each query `di -> ti`:\n        *   Initialize `new_val_di = 0` and `new_len_di = 0`.\n        *   Iterate through each character `char_c` in the string `ti` from left to right:\n            *   Convert `char_c` to an integer `digit_c`.\n            *   Update `new_val_di`: `new_val_di = (new_val_di * pow(10, current_len[digit_c], M) + current_val[digit_c]) % M`.\n                *   `pow(10, current_len[digit_c], M)` shifts the previously accumulated value to the left by the length of the string `digit_c` represents.\n            *   Update `new_len_di`: `new_len_di = (new_len_di + current_len[digit_c]) % MOD_EXPONENT`.\n        *   After processing all characters in `ti`, update `current_val[di] = new_val_di` and `current_len[di] = new_len_di`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Result**:\n    *   Initialize `final_answer = 0` and `total_length = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through each character `char_c` in the initial string `s` from left to right:\n        *   Convert `char_c` to an integer `digit_c`.\n        *   Update `final_answer`: `final_answer = (final_answer * pow(10, current_len[digit_c], M) + current_val[digit_c]) % M`.\n        *   Update `total_length`: `total_length = (total_length + current_len[digit_c]) % MOD_EXPONENT`.\n    *   The `final_answer` is the required result.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Third Sample):**\n`s = \"222\"`, queries: `2->0`, `0->7`\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    `M = 1000000007`, `MOD_EXPONENT = 1000000006`.\n    `current_val = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n    `current_len = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n2.  **Process Queries in Reverse**:\n    *   **Query 2 (last): `0 -> 7`**\n        `di = 0`, `ti = \"7\"`.\n        `new_val_0 = 0`, `new_len_0 = 0`.\n        Process `char_c = '7'`:\n            `digit_c = 7`.\n            `new_val_0 = (0 * pow(10, current_len[7], M) + current_val[7]) % M = (0 * 10^1 + 7) % M = 7`.\n            `new_len_0 = (0 + current_len[7]) % MOD_EXPONENT = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXPONENT = 1`.\n        Update: `current_val[0] = 7`, `current_len[0] = 1`.\n        `current_val` becomes `[7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n\n    *   **Query 1 (first): `2 -> 0`**\n        `di = 2`, `ti = \"0\"`.\n        `new_val_2 = 0`, `new_len_2 = 0`.\n        Process `char_c = '0'`:\n            `digit_c = 0`.\n            `new_val_2 = (0 * pow(10, current_len[0], M) + current_val[0]) % M = (0 * 10^1 + 7) % M = 7`.\n            `new_len_2 = (0 + current_len[0]) % MOD_EXPONENT = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXPONENT = 1`.\n        Update: `current_val[2] = 7`, `current_len[2] = 1`.\n        `current_val` becomes `[7, 1, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`\n\n3.  **Calculate Final Result for `s = \"222\"`**:\n    `final_answer = 0`, `total_length = 0`.\n    *   Process `char_c = '2'` (first digit of `s`):\n        `digit_c = 2`.\n        `final_answer = (0 * pow(10, current_len[2], M) + current_val[2]) % M = (0 * 10^1 + 7) % M = 7`.\n        `total_length = (0 + current_len[2]) % MOD_EXPONENT = (0 + 1) % MOD_EXPONENT = 1`.\n    *   Process `char_c = '2'` (second digit of `s`):\n        `digit_c = 2`.\n        `final_answer = (7 * pow(10, current_len[2], M) + current_val[2]) % M = (7 * 10^1 + 7) % M = 77`.\n        `total_length = (1 + current_len[2]) % MOD_EXPONENT = (1 + 1) % MOD_EXPONENT = 2`.\n    *   Process `char_c = '2'` (third digit of `s`):\n        `digit_c = 2`.\n        `final_answer = (77 * pow(10, current_len[2], M) + current_val[2]) % M = (77 * 10^1 + 7) % M = 777`.\n        `total_length = (2 + current_len[2]) % MOD_EXPONENT = (2 + 1) % MOD_EXPONENT = 3`.\n\nFinal answer: `777`. This matches the sample output.\n\n**Complexity**:\n*   Time: `O((sum(|ti|) + |s|) * log(M))`, where `sum(|ti|)` is the total length of replacement strings across all queries. Given `sum(|ti|) <= 10^5` and `|s| <= 10^5`, this is `(10^5 + 10^5) * log(10^9) approx 2 * 10^5 * 30`, which is efficient enough.\n*   Space: `O(sum(|ti|) + N)` for storing queries, plus `O(1)` for `current_val` and `current_len` arrays (10 elements each). This is also well within limits.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    queries_raw = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        queries_raw.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n\n    queries = []\n    for q_str in queries_raw:\n        di, ti = q_str.split(\"->\")\n        queries.append((int(di), ti))\n\n    M = 1000000007\n    MOD_EXPONENT = M - 1 # For Fermat's Little Theorem: a^(M-1) = 1 (mod M)\n\n    # current_val[d] stores the numerical value of the string that digit d\n    # eventually transforms into, modulo M.\n    # current_len[d] stores the length of the string that digit d\n    # eventually transforms into, modulo MOD_EXPONENT.\n    current_val = [i for i in range(10)]\n    current_len = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        di, ti = queries[i]\n\n        new_val_di = 0\n        new_len_di = 0\n\n        # Calculate the value and length for the replacement string ti\n        # based on the current (already processed for later queries) values\n        # and lengths of its constituent digits.\n        for char_c in ti:\n            digit_c = int(char_c)\n            \n            # The previous accumulated value (new_val_di) needs to be shifted\n            # to the left by the length of the string represented by digit_c.\n            # This is equivalent to multiplying by 10^(length of digit_c).\n            power_of_10 = pow(10, current_len[digit_c], M)\n            new_val_di = (new_val_di * power_of_10 + current_val[digit_c]) % M\n            \n            # Accumulate lengths, modulo MOD_EXPONENT\n            new_len_di = (new_len_di + current_len[digit_c]) % MOD_EXPONENT\n        \n        # Update current_val and current_len for the digit di being replaced\n        current_val[di] = new_val_di\n        current_len[di] = new_len_di\n\n    # Calculate the final answer from the initial string s\n    final_answer = 0\n    # total_length is not strictly needed for the final answer,\n    # but could be used for debugging or other calculations.\n    # total_length = 0 \n\n    for char_c in s:\n        digit_c = int(char_c)\n        \n        # Similar accumulation as for replacement strings\n        power_of_10 = pow(10, current_len[digit_c], M)\n        final_answer = (final_answer * power_of_10 + current_val[digit_c]) % M\n        \n        # total_length = (total_length + current_len[digit_c]) % MOD_EXPONENT\n\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_answer) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
