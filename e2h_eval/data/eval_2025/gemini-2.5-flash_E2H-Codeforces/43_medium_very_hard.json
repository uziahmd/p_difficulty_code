He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nMy initial thought is to devise a Python script to determine if a string `S` adheres to a specified set of string-formation rules. These rules are: the string begins with a non-empty sequence of 'a's (`N_a`), followed by a non-empty sequence of 'b's (`N_b`), and finally, a sequence of 'c's (`N_c`). The crucial constraint is that `N_c` must equal either `N_a` or `N_b`.\n\nI'll approach this by analyzing the structure of `S`, which must strictly be in the form \"a...ab...bc...c\". Any deviation from this (e.g., 'b' before 'a', 'c' before 'b') indicates the string is invalid. I'll count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's, labeling them `count_a`, `count_b`, and `count_c` respectively.\n\nTo verify the string structure, I'll iterate through `S` and confirm the 'a', 'b', and 'c' sequence. Initially, I'll expect to encounter 'a's, incrementing `count_a`. Upon encountering the first non-'a' character, I'll switch to expecting 'b's, incrementing `count_b`, and finally, I'll expect 'c's, incrementing `count_c`. The process naturally handles the order constraint: any character violating the expected sequence will lead to an immediate \"NO\" output.\n\nAfter counting, I'll check two conditions. First, the string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b' (`count_a >= 1` and `count_b >= 1`). Second, the number of 'c's (`count_c`) must be equal to either the number of 'a's (`count_a`) or the number of 'b's (`count_b`). If these conditions hold, the output is \"YES\", otherwise, it's \"NO\". I need to handle any cases where the string has no 'c's. This should be explicitly checked, and results in a \"NO\".\n\nDuring refinement, I've realized an efficient state-based approach simplifies the order checking. I'll maintain a `phase` variable (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', 2 for 'c'). In each phase, the code checks the current character against the expected character type. This approach handles both the order constraint and character-type validation in a concise manner.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed by a specific three-step process involving characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Let's break down the rules and derive the conditions for a valid string.\n\n**Rules for String Formation:**\n\n1.  **A's step**: A starts with a string of one or more 'a's. Let the number of 'a's be `N_a`. So, `N_a >= 1`. The string is `a...a`.\n2.  **B's step**: B appends one or more 'b's to the end. Let the number of 'b's be `N_b`. The problem states \"at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.\" Since `N_a` is already established as `>= 1`, this implies `N_b >= 1`. The string becomes `a...ab...b`.\n3.  **C's step**: C appends one or more 'c's to the end. Let the number of 'c's be `N_c`. The condition is that `N_c` must be equal to `N_a` OR `N_c` must be equal to `N_b`. It can also be both.\n    Crucially, since `N_a >= 1` and `N_b >= 1`, for `N_c` to be equal to either `N_a` or `N_b`, `N_c` must also be at least 1. If `N_c` were 0, it would imply `N_a=0` or `N_b=0`, contradicting the rule from B's step. So, `N_c >= 1`.\n\n**Summary of Derived Conditions:**\n\nFrom the rules, a valid string `S` must satisfy:\n1.  **Order**: The string must consist of a contiguous block of 'a's, followed by a contiguous block of 'b's, followed by a contiguous block of 'c's. No other characters are allowed, and characters cannot be out of order (e.g., 'b' before 'a', 'c' before 'b', 'a' after 'b', etc.).\n2.  **Counts**: Let `count_a`, `count_b`, `count_c` be the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in `S` respectively.\n    *   `count_a >= 1`\n    *   `count_b >= 1`\n    *   `count_c >= 1`\n    *   `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse and Count**: Iterate through the input string `S` to count `count_a`, `count_b`, and `count_c` while simultaneously checking the order.\n    *   Start by counting 'a's. If a character other than 'a' is encountered, stop counting 'a's.\n    *   Then, count 'b's from the current position. If a character other than 'b' is encountered, stop counting 'b's.\n    *   Finally, count 'c's from the current position. If a character other than 'c' is encountered, stop counting 'c's.\n2.  **Order Check**: After these three counting phases, if the iteration pointer has not reached the end of the string (`len(S)`), it means there were characters out of order (e.g., 'a' after 'b', 'b' after 'c', or any character other than 'a', 'b', 'c'). In this case, the string is invalid.\n3.  **Count Checks**: Apply the derived conditions on `count_a`, `count_b`, `count_c`:\n    *   If `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, or `count_c` is 0, the string is invalid.\n    *   If `count_c` is not equal to `count_a` AND `count_c` is not equal to `count_b`, the string is invalid.\n4.  **Output**: If all checks pass, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`aaabccc`):**\n\n1.  **Parse and Count**:\n    *   `S = \"aaabccc\"`, `n = 7`\n    *   `count_a = 0, count_b = 0, count_c = 0`\n    *   `i = 0`:\n        *   `S[0]='a'`, `count_a=1`, `i=1`\n        *   `S[1]='a'`, `count_a=2`, `i=2`\n        *   `S[2]='a'`, `count_a=3`, `i=3`\n        *   `S[3]='b'`, 'a' phase ends.\n    *   `i = 3`:\n        *   `S[3]='b'`, `count_b=1`, `i=4`\n        *   `S[4]='c'`, 'b' phase ends.\n    *   `i = 4`:\n        *   `S[4]='c'`, `count_c=1`, `i=5`\n        *   `S[5]='c'`, `count_c=2`, `i=6`\n        *   `S[6]='c'`, `count_c=3`, `i=7`\n        *   `i=7`, 'c' phase ends.\n2.  **Order Check**: `i` is 7, which equals `n`. Order is correct.\n3.  **Count Checks**:\n    *   `count_a = 3`, `count_b = 1`, `count_c = 3`.\n    *   `count_a >= 1` (3 >= 1) - True.\n    *   `count_b >= 1` (1 >= 1) - True.\n    *   `count_c >= 1` (3 >= 1) - True.\n    *   `count_c == count_a` (3 == 3) - True. (The OR condition is satisfied).\n4.  **Output**: All checks pass, print \"YES\".\n\nThis approach ensures `O(N)` time complexity, where `N` is the length of the string, which is efficient enough for `N` up to 5000.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(S)\n\n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    count_c = 0\n\n    i = 0\n\n    # Phase 0: Count 'a's\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'a':\n        count_a += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    # Phase 1: Count 'b's\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'b':\n        count_b += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    # Phase 2: Count 'c's\n    while i < n and S[i] == 'c':\n        count_c += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    # After iterating, 'i' should be equal to 'n'.\n    # If not, it means there are characters after the 'c' block,\n    # or characters out of order (e.g., 'a' after 'b', 'b' after 'c', etc.).\n    if i < n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Apply the rules based on counts:\n\n    # Rule: At least one 'a' and one 'b' must exist after A and B's steps.\n    # This means count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1.\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Rule: C appends 'c's.
