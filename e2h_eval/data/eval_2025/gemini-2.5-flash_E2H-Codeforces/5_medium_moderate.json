Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My plan for the Colored Boots problem:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Colored Boots\" coding problem. The core is to match up left and right boots based on color, maximizing the total pairs.  I've got `n` boots on each side, with colors that are lowercase letters or a '?'. Matching rules are straightforward: same letter matches, or a letter matches a '?'.\n\n**Breakdown of My Strategy:**\n\nFirst, I need to *understand the input*:  `n`, the number of boots, and the color strings `l` and `r`. The output is the maximum number of pairs, and the indices of those paired boots.\n\nMy *general approach* is greedy, aiming for the \"best\" matches first. Specifically:\n1.  **Exact Matches First**:  Prioritize pairing boots with *the exact same color*. These matches are the most restrictive.\n2.  **Specific Color with '?'**: Next, I'll match any remaining specific colored boots with the question mark boots.\n3.  **'?' with '?' Last**: Finally, if there are any unmatched '?' boots left, I pair them up. They're the most flexible, so I leave them for last.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n1.  **Data Structure**:  I'll use a `defaultdict(list)` for both left and right boots.  This is super convenient because it will store the indices of each boot, keyed by color. So `left_indices['a']` will be a list of *all* the indices of 'a' boots on the left side.\n\n2.  **Matching Process**:\n    *   **Step 1:** Loop through each letter 'a' to 'z'.  For each letter, while there are both left and right boots of that color, I'll *pair them up* and remove them from the lists.\n    *   **Step 2:** After exact matches, any *unmatched specific colors* will get matched with '?'. Again, I'll loop through the letters, trying to match any leftover left-side letter boots with right-side '?' and vice versa.\n    *   **Step 3:** The very end is to simply pair up any remaining '?' boots with each other.\n\n3.  **Efficiency**:  I need a solution that's fast.  The `defaultdict(list)` is O(1) for lookups and append operations, `pop()` from the end of a list is also O(1). So with these datastructures, the whole approach should be O(N), which is perfect.\n\n**Why Greedy Works:**\n\nI'm confident this greedy approach is optimal.  If I match an 'a' with an 'a', I'm getting the *most restrictive* pair out of the way, maximizing the chances of pairing up more boots overall. By matching any specific boots with '?' later, I can ensure that a boot with a *more restricted* color gets to find *at least one valid pairing*. This keeps the option to pair more boots down the line.\n\n**Refinements:**\nUsing Python's `string.ascii_lowercase` would make the code a bit cleaner than the `ord('a') to ord('z')` approach. I also did a careful dry-run. I think I have a clean solution now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. We are given `n` left boots and `n` right boots, with their colors. Colors can be specific (lowercase Latin letters) or indefinite ('?'). Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any specific or indefinite color (e.g., '?', 'z'; 'a', '?'; '?', '?').\n\nA boot can be part of at most one pair. We need to output the total number of pairs and the 1-indexed indices of the boots in each pair.\n\n**Strategy: Greedy Approach**\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs, we should prioritize matching boots that are most restrictive in their compatibility options. This leaves the more flexible boots ('?') available for as many matches as possible. The priority order is:\n\n1.  **Exact specific color matches:** Match a left boot of color `C` with a right boot of color `C`. These boots are the most restrictive because they can only directly match another boot of color `C` or a `'?'` boot. By matching `C` with `C`, we satisfy a restrictive requirement without using up a flexible `'?'` boot.\n\n2.  **Specific color with indefinite color ('?'):** After all possible exact specific matches are made, some specific-colored boots might remain (e.g., a left 'a' boot but no right 'a' boot left). These remaining specific-colored boots can only be matched with a `'?'` boot. We should prioritize these matches over matching two `'?'` boots together, because a specific-colored boot *needs* a `'?'` if it can't find an exact match, whereas a `'?'` boot can match anything.\n\n    This step involves two sub-parts:\n    a. Match remaining left specific-colored boots with available right `'?'` boots.\n    b. Match remaining right specific-colored boots with available left `'?'` boots.\n\n3.  **Indefinite color with indefinite color ('?'):** Finally, any remaining left `'?'` boots can be matched with any remaining right `'?'` boots. These are the least restrictive matches and are done last.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n1.  **Store Boot Indices:** Use `defaultdict(list)` to store the 1-indexed indices of boots for each color. For example, `left_indices['a']` would be a list of indices of all left boots with color 'a'. This allows easy access and removal of boots.\n\n2.  **Process in Priority Order:**\n    *   Iterate through all lowercase letters ('a' through 'z'). For each character `c`, while there are `left_indices[c]` and `right_indices[c]`, pop an index from each list and add the pair to our result list.\n    *   Again, iterate through 'a' through 'z'. For each character `c`:\n        *   While there are `left_indices[c]` and `right_indices['?']`, pop an index from each and form a pair.\n        *   While there are `right_indices[c]` and `left_indices['?']`, pop an index from each and form a pair.\n    *   Finally, while there are `left_indices['?']` and `right_indices['?']`, pop an index from each and form a pair.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n\n`n = 10`\n`l = codeforces`\n`r = dodivthree`\n\n1.  **Initialize `left_indices` and `right_indices`:**\n    `left_indices = {'c': [1, 8], 'o': [2, 6], 'd': [3], 'e': [4, 9], 'f': [5], 'r': [7], 's': [10], '?': []}`\n    `right_indices = {'d': [1, 3], 'o': [2], 'i': [4], 'v': [5], 't': [6], 'h': [7], 'r': [8], 'e': [9, 10], '?': []}`\n    `pairs = []`\n\n2.  **Step 1: Exact specific color matches:**\n    *   'd': `l[3]` and `r[3]` (or `r[1]`). Let's say `(3, 3)`. `left_indices['d']` becomes `[]`, `right_indices['d']` becomes `[1]`.\n    *   'e': `l[9]` and `r[10]`, then `l[4]` and `r[9]`. `(9, 10)`, `(4, 9)`. `left_indices['e']` and `right_indices['e']` become `[]`.\n    *   'o': `l[6]` and `r[2]`. `(6, 2)`. `left_indices['o']` becomes `[2]`, `right_indices['o']` becomes `[]`.\n    *   'r': `l[7]` and `r[8]`. `(7, 8)`. `left_indices['r']` and `right_indices['r']` become `[]`.\n    *   No other exact matches.\n    `pairs = [(3, 3), (9, 10), (4, 9), (6, 2), (7, 8)]` (order may vary)\n\n3.  **Step 2: Specific color with '?' boots:**\n    `left_indices['?']` and `right_indices['?']` are both empty. So, no matches are made in this step.\n\n4.  **Step 3: '?' with '?' boots:**\n    `left_indices['?']` and `right_indices['?']` are both empty. So, no matches are made.\n\nTotal pairs: 5. The output would be 5 and the pairs found. This matches the example's count and provides a valid set of pairs.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N) for populating the `defaultdict`s and O(26 * N) effectively for iterating through characters and popping indices. Since `N` is up to 150,000, `26 * N` is still dominated by `N` in terms of total operations (each boot index is added and removed at most once). So, the total time complexity is O(N).\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store all boot indices in the `defaultdict`s and the resulting pairs.\n\nThis approach is efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport string\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Store 1-indexed indices of boots for each color\n    left_indices = defaultdict(list)\n    right_indices = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_indices[l_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n        right_indices[r_str[i]].append(i + 1)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors with exact specific colors\n    # Iterate through all lowercase letters\n    for char in string.ascii_lowercase:\n        while left_indices[char] and right_indices[char]:\n            l_idx = left_indices[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices[char].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Step 2: Match remaining specific colors with '?' boots\n    # First, left specific boots with right '?' boots\n    for char in string.ascii_lowercase:\n        while left_indices[char] and right_indices['?']:\n            l_idx = left_indices[char].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n    \n    # Then, right specific boots with left '?' boots\n    for char in string.ascii_lowercase:\n        while right_indices[char] and left_indices['?']:\n            l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()\n            r_idx = right_indices[char].pop()\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Step 3: Match remaining '?' boots with '?' boots\n    while left_indices['?'] and right_indices['?']:\n        l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop()\n        r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop()\n        pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n\n    # Print the results\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(pairs)) + '\\n')\n    for l_idx, r_idx in pairs:\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"{l_idx} {r_idx}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
