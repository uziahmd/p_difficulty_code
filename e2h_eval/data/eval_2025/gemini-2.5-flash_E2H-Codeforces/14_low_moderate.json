He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Trailing Zeroes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to find all the numbers `n` whose factorial (`n!`) ends with exactly `m` zeroes. The output should be the count of such `n` values and the values themselves, in ascending order.  I'm already thinking about how to translate this into Python.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core concept: trailing zeroes are determined by the number of factors of 10 in the prime factorization of `n!`. Since 10 = 2 * 5, and the number of 2s is always greater than or equal to the number of 5s, the number of trailing zeroes is essentially the number of 5s.\n\nNow, Legendre's formula comes to mind. It provides a way to calculate the number of factors of 5 in `n!`: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`. I'll need to keep adding terms until `5^k` exceeds `n`.\n\nAnalyzing `Z(n)` is key. I know it's non-decreasing; as `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or goes up. It only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5, but it jumps in value at multiples of powers of 5 (25, 125, etc.). For instance, going from 4! to 5! adds one trailing zero, but going from 24! to 25! adds two trailing zeroes because of that extra 25 factor (two 5s).\n\nMy current intuition is that if `Z(n) = m`, then several consecutive `n` values are going to have the same number of trailing zeros. This is going to be important in searching for the answer. I have to be careful though. Let's see. `Z(4) = 0`, `Z(5) = 1`, and `Z(10) = 2`. The values from 5 to 9 all will have only one trailing zero. Also 10 to 14, two trailing zeroes. It jumps from n = 5 to n = 6. \n\nEssentially, if I find one `n` where `Z(n) = m`, I know I'll have a set of consecutive numbers with that same trailing zero count. I think I can use this property to optimize my search. Also, I know I can start my search for `n` from `5m` since that is the least possible value for `n`. I should try to write out a script based on this approach.\n",
