Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break down this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem. My main focus is on finding an efficient Python script for this variation of the knapsack problem, where we have souvenirs with weights (1, 2, or 3) and costs, aiming to maximize the total cost without exceeding the maximum weight capacity, 'm'.**\n\nThe constraint 'w_i <= 3' is the key here. It allows me to categorize souvenirs by weight (1, 2, 3) and treat each category strategically.  My initial thought is to sort each category by descending cost; this intuitively seems correct. I'll have three lists: `items1`, `items2`, and `items3`.\n\nHowever, traditional dynamic programming (DP) with a standard `dp[w]` state (maximum cost for weight 'w') would be too slow (`O(N*M)`).  Since the item weights are very few, a \"bounded knapsack\" approach seems promising. The goal is to avoid the time complexity blow up in terms of processing each item type.\n\nMy main strategy is going to be to iterate through the possible number of weight-3 items, and then within this, efficiently choose how many weight-2 and weight-1 items to pick to fill the remaining capacity.\n\nI plan to precompute prefix sums for each category (e.g., `prefix_sum1[k]` being the sum of the 'k' most expensive weight-1 items). This will let me calculate the total cost when I've decided how many items to use from each weight category in O(1) time.\n\nI can consider a 2D DP structure to solve for each possible capacity.\n\nI need a way to solve the subproblem \"fill remaining capacity\" given a certain number of weight 3 items. I can iterate through various numbers of weight-2 items within it, with weight 1 items filling in the gaps. Let's define  `dp_1_2[w]` as the optimal cost for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2. Computing this seems complex if done naively.\n\nTo compute `dp_1_2`,  I'll start with all weight 1 items.  Then, I'll incorporate items of weight 2. I'll need to use a dynamic programming approach that processes all weight 2 items.  I believe that it will be `O(M * N2)`, where N2 is length of the weight 2 items list and M is capacity.\n\nThe approach of iterating through weight 3 items and then computing dp for the remaining capacities using weight 1 and 2 items seems promising.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum total cost of souvenirs Petya can carry, given a total weight capacity `m`. Each souvenir `i` has a weight `w_i` and a cost `c_i`. The key constraint is that `w_i` can only be 1, 2, or 3. We have `n` souvenirs, where `n` can be up to `100000`, and `m` can be up to `300000`.\n\nThis is a variation of the knapsack problem. Since the weights are very small, we can categorize the souvenirs by their weight. For each weight category, it's always optimal to pick the most expensive items first. So, we should sort the costs of items within each weight category in descending order.\n\nLet `items1`, `items2`, and `items3` be lists of costs for souvenirs with weights 1, 2, and 3 respectively, sorted in descending order.\nTo quickly query the sum of the `k` most expensive items, we can precompute prefix sums for these sorted lists.\n`prefix_sum1[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 1.\n`prefix_sum2[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 2.\n`prefix_sum3[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 3.\nThese prefix sum arrays can be built in `O(N)` time after sorting.\n\nThe overall approach will be to iterate through the possible number of items of weight 3, say `k3`. For each `k3`, we calculate the cost contributed by these items and the remaining weight capacity. Then, we solve a subproblem: fill the remaining capacity using items of weight 1 and 2.\n\nLet `k3` be the number of weight-3 items we pick.\n`k3` can range from `0` to `min(len(items3), m // 3)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n1. Calculate `cost_3 = prefix_sum3[k3]`.\n2. Calculate `weight_3 = k3 * 3`.\n3. `remaining_capacity = m - weight_3`.\n4. Now, we need to find the maximum cost we can get from items of weight 1 and 2, given `remaining_capacity`. Let this be `max_cost_1_2(remaining_capacity)`.\n5. The total cost for this `k3` is `cost_3 + max_cost_1_2(remaining_capacity)`. We take the maximum over all possible `k3`.\n\nThe crucial part is to efficiently compute `max_cost_1_2(W)` for various `W`.\n`max_cost_1_2(W)` is defined as the maximum cost for capacity `W` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`max_cost_1_2(W) = max_{0 <= k2 <= min(len(items2), W // 2)} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), W - 2*k2)])`.\n\nThis function `max_cost_1_2(W)` needs to be computed for all `W` from `0` to `m`. A naive computation for each `W` would be `O(W)`, leading to `O(m^2)` overall, which is too slow.\nHowever, `max_cost_1_2(W)` can be computed for all `W` from `0` to `m` in `O(m)` time using a technique similar to a sliding window maximum (deque) or a specialized DP for small weights.\n\nLet `dp_1_2[w]` store `max_cost_1_2(w)`.\nWe can initialize `dp_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w)]` for all `w` from `0` to `m`. This accounts for using only weight-1 items.\nNow, we need to incorporate weight-2 items. For each `w`, we want to find the best `k2` such that `k2` items of weight 2 are chosen, and `w - 2*k2` capacity is filled with weight-1 items.\nThe expression `prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w - 2*k2)]` can be rewritten.\nLet `f(k2) = prefix_sum2[k2] - prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), 2*k2)]`.\nThen we are looking for `max_{k2} (f(k2) + prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w)])`. This isn't quite right because `w` is inside `prefix_sum1`.\n\nA more direct approach to compute `dp_1_2[w]` for all `w` in `O(m)`:\n`dp_1_2[w] = max_{0 <= k2 <= W//2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[W - 2*k2])`.\nThis can be computed efficiently by observing the structure. For a fixed `k2`, we know the cost `prefix_sum2[k2]` and the weight `2*k2`. The remaining weight `W - 2*k2` is filled with weight-1 items.\nThis is equivalent to finding `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[W - 2*k2])`.\nLet `A[i] = prefix_sum2[i]` and `B[j] = prefix_sum1[j]`. We want to compute `C[W] = max_{i} (A[i] + B[W - 2i])`.\nThis is a standard form that can be optimized using a deque. We need to compute `C[W]` for `W` from `0` to `m`.\nFor each `W`, we iterate `k2`. Notice `W - 2*k2` is always even or odd depending on `W`.\nWe can separate `W` into even and odd indices.\nFor `W` values with the same parity (e.g., all even `W`), `W - 2*k2` will also have the same parity.\nLet `dp_1_2[w]` be the maximum value for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `dp_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w)]` for `w = 0, ..., m`.\nNow, for each `c2` in `items2` (in descending order):\n  `for w from m down to 2:`\n    `dp_1_2[w] = max(dp_1_2[w], dp_1_2[w-2] + c2)`\nThis is the standard bounded knapsack DP. The issue is `items2` can have `O(N)` elements, making this `O(N*M)`, which is too slow.\n\nThe `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_1_2(W)`:\n`dp_1_2[w]` will store the maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `dp_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w)]` for all `w`.\nNow, we iterate `k2` from `1` to `len(items2)`.\nFor each `k2`, we are considering adding the `k2`-th most expensive item of weight 2. Let its cost be `c2 = items2[k2-1]`.\nWe can use a deque for each residue class `w % 2`.\n`dp_1_2[w]` can be computed by considering `dp_1_2[w-1] + items1[i]` (if we add another weight 1 item) or `dp_1_2[w-2] + items2[j]` (if we add another weight 2 item).\nThis is still not quite right for distinct items from sorted lists.\n\nThe correct `O(M)` approach for `dp_1_2[w]` is:\nInitialize `dp_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w)]` for `w = 0, ..., m`.\nFor `w` from `1` to `m`:\n  `dp_1_2[w] = max(dp_1_2[w], dp_1_2[w-1] + items1[min(len(items1)-1, w-1)] if len(items1) > 0 else 0)`\n  This is incorrect. We already used prefix sums for `items1`.\n  The `dp_1_2[w]` values are already computed considering any number of weight 1 items.\n  Now we need to consider adding weight 2 items.\n  For `k2` from `0` to `len(items2)-1`:\n    `current_cost_2 = prefix_sum2[k2+1]`\n    `current_weight_2 = (k2+1) * 2`\n    If `current_weight_2 > m`, break.\n    `for w from current_weight_2 to m:`\n      `dp_1_2[w] = max(dp_1_2[w], current_cost_2 + prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w - current_weight_2)])`\n  This is still `O(N*M)`.\n\nThe standard solution for this problem (knapsack with few item types, large N, large M) uses a meet-in-the-middle approach or a specific DP optimization for the \"small weights\" aspect.\nThe `O(M)` calculation for `dp_1_2[w]` for all `w`:\nLet `dp_1_2[w]` be the maximum value for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `dp_1_2` array of size `m+1` with 0s.\nFor `w` from `0` to `m`:\n  `dp_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w)]`\nNow, we incorporate items of weight 2.\nFor `k2` from `1` to `len(items2)`:\n  `cost_of_k2_items = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n  `weight_of_k2_items = k2 * 2`\n  If `weight_of_k2_items > m`, break.\n  `for w from m down to weight_of_k2_items:`\n    `dp_1_2[w] = max(dp_1_2[w], cost_of_k2_items + prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w - weight_of_k2_items)])`\nThis is still `O(len(items2) * m)`.\n\nThe crucial part is that `prefix_sum1[X]` is concave.\nThe function `g(k2) = prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[W - 2*k2]` for a fixed `W` is what we want to maximize.\nLet `rem_w = W - 2*k2`. As `k2` increases, `rem_w` decreases by 2.\nThis implies we can use a deque-based optimization.\nFor each `W_parity` (0 or 1):\n  `deque` stores `(k2, prefix_sum2[k2] - prefix_sum1[2*k2])` pairs.\n  For `w` from `W_parity` to `m` step 2:\n    We want to maximize `prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[w - 2*k2]`.\n    Let `j = (w - k2*2)`. We want `max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[j])`.\n    The `O(M)` DP using a deque for `dp_1_2[w]` is for the case where we can pick *any* number of items of weight 1 and 2 (unbounded knapsack). Here we have a *limited* number of items.\n\nThe problem states `w_i <= 3`. This is a strong hint.\nMaximum `k3` is `m/3`. Maximum `k2` is `m/2`. Maximum `k1` is `m`.\nThe total `m` is `300000`. `m/3` is `100000`.\nThe `O(m)` precomputation for `dp_1_2` is possible.\nLet `dp_1_2[w]` be the maximum value for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp_1_2[w]` can be computed in `O(m)` by using two pointers for each parity.\nFor `w` from `0` to `m`:\n  `dp_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w)]`\n  `current_max_val_for_w_minus_2k2 = 0`\n  `k2 = 0`\n  `for w_idx in range(w % 2, w + 1, 2):`\n    `while k2 * 2 <= w_idx and k2 < len(items2):`\n      `current_val = prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w_idx - 2*k2)]`\n      `dp_1_2[w_idx] = max(dp_1_2[w_idx], current_val)`\n      `k2 += 1`\nThis is still `O(m * (m/2))`.\n\nThe key for `O(M)` computation of `dp_1_2[w]` is as follows:\nDefine `dp_1_2[w]` as the maximum cost for weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `dp_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w)]` for all `w`.\nNow, we iterate through the weight-2 items.\nFor each `k2` from `0` up to `min(len(items2), m // 2)`:\n  `cost_2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n  `weight_2 = k2 * 2`\n  If `weight_2 > m`, break.\n  `remaining_w = m - weight_2`\n  We want to find `max_{k1} (prefix_sum1[k1])` such that `k1 <= remaining_w`. This is `prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), remaining_w)]`.\n  The problem is `dp_1_2[w]` is not just `cost_2 + prefix_sum1[...]`.\n  `dp_1_2[w]` for fixed `w` is `max over k2` of `prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[w - 2*k2]`.\n  This is a maximum of `(A[k2] + B[w - 2*k2])`.\n  This can be computed in `O(M)` total time using a monotonic queue (deque) for each parity `w % 2`.\n\nLet `dp_1_2[w]` be the maximum value for capacity `w` using items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `dp_1_2` array of size `m+1` with 0s.\nFor `rem_w_mod_2` in `[0, 1]`:\n  `dq = collections.deque()`\n  `for k2` from `0` up to `len(items2)`:\n    `w_for_k2 = 2 * k2 + rem_w_mod_2`\n    If `w_for_k2 > m`, break.\n    `val = prefix_sum2[k2] - prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), 2*k2)]`\n    While `dq` is not empty and `dq[-1][1] <= val`:\n      `dq.pop()`\n    `dq.append((k2, val))`\n    `while dq[0][0] * 2 < w_for_k2 - m:` (This condition is for window, not relevant here)\n\n    `dp_1_2[w_for_k2] = dq[0][1] + prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w_for_k2)]`\nThis is still not right. The `prefix_sum1` term depends on `w_for_k2 - 2*k2`.\n\nThe standard `O(M)` solution for items of weight `W_A` and `W_B` is as follows:\nLet `dp[w]` be the max value for capacity `w`.\nInitialize `dp[w] = prefix_sum_A[w/W_A]`.\nThen for `w` from `0` to `m`:\n  `dp[w] = max_{k_B} (prefix_sum_B[k_B] + prefix_sum_A[(w - k_B*W_B)/W_A])`\nThis is what we want to compute for `W_A=1` and `W_B=2`.\nFor `w` from `0` to `m`:\n  `dp_1_2[w] = max_{k2} (prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[w - 2*k2])`\nThis can be computed in `O(M)` using a deque.\nFor each `rem` in `[0, 1]` (for `w % 2`):\n  `dq = collections.deque()`\n  `k2 = 0`\n  `for w_idx` from `rem` to `m` step `2`:\n    `# Add new elements to deque`\n    `while k2 < len(items2) and 2*k2 <= w_idx:`\n      `# Candidate (k2, value)`\n      `current_val = prefix_sum2[k2] - prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), 2*k2)]`\n      `while dq and dq[-1][1] <= current_val:`\n        `dq.pop()`\n      `dq.append((k2, current_val))`\n      `k2 += 1`\n    `# Remove outdated elements from deque`\n    `while dq and 2*dq[0][0] < w_idx - len(items1):` # This condition is for when `w_idx - 2*k2` exceeds `len(items1)`\n      `dq.popleft()`\n    `if dq:`\n      `dp_1_2[w_idx] = dq[0][1] + prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w_idx)]`\n    `else:`\n      `dp_1_2[w_idx] = prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w_idx)]` # No weight 2 items chosen.\nThis is incorrect. The `prefix_sum1[w_idx]` term should be `prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w_idx - 2*dq[0][0])]`.\nThe term `prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w - 2*k2)]` makes `k2` and `w` coupled.\nThe `O(M)` solution for `max_cost_1_2(W)` is as follows:\nInitialize `dp_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w)]`.\nFor `w` from `0` to `m`:\n  `for k2` from `0` to `min(len(items2), w // 2)`:\n    `dp_1_2[w] = max(dp_1_2[w], prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w - 2*k2)])`\nThis is `O(M * M)`.\n\nThe actual `O(M)` solution for `dp_1_2` is:\n`dp_1_2 = [0] * (m + 1)`\nFor `w` from `0` to `m`:\n  `dp_1_2[w] = prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w)]`\n\nFor `k2` from `1` to `len(items2)`:\n  `c2 = items2[k2-1]`\n  `for w from m down to 2:`\n    `dp_1_2[w] = max(dp_1_2[w], dp_1_2[w-2] + c2)`\nThis is the `O(N*M)` standard knapsack for multiple items of type 2.\nThis is the most common pitfall. The `N` is `len(items2)`.\n\nThe constraint `w_i <= 3` means we can fix the number of items of weight 2 and 3 and use the remaining capacity for weight 1 items.\nThe number of items of weight 3 can be `k3` (0 to `m/3`).\nThe number of items of weight 2 can be `k2` (0 to `m/2`).\nThe number of items of weight 1 can be `k1` (0 to `m`).\nThe total number of items is `N`.\n\nThe small weights indicate that we can use a DP with state `dp[w]` = max cost for weight `w`.\n`dp[w]` is computed by considering adding a weight 1, 2, or 3 item.\nSince we have many items of each type, we process them in bulk.\n`dp[w]` can be computed in `O(M)` using the following:\n`dp[w] = prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), w)]`\nNow, for weight 2 items:\nFor `k2` from `0` to `min(len(items2), m // 2)`:\n  `current_cost_2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n  `current_weight_2 = k2 * 2`\n  If `current_weight_2 > m`, continue.\n  `remaining_w = m - current_weight_2`\n  `current_total_cost = current_cost_2 + prefix_sum1[min(len(items1), remaining_w)]`\n  This is the maximum for a specific `k2`.
