    "thought": "**Dynamic Programming for Binary String Multiset Counting**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling a competitive programming problem where the goal is to count the number of ways to build a \"beautiful multiset\" of binary strings, subject to some capacity constraints. I'm focusing on crafting a Python solution.\n\nEssentially, I'm given an integer `n` and a set of capacities `c_s` for all binary strings `s` from length 1 up to `n`. A beautiful multiset `M` is one where, for any prefix `s`, the number of strings in `M` that start with `s` doesn't exceed `c_s`. I want to know how many such multisets can result in the maximum possible size, `f`.\n\nI've determined that this problem can be reframed using a trie (prefix tree). Each node represents a binary string. The capacity `c_s` at a node defines the upper bound on the number of strings in the multiset that can have `s` as a prefix. I'm aiming to maximize the total number of strings of length `n` in the multiset.\n\nMy approach will leverage dynamic programming. I'll define `dp[L][val]` as the number of ways to assign capacity values to strings up to length `L`, such that the maximum flow (or the size of the multiset) is `val`. This is a bottom-up DP.\n\nThe base case is for strings of length `n`. For a string `s` of length `n`, `dp[n][val]` is simply 1 if `val` is within the valid range (0 to `k`, where `k` is a given constant), and 0 otherwise.\n\nFor a string of length `L < n`, I recursively calculate `dp[L][target_val]` in terms of the number of ways the subtree of `s` (the string) can be formed. It is calculated through the combination of its two children's subtrees' `dp` values through a convolution. Crucially, I calculate the `dp` values for the individual subtrees and then convolve them to obtain the total. I use fast Fourier transform for the convolution.\n\nThe crucial constraint to check is `min(c_s, V_{s0}+V_{s1}) <= c_s`.\n\nThe maximum size is then the sum of the maximum flows from two nodes at the top level of trie, string 0, and string 1. The final answer will be determined by convoluting the `dp[1]` array.\n\nThe time complexity is `O(n * k log k)`, where `n` is the string length, and `k` is the maximum allowed count for each prefix. The code will employ the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for fast polynomial multiplication. I should be able to account for different `c_s` values and count the valid combinations within the given constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers `c_s` for every binary string `s` of length from 1 to `n` (where each `c_s` is between 0 and `k`), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined given a set of `c_s` values. A multiset `M` of binary strings of length exactly `n` is beautiful if for every binary string `s` (length 1 to `n`), the number of strings in `M` that have `s` as a prefix does not exceed `c_s`.\n\nLet `x_t` be the number of times a string `t` (of length `n`) appears in the multiset `M`. We want to maximize `sum(x_t)`.\nFor any string `s` of length `L` (1 <= `L` <= `n`), let `V_s = sum(x_t)` for all strings `t` of length `n` that have `s` as a prefix. The condition is `V_s <= c_s`.\n\nThis problem has a structure that can be solved using dynamic programming on a conceptual binary tree (trie) of strings. Each node in the trie represents a string `s`. The leaves are strings of length `n`.\nFor a leaf node `s` (length `n`), `V_s = x_s`. So, `x_s <= c_s`. To maximize `x_s`, we choose `x_s = c_s`.\nFor an internal node `s` (length `L < n`), its children are `s0` and `s1`. The strings `t` that have `s` as a prefix are exactly those that have `s0` as a prefix or `s1` as a prefix. Thus, `V_s = V_{s0} + V_{s1}`.\nCombining this with the constraint `V_s <= c_s`, we get `V_s = min(c_s, V_{s0} + V_{s1})`.\nThe maximum size of the multiset is `V_0 + V_1` (where `0` and `1` are the strings of length 1).\n\nWe can use dynamic programming. Let `dp[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_{s'}` for all strings `s'` in the subtree of *a specific node* `s` at level `L` (representing a string of length `L`), such that the maximum possible `V_s` (sum of `x_t` for leaves in `s`'s subtree) is `val`.\nSince all nodes at the same level `L` are symmetric, `dp[L][val]` is the same for any string `s` of length `L`.\n\nThe DP proceeds from `L=n` down to `L=1`.\n**Base Case: `L=n` (leaf nodes)**\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `V_s = c_s`. Since `c_s` can be chosen from `0` to `k`, there is 1 way to choose `c_s = val`.\nSo, `dp[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`. All other `dp[n][val]` are 0.\n\n**Recursive Step: `L < n`**\nTo compute `dp[L][target_val]`, we consider a node `s` at level `L`. Its children `s0` and `s1` are at level `L+1`.\n`V_s = min(c_s, V_{s0} + V_{s1})`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `V_{s0} = val_0` is `dp[L+1][val_0]`.\nThe number of ways to achieve `V_{s1} = val_1` is `dp[L+1][val_1]`.\nLet `S_sum[sum_val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_{s'}` in the subtrees of `s0` and `s1` such that `V_{s0} + V_{s1} = sum_val`. This is a convolution:\n`S_sum[sum_val] = sum_{val_0 + val_1 = sum_val} (dp[L+1][val_0] * dp[L+1][val_1]) % MOD`.\nThe maximum possible `sum_val` is `2k`. This convolution can be computed efficiently using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT).\n\nOnce `S_sum` is computed, we determine `dp[L][target_val]` by considering `c_s`. `c_s` can be chosen from `0` to `k`.\nFor a fixed `sum_val` (from `S_sum`), we need `min(c_s, sum_val) = target_val`.\n1. If `target_val < sum_val`: Then `c_s` must be `target_val`. There is 1 choice for `c_s`.\n2. If `target_val = sum_val`: Then `c_s` can be any value from `target_val` to `k`. There are `k - target_val + 1` choices for `c_s`.\n3. If `target_val > sum_val`: This is impossible, as `min(c_s, sum_val)` cannot exceed `sum_val`.\n\nSo, `dp[L][target_val]` is calculated as:\n`dp[L][target_val] = (S_sum[target_val] * (k - target_val + 1)) % MOD` (from case 2)\n`+ sum_{sum_val = target_val+1}^{2k} (S_sum[sum_val] * 1) % MOD` (from case 1)\nThe sum `sum_{sum_val = target_val+1}^{2k} S_sum[sum_val]` is a suffix sum. We can precompute suffix sums of `S_sum` for efficiency. Let `SuffixS_sum[x] = sum_{j=x}^{2k} S_sum[j]`.\nThen, `dp[L][target_val] = (S_sum[target_val] * (k - target_val + 1) + SuffixS_sum[target_val + 1]) % MOD`.\n\nThe maximum value for `val` in `dp[L][val]` is `k`. The maximum value for `sum_val` in `S_sum` is `2k`.\nThe DP proceeds `n-1` times (from `L=n-1` down to `L=1`). In each step:\n1. Convolution using NTT: `O(k log k)`.\n2. Suffix sums: `O(k)`.\n3. `dp[L]` calculation: `O(k)`.\nTotal time complexity: `O(n * k log k)`. Given `n <= 15` and `k <= 2*10^5`, this is feasible (`15 * 2*10^5 * log(4*10^5) approx 15 * 2*10^5 * 19 approx 5.7 * 10^7`).\n\nAfter computing `dp[1]`, we have the number of ways to achieve `V_0 = val_0` and `V_1 = val_1`. The total maximum multiset size is `V_0 + V_1`. We need this to be exactly `f`.\nSo, the final answer is `sum_{val_0 + val_1 = f} (dp[1][val_0] * dp[1][val_1]) % MOD`.\nThis is again a convolution of `dp[1]` with itself, evaluated at index `f`.\n\n**NTT Implementation Details:**\nThe modulus `MOD = 998244353` is a prime number suitable for NTT. Its primitive root is `PRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3`.\nThe length of the NTT arrays should be a power of 2, greater than or equal to `2k+1` (for `S_sum`) or `k+1` (for `dp[L]`). For `k=2*10^5`, `2k+1 = 400001`, so an NTT length of `2^{19} = 524288` is appropriate.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Standard NTT setup for 998244353\nMOD = 998244353\nPRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\ndef ntt(a, invert):\n    n = len(a)\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        bit = n >> 1\n        while j >= bit:\n            j -= bit\n            bit >>= 1\n        j += bit\n        if i < j:\n            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n    len_block = 2\n    while len_block <= n:\n        wlen = pow(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // len_block, MOD)\n        if invert:\n            wlen = pow(wlen, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        \n        for i in range(0, n, len_block):\n            w = 1\n            for j in range(len_block // 2):\n                u = a[i + j]\n                v = (a[i + j + len_block // 2] * w) % MOD\n                a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                a[i + j + len_block // 2] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n        len_block <<= 1\n\n    if invert:\n        inv_n = pow(n, MOD - 2, MOD)\n        for i in range(n):\n            a[i] = (a[i] * inv_n) % MOD\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    len_a = len(a)\n    len_b = len(b)\n    result_len = len_a + len_b - 1\n    \n    ntt_len = 1\n    while ntt_len < result_len:\n        ntt_len <<= 1\n    \n    A = list(a) + [0] * (ntt_len - len_a)\n    B = list(b) + [0] * (ntt_len - len_b)\n    \n    ntt(A, False)\n    ntt(B, False)\n    \n    C = [(A[i] * B[i]) % MOD for i in range(ntt_len)]\n    \n    ntt(C, True)\n    \n    return C[:result_len]\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[val] stores the number of ways to choose c_s' in a subtree\n    # such that the max flow through the subtree is 'val'.\n    # For L=n, V_s = c_s.
