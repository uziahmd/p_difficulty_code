She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Browser\" Problem for a Python Solution**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to tackle this \"Browser\" problem.  Let's break down my thought process. The core is figuring out the *most efficient* way to close tabs, given a set of parameters: `n` (total tabs), `pos` (cursor position), and `l` and `r` (the \"keep open\" range). The task is straightforward: minimize the seconds needed to get *only* tabs `l` through `r` open.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about the possible actions: moving the cursor left or right, or closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor. Each takes a second.  Crucially, `a` and `b` represent the *min* and *max* indices of *unclosed* tabs, which shift as tabs close.\n\nThe goal state is clear: I need to get rid of tabs `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]` (assuming `l > 1` and `r < n`). The simplest scenarios help me clarify things. If `l = 1` and `r = n` (Case 1), there's nothing to close, so the answer is 0.  If only tabs to the left of `l` need closing (Case 2, `l > 1`, `r = n`), it's about getting the cursor to `l` and then using the \"close left\" action.\n\nNow, consider moving the cursor.  If the cursor is to the right of `l` (`pos >= l`), I can simply move left to `l` (taking `pos - l` seconds) and close to the left (1 second).  If the cursor is already at or to the right of `l`, then closing to the left is simply `pos - l + 1` seconds.  What happens if the cursor *is to the left of l*?  This initially seemed impossible, as I'm thinking about it, if `pos < l`, it means that `pos` itself must be between `1` and `l - 1`, right? So it must be closed. This would contradict `pos` is the current cursor, and the problem explicitly defines `a` and `b` are bounds on *unclosed* tabs.  Ah, I understand. The crucial part I've missed - `a` and `b` define the current unclosed tabs, *globally*. If `pos < l`, then any tab *between* `pos` and `l` is considered closed.\n\nOkay, I need to focus on this, `a` and `b` define the bounds of the currently unclosed tabs.  This clarifies how to calculate the minimum seconds. It is a bit more nuanced.\n\nThis suggests a strategic approach is needed, maybe some kind of iterative process where I analyze each step of closing tabs. I'll need to define functions or variables to represent the state of the tabs (closed/open), and update `a` and `b` accordingly. That's a good starting point for the Python script.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`). Each action (moving cursor, closing a segment) takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n1.  **No tabs need to be closed:**\n    This happens if `l = 1` and `r = n`. In this case, all tabs are already within the desired range.\n    Time: `0` seconds.\n\n2.  **Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r = n`):**\n    We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `l`.\n    -   Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    -   Close tabs `[1, l-1]` (to the left of `l`): `1` second.\n    Total time: `abs(pos - l) + 1` seconds.\n\n3.  **Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed (`l = 1` and `r < n`):**\n    We need to close tabs `[r+1, n]`. To do this, the cursor must be at tab `r`.\n    -   Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    -   Close tabs `[r+1, n]` (to the right of `r`): `1` second.\n    Total time: `abs(pos - r) + 1` seconds.\n\n4.  **Tabs on both sides need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r < n`):**\n    We need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This requires two \"close\" operations.\n    The cursor must visit `l` (to close left) and `r` (to close right). The order doesn't matter for the final state, but it affects the path.\n\n    Let's consider two main strategies:\n\n    *   **Strategy A: Close left first, then close right.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]` (to the left of `l`): `1` second.\n            At this point, `a` becomes `l`. The cursor is at `l`.\n        3.  Move cursor from `l` to `r`: `r - l` seconds.\n        4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]` (to the right of `r`): `1` second.\n            At this point, `b` becomes `r`.\n        Total time: `abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1` seconds.\n\n    *   **Strategy B: Close right first, then close left.**\n        1.  Move cursor from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n        2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]` (to the right of `r`): `1` second.\n            At this point, `b` becomes `r`. The cursor is at `r`.\n        3.  Move cursor from `r` to `l`: `r - l` seconds.\n        4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]` (to the left of `l`): `1` second.\n            At this point, `a` becomes `l`.\n        Total time: `abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1` seconds.\n\n    The minimum time for this case is `min(Strategy A, Strategy B)`.\n    Notice that `(r - l) + 1 + 1` is common to both strategies. The difference is `abs(pos - l)` vs `abs(pos - r)`.\n    So, the time is `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2` seconds.\n\nCombining these observations:\n\n*   If `l == 1` and `r == n`: `0`\n*   Else if `l == 1`: `abs(pos - r) + 1`\n*   Else if `r == n`: `abs(pos - l) + 1`\n*   Else (`l > 1` and `r < n`): `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2`\n\nLet's test with the examples:\n\n1.  `n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4`\n    `l > 1` and `r < n`. This is the last case.\n    `min(abs(3 - 2), abs(3 - 4)) + (4 - 2) + 2`\n    `min(1, 1) + 2 + 2`\n    `1 + 2 + 2 = 5`. Correct.\n\n2.  `n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3`\n    `l = 1` and `r < n`. This is the second case.\n    `abs(pos - r) + 1`\n    `abs(3 - 3) + 1`\n    `0 + 1 = 1`. Correct.\n\n3.  `n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5`\n    `l = 1` and `r = n`. This is the first case.\n    `0`. Correct.\n\nThe logic seems sound.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Case 1: No tabs need to be closed\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n    # Case 2: Only tabs to the left of 'l' need to be closed\n    elif l == 1:\n        # Move cursor to 'r', then close right\n        # Total time = (steps to r) + (1 for close operation)\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    # Case 3: Only tabs to the right of 'r' need to be closed\n    elif r == n:\n        # Move cursor to 'l', then close left\n        # Total time = (steps to l) + (1 for close operation)\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    # Case 4: Tabs on both sides need to be closed\n    else:\n        # We need to close tabs to the left of 'l' AND to the right of 'r'.\n        # This requires two close operations (+2 seconds).\n        # We also need to move the cursor from 'pos' to either 'l' or 'r',\n        # then move from that endpoint to the other endpoint.\n        #\n        # Option A: Go to 'l', close left, then go to 'r', close right.\n        # Time = abs(pos - l) + 1 (to l and close left)\n        #        + (r - l) + 1 (to r and close right)\n        #\n        # Option B: Go to 'r', close right, then go to 'l', close left.\n        # Time = abs(pos - r) + 1 (to r and close right)\n        #        + (r - l) + 1 (to l and close left)\n        #\n        # We take the minimum of these two options.\n        # This simplifies to: min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n        \n        time_to_l_then_r = abs(pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n        time_to_r_then_l = abs(pos - r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1\n        \n        print(min(time_to_l_then_r, time_to_r_then_l))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
