Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The \"Guard Duty (easy)\" Challenge: A Path to Non-Intersecting Assignments**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem, \"Guard Duty (easy)\", and it's got me thinking. The goal is to write a Python script to determine if we can perfectly match Rebel spaceships to bases such that the line segments connecting them *don't* intersect.\n\nFirst things first: the problem statement.  We've got `R` rebels and `B` bases.  The constraints are clear: `R` must equal `B` for any solution to exist. That's the baseline. If they aren't equal, immediate \"No\". Easy enough.\n\nNow, the core of the problem: non-intersecting segments. This is where things get interesting.  I'm used to these geometry problems.  When you want non-intersecting connections between two sets of points, it usually boils down to something about planarity or the order of points.  The classic approach I'd reach for is sorting - sorting the points by x-coordinate, or maybe some other metric, and seeing if that allows for a simple mapping. But this one's tricky.\n\nThe \"no three points collinear\" guarantee is a good one, it makes calculations easier. And I remember the cross product as the workhorse here to determine the orientation of a triplet of points.  We can use cross product calculations to determine if two line segments intersect. That's the key: check every possible matching configuration to check for intersection.\n\nTo check for intersections between segments `(p1, p2)` and `(p3, p4)` using the orientation, we calculate if `p1` and `p2` are on opposite sides of `p3p4` *and* `p3` and `p4` are on opposite sides of `p1p2`. If both are true, they intersect.\n\nI'm thinking I'll need a function for the cross product to get the orientation (clockwise, counter-clockwise, or collinear).  Then I can build a nested loop, considering all permutations of the rebels and bases, and systematically check for intersections using this orientation check. If any intersections are found, it's a \"No.\" If I exhaust all permutations without any intersections, then it's a \"Yes.\"  The constraint on the number of spaceships and bases is small enough that a brute-force approach, with this intersection check, should be feasible.  Let's code it!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if it's possible to assign `R` Rebel spaceships to `B` bases such that each spaceship guards exactly one base, each base is guarded by exactly one spaceship, and no two paths (straight line segments) from a base to its assigned spaceship intersect.\n\nFirst, for a perfect matching to exist, the number of Rebel spaceships `R` must be equal to the number of bases `B`. If `R != B`, it's impossible, so we output \"No\".\n\nIf `R == B`, we need to find if there's *any* permutation of assignments that satisfies the non-intersection constraint. Since `R` and `B` are very small (up to 10), we can try all possible permutations of assignments.\n\nLet the Rebel spaceships be `Rebels = [R_0, R_1, ..., R_{R-1}]` and bases be `Bases = [B_0, B_1, ..., B_{B-1}]`.\nWe need to find a permutation `P` of `[0, 1, ..., B-1]` such that if we connect `R_i` to `B_{P[i]}` for all `i`, no two segments intersect.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read `R` and `B`.\n2.  Read coordinates for `R` Rebel spaceships and `B` bases. Store them as lists of tuples or lists of lists.\n3.  If `R != B`, print \"No\" and exit.\n4.  If `R == B`:\n    a.  Iterate through all permutations of indices `[0, 1, ..., B-1]`. Each permutation `P` represents a potential assignment: `R_i` is assigned to `B_{P[i]}`.\n    b.  For each permutation:\n        i.   Construct the list of `B` segments: `segments = [(Rebels[i], Bases[P[i]]) for i in range(B)]`.\n        ii.  Check if any two segments in `segments` intersect.\n            *   To do this, iterate through all unique pairs of segments `(s_j, s_k)` where `j < k`.\n            *   Use a geometric function `segments_intersect(s1, s2)` to check for intersection.\n        iii. If *no* pair of segments intersects, then we have found a valid assignment. Print \"Yes\" and exit.\n5.  If after checking all permutations, no valid assignment is found, print \"No\".\n\n**Geometric Intersection Check (`segments_intersect`):**\nTwo line segments `(p1, p2)` and `(p3, p4)` intersect if and only if:\n1.  `p1` and `p2` lie on opposite sides of the line containing `p3p4`.\n2.  `p3` and `p4` lie on opposite sides of the line containing `p1p2`.\n\nThis can be determined using the cross product (or orientation test). The orientation of an ordered triplet of points `(p, q, r)` tells us if `r` is to the left (counter-clockwise), right (clockwise), or collinear with the directed line `pq`.\nThe function `orientation(p, q, r)` returns:\n*   `> 0` if `p, q, r` are counter-clockwise.\n*   `< 0` if `p, q, r` are clockwise.\n*   `= 0` if `p, q, r` are collinear.\nThis value is calculated as `(q_x - p_x) * (r_y - p_y) - (q_y - p_y) * (r_x - p_x)`.\n\nSegments `(p1, p2)` and `(p3, p4)` intersect if:\n`o1 = orientation(p1, p2, p3)`\n`o2 = orientation(p1, p2, p4)`\n`o3 = orientation(p3, p4, p1)`\n`o4 = orientation(p3, p4, p2)`\n\nThey intersect if `o1 * o2 < 0` AND `o3 * o4 < 0`.\nThe problem statement guarantees \"no three points are on the same line\", which simplifies things as we don't need to handle collinear cases (where `orientation` returns 0) for segment-endpoint checks. This means we don't need to consider \"on-segment\" checks.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\nR=3, B=3\nRebels: `[(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]`\nBases: `[(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]`\n\nLet's try the identity permutation `P = [0, 1, 2]`:\nAssignments: `(R_0, B_0)`, `(R_1, B_1)`, `(R_2, B_2)`\nSegments:\n`s_0 = ((0,0), (-2,1))`\n`s_1 = ((2,0), (0,3))`\n`s_2 = ((3,1), (2,2))`\n\nCheck `s_0` and `s_1`:\n`p1=(0,0), p2=(-2,1)`\n`p3=(2,0), p4=(0,3)`\n`o(p1,p2,p3) = orientation((0,0),(-2,1),(2,0)) = ((-2)-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) = -2` (clockwise)\n`o(p1,p2,p4) = orientation((0,0),(-2,1),(0,3)) = ((-2)-0)*(3-0) - (1-0)*(0-0) = -6` (clockwise)\nSince `o(p1,p2,p3)` and `o(p1,p2,p4)` have the same sign, `p3` and `p4` are on the same side of line `p1p2`. No intersection.\n\nCheck `s_0` and `s_2`:\n`p1=(0,0), p2=(-2,1)`\n`p3=(3,1), p4=(2,2)`\n`o(p1,p2,p3) = orientation((0,0),(-2,1),(3,1)) = ((-2)-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(3-0) = -2 - 3 = -5` (clockwise)\n`o(p1,p2,p4) = orientation((0,0),(-2,1),(2,2)) = ((-2)-0)*(2-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) = -4 - 2 = -6` (clockwise)\nSame sign. No intersection.\n\nCheck `s_1` and `s_2`:\n`p1=(2,0), p2=(0,3)`\n`p3=(3,1), p4=(2,2)`\n`o(p1,p2,p3) = orientation((2,0),(0,3),(3,1)) = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-2) = -2*1 - 3*1 = -5` (clockwise)\n`o(p1,p2,p4) = orientation((2,0),(0,3),(2,2)) = (0-2)*(2-0) - (3-0)*(2-2) = -2*2 - 3*0 = -4` (clockwise)\nSame sign. No intersection.\n\nSince no segments intersect for `P = [0, 1, 2]`, the output is \"Yes\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Helper function to calculate orientation of an ordered triplet (p, q, r)\n# Returns a value > 0 if p, q, r are counter-clockwise\n# Returns a value < 0 if p, q, r are clockwise\n# Returns 0 if p, q, r are collinear (not strictly needed due to problem constraints)\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - \\\n          (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    return val\n\n# Function to check if two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect\n# This simplified version relies on the problem guarantee that no three points are collinear.\n# Thus, orientation will never be 0 for distinct points and segment endpoints.\ndef segments_intersect(s1_p1, s1_p2, s2_p1, s2_p2):\n    # Find the four orientations needed for general case\n    o1 = orientation(s1_p1, s1_p2, s2_p1)\n    o2 = orientation(s1_p1, s1_p2, s2_p2)\n    o3 = orientation(s2_p1, s2_p2, s1_p1)\n    o4 = orientation(s2_p1, s2_p2, s1_p2)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect if orientations are different for both lines\n    if o1 != 0 and o2 != 0 and o3 != 0 and o4 != 0: # Ensure no collinearity (guaranteed by problem for distinct points)\n        if (o1 > 0) != (o2 > 0) and (o3 > 0) != (o4 > 0):\n            return True\n    \n    return False\n\ndef solve():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        rebels.append(list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        bases.append(list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())))\n\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    # Iterate through all permutations of base assignments\n    # Each permutation `p` maps rebel `i` to base `p[i]`\n    for p_indices in permutations(range(B)):\n        current_segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            current_segments.append((rebels[i], bases[p_indices[i]]))\n\n        # Check for intersections among current_segments\n        has_intersection = False\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                s1_p1, s1_p2 = current_segments[i]\n                s2_p1, s2_p2 = current_segments[j]\n                \n                # Check if segments share an endpoint (they shouldn't intersect in this case)\n                # The problem states \"no two points coincide\", so endpoints are distinct.\n                # If they share an endpoint, they don't \"intersect\" in the sense of crossing.\n                if (s1_p1 == s2_p1 or s1_p1 == s2_p2 or \n                    s1_p2 == s2_p1 or s1_p2 == s2_p2):\n                    continue \n\n                if segments_intersect(s1_p1, s1_p2, s2_p1, s2_p2):\n                    has_intersection = True\n                    break\n            if has_intersection:\n                break\n        \n        if not has_intersection:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
