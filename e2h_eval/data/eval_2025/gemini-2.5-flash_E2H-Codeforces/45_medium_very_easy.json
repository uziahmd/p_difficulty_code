There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tennis Championship Problem and Fibonacci Numbers**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with figuring out a Python script to solve this \"Tennis Championship\" problem. The core of it revolves around a knockout tournament where players are eliminated after a loss, but with a crucial rule: players can only compete against each other if the difference in the number of games they've played is at most one. The goal is to maximize the number of games the tournament winner can play, given a fixed number of initial players (`n`).\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze this rule, the absolute value between the number of game counts between two players cannot exceed 1. This means, if a player `A` has won all `kA` games, and `B` has won `kB` games, they can play if `|kA - kB| <= 1`. The winner wants the most amount of games played. This rule is key to optimizing the winner's path.\n\nSo, let's track the number of players available at each \"level\" of games played. Initially, we start with all `n` players at level 0 (zero games played). The key is this: to maximize the winner's games, we should try to reuse the players, not have many different players with 0 games. Now I am starting to think of a dynamic approach. I can consider the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nI need to find the maximum `k` for a winner with `n` players. So it looks like the minimum player amount increases with the next games played. This means I want to know, given `n` players, what's the maximum number of games the winner can possibly play? It's like finding the highest index of the minimum player amount, that does not exceed `n`.\n\nNow I realize the solution is linked to the Fibonacci sequence. If we let `fib(k)` be the minimum number of players needed for a winner with `k` games, then `fib(k) = fib(k-1) + fib(k-2)` with base cases `fib(0) = 1` (a player who has no game) and `fib(1) = 2` (a player has 1 game). It's essentially the number of players that enables the winner to play `k` games and win all, eliminating everyone else. I am not even sure about using `k` games for the winner. Let's start with tracking the number of players to let the player achieve `k` wins, after eliminating the rest.\n\nI started listing out values and noticing this is a recurrence relation. The key rule, limits who the winner plays. A player at `k` games needs someone at `k-1` or `k-2` games. This means to maximize `k`, the goal is to make use of existing players as much as possible. I want to reuse players whenever possible. To maximize the game count, the strategy is to pair players who have played nearly the same number of games to efficiently progress towards the winner.\n\nSo, I am looking for the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`. It looks like I need to implement a Fibonacci sequence generator and then perform a binary search to figure out what is the maximum number of games I can set with `n` players. I will need to iterate to figure this out and confirm that `n` is greater or equal than the `fib` value, and this is the maximum possible.\n\nTherefore, the main idea boils down to calculating Fibonacci numbers and stopping once we exceed `n`. The value before the one that exceeds `n` is the answer. I will start by initializing variables and a loop, where I check if the Fibonacci numbers are still less than the provided `n` value. The Fibonacci number has to be the players, if `n` allows. The code will return the maximum games that the winner can obtain in this tournament.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` players and a specific rule for pairing players. The rule is: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games.\n\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of initial players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `k` games, with all other players eliminated. We want to find the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's determine the recurrence for `f(k)`:\n\n*   **Base Case `k=0`**: A player who has played 0 games. This requires 1 player. So, `f(0) = 1`.\n*   **Base Case `k=1`**: A player plays 1 game. This winner (who had 0 games) must beat an opponent (who also had 0 games). This requires 2 players in total. So, `f(1) = 2`.\n\nNow, consider a winner who has played `k` games (`k >= 2`). This player (let's call them W) must have won their `k`-th game. Before this game, W had `k-1` wins. Their opponent (let's call them O) must satisfy the rule `| (k-1) - (games_O) | <= 1`. This means O must have `k-1` or `k-2` wins.\n\nTo minimize the total number of players `f(k)`, we should choose the opponent `O` such that the sub-tournament to produce `O` requires the fewest players.\n1.  **Option 1: Opponent `O` has `k-1` wins.**\n    This requires one winner with `k-1` games (W) and another winner with `k-1` games (O). Assuming these two sub-tournaments are independent, the total players needed would be `f(k-1) + f(k-1) = 2 * f(k-1)`.\n2.  **Option 2: Opponent `O` has `k-2` wins.**\n    This requires one winner with `k-1` games (W) and one winner with `k-2` games (O). Assuming these two sub-tournaments are independent, the total players needed would be `f(k-1) + f(k-2)`.\n\nWe want to minimize `f(k)`, so we choose the option that requires fewer players.\nLet's check the values:\n`f(0) = 1`\n`f(1) = 2`\n`f(2)`:\n    Option 1 (W(1) vs O(1)): `2 * f(1) = 2 * 2 = 4` players.\n    Option 2 (W(1) vs O(0)): `f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3` players.\n    Clearly, 3 players is less than 4 players. So, `f(2) = 3`.\n    An example for `n=3`: Player 1 beats Player 2 (P1 has 1 game). Player 3 has 0 games. P1 plays P3 (P1 has 1 game, P3 has 0 games; `|1-0|=1`, valid). P1 wins, now has 2 games.\n\n`f(3)`:\n    Option 1 (W(2) vs O(2)): `2 * f(2) = 2 * 3 = 6` players.\n    Option 2 (W(2) vs O(1)): `f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5` players.\n    Clearly, 5 players is less than 6 players. So, `f(3) = 5`.\n    An example for `n=5`:\n    P1 wins 2 games (needs 3 players: P1, P2, P3).\n    P4 wins 1 game (needs 2 players: P4, P5).\n    P1 (2 games) plays P4 (1 game). `|2-1|=1`, valid. P1 wins, now has 3 games.\n\nIn general, for `k >= 2`, `f(k-2)` will always be less than `f(k-1)` (since the sequence `f(k)` is strictly increasing for `k >= 0`). Therefore, `f(k-1) + f(k-2)` will always be less than `2 * f(k-1)`.\nSo, the recurrence relation is `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)` for `k >= 2`, with base cases `f(0)=1` and `f(1)=2`.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence, shifted. If `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, ...`, then `f(k) = F_{k+2}`.\n\nWe need to find the largest `k` such that `f(k) <= n`. We can do this by generating Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`.\n\nLet's track `f_prev` (for `k-1` games) and `f_curr` (for `k` games) along with the corresponding `games_played`.\n\nInitial values:\n`f_prev = 1` (corresponds to `f(0)`)\n`f_curr = 2` (corresponds to `f(1)`)\n`games_played = 1` (since `n >= 2`, at least 1 game can be played)\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.  Read `n`.\n2.  Initialize `f_prev = 1`, `f_curr = 2`, `games_played = 1`.\n3.  If `n == 1`, the answer is 0. (Problem statement says `n >= 2`, so this case is not strictly necessary but good to consider for completeness).\n4.  Loop while `f_curr <= n`:\n    a.  Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `f_next = f_prev + f_curr`.\n    b.  Update `f_prev = f_curr`.\n    c.  Update `f_curr = f_next`.\n    d.  Increment `games_played` by 1.\n5.  After the loop, `f_curr` has become greater than `n`. This means the previous `games_played` value (before the last increment) was the maximum possible. So, the result is `games_played - 1`.\n\nLet's trace with the example `n=4`:\n*   Initial: `f_prev = 1`, `f_curr = 2`, `games_played = 1`.\n*   Loop 1: `f_curr <= n` (2 <= 4) is True.\n    *   `f_next = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n    *   `f_prev = 2`.\n    *   `f_curr = 3`.\n    *   `games_played = 2`.\n*   Loop 2: `f_curr <= n` (3 <= 4) is True.\n    *   `f_next = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n    *   `f_prev = 3`.\n    *   `f_curr = 5`.\n    *   `games_played = 3`.\n*   Loop 3: `f_curr <= n` (5 <= 4) is False.\n*   Return `games_played - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`. This matches the example output for `n=4`.\n\nThe maximum value of `n` is `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so `k` will be relatively small (around 85-90). A simple loop is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Base cases for f(k):\n    # f(0) = 1 (1 player needed for 0 games)\n    # f(1) = 2 (2 players needed for 1 game)\n\n    # Initialize variables:\n    # f_prev represents f(current_games - 1)\n    # f_curr represents f(current_games)\n    # games_played represents current_games\n    \n    # If n is 1, 0 games played.
