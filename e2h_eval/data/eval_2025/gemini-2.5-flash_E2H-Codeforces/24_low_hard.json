She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Browser Tab Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Browser\" problem. It's about minimizing the time to close tabs, given a browser with `n` tabs, an initial cursor position (`pos`), and a segment `[l, r]` that needs to *remain* open. The goal is to close everything outside this segment.\n\nMy first thought is to understand the core elements: The problem's essentially about navigating and closing. There are four operations: moving the cursor left or right, and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor. Each operation takes one second.\n\nThe most important insight is to think about the *state* of the browser. It's not just the cursor position; it's also about which tabs are still open.  The variables `a` and `b` represent the boundaries of *unclosed* tabs, and those *change* as tabs get closed. Initially, it's all tabs.\n\nNow, I'm breaking down the possible scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Everything's good.** If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, it means the target segment *is* the entire browser, so I need to do absolutely nothing. Time is 0. Easy!\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Only left-side tabs need closing.** When `l` is greater than 1, and `r` is `n`, I focus on closing tabs to the left. The cursor needs to be at `l` for a \"close left\" operation. I need to calculate the distance the cursor needs to move to get there. If the initial position is already on or to the right of `l` I calculate `pos - l`. If `pos < l` I need to move to the left by `l - pos`. In either case, it's an absolute value of the difference. Then there's the one second for the closing operation, giving `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n*   **Scenario 3: Only right-side tabs need closing.** With `l` equal to 1, and `r` less than `n`, I have to focus on closing tabs to the right. The cursor moves to `r` and uses \"close right.\"  The calculation mirrors Scenario 2, just flipped. I either move right or wait.\n",
