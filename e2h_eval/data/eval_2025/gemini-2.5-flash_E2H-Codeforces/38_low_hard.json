    "thought": "**My Approach to the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out two things for a given integer `p`. First, what's the smallest number of nodes (`N`) you need to build a directed graph that satisfies a certain property? And second, given that minimum `N`, what's the maximum number of unidirectional pairs you can possibly have in such a graph?\n\nLet's break down the definitions. A unidirectional pair, `(u, v)`, means there's a directed path from `u` to `v`, but crucially, no path back from `v` to `u`. The real constraint is that the graph is \"p-reachable\". This means there are exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u` is less than `v` (based on node labels) and where `u` and `v` can reach each other.\n\nThe trick here is realizing that \"mutually reachable\" means those nodes must be within the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC). So, `p` represents the count of pairs `(u,v)` within the same SCC where `u < v`.\n\nNow, how do we minimize `N`? We've got to think about how SCCs contribute to this count `p`. If you have an SCC of size `k`, any two nodes within it can reach each other in either direction. So the number of pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` from that SCC is  `k * (k - 1) / 2`. To minimize the number of nodes, I want to create the largest possible SCCs. I want to try to cram all the `p` pairs into a single SCC first.\n\nSo, the game plan: For the minimum `N`, I'm going to look for the smallest `k` where `k * (k - 1) / 2` is greater than or equal to `p`. That `k` will be the size of our minimum SCC, which is our optimal value of `N` if possible. I'll probably need to iterate, or even solve a quadratic equation, to find the right `k`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two values:\n1. The minimum number of nodes `N` required to create a `p`-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such `p`-reachable directed graphs with `N` nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's analyze the definitions:\n- A graph is `p`-reachable if there are exactly `p` ordered pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and `u` and `v` are reachable from each other. This means `u` and `v` are in the same Strongly Connected Component (SCC).\n- An ordered pair `(u, v)` is unidirectional if `u \\neq v`, there is a path from `u` to `v`, and there are no paths from `v` to `u`.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum number of nodes `N`**\n\nConsider an SCC of size `k`. Any two distinct nodes `u, v` within this SCC are mutually reachable. The number of pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` from this SCC is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\nIf a graph has multiple SCCs, say of sizes `k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m`, the total number of nodes is `N = \\sum k_i`. The total count `p` would be `\\sum (k_i * (k_i - 1) / 2)`.\nTo minimize `N` for a given `p`, we should try to put all `p` pairs into as few nodes as possible. This means making the SCCs as large as possible. The most efficient way to generate `p` pairs is to put all nodes into a single SCC.\nLet `f(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2`. We need to find the smallest `k` such that `f(k) \\ge p`.\nWe can iterate `k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots` and calculate `f(k)` until `f(k) \\ge p`. This `k` will be our minimum `N`.\nFor `p=0`, `f(1)=0`, so `N=1`.\nFor `p=1`, `f(2)=1`, so `N=2`.\nFor `p=2`, `f(3)=3`, so `N=3`.\nFor `p=3`, `f(3)=3`, so `N=3`.\nThis `N` will be the minimum number of nodes.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum number of unidirectional pairs for `N` nodes**\n\nLet `N` be the minimum number of nodes found in Part 1. We need to construct a graph with `N` nodes that is `p`-reachable and maximizes unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet `k_0` be the size of the largest SCC we can form using `N` nodes such that `f(k_0) \\le p`.\nThis `k_0` is the largest `k` such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 \\le p`.\nThe remaining `p - f(k_0)` pairs must be formed by nodes outside this `k_0`-sized SCC, or by adding nodes to it.\nSince we want to use exactly `N` nodes, and `N` is the minimum, it means we found `N` such that `f(N) \\ge p`.\nIf `f(N) = p`, we can form a single SCC of size `N`. In this case, there are no unidirectional pairs, as all pairs are mutually reachable. The number of unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\nIf `f(N) > p`, we must form a graph with `N` nodes such that it has exactly `p` pairs `(u, v)` with `u < v` that are mutually reachable.\nThis means we will have one large SCC of size `k_0` such that `k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2 \\le p`, and `(k_0+1) * k_0 / 2 > p`.\nThe remaining `p - k_0 * (k_0 - 1) / 2` pairs must be formed by adding `N - k_0` nodes, where some of them are connected to the `k_0` SCC, forming a larger SCC of size `k_0 + (p - f(k_0))` effectively.\nHowever, this is not quite right. The minimum `N` is such that `f(N) \\ge p`.\nLet's say `N_{min}` is the minimum number of nodes.\nWe find `N_{min}` such that `N_{min} * (N_{min} - 1) / 2 \\ge p`.\nLet `k_{base} = N_{min} - 1`. Then `k_{base} * (k_{base} - 1) / 2 < p`.\nThis means we need at least `N_{min}` nodes.\nWe can form an SCC of size `N_{min}`. This gives `N_{min} * (N_{min} - 1) / 2` mutually reachable pairs. If this is exactly `p`, then all `N_{min}` nodes are in one SCC, and there are 0 unidirectional pairs.\n\nIf `N_{min} * (N_{min} - 1) / 2 > p`, we must have some nodes not in the main SCC, or some nodes in the main SCC are not mutually reachable with *all* other nodes in that SCC.\nThe problem statement implies that `p` pairs `(u,v)` with `u<v` are mutually reachable. These nodes form an SCC.\nConsider `N` nodes. To maximize unidirectional pairs, we want to maximize paths `u -> v` without `v -> u`. This happens when nodes are in different SCCs, and there are paths between these SCCs.\nA common construction to maximize unidirectional pairs is a \"line\" of SCCs.\nLet's say we have `N` nodes. We can form one large SCC of size `k_{scc}`. This contributes `k_{scc} * (k_{scc} - 1) / 2` to `p`.\nThe remaining `N - k_{scc}` nodes are \"isolated\" or form smaller SCCs.\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, these `N - k_{scc}` nodes should be arranged such that they form paths from one to another, eventually leading into the main SCC, or forming a chain among themselves.\n\nLet `k` be the largest integer such that `k * (k - 1) / 2 \\le p`.\nWe will use `k` nodes to form an SCC. These `k` nodes contribute `k * (k - 1) / 2` pairs to `p`.\nWe have `p_{rem} = p - k * (k - 1) / 2` remaining pairs to account for.\nWe also have `N - k` nodes remaining.\nThe `p_{rem}` pairs must come from nodes outside the `k`-SCC that are mutually reachable with some nodes within or outside the `k`-SCC.\nThe minimum `N` is found by iterating `N_c = 0, 1, \\dots` until `N_c * (N_c - 1) / 2 \\ge p`. This `N_c` is our `N`.\nSo, `(N-1) * (N-2) / 2 < p \\le N * (N-1) / 2`.\nThis means we need `N` nodes.\nLet `k = N-1`. We can form an SCC of size `k` using `k` nodes. This gives `k * (k-1) / 2` pairs.\nWe have `N - k = 1` node remaining. Let this node be `v_N`.\nLet the `k` nodes in the SCC be `v_1, \\ldots, v_k`.\nThe number of `p` pairs we need is `p`. We have `p_{current} = k * (k-1) / 2` pairs.\nThe remaining `p_{rem} = p - p_{current}` pairs must be formed by node `v_N` mutually reachable with `p_{rem}` nodes from `v_1, \\ldots, v_k`.\nThis implies `v_N` forms an SCC of size `p_{rem} + 1` with `p_{rem}` nodes from `v_1, \\ldots, v_k`.\nSo we have an SCC of size `p_{rem} + 1` and `k - p_{rem}` isolated nodes.\nThe total number of nodes is `(p_{rem} + 1) + (k - p_{rem}) = k + 1 = N`. This works.\nIn this construction:\n- We have one SCC of size `k_{scc} = p_{rem} + 1`.\n- We have `N - k_{scc}` isolated nodes.\nThe number of unidirectional pairs:\n- Within the `k_{scc}` SCC, there are 0 unidirectional pairs.\n- From an isolated node to another isolated node: 0 (no paths).\n- From an isolated node to a node in `k_{scc}` SCC: `(N - k_{scc}) * k_{scc}` unidirectional pairs (if we add edges `isolated -> SCC_node`).\n- From a node in `k_{scc}` SCC to an isolated node: 0 (if no edges `SCC_node -> isolated`).\n\nTo maximize unidirectional pairs, we should make a chain of the isolated nodes and connect the last one to the SCC.\nLet the `N-k_{scc}` isolated nodes be `u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_{N-k_{scc}}`.\nWe can add edges `u_1 \\to u_2 \\to \\dots \\to u_{N-k_{scc}}`.\nThen add an edge `u_{N-k_{scc}} \\to v` for any `v` in the `k_{scc}` SCC.\nThis creates unidirectional paths:\n- `u_i \\to u_j` for `i < j`: `(N-k_{scc}) * (N-k_{scc}-1) / 2` pairs.\n- `u_i \\to v` for any `v` in `k_{scc}` SCC: `(N-k_{scc}) * k_{scc}` pairs.\nTotal unidirectional pairs: `(N-k_{scc}) * (N-k_{scc}-1) / 2 + (N-k_{scc}) * k_{scc}`.\nThis can be simplified to `(N-k_{scc}) * (N-k_{scc}-1 + 2*k_{scc}) / 2 = (N-k_{scc}) * (N+k_{scc}-1) / 2`.\nLet `N_iso = N - k_{scc}`. The formula is `N_iso * (N_iso - 1) / 2 + N_iso * k_{scc}`.\nThis is the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet's re-calculate `N` and `k_{scc}`:\n1. Find `N`: Iterate `N_val = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots` until `N_val * (N_val - 1) / 2 \\ge p`. This `N_val` is the minimum `N`.\n2. Find `k_{scc}`: Let `k_{base} = N - 1`. The number of pairs from an SCC of size `k_{base}` is `p_{base} = k_{base} * (k_{base} - 1) / 2`.\n   The remaining pairs needed are `p_{rem} = p - p_{base}`.\n   These `p_{rem}` pairs must be formed by connecting the `N`-th node (the one not in the `k_{base}` SCC) to `p_{rem}` nodes within the `k_{base}` SCC.\n   So, the actual SCC will have size `k_{scc} = p_{rem} + 1`.\n   The number of isolated nodes will be `N_{iso} = N - k_{scc}`.\n   The maximum unidirectional pairs will be `N_{iso} * (N_{iso} - 1) / 2 + N_{iso} * k_{scc}`.\n\nExample 1: `p = 3`\n1. `N`:\n   `0 * (-1) / 2 = 0`\n   `1 * 0 / 2 = 0`\n   `2 * 1 / 2 = 1`\n   `3 * 2 / 2 = 3`. So, `N = 3`.\n2. `k_{base} = N - 1 = 2`.\n   `p_{base} = 2 * (2 - 1) / 2 = 1`.\n   `p_{rem} = p - p_{base} = 3 - 1 = 2`.\n   `k_{scc} = p_{rem} + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n   `N_{iso} = N - k_{scc} = 3 - 3 = 0`.\n   Max unidirectional pairs = `0 * (-1) / 2 + 0 * 3 = 0`.\nOutput: `3 0`. Matches example.\n\nExample 2: `p = 4`\n1. `N`:\n   `3 * 2 / 2 = 3`\n   `4 * 3 / 2 = 6`. So, `N = 4`.\n2. `k_{base} = N - 1 = 3`.\n   `p_{base} = 3 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 3`.\n   `p_{rem} = p - p_{base} = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n   `k_{scc} = p_{rem} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n   `N_{iso} = N - k_{scc} = 4 - 2 = 2`.\n   Max unidirectional pairs = `N_{iso} * (N_{iso} - 1) / 2 + N_{iso} * k_{scc}`\n     `= 2 * (2 - 1) / 2 + 2 * 2 = 1 + 4 = 5`.\nOutput: `4 5`. Matches example.\n\nExample 3: `p = 0`\n1. `N`:\n   `0 * (-1) / 2 = 0`\n   `1 * 0 / 2 = 0`. So, `N = 1`.\n2. `k_{base} = N - 1 = 0`.\n   `p_{base} = 0 * (-1) / 2 = 0`.\n   `p_{rem} = p - p_{base} = 0 - 0 = 0`.\n   `k_{scc} = p_{rem} + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n   `N_{iso} = N - k_{scc} = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n   Max unidirectional pairs = `0 * (-1) / 2 + 0 * 1 = 0`.\nOutput: `1 0`. (Example output is `0 0`, which is incorrect for `N`. `N` must be at least 1 for any graph. If `p=0`, a single node graph has 0 pairs `(u,v)` with `u<v` and `u,v` mutually reachable. So N=1 is the minimum. If the problem implies N=0 is possible, then 0 0 would be correct.)\nGiven the problem constraints `p >= 0`, `N` must be at least 1. For `p=0`, `N=1` is the correct minimum.\n\nLet's re-check the `N` for `p=0` case. If `N=0`, there are no nodes, so no pairs. `p=0` is satisfied.\nIf `N=1`, there is one node, no pairs `u<v`. `p=0` is satisfied.\nThe problem statement usually implies `N>=1` for a graph. If `N=0` is allowed, then `0 0` is the answer for `p=0`. If `N>=1` is implied, then `1 0` is the answer.\nCompetitive programming problems usually define a graph as having `N` nodes, `N >= 1`. Let's assume `N >= 1`.\nThe example output for `p=0` is `0 0`. This suggests that `N=0` is a valid graph for `p=0`.\nIf `N=0` is allowed, then for `p=0`, `N=0` is the minimum. Unidirectional pairs is 0. So `0 0`.\nFor `p > 0`, `N` must be at least 2. Our logic for `N` works fine for `p > 0`.\nLet's adjust the `N` calculation for `p=0`.\n\nRevised `N` calculation:\nIf `p == 0`, `N = 0`. (This assumes a graph with 0 nodes is valid and has 0 pairs.)\nIf `p > 0`: Iterate `N_val = 1, 2, \\ldots` until `N_val * (N_val - 1) / 2 \\ge p`. This `N_val` is `N`.\n\nLet's re-run for `p=0` with `N=0`:\n`N = 0`. `k_{base}` is not well-defined. `p_{base}` is not well-defined.\nIf `N=0`, then `k_{scc}=0`, `N_{iso}=0`, unidirectional pairs = 0. So `0 0`. This matches the example.\n\nFinal check on the formula for unidirectional pairs:\n`N_{iso} * (N_{iso} - 1) / 2` is the number of unidirectional pairs among the isolated nodes themselves, if they form a chain.\n`N_{iso} * k_{scc}` is the number of unidirectional pairs from isolated nodes to SCC nodes.\nThis assumes we connect `u_1 \\to u_2 \\to \\dots \\to u_{N_{iso}} \\to v_{scc}`.\nThis construction maximizes unidirectional pairs for given `N_{iso}` and `k_{scc}`.\n\nConsider `p = 2 * 10^5`.\n`N * (N - 1) / 2 >= 2 * 10^5`\n`N^2 - N - 4 * 10^5 >= 0`\n`N^2` is approx `4 * 10^5`\n`N` is approx `sqrt(4 * 10^5) = sqrt(40 * 10^4) = 2 * 10^2 * sqrt(10) approx 200 * 3.16 = 632`.\nLet's test `N = 632`: `632 * 631 / 2 = 199396`.\nLet's test `N = 633`: `633 * 632 / 2 = 200000 - 633/2 = 200000 + 316.5 = 200016`.\nSo, for `p = 2 * 10^5`, `N = 633`.\n\n`k_{base} = N - 1 = 632`.\n`p_{base} = 632 * 631 / 2 = 199396`.\n`p_{rem} = p - p_{base} = 200000 - 199396 = 604`.\n`k_{scc} = p_{rem} + 1 = 604 + 1 = 605`.\n`N_{iso} = N - k_{scc} = 633 - 605 = 28`.\nMax unidirectional pairs = `N_{iso} * (N_{iso} - 1) / 2 + N_{iso} * k_{scc}`\n  `= 28 * 27 / 2 + 28 * 605`\n  `= 14 * 27 + 28 * 605`\n  `= 378 + 16940 = 17318`.\nThis confirms the numbers are within integer limits.\n\nThe loop for `N`:\n`N_val = 0`\n`current_p_count = 0`\n`while current_p_count < p:`\n  `N_val += 1`\n  `current_p_count = N_val * (N_val - 1) // 2`\nIf `p=0`, the loop condition `0 < 0` is false, so `N_val` remains 0.
