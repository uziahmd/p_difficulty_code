            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Finalized Thoughts and Strategy for \"Guard Duty (easy)\"**\n\nAlright, let's get this done. The \"Guard Duty\" problem is, at its core, a geometric constraint satisfaction problem. We're given rebel spaceships and bases, and we need to assign each rebel to a base, forming non-intersecting paths between them.  The key to this problem is the geometric test: checking if line segments intersect.\n\nFirst things first, if the number of rebels (`R`) doesn't equal the number of bases (`B`), we immediately output \"No\" because a perfect matching is impossible.  Now, assuming `R` equals `B`, we move into the main algorithm.\n\nThe core idea revolves around permutations. Since the number of rebels and bases is small (up to 10), we can exhaustively check every possible assignment of rebels to bases. Each assignment creates a set of line segments (paths). We need to determine if any pair of these segments intersects.\n\nThe intersection check itself is where the geometric insight comes into play. Since we're told that no three points are collinear and no two points coincide, we can use a simplified, efficient cross-product approach.  Two segments, `AB` and `CD`, intersect *if and only if* `A` and `B` are on opposite sides of line `CD`, *and* `C` and `D` are on opposite sides of line `AB`.  We can determine \"opposite sides\" using the 2D cross product. The sign of the cross product indicates which side of a line a point lies on. This provides a very clean intersection test.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n1.  **Check Equality:**  Ensure `R == B`.\n2.  **Read Input:**  Get the coordinates of all rebels and bases.\n3.  **Permutations:**  Generate all permutations of bases (or rebels, doesn't matter).\n4.  **Intersection Check (Inner Loop):** For each permutation (assignment), iterate through all pairs of line segments and call the `segments_intersect` function. The key is in `segments_intersect`: `cross_product(R_k B_l, R_i) * cross_product(R_k B_l, B_j) < 0` and `cross_product(R_i B_j, R_k) * cross_product(R_i B_j, B_l) < 0`  both have to be true.  If an intersection is detected, mark the permutation as invalid and move to the next.\n5.  **Output:** If a permutation is found with no intersecting segments, print \"Yes\" and stop.  Otherwise, if all permutations have intersections, print \"No\".\n\nThe `cross_product` helper is straightforward:  `cross_product(p1, p2, p3) = (p2.x - p1.x) * (p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y) * (p3.x - p1.x)`.\n\nThat covers everything, let's code it up!\n",
