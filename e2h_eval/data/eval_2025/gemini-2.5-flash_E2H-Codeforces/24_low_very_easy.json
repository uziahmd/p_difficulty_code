She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Browser Problem: A Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Browser\" problem in competitive programming, and my goal is to figure out the optimal Python script. First, I need to understand the core elements: `n` tabs total, an initial cursor position `pos`, and a range `[l, r]` that *must* remain open. Everything else has to go.\n\nThe allowable operations are moving the cursor left or right, or closing tabs to the left or right. Each takes a second. The objective is to minimize the total time.\n\nThe key to this problem seems to be getting the cursor in the right position to perform the \"close\" operations efficiently. I need to close tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means closing `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`.\n\nI'm thinking, in the simplest scenario where `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, no action is needed, resulting in a time of 0. That's my base case.\n\nIf I *do* need to close tabs, my approach will be to consider the two segments separately.\n\nFor closing `[1, l-1]`, I'll need to move the cursor to tab `l` (or any tab greater than `l`) and then perform a \"close left\" operation. Similarly, to close `[r+1, n]`, I'll need to get the cursor to tab `r` (or any tab less than `r`) and then execute a \"close right\" operation. I can envision the scenario where `a` would be 1 and `b` would be `n`, which help to simplify the understanding and logic behind closing the tabs.\n\nThe critical insight here is I need at most *two* close operations: one for the left segment and one for the right.\n\nNow, I'm considering different cases:\n\n*   **If `l == 1`:** I only need to close tabs to the right of `r`. The cost will be the distance `|pos - r|` to move the cursor to `r` plus one second to close.\n*   **If `r == n`:** I only need to close tabs to the left of `l`. Similar to the previous case, it's `|pos - l| + 1`.\n\nThe goal now is to efficiently combine these observations into a Python script. I will determine how I'll create this logic, but I believe I can leverage these key insights to solve this problem efficiently.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means we need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` (if `l > 1`) and tabs `[r+1, n]` (if `r < n`). Each operation (moving cursor or closing a segment) takes 1 second.\n\nLet's analyze the operations and target state:\n1.  **Move cursor:** `abs(current_pos - target_pos)` seconds.\n2.  **Close tabs to the left of cursor:** If the cursor is at tab `i`, it closes tabs `[a, i-1]`. To close `[1, l-1]`, the cursor must be at tab `l` (or any tab to its right) and perform this operation. The minimum index `a` will be `1` until these tabs are closed.\n3.  **Close tabs to the right of cursor:** If the cursor is at tab `i`, it closes tabs `[i+1, b]`. To close `[r+1, n]`, the cursor must be at tab `r` (or any tab to its left) and perform this operation. The maximum index `b` will be `n` until these tabs are closed.\n\nWe need to perform at most two \"close\" operations: one for the left segment (`[1, l-1]`) and one for the right segment (`[r+1, n]`).\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1: No tabs need to be closed.**\nThis happens if `l = 1` and `r = n`. All tabs are already within the desired range.\nTime = 0.\n\n**Scenario 2: Only tabs to the right of `r` need to be closed (i.e., `l = 1`).**\nWe need to close `[r+1, n]`.\nThe cursor must move to `r` and then perform a \"close right\" operation.\n- Time to move from `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)`\n- Time to close tabs to the right of `r`: `1`\nTotal time = `abs(pos - r) + 1`.\n\n**Scenario 3: Only tabs to the left of `l` need to be closed (i.e., `r = n`).**\nWe need to close `[1, l-1]`.\nThe cursor must move to `l` and then perform a \"close left\" operation.\n- Time to move from `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)`\n- Time to close tabs to the left of `l`: `1`\nTotal time = `abs(pos - l) + 1`.\n\n**Scenario 4: Tabs on both sides (`[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`) need to be closed.**\nThis happens if `l > 1` and `r < n`.\nWe need to perform two \"close\" operations. The cursor must visit `l` (to close left) and `r` (to close right).\nThe path must cover `l` and `r`. The current position is `pos`.\n\nThere are two main strategies:\n*   **Strategy A: Go to `l`, close left, then go to `r`, close right.**\n    1.  Move `pos` to `l`: `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second.\n    3.  Move `l` to `r`: `abs(l - r)` seconds.\n    4.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second.\n    Total time = `abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1`.\n\n*   **Strategy B: Go to `r`, close right, then go to `l`, close left.**\n    1.  Move `pos` to `r`: `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    2.  Close tabs `[r+1, n]`: `1` second.\n    3.  Move `r` to `l`: `abs(r - l)` seconds.\n    4.  Close tabs `[1, l-1]`: `1` second.\n    Total time = `abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1`.\n\nNotice that `abs(l - r)` is the same as `abs(r - l)`. So, both strategies involve moving the cursor from `pos` to one end (`l` or `r`), then moving across the segment `[l, r]` to the other end.\nThe total distance traveled by the cursor will be `(distance from pos to one end) + (distance between l and r)`.\nThe minimum distance to cover the segment `[l, r]` starting from `pos` is:\n`min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + abs(l - r)`.\nThis covers the movement. Add 2 for the two close operations.\nTotal time = `min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + abs(l - r) + 2`.\n\nLet's combine these observations into a single logic:\n\n1.  Initialize `time_taken = 0`.\n\n2.  **Handle closing tabs to the left of `l`:**\n    If `l > 1`:\n    *   If `pos` is already to the left of `l` (`pos < l`), we need to move `pos` to `l`. Time = `l - pos`.\n    *   If `pos` is to the right of `l` (`pos >= l`), we might have already passed `l` or are at `l`. We just need to ensure `l` is visited. Time `0` for movement to `l` if `pos` is already at or past `l`.\n    *   In essence, if `pos` is to the right of `l`, the movement to `l` is part of covering the segment `[l, r]`. If `pos` is to the left of `l`, we must first move to `l`.\n    A simpler way: if `pos < l`, we *must* move to `l` first, taking `l - pos` seconds. Then we are at `l`, and we perform a close operation.\n    `time_taken += 1` (for closing left)\n    `time_taken += abs(pos - l)` (to move cursor to `l` if `pos < l`, or `0` if `pos >= l` and we are already at or past `l` from the perspective of closing left). This part is tricky to phrase simply.\n\nLet's use the explicit `if/else` structure based on the scenarios:\n\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\ntime_taken = 0\n\n# Case 1: All tabs are within the required range.\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    time_taken = 0\n# Case 2: Only tabs to the right of 'r' need to be closed (l = 1).\nelif l == 1:\n    time_taken = abs(pos - r) + 1\n# Case 3: Only tabs to the left of 'l' need to be closed (r = n).\nelif r == n:\n    time_taken = abs(pos - l) + 1\n# Case 4: Tabs on both sides need to be closed (l > 1 and r < n).\nelse:\n    # We need to visit both 'l' and 'r'.\n    # The cursor must move from 'pos' to 'l', then to 'r', or from 'pos' to 'r', then to 'l'.\n    # The total movement will be:\n    #   (distance from pos to nearest end of [l, r]) + (distance between l and r)\n    # Plus 2 for the two close operations.\n    \n    if pos < l: # Cursor is to the left of the target segment [l, r]\n        time_taken = (l - pos) + (r - l) + 2\n    elif pos > r: # Cursor is to the right of the target segment [l, r]\n        time_taken = (pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n    else: # Cursor is inside the target segment [l, r]\n        # We can go to 'l', close left, then go to 'r', close right.\n        # Or go to 'r', close right, then go to 'l', close left.\n        # Choose the path that minimizes initial movement to an endpoint.\n        time_taken = min(pos - l, r - pos) + (r - l) + 2\n\nprint(time_taken)\n\n```",
