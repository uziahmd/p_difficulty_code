Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Solution to the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem: \"New Year Candles.\" The goal is to figure out the *maximum* hours Vasily can light his room, given some new candles and a way to recycle burnt-out ones into new ones. The problem describes it as starting with `a` new candles, each burning for an hour. Then, `b` burnt-out candles can be used to make a single new candle. The key here is the *maximize* part, which screams simulation to me.\n\nI need to keep track of a few things: the total hours lit (`total_hours`), the number of new candles currently available (`current_new_candles`), and the number of burnt-out candles (`burnt_out_candles`).\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  Initialize `total_hours` to 0, `current_new_candles` to `a`, and `burnt_out_candles` to 0.\n2.  Now, the simulation is a loop that will continue as long as `current_new_candles` is greater than zero:\n    *   **Burn Candles:** Vasily lights all `current_new_candles`. This adds to `total_hours`, and those candles become burnt-out.\n    *   **Craft New Candles:** If there are enough `burnt_out_candles` (at least `b`), Vasily crafts new candles. I use integer division (`//`) to figure out how many new candles are made. I also have to use the modulo operator (`%`) to update the number of remaining burnt-out candles after crafting.\n\nI worked through the example test cases (`a=4, b=2` and `a=6, b=3`). This confirms my logic and makes sure the variables update correctly in the loop.\n\nOkay, the algorithm seems correct. Time to get to the code. Since it says \"The single line contains two integers a and b,\" I know there's only one test case per execution.  I set up the program to read the input from stdin. No need for complicated error handling because the problem says there will be valid inputs. I use a `while` loop to simulate candle burning and crafting. Inside the loop, I have the actions: burning candles, crafting new candles, updating all the counters, and continuing until I have no more candles to burn.\n\nThe tricky part, if there is one, might be that it's stated as a \"hard question.\" Maybe I'm missing something, but this feels like a straightforward simulation. I've considered edge cases like when  `a = 1`, or when `a` and `b` are similar, and it seems the logic holds. Also, the problem says \"Vasily acts optimally well\". So always burning all new candles immediately and crafting new ones is optimal.\n\nI implemented the code, double-checked, and that should be it!\n\n",
