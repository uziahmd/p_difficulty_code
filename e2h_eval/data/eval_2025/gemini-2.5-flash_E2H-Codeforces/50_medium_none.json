    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem called \"Tree Sum\". The goal is to calculate the sum of  *d*(1,*n*) across all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo 998244353.  This means I need to understand what constitutes a \"good\" tree and how to compute *d*(1,*n*).\n\nA \"good\" tree is an edge-weighted tree where, for each vertex *i*, the product of the edge weights incident to *i* is -1.  *d*(1,*n*) is the sum of the weights along the unique path from vertex 1 to vertex *n*. The total number of trees is n^(n-2) * 2^(n-1), however, we only want \"good\" trees.\n\n**Initial Analysis and the Key Insight:**\n\nLet's dig into the \"good\" tree condition.  The product of the incident edge weights at each vertex must be -1. Representing the weight of an edge (u, v) as *w*<sub>uv</sub>.\n\nIf we multiply these conditions across all vertices, we get a global product equal to (-1)^n.  Because each edge contributes twice to the product (once for each endpoint), the product of the square of all edge weights simplifies to 1.  Therefore, we have 1 = (-1)^n.  This immediately tells me that *n* *must* be even for any good tree to exist. If *n* is odd, the sum is 0.\n\n**Building a Solution Strategy (for even *n*):**\n\nAssuming *n* is even, the question is then, how many \"good\" trees are there for each tree structure, since we know there aren't any for odd n.  For a given tree structure (edges without weights), I need to figure out how to assign edge weights to make it \"good\".\n\nI'm thinking of mapping the weights to 0 and 1 using *y* values. This transforms the product conditions into linear equations in the field Z<sub>2</sub>.\n\nI can write down a system of *n* linear equations (one for each vertex) with *n*-1 unknowns (the edge weights). I'm seeing that, since *n* is even, the rank of the incidence matrix is *n*-1. The sum of the equations is 0 modulo 2, implying these equations are linearly dependent.  This means there's a *unique* solution for each tree structure.\n\n**Weight Determination and the Crucial Observation:**\n\nLet's assume we have a tree. After fixing a particular edge *u*,*v*, the edge weight depends on the sizes of the two components created when *u*,*v* is removed. The weight will be 1 if these components have an even number of vertices and -1 if odd. Since n is even, these components will always have the same parity. This implies that there is a unique set of edge weights that are solutions to the \"good\" conditions for each tree structure.\n\nTherefore, the number of good trees is equal to n^(n-2), because we showed there is only one possible assignment of weights.\n\n**Final Steps (Calculating the Sum):**\n\nThe next step is to calculate the sum of *d*(1,*n*) across all these good trees.  *d*(1,*n*) is the sum of the edge weights along the unique path from 1 to *n*.\n\nI need to figure out a smart way to calculate the sum of these path sums over all good trees.\n\nI have found this can be done by using the fact the w(u,v) depends on how it separates 1 from *n*. This implies a clever sum over all trees should be doable.\n\nIf I consider an edge (u,v), then I need a way to figure out which trees contain this edge in the path from 1 to *n*. Given any particular path, the edge weight is determined by removing that edge from the tree, and figuring out the sizes of the components.\n\nNow the problem is reduced to figuring out the sum across n-2 vertices.\n\nI need to analyze how many of the good trees contain each edge in the path from 1 to *n* and what its contribution will be.\n\nI'm getting closer, and I believe I have the right structure to complete the algorithm!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the sum of $d(1,n)$ over all \"good\" edge-weighted trees, modulo $998244353$.\nAn edge-weighted tree has $n$ vertices, and each edge has a weight of either $1$ or $-1$.\nA tree is \"good\" if for each vertex $i$, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to $i$ is $-1$.\n$d(u,v)$ is the sum of weights of edges on the unique simple path from $u$ to $v$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the condition for a \"good\" tree. Let $w_{ij}$ be the weight of edge $(i,j)$.\nFor each vertex $i$, we have $\\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} w_{ij} = -1$.\nConsider the product of these conditions over all vertices:\n$\\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( \\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} w_{ij} \\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (-1) = (-1)^n$.\nIn the left-hand side, each edge weight $w_{uv}$ appears twice (once for vertex $u$ and once for vertex $v$). So, the product is $\\prod_{(u,v) \\in E} (w_{uv})^2$.\nSince $w_{uv} \\in \\{1, -1\\}$, $(w_{uv})^2 = 1$ for all edges. Thus, $\\prod_{(u,v) \\in E} (w_{uv})^2 = 1^{n-1} = 1$.\nEquating the two results, we get $1 = (-1)^n$. This implies that $n$ must be an even number.\nIf $n$ is odd, there are no good trees, so the sum of $d(1,n)$ is $0$. This handles the $n=1$ case.\n\nNow, assume $n$ is even.\nLet's represent edge weights $w_{ij}$ using binary variables $y_{ij} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ such that $w_{ij} = (-1)^{y_{ij}}$.\nThe condition $\\prod_{(i,j) \\in E} w_{ij} = -1$ translates to $\\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} y_{ij} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThis gives a system of $n$ linear equations over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ for the $n-1$ variables $y_{ij}$.\nIt's a known result that for a tree on $n$ vertices, if $n$ is even, this system has a unique solution for $y_{ij}$.\nTherefore, for each of the $n^{n-2}$ possible tree structures on $n$ labeled vertices, there is exactly one way to assign weights to make it a \"good\" tree.\nThe total number of good trees is $n^{n-2}$ (if $n$ is even) and $0$ (if $n$ is odd).\n\nWhat is the value of $w_{uv}$ for a specific edge $(u,v)$ in a good tree?\nConsider an edge $(u,v)$. Removing this edge splits the tree into two connected components. Let $C_u$ be the component containing $u$ and $C_v$ be the component containing $v$. Let $|C_u|=k$.\nSumming the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ equations $\\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} y_{ij} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ for all vertices $i \\in C_u$:\n$\\sum_{i \\in C_u} \\left( \\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} y_{ij} \\right) \\equiv \\sum_{i \\in C_u} 1 \\pmod 2$.\nThe left-hand side sums $y_{xy}$ twice if $(x,y)$ is an edge within $C_u$, and once if $(x,y)$ is the edge $(u,v)$ (which connects $C_u$ and $C_v$). All other edges are within $C_u$ or within $C_v$.\nSo, $\\sum_{i \\in C_u} \\left( \\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} y_{ij} \\right) \\equiv y_{uv} \\pmod 2$.\nThe right-hand side is $|C_u| \\pmod 2 = k \\pmod 2$.\nThus, $y_{uv} \\equiv k \\pmod 2$, which means $w_{uv} = (-1)^{y_{uv}} = (-1)^k$.\nNote that since $n$ is even, $k$ and $n-k$ have the same parity, so $w_{uv} = (-1)^{n-k}$ as well.\n\nWe need to calculate $S = \\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d_T(1,n)$.\n$d_T(1,n) = \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1n,T}} w_{uv,T}$, where $P_{1n,T}$ is the path from $1$ to $n$ in tree $T$.\nSubstituting $w_{uv,T} = (-1)^{k_{uv,T}}$, where $k_{uv,T}$ is the size of the component containing $u$ (or $v$) when $(u,v)$ is removed from $T$.\n\nWe can use the result by A. Cayley: \"The number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices containing a specific edge $(u,v)$ is $2n^{n-3}$ for $n \\ge 2$.\"\nThis formula is for any pair of vertices $(u,v)$.\nThe path $P_{1n,T}$ consists of a sequence of edges.\nConsider an edge $(u,v)$ that is part of the path $P_{1n,T}$. This means that removing $(u,v)$ separates vertex $1$ from vertex $n$.\nLet $S_u$ be the set of vertices in the component containing $u$ after removing $(u,v)$, and $S_v$ be the set of vertices in the component containing $v$.\nFor $(u,v)$ to be on $P_{1n,T}$, it must be that $1 \\in S_u$ and $n \\in S_v$ (or vice versa).\nLet's fix $u$ and $v$. The number of trees where $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge, and $1,u$ are in one component and $n,v$ are in the other, can be found using generalized Cayley formulas.\nThis is equivalent to counting trees on $n$ vertices such that $u$ is connected to $v$, $1$ is connected to $u$ (but not $v$ directly), and $n$ is connected to $v$ (but not $u$ directly).\nThis can be computed by considering the number of trees on $n$ vertices where $1,u$ are in one component $C_1$ and $n,v$ are in another component $C_2$, and $(u,v)$ is an edge connecting $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nThe number of trees on $n$ vertices where $1,u$ are grouped and $n,v$ are grouped is $(n-2)n^{n-4}$ if $n>2$.\nSpecifically, the number of trees on $n$ vertices where $1$ and $u$ are in one component and $n$ and $v$ are in another component, and the edge $(u,v)$ connects these two components, is $n^{n-4}$ if $n>2$.\nThen, $k_{uv,T}$ is the size of the component containing $1$ (and $u$) when $(u,v)$ is removed.\n\nLet's use a simpler approach. By symmetry, for any two distinct vertices $u,v \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the sum of $w_{uv,T}$ over all good trees $T$ where $(u,v)$ is on $P_{1n,T}$ is the same.\nLet's fix $u=1, v=2$.\nThe weight $w_{12}$ in a good tree is $(-1)^k$, where $k$ is the size of the component containing $1$ when $(1,2)$ is removed.\nIf $(1,2)$ is on the path $P_{1n}$, then $1$ and $n$ are separated by $(1,2)$.\nSpecifically, $1$ is in one component, $n$ is in the other.\nThe number of trees where $1$ is in a component of size $k$ and $n$ is in a component of size $n-k$ when edge $(u,v)$ is removed is given by a generalized Cayley's formula.\nThe number of trees where $1$ is in a component of size $k$ and $n$ in a component of size $n-k$ when edge $(u,v)$ is removed is $k(n-k)n^{n-4}$ if $u=1, v=n$. This is for specific $u,v$.\nThe number of trees on $n$ vertices such that $1$ and $n$ are in different components when edge $(u,v)$ is removed is $k^{k-1}(n-k)^{n-k-1}n^{n-2}$? No.\n\nLet's sum over all possible edges $(u,v)$ and all possible sizes $k$ for the component containing $1$.\nThe sum is $\\sum_{u,v \\in V, u \\ne v} \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\sum_{T \\text{ good s.t. } (u,v) \\in P_{1n,T} \\text{ and } |C_1|=k} (-1)^k$.\nThe number of trees where an edge $(u,v)$ exists, and removing it separates $1$ into a component of size $k$ and $n$ into a component of size $n-k$, and $u$ is in the component of $1$, and $v$ is in the component of $n$.\nThis is $k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1}$? No.\nThe number of trees where $1, \\dots, k$ form one component and $k+1, \\dots, n$ form another component, and an edge $(u,v)$ connects them is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is a standard result for counting trees that split into two specified components of sizes $k$ and $n-k$.\nIn our case, $1$ is in one component, $n$ is in the other.\nThe number of trees such that edge $(u,v)$ is on the path $P_{1n}$ and separates $1$ from $n$ into components of size $k$ and $n-k$ (with $1 \\in C_u, n \\in C_v$) is:\nChoose $k-1$ vertices other than $1$ to be in $C_u$: $\\binom{n-2}{k-1}$.\nForm a tree on these $k$ vertices (including $1$) such that $u$ is chosen as one of them: $k^{k-1}$.\nForm a tree on the remaining $n-k$ vertices (including $n$) such that $v$ is chosen as one of them: $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThe total count is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nFor each such tree, the edge $(u,v)$ contributes $(-1)^k$.\nThe sum we want is:\n$S = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} \\cdot (-1)^k$.\nThis formula is valid for $n \\ge 2$.\nIf $n=2$, $k=1$. $\\binom{0}{0} 1^{1-1} (2-1)^{2-1-1} (-1)^1 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\nThis matches the example for $n=2$.\n\nThe sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{(n-2)!}{(k-1)!(n-k-1)!} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$.\nThis is a known identity related to Abel's identity or trees.\n$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = n^{n-3}$ for $n \\ge 2$. (This is for the number of edges on the path $P_{1n}$).\nThe identity we need is: $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$.\nThis sum is related to the number of spanning trees with certain properties.\nThe value of this sum is $-(n-2)n^{n-4}$ for $n \\ge 3$.\nLet's check for $n=4$:\n$S = \\binom{2}{0} 1^0 3^2 (-1)^1 + \\binom{2}{1} 2^1 2^1 (-1)^2 + \\binom{2}{2} 3^2 1^0 (-1)^3$\n$S = (1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot (-1)) + (2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1))$\n$S = -9 + 8 - 9 = -10$.\nThis matches the example for $n=4$.\nThe formula $-(n-2)n^{n-4}$ works for $n=4$: $-(4-2)4^{4-4} = -2 \\cdot 4^0 = -2 \\cdot 1 = -2$.\nWait, the example is $-10$. My formula is wrong.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the sum.\nThe sum is $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$.\nThis can be written as:\n$S = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{(n-2)!}{(k-1)!(n-k-1)!} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$.\nLet $j=k-1$.\n$S = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} \\frac{(n-2)!}{j!(n-2-j)!} (j+1)^{j} (n-j-1)^{n-j-2} (-1)^{j+1}$.\n$S = - \\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} \\binom{n-2}{j} (j+1)^{j} (n-j-1)^{n-j-2} (-1)^{j}$.\n\nThis is a known identity related to the number of spanning forests.\nFor $n \\ge 3$: $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k = (-1)^{n-1} (n-2)n^{n-4}$.\nSince $n$ is even, $n-1$ is odd. So $(-1)^{n-1} = -1$.\nThus, $S = -(n-2)n^{n-4}$.\nFor $n=4$, $S = -(4-2)4^{4-4} = -2 \\cdot 1 = -2$. Still not -10.\n\nWhat is wrong? The sum is over $k$, the size of the component containing $1$.\nThe number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices where vertex $1$ is in a component of size $k$ and vertex $n$ is in a component of size $n-k$ and there is an edge $(u,v)$ connecting these two components, where $u$ is in the component of $1$ and $v$ in the component of $n$.\nThe formula $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$ counts the number of ways to pick $k-1$ other vertices to be with $1$, form a tree on these $k$ vertices, form a tree on the remaining $n-k$ vertices, and then pick one vertex from the first component and one from the second to connect them.\nThis means $k^{k-1}$ choices for tree $T_1$, $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$ choices for tree $T_2$.\nThen choose $u \\in C_1$ ($k$ choices) and $v \\in C_2$ ($n-k$ choices).\nSo the number of trees is $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} \\times k \\times (n-k)$.\nThis simplifies to $\\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^k (n-k)^{n-k}$.\n\nSo the sum is $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^k (n-k)^{n-k} (-1)^k$.\nLet's check for $n=4$:\n$S = \\binom{2}{0} 1^1 3^3 (-1)^1 + \\binom{2}{1} 2^2 2^2 (-1)^2 + \\binom{2}{2} 3^3 1^1 (-1)^3$\n$S = (1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 27 \\cdot (-1)) + (2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1) + (1 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1))$\n$S = -27 + 32 - 27 = -22$. Still not -10.\n\nThe formula for the sum of $d(1,n)$ for good trees is $-(n-2) \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot n^{n-4}$ when $n \\ge 3$.\nLet's check $n=4$: $-(4-2)(4-1)4^{4-4} = -2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 = -6$. Still not $-10$.\n\nLet's use a different perspective.\nThe sum $\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} d_T(1,n)$ can be written as $\\sum_{T \\text{ good}} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in E_T} \\mathbb{I}((u,v) \\in P_{1n,T}) w_{uv,T}$.\nThis is $\\sum_{u,v \\in V, u \\ne v} \\sum_{T \\text{ good s.t. } (u,v) \\in P_{1n,T}} w_{uv,T}$.\nThe number of trees where $(u,v)$ is on $P_{1n}$ is $2(n-2)n^{n-4}$ for $n \\ge 3$.\nFor $n=4$, this is $2(2)4^0 = 4$.\nFor each such tree, $w_{uv,T} = (-1)^k$.\nThe sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$ is actually the sum of contributions of *one specific edge* $(u,v)$ if $u=1$ and $v=n$.\nThe sum $S_n$ is the total sum of $w_{uv}$ for edges $(u,v)$ on the path $P_{1n}$ where $u$ is in the component of size $k$ (containing $1$) and $v$ is in the component of size $n-k$ (containing $n$).\nThis is exactly the sum we need to calculate.\nThe sum $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$\nFor $n=4$, we got $-2$. The example gives $-10$. This means I'm missing a factor.\n\nThe sum $S_n$ is the sum of $d(1,n)$ over *all* good trees.\nThe formula $-(n-2)n^{n-4}$ is for $n \\ge 3$.\nThe number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices such that $1$ and $n$ are connected by a path of length $j$ is $j \\binom{n-2}{j-1} n^{n-j-2}$.\nThe sum $S_n = \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\sum_{\\text{paths of length } j} \\sum_{T \\text{ good with this path}} \\sum_{(u,v) \\in P_{1n,T}} w_{uv,T}$.\n\nLet's reconsider the definition of $w_{uv} = (-1)^k$.\nThe sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$ is indeed the correct formula for the sum of $d(1,n)$ over all good trees.\nHowever, it is known that $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} x^k = \\frac{n^{n-2}}{x} (1+x)^{n-2}$ for some $x$.\nThis specific sum is related to a more general identity:\n$\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (x+ky)^{k-1} (z+(n-k)y)^{n-k-1} = \\frac{(x+z+ny)^n - (x+z+ny)^{n-1}y n}{x z}$. This is too complex.\n\nLet's use a simpler identity:\n$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} = n^{n-3}$ for $n \\ge 2$. (This counts the number of edges on the path $P_{1n}$ averaged over all trees).\nThe sum we need is $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$.\nThe value of this sum is $-(n-2) \\cdot n^{n-4}$ for $n \\ge 3$.\nThis is what I got before, and it gave $-2$ for $n=4$.\nThe example output for $n=4$ is $-10 \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThere must be a factor of $(n-1)$ or something similar.\n\nLet's re-check for $n=2$: $S_2 = \\binom{0}{0} 1^{0} (1)^{0} (-1)^1 = -1$.\nFormula $-(n-2)n^{n-4}$ for $n=2$ gives $-(2-2)2^{2-4} = 0$. So this formula is for $n \\ge 3$.\n\nThe identity for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$ is actually $-(n-1)n^{n-3}$ for $n \\ge 2$ where $n$ is even.\nLet's check this:\nFor $n=2$: $-(2-1)2^{2-3} = -1 \\cdot 2^{-1} = -1/2$. This is not an integer. So this formula is also wrong.\n\nLet $A(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$.\nFor $n=2$, $A(2) = \\binom{0}{0} 1^0 1^0 (-1)^1 = -1$.\nFor $n=4$, $A(4) = -9 + 8 - 9 = -10$.\nThis matches the examples perfectly!\nSo the task is to compute $A(n)$ modulo $998244353$.\n\nThe constraints are $n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5$.\nWe need to compute factorials and their inverses for $\\binom{n-2}{k-1}$.\nWe need to compute powers $k^{k-1}$ and $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThe sum has $n-1$ terms. A direct sum takes $O(N \\log N)$ time.\n$N=5 \\cdot 10^5$ is too slow for $O(N \\log N)$. It would be $O(N)$ for powers if we precompute.\n$O(N)$ is too slow. $5 \\cdot 10^5$ operations is fine. $5 \\cdot 10^5 \\log(5 \\cdot 10^5)$ is too slow.\nWe need $O(N)$ or $O(N \\alpha(N))$ or $O(\\log N)$ or $O(1)$.\n\nThe sum is $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{(n-2)!}{(k-1)!(n-k-1)!} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$.\nWe need to compute this in $O(N)$ time.\nPrecompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo $998244353$.\nThen for each $k$, compute $k^{k-1}$ and $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nPowers like $k^{k-1}$ and $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$ can be computed in $O(\\log k)$ and $O(\\log(n-k))$ time.\nTotal time $O(N \\log N)$. This is too slow.\n\nThe only way to make it faster is if there's a closed form or a recurrence.\nThe formula $A(n)$ does not seem to have a simple closed form like $-(n-2)n^{n-4}$.\nThe identity $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n-2}{k-1} k^{k-1} (n-k)^{n-k-1} (-1)^k$ has been evaluated to $-(n-1)n^{n-3}$ for $n \\ge 2$ in some sources, but it's incorrect.\n\nThe problem states $n$ is a positive integer.\nIf $n=1$, output 0.\nIf $n$ is odd and $n>1$, output 0.\nIf $n$ is even, we need to compute the sum.\n\nLet's check the modulo $998244353$. It's a prime.\nWe need to compute $k^{k-1}$ and $(n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nUsing $a^b \\pmod M$.\nWe can compute all powers $i^j$ by iterating $i=1 \\ldots n$ and $j=1 \\ldots n$.\nBut we need $i^{i-1}$. This is not a simple pattern.\n\nIs there a way to use generating functions or polynomial multiplication?\nThe terms are $\\frac{1}{(k-1)!} k^{k-1} (-1)^k \\cdot \\frac{1}{(n-k-1)!} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nLet $a_j = \\frac{1}{j!} (j+1)^j (-1)^{j+1}$ and $b_j = \\frac{1}{j!} (j+1)^j$.\nThe sum is $(n-2)! \\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} a_j b_{n-2-j}$. This is a convolution.\nLet $f(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} \\frac{(j+1)^j}{j!} (-1)^{j+1} x^j$ and $g(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} \\frac{(j+1)^j}{j!} x^j$.\nThe coefficient of $x^{n-2}$ in $f(x)g(x)$ is $\\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} \\frac{(j+1)^j}{j!} (-1)^{j+1} \\frac{(n-j-1)^{n-j-2}}{(n-j-2)!}$.\nThis is $(n-2)! \\sum_{j=0}^{n-2} \\frac{(j+1)^j}{j!} (-1)^{j+1} \\frac{(n-j-1)^{n-j-2}}{(n-j-2)!} \\frac{1}{(n-2)!}$.\nNo, this is not exactly the sum. The power is $k^{k-1}$ not $(k+1)^k$.\nLet $A_j = \\frac{j^{j-1}}{(j-1)!} (-1)^j$ and $B_j = \\frac{j^{j-1}}{(j-1)!}$.\nThen $S_n = (n-2)! \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{A_k B_{n-k}}{(-1)^k}$. No.\n\nLet $a_k = \\frac{k^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} (-1)^k$ and $b_k = \\frac{k^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}$.\nThe sum is $(n-2)! \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{(k-1)!} k^{k-1} (-1)^k \\cdot \\frac{1}{(n-k-1)!} (n-k)^{n-k-1}$.\nThis is $(n-2)! \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k' b_{n-k}'$, where $a_k' = \\frac{k^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} (-1)^k$ and $b_k' = \\frac{(n-k)^{n-k-1}}{(n-k-1)!}$.\nThis is a convolution. We can compute this using NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) in $O(N \\log N)$ time.\nThis is still too slow. $N \\log N$ for $N=5 \\cdot 10^5$ is about $5 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 19 \\approx 10^7$ operations. This might pass.\n\nLet's check the time complexity for NTT.\n$N=5 \\cdot 10^5$. We need to pad to the next power of 2, which is $2^{19} = 524288$.\nThe modulo is $998244353 = 119 \\cdot 2^{23} + 1$. This is a good prime for NTT.\nSo, $O(N \\log N)$ should be acceptable.\n\nSteps:\n1.  Handle base cases:\n    If $n=1$, answer is 0.\n    If $n$ is odd, answer is 0.\n2.  Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo $998244353$ up to $n$.\n3.  Precompute powers $i^{i-1} \\pmod{M}$ for $i=1 \\dots n$. Note $1^{1-1} = 1^0 = 1$.\n    These can be computed in $O(N)$ time if we compute $i^0, i^1, \\dots, i^{N-1}$ for each $i$. No, this is wrong.\n    We need $i^{i-1}$. We can compute this in $O(N \\log N)$ using modular exponentiation for each term.\n    Or, compute $i^{i-1}$ using $i^{i-1} = i^{i-2} \\cdot i^{-1}$ (if $i-1 \\ge 1$).\n    For $i=1$, $1^0=1$. For $i=2$, $2^1=2$. For $i=3$, $3^2=9$.\n    This is not a simple recurrence. So $O(N \\log N)$ for powers.\n    This makes the overall complexity $O(N \\log N)$.\n\nLet $P_k = k^{k-1} \\pmod M$. $P_1 = 1$.\nDefine two polynomials:\n$A(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{P_k}{(k-1)!} (-1)^k x^k$\n$B(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{P_k}{(k-1)!} x^k$\nWe want to compute $(n-2)! \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{P_k}{(k-1)!} (-1)^k \\frac{P_{n-k}}{(n-k-1)!}$.\nLet's define $A_k = \\frac{P_k}{(k-1)!} (-1)^k$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\nLet $B_k = \\frac{P_k}{(k-1)!}$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$.\nThe sum is $(n-2)! \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} A_k B_{n-k}$.\nThis is a convolution $C_m = \\sum_{k=1}^{m-1} A_k B_{m-k}$.\nWe need $C_n$.\nLet $A'(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} A_k x^k$ and $B'(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} B_k x^k$.\nThen $A'(x)B'(x) = \\sum_{m=2}^{2n-2} (\\sum_{k=1}^{m-1} A_k B_{m-k}) x^m$.\nThe coefficient of $x^n$ in $A'(x)B'(x)$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} A_k B_{n-k}$.\nThis is exactly what we need.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.  Read $n$.\n2.  If $n$ is odd, print 0 and exit.\n3.  If $n=2$, print $998244352$ (which is $-1 \\pmod M$) and exit.\n4.  Set $MOD = 998244353$.\n5.  Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo $MOD$ up to $n$.\n    `fact[i] = i!`\n    `inv_fact[i] = (i!)^{-1}`\n6.  Precompute `pow_k_k_minus_1[k] = k^{k-1} % MOD` for $k=1 \\dots n$.\n    `pow_k_k_minus_1[1] = 1`. For $k>1$, use modular exponentiation `pow(k, k-1, MOD)`. This takes $O(N \\log N)$.\n7.  Construct polynomial coefficients for $A'(x)$ and $B'(x)$:\n    `poly_A = [0] * (n+1)`\n    `poly_B = [0] * (n+1)`\n    For $k = 1 \\dots n-1$:\n        `term = pow_k_k_minus_1[k] * inv_fact[k-1] % MOD`\n        `poly_A[k] = term`\n        If $k$ is odd, `poly_A[k] = (MOD - poly_A[k]) % MOD`.\n        `poly_B[k] = term`\n8.  Perform NTT on `poly_A` and `poly_B`. Let the result be `ntt_A` and `ntt_B`.\n    The length of polynomials for NTT should be $L = 2^{\\lceil \\log_2(2n-1) \\rceil}$.\n    For $N=5 \\cdot 10^5$, $2n-1 \\approx 10^6$. So $L = 2^{20} = 1048576$.\n9.  Compute element-wise product `ntt_C[i] = ntt_A[i] * ntt_B[i] % MOD`.\n10. Perform inverse NTT on `ntt_C` to get `poly_C`.\n11. The required sum is `poly_C[n] * fact[n-2] % MOD`.\n    Remember to handle negative numbers in modulo arithmetic. `(val % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.\n\nMaximum value of $n$ is $5 \\cdot 10^5$.\n$N \\log N$ for $N=5 \\cdot 10^5$ and $\\log N \\approx 19$.\nThis is $5 \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 19 \\approx 9.5 \\cdot 10^6$.\nThis should pass within 1-2 seconds.\n\nFinal check on edge cases:\n$n=1$: odd, output 0. Correct.\n$n=2$: even, path $1-2$. $d(1,2) = w_{12}$. $k=1$, so $w_{12}=(-1)^1 = -1$. Output $-1 \\pmod M$. Correct.\nThe NTT approach requires $n \\ge 2$. For $n=2$, the sum is $k=1$ term: $\\binom{0}{0} 1^0 1^0 (-1)^1 = -1$.\nThe convolution definition for $n=2$:\n$A'(x) = A_1 x^1 = \\frac{1^0}{0!} (-1)^1 x = -x$.\n$B'(x) = B_1 x^1 = \\frac{1^0}{0!} x = x$.\n$A'(x)B'(x) = -x^2$.\nCoefficient of $x^2$ is $-1$.\nMultiply by $(n-2)! = 0! = 1$. Result is $-1$. This is consistent.\nSo the general formula holds for $n=2$ as well.\nThe special handling for $n=2$ can be removed.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    MOD = 998244353\n\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    if n == 1: # Although covered by n%2 != 0, good to explicitly state\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # NTT implementation for convolution\n    # Based on standard competitive programming library implementations\n    # Modulo is 998244353, which is 119 * 2^23 + 1\n    # Primitive root is 3\n    \n    ROOT = 3\n    INV_ROOT = pow(ROOT, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n    def ntt(a, inverse):\n        l = len(a)\n        j = 0\n        for i in range(1, l):\n            bit = l >> 1\n            while j >= bit:\n                j -= bit\n                bit >>= 1\n            j += bit\n            if i < j:\n                a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n        len_half = 1\n        while len_half < l:\n            len_half <<= 1\n            w_m = pow(INV_ROOT if inverse else ROOT, (MOD - 1) // len_half, MOD)\n            \n            for i in range(0, l, len_half):\n                w = 1\n                for k in range(len_half // 2):\n                    t = (a[i + k + len_half // 2] * w) % MOD\n                    u = a[i + k]\n                    a[i + k] = (u + t) % MOD\n                    a[i + k + len_half // 2] = (u - t + MOD) % MOD\n                    w = (w * w_m) % MOD\n        \n        if inverse:\n            inv_l = pow(l, MOD - 2, MOD)\n            for i in range(l):\n                a[i] = (a[i] * inv_l) % MOD\n        return a\n\n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials\n    max_val = n\n    fact = [1] * (max_val + 1)\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_val + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_val + 1):\n        fact[i] = (fact[i-1] * i) % MOD\n    inv_fact[max_val] = pow(fact[max_val], MOD - 2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_val - 1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = (inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1)) % MOD\n\n    # Precompute k^(k-1)\n    pow_k_k_minus_1 = [0] * (max_val + 1)\n    pow_k_k_minus_1[1] = 1 # 1^(1-1) = 1^0 = 1\n    for k in range(2, max_val + 1):\n        pow_k_k_minus_1[k] = pow(k, k - 1, MOD)\n\n    # Construct polynomial coefficients\n    # A_k = (k^(k-1) / (k-1)!) * (-1)^k\n    # B_k = (k^(k-1) / (k-1)!)\n    # We need the coefficient of x^n in (sum A_k x^k) * (sum B_k x^k)\n    # The sum is (n-2)! * (coefficient of x^n)\n    \n    # The maximum index for k is n-1.
