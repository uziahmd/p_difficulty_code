Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**The Pythonic Pursuit of Polygon Angles**\n\nAlright, here's the deal: I need to cook up a Python script to hunt down three vertices – let's call them v1, v2, and v3 – from a regular, convex n-gon. The goal is to make the angle v1-v2-v3 as darn close as possible to a given angle 'a'. It's all about minimizing that difference.\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about the n-gon's properties. It's inscribed in a circle, so I can use circle geometry. The central angle for each side is 360/n degrees. Now, any angle formed by these vertices is an *inscribed* angle, half the measure of the arc it intercepts. I'll pick v2 as my base, fixing it as vertex 1. Then I just need to figure out the best v1 and v3.\n\nTo find the angle, I need to know how many segments are on the arc.  Let's number the vertices clockwise from 1 to n. Say v1 is at index `1 + i` and v3 is at `1 + j`. I have to be careful with the modulo, making sure the angle covers all of the arc from v1 to v3 (not the arc including v2).\n\nI can re-index the vertices so that v2 is vertex 0.  Then my goal is to find vertices `i` and `j` where `i` and `j` are the vertices around v2. The segments in-between `i` and `j` forms the inscribed angle.  I can think of it as finding the arc `v1 - v3` which does not include the vertex `v2` on the circle.\n\nLet me think. I'm going to set `v2` as the vertex 1.  Let `v1` be `1 + k1`, and `v3` be `1 + k2`.  The angle `v1-v2-v3` will depend on the arc from `v1` to `v3`. The number of segments is `k`. The angle is `k * (180/n)`. `k` starts at `1`, since `v1, v2, v3` must be distinct. Now, what's the upper bound on `k`? It's `n - 2`, as `v1, v2, v3` must be distinct.\n\nSo, the possible angles are `k * (180/n)` where k goes from 1 to n-2. That means I just need to loop and find the best one!\n\nI will loop from `k=1` to `n-2`. For each k, I calculate the `angle = k * (180/n)` and the `diff = |angle - a|`. I want the smallest `diff`, and I'll keep track of the `best_k`.\n\nOnce I find the best `k`, I just need to construct the vertices. Fixing `v2=1` makes things easy. Then I set `v1=2`, so that it is adjacent to `v2`. For `v3`, `v3 = 2 + best_k`. This will give the correct segments in-between. The result is `2 1 (2 + best_k)`. Let me go through a couple test cases in my head to make sure I am doing this right. The math works out.\n\nThe code should be efficient enough, even for large n, since I only loop n-2 times.  No precision issues that I can see.  This approach is solid, easy to implement in Python, and hopefully, gets me that sweet, sweet solution.\n",
