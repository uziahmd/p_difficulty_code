Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break this down.** The task at hand is to solve the \"Crazy Town\" problem using a Python script. My approach is pretty straightforward:\n\nI've been thinking about the core idea, and it boils down to identifying the lines (roads) that *actually* separate the starting point (home) and the destination (university). The crucial insight here is the use of the equation `ax + by + c = 0` to determine which side of the line a given point lies on. This is where the sign of `ax + by + c` comes into play. If the signs are different for the home and university, that means we *have* to cross that particular line to get from one point to the other, which contributes a step.\n\nI considered the algorithm itself; it's quite simple, really. First, I have to read the home and university coordinates, and the number of roads.  Then, for each road, I have to calculate  `ax + by + c` for both the home and university locations using the provided coefficients. If the signs of those results are different, I increment the step count. In the end, the count represents the *minimum* number of moves.\n\nI verified the example provided in the problem statement. The algorithm works, and the Python implementation is straightforward and doesn't have any overflow concerns due to Python's integer handling.\n\nFinally, I considered those boundary cases. It is crucial to see whether the algorithm is robust. All lines must be considered. After thinking about the different possible cases, I realized that the core of the problem is just counting lines that \"separate\" the home and university. It's a fundamental concept in this problem, which is made explicit through the statement \"if the length of their common border is nonzero\". This condition ensures you can't sneak through an intersection without crossing a line, which is exactly how the script is intended to work.\n\nThe code reflects this thinking: it reads the inputs, iterates through each line, checks if that line separates the home and university (by comparing the signs of the calculated `ax + by + c` values), and increments the step count if it does. This seems to be the minimal viable solution for this problem. I am confident that the code handles all required scenarios given the problem.\n",
