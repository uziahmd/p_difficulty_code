They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Playoff Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Playoff\" problem and my initial thought is, \"Python script, let's go!\" But first, I need to understand what I'm dealing with.  We have this tournament structure with $2^n$ teams, each with a distinct skill level represented by a permutation of integers from 1 to $2^n$. The tournament unfolds in phases, and the outcome of each game within a phase is determined by this string, *s*. A '0' means the lower skill wins, and a '1' means the higher skill wins. My goal is to find all the \"winning integers,\" or skill levels that *could* win the tournament given the right initial skill assignment.\n\nMy first instinct is to analyze the tournament in terms of individual matches. A team with skill *x* needs to win *n* games to claim the championship. Let's start by considering the extreme scenarios: what are the minimum and maximum skill levels that could *possibly* win?\n\nOkay, let's take a look at a specific scenario where all $s_i$ are '0'. That makes it straightforward; the team with the lowest skill should win. If skill *x* wants to win, it will always go up against a team of higher skill, because '0' means lower wins. This means if I pick skill 1, it will be the lowest, and will always defeat the other team. However, this line of reasoning is a bit too simple, it's not looking at the overall tournament!\n\nWe can start to look at what conditions are necessary for a team with skill *x* to win. If we consider what could potentially be a champion, that team would need to win over *n* opponents. The string *s* holds the key for determining how to get the right outcome, so that a team with skill *x* can win.\n\nLet's begin to work through some specific examples to understand how the *s* string influences the outcomes.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ that can win a playoff tournament, given a string $s$ that dictates game outcomes. $s_i = '0'$ means the lower-skilled team wins in phase $i+1$, and $s_i = '1'$ means the higher-skilled team wins in phase $i+1$. There are $2^n$ teams in total, and their skill levels are a permutation of $1, \\ldots, 2^n$.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $x$ to win the tournament.\nA team needs to win $n$ games to become the champion.\nIn each phase $i$ (0-indexed, $i=0, \\ldots, n-1$), the rule $s_i$ applies.\n\nConsider a team with skill $x$. To win a game, $x$ must satisfy the condition for that phase.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, $x$ must be less than its opponent's skill.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, $x$ must be greater than its opponent's skill.\n\nLet $c_0$ be the count of '0's in $s$, and $c_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\nA team with skill $x$ must win $c_0$ games where it is the lower skilled player, and $c_1$ games where it is the higher skilled player.\n\nTo win $c_0$ games as the lower skilled player, $x$ must be smaller than $c_0$ distinct opponents. The smallest possible value $x$ can take while satisfying this is $1$ (it's smaller than any other skill). The largest possible value $x$ can take is $2^n - c_0$. If $x = 2^n - c_0$, it would need to be smaller than $c_0$ opponents. These opponents must have skills greater than $x$. The $c_0$ smallest skills greater than $x$ are $2^n - c_0 + 1, \\ldots, 2^n$. This is possible.\n\nTo win $c_1$ games as the higher skilled player, $x$ must be larger than $c_1$ distinct opponents. The largest possible value $x$ can take while satisfying this is $2^n$ (it's larger than any other skill). The smallest possible value $x$ can take is $c_1 + 1$. If $x = c_1 + 1$, it would need to be larger than $c_1$ opponents. These opponents must have skills smaller than $x$. The $c_1$ largest skills smaller than $x$ are $1, \\ldots, c_1$. This is possible.\n\nCombining these, for a team with skill $x$ to be able to win, it must be possible to find $n$ opponents (who themselves must have won their prior games) such that $x$ is smaller than $c_0$ of them and larger than $c_1$ of them.\n\nLet's consider the range of possible skill values for the winner.\nMinimum possible skill for a winner:\nTo win $c_1$ games as the higher skill, $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ opponents. The smallest $x$ can be is $c_1+1$. For example, if $x=c_1+1$, it can defeat opponents with skills $1, \\ldots, c_1$.\nSo, $x \\ge c_1+1$.\n\nMaximum possible skill for a winner:\nTo win $c_0$ games as the lower skill, $x$ must be smaller than $c_0$ opponents. The largest $x$ can be is $2^n - c_0$. For example, if $x=2^n-c_0$, it can defeat opponents with skills $2^n - c_0 + 1, \\ldots, 2^n$.\nSo, $x \\le 2^n - c_0$.\n\nThus, any winning skill $x$ must satisfy $c_1+1 \\le x \\le 2^n - c_0$.\nLet's check if all integers in this range are winning integers.\nConsider an integer $x$ such that $c_1+1 \\le x \\le 2^n - c_0$.\nCan we construct a permutation $p$ such that team $x$ wins?\nYes. We can place $x$ at any initial position.\nFor the $c_1$ games where $x$ must be higher skilled, we assign opponents with skills $1, \\ldots, c_1$.\nFor the $c_0$ games where $x$ must be lower skilled, we assign opponents with skills $2^n - c_0 + 1, \\ldots, 2^n$.\nThis uses $c_1$ skills smaller than $x$, and $c_0$ skills larger than $x$.\nThe total number of opponents needed is $n = c_0 + c_1$.\nThe skills used are $1, \\ldots, c_1$, and $2^n - c_0 + 1, \\ldots, 2^n$.\nThese two sets of skills are disjoint if $c_1 < 2^n - c_0 + 1$.\nSince $x \\ge c_1+1$ and $x \\le 2^n-c_0$, we have $c_1+1 \\le 2^n-c_0$, which implies $c_1+c_0+1 \\le 2^n$. Since $c_0+c_1=n$, this means $n+1 \\le 2^n$. This inequality holds for all $n \\ge 1$.\nSo, the sets of skills $\\{1, \\ldots, c_1\\}$ and $\\{2^n - c_0 + 1, \\ldots, 2^n\\}$ are disjoint and do not include $x$.\nWe can assign these $n$ skills to be the skills of the teams that $x$ eventually plays against and defeats. The remaining $2^n - (n+1)$ skills can be assigned to the other teams in any way. The specific structure of the tournament (who plays whom in which round) does not restrict $x$ further, as long as we can find $n$ distinct opponents satisfying the skill conditions. The problem states \"it is possible to find a permutation $p$\", implying we have full control over initial team placements.\n\nTherefore, the winning integers are precisely those in the range $[c_1+1, 2^n - c_0]$.\n\nLet's calculate $c_0$ and $c_1$:\n$c_0$ = count of '0's in $s$.\n$c_1$ = count of '1's in $s$.\nThe minimum winning skill is $c_1 + 1$.\nThe maximum winning skill is $2^n - c_0$.\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$c_0 = 1$ (for $s_1='0'$)\n$c_1 = 2$ (for $s_0='1', s_2='1'$)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\nMinimum winning skill: $c_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nMaximum winning skill: $2^n - c_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\nThe winning integers are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nWait, the example output is `4 5 6 7`. What's wrong?\n\nThe mistake is in assuming that $x$ can be any value in the range. The definition of $c_0$ and $c_1$ is correct, but the number of skills available to be *opponents* for $x$ is not $c_1$ skills smaller than $x$ and $c_0$ skills larger than $x$.\nThe $c_1$ opponents $x$ beats must have skills $1, \\ldots, c_1$.\nThe $c_0$ opponents $x$ beats must have skills $2^n - c_0 + 1, \\ldots, 2^n$.\nThis means that for $x$ to beat $c_1$ opponents smaller than it, those opponents must be drawn from skills $1, \\ldots, x-1$. There are $x-1$ such skills. So we need $x-1 \\ge c_1$. This means $x \\ge c_1+1$.\nFor $x$ to beat $c_0$ opponents larger than it, those opponents must be drawn from skills $x+1, \\ldots, 2^n$. There are $2^n - x$ such skills. So we need $2^n - x \\ge c_0$. This means $x \\le 2^n - c_0$.\n\nThis logic is sound, but it doesn't consider the fact that the opponents themselves must be able to win their way to face $x$. The problem simplifies this by saying \"it is possible to find a permutation $p$\", which implies we can assign skills to teams in a way that facilitates $x$'s victory. The *only* constraints on $x$ are the $n$ games it plays.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully: \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins; if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\n\nThe key might be in the phrasing \"in *each* match\". This means the rule applies universally.\nA team with skill $x$ wins $c_0$ games by being lower and $c_1$ games by being higher.\nThe $c_0$ games where $x$ is lower: $x$ must be smaller than its opponents. The opponents must have skills $y_1, \\ldots, y_{c_0}$ such that $y_j > x$.\nThe $c_1$ games where $x$ is higher: $x$ must be larger than its opponents. The opponents must have skills $z_1, \\ldots, z_{c_1}$ such that $z_j < x$.\nAll $y_j$ and $z_j$ must be distinct from each other and from $x$.\nSo we need $c_1$ distinct skills less than $x$, and $c_0$ distinct skills greater than $x$.\nThe number of skills less than $x$ is $x-1$. So $x-1 \\ge c_1 \\implies x \\ge c_1+1$.\nThe number of skills greater than $x$ is $2^n - x$. So $2^n - x \\ge c_0 \\implies x \\le 2^n - c_0$.\nThis leads to the range $[c_1+1, 2^n - c_0]$.\n\nWhy is the example output different?\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$s_0='1'$, $s_1='0'$, $s_2='1'$.\n$c_0=1, c_1=2$.\nMy logic: min_win $= c_1+1 = 3$. max_win $= 2^3 - c_0 = 8 - 1 = 7$. Range $[3, 7]$. Output: `3 4 5 6 7`.\nExample output: `4 5 6 7`. My minimum is off by 1.\n\nThe problem implies that $s_i$ corresponds to the $i$-th phase *in order*.\nPhase 1: $2^{n-1}$ games. $s_0$ rule applies.\nPhase 2: $2^{n-2}$ games. $s_1$ rule applies.\n...\nPhase $n$: $2^0=1$ game (the final). $s_{n-1}$ rule applies.\n\nLet's consider the number of games played *before* a specific phase rule applies.\nThe $i$-th character $s_i$ corresponds to phase $i+1$.\nA team that wins the tournament plays one game in each phase $1, \\ldots, n$.\nSo, it plays a game under rule $s_0$, then a game under rule $s_1$, ..., up to $s_{n-1}$.\nThe counts $c_0$ and $c_1$ are correct.\n\nCould it be related to the number of teams that *could* win a game in a given phase?\nIf $s_i='0'$, the lower skill wins. There are $2^{n-i}$ winners. These winners must have skills lower than their opponents.\nIf $s_i='1'$, the higher skill wins. There are $2^{n-i}$ winners. These winners must have skills higher than their opponents.\n\nLet's consider the *total number of teams* that can potentially survive a phase.\nIf $s_i='0'$, then in each game, the smaller skill wins. This means $2^{n-i}$ teams survive, and they are the smaller skills in their pairs.\nIf $s_i='1'$, then in each game, the larger skill wins. This means $2^{n-i}$ teams survive, and they are the larger skills in their pairs.\n\nConsider the set of teams that can reach the final.\nAfter phase 1 ($s_0$ rule), $2^{n-1}$ teams remain.\nAfter phase 2 ($s_1$ rule), $2^{n-2}$ teams remain.\n...\nAfter phase $n-1$ ($s_{n-2}$ rule), 2 teams remain.\nAfter phase $n$ ($s_{n-1}$ rule), 1 team remains.\n\nLet's count how many teams must be eliminated by being smaller/larger.\nIf $s_i = '0'$, the lower skill wins. So the higher skill is eliminated.\nIf $s_i = '1'$, the higher skill wins. So the lower skill is eliminated.\n\nLet's count the number of teams eliminated by being too low, and by being too high.\nA team with skill $X$ can only win if it's not eliminated.\nConsider a team with skill $X$.\nIt plays $n$ games.\nFor $c_0$ games, it must be the lower skill. $X < \\text{opponent}$.\nFor $c_1$ games, it must be the higher skill. $X > \\text{opponent}$.\n\nWhat if we consider the effect of $s$ on the *range* of possible skills?\nLet $L_i$ be the minimum skill that can win phase $i$, and $R_i$ be the maximum skill that can win phase $i$.\nThis is not quite right. A team needs to win $n$ games.\n\nLet's consider the number of teams that *could* win based on $s$.\nTotal teams $2^n$.\nLet $k_0$ be the count of '0's in $s$.\nLet $k_1$ be the count of '1's in $s$.\nA team $X$ must win $k_0$ games by being smaller than its opponent, and $k_1$ games by being larger than its opponent.\nThis means $X$ must be able to find $k_0$ opponents with skill $>X$ and $k_1$ opponents with skill $<X$.\nThe smallest $X$ can be is $k_1+1$. (It needs $k_1$ skills smaller than it, $1, \\ldots, k_1$).\nThe largest $X$ can be is $2^n-k_0$. (It needs $k_0$ skills larger than it, $2^n-k_0+1, \\ldots, 2^n$).\nSo the range of possible winning skills is $[k_1+1, 2^n-k_0]$.\n\nThis is the exact same logic as before. Why does it not match the example?\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n$k_0=1, k_1=2$. $2^n=8$.\nRange: $[2+1, 8-1] = [3, 7]$.\nExample output: $[4, 7]$.\n\nThe difference is $2^{k_1}$ and $2^n - 2^{k_0} + 1$.\nNo, this is wrong. The example output minimum is $4$.\nMy minimum is $c_1+1 = 3$.\nMy maximum is $2^n - c_0 = 7$.\nThe example output for $n=3, s=\"101\"$ is `4 5 6 7`.\nThe minimum is $2^{c_1}$. No, $2^{c_1}=2^2=4$. This matches.\nThe maximum is $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$. No, $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 8 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$. This matches.\n\nSo, the range is $[2^{c_1}, 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1]$.\n\nLet's try to understand why this would be the case.\n$c_1$ is the number of times the winner must be the higher skill.\n$c_0$ is the number of times the winner must be the lower skill.\n\nConsider the minimum winning skill.\nTo win $c_1$ games as the higher skill, $X$ must be greater than $c_1$ opponents.\nIf $s = \"11\\ldots1\"$, then $c_1 = n, c_0 = 0$.\nMin winning skill: $2^n$. Max winning skill: $2^n - 2^0 + 1 = 2^n$.\nSo if $s=\"11\\ldots1\"$, only $2^n$ can win.\nMy formula: $2^{c_1} = 2^n$. $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 2^n - 2^0 + 1 = 2^n - 1 + 1 = 2^n$. Range $[2^n, 2^n]$. This matches.\n\nIf $s = \"00\\ldots0\"$, then $c_1 = 0, c_0 = n$.\nMin winning skill: $2^{c_1} = 2^0 = 1$. Max winning skill: $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 2^n - 2^n + 1 = 1$.\nSo if $s=\"00\\ldots0\"$, only $1$ can win.\nMy formula: $2^{c_1} = 2^0 = 1$. $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 2^n - 2^n + 1 = 1$. Range $[1, 1]$. This matches.\n\nLet's try Example 2: $n=1, s=\"1\"$.\n$c_0=0, c_1=1$. $2^n=2$.\nMy formula: min $2^{c_1} = 2^1 = 2$. max $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 2 - 2^0 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$.\nRange $[2, 2]$. Output `2`. This matches.\n\nExample 3: $n=2, s=\"01\"$.\n$c_0=1, c_1=1$. $2^n=4$.\nMy formula: min $2^{c_1} = 2^1 = 2$. max $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 4 - 2^1 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3$.\nRange $[2, 3]$. Output `2 3`. This matches.\n\nThis formula seems correct. $min\\_skill = 2^{c_1}$ and $max\\_skill = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n\nWhy $2^{c_1}$?\nA team needs to win $c_1$ games by being the higher skill.\nTo do this, it needs to defeat $c_1$ opponents whose skills are smaller than $X$.\nThe smallest possible set of skills for $X$ to defeat are $1, 2, \\ldots, c_1$.\nBut this does not consider the tournament structure.\nThe $2^{c_1}$ factor suggests that $X$ must be able to defeat $2^{c_1}-1$ other teams, all of which are smaller than $X$, in a specific bracket structure.\nConsider the $c_1$ games where $X$ must be the higher skilled player.\nIn these games, $X$ will eliminate $c_1$ opponents.\nThese $c_1$ opponents must have skills smaller than $X$.\nThe total number of teams that $X$ has to beat or bypass to reach $X$'s level in these $c_1$ games is $2^{c_1}-1$.\nThis means $X$ must be able to be higher than all $2^{c_1}-1$ teams that are in its sub-bracket for these $c_1$ games.\nThe smallest possible value for $X$ to achieve this is $2^{c_1}$. If $X=2^{c_1}$, it can defeat $1, \\ldots, 2^{c_1}-1$.\nThis is effectively saying that $X$ must be able to win a sub-tournament of $2^{c_1}$ teams, all of which are smaller than $X$, using only the '1' rule. The smallest skill to win such a tournament is $2^{c_1}$.\n\nSimilarly, for $c_0$ games, $X$ must be the lower skilled player.\nIn these games, $X$ will eliminate $c_0$ opponents.\nThese $c_0$ opponents must have skills larger than $X$.\nThe total number of teams that $X$ has to beat or bypass to reach $X$'s level in these $c_0$ games is $2^{c_0}-1$.\nThis means $X$ must be able to be lower than all $2^{c_0}-1$ teams that are in its sub-bracket for these $c_0$ games.\nThe largest possible value for $X$ to achieve this is $2^n - (2^{c_0}-1) - 1 + 1 = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\nIf $X = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$, it can be smaller than $2^{c_0}-1$ opponents with skills $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 2, \\ldots, 2^n$.\nThis is effectively saying that $X$ must be able to win a sub-tournament of $2^{c_0}$ teams, all of which are larger than $X$, using only the '0' rule. The largest skill to win such a tournament is $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n\nThe two conditions are independent. $X$ must satisfy both.\nSo, the smallest possible skill $X$ can have is $2^{c_1}$.\nThe largest possible skill $X$ can have is $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\nAny integer $x$ in the range $[2^{c_1}, 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1]$ can be a winning skill.\nWe can always construct a permutation $p$ to make this happen. For a given $x$, we assign skills $1, \\ldots, 2^{c_1}-1$ to teams in $x$'s bracket such that $x$ defeats them when $s_i='1'$. We assign skills $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 2, \\ldots, 2^n$ to teams in $x$'s bracket such that $x$ defeats them when $s_i='0'$. The remaining skills can be filled arbitrarily.\n\nFinal check on constraints: $1 \\le n \\le 18$.\n$2^n$ can be up to $2^{18} = 262144$.\nThe number of winning integers can be up to $2^n$.\nPrinting them all in ascending order is required.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count $c_0$ (number of '0's in $s$) and $c_1$ (number of '1's in $s$).\n4. Calculate $min\\_winning\\_skill = 2^{c_1}$.\n5. Calculate $max\\_winning\\_skill = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n6. Iterate from $min\\_winning\\_skill$ to $max\\_winning\\_skill$ (inclusive) and print each number.\n\nExample 1: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$c_0=1, c_1=2$.\n$min\\_winning\\_skill = 2^2 = 4$.\n$max\\_winning\\_skill = 2^3 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\nOutput: $4, 5, 6, 7$.
