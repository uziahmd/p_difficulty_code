The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:** The problem is about minimizing time for Xenia to complete tasks on a ring road.  We're given the number of houses (`n`), tasks (`m`), and the task sequence (`a`).  Xenia starts at house 1 and moves clockwise.  Each move takes one unit of time. The core is calculating the time for a move from the current house to the target house.  If the target house is greater than or equal to the current, the time is simply the difference. If the target house is less than the current, we must account for the wrap-around, using the formula `(n - current_house) + target_house`. I keep track of the `current_house` and `total_time`. I iterate through the tasks, calculating the time for each move and updating `total_time` and `current_house`.  I tested it with the provided examples and some edge cases, like equal houses, increasing/decreasing sequences of houses.  I considered large inputs and the range of possible integer values, but Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle that easily. Finally, the implementation translates this logic directly into Python code, reading input, performing calculations, and printing the result. I am using `sys.stdin` for reading input efficiently as is common in competitive programming.\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current_house = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for target_house in a:\n        if target_house >= current_house:\n            time_taken = target_house - current_house\n        else:\n            time_taken = (n - current_house) + target_house\n        total_time += time_taken\n        current_house = target_house\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n```\n",
