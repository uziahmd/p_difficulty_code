There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out. We're looking at a knockout tennis tournament and trying to maximize the number of games the winner plays, but there's this tricky rule: players can only face each other if their game counts differ by at most one.\n\nMy approach involves figuring out the *minimum* number of players (`P_k`) needed to produce a winner who's played a certain number of games (`k`). The total number of games played is `n-1`.\n\nLet's trace:\n\n*   For `k = 1`, we need 2 players (one plays the other, winner has played 1). So `P_1 = 2`.\n*   For `k = 2`, we need a player who has already played one game and an opponent. The strategy should be to keep things minimal.\n\nThe core of my logic is building a recurrence relation.\n\n*   To have a winner who has played `k` games, they need to beat someone in their `k`-th game.\n*   That opponent must have a game count very close (max difference of one).\n*   To keep players to a minimum, the opponent should have as few games as possible.\n\nThis leads to: `P_k = P_(k-1) + P_(max(0, k-2))`. This works out to be `P_k = P_(k-1) + P_(k-2)`, with the base cases `P_0 = 1` and `P_1 = 2`.  (The starting player is 1.)\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence!  Or rather, a shifted version of it. The crucial insight is that `P_k` can be seen as the player count needed for the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8...) `f_(k+2)` such that `f_0=1` and `f_1=2`.\n\nSo, the problem boils down to finding the largest `k` such that this Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the total number of players `n`. We keep generating Fibonacci numbers and comparing them with `n`, stopping when we find one that's too big, then `k` is the number of games.\n\nFinally, the code will just generate Fibonacci numbers until one is greater than `n`. The largest `k` for which this condition holds is our answer. Simple!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a champion who has played `k` games. We want to find the maximum `k` such that `f(k) <= n`, where `n` is the total number of players.\n\nLet's analyze the recurrence for `f(k)`:\n- To play `k` games, a player (let's call them Player W) must have won `k-1` games and then won their `k`-th game.\n- Before the `k`-th game, Player W has played `k-1` games.\n- Player W's opponent (Player O) must have played `j` games such that `|(k-1) - j| <= 1`. This means `j` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\n- However, for Player W to win their `k`-th game, Player O must have played strictly fewer than `k` games. So `j` can be `max(0, k-2)` or `k-1`.\n- To minimize the total number of players `f(k)`, we should choose the opponent (Player O) who requires the minimum number of players to produce. This means we should choose `j` such that `f(j)` is minimized.\n\nLet's compute the first few values of `f(k)`:\n- `f(0)`: A player who hasn't played any games but is part of the tournament. This requires 1 player. So, `f(0) = 1`.\n- `f(1)`: The winner plays 1 game. Player W (0 games) plays Player X (0 games). W wins. W has 1 game. This requires `f(0)` for W and `f(0)` for X. So, `f(1) = f(0) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2`. This is valid since `|0-0|=0 <= 1`.\n- `f(2)`: The winner plays 2 games. Player W (1 game) needs an opponent O. `j` can be `max(0, 2-2)=0` or `2-1=1`.\n    - If O is a 0-winner: `f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`. (W beats X, W has 1 game. W plays Y (0 games), W wins. W has 2 games. Total 3 players).\n    - If O is a 1-winner: `f(2) = f(1) + f(1) = 2 + 2 = 4`. (W beats X, O beats Z. Both W and O have 1 game. W plays O, W wins. W has 2 games. Total 4 players).\n    To minimize `f(2)`, we choose the first option: `f(2) = 3`.\n\nIn general, to minimize `f(k)`, Player W (who has played `k-1` games) should play against an opponent O who has played `max(0, k-2)` games, because `f(max(0, k-2))` will be smaller than or equal to `f(k-1)` (the Fibonacci sequence is non-decreasing).\nSo, for `k >= 2`, the recurrence relation is `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)`.\n\nThis sequence `f(k)` is a Fibonacci-like sequence:\n`f(0) = 1`\n`f(1) = 2`\n`f(2) = 3` (`f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1`)\n`f(3) = 5` (`f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2`)\n`f(4) = 8` (`f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3`)\n...\n\nWe are given `n` players and want to find the maximum `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\nWe can generate this sequence iteratively until `f(k)` exceeds `n`.\n\nLet's trace with the given examples:\n- `n = 2`:\n    - `f(0) = 1 <= 2`. `k=0` is possible.\n    - `f(1) = 2 <= 2`. `k=1` is possible.\n    - `f(2) = 3 > 2`. `k=2` is not possible.\n    The maximum `k` is 1. Output: 1.\n- `n = 3`:\n    - `f(0) = 1 <= 3`. `k=0` possible.\n    - `f(1) = 2 <= 3`. `k=1` possible.\n    - `f(2) = 3 <= 3`. `k=2` possible.\n    - `f(3) = 5 > 3`. `k=3` not possible.\n    The maximum `k` is 2. Output: 2.\n- `n = 4`:\n    - `f(0) = 1 <= 4`. `k=0` possible.\n    - `f(1) = 2 <= 4`. `k=1` possible.\n    - `f(2) = 3 <= 4`. `k=2` possible.\n    - `f(3) = 5 > 4`. `k=3` not possible.\n    The maximum `k` is 2. Output: 2.\n- `n = 10`:\n    - `f(0) = 1 <= 10`. `k=0` possible.\n    - `f(1) = 2 <= 10`. `k=1` possible.\n    - `f(2) = 3 <= 10`. `k=2` possible.\n    - `f(3) = 5 <= 10`. `k=3` possible.\n    - `f(4) = 8 <= 10`. `k=4` possible.\n    - `f(5) = 13 > 10`. `k=5` not possible.\n    The maximum `k` is 4. Output: 4.\n\nThe results match the examples. The maximum value of `n` is `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so we only need to compute about 90 Fibonacci numbers to reach `10^18`. This is very efficient.\n\nThe algorithm:\n1. Initialize `f_prev = 1` (representing `f(0)`) and `f_curr = 2` (representing `f(1)`).\n2. Initialize `games_played = 0`.\n3. If `n` is 1, `games_played` remains 0. (Though problem constraints state `n >= 2`).\n4. Loop while `f_curr <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `next_f = f_prev + f_curr`.\n   b. Update `f_prev = f_curr`.\n   c. Update `f_curr = next_f`.\n   d. Increment `games_played` by 1.\n   (In each iteration, `games_played` corresponds to the `k` for which `f_prev` is `f(k)`.)\n5. Print `games_played`.\n\nLet's re-trace the loop with `f_prev` and `f_curr` representing `f(k-1)` and `f(k)` respectively, and `games_played` being `k`.\n\nInitial state:\n`f_prev = 1` (value of `f(0)`)\n`f_curr = 2` (value of `f(1)`)\n`games_played = 0` (current max games achieved, corresponding to `f_prev`)\n\nLoop for `n=2`:\n1. `f_curr (2) <= n (2)` is true.\n   `next_f = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n   `f_prev = 2`.\n   `f_curr = 3`.\n   `games_played = 1`.\n   (Now, `games_played=1` is achieved with `f_prev=2` players. `f_curr=3` is `f(2)`).\n2. `f_curr (3) <= n (2)` is false. Loop terminates.\nPrint `games_played` (which is 1). This is correct.\n\nThe logic is sound.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # f(k) = minimum players required for winner to play k games.\n    # f(0) = 1 (a player who hasn't played, but is in the pool)\n    # f(1) = 2 (winner plays 1 game, needs 2 players: P1(0) vs P2(0))\n    # f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) for k >= 2\n    # This is a Fibonacci-like sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...\n\n    # We want to find the largest k such that f(k) <= n.\n\n    # f_prev stores f(k-1), f_curr stores f(k)\n    f_prev = 1  # Corresponds to f(0)\n    f_curr = 2  # Corresponds to f(1)\n    \n    # games_played stores k.\n    # If n=1 (not possible by constraints, n >= 2), games_played would be 0.\n    # If n=2, f(1)=2, so games_played can be 1.\n    games_played = 0\n\n    # The loop condition checks if it's possible for the winner to play (games_played + 1) games.\n    # f_curr represents the minimum players needed for (games_played + 1) games.\n    # Example:\n    # Initially: f_prev=1 (f(0)), f_curr=2 (f(1)), games_played=0.\n    # Iter 1: Check if f(1) <= n.
