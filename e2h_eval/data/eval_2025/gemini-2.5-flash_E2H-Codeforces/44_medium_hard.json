He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process on solving \"Polycarp's Practice\":**\n\nOkay, I need to find a Python solution for this problem. Let's break it down. We're given `n` problems, `k` days, and an array `a` of difficulties. The goal is to divide the problems into `k` contiguous segments (days) and maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the maximum difficulties for each day.\n\nMy initial thought is that to maximize the total profit, I should try to make the maximum difficulties for each day as large as possible.  This naturally leads me to think about sorting.  If I sort the difficulties in descending order, the `k` largest values will be the ones I want. Can I guarantee that I can place these `k` largest elements as the maximum of *each* segment?\n\nYes! It seems I can.  The original indices matter. Let's say I choose the `k` largest elements. I sort the problems by decreasing difficulty and get their corresponding indices. These `k` indices will define the \"pivot points\" for the segment division. To maximize profits, all `k` largest values must be contained within *different* segments. Sort the `k` largest indices and cut at these indices. The sorted order of these indices within `a` determines how I divide the array into `k` segments.\n\nSo, the total profit will be the sum of these `k` largest elements. Now, I need to figure out the segment lengths (how many problems are in each segment).\n\nIf the k-largest indices are sorted and are `0,3,6`, the solution is 1+3+4 = 8\n\nFor segment length, the solution is at most  `[1,3,4]`. It does not matter as long as one of the problems of k-largest falls into a different segment.\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, input().split())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    # Sort the difficulties along with their indices\n    indexed_a = sorted([(val, i) for i, val in enumerate(a)], reverse=True)\n\n    # Take the k largest values and store their original indices\n    k_largest_indices = sorted([i for _, i in indexed_a[:k]])\n\n    # Calculate the total profit\n    total_profit = sum(val for val, _ in indexed_a[:k])\n\n    # Calculate segment lengths\n    segment_lengths = []\n    # The first segment goes from the start to the first cut point\n    segment_lengths.append(k_largest_indices[0] + 1)\n    # The middle segments go from cut point to cut point\n    for i in range(1, k - 1):\n        segment_lengths.append(k_largest_indices[i] - k_largest_indices[i - 1])\n    # The last segment goes from the last cut point to the end\n    segment_lengths.append(n - k_largest_indices[k - 2] - 1)\n\n    print(total_profit)\n    print(*segment_lengths)\n\nsolve()\n```",
    "response": "The problem asks us to divide `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous segments. Each segment represents problems solved on a day. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. We need to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output this maximum profit, along with the lengths of the `k` segments.\n\n**1. Maximizing Total Profit:**\n\nTo maximize the sum of `k` maximums, we should intuitively pick the `k` largest values from the entire list of problems `a`. Let these `k` largest values be `v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k`. The maximum possible total profit is `v_1 + v_2 + \\dots + v_k`.\n\nWhy is this true?\nConsider any valid distribution of problems into `k` days. Let the maximum difficulty for day `j` be `m_j`. The total profit for this distribution is `sum(m_j)`. Each `m_j` must be one of the `a_i` values. If we take the `k` largest values from the entire array `a`, say `v_1 \\ge v_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge v_k`, then `sum(m_j)` can be at most `sum(v_j)`. This is because if any `m_j` is not among the `k` largest values, then it must be smaller than or equal to `v_k`, and replacing it with one of the `v_j` values (if available) would increase or keep the sum the same. Since we can always construct a partition where the `k` largest values are the maximums of their respective days (as shown below), `sum(v_j)` is indeed the maximum possible profit.\n\n**2. Determining Segment Lengths:**\n\nOnce we have identified the `k` largest values, we need to find a way to partition the problems such that each of these `k` values becomes the maximum of one day's segment.\n\nLet's find the `k` largest values along with their original 0-based indices.\nExample: `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`, `n=8, k=3`.\nPairs of (value, index): `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`.\nSort these pairs by value in descending order and take the top `k`:\n`[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)]`.\nThe `k` largest values are `9, 6, 5`. Their sum is `20`, which is the maximum total profit.\n\nNow, collect their original 0-based indices: `[6, 3, 0]`.\nSort these indices in ascending order: `sorted_indices = [0, 3, 6]`.\nLet these sorted indices be `s_idx_0, s_idx_1, \\dots, s_idx_{k-1}`.\n\nWe can define the `k` segments using these `k` indices as \"pivot\" points. Each `s_idx_j` will be the last problem of a segment, except for the last `s_idx_{k-1}` which will be part of the final segment that extends to `n-1`.\nSpecifically, we make `k-1` cuts. The cut points will be right after `s_idx_0`, `s_idx_1`, ..., `s_idx_{k-2}`.\n\n*   Day 1: Problems from index `0` to `s_idx_0`.\n*   Day 2: Problems from index `s_idx_0 + 1` to `s_idx_1`.\n*   ...\n*   Day `j` (for `1 < j < k`): Problems from index `s_idx_{j-2} + 1` to `s_idx_{j-1}`.\n*   Day `k`: Problems from index `s_idx_{k-2} + 1` to `n-1`.\n\nLet's calculate the lengths `t_j`:\n*   `t_1 = (s_idx_0 - 0) + 1 = s_idx_0 + 1`\n*   `t_2 = (s_idx_1 - (s_idx_0 + 1)) + 1 = s_idx_1 - s_idx_0`\n*   ...\n*   `t_{k-1} = (s_idx_{k-2} - (s_idx_{k-3} + 1)) + 1 = s_idx_{k-2} - s_idx_{k-3}`\n*   `t_k = ((n-1) - (s_idx_{k-2} + 1)) + 1 = n - 1 - s_idx_{k-2} - 1 + 1 = n - s_idx_{k-2} - 1`\n\nLet's check this with the example: `s_idx = [0, 3, 6]`, `n=8, k=3`.\n`s_idx_0 = 0`, `s_idx_1 = 3`, `s_idx_2 = 6`. (Note: `s_idx_2` is not used as a cut point, it just falls into the last segment).\n*   `t_1 = s_idx_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n*   `t_2 = s_idx_1 - s_idx_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n*   `t_3 = n - (s_idx_1 + 1) = 8 - (3 + 1) = 4`. (Here, `s_idx_1` is `s_idx_{k-2}`).\n\nThe lengths are `[1, 3, 4]`.\nSegments: `[5]`, `[4, 2, 6]`, `[5, 1, 9, 2]`.\nMaximums: `5, 6, 9`. Total profit `20`.\nThis strategy works and provides a valid set of segment lengths. The problem allows any valid solution if multiple exist.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the array `a`.\n3.  Create a list of tuples `(value, original_index)` for each element in `a`.\n4.  Sort this list in descending order based on `value`.\n5.  Take the first `k` elements from the sorted list.\n6.  Sum their `value` components to get the `max_profit`.\n7.  Extract their `original_index` components into a new list.\n8.  Sort this list of indices in ascending order. Let it be `sorted_indices`.\n9.  Initialize an empty list `segment_lengths`.\n10. The first segment length is `sorted_indices[0] + 1`. Add this to `segment_lengths`.\n11. For `j` from `1` to `k-2`: The `j+1`-th segment length is `sorted_indices[j] - sorted_indices[j-1]`. Add this to `segment_lengths`.\n12. The last segment length is `n - (sorted_indices[k-2] + 1)`. Add this to `segment_lengths`.\n    *(Edge case: If `k=1`, there's only one segment of length `n`. The loop for `j` won't run. `sorted_indices` will have one element `s_idx_0`. `t_1 = s_idx_0 + 1` is not `n`. We need to handle `k=1` separately, or adjust the logic. If `k=1`, `sorted_indices` will have one element, say `s_idx_0`. The only segment is `[0...n-1]`, length `n`. The `k-2` index would be `-1`, which is problematic. A simpler approach for `segment_lengths`: store `0` as a virtual start index. Then `sorted_indices` are `[0, 3, 6]`. `segment_lengths` are `[s_idx_0+1, s_idx_1-s_idx_0, n-(s_idx_{k-2}+1)]`. This is correct for `k > 1`. For `k=1`, `sorted_indices` will contain just one index `s_idx_0`. The length is `n`.)*\n\nRevised segment length calculation (simpler for all `k`):\nStore the cut points. The cuts are made *after* `sorted_indices[0]`, `sorted_indices[1]`, ..., `sorted_indices[k-2]`.\n`cut_positions = sorted_indices[:k-1]` (these are 0-based indices).\nThe lengths are:\n`t_1 = cut_positions[0] + 1`\n`t_2 = cut_positions[1] - cut_positions[0]`\n...\n`t_{k-1} = cut_positions[k-2] - cut_positions[k-3]`\n`t_k = n - (cut_positions[k-2] + 1)` (This is `n` minus the start index of the last segment).\n\nTo generalize, create a list of all cut points: `[ -1 ] + sorted_indices[:k-1] + [ n-1 ]`.\nThen `t_j = (cut_points[j] - cut_points[j-1])`.\nLet's make `cut_points` be the *ending indices* of the first `k-1` segments.\n`cut_ends = sorted_indices[:k-1]`\n`current_start_idx = 0`\n`lengths = []`\n`for end_idx in cut_ends:`\n    `length = end_idx - current_start_idx + 1`\n    `lengths.append(length)`\n    `current_start_idx = end_idx + 1`\n`lengths.append(n - current_start_idx)` (This is the last segment)\n\nExample `n=8, k=3`, `sorted_indices = [0, 3, 6]`\n`cut_ends = [0, 3]`\n`current_start_idx = 0`\n1. `end_idx = 0`: `length = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1`. `lengths = [1]`. `current_start_idx = 1`.\n2. `end_idx = 3`: `length = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`. `lengths = [1, 3]`. `current_start_idx = 4`.\nAfter loop: `lengths.append(8 - 4) = 4`. `lengths = [1, 3, 4]`. This works for `k > 1`.\n\nFor `k=1`: `cut_ends` is empty. Loop doesn't run. `current_start_idx = 0`. `lengths.append(n - 0) = n`. Correct.\n\nThis generalized approach handles `k=1` correctly.\n\n**Constraints Check:**\n`n, k <= 2000`. Sorting `n` elements takes `O(N log N)`. Operations on `k` elements take `O(k log k)` (for sorting indices) or `O(k)`. This is efficient enough. `2000 log 2000` is roughly `2000 * 11 = 22000` operations, which is very fast.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Step 1: Create a list of (value, original_index) pairs\n    # Use 0-based indexing for original_index\n    indexed_problems = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        indexed_problems.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Step 2: Sort the list in descending order by value\n    # If values are equal, the order of indices doesn't matter for profit,\n    # but it might affect which specific index is chosen if there are duplicates.\n    # Python's sort is stable, which is fine.\n    indexed_problems.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n    # Step 3: Take the top k elements\n    top_k_problems = indexed_problems[:k]\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the maximum total profit\n    max_profit = sum(p[0] for p in top_k_problems)\n    print(max_profit)\n\n    # Step 5: Extract the original indices of these top k problems\n    # and sort them in ascending order.\n    top_k_indices = sorted([p[1] for p in top_k_problems])\n\n    # Step 6: Determine segment lengths\n    segment_lengths = []\n    \n    # The cut points are after the first k-1 chosen problems (in sorted index order).\n    # The last chosen problem falls into the k-th segment, which extends to the end of the list.\n    \n    current_start_idx = 0\n    # Iterate through the first k-1 sorted indices to determine cut points\n    for i in range(k - 1):\n        # The current segment ends at top_k_indices[i]\n        # Length is (end_index - start_index + 1)\n        length = top_k_indices[i] - current_start_idx + 1\n        segment_lengths.append(length)\n        # The next segment starts right after this one\n        current_start_idx = top_k_indices[i] + 1\n    \n    # The last segment covers the remaining problems\n    # from current_start_idx to n-1\n    last_segment_length = n - current_start_idx\n    segment_lengths.append(last_segment_length)\n\n    # Print the segment lengths\n    print(*(segment_lengths))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
