And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nOkay, so the problem's asking for the average sleep time over all possible \"weeks\" which are just consecutive `k` days. We have `n` sleep records, and we need to figure out the average.  First, I realized that calculating the sum for every single `k`-day window and then averaging them is the core idea. I sketched out how many windows there are (`n - k + 1`), then the sums, and finally the average.\n\nInitially, I thought a nested loop would do the trick, but that screams `O(n^2)` time, which is probably too slow for the problem's constraints (`n` up to 200,000).  We need to be cleverer.\n\nThat's when I remembered the *sliding window* technique. If we have the sum of one window, we can get the next one in constant time by subtracting the leftmost element and adding the new rightmost element.  Brilliant! This makes the whole algorithm `O(n)` which is much faster.\n\nNow, let's trace this out to be sure. With `n=8, k=2, a=[1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]`  I went through step-by-step to be sure the math and the sliding window method was producing the right sums in the right windows. After verifying, it seems to work.\n\nThe rest is just about details:  Make sure integer overflow doesn't rear its ugly head.  `a_i` is bounded, so it's `n * k * a_max`, which fits in even a 64-bit integer. Python's arbitrary size integers avoid these concerns anyway. I need to output a float with at least 6 digits after the decimal point so `float` will be appropriate. I used an `f-string` with `.10f` to keep output consistent with the examples and the problem constraints. I also need `import sys` for reading the input in a standard competitive programming style.\n\nI rechecked the examples to ensure the code worked correctly against them (and, importantly, that it *didn't* fail when `k=n` which I realized was another edge case). Alright, looks like a good, solid `O(n)` solution! I'm ready to write the code.\n",
