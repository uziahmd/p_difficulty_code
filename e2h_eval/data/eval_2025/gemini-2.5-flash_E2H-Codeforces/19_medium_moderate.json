The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Thought Process on \"The Number Games\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"The Number Games\" problem, and here's how I'm thinking it through.  The core is about a tree of districts where each contestant has a power of 2 fans. We have to ditch some contestants (k of them, to be exact) but the remaining ones must be a connected group to maximize the total fans.  Since the number of fans for each contestant is increasing with the district number (2 to the power of the district number), to maximize the sum, we need to try to keep those districts with *high* indices, essentially keeping the highest powers of two.\n\nThe first step is about problem rephrasing:  maximizing the fans is the same as maximizing the sum of the district numbers. So we are looking to find a connected subgraph of *n-k* nodes with the highest index sum.  This suggests we need to remove the *k* smallest index nodes to get the maximum sum.\n\nThe natural strategy is to be greedy!  We should start with the highest index district, and then keep adding neighbors with the highest indices until we have our connected component of *n-k* nodes. This feels like a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) on steroids, where the \"priority\" is the district number itself.  \n\nI can visualize this: let's pick the highest index node and then, to keep the highest indices in the sub-graph, always expand outward by picking the highest-indexed neighbors.  It's just like trying to build a really good team of contestants with the maximum number of fans.\n\nI'm starting to formalize a greedy approach. I think it looks like this:  \n1. Start with the highest indexed node.\n2. Visit neighbors of currently-kept nodes and add to the priority queue the highest index neighbors that are not in the visited nodes set.\n3. Add the nodes to a set until we hit the total amount of kept nodes, *n-k*\n4. Any node not in the final visited nodes set is the one to be removed\n\nThis seems like a solid plan. Now, to make sure it's optimal, I'm thinking about proving the greedy strategy correct. The key is in the \"connectivity\" aspect. Because the districts form a tree and we need a connected component, at each step we pick a node from the neighbors. It is crucial to prove that at any point during this \"greedy picking\", we are not potentially blocking another higher-index node from making a connection in the future. We can exchange argument on this - at any intermediate step we must pick the best locally-optimal choice and eventually get the globally optimal solution.\n\nThis greedy approach can be implemented using a priority queue (Python's `heapq` module) to efficiently select the highest-indexed unvisited neighbor at each step.  I need an adjacency list for the tree, and a set to keep track of the kept nodes. I need a visited set, and an adjacency list.  \n\nSo, I'm sketching out Python code. It's essentially a modified BFS, or a Dijkstra-like algorithm (since we are prioritizing based on district numbers, not the shortest path length). The core loop goes like this: extract the highest-indexed unvisited node, add it to the component, and push its unvisited neighbors to the queue.\n\nAfter that, the code will just iterate to find those nodes not marked as \"kept\" and output them. The time complexity seems to be dominated by the priority queue operations, which should be *O(n log n)* for a tree. Space complexity is O(N) for adjacency list, kept-nodes set and heap. It looks very efficient and should fit the problem constraints, especially since we iterate from the highest to the lowest index to create our result set of the \"to be removed\" districts. I'm double-checking the edge cases, but the approach looks to handle them just fine.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select `n - k` districts that form a connected component in the given tree structure, such that the sum of fan counts (`2^i` for district `i`) for these `n - k` districts is maximized. We then need to output the `k` districts that were *not* selected, in increasing order.\n\nSince `2^i` is a strictly increasing function of `i`, maximizing the sum of `2^i` is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the district numbers `i`. Therefore, our goal is to keep the `n - k` districts with the largest possible sum of their district numbers, while ensuring they remain connected.\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved using a greedy approach, similar to Prim's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree or Dijkstra's algorithm. We want to \"grow\" our connected component by always adding the unselected district that has the highest district number and is adjacent to an already selected district.\n\nHere's the detailed algorithm:\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Read `n` and `k`.\n    *   Create an adjacency list `adj` to represent the tree.\n    *   Initialize an empty set `kept_nodes` to store the districts we choose to keep.\n    *   Initialize a min-priority queue `pq`. We will store tuples `(-district_number, district_number)` in the priority queue. Using the negative of the district number allows `heapq` (a min-heap implementation) to effectively act as a max-heap, always returning the district with the largest number.\n\n2.  **Starting Point:**\n    *   To maximize the sum of district numbers, it's always optimal to include the district with the highest possible number if it can be part of a connected component of the desired size. We start by adding the district `n` (the highest possible district number) to our priority queue: `heapq.heappush(pq, (-n, n))`.\n\n3.  **Greedy Selection:**\n    *   We need to select `n - k` districts. Loop while `len(kept_nodes) < (n - k)`:\n        *   Extract the district `u` with the highest district number from `pq`. This is done using `heapq.heappop(pq)`.\n        *   If `u` is already in `kept_nodes` (this can happen if `u` was added to `pq` multiple times through different neighbors), skip it and continue to the next element in `pq`.\n        *   Add `u` to `kept_nodes`.\n        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u`:\n            *   If `v` is not yet in `kept_nodes`, add `(-v, v)` to `pq`. This makes `v` a candidate for future selection, ensuring connectivity.\n\n4.  **Identify Removed Districts:**\n    *   Once `n - k` districts have been added to `kept_nodes`, the loop terminates.\n    *   Iterate through all district numbers from `1` to `n`. If a district `i` is *not* in `kept_nodes`, it means it was removed. Add `i` to a list `removed_nodes`.\n    *   Since we iterate from `1` to `n`, `removed_nodes` will automatically be in increasing order.\n\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   Print the elements of `removed_nodes`, space-separated.\n\n**Why this greedy approach works:**\nAt each step, we have a connected component of selected districts. To maximize the sum of district numbers, we should always add the available district (i.e., a neighbor of the current component) with the highest district number. This local optimal choice leads to a global optimal solution because:\n*   The function `f(i) = 2^i` is strictly increasing, so maximizing `i` directly maximizes `2^i`.\n*   The connectivity constraint is maintained because we only add neighbors of already selected nodes.\n*   By always picking the highest-indexed available neighbor, we ensure that we are building the component with the largest possible sum of indices. If an optimal solution `S_opt` were to not include a node `u` that the greedy algorithm picks (and `u` has a higher index than some node `v` in `S_opt` but not `S_greedy`), we could potentially swap `u` for `v` to get a better or equally good solution while maintaining connectivity, contradicting `S_opt`'s optimality or showing `S_greedy` is also optimal.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** Building the adjacency list takes `O(N)` time. The main loop runs `N-K` times (number of nodes to keep). Each `heapq.heappop` and `heapq.heappush` operation takes `O(log P)` time, where `P` is the size of the priority queue. In the worst case, `P` can be `O(N)`. Each edge `(u, v)` causes `v` to be pushed when `u` is processed (if `v` is not kept), and `u` to be pushed when `v` is processed (if `u` is not kept). So, there are `O(N)` total push/pop operations. Thus, the greedy selection phase is `O(N log N)`. Identifying removed nodes is `O(N)`. Total time complexity: `O(N log N)`.\n*   **Space Complexity:** The adjacency list takes `O(N)` space. The `kept_nodes` set takes `O(N)` space. The priority queue takes `O(N)` space in the worst case. Total space complexity: `O(N)`.\n\nGiven `N <= 10^6`, an `O(N log N)` solution is efficient enough for competitive programming constraints.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    adj = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    kept_nodes = set()\n    # Priority queue stores (-district_number, district_number)\n    # Using negative district_number to simulate a max-heap with heapq (which is a min-heap)\n    pq = [] \n\n    # Start with the highest indexed node 'n'\n    # It must be part of the optimal connected component to maximize the sum of indices.\n    heapq.heappush(pq, (-n, n))\n\n    nodes_to_keep = n - k\n\n    while len(kept_nodes) < nodes_to_keep:\n        # If pq becomes empty before we select enough nodes, it implies an issue\n        # (e.g., graph not connected, or n-k is too large for a connected component).\n        # For this problem, graph is guaranteed connected and n-k >= 1.\n        if not pq: \n            break\n        \n        neg_idx, u = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        \n        if u in kept_nodes:\n            # This node was already processed and added to kept_nodes\n            # (e.g., pushed multiple times by different neighbors)\n            continue \n\n        kept_nodes.add(u)\n\n        # Add all unkept neighbors of u to the priority queue as candidates\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            if v not in kept_nodes:\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (-v, v))\n    \n    removed_nodes = []\n    # Iterate from 1 to n to get removed nodes in increasing order\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in kept_nodes:\n            removed_nodes.append(i)\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\" \".join(map(str, removed_nodes)) + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
