She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Browser\" Problem for a Python Script**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to solve this \"Browser\" problem. Let me break down my thought process. The core of it seems to involve optimizing tab closure within a browser-like interface.\n\nI have these inputs: `n` (total tabs), `pos` (current cursor), and `l`, `r` (range of tabs to keep). The goal is to minimize time (seconds) to end up with only tabs `[l, r]` open. The available actions are cursor movement (left/right) and closing tabs (left/right). The actions are subject to the current state of \"open\" tabs – represented by a range, currently `[a, b]`.\n\nInitially, everything's open, a range from 1 to n. The cursor can only move within the current *open* range, but only to *existing* tabs in that range. So, in the move operations `a` and `b` denote the current active range of tabs. The critical observation is that *a* and *b* are dynamic. They change as tabs get closed.\n\nThe key to optimization here is recognizing that I need to do two distinct closure operations:\n\n1.  Close tabs left of `l`: The cursor needs to be at `l` (or to its right), and then perform the \"close left\" action. This will make the new minimum unclosed tab index become `l`.\n\n2.  Close tabs right of `r`: The cursor needs to be at `r` (or to its left), and then perform the \"close right\" action. This will make the new maximum unclosed tab index become `r`.\n\nEffectively, I'm working with a sliding window of open tabs. The problem is to efficiently slide and \"shrink\" that window to land precisely on `[l, r]`.\n\nLet's quickly check the trivial case:\nIf the range to keep `[l, r]` is the entire range (`1, n`), no actions are needed. It's already done!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum time to close all tabs outside the range `[l, r]`. This means we need to perform two specific closing actions:\n1. Close all tabs `[1, l-1]`. This operation can only be done if the cursor is at tab `l` (or any tab `i > l`, and we close tabs `[1, i-1]`, effectively making `i` the new leftmost tab). The most efficient way to achieve this specific goal is to move the cursor to `l` and then perform a \"close left\" operation.\n2. Close all tabs `[r+1, n]`. This operation can only be done if the cursor is at tab `r` (or any tab `i < r`, and we close tabs `[i+1, n]`, effectively making `i` the new rightmost tab). The most efficient way to achieve this specific goal is to move the cursor to `r` and then perform a \"close right\" operation.\n\nLet's analyze the number of operations:\n\n**Edge Case 1: `l == 1` and `r == n`**\nIf `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, it means all tabs are already within the desired range `[1, n]`. No tabs need to be closed.\nTime = 0.\n\n**Edge Case 2: Only one side needs to be closed.**\n*   **`l == 1` (only tabs `[r+1, n]` need to be closed):**\n    The cursor needs to move from `pos` to `r`, then perform one \"close right\" operation.\n    Time = `abs(pos - r)` (moves) + 1 (close operation).\n*   **`r == n` (only tabs `[1, l-1]` need to be closed):**\n    The cursor needs to move from `pos` to `l`, then perform one \"close left\" operation.\n    Time = `abs(pos - l)` (moves) + 1 (close operation).\n\n**General Case: Both sides need to be closed (`l > 1` and `r < n`)**\nWe need to close tabs `[1, l-1]` and `[r+1, n]`. This requires two \"close\" operations. The cursor must visit `l` and `r` at some point.\n\nThere are two main strategies:\n1.  **Close left first, then close right:**\n    *   Move cursor from `pos` to `l`. This takes `abs(pos - l)` seconds.\n    *   Perform \"close left\" operation. This takes 1 second. Now tabs `[1, l-1]` are closed. The leftmost tab is `l`.\n    *   Move cursor from `l` to `r`. This takes `abs(l - r)` seconds.\n    *   Perform \"close right\" operation. This takes 1 second. Now tabs `[r+1, n]` are closed.\n    Total time = `abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1`.\n\n2.  **Close right first, then close left:**\n    *   Move cursor from `pos` to `r`. This takes `abs(pos - r)` seconds.\n    *   Perform \"close right\" operation. This takes 1 second. Now tabs `[r+1, n]` are closed. The rightmost tab is `r`.\n    *   Move cursor from `r` to `l`. This takes `abs(r - l)` seconds.\n    *   Perform \"close left\" operation. This takes 1 second. Now tabs `[1, l-1]` are closed.\n    Total time = `abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1`.\n\nWe need to choose the minimum of these two strategies.\n`min(abs(pos - l) + 1 + abs(l - r) + 1, abs(pos - r) + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1)`\n\nLet's consolidate these cases:\n\n*   **If `l == 1` and `r == n`:**\n    Result = 0\n*   **If `l == 1` (only close right side):**\n    Result = `abs(pos - r) + 1`\n*   **If `r == n` (only close left side):**\n    Result = `abs(pos - l) + 1`\n*   **If `l > 1` and `r < n` (close both sides):**\n    Result = `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2, abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2)`\n    Note that `abs(l - r)` is simply `r - l` since `l <= r`.\n\nLet's test with the examples:\n1.  `n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4`\n    `l > 1` and `r < n` (2 > 1, 4 < 6). Both sides need closing.\n    Strategy 1 (close left then right): `abs(3 - 2) + (4 - 2) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5`\n    Strategy 2 (close right then left): `abs(3 - 4) + (4 - 2) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5`\n    Minimum = 5. Correct.\n\n2.  `n=6, pos=3, l=1, r=3`\n    `l == 1` (only close right side).\n    Result = `abs(pos - r) + 1 = abs(3 - 3) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. Correct.\n\n3.  `n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5`\n    `l == 1` and `r == n`.\n    Result = 0. Correct.\n\nThis logic covers all cases and provides the minimum number of operations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        # All tabs are already within the desired range [1, n].\n        # No tabs need to be closed.\n        print(0)\n    elif l == 1:\n        # Only tabs to the right of r need to be closed.\n        # Move cursor from pos to r, then close right.\n        # Time = (moves from pos to r) + (1 for close operation)\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    elif r == n:\n        # Only tabs to the left of l need to be closed.\n        # Move cursor from pos to l, then close left.\n        # Time = (moves from pos to l) + (1 for close operation)\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    else:\n        # Both sides need to be closed.\n        # We need to visit both l and r.\n        # Two strategies:\n        # 1.
