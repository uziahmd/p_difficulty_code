Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Pythonic 'X' Checker**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with crafting a Python script to determine if an `n x n` grid of characters forms a stylized 'X'. The grid follows a specific pattern: both diagonals must contain the same letter, non-diagonal positions must share a different letter, and those two letter sets can't be equal.  The problem states that `n` will be odd and is greater than 2 and less than 300.\n\nFirst, I need to read the grid. I'll take `n` as input, and then read the grid line by line as a list of strings, calling it `paper`. I'll initialize two variables, `diag_char` and `other_char`, to `None`. I'll also set a flag `is_x` to `True`, assuming the grid *is* an 'X' initially.\n\nThe core logic revolves around iterating through the grid, row by row and column by column. For each cell, I'll check if its coordinates correspond to a diagonal position (either `r == c` or `r + c == n - 1`). If it's a diagonal element, and it's the first diagonal character I've encountered, I'll store it in `diag_char`. If a later diagonal character doesn't match `diag_char`, I'll immediately set `is_x` to `False` and stop the processing. Conversely, if the current cell isn't on a diagonal, and it's the first non-diagonal character, I'll store it in `other_char`. If any subsequent non-diagonal character mismatches `other_char`, `is_x` becomes `False` and I stop.\n\nI've got a little optimization trick here: if I find a mismatch, I `break` out of both inner and outer loops to end the iteration as fast as possible.\n\nOnce I've iterated through the grid, or if I've determined it's not an 'X', I have one final check. I need to make sure the diagonal character and non-diagonal character are *different*. If they are the same, `is_x` should be set to `False`.\n\nFinally, I just print \"YES\" if `is_x` is still `True`, or \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nI considered edge cases. Given that `n` is odd and greater than 2, I know there will always be diagonal and non-diagonal elements, so there's no way one character is 'None'. I also know the center cell will always belong to both diagonals. The code is written in a way to handle that naturally. I've walked through an example with `n=3` and it works correctly. I also checked with an `n=5` example where it should return \"NO\", which it did. The provided input format should be fine for my script to handle the problem. I'm using `sys.stdin.readline()` for optimal input reading.\n\nThe code seems solid, and I think it's efficient enough for the constraints of this problem!\n",
