His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Delving into Olympiad Ranking Strategies**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to figure out Vasya's best and worst possible ranks in this Olympiad. The crux of it is this: we've got scores from two rounds, no names attached, and we need to determine how to pair them up to get Vasya the best and worst placement.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand that the \"best rank\" means the *lowest* rank number (like 1st place). And the \"worst rank\" is the *highest* rank number. I see this is a combinatorial problem, a perfect matching scenario where each score from the first tour *must* be paired with a score from the second tour, and vice-versa. And, the total score needs to be at least `x`.\n\nTo find Vasya's *best* rank, I've got to maximize his total score while minimizing everyone else's. So, I need to figure out how to arrange the scores to give Vasya the highest possible total, and everyone else the lowest possible. Intuitively, I need to give him the biggest from round A and the biggest from round B, but the total score must be greater than or equal to x. To do that, I'm thinking of sorting the scores from both rounds A and B in ascending order. Then, I need to figure out how to assign scores to Vasya. The problem guarantees there is at least one pairing that will achieve the x target score for Vasya. So I should be able to figure out how to maximize his scores, without the total score being less than x.\n\nFor the *worst* rank, it's the opposite: I've got to minimize Vasya's score (while still keeping it at or above `x`) and maximize everyone else's. So, I need to find the lowest possible total score Vasya can achieve, given the constraint, and distribute the remaining scores in a way that pushes him down the rankings.\n\nThe core of both strategies is this: sort the scores, and then strategize the pairing to create the desired outcome (best or worst case). It is about building a mental model of the rankings from the scores and applying optimization principles. Let's see how this plays out in the code...\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the best (lowest numerical value) and worst (highest numerical value) possible ranks Vasya could achieve. The key difficulty is that we don't know which first-tour score `a_i` belongs to which second-tour score `b_j`. We must form `n` pairs `(a_i, b_j)` using each score exactly once. Vasya is one of these `n` participants, and his total score is guaranteed to be at least `x`.\n\nLet's denote the sorted arrays of scores as `A` (first tour) and `B` (second tour).\n`A = sorted(a)`\n`B = sorted(b)`\n\n**1. Finding the Best Possible Rank for Vasya**\n\nTo achieve the best rank (rank 1), Vasya needs to maximize his own score and/or minimize the scores of other participants. If Vasya can achieve a score `S_Vasya` such that no other participant can achieve a score greater than `S_Vasya`, then Vasya can be ranked 1st. If multiple participants achieve the same top score, Vasya can still be ranked 1st due to the jury's decision.\n\nThe best strategy for Vasya to get rank 1 is to maximize his score. To do this, he should take the highest possible `a_i` and the highest possible `b_j` that are still available.\nSpecifically, if we pair the largest `a_i` with the largest `b_j`, the second largest `a_i` with the second largest `b_j`, and so on, this pairing (often called \"greedy pairing\" or \"sorted pairing\") maximizes the sum of pairs. This is not what we want.\nTo maximize Vasya's score, he should take the largest `a_i` and largest `b_j` from the available scores. Let's say `a_n` is the largest score in `A` and `b_n` is the largest score in `B`. Vasya can potentially get `a_n + b_n`. This is the absolute maximum possible score any participant can get. If `a_n + b_n >= x`, then Vasya can achieve this score and guarantee himself the 1st place.\n\nSo, the best rank is always 1. The problem guarantees that \"there are two integers `i, j` (1 <= i, j <= n) such, that `a_i + b_j >= x`\". This implies Vasya can always achieve a score of at least `x`. By choosing the highest available `a_i` and `b_j`, Vasya can achieve `max(A) + max(B)`. Since this is the highest possible score any participant can get, and Vasya can take it (as long as it's >= x, which is true because the problem guarantees at least *some* pair satisfies `a_i + b_j >= x`, and `max(A)+max(B)` is the largest possible sum), he can be ranked 1st.\n\n**2. Finding the Worst Possible Rank for Vasya**\n\nTo find the worst rank, we need to:\n1.  Minimize Vasya's score, while ensuring it's at least `x`.\n2.  Maximize the scores of other participants relative to Vasya's score.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding a pairing of `A` and `B` such that Vasya's score `S_Vasya` is minimized (but >= `x`), and the number of participants with scores strictly greater than `S_Vasya` is maximized. If there are participants with scores equal to `S_Vasya`, Vasya can be placed after all of them.\n\nConsider the participants' scores. We want to find a pairing `(a_i, b_j)` for each participant.\nLet's sort `A` in ascending order and `B` in ascending order.\n`A = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`\n`B = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]`\n\nTo maximize the scores of other participants relative to Vasya, we should try to form as many high-scoring pairs as possible for *other* participants.\nThe most effective way to create high scores is to pair large `a_i` with large `b_j`.\nThe most effective way to create low scores is to pair small `a_i` with small `b_j`.\n\nLet's try to pair `a_i` with `b_{n-i+1}` (i.e., `a_1` with `b_n`, `a_2` with `b_{n-1}`, etc.). This pairing strategy (pairing the smallest with the largest, second smallest with second largest, etc.) tends to equalize the sums, or at least keep them from being too extreme.\n\nHowever, a different strategy is more relevant for maximizing other people's scores:\nWe want to find a permutation `p` of `B` such that `a_i + b_{p[i]}` forms the `n` scores.\nTo maximize the number of participants who score better than Vasya, we should try to match `a_i` with `b_j` such that many pairs `a_k + b_l` are large, and Vasya's score `a_v + b_w` is small (but >= `x`).\n\nThis problem can be modeled as finding the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nLet's iterate through each `a_i` in sorted `A`. For a given `a_i`, we want to find a `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`, or `b_j >= x - a_i`.\nTo maximize the number of such pairs, we can use a greedy approach.\nSort `A` in ascending order. Sort `B` in ascending order.\nWe want to count how many participants can achieve a score of at least `x`.\nLet's try to pair the smallest `a_i` with the largest `b_j` that satisfies `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nThis is a standard two-pointer approach for finding the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` where `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n\nAlgorithm for worst rank:\n1.  Sort `A` and `B` in ascending order.\n2.  Initialize `count = 0` (this will be the number of participants whose score can be made >= `x`).\n3.  Use two pointers: `ptr_a` starting at `0` (for `A`) and `ptr_b` starting at `n-1` (for `B`).\n4.  While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n    a.  If `A[ptr_a] + B[ptr_b] >= x`:\n        This pair `(A[ptr_a], B[ptr_b])` can form a score of at least `x`. We \"use\" these two scores. Increment `count`, move `ptr_a` forward (`ptr_a += 1`), and move `ptr_b` backward (`ptr_b -= 1`).\n    b.  Else (`A[ptr_a] + B[ptr_b] < x`):\n        The current `A[ptr_a]` is too small to combine with `B[ptr_b]` to reach `x`. Since `B` is sorted ascending, `B[ptr_b]` is the largest available `b` score for `A[ptr_a]`. If even the largest `b` cannot help `A[ptr_a]` reach `x`, then `A[ptr_a]` cannot be part of any pair that sums to `x` using remaining `b`s. So, `A[ptr_a]` must be paired with some other `b` (which will result in a sum less than `x`). We effectively discard `A[ptr_a]` from consideration for forming an `x`-sum pair and move to the next `a` score: `ptr_a += 1`.\n        *Correction*: This step is slightly off. If `A[ptr_a] + B[ptr_b] < x`, it means `A[ptr_a]` is too small to combine with `B[ptr_b]` to reach `x`. We cannot simply discard `A[ptr_a]`. Instead, `B[ptr_b]` is a large score. If it cannot help `A[ptr_a]` reach `x`, it means `A[ptr_a]` is \"very small\". We should try to pair `A[ptr_a]` with a smaller `B` value to save `B[ptr_b]` for a larger `A` value.\n        The correct greedy strategy for maximizing pairs `a_i + b_j >= x` is:\n        Sort `A` ascending. Sort `B` ascending.\n        Use two pointers, `i` for `A` starting at `0`, and `j` for `B` starting at `n-1`.\n        `count = 0`\n        While `i < n` and `j >= 0`:\n            If `A[i] + B[j] >= x`:\n                We found a pair that sums to at least `x`. Increment `count`. Move `i` forward (`i += 1`) and `j` backward (`j -= 1`).\n            Else (`A[i] + B[j] < x`):\n                `A[i]` is too small to reach `x` even with the largest available `B[j]`. This means `A[i]` *cannot* be part of any pair that sums to `x` with any of the remaining `B` scores (since all remaining `B` scores are smaller than or equal to `B[j]`). So, `A[i]` will definitely form a pair with sum less than `x`. We move `i` forward (`i += 1`) to consider the next `a` score. The `B[j]` is still available.\n        This `count` represents the maximum number of participants who *can* achieve a score of at least `x`.\n        This is exactly the worst rank for Vasya. If `k` participants can score at least `x`, Vasya could be one of them and be ranked last among them. So his worst rank is `k`.\n\nLet's re-verify the worst rank logic. The problem states: \"If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice.\" This means if `k` participants score `S_max`, Vasya could be 1st or `k`th among them.\nTo get the worst rank, Vasya wants to be beaten by as many people as possible.\nSo, we want to maximize the number of people who score `S_other > S_Vasya`.\nIf we can make `k` people score `S_k >= x` and `n-k` people score `S_n-k < x`, then Vasya could be one of the `k` people who score `S_k >= x`. In the worst case, all `k-1` other people who scored `S_k >= x` are ranked above him, and he is ranked `k`.\n\nThe algorithm described above correctly finds the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. Let this count be `k`.\nThis `k` is the maximum number of participants who can achieve a score of at least `x`.\nVasya is one of these participants. In the worst-case scenario, the jury places him last among these `k` participants. So, his worst rank is `k`.\n\nExample 2:\nn=6, x=7\na = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4] -> sorted A = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]\nb = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4] -> sorted B = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]\n\nWorst rank calculation:\nA = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]\nB = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]\nptr_a = 0, ptr_b = 5, count = 0\n\n1. `A[0]=3`, `B[5]=8`. `3+8=11 >= 7`. Yes. `count=1`. `ptr_a=1`, `ptr_b=4`.\n2. `A[1]=4`, `B[4]=6`. `4+6=10 >= 7`. Yes. `count=2`. `ptr_a=2`, `ptr_b=3`.\n3. `A[2]=4`, `B[3]=4`. `4+4=8 >= 7`. Yes. `count=3`. `ptr_a=3`, `ptr_b=2`.\n4. `A[3]=4`, `B[2]=4`. `4+4=8 >= 7`. Yes. `count=4`. `ptr_a=4`, `ptr_b=1`.\n5. `A[4]=5`, `B[1]=3`. `5+3=8 >= 7`. Yes. `count=5`. `ptr_a=5`, `ptr_b=0`.\n6. `A[5]=6`, `B[0]=0`. `6+0=6 < 7`. No. `ptr_a=6`.\nLoop ends because `ptr_a = 6` (which is `n`).\n\nThe maximum number of participants who can score at least `x` is 5. So, Vasya's worst rank is 5.\nThis matches the example output.\n\nFinal logic:\nBest rank: 1 (always, due to jury choice and problem guarantee)\nWorst rank: `k`, where `k` is the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\n\nThis approach is efficient: sorting takes O(N log N), and the two-pointer scan takes O(N).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Best rank is always 1.\n    # Vasya can achieve a score of max(a) + max(b).\n    # Since the problem guarantees that at least one pair (a_i, b_j) sums to >= x,\n    # Vasya can always achieve a score of at least x.\n    # By taking the highest possible scores (max(a) and max(b)),\n    # Vasya can achieve the absolute highest possible total score.\n    # If multiple participants get the same highest score, the jury can assign Vasya 1st place.\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    # Worst rank calculation\n    # We want to find the maximum number of participants (including Vasya)\n    # who can achieve a total score of at least x.\n    # Vasya's worst rank will be this count, as he could be placed last among them.\n\n    # Sort both arrays to apply the two-pointer technique\n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n\n    count_at_least_x = 0\n    ptr_a = 0  # Pointer for the smallest available score in array a\n    ptr_b = n - 1 # Pointer for the largest available score in array b\n\n    while ptr_a < n and ptr_b >= 0:\n        if a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x:\n            # This pair (a[ptr_a], b[ptr_b]) can achieve a score of at least x.\n            # We \"use\" these scores and increment the count.\n            count_at_least_x += 1\n            ptr_a += 1 # Move to the next smallest a score\n            ptr_b -= 1 # Move to the next largest b score\n        else:\n            # a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x.\n            # Since b is sorted ascending, b[ptr_b] is the largest available b score.\n            # If even the largest available b score cannot help a[ptr_a] reach x,\n            # then a[ptr_a] cannot be paired with any remaining b score to reach x.\n            # So, a[ptr_a] must be paired with some b to form a sum less than x.\n            # We move on to the next smallest a score, effectively \"discarding\" a[ptr_a]\n            # from forming a sum >= x.\n            ptr_a += 1\n            # Note: b[ptr_b] is still available for a larger a[ptr_a']\n\n    worst_rank = count_at_least_x\n\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"{best_rank} {worst_rank}\\n\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
