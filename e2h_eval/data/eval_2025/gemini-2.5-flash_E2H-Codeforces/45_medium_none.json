There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**The Tennis Championship: My Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with figuring out the maximum number of games a winner can play in this knockout tennis tournament. The crucial rule is that players can only face each other if their game counts differ by at most one, and they must have won all their prior games. My thought process went like this:\n\nFirst, I realized I needed a way to track the minimum number of players needed to produce a winner who has played a certain number of games. I defined this as `dp[k]`, where `k` is the number of games the winner has played. I know that `dp[0]` is simply 1 (a single player), and `dp[1]` is 2 (two players to have a winner of 1 game).\n\nTo move forward, I examined the winning player's journey. When they play their `i`-th game, their opponent's game count must be either `i-1` or `i-2`. That's due to the rule of the difference being at most 1. This crucial observation led to this recursion: to have a player win `k` games, I need either two winners of `k-1` games to compete or a winner of `k-1` and a winner of `k-2` to meet. That gives me `dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2]`. The minimum players needed to make a `k`-game winner.\n\nThis recursion, with the base cases, pointed me toward the Fibonacci sequence, shifted by two: `dp[k] = fib(k+2)`. I started to build the fibonacci sequence but since the input `n` could be large (up to 10^18), I knew I couldn't compute the entire sequence. Instead, I worked on finding the largest `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`.\n\nTo do this efficiently, I realized that I didn't need to actually *store* all the Fibonacci numbers. I could simply calculate them on the fly. I used two variables, `a` and `b`, to represent the current and next Fibonacci numbers, and kept looping as long as `a` was less than or equal to `n`. In each iteration, I updated `a` and `b` to the next pair of Fibonacci numbers, and incremented the game count. When `a` exceeded `n`, I knew the previous `k`, which I'd been tracking, was my answer. I printed `k-1` because at that point `k` had exceeded the max game capacity. This loop runs efficiently and allows large values of n to be handled because the Fibonacci numbers increase logarithmically, making the time complexity O(log n).\n\nMy Python code efficiently executes this process. The program inputs a single integer `n` from standard input, initialized the fibonacci numbers, finds `k`, and prints `k-1` to standard output.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a tennis tournament can play, given `n` participants and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games to continue.\n\nLet `k` be the number of games the winner plays. We want to find the maximum `k` such that it's possible for a winner to play `k` games with `n` initial players, respecting the rule. To maximize `k` for a given `n`, we should try to minimize the number of players required for a winner to play `k` games.\n\nLet `dp[g]` be the minimum number of initial players required to produce a winner who has played `g` games.\n\n1.  **Base Case `g=0`**: A player who has played 0 games is an initial participant. So, `dp[0] = 1`.\n2.  **Base Case `g=1`**: To win 1 game, a player (who has played 0 games) must play against another player (who has also played 0 games). This requires 2 initial players. So, `dp[1] = 2`.\n\n3.  **Recursive Step for `g > 1`**:\n    Consider a player who has won `g-1` games and is about to play their `g`-th game. Their opponent must have played `g_O` games such that `| (g-1) - g_O | <= 1`.\n    Since the opponent must also be a winner of `g_O` games to reach this point, `g_O` cannot be `g` (as that would imply the opponent has won as many games as the current winner-to-be, and they are about to play each other, meaning one of them must have played fewer games to be \"behind\" in the bracket structure or they came from sub-tournaments that produced winners of `g-1` games).\n    So, `g_O` can be `g-1` or `g-2`.\n\n    *   **Option 1: Opponent played `g-1` games.**\n        The winner (who has `g-1` games) plays against an opponent (who has `g-1` games).\n        To produce the winner (who has `g-1` games), we need `dp[g-1]` initial players.\n        To produce the opponent (who has `g-1` games), we also need `dp[g-1]` initial players.\n        Total players required for this scenario: `dp[g-1] + dp[g-1] = 2 * dp[g-1]`.\n\n    *   **Option 2: Opponent played `g-2` games.**\n        The winner (who has `g-1` games) plays against an opponent (who has `g-2` games).\n        To produce the winner (who has `g-1` games), we need `dp[g-1]` initial players.\n        To produce the opponent (who has `g-2` games), we need `dp[g-2]` initial players.\n        Total players required for this scenario: `dp[g-1] + dp[g-2]`.\n\n    Since we want the *minimum* number of players, `dp[g]` will be the minimum of these two options:\n    `dp[g] = min(2 * dp[g-1], dp[g-1] + dp[g-2])`.\n    Given that `dp` values are positive and increasing (`dp[g-2] < dp[g-1]`), `dp[g-1] + dp[g-2]` will always be less than `2 * dp[g-1]`.\n    Therefore, `dp[g] = dp[g-1] + dp[g-2]` for `g >= 2`.\n\nThis recurrence relation `dp[g] = dp[g-1] + dp[g-2]` with base cases `dp[0]=1` and `dp[1]=2` generates a sequence that is a shifted Fibonacci sequence.\nLet the standard Fibonacci sequence be `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, ...`\nThen `dp[g]` corresponds to `F_{g+2}`:\n`dp[0] = F_2 = 1`\n`dp[1] = F_3 = 2`\n`dp[2] = F_4 = 3`\n`dp[3] = F_5 = 5`\n... and so on.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum `k` such that `dp[k] <= n`. We can find this by iteratively calculating Fibonacci numbers (starting from `F_2` and `F_3`) and counting how many games (`k`) they correspond to, until the required number of players exceeds `n`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `a = 1` (representing `dp[0]`, which is `F_2`)\n2.  Initialize `b = 2` (representing `dp[1]`, which is `F_3`)\n3.  Initialize `k_games = 0` (representing the number of games for `a`)\n4.  Loop while `a <= n`:\n    a.  Update `a` and `b` to the next Fibonacci numbers: `a, b = b, a + b`.\n    b.  Increment `k_games` by 1.\n5.  When the loop terminates, `a` is the first `dp` value that is greater than `n`. The `k_games` variable at this point corresponds to this `a`. Therefore, the maximum number of games the winner can play is `k_games - 1`.\n\n**Example `n=10`:**\n-   `a=1, b=2, k_games=0`\n-   `1 <= 10`: `a=2, b=3, k_games=1`\n-   `2 <= 10`: `a=3, b=5, k_games=2`\n-   `3 <= 10`: `a=5, b=8, k_games=3`\n-   `5 <= 10`: `a=8, b=13, k_games=4`\n-   `8 <= 10`: `a=13, b=21, k_games=5`\n-   `13 > 10`: Loop terminates.\n-   Result: `k_games - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n\nThis approach is efficient because Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. For `n` up to `10^18`, `k_games` will be at most around 88 (since `F_88` is approximately `1.1 * 10^18`). Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle large numbers automatically.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # dp[k] represents the minimum number of initial players required\n    # for a winner to play k games.\n    # The sequence is:\n    # dp[0] = 1 (1 player, 0 games played)\n    # dp[1] = 2 (2 players, winner plays 1 game)\n    # dp[k] = dp[k-1] + dp[k-2] for k >= 2\n    # This sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...) corresponds to Fibonacci numbers F_{k+2}\n    # where standard Fibonacci sequence is F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, ...\n\n    # We are looking for the maximum k such that dp[k] <= n.\n\n    # 'a' will store dp[current_k]\n    # 'b' will store dp[current_k + 1]\n    # 'k_games' will store the current k for 'a'.\n    a = 1  # dp[0]\n    b = 2  # dp[1]\n    k_games = 0 # Corresponds to 'a' being dp[0]\n\n    # Iterate, generating Fibonacci numbers (dp values)\n    # and incrementing k_games, until dp[k_games] exceeds n.\n    while a <= n:\n        # Move to the next pair in the Fibonacci sequence\n        # The new 'a' becomes the old 'b' (dp[k_games + 1])\n        # The new 'b' becomes the sum (dp[k_games + 2])\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k_games += 1 # Increment k_games, as 'a' now represents dp[k_games]\n\n    # When the loop finishes, 'a' is the first dp value that is greater than n.\n    # This means the previous value of k_games (k_games - 1) was the maximum\n    # number of games for which dp[k_games - 1] was less than or equal to n.\n    print(k_games - 1)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
