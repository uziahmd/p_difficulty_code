    "thought": "**Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Ternary String**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this problem of finding the smallest ternary string given these swap rules: '01' can flip with '10', and '12' can flip with '21'.  I'm thinking about how these swaps affect the overall order. It's pretty clear that a '0' can move past a '1' (and vice versa) and a '1' can move past a '2' (and vice versa).  But what about '0's and '2's? Can they effectively swap positions?\n\nI started sketching out a few examples. If I have \"02\", I can't directly swap them. To move the '0' past the '2', I'd need a '1' in the mix, like in \"012\". I tried some manipulations, but it seems like a '0' will *always* stay to the left of a '2', no matter how many '1's are floating around in between.\n\nI needed to formalize this, so I'm thinking about inversions. If I have a '0' at index *i* and a '2' at index *j* where *i* < *j*, that's an \"ordered\" pair. Can the swaps create an \"inverted\" pair (where *i* > *j*)? The only swaps are '01' <-> '10' and '12' <-> '21'. Looking at these swaps, I realized a '0' only interacts with a '1', and a '2' only interacts with a '1'.  This is key! The relative order of '0's and '2's is invariant under these swaps.  No matter what I do with the '1's, the '0's and '2's will maintain their initial relative order.  This is going to be incredibly useful when I write the algorithm!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string by swapping adjacent '0' and '1' characters, or adjacent '1' and '2' characters. We cannot directly swap '0' and '2'.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1. '01' <-> '10': A '0' can move past a '1' (and vice versa).\n2. '12' <-> '21': A '1' can move past a '2' (and vice versa).\n\nConsider what these operations imply about the relative order of characters:\n- **'0' and '1'**: Their relative order can be changed. A '0' can move to the left of any '1', and a '1' can move to the left of any '0'. This means all '0's and '1's can be rearranged among themselves.\n- **'1' and '2'**: Their relative order can be changed. A '1' can move to the left of any '2', and a '2' can move to the left of any '1'. This means all '1's and '2's can be rearranged among themselves.\n- **'0' and '2'**: A '0' cannot directly swap with a '2'. Can they swap indirectly?\n    Suppose we have \"0...2\". To move '0' past '2', the '0' would have to move to the right of '2'.\n    A '0' can only move by swapping with a '1'. So, if '0' moves right, it must swap '01' -> '10'.\n    A '2' can only move by swapping with a '1'. So, if '2' moves left, it must swap '12' -> '21'.\n    Neither of these operations changes the relative order of a '0' and a '2'. For example, if we have '0...1...2', swapping '0' and '1' gives '1...0...2'. The '0' is still to the left of '2'. Swapping '1' and '2' gives '0...2...1'. The '0' is still to the left of '2'.\n    This means the relative order of '0's and '2's is invariant. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it must appear before that same '2' in any reachable string.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string:\nWe want to place as many '0's as possible at the beginning of the string.\nSince '0's cannot move past '2's, any '0' that appears after a '2' in the original string will always remain after that '2'.\nTherefore, all '0's that appear *before* any '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning of the string. All '0's that appear *after* a '2' can be moved to the left as much as possible, but not past any '2' that was originally to their left.\nHowever, a simpler observation is that all '0's can be moved to the left of all '1's. All '2's can be moved to the right of all '1's.\nThe critical invariant is that the relative order of '0's and '2's cannot change. This means if we have `s_i = '0'` and `s_j = '2'` with `i < j`, then in any reachable string `s'_k = '0'` and `s'_l = '2'` that correspond to the original characters, we must have `k < l`.\n\nThis implies that all '0's must appear before all '2's *that they originally preceded*.\nEffectively, all '0's can be grouped together. All '2's can be grouped together. All '1's can be grouped together.\nThe relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\nConsider the string without '1's. For example, if the original string is \"100210\", the '0's and '2's are \"0020\". The '0's at index 1 and 2 are before the '2' at index 3. The '0' at index 5 is after the '2' at index 3.\nThe '0's that appear *before* any '2' in the original string can be moved to the beginning.\nThe '2's can only be moved to the right of '1's.\nThe '1's can be moved around '0's and '2's.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the invariant: The relative order of any '0' and any '2' is fixed.\nThis means all '0's that appear before *any* '2' in the original string must appear before *that same* '2' in the final string.\nMore strongly, if we have a sequence of '0's and '2's like `...0...2...0...2...`, this relative ordering is preserved.\nThe '1's are \"bridges\" that allow '0's to move left past them and '2's to move right past them.\nThis means all '0's can be moved to the very beginning of the string, *except* if they are blocked by a '2'.\nBut since '0's cannot move past '2's, any '0' that is to the right of a '2' will remain to the right of that '2'.\nAnd any '2' that is to the left of a '0' will remain to the left of that '0'.\n\nThe key insight is that all '1's can be moved past any '0' (to its right) and past any '2' (to its left). This means all '1's can be collected together into one contiguous block.\nWhere should this block of '1's be placed to get the lexicographically smallest string?\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to put as many '0's as possible at the beginning.\nAll '0's can move to the left of all '1's.\nAll '2's can move to the right of all '1's.\nSo, we can arrange all '0's, then all '1's, then all '2's. This forms a string `00...011...122...2`.\nHowever, this is only possible if there are no '2's before '0's in the original string.\nSince the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed, we cannot change a \"20\" subsequence to \"02\".\nTherefore, any '0' must stay to the left of any '2' that it was originally to the left of.\nAnd any '2' must stay to the right of any '0' that it was originally to the right of.\n\nThis means the '0's and '2's maintain their relative order.\nThe '1's are completely \"mobile\" with respect to '0's and '2's. They can move past '0's and '2's.\nTherefore, all '1's can be collected and placed anywhere among the '0's and '2's.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest:\n1. We want to put all '0's first.\n2. Then, we want to put '1's.\n3. Then, '2's.\n\nSince '0's and '2's cannot change their relative order, we should construct the string of '0's and '2's first, by keeping their original relative order.\nExample: \"100210\"\n'0's and '2's: \"0020\"\nCount of '1's: 2\nThe '0's and '2's form the \"backbone\" of the string.\nThe '1's can be placed anywhere relative to this backbone.\nTo minimize lexicographically, all '1's should be placed *after* all '0's and *before* all '2's.\nMore precisely, all '1's should be placed *after* the initial block of '0's and *before* the first '2'.\nSo, the structure will be: `(all 0s) (all 1s) (remaining 0s and 2s in their original relative order)`.\nNo, this is not quite right.\nThe '1's can be moved past any '0' or any '2'. This means all '1's can be grouped together.\nWhere should this group of '1's be placed?\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to have '0's first.\nSo, all '0's that appear before the *first* '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning.\nThen, all '1's can be moved to appear after these initial '0's.\nThen, the remaining '2's and any '0's that were originally after the first '2' will follow, maintaining their relative order.\n\nLet's try this strategy:\n1. Extract all '1's from the string. Count them. Let this count be `num_ones`.\n2. Form a new string `s_prime` by concatenating all '0's and '2's from the original string, maintaining their relative order.\n   Example: \"100210\" -> `num_ones = 2`, `s_prime = \"0020\"`\n   Example: \"11222121\" -> `num_ones = 4`, `s_prime = \"2222\"`\n   Example: \"20\" -> `num_ones = 0`, `s_prime = \"20\"`\n3. Now, we need to insert the `num_ones` '1's into `s_prime`. Where should they go to make the result lexicographically smallest?\n   We want to place '0's as early as possible. So, all '1's should be placed after all '0's that come before any '2'.\n   This means we should find the first '2' in `s_prime`.\n   - If `s_prime` contains no '2's (e.g., \"000\"), then all '1's should go after all '0's. Result: \"00011\".\n   - If `s_prime` contains '2's (e.g., \"0020\"):\n     All '0's before the first '2' should come first.\n     Then all '1's.\n     Then the rest of `s_prime` (from the first '2' onwards).\n     So, find the index of the first '2' in `s_prime`. Let it be `first_two_idx`.\n     The result will be `s_prime[0:first_two_idx]` + `num_ones * '1'` + `s_prime[first_two_idx:]`.\n\nLet's test this strategy:\nInput: \"100210\"\n1. `num_ones = 2`.\n2. `s_prime = \"0020\"`.\n3. First '2' in `s_prime` is at index 2. `first_two_idx = 2`.\n   `s_prime[0:2]` is \"00\".\n   `num_ones * '1'` is \"11\".\n   `s_prime[2:]` is \"20\".\n   Result: \"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\" = \"001120\". This matches the example output.\n\nInput: \"11222121\"\n1. `num_ones = 4`.\n2. `s_prime = \"2222\"`.\n3. First '2' in `s_prime` is at index 0. `first_two_idx = 0`.\n   `s_prime[0:0]` is \"\".\n   `num_ones * '1'` is \"1111\".\n   `s_prime[0:]` is \"2222\".\n   Result: \"\" + \"1111\" + \"2222\" = \"11112222\". This matches the example output.\n\nInput: \"20\"\n1. `num_ones = 0`.\n2. `s_prime = \"20\"`.\n3. First '2' in `s_prime` is at index 0. `first_two_idx = 0`.\n   `s_prime[0:0]` is \"\".\n   `num_ones * '1'` is \"\".\n   `s_prime[0:]` is \"20\".\n   Result: \"\" + \"\" + \"20\" = \"20\". This matches the example output.\n\nThis strategy seems correct and covers all cases. The logic relies on the fact that '1's are completely mobile relative to '0's and '2's, and '0's and '2's maintain their relative order. To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we prioritize '0's, then '1's, then '2's. The '1's are inserted at the earliest possible position without violating the '0'-'2' relative order constraint. That position is after all '0's that precede the first '2'. If no '2' exists, they go at the end. If '2's exist, they go right before the first '2'.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Iterate through the input string.\n- Count '1's.\n- Build `s_prime` by appending '0's and '2's.\n- Find the insertion point for '1's in `s_prime`.\n- Construct the final string.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    num_ones = 0\n    s_prime_chars = [] # To store '0's and '2's in their relative order\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            num_ones += 1\n        else:\n            s_prime_chars.append(char)\n    \n    s_prime = \"\".join(s_prime_chars)\n\n    # Find the index where '1's should be inserted\n    # '1's should be inserted after all '0's that come before the first '2'\n    # and before the first '2'.\n    first_two_idx = -1\n    for i in range(len(s_prime)):\n        if s_prime[i] == '2':\n            first_two_idx = i\n            break\n    \n    result_parts = []\n    if first_two_idx == -1:\n        # No '2's in s_prime.
