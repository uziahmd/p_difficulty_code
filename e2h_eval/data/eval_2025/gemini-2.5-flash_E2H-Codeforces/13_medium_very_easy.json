For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:** The challenge is to write a Python script that can identify a three-note triad as major, minor, or \"strange.\" I'll need to define how to numerically represent musical notes and then establish the criteria for major and minor triads. The tricky part is the \"unordered set\" nature of the input; the order of the notes doesn't matter, but the *intervals* between them do. My initial impulse is to map notes to integers (0-11), sort them, and calculate intervals, but that misses some nuance in the ordering of what is \"X, Y, Z.\"\n\nI've got a detailed plan. I'll translate the input notes into integer representations (C=0, C#=1, etc.). I need a consistent way to calculate the distances between these notes within an octave, considering the cyclical nature (e.g., the distance from C to E is 4, but from E to C is 8). The definitions for major and minor triads are based on the distances between the notes in a specific order. A major triad is a root, plus a major third (4 semitones up), plus a perfect fifth (7 semitones up). A minor triad is a root, plus a minor third (3 semitones up), plus a perfect fifth (7 semitones up).\n\nThe solution needs to consider all possible orderings of the notes to see if any of them fit either the major or minor triad criteria. I'll utilize the `itertools.permutations` library to explore all possible orderings. For each permutation, I can calculate the distances between the notes. If I find a distance of 4 followed by a distance of 3, that's a major triad. If I find a distance of 3 followed by 4, it is a minor. If I explore all of these cases without finding a match, the triad is \"strange.\" I need to be careful to get the \"upwards distance\" using the modulo operator to ensure that the calculation correctly wraps around the musical scale. I'll create a function `get_distance` to encapsulate this. I'll be sure the result makes sense for various examples. I am confident I can write the logic, incorporating note mapping, distance calculation with modulo arithmetic, permutation testing, and classification into a clear Python `solve()` function.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a given three-note triad as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\". A major triad has notes X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and from Y to Z is 3 semitones. A minor triad has notes X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 3 semitones and from Y to Z is 4 semitones. The notes are cyclic, and distances are measured upwards along the musical scale.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1.  **Map Notes to Integers:** We first need a way to represent the 12 notes numerically. We can assign C to 0, C# to 1, D to 2, and so on, up to H as 11. This allows us to perform arithmetic operations for distances.\n\n    ```\n    C: 0, C#: 1, D: 2, D#: 3, E: 4, F: 5,\n    F#: 6, G: 7, G#: 8, A: 9, B: 10, H: 11\n    ```\n\n2.  **Calculate Cyclic Distance:** The distance between two notes `note1` and `note2` (represented by their integer values `val1` and `val2`) is `(val2 - val1 + 12) % 12`. The `+ 12` and `% 12` handle the cyclic nature of notes (e.g., distance from H to C is 1 semitone, calculated as `(0 - 11 + 12) % 12 = 1`).\n\n3.  **Handle Unordered Triad:** A triad is an *unordered* set of three notes. The definitions of major and minor triads, however, require a specific *ordering* (X, Y, Z). This means we need to check if *any* possible ordering of the three given notes fits the major or minor pattern. For three notes, there are `3! = 6` possible permutations.\n\n4.  **Check Permutations:** We iterate through all 6 permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation `(X, Y, Z)`:\n    *   Calculate `dist_XY = distance(X, Y)`\n    *   Calculate `dist_YZ = distance(Y, Z)`\n    *   If `dist_XY == 4` and `dist_YZ == 3`, the triad is major.\n    *   If `dist_XY == 3` and `dist_YZ == 4`, the triad is minor.\n\n5.  **Output:** As soon as a match is found, we print \"major\" or \"minor\" and terminate, because the problem guarantees the answer will be unambiguous. If no permutation matches either a major or minor pattern after checking all 6 possibilities, the triad is \"strange\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (C E G):**\n\n1.  Notes to integers: C=0, E=4, G=7.\n2.  Consider the permutation `(0, 4, 7)` as `(X, Y, Z)`:\n    *   `dist_XY = (4 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 4`\n    *   `dist_YZ = (7 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 3`\n    *   This matches the major triad pattern (`dist_XY == 4` and `dist_YZ == 3`).\n3.  Output: \"major\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough (C# B F):**\n\n1.  Notes to integers: C#=1, B=10, F=5.\n2.  We need to find the specific permutation that matches. The problem states \"if we order the notes as B C# F\". Let's check this permutation: `(B, C#, F)` which is `(10, 1, 5)`.\n    *   `X=10, Y=1, Z=5`\n    *   `dist_XY = (1 - 10 + 12) % 12 = 3`\n    *   `dist_YZ = (5 - 1 + 12) % 12 = 4`\n    *   This matches the minor triad pattern (`dist_XY == 3` and `dist_YZ == 4`).\n3.  Output: \"minor\".\n\nThis approach covers all requirements and constraints efficiently.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    # Map note names to integer values (0-11)\n    note_map = {\n        \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n        \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n    }\n\n    # Read the three space-separated notes from standard input\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    notes_str = line\n\n    # Convert the string notes to their numerical integer values\n    notes_val = [note_map[s] for s in notes_str]\n\n    # Helper function to calculate the cyclic distance between two notes\n    # The distance is always measured upwards along the musical scale.\n    def get_distance(note_val1, note_val2):\n        return (note_val2 - note_val1 + 12) % 12\n\n    # Iterate through all possible permutations of the three notes.\n    # For a triad (3 notes), there are 3! = 6 permutations.\n    for p in itertools.permutations(notes_val):\n        # Assign the notes in the current permutation to X, Y, Z\n        X, Y, Z = p[0], p[1], p[2]\n\n        # Calculate the distances between X and Y, and Y and Z\n        dist_XY = get_distance(X, Y)\n        dist_YZ = get_distance(Y, Z)\n\n        # Check for a major triad pattern: (4 semitones, 3 semitones)\n        if dist_XY == 4 and dist_YZ == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return # Found a match, exit early\n\n        # Check for a minor triad pattern: (3 semitones, 4 semitones)\n        if dist_XY == 3 and dist_YZ == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return # Found a match, exit early\n\n    # If no major or minor pattern was found after checking all permutations\n    print(\"strange\")\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the logic\nsolve()\n\n```",
