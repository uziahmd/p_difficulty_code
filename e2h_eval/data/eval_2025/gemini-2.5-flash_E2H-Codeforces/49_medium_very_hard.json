They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm Outline: Mushroom Strife**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Mushroom Strife\" problem, and here's my plan. It's all about figuring out valid mushroom counts for each lawn, given GCDs and LCMs for connecting roads. The crux is using the relationship: `a * b = GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b)`.\n\nI'm thinking about it like this: for each edge, if we have the GCD (g) and LCM (l), the product of the mushroom counts at the endpoints is fixed as `g * l`. Crucially, if `l` is not a multiple of `g` we can immediately say \"NO\" since no solution exists.\n\nNow, let's say `mushrooms[u] = g * x` and `mushrooms[v] = g * y`. We know `x * y = l / g` and the GCD of x and y is 1. This means, after the check, we're finding *coprime* factors of `l/g`. The key insight is this: for any prime `p` that divides `l/g`, it *must* appear in either `x` or `y`, but not both. It's a \"binary choice\" for each prime.\n\nThis opens up a *2-coloring* approach.  I'll start by precomputing primes up to the square root of a million or so, and storing smallest prime factors for each number. Then, for each prime, I'll go through the graph and build a sub-graph where nodes are lawns, and edges represent prime factors.\n\nFor each prime factor `p`, I process each road to determine whether the exponent of `p` goes to `x` or `y`. If the GCD and LCM have the *same* exponent for a prime, it's fixed. If the exponents differ, it's a binary choice. I'll maintain an array to store all exponents for prime factors.\n\nFor this subgraph, I use a BFS or DFS algorithm. If I encounter any contradictions while assigning the values, I immediately say \"NO.\" If all subgraphs work (no conflicts), I reconstruct the mushroom counts by multiplying the prime powers.\n\nThe algorithm can be summarized as:\n\n1. **Preprocess:** Generate primes and smallest prime factors up to the square root of the max value.\n2. **Handle Edge cases**:  If `l % g != 0` for any edge, immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Prime factor analysis**:  For each prime `p`, analyze for the exponents from `g` and `l`.\n4. **Build subgraphs**:  Construct a graph for each prime.\n5. **Solve subgraphs**:  For each subgraph, perform a BFS.\n6. **Reconstruct solutions**: Build the final array by multiplying prime factors.\n\nThis strategy should give me a valid (or invalid) set of mushroom values! Let's see if I can get this working in Python.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to restore the number of mushrooms on `n` lawns, given `m` roads. For each road between lawns `u` and `v`, we are given `GCD(mushrooms[u], mushrooms[v])` and `LCM(mushrooms[u], mushrooms[v])`. We need to output any valid assignment or report if none exists. The numbers are between 1 and 10^6.\n\n**Key Property:**\nFor any two positive integers `a` and `b`, `GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b`.\nLet `m_u` be the number of mushrooms on lawn `u` and `m_v` on lawn `v`. For an edge `(u, v)` with given `g = GCD(m_u, m_v)` and `l = LCM(m_u, m_v)`, we have:\n1. `m_u * m_v = g * l`\n2. `GCD(m_u, m_v) = g`\n3. `LCM(m_u, m_v) = l`\n\n**Prime Factorization Approach:**\nLet `v_p(X)` denote the exponent of prime `p` in the prime factorization of `X`.\nFrom the properties above, for any prime `p`:\n1. `v_p(m_u) + v_p(m_v) = v_p(g) + v_p(l)`\n2. `min(v_p(m_u), v_p(m_v)) = v_p(g)`\n\nCombining these two equations, we can deduce:\n`max(v_p(m_u), v_p(m_v)) = v_p(g) + v_p(l) - min(v_p(m_u), v_p(m_v)) = v_p(g) + v_p(l) - v_p(g) = v_p(l)`.\n\nSo, for each prime `p` and each edge `(u, v)` with `g, l`:\nThe set `{v_p(m_u), v_p(m_v)}` must be equal to the set `{v_p(g), v_p(l)}`.\n\nThis is a crucial observation. It means that for each prime `p`, we need to determine for every node `i` whether `v_p(m_i)` should be `v_p(g)` or `v_p(l)` for its neighbors.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Precomputation:**\n    *   Generate all primes up to `10^6` using a Sieve of Eratosthenes. Store the smallest prime factor (SPF) for each number. This allows efficient prime factorization.\n    *   Store the given roads: `adj[u]` will contain a list of `(v, g, l)` tuples.\n\n2.  **Initial Checks:**\n    *   For each edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n        *   If `l % g != 0`, then no solution exists because `g` must divide `l`. Output \"NO\".\n        *   If `g > l`, then no solution exists because `GCD <= LCM`. Output \"NO\".\n\n3.  **Determine Exponents for Each Prime:**\n    *   We need to find `v_p(m_i)` for all `i` and for all primes `p` that appear in the factorization of any `g` or `l` value.\n    *   `ans_exponents[i]` will be a dictionary mapping a prime `p` to `v_p(m_i)`. Initialize `mushrooms[i] = 1` for all `i`.\n    *   `fixed_p_exponent[i]` will store the determined exponent for prime `p` at node `i`. Initialize to -1 (unknown).\n    *   `p_adj[u]` will store `(v, v_p(g), v_p(l))` for relevant edges.\n\n    Iterate through each prime `p` found in the precomputation:\n    *   Initialize `fixed_p_exponent` array for this `p` to -1.\n    *   Initialize a queue `q` for BFS.\n    *   **Phase 1: Process fixed exponent constraints.**\n        *   For each node `u` from `1` to `n`:\n            *   For each `(v, g, l)` in `adj[u]`:\n                *   Let `A = v_p(g)` and `B = v_p(l)`.\n                *   If `A == B`: This means `v_p(m_u)` and `v_p(m_v)` must both be `A`.\n                    *   If `fixed_p_exponent[u]` is already set and not equal to `A`, then conflict: output \"NO\".\n                    *   If `fixed_p_exponent[u]` is -1, set `fixed_p_exponent[u] = A` and add `u` to `q`.\n                    *   Do the same for `v`.\n    *   **Phase 2: Propagate fixed exponents using BFS.**\n        *   While `q` is not empty:\n            *   `curr = q.popleft()`\n            *   For each `(neighbor, g_nb, l_nb)` in `adj[curr]`:\n                *   Let `A_nb = v_p(g_nb)` and `B_nb = v_p(l_nb)`.\n                *   If `fixed_p_exponent[curr]` is `A_nb`: The required `fixed_p_exponent[neighbor]` is `B_nb`.\n                *   Else if `fixed_p_exponent[curr]` is `B_nb`: The required `fixed_p_exponent[neighbor]` is `A_nb`.\n                *   Else (if `fixed_p_exponent[curr]` is neither `A_nb` nor `B_nb`): This is a conflict. Output \"NO\".\n                *   If `fixed_p_exponent[neighbor]` is already set and not equal to the required value, then conflict: output \"NO\".\n                *   If `fixed_p_exponent[neighbor]` is -1, set it to the required value and add `neighbor` to `q`.\n    *   **Phase 3: Handle unvisited components (arbitrary choices for alternating constraints).**\n        *   For each node `u` from `1` to `n`:\n            *   If `fixed_p_exponent[u]` is still -1 (meaning `u` is in a component that was not fixed by Phase 1/2):\n                *   Start a new BFS from `u`. Arbitrarily set `fixed_p_exponent[u] = 0` (or `v_p(g_uv)` from an adjacent edge's `g` value if it exists and `v_p(g_uv) != v_p(l_uv)`). If `u` has no neighbors, `fixed_p_exponent[u]` can be 0.\n                *   Add `u` to `q`.\n                *   While `q` is not empty:\n                    *   `curr = q.popleft()`\n                    *   For each `(neighbor, g_nb, l_nb)` in `adj[curr]`:\n                        *   Let `A_nb = v_p(g_nb)` and `B_nb = v_p(l_nb)`.\n                        *   If `fixed_p_exponent[curr]` is `A_nb`: Required `fixed_p_exponent[neighbor]` is `B_nb`.\n                        *   Else if `fixed_p_exponent[curr]` is `B_nb`: Required `fixed_p_exponent[neighbor]` is `A_nb`.\n                        *   Else: (This should not happen if `fixed_p_exponent[curr]` was set correctly in this phase). Conflict: output \"NO\".\n                        *   If `fixed_p_exponent[neighbor]` is already set and not equal to the required value, then conflict (odd cycle in bipartite graph): output \"NO\".\n                        *   If `fixed_p_exponent[neighbor]` is -1, set it to the required value and add `neighbor` to `q`.\n\n    *   After iterating through all nodes for prime `p`, store `fixed_p_exponent[i]` into `ans_exponents[i][p]`.\n\n4.  **Construct Final Values:**\n    *   For each `i` from `1` to `n`:\n        *   Initialize `mushrooms[i] = 1`.\n        *   For each prime `p` in `ans_exponents[i]`:\n            *   `mushrooms[i] *= p ** ans_exponents[i][p]`.\n        *   If `mushrooms[i]` exceeds `10^6` (the maximum allowed value for `g` and `l`, implying `mushrooms[i]` also within this range), output \"NO\".\n\n5.  **Final Verification:**\n    *   For each edge `(u, v, g, l)`:\n        *   Calculate `actual_g = GCD(mushrooms[u], mushrooms[v])`.\n        *   Calculate `actual_l = LCM(mushrooms[u], mushrooms[v])`.\n        *   If `actual_g != g` or `actual_l != l`, then output \"NO\".\n\n6.  If all checks pass, output \"YES\" and then `mushrooms[1] ... mushrooms[n]`.\n\n**Optimization for Prime Factorization and `v_p(X)`:**\n*   Maximum value is `10^6`. Precompute SPF up to `10^6`.\n*   `v_p(X)` function:\n    ```python\n    def get_exponent(n, p, spf_arr):\n        count = 0\n        if p == 0 or n == 0: return 0 # Handle edge cases\n        while n > 1 and spf_arr[n] == p:\n            count += 1\n            n //= p\n        return count\n    ```\n    This `get_exponent` is for a single prime `p`. When iterating through all primes, it's better to factorize `g` and `l` once:\n    ```python\n    def factorize(n, spf_arr):\n        factors = {}\n        while n > 1:\n            p = spf_arr[n]\n            factors[p] = factors.get(p, 0) + 1\n            n //= p\n        return factors\n    ```\n    Then, for an edge `(u, v, g, l)`, get `g_factors = factorize(g, spf_arr)` and `l_factors = factorize(l, spf_arr)`.\n    The set of all relevant primes is `set(g_factors.keys()) | set(l_factors.keys())`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Sieve: `O(MAX_VAL * log log MAX_VAL)` where `MAX_VAL = 10^6`.\n*   Processing for each prime:\n    *   Number of distinct primes up to `10^6` is `~78k`.\n    *   For each prime, we do a BFS/DFS on the graph `O(N+M)`.\n    *   Total for primes: `O(NumPrimes * (N+M))`. This is too slow (`78k * 20k` is too much).\n\n**Refined Prime Factor Approach (Corrected and Optimized):**\nThe issue is that `NumPrimes` is large. The number of *unique* prime factors across all `g, l` values in the input is much smaller.\nLet `unique_primes` be the set of all prime factors appearing in any `g` or `l` from the input.\nThe size of `unique_primes` is at most `M * log(MAX_VAL)`. `10000 * log(10^6) approx 10000 * 20 = 200000`. Still potentially too many.\nHowever, the number of distinct prime factors of numbers up to `10^6` is limited. For `10^6`, `2^19 < 10^6 < 2^20`. So at most 20 distinct prime factors. This is not quite right. A number like `2*3*5*7*11*13*17 = 510510` has 7 distinct prime factors.\nThe total number of prime factors (counting multiplicity) for all `g, l` is `M * log(MAX_VAL)`.\n\nThe crucial observation is that we only need to care about primes `p` that actually divide some `g` or `l` in the input.\nFor each such prime `p`:\n1.  Define `node_p_exp[u]` as the exponent of `p` in `mushrooms[u]`. Initialize to -1.\n2.  `adj_p[u]` stores `(v, v_p(g), v_p(l))` for edges `(u, v, g, l)`.\n3.  Perform the 3-phase BFS/DFS process described above for this prime `p` on the graph `(N, adj_p)`.\n    *   The graph `(N, adj_p)` is effectively the original graph, but edges are annotated with `(v_p(g), v_p(l))`.\n    *   The `fixed_p_exponent` values are stored in `ans_exponents[u][p]`.\n\nThe total number of edges examined in the BFS/DFS for a single prime `p` is `O(N+M)`.\nThe total number of primes to consider is `P_total`, the total count of distinct prime factors across all `2M` values of `g` and `l`.\n`P_total` can be up to `2M * log(MAX_VAL)`. This is too large.\n\n**Alternative for primes:**\nInstead of iterating through primes, iterate through nodes.\n`ans[i]` stores `mushrooms[i]`. `ans[i]` is initialized to 1.\n`node_prime_state[u][p]` stores the determined exponent of `p` for `mushrooms[u]`.\n\n```python\n# Precompute SPF and primes\nMAX_VAL = 1000000\nspf = [0] * (MAX_VAL + 1)\nprimes = []\nfor i in range(2, MAX_VAL + 1):\n    if spf[i] == 0:\n        spf[i] = i\n        primes.append(i)\n    for p in primes:\n        if p > spf[i] or i * p > MAX_VAL:\n            break\n        spf[i * p] = p\n\n# Function to get prime factors and their exponents\ndef get_prime_factors(n):\n    factors = {}\n    while n > 1:\n        p = spf[n]\n        factors[p] = factors.get(p, 0) + 1\n        n //= p\n    return factors\n\n# Function to get exponent of a prime in a number\ndef get_v_p(n, p):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0 and n % p == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n //= p\n    return count\n\n# Main logic\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\nall_relevant_primes = set()\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    u, v, g, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    if l % g != 0 or g > l:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        sys.exit()\n    adj[u].append((v, g, l))\n    adj[v].append((u, g, l))\n    \n    #
