The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**I'm tackling the \"Frog Jumping\" problem, which asks me to find the sum of reachable positions within a range `[0, x]` for different values of `x`.** The frog can move by adding or subtracting fixed values `a` and `b`, but must never jump outside the range `[0, x]`. My goal is to optimize the calculation of the sum of `f(i)` where `f(i)` represents the number of distinct reachable integers within the range `[0, i]`.\n\nMy initial thought is to model this as a reachability problem on a graph, where integers are nodes and edges represent possible jumps.  The \"never jumps outside\" constraint is crucial, and essentially defines a connected component within the graph.  It's clear that the reachable numbers are multiples of the greatest common divisor (`gcd(a, b)`), but this alone isn't enough to solve the problem due to the range constraint.\n\nA simple Breadth-First Search (BFS) for each `x` to determine reachable positions appears straightforward, but it's far too slow for the large input values (up to 10^9).  I need a smarter approach. I start examining the behavior of `f(x)` as `x` increases and the impact of `a` and `b`. The key is to find the minimum `x` for which a number `k` is reachable.\n\nI consider the concept of `max_reach[k]`, which is the minimum value `x` for which `k` is reachable. This feels like a good direction to start, but I need to optimize this to avoid the brute-force approach.\n\nI then think about the limitations and how a Dijkstra could be a solution.  In essence, a Dijkstra-like algorithm seems the way to go to find the minimum \"maximum visited value\" required to reach each position. This is the bottleneck to optimize. However, directly applying Dijkstra is inefficient because it would need to keep track of the path as well as the states.\n\nThinking about number theory and modulo operations, I consider reducing the state space. It looks promising, but this isn't immediately obvious, and can be easily thrown off course. The key is in limiting the states.\n\nThe challenge is to find a way to efficiently determine if a number is reachable within a given range without having to simulate every possible jump. The idea of looking at values modulo `a` (or `b`) comes to mind to reduce the number of states for the Dijkstra algorithm. However, this raises questions about how to handle the constraint that *all* intermediate positions must be valid. Dijkstra on `a` (or `b`) states seems promising, but I am still struggling with how to apply this and get the correct result.\n\nThe core difficulty is efficiently calculating `f(x)`, particularly for large values of `x`. I keep playing around with state spaces and transformations to see if I can get to an answer faster, while keeping the constraints. I think I'll get there.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i in range(m + 1))`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps outside `[0, x]`. The frog starts at `0` and can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any position reachable by the frog must be a multiple of `g`. If a position `k` is not a multiple of `g`, it cannot be reached, so it does not contribute to `f(x)`. Thus, `f(x)` counts only multiples of `g` that are reachable within `[0, x]`.\nLet's define `d[k]` as the minimum possible value `X` such that `k` is reachable from `0` with all intermediate positions on the path being within `[0, X]`. If `k` is unreachable, `d[k] = infinity`.\nThe set of reachable points for a given `x` is `{k | 0 <= k <= x and d[k] <= x}`. Then `f(x) = |{k | 0 <= k <= x and d[k] <= x}|`.\n\nWe can compute `d[k]` for all `k` using a Dijkstra-like algorithm. The states in our Dijkstra will be the positions `k` themselves.\nInitialize `d[0] = 0` and `d[k] = infinity` for all `k > 0`.\nUse a min-priority queue `pq` storing `(current_max_pos, current_k)`. Initially, `pq = [(0, 0)]`.\nWhen we extract `(cur_max, u)` from `pq`:\n1. If `cur_max > d[u]`, we've found a better path to `u` already, so skip.\n2. Consider jumping to `u+a`: Let `v = u+a`. The new maximum position on the path would be `new_max = max(cur_max, v)`. If `new_max < d[v]`, update `d[v] = new_max` and push `(new_max, v)` to `pq`.\n3. Consider jumping to `u-b`: Let `v = u-b`. This jump is only valid if `v >= 0`. The new maximum position on the path would be `new_max = max(cur_max, u)`. (Note: `max(cur_max, v)` is also correct, but `v <= u`, so `max(cur_max, v)` is `cur_max` if `cur_max >= v`, otherwise `v`. The path to `u` already went up to `cur_max`, so `v` is always less than or equal to `u`, so `max(cur_max, v)` would be `cur_max` unless `v` itself is greater than `cur_max` which is impossible if `cur_max` is the max position up to `u` and `v < u`. So `new_max = cur_max` is correct for `u-b` jump. The crucial part is that `v` must be non-negative). If `v >= 0` and `cur_max < d[v]`, update `d[v] = cur_max` and push `(cur_max, v)` to `pq`.\n\nThe maximum value of `k` can be `m = 10^9`, which is too large for a `d` array.\nHowever, `a, b <= 10^5`. The \"interesting\" values of `d[k]` (where `d[k] != k`) tend to be concentrated for small `k`. For `k` large enough, `d[k]` will become `k`.\nSpecifically, if `k` is a multiple of `g` and `k >= max(a,b)`, then `k` is reachable from `0` without exceeding `k` itself. This is because we can always reach `k` by a sequence of `+a` and `-b` jumps, and if `k` is large enough, we can ensure all intermediate steps are `0 <= p <= k`.\nA more precise bound for when `d[k]=k` is approximately `a+b`. Let `LIMIT = a+b`. We can compute `d[k]` explicitly for `k` up to `LIMIT`.\n\nThe maximum number of states in our Dijkstra is `LIMIT`.\n`d` array size: `LIMIT+1`.\nPriority queue operations: `O(E log V)` where `V = LIMIT` and `E` is roughly `2*LIMIT`.\nSo computing `d[k]` for `k` up to `LIMIT` takes `O(LIMIT * log(LIMIT))` time.\n`LIMIT` can be up to `2 * 10^5`. This is feasible.\n\nAfter computing `d[k]` for `k` up to `LIMIT`:\n1. For `k > LIMIT` that are multiples of `g`, `d[k] = k`.\n2. For `k` that are not multiples of `g`, `d[k] = infinity`.\n\nNow we need to calculate `S = sum(f(i) for i in range(m + 1))`.\nRecall `f(x) = |{k | 0 <= k <= x and d[k] <= x}|`.\n`S = sum_{i=0 to m} sum_{k=0 to i, d[k] <= i} 1`.\nWe can swap the summations: `S = sum_{k=0 to m} sum_{i=d[k] to m, i >= k} 1`.\nThe inner sum is `sum_{i=max(k, d[k]) to m} 1`. This is `m - max(k, d[k]) + 1`.\nSo `S = sum_{k=0 to m, d[k] < infinity} (m - max(k, d[k]) + 1)`.\n\nLet `P = {k | 0 <= k <= m, d[k] < infinity}` be the set of all reachable points up to `m`.\n`S = sum_{k in P} (m - max(k, d[k]) + 1)`.\n\nWe iterate `k` from `0` up to `LIMIT`:\nIf `d[k]` is finite:\n  If `d[k] <= m`: we add `m - max(k, d[k]) + 1` to the total sum.\nFor `k > LIMIT`:\n  Only multiples of `g` are reachable, and `d[k] = k`.\n  So we need to sum `(m - k + 1)` for `k` such that `LIMIT < k <= m` and `k` is a multiple of `g`.\n  Let `k_start = (LIMIT // g + 1) * g`. This is the smallest multiple of `g` strictly greater than `LIMIT`.\n  We need to sum `(m - k + 1)` for `k = k_start, k_start+g, ..., m_g` where `m_g = (m // g) * g`.\n  This is an arithmetic progression: `(m - k_start + 1) + (m - (k_start+g) + 1) + ... + (m - m_g + 1)`.\n  Let `N = (m_g - k_start) // g + 1` be the number of terms.\n  The sum is `N * (m - k_start + 1 + m - m_g + 1) / 2`.\n  This sum needs to be added to `S`.\n\nExample walk-through `m=7, a=5, b=3`. `g = gcd(5,3) = 1`. `LIMIT = a+b = 8`.\nDijkstra for `d[k]` up to `8`:\n`d = [0, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf, inf]`\n`pq = [(0, 0)]`\n\n1.

If `d[k]` is `m+1`, then `d[k] > m`, and `k` is not counted.\nOr, simply use a large number like `2*10^9 + 7` for infinity. `m` is `10^9`.\n\nConsider `a=1, b=2019`. `g=1`. `A=2020`.\n`d[0]=0`.\n`d[k]=k` for all `k >= 0`.
