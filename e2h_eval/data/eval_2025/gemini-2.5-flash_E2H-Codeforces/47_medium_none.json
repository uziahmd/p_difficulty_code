    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this \"Neko does Maths\" problem and how I plan to solve it with a Python script.**\n\nThe core of it is this: I need to find a non-negative integer, `k`, that minimizes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k`. If there are multiple `k` values that give the same minimal LCM, I need to pick the smallest one.\n\nMy approach will be based on the relationship between LCM and greatest common divisor (GCD). I know that `LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y)`. So, I'll be working with this equation. I'll let `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`, and my goal is to minimize `(a+k)(b+k)` relative to the `GCD(a+k, b+k)`.\n\nNow, an important observation: the GCD of `a+k` and `b+k` has to be a divisor of the difference `b-a`.  I'll call this difference `d`. This means the GCD, which I'll denote as `g`, must divide `d`. So, I'll go through all the divisors of `d`, and for each one, find the `k` that makes that `g` a common factor, and then calculate the LCM.\n\nTo find `k`, I need to use modular arithmetic. If `g` divides `a+k`, then `a+k` is congruent to zero modulo `g`. This will tell me what values of `k` work.  I know that `a+k` being a multiple of `g` means `a + k ≡ 0 (mod g)`, hence `k ≡ -a (mod g)`. So the smallest non-negative integer `k` is calculated as `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`. This will be my candidate `k_g`.\n\nThen, for each possible GCD value (which is a divisor `g` of `d`), I will plug in the `k_g`, calculate the resulting `lcm`, and keep track of the smallest LCM I've found so far and the corresponding `k`.\n\nSo, in a nutshell:\n\n1.  Read `a` and `b`. If `a` equals `b`, the answer will always be `0`.\n2.  Calculate `d = |b - a|`.\n3.  Find all divisors of `d`. This takes O(sqrt(d)) operations.\n4.  For each divisor `g`: calculate `k = (g - (a % g)) % g`, and determine the value of `lcm(a+k, b+k)`.  Calculate the LCM using the formula.\n5.  Keep track of the minimum LCM and the associated `k`. If I find an LCM that's the same, I chose the smallest value of `k`.\n6.  Print the smallest `k`.\n\nThe key here is that I am iterating through *all* possible GCD values. `d = 10^9`, but the max divisors is 1344. So I can afford to iterate that many times.\nI am using GCD as an upperbound to iterate through.\n\nThe Python code I've written should handle all the details, like finding the divisors, calculating the `k` value, finding the LCM, and keeping track of the minimum. I also include the corner-case of when `a == b`. I will use efficient modular arithmetic and use the built-in GCD function. The code takes care of the edge case of finding the *smallest* k if two candidates yield the same LCM. I will optimize the code for I/O and any other available optimizations. Let's see how it goes!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a non-negative integer `k` that minimizes `lcm(a+k, b+k)`. If multiple `k` values yield the same minimum `lcm`, we must choose the smallest such `k`.\n\nLet `x = a+k` and `y = b+k`. We want to minimize `lcm(x, y)`.\nWe know the relationship `lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y)`.\n\nA key property of the greatest common divisor is that `gcd(X, Y)` must divide `|X - Y|`.\nIn our case, `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must divide `|(b+k) - (a+k)| = |b - a|`.\nLet `d = |b - a|`. So, `gcd(a+k, b+k)` must be a divisor of `d`.\n\nThis observation is crucial: it means we only need to consider values of `k` such that `a+k` and `b+k` share a common divisor `g` which is also a divisor of `d`.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume `a <= b`. If `a > b`, we can swap them. Then `d = b - a`.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Handle `a == b` special case**: If `a` equals `b`, then `lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k`. To minimize `a+k` for a non-negative `k`, we must choose `k=0`. The `lcm` would be `a`.\n\n2.  **Find all divisors of `d = |b - a|`**:\n    Iterate `i` from `1` up to `sqrt(d)`. If `i` divides `d`, then both `i` and `d // i` are divisors of `d`. Collect all these divisors into a set to handle duplicates (e.g., when `i * i == d`). The maximum value of `d` is approximately `10^9`, so `sqrt(d)` is about `31622`. The number of divisors for `d <= 10^9` is relatively small (at most 1344).\n\n3.  **Iterate through each divisor `g` of `d`**:\n    For each `g`, we need to find the smallest non-negative `k` such that `a+k` is a multiple of `g`. If `a+k` is a multiple of `g`, then `b+k = (a+d)+k = (a+k)+d`. Since `g` divides `d` and `g` divides `a+k`, it must also divide `b+k`.\n    The condition `a+k` is a multiple of `g` can be written as `a+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod g`, or `k \\equiv -a \\pmod g`.\n    The smallest non-negative `k` satisfying this congruence is `k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g`.\n\n4.  **Calculate `lcm` for `k_candidate`**:\n    For the `k_candidate` found in the previous step:\n    Let `x = a + k_candidate` and `y = b + k_candidate`.\n    Calculate `current_lcm = (x * y) // math.gcd(x, y)`.\n    Note that `x` and `y` can be up to `a + d` (roughly `2 * 10^9`), so `x * y` can be up to `4 * 10^{18}`. Python's integers handle arbitrary precision, so overflow is not an issue.\n\n5.  **Update minimum `lcm` and `best_k`**:\n    Initialize `min_lcm` to `infinity` and `best_k` to `0`.\n    Compare `current_lcm` with `min_lcm`:\n    *   If `current_lcm < min_lcm`, update `min_lcm = current_lcm` and `best_k = k_candidate`.\n    *   If `current_lcm == min_lcm`, update `best_k = min(best_k, k_candidate)` to ensure we pick the smallest `k` in case of ties.\n    (The `k=0` corresponding to `g=1` will always be evaluated first, setting `best_k` to `0` and `min_lcm` to `lcm(a,b)` initially.)\n\n6.  **Output `best_k`**: After checking all divisors `g`, `best_k` will hold the smallest `k` that results in the minimum `lcm`.\n\nThis approach checks all relevant `k` values derived from divisors of `|b-a|`. The time complexity will be dominated by finding divisors (`O(sqrt(D))`) and then iterating through them, performing a `gcd` calculation for each (`O(log(max(a,b)))`). Overall, it's efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Handle the special case where a and b are equal.\n    # lcm(a+k, b+k) = lcm(a+k, a+k) = a+k.\n    # To minimize a+k, choose the smallest non-negative k, which is 0.\n    if a == b:\n        sys.stdout.write(\"0\\n\")\n        return\n\n    # Ensure a <= b to simplify d = b - a.\n    # The problem is symmetric with respect to a and b.\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    # d is the absolute difference between a and b.\n    # We know that gcd(a+k, b+k) must divide (b+k) - (a+k) = b - a = d.\n    d = b - a\n\n    divisors = set()\n    # Find all divisors of d.\n    # Iterate up to sqrt(d).
