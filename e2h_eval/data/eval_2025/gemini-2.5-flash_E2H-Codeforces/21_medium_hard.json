The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Breakdown**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Neko Finds Grapes\" problem. The core is matching chests and keys where their sum is odd. Let's dig in. I need a Python script. I see `n` chests (`a_i`) and `m` keys (`b_j`). The rule is a key opens a chest if `a_i + b_j` is odd.  That means one has to be even and the other odd. If I have an even chest, I *must* use an odd key.  And vice-versa. No key or chest can be used twice. Maximize opened chests.\n\n**Developing the Matching Strategy**\n\nThe condition `a_i + b_j` is odd *only* if the parities are different (one even, one odd). If both even or both odd, the sum is even. I'll need to count the even and odd chests and keys. Let `chests_even`, `chests_odd`, `keys_even`, and `keys_odd` be these counts.\n\nMatching breaks down into two types: even chest with odd key and odd chest with even key.  The maximum pairs I can make of the first type is limited by the *smaller* count between `chests_even` and `keys_odd`. That number is `min(chests_even, keys_odd)`.  The second type, is similarly limited by `min(chests_odd, keys_even)`.  Since the chest and key types are distinct, the total maximum is just the sum of these two.\n\n**Verification and Time Complexity Analysis**\n\nI'm feeling good about this. Let me verify it with examples.  Example case checks out. It also matches Example 2 and 3. My formula's good.\n\nThe code will involve two loops, one for counting even/odd chests and another for keys. Both loops run `O(n+m)` time. The final calculation is constant. So the total time is `O(n+m)`. Since `n` and `m` are up to `10^5`, that's perfectly fine. Within the time limit.\n\n**Implementation Details and Optimization**\n\nI'll read in `n`, `m`, then the lists `a` and `b`. Initialize counters for even/odd chests and keys. Two loops to count those. And finally, the `min()` and the sum to get the result.\n\nPython list comprehensions can make the counting a little more concise, but the explicit loops are clear enough and won't affect performance much.  I'll use `sys.stdin.readline()` instead of `input()` for a slight speed boost, though for `10^5` size data, the improvement will be negligible.\n\n**Edge Cases and Final Checks**\n\nAny special cases? What if n or m is 1? I'll re-check my logic in those scenarios. It still works. I will verify one final time. All good! Let's clean up and submit. The question is a competitive programming question so I will remove all the added comments.\n",
