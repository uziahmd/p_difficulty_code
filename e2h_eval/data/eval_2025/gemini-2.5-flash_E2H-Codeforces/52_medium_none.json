Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this New Year Candles problem. The goal is to maximize the time Vasily can light his room, given some initial candles and a recycling scheme. My approach is to simulate the process step-by-step. I'm thinking of these key elements: `total_hours` (the answer), `current_new_candles` (what Vasily has right now), and `burnt_out_candles` (the used-up ones).\n\nThe core loop is like this: first, use up all the `current_new_candles`, adding their value to `total_hours`. Then, I'll update the `burnt_out_candles`. After that, I check if there are enough burnt ones (`burnt_out_candles`) to create new candles based on the `b` value. This is where integer division and modulo come in handy. I'll make the new candles and adjust the remaining burnt ones. I'll keep doing this until there are no more new candles and I can no longer make new ones.\n\nI ran through an example, `a=4, b=2`, to solidify my understanding. It confirms that the simulation logic works as expected. The constraints (`a <= 1000`, `b <= 1000`) mean a direct simulation is efficient enough.\n\nNow, translating this logic into Python. I'll read the input from `sys.stdin`, assuming lines represent test cases. Inside the loop, I'll manage the variables as described in the strategy. I'll be careful to use integer division and modulo correctly for the recycling step.\n\nI've crafted a code structure and confirmed the two example cases run properly.\n\nI've also run it through some basic checks, including edge cases like `a=1` to make sure it functions correctly, because I think a final solution is only really good if it holds for the simple and the extreme case.\n\nI think this should give me a solid solution!\n",
