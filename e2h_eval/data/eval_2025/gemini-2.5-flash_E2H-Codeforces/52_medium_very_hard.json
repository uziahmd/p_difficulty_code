Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this New Year Candles problem, and I need a Python script to solve it.  Essentially, we start with a certain number of candles, each burning for an hour.  Once they're burnt out, we can trade a certain number of those stubs for a new candle. The goal is to maximize the total burn time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem fully. We're given an initial number of candles (`a`) and a \"trade-in\" value (`b`).  The output should be the total number of hours the room is lit. I've sketched out an example with a=4, b=2 to visualize it.  \n\nThe core idea seems to be a simulation: We repeatedly burn candles, collect the burnt stubs, and then craft new candles until we can't anymore. I'll need to keep track of a few key variables: `total_hours`, `new_candles`, and `burnt_out_candles`.\n\nThe heart of the solution will be a `while` loop that continues as long as we have *any* candles to burn.  More specifically, the loop needs to run as long as `new_candles` are available or as long as `burnt_out_candles` are greater than or equal to `b`. A simpler way to write the loop condition is while `new_candles > 0`. The process is as follows: Inside the loop, burn all available new candles (updating `total_hours` and `burnt_out_candles`), then craft new candles (updating `new_candles` and `burnt_out_candles`).  We'll use integer division (`//`) to find how many new candles to create and the modulo operator (`%`) to handle any remaining stubs.\n\nI ran a trace of `a=4, b=2` and `a=6, b=3` using this approach.  The loop worked as expected, giving the correct total hours.\n\nThe problem states `a` and `b` are between 1 and 1000.  This implies the simulation won't take too long.\n\nReading the input, it looks like there might be multiple test cases, each on a separate line. The input is most likely coming in via `sys.stdin`. I'll handle that by reading lines one by one, splitting them into `a` and `b`, and then calling the core logic on those values.\n\nLet's test edge cases. What if we have one candle (`a=1`) and need two burnt stubs to make a new one (`b=2`)? The algorithm correctly produces one hour. What if `a` and `b` are the same? That scenario should also work correctly.\n\nI'm confident in the algorithm now.  The Python code is clean and handles multiple test cases. It should be efficient enough, given the problem constraints. I've double checked the logic and made sure it aligns with the problem description. Now it's time to test and submit!\n",
