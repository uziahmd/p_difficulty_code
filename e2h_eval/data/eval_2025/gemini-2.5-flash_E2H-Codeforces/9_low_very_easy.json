Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**The \"Selling Souvenirs\" Challenge: A Dynamic Programming Refinement**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, a knapsack variant. It seems straightforward initially – maximize cost under a weight constraint. But with a potentially large number of souvenirs and weight capacity, a standard dynamic programming approach (O(n*m)) isn't going to cut it. It'll be way too slow.\n\nThe core of this lies in the constraint of small souvenir weights: 1, 2, or 3. That's my key insight. I need to leverage this to get a much more efficient algorithm.\n\nMy initial thought is to categorize souvenirs by weight and sort them in descending order by cost. I'll have three lists: `costs1`, `costs2`, and `costs3`.  The goal is to maximize the combined cost of items I select, subject to the total weight limit `m`.\n\nThe initial plan looked something like a weighted average or some sort of maximization of `total_cost = x1 * c1_avg + x2 * c2_avg + x3 * c3_avg`. This still felt like a knapsack, but simplified by the weight constraint. The best strategy is to pick the most expensive item from each category.\n\nThe most promising idea is to iterate through possible combinations of souvenirs from each weight category. Suppose I consider picking `k3` items of weight 3. I'll subtract the weight (`k3 * 3`) and cost from total and find the maximum cost for the remaining capacity.\n\nNow, a nested loop feels like it might work. If I pick `k2` items of weight 2, and pick the optimal number of items from the weight 1 list. That nested iteration would lead to `O(m/3 * m/2 * m/1)`. This quickly gets me a runtime of `m^3`, which would also be too slow. So, back to the drawing board.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs to maximize their total cost, given a maximum total weight `m`. Each souvenir has a weight `w_i` and a cost `c_i`. The key constraint is that `w_i` can only be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThis is a variation of the knapsack problem. A standard dynamic programming solution for knapsack (O(N*M)) would be too slow given `N=10^5` and `M=3*10^5`. However, the small range of weights `w_i` allows for a more efficient approach.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Categorize and Sort:** First, separate the souvenirs into three lists based on their weights: `items1` (weight 1), `items2` (weight 2), and `items3` (weight 3). For each category, sort the costs in descending order. This is because to maximize cost, we should always pick the most expensive items first within a given weight category.\n\n2.  **Precompute Prefix Sums:** To quickly calculate the total cost of picking `k` most expensive items of a certain weight, we can compute prefix sums for each sorted cost list.\n    *   `prefix_sum1[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 1.\n    *   `prefix_sum2[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 2.\n    *   `prefix_sum3[k]` = sum of costs of the `k` most expensive items of weight 3.\n\n3.  **Iterate on Items of Weight 3:** The most significant weight is 3. Let's iterate through all possible numbers of items of weight 3 we might take. Suppose we take `k3` items of weight 3.\n    *   The weight consumed is `k3 * 3`.\n    *   The cost from these items is `prefix_sum3[k3]`.\n    *   The remaining capacity is `m_rem = m - k3 * 3`.\n    *   If `m_rem` becomes negative, we stop, as we cannot take more items of weight 3.\n\n4.  **Solve for Remaining Capacity with Weights 1 and 2:** For each `k3`, we now need to fill the remaining capacity `m_rem` using items of weight 1 and 2. This subproblem can be solved efficiently.\n    *   We can iterate through all possible numbers of items of weight 2, say `k2`.\n    *   The weight consumed by these is `k2 * 2`.\n    *   The cost from these is `prefix_sum2[k2]`.\n    *   The remaining capacity for weight 1 items is `m_rem1 = m_rem - k2 * 2`.\n    *   If `m_rem1` is negative, we stop for this `k2`.\n    *   The maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is `min(m_rem1, len(items1))`. Let this be `k1`.\n    *   The cost from these is `prefix_sum1[k1]`.\n    *   The total cost for this combination (`k3`, `k2`, `k1`) is `prefix_sum3[k3] + prefix_sum2[k2] + prefix_sum1[k1]`. We update our overall maximum cost.\n\n**Optimization for Weights 1 and 2:**\nThe nested loop `k3` then `k2` is `O(M/3 * M/2)`, which is still too slow (`O(M^2)`). We need a faster way to find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items for a given `m_rem`.\n\nNotice that for a fixed `m_rem`, as we increase `k2` (number of weight 2 items), `m_rem1` (capacity for weight 1 items) decreases.\nThe problem of picking items of weight 1 and 2 to fill `m_rem` can be rephrased: find `k1, k2` such that `k1*1 + k2*2 <= m_rem` and `prefix_sum1[k1] + prefix_sum2[k2]` is maximized.\n\nWe can iterate through `k2` from `0` up to `m_rem / 2`. For each `k2`, we calculate the remaining capacity `m_rem1 = m_rem - k2 * 2`. Then we take `min(m_rem1, len(items1))` items of weight 1.\nThis is still `O(M)`.\n\n**Combined Optimization:**\nConsider the total weight `W = k1*1 + k2*2 + k3*3`.\nThe maximum possible `k3` is `M/3`.\nThe maximum possible `k2` is `M/2`.\nThe maximum possible `k1` is `M`.\n\nLet's fix the number of weight 3 items (`i3`) and weight 2 items (`i2`). The remaining capacity `M - i3*3 - i2*2` can be filled with weight 1 items.\nThe number of such combinations is `O(M^2)`.\n\nHowever, we can iterate over `i3` (number of weight 3 items) and `i2_extra` (number of \"extra\" weight 2 items, those not paired with a weight 1 item to make a weight 3 item). This is not quite right.\n\nLet's stick to the idea of iterating `k3` and then finding the best `k1`, `k2`.\nFor a fixed `k3`, we have `m_rem` capacity for items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can iterate `k2` from `0` to `len(items2)` and `m_rem // 2`.\nFor each `k2`, we determine `k1 = min(m_rem - k2*2, len(items1))`.\nThis is `O(M/3 * M/2) = O(M^2)` which is too slow.\n\nThe key observation for the `W=1, W=2` subproblem:\nFor a given `m_rem`, we want to find `max(prefix_sum1[k1] + prefix_sum2[k2])` subject to `k1 + 2*k2 <= m_rem`.\nThis can be solved efficiently using a sliding window or two pointers approach.\nLet `j` be the index for `items2` (number of weight 2 items).\nLet `k` be the index for `items1` (number of weight 1 items).\nAs `j` increases (we take more weight 2 items), the remaining capacity for weight 1 items decreases.\nWe can precalculate the best `prefix_sum1[k1] + prefix_sum2[k2]` for various total weights `W_sub = k1 + 2*k2`.\nThis is a standard DP for small weights: `dp[w]` = max cost for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n`dp[w] = max(dp[w-1] + cost_w1, dp[w-2] + cost_w2)`. This would be `O(M)` to build.\nBut we need to pick the most expensive items.\n\nA better way for the `W=1, W=2` subproblem:\nLet `max_cost_1_2[w]` be the maximum cost achievable for a total weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\nInitialize `max_cost_1_2` array of size `m+1` to 0.\nIterate `k2` from `0` to `len(items2)`:\n  Current cost from weight 2 items: `current_cost2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`.\n  Current weight from weight 2 items: `current_weight2 = k2 * 2`.\n  If `current_weight2 > m_rem`, break.\n  Remaining capacity for weight 1 items: `rem_w1 = m_rem - current_weight2`.\n  Number of weight 1 items: `k1 = min(rem_w1, len(items1))`.\n  Total cost: `current_cost2 + prefix_sum1[k1]`. Update global max.\nThis is still `O(M)`.\n\n**The actual efficient approach used in competitive programming for small weights:**\n\n1.  **Separate and Sort:** Same as above. `items1`, `items2`, `items3` (sorted descending by cost).\n2.  **Prefix Sums:** Same as above. `prefix_sum1`, `prefix_sum2`, `prefix_sum3`.\n3.  **Iterate `k3` (number of weight 3 items):**\n    *   `k3` goes from `0` to `len(items3)`.\n    *   `current_cost = prefix_sum3[k3]`\n    *   `current_weight = k3 * 3`\n    *   If `current_weight > m`, break.\n    *   `remaining_capacity = m - current_weight`\n\n4.  **Iterate `k2` (number of weight 2 items):**\n    *   `k2` goes from `0` to `min(len(items2), remaining_capacity // 2)`.\n    *   `current_cost_2_3 = current_cost + prefix_sum2[k2]`\n    *   `current_weight_2_3 = current_weight + k2 * 2`\n    *   `remaining_capacity_for_1 = m - current_weight_2_3`\n    *   `k1 = min(len(items1), remaining_capacity_for_1)`\n    *   `total_cost = current_cost_2_3 + prefix_sum1[k1]`\n    *   Update `max_total_cost`.\n\nThis is `O(len(items3) * len(items2))`. In the worst case, `len(items3)` could be `N` and `len(items2)` could be `N`. This is `O(N^2)` which is too slow.\nHowever, `len(items3) * 3` and `len(items2) * 2` are both at most `M`. So `len(items3)` is at most `M/3` and `len(items2)` is at most `M/2`.\nSo the complexity is `O((M/3) * (M/2)) = O(M^2)`, which is `(3*10^5)^2 = 9*10^{10}`. Still too slow.\n\n**The actual correct approach for small weights `1, 2, 3`:**\n\nThe trick is to realize that the number of items of weight 2 or 3 we *really* need to iterate through is small.\nConsider the total weight `W`.\n`W = k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 + k3 * 3`.\nWe can iterate `k3` from `0` up to `M/3`.\nFor each `k3`, we have `m_rem = M - k3*3`.\nNow we need to pick items of weight 1 and 2 to fill `m_rem`.\nThis subproblem is: `maximize(cost1 + cost2)` subject to `w1 + w2 <= m_rem`.\nThis subproblem can be solved in `O(m_rem)` time by iterating `k2` from `0` to `m_rem/2` and then picking `k1` greedily.\nThe total time would be `O(M/3 * M) = O(M^2)`.\n\nThe final optimization for the `W=1, W=2` subproblem:\nFor a fixed `k3` and `m_rem`, we want to find `max(prefix_sum1[k1] + prefix_sum2[k2])` such that `k1 + 2*k2 <= m_rem`.\nWe can use a two-pointer approach or a precomputed array.\nLet `max_val_w1_w2[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\nThis array can be built in `O(M)` time.\n`max_val_w1_w2[w]` for `w` from `0` to `M`:\nIterate `k2` from `0` to `len(items2)`.\n  `current_cost_2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n  `current_weight_2 = k2 * 2`\n  If `current_weight_2 > M`, break.\n  `remaining_capacity_for_1 = M - current_weight_2`\n  `k1 = min(len(items1), remaining_capacity_for_1)`\n  `max_val_w1_w2[current_weight_2 + k1]` = max of current value and `current_cost_2 + prefix_sum1[k1]`.\nThis is not quite right because `k1` depends on `remaining_capacity_for_1`.\nThe `max_val_w1_w2[w]` should be defined as \"the maximum value we can get with EXACTLY weight `w` using items of weight 1 and 2\". This is a standard DP.\n\nLet's use a simpler approach for the `W=1, W=2` part:\nIterate `k2` from `0` to `len(items2)`.\n  `w2 = k2 * 2`\n  `c2 = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n  `rem_w = m - w2`\n  If `rem_w < 0`, break.\n  `k1 = min(len(items1), rem_w)`\n  `c1 = prefix_sum1[k1]`\n  `current_total_cost = c1 + c2`\n  Update `max_cost_for_1_2[w2 + k1]` with `current_total_cost`.\nThis builds `max_cost_for_1_2` by iterating `k2` and then greedily taking `k1`.\nThe `max_cost_for_1_2` array will store the maximum cost for a specific total weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\nAfter computing this, we need to make it monotonic: `max_cost_for_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_for_1_2[w], max_cost_for_1_2[w-1])`.\nThis means `max_cost_for_1_2[w]` will store the max cost for *up to* weight `w`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1.  Read `n, m`.\n2.  Create `items1`, `items2`, `items3` lists. Populate them by reading `w_i, c_i` and appending `c_i` to the respective list.\n3.  Sort `items1`, `items2`, `items3` in descending order.\n4.  Compute prefix sums: `prefix_sum1`, `prefix_sum2`, `prefix_sum3`.\n    *   `prefix_sum[k]` will store the sum of the first `k` elements (most expensive) from the original sorted list. `prefix_sum[0] = 0`.\n5.  Initialize `max_cost = 0`.\n6.  Create `max_cost_for_1_2` array of size `m+1`, initialized to 0. This array will store the maximum cost achievable for a given weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n    *   Iterate `k2` from `0` to `len(items2)`:\n        *   `w2_taken = k2 * 2`\n        *   If `w2_taken > m`, break.\n        *   `c2_taken = prefix_sum2[k2]`\n        *   `remaining_capacity_for_1 = m - w2_taken`\n        *   `k1_taken = min(len(items1), remaining_capacity_for_1)`\n        *   `c1_taken = prefix_sum1[k1_taken]`\n        *   `total_weight_1_2 = w2_taken + k1_taken`\n        *   `total_cost_1_2 = c1_taken + c2_taken`\n        *   `max_cost_for_1_2[total_weight_1_2] = max(max_cost_for_1_2[total_weight_1_2], total_cost_1_2)`\n    *   After filling `max_cost_for_1_2` with exact weight values, make it monotonic (prefix maximums):\n        *   For `w` from `1` to `m`: `max_cost_for_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_for_1_2[w], max_cost_for_1_2[w-1])`. This ensures `max_cost_for_1_2[w]` stores the max cost for *up to* weight `w`.\n\n7.  Iterate `k3` from `0` to `len(items3)`:\n    *   `w3_taken = k3 * 3`\n    *   If `w3_taken > m`, break.\n    *   `c3_taken = prefix_sum3[k3]`\n    *   `remaining_capacity = m - w3_taken`\n    *   `max_cost = max(max_cost, c3_taken + max_cost_for_1_2[remaining_capacity])`\n\n8.  Print `max_cost`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   Sorting: `O(N log N)` in worst case if all items are same weight, but actually `O(N_1 log N_1 + N_2 log N_2 + N_3 log N_3)` where `N_1+N_2+N_3 = N`.\n*   Prefix sums: `O(N_1 + N_2 + N_3) = O(N)`.\n*   Building `max_cost_for_1_2`: The loop for `k2` runs `len(items2)` times (at most `N` or `M/2`). Inside, constant time operations. So, `O(len(items2)) = O(N)` or `O(M)`.\n*   Making `max_cost_for_1_2` monotonic: `O(M)`.\n*   Final loop for `k3`: `len(items3)` times (at most `N` or `M/3`). Inside, constant time operations. So, `O(len(items3)) = O(N)` or `O(M)`.\n\nOverall complexity: `O(N log N + M)`.\nGiven `N=10^5`, `M=3*10^5`, this is efficient enough. `10^5 log(10^5) + 3*10^5` is roughly `10^5 * 17 + 3*10^5` which is in the order of `2*10^6` operations.\n\nExample Walkthrough: `4 3`, `(3,10), (2,7), (2,8), (1,1)`\n`n=4, m=3`\n\n1.
