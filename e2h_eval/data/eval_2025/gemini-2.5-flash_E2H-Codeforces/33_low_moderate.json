You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing a Number Through Digit Replacement**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking about this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. It's a classic optimization scenario, and my initial thought process is to break it down into smaller, manageable steps. First, I need to understand the constraints: I've got a number `a` and a set of digits `s`. I can replace digits in `a` using digits from `s`, but I can only use each digit from `s` once. The goal, of course, is to maximize the resulting number.\n\nThe key insight here is that maximizing a number means making its most significant digits as large as possible. This means a greedy approach is likely to work.  My strategy is to sort the digits in `s` in descending order. This ensures I always pick the largest available digit when making replacements, which aligns perfectly with the goal of maximizing the number.\n\nI'll iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right. For each digit in `a`, I'll compare it with the largest available digit in `s`. If the digit from `s` is *larger* than the current digit in `a`, then replacing it is beneficial and the obvious move to increase the magnitude of the target number. If it's not, I'll keep the current digit in `a` and move on, keeping that potentially smaller digit in `s` for later. This approach is all about prioritizing the most significant positions.\n\nMy algorithm will look something like this: I'll read in both `a` and `s` as strings and convert `a` to a mutable list or string builder for in-place modification. I'll sort `s` in descending order. Then, I'll iterate through `a` using a pointer for `s`, checking if any available digit in `s` is greater than a given digit in `a`. If so, I'll replace it and increment the `s` pointer; otherwise, I'll move on. In terms of big O complexity, this looks like O(n log n + m) where n and m are lengths of strings. It's a nice, simple, and elegant solution.\n",
