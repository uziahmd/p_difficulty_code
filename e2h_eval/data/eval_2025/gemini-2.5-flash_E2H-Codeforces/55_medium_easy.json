    "thought": "**Reflecting on Lexicographically Smallest String with Swaps**\n\nI've been given a challenging task: to determine the lexicographically smallest string achievable through specific swaps within a given string. The allowed moves are intriguing: '0' can swap with '1', and '1' can swap with '2'. Crucially, '0' and '2' cannot swap. This seemingly simple rule creates a fixed order for these characters and becomes the crux of the problem.\n\nThe goal is clear: produce a string where the characters are arranged in ascending order as much as possible, as early as possible. '0' is the smallest, then '1', and finally '2'. The \"not allowed\" swap (0 <-> 2) is a critical constraint. It suggests that any two '0's and '2's maintain their initial positions relative to each other.\n\nThe '1's are our \"free agents\" – they can freely move past any other characters. This freedom simplifies the strategy to some extent, because '1's don't need to be concerned with specific constraints other than putting them as far left as possible.\n\nThe core realization is that we need to fix the '0' and '2' positions. Any sequence like \"02\" must remain in that specific order, and the same with \"20\". The '1's can weave through any '0' and any '2', moving from left to right, or right to left.\n\nTo get the smallest string, I need to collect all '0's first, and then build around their original relative order. Here's my strategy: first build a list of all '0's and '2's that are in original order, then count how many ones are present and at what place each of them must be inserted. After this, calculate where the ones should be inserted. Any '1' encountered must be placed before any '2' from the original sequence. If all are '0's (like \"000\"), all '1's must be added at the end. Any '2' can't be crossed by a '0'. The remaining '1's are added after '0's, and before '2's.\n\nSo, construct the string by building the new sequence with the smallest character, then incrementing the next one, but keeping the '0'-'2' order fixed, with '1's inserting before the first '2'.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string by performing specific adjacent swaps: '0' with '1' ('01' <-> '10') and '1' with '2' ('12' <-> '21'). Swapping '0' and '2' is not allowed.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed operations:\n1.  **'0' and '1' can swap**: This means '0's and '1's can move past each other. If you have a sequence of only '0's and '1's (e.g., \"0101\"), you can arrange them into any permutation (e.g., \"0011\").\n2.  **'1' and '2' can swap**: Similarly, '1's and '2's can move past each other. A sequence like \"1212\" can be rearranged to \"1122\".\n3.  **'0' and '2' CANNOT swap**: This is the critical constraint. A '0' cannot move past a '2', and a '2' cannot move past a '0'. This implies that the *relative order* of '0's and '2's in the string is fixed. If an original string has a '0' at index `i` and a '2' at index `j`:\n    *   If `i < j` (the '0' is before the '2'), then this specific '0' must remain before this specific '2' in the final string.\n    *   If `i > j` (the '2' is before the '0'), then this specific '2' must remain before this specific '0' in the final string.\n\nCombining these observations:\n*   The relative order of all '0's and '2's in the string is preserved. We can think of them as forming a rigid backbone.\n*   '1's are \"mobile\". Since a '1' can swap with a '0' and also with a '2', a '1' can effectively move past any '0' or any '2'. This means all '1's can be grouped together and inserted anywhere into the fixed '0'-'2' backbone.\n\nTo obtain the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place smaller characters ('0's) as far left as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Separate '0's, '1's, and '2's (conceptually):**\n    *   Iterate through the input string `s`.\n    *   Count the total number of '1's. Let this be `ones_count`.\n    *   Collect all '0's and '2's into a temporary list, preserving their original relative order. Let this be `zero_two_chars`.\n\n    *Example*: If `s = \"100210\"`\n    *   `ones_count` will be 2 (from `s[0]` and `s[4]`).\n    *   `zero_two_chars` will be `['0', '0', '2', '0']` (from `s[1], s[2], s[3], s[5]`).\n\n2.  **Determine insertion point for '1's:**\n    *   The `zero_two_chars` list represents the fixed relative order of '0's and '2's.\n    *   To make the string lexicographically smallest, we want to place '1's after all '0's but before any '2's that appear in `zero_two_chars`.\n    *   Find the index of the *first* '2' in `zero_two_chars`. Let this be `first_two_idx`.\n        *   If a '2' exists, `first_two_idx` will be its position. All '1's should be inserted at this position. This places them after any '0's that came before this '2', and before this '2' itself.\n        *   If no '2' exists in `zero_two_chars` (meaning the original string only had '0's and '1's, or only '0's), then all '0's are at the beginning of `zero_two_chars`. The '1's should be appended to the end of `zero_two_chars` (after all '0's). In this case, `first_two_idx` can be considered `len(zero_two_chars)`.\n\n3.  **Construct the final string:**\n    *   Create a list of `ones_count` '1's.\n    *   Insert this list of '1's into `zero_two_chars` at the `first_two_idx`.\n    *   Join the resulting character list into a single string.\n\n**Detailed Steps for Implementation:**\n\n1.  Initialize `result_chars = []` (an empty list to build the '0's and '2's backbone).\n2.  Initialize `ones_count = 0`.\n3.  Iterate through each character `c` in the input string `s`:\n    *   If `c == '0'`, append `'0'` to `result_chars`.\n    *   If `c == '1'`, increment `ones_count`.\n    *   If `c == '2'`, append `'2'` to `result_chars`.\n4.  Find the `insertion_index` for the '1's:\n    *   Initialize `insertion_index = len(result_chars)` (default to append at the end).\n    *   Loop `i` from `0` to `len(result_chars) - 1`:\n        *   If `result_chars[i] == '2'`, set `insertion_index = i` and `break` the loop.\n5.  Create a list of '1's: `ones_list = ['1'] * ones_count`.\n6.  Construct the final character list by slicing and concatenating:\n    `final_chars = result_chars[:insertion_index] + ones_list + result_chars[insertion_index:]`.\n7.  Join `final_chars` to form the output string: `\"\".join(final_chars)`.\n8.  Print the output string.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `s = \"100210\"`**\n\n1.  Initialize `result_chars = []`, `ones_count = 0`.\n2.  Iterate `s`:\n    *   `'1'`: `ones_count = 1`.\n    *   `'0'`: `result_chars = ['0']`.\n    *   `'0'`: `result_chars = ['0', '0']`.\n    *   `'2'`: `result_chars = ['0', '0', '2']`.\n    *   `'1'`: `ones_count = 2`.\n    *   `'0'`: `result_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`.\n    After iteration: `result_chars = ['0', '0', '2', '0']`, `ones_count = 2`.\n3.  Find `insertion_index`:\n    *   Default `insertion_index = len(result_chars) = 4`.\n    *   `result_chars[0]` is '0'.\n    *   `result_chars[1]` is '0'.\n    *   `result_chars[2]` is '2'. Set `insertion_index = 2`, `break`.\n4.  `ones_list = ['1'] * 2 = ['1', '1']`.\n5.  `final_chars = result_chars[:2] + ones_list + result_chars[2:]`\n    `final_chars = ['0', '0'] + ['1', '1'] + ['2', '0']`\n    `final_chars = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '2', '0']`.\n6.  `\"\".join(final_chars)` results in `\"001120\"`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(N) due to single passes through the string and list operations (which are O(N) for slicing/concatenation in Python). Space complexity is O(N) for storing the character lists. Given the constraint N <= 10^5, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    result_chars = []\n    ones_count = 0\n\n    # Step 1: Separate '0's, '1's, and '2's\n    for char_s in s:\n        if char_s == '0':\n            result_chars.append('0')\n        elif char_s == '1':\n            ones_count += 1\n        else: # char_s == '2'\n            result_chars.append('2')\n\n    # Step 2: Determine insertion point for '1's\n    insertion_index = len(result_chars) # Default: append at the end if no '2's\n    for i, char_rc in enumerate(result_chars):\n        if char_rc == '2':\n            insertion_index = i\n            break\n    \n    # Step 3: Construct the final string\n    ones_list = ['1'] * ones_count\n    \n    # Insert '1's at the determined insertion_index\n    # This creates a new list by concatenating three parts\n    final_chars = result_chars[:insertion_index] + ones_list + result_chars[insertion_index:]\n    \n    print(\"\".join(final_chars))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
