For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself.

Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "**Reflecting on a Dynamic Programming Solution for a Complex Counting Problem**\n\nI'm tackling a challenging programming problem where I need to count the number of ways to choose values `c_s` such that the maximum size of a specific multiset, defined by a \"beautiful\" property, is exactly `f`. This \"beauty\" is constrained by the values `c_s` for prefixes of binary strings. My initial thought process revolves around understanding this \"beautiful\" multiset.\n\nI've determined that the key to understanding the problem lies in the relationship between a string and its prefixes, and their associated constraints `c_s`.  The core idea is to express the maximum size of this multiset using a dynamic programming (DP) approach on a binary trie.  Each node in the trie represents a prefix, and `dp[u]` represents the maximum number of strings in the multiset that have the prefix represented by node `u`.  I define a function `V(s)` as the maximum possible count for string `s`.\n\nI quickly realize that `V(s)` is `min(c_s, V(s0) + V(s1))` where `s0` and `s1` are children of `s` and `s0` is `s` with a 0 appended to it, and `s1` is `s` with a 1 appended to it.  The constraint `c_s` limits the number of strings we can choose with a given prefix `s`. The total max size of the multiset is then `V(\"\")`, where \"\" is the empty string.  To count the number of ways to pick these `c_s`'s that lead to a specific value `f`, I define `f[L][val]` as the number of ways to assign the `c_s` values for strings of lengths `L` to `n` such that `V(s)`, where `s` is a length `L` string, evaluates to `val`. This quickly becomes complex as the calculation of `V(s)` depends on the values of its descendants.\n\nThe critical insight I have is that `V(s)` can never exceed `k`, the upper bound on `c_s`. This vastly simplifies my DP approach.  Because the structure of the trie is symmetrical, all strings of a fixed length `L` are equivalent. To overcome the dependency issue, I define a helper DP state: I try to calculate `g[L][sum_val]`, the number of ways to choose values for a string and all its descendants to have `V(s0) + V(s1) = sum_val`. To move to the next layer I use the constraint that `V(s)` equals `min(c_s, V(s0) + V(s1))`. \n\nThen, I can compute `f[L][val]` in terms of `g[L]`: `f[L][val] = suff_g[L][val+1] + g[L][val] * (k - val + 1)`. I calculate `g` as the convolution of the `f` array from the next level.  This makes a relationship that can be iteratively solved. Finally, the answer I need to return is the value `g[0][f]`.\n\nTo optimize this I will implement the convolution step with Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), since normal convolution is inefficient. I'm choosing a prime modulus suitable for NTT and ensuring the correct size of the NTT arrays. Even with these optimizations, I remain slightly concerned about Python's performance, given the large state space and the convolution steps, and I will be mindful of those as I implement.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers `c_s` for all binary strings `s` of length `1` to `n` (where `0 <= c_s <= k`), such that the maximum possible size of a \"beautiful\" multiset of strings of length `n` is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo `998244353`.\n\nLet `V(s)` be the maximum possible number of strings in a beautiful multiset that have `s` as a prefix.\nThe definition of a beautiful multiset implies that for any string `s`, the count of strings in the multiset having `s` as a prefix, let's call it `count(s)`, must satisfy `count(s) <= c_s`.\nAlso, for any string `s` of length less than `n`, `count(s) = count(s0) + count(s1)`, where `s0` and `s1` are its children (i.e., `s` followed by '0' and '1' respectively).\nTo maximize the total size of the multiset, we want to maximize `count(s)` for each `s`.\nThis leads to the following recursive definition for `V(s)`:\n1. If `len(s) = n`: `V(s) = c_s`. (This is the maximum number of times string `s` can appear in the multiset.)\n2. If `len(s) < n`: `V(s) = min(c_s, V(s0) + V(s1))`.\n\nThe total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is the sum of `V(s)` for all `s` of length `n`. This is equivalent to `V(\"\")` if we define `c_\"\"` to be effectively infinite. Since `c_s` is only defined for `len(s) >= 1`, the total maximum size is `V(\"0\") + V(\"1\")` (where \"0\" and \"1\" are strings of length 1).\n\nA crucial observation is that `V(s) <= c_s` for any `s`. Since `c_s <= k`, it must be that `V(s) <= k` for any string `s` of length `1` to `n`.\nThis significantly limits the range of possible values for `V(s)`.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming based on the length of the string `s`. Let `f[L][val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_{s'}` for all strings `s'` that are descendants of a fixed string `s` of length `L` (including `s` itself), such that `V(s)` evaluates to `val`.\nSince all nodes at the same depth `L` are structurally identical, `f[L][val]` is the same for any `s` of length `L`.\n\nLet's define `f[L]` as a polynomial or an array where `f[L][val]` is the coefficient of `x^val`.\nThe maximum value `val` can take for `f[L]` is `k`.\n\nBase case: `L = n`.\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `V(s) = c_s`. We can choose `c_s` from `0` to `k`.\nSo, `f[n][val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`, and `0` otherwise. This is an array of size `k+1`.\n\nRecursive step: For `L` from `n-1` down to `1`.\nTo compute `f[L][val]`:\n`V(s) = min(c_s, V(s0) + V(s1))`.\nLet `v0 = V(s0)` and `v1 = V(s1)`. The number of ways to achieve `v0` is `f[L+1][v0]`, and `v1` is `f[L+1][v1]`.\nThe choices for `s0` and `s1` are independent.\nLet `g[L][sum_val]` be the number of ways to choose `c_{s'}` for descendants of `s0` and `s1` such that `V(s0) + V(s1) = sum_val`.\n`g[L]` is the convolution of `f[L+1]` with itself: `g[L] = f[L+1] * f[L+1]`.\nSince `v0, v1 <= k`, `sum_val = v0 + v1` can range from `0` to `2k`. So `g[L]` is an array of size `2k+1`.\n\nNow, we compute `f[L][val]` for `0 <= val <= k`:\n`f[L][val] = sum_{sum_val} g[L][sum_val] * (number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, sum_val) = val)`.\nWe consider two cases for `c_s` (which must be `0 <= c_s <= k`):\n1. If `val < sum_val`: For `V(s)` to be `val`, we must choose `c_s = val`. There is `1` way to do this. (This is only possible if `val <= k`).\n2. If `val = sum_val`: For `V(s)` to be `val`, we must choose `c_s >= val`. There are `k - val + 1` ways to do this. (This is only possible if `val <= k`).\nCombining these, for `0 <= val <= k`:\n`f[L][val] = (sum_{sum_val = val+1}^{2k} g[L][sum_val] * 1) + (g[L][val] * (k - val + 1))`.\nThis can be computed efficiently using suffix sums of `g[L]`. Let `suff_g[L][j] = sum_{i=j}^{2k} g[L][i]`.\nThen `f[L][val] = suff_g[L][val+1] + g[L][val] * (k - val + 1)`.\nNote that `suff_g[L][2k+1]` should be 0.\n\nAfter computing `f[1]`, the total maximum size of a beautiful multiset is `V(\"0\") + V(\"1\")`. This is exactly the `sum_val` for `L=0`.\nSo, the final answer is `g[0][f]`, where `g[0] = f[1] * f[1]`.\nThe maximum possible value for `V(\"0\") + V(\"1\")` is `2k`. If `f > 2k`, the answer is `0`.\n\nThe modulo is `998244353`. This is a prime suitable for Number Theoretic Transform (NTT).\nThe size of the arrays for NTT needs to be a power of 2, at least `2k+1`. Given `k <= 2 * 10^5`, `2k+1 <= 4 * 10^5 + 1`. The smallest power of 2 greater than this is `2^19 = 524288`.\nThe time complexity for each level `L` is `O(N_NTT log N_NTT)` for convolution and `O(k)` for suffix sums and `f[L]` calculation. Total time complexity is `O(n * N_NTT log N_NTT)`.\n`15 * 524288 * 19` is approximately `1.5 * 10^8`, which is acceptable for typical competitive programming time limits (usually 1-2 seconds) if implemented efficiently (e.g., in C++). Python's performance might be an issue.\n\nLet's summarize the algorithm:\n1. Initialize `MOD = 998244353`.\n2. Determine `N_NTT`, the smallest power of 2 greater than `2k`.\n3. Implement NTT functions (forward and inverse).\n4. Initialize `f_current` (representing `f[L+1]`) as an array of size `k+1`. Set `f_current[val] = 1` for `0 <= val <= k`.\n5. Iterate `L` from `n-1` down to `0`.\n   a. Pad `f_current` to `N_NTT` length with zeros.\n   b. Perform forward NTT on `f_current` to get `F_NTT`.\n   c. Compute `G_NTT = [ (x * x) % MOD for x in F_NTT ]`. (Pointwise product in frequency domain)\n   d. Perform inverse NTT on `G_NTT` to get `g_next` (representing `g[L]`). This `g_next` will have length `N_NTT`, but we only care about elements up to `2k`.\n   e. If `L == 0`, then `g_next[f]` is the answer. If `f > 2k`, the answer is `0`. Return this value.\n   f. If `L > 0`:\n      i. Compute `suff_g_next` (suffix sums of `g_next` up to `2k`). `suff_g_next[j] = sum_{i=j}^{2k} g_next[i]`.\n      ii. Initialize `f_new` (representing `f[L]`) as an array of size `k+1`.\n      iii. For `val` from `0` to `k`:\n          `term1 = suff_g_next[val+1]` (or `0` if `val+1 > 2k`).\n          `term2 = (g_next[val] * (k - val + 1)) % MOD`.\n          `f_new[val] = (term1 + term2) % MOD`.\n      iv. Set `f_current = f_new` for the next iteration.\n\nThe `NTT` implementation requires a primitive root of `MOD`. For `998244353`, `3` is a common primitive root.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f_target = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    MOD = 998244353\n    PRIMITIVE_ROOT = 3\n\n    # NTT implementation\n    def ntt(a, invert):\n        n_size = len(a)\n        j = 0\n        for i in range(1, n_size):\n            bit = n_size >> 1\n            while j >= bit:\n                j -= bit\n                bit >>= 1\n            j += bit\n            if i < j:\n                a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]\n\n        len_half = 1\n        while len_half < n_size:\n            wlen = pow(PRIMITIVE_ROOT, (MOD - 1) // (len_half * 2), MOD)\n            if invert:\n                wlen = pow(wlen, MOD - 2, MOD)\n            \n            for i in range(0, n_size, len_half * 2):\n                w = 1\n                for j in range(len_half):\n                    u = a[i + j]\n                    v = (a[i + j + len_half] * w) % MOD\n                    a[i + j] = (u + v) % MOD\n                    a[i + j + len_half] = (u - v + MOD) % MOD\n                    w = (w * wlen) % MOD\n            len_half *= 2\n\n        if invert:\n            n_inv = pow(n_size, MOD - 2, MOD)\n            for i in range(n_size):\n                a[i] = (a[i] * n_inv) % MOD\n        return a\n\n    # Maximum possible sum_val is 2k.\n    # N_NTT must be a power of 2 >= 2k + 1.\n    N_NTT = 1\n    while N_NTT <= 2 * k:\n        N_NTT <<= 1\n\n    # f_current represents f[L+1]\n    # It stores counts for V(s) values from 0 to k.\n    # Initialize f[n]\n    f_current = [0] * (k + 1)\n    for val in range(k + 1):\n        f_current[val] = 1\n\n    # If f_target > 2k, it's impossible to achieve, so answer is 0.\n    if f_target > 2 * k:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Iterate L from n-1 down to 0\n    for L in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        # Pad f_current to N_NTT length\n        f_padded = f_current + [0] * (N_NTT - len(f_current))\n\n        # Perform forward NTT\n        F_NTT = ntt(f_padded, False)\n\n        # Compute pointwise product (convolution in frequency domain)\n        G_NTT = [(x * x) % MOD for x in F_NTT]\n\n        # Perform inverse NTT to get g_next (convolution result)\n        g_next = ntt(G_NTT, True)\n\n        # If L == 0, g_next contains the counts for V(\"0\") + V(\"1\")\n        if L == 0:\n            print(g_next[f_target])\n            return\n\n        # For L > 0, compute f[L] from g[L]\n        # g_next contains values up to 2k.\n        # Compute suffix sums for g_next\n        suff_g_next = [0] * (2 * k + 2) # suff_g_next[j] stores sum_{i=j}^{2k} g_next[i]\n        for j in range(2 * k, -1, -1):\n            suff_g_next[j] = (suff_g_next[j + 1] + g_next[j]) % MOD\n        \n        f_new = [0] * (k + 1)\n        for val in range(k + 1):\n            term1 = suff_g_next[val + 1] # sum_{sum_val = val+1}^{2k} g_next[sum_val]\n            term2 = (g_next[val] * (k - val + 1)) % MOD\n            f_new[val] = (term1 + term2) % MOD\n        \n        f_current = f_new\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
