Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$.

    "thought": "**Analyzing Competitive Programming with Rooks and Queens**\n\nI'm working on a competitive programming problem involving an N x N board where I need to arrange numbers so a rook pays fewer \"vuns\" than a queen.  The rules are: start at cell 1, move to the unvisited cell with the smallest number reachable in one move (rook: horizontal/vertical; queen: horizontal/vertical/diagonal), and teleport to the smallest unvisited cell if stuck (no reachable unvisited cells) – paying a vun.  The goal is to design a board where the rook gets stuck and teleports (paying a vun) less often than the queen.\n\nFirst, I looked at the trivial case: N=1. Both rook and queen are on the same cell, zero vuns.  The problem states it should be -1. This sets a base case to consider. For N=2 I started thinking of how to lay out the numbers, trying to make the rook pay less.\n\nA key observation is that the queen's movement capabilities are always a superset of the rook's. The crucial idea: if the rook is stuck (can't move to an unvisited cell), the queen might still have a move, particularly diagonally.  I want to make the rook get stuck, but the queen stay unstuck. Therefore, to make the rook pay fewer vuns, I must construct a scenario where a rook is stuck but a queen is not.\n\nI considered a checkerboard-like pattern for number placement, where the sums of row and column indexes have alternating parity.  A rook always switches parity, while a queen can stay on the same parity diagonally. But this leads to a situation where the rook gets stuck with a queen. I also have to consider N=4 example:\n4  3  6 12\n7  5  9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\nThe N=4 example board seemed to work.  Tracing the moves, I noticed the rook got stuck at (1,3) with value 15, paying a vun, while the queen *also* got stuck at the same cell! However, both could move to the next unvisited spot. The key moment occurred when the rook had exhausted all horizontal/vertical neighbors, whereas the queen, while having exhausted H and V also had a diagonal unvisited cell. Therefore, I needed to figure out why this setup, despite both getting stuck at a point, allows the rook to pay fewer vuns in the final analysis.\n\nUltimately, I need to force the rook into a scenario where its reachable cells are all visited (meaning it teleports, costing a vun), while the queen still has a diagonal option available, delaying its teleport.  This means putting smaller numbers in a way that the rook will hit a dead end, while a diagonal is still open for the queen. The challenge lies in arranging the numbers on the board to create this specific situation. I'll need to develop a systematic approach to generate such boards for larger N.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to construct an $N \\times N$ board with numbers from $1$ to $N^2$ such that a rook pays strictly less vuns than a queen. If no such board exists, we should output $-1$.\n\nLet's recap the rules for paying vuns:\n1. Start at cell with number $1$. This cell is visited.\n2. In each step:\n   a. Identify all unvisited cells reachable in one move from the current cell.\n   b. If there are such cells, move to the one with the minimal number among them. Mark it visited.\n   c. If all accessible cells were already visited AND there are still unvisited cells on the board, teleport to the unvisited cell with the minimal number. Pay 1 vun. Mark it visited.\n   d. If all cells are already visited, the process stops.\n\nA rook moves horizontally or vertically. A queen moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\nThis means the set of cells accessible to a queen is always a superset of (or equal to) the set of cells accessible to a rook.\n\nLet $C_{cur}$ be the current cell.\nLet $U$ be the set of unvisited cells on the board.\nLet $R_{acc}(C_{cur})$ be the set of unvisited cells reachable by a rook from $C_{cur}$.\nLet $Q_{acc}(C_{cur})$ be the set of unvisited cells reachable by a queen from $C_{cur}$.\nWe know $R_{acc}(C_{cur}) \\subseteq Q_{acc}(C_{cur})$.\n\nA piece pays a vun if $R_{acc}(C_{cur}) = \\emptyset$ (for rook) or $Q_{acc}(C_{cur}) = \\emptyset$ (for queen) AND $U \\ne \\emptyset$.\n\nTo make the rook pay strictly less vuns than the queen, we need to create a situation where the rook pays a vun but the queen does not, or the queen pays a vun more often than the rook.\n\nConsider the case where $R_{acc}(C_{cur}) = \\emptyset$ but $Q_{acc}(C_{cur}) \\ne \\emptyset$.\nIn this scenario, the rook would pay a vun (if $U \\ne \\emptyset$), while the queen would move to $\\min(Q_{acc}(C_{cur}))$. This is the opposite of what we want. This would make the rook pay more vuns.\n\nWe need the opposite: $Q_{acc}(C_{cur}) = \\emptyset$ but $R_{acc}(C_{cur}) \\ne \\emptyset$. This is impossible because $R_{acc}(C_{cur}) \\subseteq Q_{acc}(C_{cur})$. If $Q_{acc}(C_{cur})$ is empty, $R_{acc}(C_{cur})$ must also be empty.\n\nTherefore, if a piece pays a vun, it means all cells reachable by that piece are visited. Since a queen can reach all cells a rook can (and possibly more), if a rook's reachable cells are all visited, a queen's reachable cells *might* still include some unvisited diagonal cells. But if a queen's reachable cells are all visited, a rook's reachable cells must also be all visited.\n\nThis implies that if the rook pays a vun from $C_{cur}$, the queen either also pays a vun from $C_{cur}$ (if $Q_{acc}(C_{cur}) = \\emptyset$) or the queen moves (if $Q_{acc}(C_{cur}) \\ne \\emptyset$).\nIf the queen pays a vun from $C_{cur}$, the rook must also pay a vun from $C_{cur}$ (because $R_{acc}(C_{cur}) = \\emptyset$ too).\n\nSo, the only way for the rook to pay strictly less vuns is if there's a point where the rook needs to pay a vun, but the queen does not. This means, at some point, the rook is at $C_{cur}$, $R_{acc}(C_{cur}) = \\emptyset$, $Q_{acc}(C_{cur}) \\ne \\emptyset$, and $U \\ne \\emptyset$. In this case, the rook pays 1 vun and teleports, while the queen moves to $\\min(Q_{acc}(C_{cur}))$. The queen continues its path, possibly paying vuns later. The rook, having paid a vun, teleports to the global minimum unvisited cell and continues its path.\n\nThis suggests a strategy:\n1. Make the rook get stuck (all its horizontal/vertical neighbors are visited).\n2. Ensure there's an unvisited diagonal neighbor with a small number.\n3. The rook pays a vun, but the queen moves to that diagonal neighbor.\nThis means the rook pays a vun, and the queen does not. This is one vun difference. We need to ensure the queen doesn't catch up in vuns later.\n\nLet's try to construct such a board.\nConsider placing numbers in a specific pattern.\nWe can fill the board by alternating between two sets of numbers.\nLet's divide the $N \\times N$ cells into two groups:\n- Group A: cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is even.\n- Group B: cells $(i, j)$ where $i+j$ is odd.\nIf $N$ is even, there are $N^2/2$ cells in Group A and $N^2/2$ cells in Group B.\nIf $N$ is odd, there are $(N^2+1)/2$ cells in one group and $(N^2-1)/2$ in the other.\n\nA rook always moves between cells of different parity sums. (e.g., from Group A to Group B).\nA queen can move between cells of different parity sums (HV moves) or cells of the same parity sum (diagonal moves).\n\nStrategy:\n1. Place all numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ on cells of one parity (say, Group A).\n2. Place all numbers $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ on cells of the other parity (Group B).\nLet's try placing $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ on Group A cells and $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ on Group B cells.\nAssume cell $(0,0)$ is in Group A. Number 1 is placed at $(0,0)$.\n\nRook's path:\nStarts at $(0,0)$ (Group A, value 1).\nIt can only move to Group B cells. It will pick the smallest available Group B cell.\nIt will exhaust all reachable Group B cells. Once all reachable Group B cells are visited, it will be stuck (because it can only move to Group B cells).\nAt this point, if there are still unvisited Group A cells, it will pay a vun and teleport to the smallest unvisited Group A cell.\n\nQueen's path:\nStarts at $(0,0)$ (Group A, value 1).\nIt can move to Group B cells (HV) or Group A cells (diagonal).\nThe queen will have more options. It will pick the smallest available cell, regardless of parity.\n\nThis approach might make the queen pay fewer vuns, as it has more choices to avoid getting stuck. We want the rook to pay fewer vuns.\n\nLet's reverse the strategy.\nPlace numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ on Group B cells.\nPlace numbers $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ on Group A cells.\nStart at cell $(0,0)$ (Group A). The value here will be large, say $N^2/2+1$. This is problematic because the starting cell must be 1.\n\nSo, the cell with number 1 needs to be specifically chosen.\nLet's try to put numbers $1, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ into one set of cells (say, Group A, $i+j$ even) and the remaining numbers into Group B ($i+j$ odd).\nThe actual values should be:\nFor $N$ even:\nAssign numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ to cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is odd.\nAssign numbers $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ to cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even.\nThis way, the smallest numbers are on the \"black\" cells.\nStart at cell $(0,0)$. This cell is \"white\" ($0+0=0$ is even). Its value is $N^2/2+1$.\nThis is not allowed, as we must start at cell with number 1.\n\nThis implies that the cell with 1 must be placed strategically.\nThe example output for $N=4$ has 1 at $(2,1)$, which is $2+1=3$ (odd).\nNumbers $1,2,3,4$ are placed at:\n1: (2,1) - odd\n2: (3,3) - even\n3: (0,1) - odd\n4: (0,0) - even\n\nThe example output for $N=4$ has rook vuns = 1, queen vuns = 2.\nThe key moment for the rook was at (1,3), value 15. All its HV neighbours were visited. Rook paid 1 vun for 14.\nThe key moment for the queen was at (1,3), value 15. All its HV and diagonal neighbours were visited. Queen paid 1 vun for 14.\nThen, from 14 (at (2,0)), the rook had no unvisited cells left. It stopped.\nBut the queen from 14 (at (2,0)) had an unvisited diagonal cell (3,2) with value 16. So the queen paid another vun for 16.\nThis is the difference: the rook finished its path, but the queen still had an unvisited cell reachable diagonally, forcing it to pay another vun.\n\nThis means we want to construct a board such that:\n1. The rook and queen follow similar paths for most numbers.\n2. At some point, the rook has visited all cells, but the queen has not.\n3. At this point, the queen has no accessible cells from its current position, but there are still unvisited cells. This forces the queen to pay a vun. The rook, having visited all cells, pays no more vuns.\n\nThis is exactly what happens in the $N=4$ example!\nThe rook visits all cells $1, \\ldots, 15, 14$. Total 16 cells. 1 vun.\nThe queen visits cells $1, \\ldots, 15, 14, 16$. Total 16 cells. 2 vuns.\n\nThis implies that after the rook has completed its path (meaning all $N^2$ cells are visited), the queen's path might still have unvisited cells. This is a contradiction, as both pieces visit cells until all $N^2$ cells are visited. The only way for the queen to pay more vuns is if it gets stuck more times than the rook *during the process of visiting all cells*.\n\nLet's re-read the example explanation carefully:\nRook: $1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$.\nQueen: $1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$.\n\nThe explanation says the rook visits 16 cells and pays 1 vun.\nThe queen visits 16 cells and pays 2 vuns.\nThis means, at the point when the rook pays its 1 vun (to get to 14), there are still unvisited cells.\nAnd at the point when the queen pays its 1st vun (to get to 14), there are still unvisited cells.\nAnd at the point when the queen pays its 2nd vun (to get to 16), there are still unvisited cells. This last part is impossible, as 16 is the largest number. After 16 is visited, all cells are visited.\n\nThe problem statement says: \"If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped.\"\nSo, when the queen moves to 16, all cells are visited. It cannot pay a vun to get to 16. It must have moved to 16 from some current cell.\n\nLet's re-trace the example to be very precise.\nBoard:\n4  3  6 12\n7  5  9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nCoordinates:\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)\n(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)\n\nValues:\ngrid[0] = [4, 3, 6, 12]\ngrid[1] = [7, 5, 9, 15]\ngrid[2] = [14, 1, 11, 10]\ngrid[3] = [13, 8, 16, 2]\n\n1.

Path: 1,3,4,2,5,6,9,7,13,8,11,10,12,15,14,16. (Matches example description)\n\nHold on, the example description says queen pays 2 vuns. My trace gives 1 vun for both.\n\"Queen goes through $1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$.\"\nThis implies that when queen is at 14, all its accessible cells are visited and 16 is still unvisited. Let's check this.\nWhen Queen is at (2,0) with value 14.\nVisited cells: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15}. Unvisited: {16}.\nCurrent (2,0), val 14.\nQ_acc from (2,0):\nHV: (2,1) 1(vis), (2,2) 11(vis), (2,3) 10(vis), (0,0) 4(vis), (1,0) 7(vis), (3,0) 13(vis). All visited.\nDiag: (0,2) 6(vis), (1,1) 5(vis), (3,1) 8(vis), (3,2) 16.\nSo Q_acc is {16}. The queen moves to 16. It does not pay a vun here.\n\nThis means my trace results in Rook 1 vun, Queen 1 vun. This is not strictly less.\nThe example output for N=4 must be wrong in its trace or my understanding of it.\nThe problem statement itself is consistent: \"As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\"\nThis means the queen must pay a vun to get to 16. This requires that from 14, all queen-accessible cells (except 16) are visited, and 16 is unvisited, and 16 is NOT queen-accessible. But 16 is diagonally accessible from 14.\nAha, (2,0) to (3,2) is a diagonal move. So 16 IS accessible.\n\nThe only way the queen pays a vun for 16 is if it's at a position where 16 is the global minimum unvisited cell, but it's not accessible from the current position.\nIf the queen path is $... \\to X \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to Y \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$.\nThis means from $X$, 14 is the global minimum unvisited, but not accessible.\nAnd from $Y$, 16 is the global minimum unvisited, but not accessible.\n\nLet's check the example's queen path again: $1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15$.\nCurrent cell is (1,3), value 15.\nUnvisited: {14, 16}.\nQ_acc from (1,3):\nHV: (1,0) 7(vis), (1,1) 5(vis), (1,2) 9(vis), (0,3) 12(vis), (2,3) 10(vis), (3,3) 2(vis). All visited.\nDiag: (0,2) 6(vis), (2,1) 1(vis), (3,0) 13(vis). All visited.\nSo Q_acc is empty. Unvisited is {14, 16}. Min unvisited is 14.\nQueen pays 1 vun, teleports to 14. `vuns = 1`. Visited: {...,15,14}. Current (2,0).\n\nNow queen is at (2,0), value 14.\nUnvisited: {16}.\nQ_acc from (2,0):\nHV: (2,1) 1(vis), (2,2) 11(vis), (2,3) 10(vis), (0,0) 4(vis), (1,0) 7(vis), (3,0) 13(vis). All visited.\nDiag: (0,2) 6(vis), (1,1) 5(vis), (3,1) 8(vis), (3,2) 16.\nQ_acc is {16}. The queen moves to 16. It does not pay a vun. `vuns` remains 1.\n\nMy trace is consistent with the rules, but not with the example's stated queen vuns.\nThis suggests either:\n1. The example explanation has a typo in the queen's vuns.\n2. My interpretation of \"accessible\" or \"visited\" is subtly wrong.\n   - \"Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move\" - This is clear.\n   - \"If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited\" - This is clear.\n   - \"then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number.\" - Clear.\n\nLet's assume the example description is correct, and there's a scenario where the queen pays 2 vuns.\nIf the queen pays 2 vuns, it means it got stuck twice.\nIf the rook pays 1 vun, it means it got stuck once.\nHow can the queen get stuck at 14, then move to 16, and then get stuck again?\nIf the queen is at 14, and 16 is unvisited, and 16 is not accessible, then queen pays a vun for 16.\nBut 16 (at (3,2)) is diagonally accessible from 14 (at (2,0)).\nThis means my interpretation of diagonal accessibility must be wrong.\nA queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance.\n(2,0) and (3,2) are on the same diagonal ($i-j = 2-0=2$, $3-2=1$). No, they are not on the same $i-j$ diagonal.\nThey are on the same $i+j$ anti-diagonal: $2+0=2$, $3+2=5$. No, they are not.\nIs (2,0) to (3,2) a queen move? Yes, it's a move of $(+1, +2)$. This is not a standard queen move.\nA queen moves like a rook or a bishop.\nBishop moves: cells $(r \\pm k, c \\pm k)$.\nSo, (2,0) to (3,2) is NOT a queen move. My mistake!\nA queen moves $(r \\pm k, c)$ or $(r, c \\pm k)$ or $(r \\pm k, c \\pm k)$ or $(r \\pm k, c \\mp k)$.\nSo, from (2,0), queen can reach:\n(2,j) for j!=0\n(i,0) for i!=2\n(2-k, 0-k) for k!=0 (i.e. (1,-1) no, (0,-2) no)\n(2+k, 0+k) for k!=0 (i.e. (3,1), (4,2) no)\n(2-k, 0+k) for k!=0 (i.e. (1,1), (0,2))\n(2+k, 0-k) for k!=0 (i.e. (3,-1) no, (4,-2) no)\n\nLet's list actual queen-reachable cells from (2,0):\nHV: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (0,0), (1,0), (3,0).\nDiagonal (same $i-j$ or $i+j$):\n$i-j=2$: (1,-1) no, (3,1).\n$i+j=2$: (1,1), (0,2).\nSo, from (2,0), Queen can reach:\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n(0,0), (1,0), (3,0)\n(3,1)\n(1,1), (0,2)\n\nLet's re-trace Queen's vuns with correct queen moves:\n... (Queen is at (1,3), value 15. Q_acc is empty. Unvisited is {14, 16}. Min unvisited is 14.)\nQueen pays 1 vun, teleports to 14. `vuns = 1`. Visited: {...,15,14}. Current (2,0).\nNow queen is at (2,0), value 14.\nUnvisited: {16}.\nQ_acc from (2,0):\nHV: (2,1) 1(vis), (2,2) 11(vis), (2,3) 10(vis), (0,0) 4(vis), (1,0) 7(vis), (3,0) 13(vis). All visited.\nDiagonal: (3,1) 8(vis), (1,1) 5(vis), (0,2) 6(vis). All visited.\nSo Q_acc is empty. Unvisited is {16}. Min unvisited is 16.\nQueen pays 1 vun. Teleport to (3,2). `vuns = 2`. `path.append(16)`. `visited.add((3,2))`. Current (3,2).\nAll $N^2=16$ cells are visited. Process stops.\nQueen vuns: 2. This matches the example! My queen move understanding was the problem.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\nMake the rook get stuck once, and pay a vun.\nMake the queen get stuck twice, and pay two vuns.\nThis means, at the point when the rook pays a vun, the queen also pays a vun. This is fine, both have 1 vun.\nThen, the rook path finishes. But the queen's path continues, and it gets stuck *again* for the last unvisited cell.\n\nFor $N=1$, both 0 vuns. Output -1.\nFor $N=2, N^2=4$.\nCells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\nIf we put 1 at (0,0).\nRook can reach (0,1), (1,0). Queen can reach (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\nIf we put 2 at (0,1), 3 at (1,0), 4 at (1,1).\nRook: $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$. (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,0). From (1,0), (0,0) (vis), (0,1) (vis), (1,1) unvis (4). Rook moves to (1,1). Path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4$. Vuns: 0.\nQueen: $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4$. Vuns: 0.\nThis doesn't work.\n\nWhat if we place 1, 2, ..., $N^2/2$ on cells of one type, and $N^2/2+1, ..., N^2$ on cells of another type?\nLet's divide the grid into two halves.\nTop-left half: $(i,j)$ where $i < N/2$ or $j < N/2$.\nBottom-right half: $(i,j)$ where $i \\ge N/2$ and $j \\ge N/2$.\nThis is not clean.\n\nLet's use the example's pattern.\nThe example board for $N=4$:\n4  3  6 12\n7  5  9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n\nNumbers:\n1 to $N^2/2$ (1 to 8 for N=4)\n$N^2/2+1$ to $N^2$ (9 to 16 for N=4)\n\nLet's try to fill numbers such that:\n1. All numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ are placed in cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is odd.\n2. All numbers $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ are placed in cells $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even.\nThis means all small numbers are on \"black\" cells.\nThere are $N^2/2$ odd-sum cells and $N^2/2$ even-sum cells (for even $N$).\nLet's fill odd-sum cells with $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ and even-sum cells with $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nWe need to assign them in order.\nAssign $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ to odd-sum cells in reading order (row by row, then col by col).\nAssign $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ to even-sum cells in reading order.\n\nExample $N=4$:\nOdd-sum cells: (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2). (8 cells)\nEven-sum cells: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3). (8 cells)\n\nFill odd-sum cells with $1, \\ldots, 8$:\n(0,1) = 1\n(0,3) = 2\n(1,0) = 3\n(1,2) = 4\n(2,1) = 5\n(2,3) = 6\n(3,0) = 7\n(3,2) = 8\n\nFill even-sum cells with $9, \\ldots, 16$:\n(0,0) = 9\n(0,2) = 10\n(1,1) = 11\n(1,3) = 12\n(2,0) = 13\n(2,2) = 14\n(3,1) = 15\n(3,3) = 16\n\nBoard:\n9  1 10  2\n3 11  4 12\n13  5 14  6\n7 15  8 16\n\nLet's trace this board.\nCell 1 is at (0,1).\n`visited = {(0,1)}`, `current_pos = (0,1)`\n\n**Rook:**\nPath: [1]\n1.

Rook 1 vun, Queen 0 vuns.\n\nGeneralizing the strategy:\n1. Create an $N \\times N$ board `grid`.\n2. Initialize `odd_cells` and `even_cells` lists with coordinates $(i,j)$ for $0 \\le i, j < N$.\n   `odd_cells` contains $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is odd.\n   `even_cells` contains $(i,j)$ where $i+j$ is even.\n3. Sort `odd_cells` and `even_cells` in reading order (row-major).\n4. Fill `odd_cells` with numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, |\\text{odd_cells}|$.\n5. Fill `even_cells` with numbers $|\\text{odd_cells}|+1, \\ldots, N^2$.\n\nThis construction places all smaller numbers on cells of one parity sum and all larger numbers on cells of the other parity sum.\nWhen the piece starts at 1 (which is on an odd-sum cell), it will prioritize visiting other odd-sum cells if accessible (queen).\nBut a rook can only move to even-sum cells from an odd-sum cell, and vice-versa.\nSo, from an odd-sum cell, a rook can only move to cells with values $> |\\text{odd_cells}|$.\nFrom an even-sum cell, a rook can only move to cells with values $\\le |\\text{odd_cells}|$.\n\nLet's analyze the rook.\nIt starts at 1 (odd-sum cell).\nIt will pick the smallest even-sum cell it can reach.\nIt will alternate between odd-sum and even-sum cells.\nThe rook will quickly exhaust all small numbers (odd-sum cells) reachable from its current even-sum cell.\nWhen it is on an even-sum cell, it can only move to odd-sum cells. If all reachable odd-sum cells are visited, it gets stuck.\nWhen it is on an odd-sum cell, it can only move to even-sum cells. If all reachable even-sum cells are visited, it gets stuck.\n\nIn our construction, $1, \\ldots, |\\text{odd_cells}|$ are on odd-sum cells.\n$|\\text{odd_cells}|+1, \\ldots, N^2$ are on even-sum cells.\nThe rook will start at 1 (odd-sum). It will try to move to an even-sum cell (value $> |\\text{odd_cells}|$).\nThen from that even-sum cell, it will try to move to an odd-sum cell (value $\\le |\\text{odd_cells}|$).\nIt will keep picking the smallest available number.\nEventually, it will visit all odd-sum cells and all even-sum cells.\n\nThe key to the rook paying 1 vun and queen paying 0 vuns (or rook $k$ vuns, queen $k-1$ vuns) is that the rook gets stuck and pays a vun, while the queen does not.\nThis happens if $R_{acc}(C_{cur}) = \\emptyset$ but $Q_{acc}(C_{cur}) \\ne \\emptyset$.\nThis is when all HV cells are visited, but there's an unvisited diagonal cell.\nIn our construction, the queen can always move between cells of the same parity (diagonally).\nThe rook cannot.\nSo, if the current cell is an even-sum cell, and all its HV neighbours are visited, but there's an unvisited even-sum cell diagonally, the rook gets stuck. The queen moves to that diagonal cell.\nThis means the rook pays a vun, but the queen does not. This is exactly what we want!\n\nThis strategy seems to ensure the rook pays at least one more vun than the queen.\nThe rook starts at 1 (odd-sum cell). It moves to an even-sum cell. Then an odd-sum cell. It will exhaust all small numbers.\nWhen the rook is on an even-sum cell, it has values $>\\text{max_odd_val}$. Its reachable odd-sum cells have values $\\le \\text{max_odd_val}$.\nWhen the rook is on an odd-sum cell, it has values $\\le \\text{max_odd_val}$. Its reachable even-sum cells have values $>\\text{max_odd_val}$.\n\nLet's verify the initial conditions.\n$N=1$: Board is 1. Rook 0 vuns, Queen 0 vuns. Output -1. My strategy would produce this.\nThe problem requires strictly less. So $N=1$ is -1.\n\nWhat about $N=2$?\nOdd cells: (0,1), (1,0). Value $1, 2$.\nEven cells: (0,0), (1,1). Value $3, 4$.\nBoard:\n3 1\n2 4\n\nRook:\n1. (0,1) val 1 (odd). R_acc: (0,0) 3, (1,1) 4. Min: 3 at (0,0). Path: [1,3].\n2. (0,0) val 3 (even). R_acc: (1,0) 2. Min: 2 at (1,0). Path: [1,3,2].\n3.

(1,1) val 4 (even). All cells visited. Stop.\nQueen vuns: 0.\n\nThis strategy produces 0 vuns for both for $N=2$. So $N=2$ should also be -1.\nThe problem output for $N=1$ is -1. For $N=4$ it gives a solution.\nWhat about $N=3$? My trace gave Rook 1, Queen 0. This works.\nThe strategy works for $N=3, N=4$. It fails for $N=2$.\nMy $N=2$ trace:\nRook: (0,1) 1 -> (0,0) 3 -> (1,0) 2 -> (1,1) 4.\nQueen: (0,1) 1 -> (1,0) 2 -> (0,0) 3 -> (1,1) 4.\nIn both cases, they just follow the numbers. No vuns.\n\nWhy does it fail for $N=2$?\nFrom (0,0), Queen can reach (1,1) diagonally.\nFrom (0,1), Queen can reach (1,0) diagonally.\nFrom (1,0), Queen can reach (0,1) diagonally.\nFrom (1,1), Queen can reach (0,0) diagonally.\nIn an $N=2$ board, every cell is accessible from every other cell by a queen (except itself).\nFor example, from (0,0), queen can reach (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\nFrom (0,1), queen can reach (0,0), (1,1), (1,0).\nThis means the queen will never get stuck on a $2 \\times 2$ board unless all other 3 cells are already visited.\nSimilarly for rook. From (0,0), rook can reach (0,1), (1,0).\nFrom (0,1), rook can reach (0,0), (1,1).\n\nFor $N=2$, there are only 4 cells. It's hard to make one piece pay a vun if the other doesn't.\nIf one piece pays a vun, it means its accessible cells are all visited.\nIf the rook pays a vun, it means its 2-3 accessible cells are visited.\nIf the queen pays a vun, it means its 3-4 accessible cells are visited.\nIf the rook pays a vun, it means its accessible cells are visited. But the queen might still have unvisited cells accessible diagonally.\n\nConsider $N=2$.\nBoard:\n3 1\n2 4\nRook is at (0,1) val 1. R_acc: {(0,0) 3, (1,1) 4}.\nQueen is at (0,1) val 1. Q_acc: {(0,0) 3, (1,1) 4, (1,0) 2}.\nQueen picks 2. Rook picks 3. So they diverge.\nRook path: 1 (0,1) -> 3 (0,0) -> 2 (1,0) -> 4 (1,1). Vuns: 0.\nQueen path: 1 (0,1) -> 2 (1,0) -> 3 (0,0) -> 4 (1,1). Vuns: 0.\n\nThe construction of placing small numbers on odd-sum cells and large numbers on even-sum cells generally works for $N \\ge 3$.\nFor $N=1,2$, output -1.\nFor $N \\ge 3$:\nCreate an $N \\times N$ matrix.\nIterate $i$ from $0$ to $N-1$, $j$ from $0$ to $N-1$.\nIf $i+j$ is odd, add $(i,j)$ to `odd_coords`.\nIf $i+j$ is even, add $(i,j)$ to `even_coords`.\nFill `odd_coords` with numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, |\\text{odd_coords}|$.\nFill `even_coords` with numbers $|\\text{odd_coords}|+1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nPrint the resulting matrix.\n\nThis is a specific construction. The problem asks for *any* solution.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is different from what my construction generates.\nMy construction for $N=4$:\n9  1 10  2\n3 11  4 12\n13  5 14  6\n7 15  8 16\nRook 1 vun, Queen 0 vuns. This is a valid solution.\n\nFinal check for $N=1,2$.\nIf $N=1$, board is [1]. Rook vuns=0, Queen vuns=0. Not strictly less. So -1.\nIf $N=2$, board has 4 cells.\nLet's try to construct a situation where rook pays 1, queen 0.\nRook gets stuck, queen moves diagonally.\nRook at (0,0). Neighbors (0,1), (1,0) are visited.\nBut (1,1) is unvisited. Queen moves to (1,1). Rook pays vun.\nThis means numbers on (0,1), (1,0) must be smaller than (1,1).\nSay 1 at (0,0), 2 at (0,1), 3 at (1,0), 4 at (1,1).\nPath: 1 -> 2 -> 3. Rook at (1,0). R_acc: (0,0) vis, (0,1) vis, (1,1) unvis. Rook moves to (1,1). No vun.\nThis seems impossible for $N=2$. The board is too small for a piece to get \"trapped\" in a way that the other piece isn't.\nFor $N=2$, the only way for a piece to get stuck is if all 2 or 3 of its neighbors are visited.\nIf rook is at (0,0), it has (0,1), (1,0) as neighbors. If these are visited, it's stuck.\nQueen at (0,0) has (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) as neighbors. If (0,1), (1,0) are visited, it still has (1,1) unvisited.\nSo, if the rook gets stuck, the queen will always have more options or same.\nThe only way for rook to pay less is if rook gets stuck, queen doesn't.\nThis means from current cell `C`, $R_{acc}(C) = \\emptyset$ but $Q_{acc}(C) \\ne \\emptyset$.\nThis is possible if all HV neighbors are visited, but a diagonal neighbor is not.\nLet's make this happen for $N=2$.\n1 at (0,0).\n2 at (0,1).\n3 at (1,0).\n4 at (1,1).\nRook: 1 (0,0) -> 2 (0,1) -> 3 (1,0).\nRook is at (1,0). $R_{acc}((1,0))$: (0,0) vis, (0,1) vis. (1,1) is not HV from (1,0). So $R_{acc}((1,0))$ is empty.\nUnvisited: {4 at (1,1)}. Rook pays 1 vun, teleports to 4. Rook vuns = 1.\nQueen: 1 (0,0) -> 2 (0,1) -> 3 (1,0).\nQueen is at (1,0). $Q_{acc}((1,0))$: (0,0) vis, (0,1) vis, (1,1) unvis. Min is 4 at (1,1).\nQueen moves to 4. Queen vuns = 0.\nThis works for $N=2$!\nBoard:\n1 2\n3 4\nRook vuns = 1. Queen vuns = 0.\nOh, I misunderstood my own trace for $N=2$ earlier.\nRook at (1,0), R_acc are (0,0) and (0,1). (1,1) is NOT R_acc. So it is stuck.\nThis board:\n1 2\n3 4\nshould work for $N=2$.\n\nSo my construction of filling odd/even cells is not needed for $N=2$, simple increasing numbers works.\nLet's re-evaluate my construction for $N=2$:\n3 1\n2 4\nRook vuns = 0, Queen vuns = 0.\nThis fails for $N=2$.\n\nThe board 1 2 / 3 4 works for $N=2$.\nRook: (0,0) 1 -> (0,1) 2 -> (1,0) 3. At (1,0). R_acc: (0,0) vis, (0,1) vis. Empty. Unvisited {4}. Rook pays 1 vun for 4. Total 1.\nQueen: (0,0) 1 -> (0,1) 2 -> (1,0) 3. At (1,0). Q_acc: (0,0) vis, (0,1) vis, (1,1) 4. Queen moves to 4. Total 0.\nThis works. So $N=2$ is not -1.\n\nWhat about $N=1$? Still -1.\nFor $N \\ge 2$:\nPrint numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2$ in reading order.\n`grid[i][j] = i*N + j + 1`.\nThis gives:\n1 2 3 ...
