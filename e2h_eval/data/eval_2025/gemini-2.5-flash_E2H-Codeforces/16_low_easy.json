Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for the \"Crazy Town\" Challenge**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Crazy Town\".  It seems straightforward enough, but let's break it down methodically. I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from a home block to a university block. The core constraint is that I can only move between blocks that share a common border, which means crossing a road (a line segment) of non-zero length.\n\nThe input is defined by the home and university coordinates, and a set of roads represented as linear equations `aix + biy + ci = 0`.  My initial thought is to visualize each road as a divider, splitting the plane into two regions. The key observation is that the sign of `aix + biy + ci` for a point `(x, y)` tells me which side of the line that point lies on.  If the sign changes between the home and university points, then a road separates them.\n\nMy strategy will be to iterate through each road, evaluating the expression `aix + biy + ci` for both the home and university coordinates. If the signs are different, that road represents a necessary step (a border crossed), so I'll increment my `steps` counter.  Since the problem guarantees that the home and university points do not lie on any road, I won't need to worry about the edge case where the expression evaluates to zero.\n\nEffectively, I'll count the number of roads that separate the home and university. This is the minimum number of steps required. I'll need to read in the input (home, university, and road parameters), calculate the value of the equation for each point and road, compare the signs, and accumulate the count.  Then I just output the total number of separating roads. Simple.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing home) to a target block (containing the university). A step is defined as moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. This means crossing exactly one road.\n\nEach road, defined by the equation `ax + by + c = 0`, divides the plane into two half-planes. For any point `(x, y)`, the value `ax + by + c` determines which side of the line the point lies on:\n*   If `ax + by + c > 0`, the point is on one side.\n*   If `ax + by + c < 0`, the point is on the other side.\n*   If `ax + by + c = 0`, the point is on the line itself. (The problem guarantees home and university are not on any road).\n\nTwo points are in the same block if and only if they lie on the same side of *every* road.\nIf the home and university are in different blocks, it means there is at least one road such that the home is on one side and the university is on the other side.\nTo move from the home block to the university block, one must cross every road that separates them. The minimum number of steps is simply the count of such separating roads.\n\nA road `ax + by + c = 0` separates two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` if and only if the values `ax1 + by1 + c` and `ax2 + by2 + c` have opposite signs. This can be checked by verifying if their product is negative: `(ax1 + by1 + c) * (ax2 + by2 + c) < 0`.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Read the coordinates of home `(x1, y1)` and university `(x2, y2)`.\n2.  Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n3.  Read the number of roads `n`.\n4.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read its coefficients `a, b, c`.\n    b.  Calculate `val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c`.\n    c.  Calculate `val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c`.\n    d.  If `val1` and `val2` have different signs (i.e., `val1 * val2 < 0`), increment `steps`.\n5.  Print the final `steps` count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    steps = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each road\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        \n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for home\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        \n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for university\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        \n        # If the values have different signs, the road separates home and university\n        # This means (val1 > 0 and val2 < 0) or (val1 < 0 and val2 > 0)\n        # Which is equivalent to val1 * val2 < 0\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            steps += 1\n            \n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
