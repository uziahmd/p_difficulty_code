On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "**My Approach to \"A Twisty Movement\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem. The core is an integer sequence of 1s and 2s, and we can reverse a subsegment to maximize the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS).  Since we're dealing with only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is pretty straightforward: it'll always be a sequence of 1s followed by a sequence of 2s. My goal is to maximize the *length* of that combined sequence.\n\nThe crucial insight is that we need to figure out where to \"split\" the sequence.  Let's say we have a split point *k*.  We can pick all the 1s *before* *k* and all the 2s *after* *k* to form our non-decreasing sequence.  So, I need to iterate through every possible split point, from the beginning to the end of the sequence. For each split, I'll calculate the number of 1s before the split point and the number of 2s after. The maximum sum across all splits will be the LNDS length.\n\nTo make things efficient, I'm thinking of pre-computing prefix sums for 1s and suffix sums for 2s. This allows me to quickly calculate the number of 1s before any index *k* and the number of 2s after any index *k*. This seems to create an `O(n)` solution for finding the LNDS length for a fixed sequence.\n\nNow, how do I apply the reversal?  I need to reverse a subsegment `[l, r]`. I can try reversing all possible subsegments and then computing the LNDS. For each reversal, I'll update the sequence and recompute the prefix and suffix sums for that modified array. I should be able to then maximize the LNDS length across all of these reversed sequences.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a Longest Non-decreasing Subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a chosen subsegment `a[l...r]` of the input array. The array elements are only 1s and 2s.\n\n**Key Observation for LNDS with only 1s and 2s:**\nA non-decreasing subsequence consisting only of 1s and 2s will always be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. To maximize its length, we want to include as many 1s as possible, followed by as many 2s as possible.\nFor any given array `A`, the length of its LNDS can be found by iterating through all possible \"split points\" `k` (where the 1s end and 2s begin). For each `k` (from `0` to `n`):\n1. Count the number of 1s in the prefix `A[0...k-1]`.\n2. Count the number of 2s in the suffix `A[k...n-1]`.\nThe sum of these two counts is a candidate for the LNDS length. The maximum such sum over all `k` gives the actual LNDS length.\nLet `count1[i]` be the number of 1s in `A[0...i-1]`.\nLet `count2[i]` be the number of 2s in `A[i...n-1]`.\nThe LNDS length is `max(count1[i] + count2[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n`.\n\n**Applying the Reversal:**\nWe need to choose `l` and `r` (1-indexed, so `a[l-1...r-1]` in 0-indexed) to reverse.\nA naive approach would be to iterate over all possible `l` and `r` pairs, perform the reversal, and then calculate the LNDS for each modified array. This would be `O(N^2)` pairs, each reversal taking `O(N)` time, and LNDS calculation taking `O(N)` time, leading to `O(N^4)` complexity, which is too slow for `N=2000`.\n\nWe can optimize the LNDS calculation after reversal.\nLet the original array be `A`. When we reverse `A[l-1...r-1]`, the array becomes `A[0...l-2] + reversed(A[l-1...r-1]) + A[r...n-1]`.\nLet's denote the counts of 1s and 2s in the original array:\n*   `ones_prefix[i]`: count of 1s in `A[0...i-1]`\n*   `twos_prefix[i]`: count of 2s in `A[0...i-1]`\n*   `ones_suffix[i]`: count of 1s in `A[i...n-1]`\n*   `twos_suffix[i]`: count of 2s in `A[i...n-1]`\n\nWhen we choose a split point `k` for the LNDS in the modified array, the 1s come from `A[0...k-1]` and 2s from `A[k...n-1]`.\nThere are three cases for the split point `k` relative to the reversed segment `[l-1, r-1]`:\n\n1.  **`k <= l-1`**: The split point is before the reversed segment.\n    The 1s are counted from `A[0...k-1]`. This is `ones_prefix[k]`.\n    The 2s are counted from `A[k...n-1]`. This segment might overlap with the reversed part.\n    The total 2s in the modified array from `k` onwards can be calculated as:\n    `(twos_prefix[l-1] - twos_prefix[k])` (2s in `A[k...l-2]`)\n    `+` `(ones_prefix[r] - ones_prefix[l-1])` (1s in `A[l-1...r-1]` become 2s in reversed segment)\n    `+` `twos_suffix[r]` (2s in `A[r...n-1]`)\n    So, `ones_prefix[k] + (twos_prefix[l-1] - twos_prefix[k]) + (ones_prefix[r] - ones_prefix[l-1]) + twos_suffix[r]`.\n\n2.  **`l-1 < k <= r`**: The split point is within the reversed segment.\n    The 1s are counted from `A[0...k-1]`. This includes `A[0...l-2]` and the first part of the reversed segment.\n    `ones_prefix[l-1]` (1s in `A[0...l-2]`)\n    `+` `(twos_prefix[r] - twos_prefix[k])` (2s in `A[k...r-1]` of *original* segment, which become 1s in *reversed* segment from `l-1` to `k-1`).\n    The 2s are counted from `A[k...n-1]`. This includes the latter part of the reversed segment and `A[r...n-1]`.\n    `(ones_prefix[k] - ones_prefix[l-1])` (1s in `A[l-1...k-1]` of *original* segment, which become 2s in *reversed* segment from `k` to `r-1`).\n    `+` `twos_suffix[r]` (2s in `A[r...n-1]`).\n    So, `ones_prefix[l-1] + (twos_prefix[r] - twos_prefix[k]) + (ones_prefix[k] - ones_prefix[l-1]) + twos_suffix[r]`.\n\n3.  **`k > r`**: The split point is after the reversed segment.\n    The 1s are counted from `A[0...k-1]`. This includes `A[0...l-2]`, the whole reversed segment, and `A[r...k-1]`.\n    `ones_prefix[l-1]` (1s in `A[0...l-2]`)\n    `+` `(twos_prefix[r] - twos_prefix[l-1])` (2s in `A[l-1...r-1]` of original segment, which become 1s in reversed segment)\n    `+` `(ones_prefix[k] - ones_prefix[r])` (1s in `A[r...k-1]`).\n    The 2s are counted from `A[k...n-1]`. This is `twos_suffix[k]`.\n    So, `ones_prefix[l-1] + (twos_prefix[r] - twos_prefix[l-1]) + (ones_prefix[k] - ones_prefix[r]) + twos_suffix[k]`.\n\nNotice that the sum for each `k` can be expressed as:\n`(count of 1s before l-1)`\n`+ (count of 1s in reversed [l-1, r-1] before split k)`\n`+ (count of 1s after r and before split k)`\n`+ (count of 2s in reversed [l-1, r-1] after split k)`\n`+ (count of 2s after r)`\nThis is equivalent to:\n`ones_prefix[l-1]` (1s before `l-1`)\n`+` `(twos_prefix[r] - twos_prefix[l-1])` (all 2s in `A[l-1...r-1]` become 1s)\n`+` `(ones_suffix[r] - ones_suffix[k])` (all 1s in `A[r...k-1]` become 1s)\n`+` `(ones_prefix[r] - ones_prefix[l-1])` (all 1s in `A[l-1...r-1]` become 2s)\n`+` `(twos_suffix[l-1] - twos_suffix[k])` (all 2s in `A[k...r-1]` become 2s)\n`+` `twos_suffix[r]` (2s after `r`)\n\nThis gets complicated quickly. A simpler approach is to realize that the contribution to the LNDS length from elements *outside* the `[l-1, r-1]` segment remains unchanged.\nThe total LNDS length for a given `l, r` and split point `k` is:\n`C1_left + C1_middle + C1_right + C2_left + C2_middle + C2_right`\nwhere `C1_X` are 1s and `C2_X` are 2s, from parts `[0, l-2]`, `[l-1, r-1]` (reversed), and `[r, n-1]` respectively, split by `k`.\n\nLet's precompute `prefix_ones[i]` (count of 1s in `A[0...i-1]`) and `suffix_twos[i]` (count of 2s in `A[i...n-1]`).\nThe original LNDS length is `max(prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n`. This is our initial `max_lnds`.\n\nNow, consider reversing `A[l-1...r-1]`.\nFor any split point `k`:\nThe number of 1s before `k` is `prefix_ones[l-1]` (1s in `A[0...l-2]`)\n`+` `(count of 1s in reversed A[l-1...r-1] before index k)`\n`+` `(count of 1s in A[r...k-1])`\nThe number of 2s after `k` is `(count of 2s in reversed A[l-1...r-1] after index k)`\n`+` `suffix_twos[r]` (2s in `A[r...n-1]`)\n\nThe key insight for this problem is that since `N` is up to 2000, `O(N^2)` is acceptable.\nWe can iterate over all possible `l` and `r` (`O(N^2)` pairs).\nFor each `(l, r)` pair:\n1.  Create a temporary array `B` which is a copy of `A`.\n2.  Reverse the segment `B[l-1...r-1]`. This takes `O(N)` time.\n3.  Calculate the LNDS of `B`. This takes `O(N)` time.\n    *   Precompute `prefix_ones_B[i]` and `suffix_twos_B[i]` for `B`.\n    *   Iterate `i` from `0` to `n` and find `max(prefix_ones_B[i] + suffix_twos_B[i])`.\nThis gives a total complexity of `O(N^2 * (N + N)) = O(N^4)`, which is too slow.\n\nThe LNDS calculation for a fixed `l, r` can be done in `O(N)` by precomputing prefix sums of 1s and suffix sums of 2s for the *original* array.\nLet `pref1[i]` be the count of 1s in `A[0...i-1]`.\nLet `suff2[i]` be the count of 2s in `A[i...n-1]`.\n\nFor a specific `l, r` and a split point `k`:\nThe number of 1s in `A'[0...k-1]` (where `A'` is the modified array):\n*   If `k <= l-1`: `pref1[k]`\n*   If `l-1 < k <= r`: `pref1[l-1]` (1s before `l-1`) + `(twos_in_original_segment[l-1...k-1])` (2s in original `A[l-1...k-1]` become 1s)\n    This is `pref1[l-1] + (twos_at_k - twos_at_l-1)`\n    where `twos_at_i` is the count of 2s in `A[0...i-1]`.\n*   If `k > r`: `pref1[l-1]` (1s before `l-1`) + `(twos_in_original_segment[l-1...r-1])` (all 2s in `A[l-1...r-1]` become 1s) + `(pref1[k] - pref1[r])` (1s in `A[r...k-1]`)\n\nThis is still complex. Let's simplify the LNDS calculation for fixed `l, r`.\nThe total number of 1s in the array is `total_ones`. The total number of 2s is `total_twos`.\nThe elements in `A[0...l-2]` and `A[r...n-1]` are fixed.\nThe elements in `A[l-1...r-1]` are reversed.\nLet `ones_in_segment = pref1[r] - pref1[l-1]`\nLet `twos_in_segment = (r - (l-1)) - ones_in_segment`\n\nWhen `A[l-1...r-1]` is reversed, all 1s within this segment become 2s in their new positions, and all 2s become 1s.\nSo, in the reversed segment:\n*   `ones_in_segment` original 1s become `ones_in_segment` 2s.\n*   `twos_in_segment` original 2s become `twos_in_segment` 1s.\n\nThe total number of 1s in the modified array is `(total_ones - ones_in_segment) + twos_in_segment`.\nThe total number of 2s in the modified array is `(total_twos - twos_in_segment) + ones_in_segment`.\n\nFor each `l, r` pair:\nIterate `k` from `0` to `n`. `k` is the split point.\n`num_1s = 0`\n`num_2s = 0`\n\n**Case 1: `k <= l-1` (split point before reversed segment)**\n`num_1s = pref1[k]`\n`num_2s = (twos_prefix[l-1] - twos_prefix[k])` (2s in `A[k...l-2]`)\n`+ twos_in_segment` (all 1s in `A[l-1...r-1]` become 2s)\n`+ (ones_in_segment)` (all 2s in `A[l-1...r-1]` become 1s) - This is incorrect.\n`+ (ones_in_segment)` (all 1s in `A[l-1...r-1]` become 2s) - This is incorrect.\n\nLet's go back to the definition: `max(count of 1s before k + count of 2s after k)`.\nFor a fixed `l, r`:\n`current_max_lnds = 0`\nFor `k` from `0` to `n`:\n  `count_1s_before_k = 0`\n  `count_2s_after_k = 0`\n\n  // Part 1: Elements before `l-1`\n  `count_1s_before_k += pref1[min(k, l-1)]`\n  `count_2s_after_k += suff2[max(k, r)]`\n\n  // Part 2: Elements in `[l-1, r-1]` (reversed)\n  If `k <= l-1`: // All of reversed segment contributes to 2s\n    `count_2s_after_k += (r - (l-1)) - (pref1[r] - pref1[l-1])` // 2s in original segment become 1s (incorrect)\n    `count_2s_after_k += (pref1[r] - pref1[l-1])` // 1s in original segment become 2s\n  Else if `k > r`: // All of reversed segment contributes to 1s\n    `count_1s_before_k += (r - (l-1)) - (pref1[r] - pref1[l-1])` // 2s in original segment become 1s\n  Else (`l-1 < k <= r`): // Split point is inside reversed segment\n    // 1s from reversed segment: original 2s in `A[l-1...k-1]`\n    `count_1s_before_k += (k - (l-1)) - (pref1[k] - pref1[l-1])`\n    // 2s from reversed segment: original 1s in `A[k...r-1]`\n    `count_2s_after_k += (pref1[r] - pref1[k])`\n\n  // Part 3: Elements after `r`\n  // These are implicitly handled by `pref1[min(k, l-1)]` and `suff2[max(k, r)]` if `k` is outside the segment.\n  // We need to be careful with double counting or missing.\n\nLet's define `pref1[i]` as count of 1s in `A[0...i-1]` and `pref2[i]` as count of 2s in `A[0...i-1]`.\nSimilarly, `suff1[i]` as count of 1s in `A[i...n-1]` and `suff2[i]` as count of 2s in `A[i...n-1]`.\n\nFor a specific `l, r` and a split point `k`:\n`current_1s = 0`\n`current_2s = 0`\n\n**1.

There must be a simpler `O(N^2)` solution.\nThe `O(N^2)` must come from iterating `l` and `r`. The LNDS calculation itself must be `O(1)` or `O(log N)` for each `l, r`. This is impossible without more specific structure.\n\nThe simplified LNDS calculation:\nFor an array `B`, LNDS is `max_k ( (count of 1s in B[0...k-1]) + (count of 2s in B[k...n-1]) )`.\nLet `A_prefix_ones[i]` be the count of 1s in `A[0...i-1]`.\nLet `A_suffix_twos[i]` be the count of 2s in `A[i...n-1]`.\n\nThe maximum LNDS for any `l, r` is the maximum value of:\n`A_prefix_ones[l-1]` (1s before `l`)\n`+ (count of 1s in reversed A[l-1...r-1] before split k)`\n`+ (count of 1s in A[r...k-1])`\n`+ (count of 2s in reversed A[l-1...r-1] after split k)`\n`+ A_suffix_twos[r]` (2s after `r`)\n\nLet's fix `l`.

The change is `+1` if `A[i]=1`, `i>=k` and `-1` if `A[i]=2`, `i>=k`).\n\nLet `change[i]` be `1` if `A[i]==2` and `-1` if `A[i]==1`.\nFor `i` in `[l, r]`:\n*   If `i < k`: `change[i]` is added to the total `delta`.\n*   If `i >= k`: `-change[i]` is added to the total `delta`.\n\nSo, for fixed `l, r, k`:\n`delta = sum_{i=l}^{min(r, k-1)} change[i] + sum_{i=max(l, k)}^{r} (-change[i])`\nThis can be calculated using prefix sums of `change` array.\nLet `pref_change[x] = sum_{i=0}^{x-1} change[i]`.\nThen `sum_{i=a}^{b} change[i] = pref_change[b+1] - pref_change[a]`.\n\n`delta = (pref_change[min(r, k-1)+1] - pref_change[l])`\n`+ (-(pref_change[r+1] - pref_change[max(l, k)]))`\n\nThis `delta` can be calculated in `O(1)` for each `l, r, k`.\nTotal `O(N^3)`. Still not `O(N^2)`.\n\nThe part `max_{k} (P1[k] + S2[k] + delta(l,r,k))` needs to be `O(1)` or `O(N)` total for all `k` when `l,r` are varied.\nThe `P1[k] + S2[k]` part is fixed for all `l,r`.\nLet `f(k) = P1[k] + S2[k]`.\nWe need to maximize `f(k) + delta(l,r,k)`.\nFor a fixed `l`, iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\nWhen `r` increases to `r+1`, `A[r]` is added to the reversed segment.\nThis changes `delta(l,r,k)`.\nThe new `delta(l, r+1, k)` is `delta(l, r, k)` plus the contribution of `A[r]`.\nContribution of `A[r]` depends on `k` relative to `r`.\n*   If `r < k`: `change[r]` is added.\n*   If `r >= k`: `-change[r]` is added.\n\nThis suggests that for a fixed `l`, as `r` increases, we can update the `delta` values for all `k` in `O(1)`.\nThis still leaves `O(N)` for iterating `k` for each `l, r`.\n`O(N^2)` pairs of `(l,r)`, `O(N)` for `k` means `O(N^3)`.\n\nThe trick for `O(N^2)` must be that for a fixed `l`, as `r` goes from `l` to `n-1`, we can find `max_k (f(k) + delta(l,r,k))` faster than `O(N)`.\nLet `g_r(k) = f(k) + delta(l,r,k)`.\n`delta(l,r,k) = (pref_change[min(r, k-1)+1] - pref_change[l]) - (pref_change[r+1] - pref_change[max(l, k)])`.\nThis is a sum of prefix sums.\nThis `g_r(k)` can be seen as two parts:\n1.  `f(k) + sum_{i=l}^{k-1} change[i] - sum_{i=k}^{r} change[i]` (if `l <= k <= r`)\n2.  `f(k) + sum_{i=l}^{r} change[i]` (if `k > r`)\n3.  `f(k) - sum_{i=l}^{r} change[i]` (if `k <= l`)\n\nThis structure is reminiscent of \"max subarray sum\" or similar problems that can be solved with a sliding window or a monotonic queue/stack.\nFor fixed `l`, `r`:\n`f(k) + (pref_change[k] - pref_change[l]) - (pref_change[r+1] - pref_change[k])` for `l < k <= r`.\n`f(k) + 2*pref_change[k] - pref_change[l] - pref_change[r+1]`\nThis is `A_k + B_r` type of expression where `A_k = f(k) + 2*pref_change[k]` and `B_r = -pref_change[l] - pref_change[r+1]`.\nThis is only for `l < k <= r`. The other cases are also sums/differences of prefix sums.\n\nFor fixed `l`, as `r` increases:\nThe segment `[l...r]` grows.\nWe need to find `max_{k}` of three types of expressions:\n1. `max_{0 <= k <= l} (f(k) - (pref_change[r+1] - pref_change[l]))`\n2. `max_{l < k <= r} (f(k) + 2*pref_change[k] - pref_change[l] - pref_change[r+1])`\n3. `max_{r < k <= n} (f(k) + (pref_change[r+1] - pref_change[l]))`\n\nLet `C_l = -pref_change[l]`.\nFor case 1: `max_{0 <= k <= l} f(k) + C_l - pref_change[r+1]`\nThis is `(max_{0 <= k <= l} f(k) + C_l) - pref_change[r+1]`. The `max` part is constant for fixed `l`.\nFor case 3: `max_{r < k <= n} f(k) + pref_change[r+1] + C_l`\nThis is `(max_{r < k <= n} f(k) + pref_change[r+1]) + C_l`. The `max` part needs to be updated as `r` changes.\nFor case 2: `max_{l < k <= r} (f(k) + 2*pref_change[k]) + C_l - pref_change[r+1]`\nThis is `(max_{l < k <= r} (f(k) + 2*pref_change[k])) + C_l - pref_change[r+1]`. The `max` part needs to be updated as `r` changes.\n\nFor fixed `l`:\n`max_f_prefix[j] = max_{0<=k<=j} f(k)`\n`max_f_suffix[j] = max_{j<=k<=n} f(k)`\n`max_f_plus_2pc_prefix[j] = max_{0<=k<=j} (f(k) + 2*pref_change[k])`\n\nFor case 1: `max_f_prefix[l] + C_l - pref_change[r+1]`. This is `O(1)` to compute.\nFor case 3: `max_{r < k <= n} f(k) + pref_change[r+1] + C_l`. This is `S_f[r+1]` (suffix max).\nFor case 2: `max_{l < k <= r} (f(k) + 2*pref_change[k]) + C_l - pref_change[r+1]`. This is `P_f2pc[r] - P_f2pc[l]` (range max).\n\nWe need to compute range maximum queries. A segment tree can do this in `O(log N)`.\nSo for each `l, r` pair, `O(log N)` for LNDS calculation. Total `O(N^2 log N)`. This is feasible.\n`2000^2 * log(2000) approx 4*10^6 * 11 = 4.4*10^7`.\n\nLet's refine the `O(N^2 log N)` approach.\nPrecompute `f[k] = P1[k] + S2[k]` for `k=0...n`.\nPrecompute `change[i]` for `i=0...n-1`. `pref_change[i]` for `i=0...n`.\nBuild a segment tree over `k=0...n` storing `f(k) + 2*pref_change[k]`.\nBuild a segment tree over `k=0...n` storing `f(k)`.\n\n`max_overall_lnds = 0`\nFor `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n  For `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n    `current_max_lnds = 0`\n    `C_l = -pref_change[l]`\n\n    // Case 1: `0 <= k <= l`\n    If `l >= 0`:\n      `val1 = query_max_f(0, l)` // max of `f(k)` for `0 <= k <= l`\n      `current_max_lnds = max(current_max_lnds, val1 + C_l - pref_change[r+1])`\n\n    // Case 2: `l < k <= r`\n    If `l < r`:\n      `val2 = query_max_f_plus_2pc(l+1, r)` // max of `f(k) + 2*pref_change[k]` for `l < k <= r`\n      `current_max_lnds = max(current_max_lnds, val2 + C_l - pref_change[r+1])`\n\n    // Case 3: `r < k <= n`\n    If `r < n-1`:\n      `val3 = query_max_f(r+1, n)` // max of `f(k)` for `r < k <= n`\n      `current_max_lnds = max(current_max_lnds, val3 + pref_change[r+1] + C_l)`\n\n    `max_overall_lnds = max(max_overall_lnds, current_max_lnds)`\n\nThe base `max_overall_lnds` should be initialized with the LNDS of the original array (i.e. `max_overall_lnds = max_k f(k)`).\nThis is still `O(N^2 log N)`.\n\nWhat if it's `O(N^2)`?\nFor fixed `l`, as `r` increases:\n`current_max_lnds` needs to be updated.\nCase 1: `max_{0 <= k <= l} f(k) + C_l - pref_change[r+1]`\n    `pref_change[r+1]` is decreasing.
