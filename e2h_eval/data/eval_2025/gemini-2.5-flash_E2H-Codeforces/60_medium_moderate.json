Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts on Decoding Binary Strings and Counting Sequences**\n\nAlright, so the problem's got me thinking. I need a Python solution for a competitive programming challenge. It's all about this binary string `S` that grows over time. The goal is to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that you can create by decoding substrings of `S`, and report this count after each string modification (append operation). The answer needs to stay within `10^9 + 7`.\n\nFirst, let's establish the rules: \"0\" is a dot, and \"1\" is a dash in Morse code. Each English letter is represented by a string of 1 to 4 characters. There are a total of 30 possible strings (2 + 4 + 8 + 16), but only 26 of them are valid English letters. The 4 invalid strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\") need to be excluded.  The main task is to handle substring processing and sequence formation efficiently given dynamic changes to `S`.\n\nLet's break down a simple example, `S = \"111\"`. The substrings are \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\". \"1\" might decode to 'T', \"11\" to 'M', and \"111\" to 'O'.  I need to consider all possible sequences of these letters – \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". This adds up to 7, which checks out with the problem description.\n\nThe challenge is to find a smart way to process these substrings and create and keep track of all valid sequences, which suggests a dynamic programming (DP) approach.\n\nI initially thought that `dp[i]` could be the count of sequences formed with `S[i:]`. But that’s not quite it. I'm dealing with substrings. Then, I considered DP using substrings to derive the number of sequences formed by decoding `S[i:j]`, which involves string processing.\n\nThe substrings can be broken up into a series of smaller substrings, so I need to count the *number of ways to decode* a substring into a sequence, which led to a recursive DP (let `g[k]` represent number of ways of decoding from position `k`).\n\nNow, I was initially worried about having to examine every possible substring (`O(N^2)`), where `N` is length of `S`, and processing each substring taking `O(N)` leading to a super slow `O(N^3)` algorithm, but after noticing the maximum length is only four, I realized that I could calculate `f(sub)` only with the last four characters.\n\nThe append operations make the dynamic aspect even more challenging. Since the string `S` grows by one character at a time, I should think about an iterative solution.  So, I need to update my count with each character added.\n\nI need to calculate the value after each character append and the key is to update the result instead of starting from scratch. Let `total_answer` track the total count. When I append character `c`, the new substrings end at the last index. For substrings `S[j:N]`, calculate the count (say `f(S[j:N])`) and add it to `total_answer`. Let `dp[i]` be the ways to decode suffix `S[i:]`. Then `g[k]` is the count starting from `S[j+k]`, where `j` is the starting point of the substring. I came up with an update function `f(S') = total_ans + (sum of the sequences of all ending substrings)`.\n\nSince the longest Morse code is of length four, the computation of `g[k]` only depends on `g[k+1], g[k+2], g[k+3], and g[k+4]`.  So I could optimize the count.\n\nI realized I can keep track of the counts efficiently by maintaining `dp[k]` representing the number of decoding ways starting at position `k`.\n\nSo, the optimal approach to tackle this is to do dynamic programming for each substring with an accumulator to maintain the updated result for an `O(m * n)` time complexity where `m` is the total number of appends.\nLet `dp[k]` represent the ways of decoding `S[k:]` (including empty sequence).\nFor the current string `S`, at index `k`:\nIterate `length` from 1 to 4:\nIf `S[k: k+length]` is valid (not in the invalid codes):\n`dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+length])",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the total number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding *any* substring of a dynamically growing string `S`. We need to report this count modulo `10^9 + 7` after each character is appended to `S`.\n\nLet's first define what constitutes a valid Morse code. A Morse code is a string of '0's and '1's of length 1 to 4. There are `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 30` such strings. Out of these, 4 are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". The remaining 26 strings correspond to distinct English letters.\n\nLet `S` be the current string of length `N`. We are interested in all its substrings `S[i:j]` (where `0 <= i < j <= N`). For each such substring, we need to find the number of non-empty sequences of English letters it can represent.\n\nLet `count_sequences(substring)` be a function that returns the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that `substring` can represent. This can be computed using dynamic programming:\nLet `dp_sub[k]` be the number of ways to decode the prefix `substring[0:k]` into a sequence of English letters.\n*   `dp_sub[0] = 1` (representing an empty sequence for an empty prefix).\n*   For `k` from `1` to `len(substring)`:\n    *   `dp_sub[k] = 0`\n    *   For `length` in `1, 2, 3, 4`:\n        *   If `k - length >= 0` (i.e., `substring[k-length:k]` is a valid prefix of `substring`):\n            *   Let `code = substring[k-length:k]`.\n            *   If `code` is a valid Morse code (length 1-4 and not one of the 4 invalid codes):\n                *   `dp_sub[k] = (dp_sub[k] + dp_sub[k-length]) % MOD`.\nThe total number of non-empty sequences for `substring` is `dp_sub[len(substring)]`. (The `dp_sub[0]=1` base case correctly accounts for concatenating a new letter with previous sequences, and `dp_sub[len(substring)]` will include only non-empty sequences because `dp_sub[0]` is only used when a valid code is found).\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of `count_sequences(S[i:j])` for all `0 <= i < j <= N`.\nA naive approach would be to iterate through all `O(N^2)` substrings, and for each, compute `count_sequences` in `O(length)` time, leading to `O(N^3)` for each step, which is too slow for `N=3000`.\n\nWe need a more efficient approach that leverages the fact that `S` grows by one character at a time.\nLet `S_prev` be the string before appending a new character `c`, and `S_curr = S_prev + c` be the new string.\nThe total count for `S_curr` will be the total count for `S_prev` plus the count of sequences formed by new substrings.\nThe new substrings are those that *end* at the newly appended character `c`. These are `S_curr[N-1:N]`, `S_curr[N-2:N]`, ..., `S_curr[0:N]`, where `N` is the new length of `S_curr`.\n\nLet's maintain a DP array, `dp[k]`, which stores `count_sequences(S[k:N])` for the current string `S` of length `N`.\nMore precisely, let `dp[k]` be the number of ways to decode the suffix `S[k:]` into sequences of letters.\n*   `dp[N] = 1` (representing the empty sequence for an empty suffix `S[N:]`).\n*   For `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    *   `dp[k] = 0`\n    *   For `length` in `1, 2, 3, 4`:\n        *   If `k + length <= N`:\n            *   Let `code = S[k:k+length]`.\n            *   If `code` is a valid Morse code:\n                *   `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+length]) % MOD`.\n\nAfter computing `dp` for the current `S` of length `N`:\nThe number of non-empty sequences for a substring `S[k:N]` (which ends at `N-1`) is `(dp[k] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`.\nThe sum of new sequences contributed by substrings ending at `N-1` is `sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (dp[k] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`.\n\nLet `total_overall_ans` be the cumulative sum of `count_sequences(S[i:j])` for all substrings `S[i:j]` up to the current `S`.\nWhen a new character is appended:\n1.  Append `char` to `S`. Let `N` be the new length.\n2.  Compute the `dp` array for `S`. `dp[N]=1`, then iterate `k` from `N-1` down to `0`.\n3.  Calculate `current_step_contribution = sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (dp[k] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`. This sum represents all non-empty sequences that can be formed by substrings of `S` that *end* at the current last character (index `N-1`).\n4.  Add `current_step_contribution` to `total_overall_ans`.\n5.  Print `total_overall_ans`.\n\nThis approach calculates the `dp` array of size `N` in `O(N * 4)` time, and then sums up `N` values. So, each step takes `O(N)` time. Since `N` goes up to `m`, the total time complexity will be `O(m^2)`.\nGiven `m <= 3000`, `m^2 = 9 * 10^6`, which is efficient enough.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: `S = \"111\"`**\n\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n`S = \"\"`\n`total_overall_ans = 0`\n`dp = [0] * (m + 5)` (to store `dp[k]` values, `m+1` for current length, `+4` for `k+length`)\n\n**1.

This means \"1\" can be decoded as an empty sequence (from `dp[1]`) plus any other sequences. If `S=\"1\"`, it only decodes to \"T\". So `dp[0]` should be 2 to represent \"T\" and empty. Then `dp[0]-1` would be 1.\n  The issue is how `dp[k]` is defined. If `dp[k]` is the number of ways to decode `S[k:]` into sequences, and `dp[N]` is 1 for the empty sequence, then `dp[k]` will always be at least 1 (because it can always lead to an empty sequence if `S[k:]` can be fully decoded).\n  The correct interpretation of `dp[k]` in this context is: `dp[k]` is the number of *additional* ways to form sequences using `S[k:]` *starting with a letter*.\n  Let's redefine `dp[k]` as the number of non-empty sequences that can be formed using `S[k:]`.\n  `dp[N] = 0` (empty suffix `S[N:]` forms 0 non-empty sequences).\n  For `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp[k] = 0`\n    For `length` in `1, 2, 3, 4`:\n      If `k + length <= N`:\n        `code = S[k:k+length]`.\n        If `code` is a valid Morse code:\n          `dp[k] = (dp[k] + 1) % MOD` (for `code` itself as a single letter sequence)\n          `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+length]) % MOD` (for `code` followed by sequences from `S[k+length:]`)\n\nLet's trace with this new `dp` definition:\n`S = \"1\"`, `N = 1`\n`dp[1] = 0`\n`k = 0`:\n  `dp[0] = 0`\n  `length = 1`: `S[0:1] = \"1\"`.

Decodes to \"T\". Count = 1.\n`total_overall_ans = 1`.\n\nFor `S = \"11\"`, substrings: `S[0:1]` (\"1\"), `S[1:2]` (\"1\"), `S[0:2]` (\"11\").\n`count_sequences(\"1\")` = 1 (\"T\").\n`count_sequences(\"11\")` = 2 (\"M\", \"TT\").\nTotal distinct sequences: \"T\" (from `S[0:1]`), \"T\" (from `S[1:2]`), \"M\" (from `S[0:2]`), \"TT\" (from `S[0:2]`).\nThe problem asks for *number of non-empty sequences of English letters*. This means if \"T\" is formed from `S[0:1]` and also from `S[1:2]`, it's still just one sequence \"T\".\nThis implies we need to count *distinct* sequences. This is much harder.\n\n\"All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.\"\nThis wording means we need to collect all possible sequences from all substrings and then count the unique ones.\nThis is typically solved using a Trie or a hash set.\nSince `M` is 3000, `S` can be 3000 characters long.\nA sequence of letters can be up to `M` letters long (e.g., `S = \"000...0\"` decodes to `A A A ... A`).\nThe number of distinct sequences can be very large.\nFor `S=\"111\"`, the example lists: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\nThese are 7 distinct sequences.\n\nThis changes the problem significantly. `O(M^2)` DP will compute the sum of `count_sequences(sub)` for all `sub`. If we want distinct sequences, we need a different approach.\n\nLet `dp[i]` be the set of unique sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[0:i]`. This is also not quite right.\nWe need to count `| U_{0 <= i < j <= N} Sequences(S[i:j]) |`.\n\nLet `current_sequences` be a set of all unique sequences found so far.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`, let `S_new = S + c`.\nWe need to find all sequences `L_1 L_2 ... L_p` that can be formed by decoding `S_new[k:N]` for `0 <= k < N`.\nFor each `k`, we can form `S_new[k:N]` into `L_1 ... L_p`.\nLet `dp_suffix[idx]` be a set of sequences that can be formed by `S_new[idx:]`.\n`dp_suffix[N]` = `{\" \"}` (empty sequence).\nFor `idx` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_suffix[idx] = set()`\n  For `length` in `1, 2, 3, 4`:\n    If `idx + length <= N`:\n      `code = S_new[idx : idx+length]`.\n      If `code` is a valid Morse code:\n        `letter = decode_morse(code)` (map '0'->'A', '1'->'T' etc.)\n        For `seq` in `dp_suffix[idx+length]`:\n          `dp_suffix[idx].add(letter + seq)`\nThen, for each `idx` from `0` to `N-1`, add all sequences in `dp_suffix[idx]` to `current_sequences`.\nThis is too slow and memory intensive. `M=3000`, sequence length up to 3000.\n`dp_suffix[idx]` can contain many sequences.\n\nThe modulo arithmetic typically implies counting, not distinct elements in a set.\nThe phrase \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters\" usually means \"sum of ways to form sequences\".\nLet's re-read the example's explanation carefully:\n\"All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.\n  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\"\nThis list explicitly shows 7 distinct sequences.\nIf the problem meant \"sum of ways\", then for \"111\":\n`f(\"1\") = 1` (\"T\")\n`f(\"11\") = 2` (\"M\", \"TT\")\n`f(\"111\") = 4` (\"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\")\nTotal sum for `S=\"111\"` would be `f(\"1\")` (from `S[0:1]`) + `f(\"1\")` (from `S[1:2]`) + `f(\"1\")` (from `S[2:3]`) + `f(\"11\")` (from `S[0:2]`) + `f(\"11\")` (from `S[1:3]`) + `f(\"111\")` (from `S[0:3]`)\n`= 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 11`. This is not 7.\n\nThe only way to get 7 is if we count distinct sequences.\n\"T\" appears 3 times (from `S[0:1]`, `S[1:2]`, `S[2:3]`). Counted once.\n\"M\" appears 2 times (from `S[0:2]`, `S[1:3]`).

Counted once.\nTotal: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 7.\n\nThis confirms that we need to count *distinct* sequences.\nThis makes the problem significantly harder.\nTo count distinct sequences, we can use a Trie (prefix tree). Each node in the Trie represents a unique sequence of letters.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended to `S`:\nLet `N` be the new length of `S`.\nWe are interested in substrings `S[k:N]` for `0 <= k < N`.\nFor each `k`, we need to find all sequences `L_1 L_2 ... L_p` that `S[k:N]` can represent.\nWe can do this with DP. Let `dp_sets[idx]` be a set of sequences (represented as tuples of characters for hashing) that `S[idx:N]` can form.\n`dp_sets[N] = {()}` (empty tuple for empty sequence).\nFor `idx` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_sets[idx] = set()`\n  For `length` in `1, 2, 3, 4`:\n    If `idx + length <= N`:\n      `code = S[idx : idx+length]`.\n      If `code` is a valid Morse code:\n        `letter = get_char_for_code(code)` (e.g., 'A', 'B', ...)\n        For `seq_tuple` in `dp_sets[idx+length]`:\n          `new_seq_tuple = (letter,) + seq_tuple`\n          `dp_sets[idx].add(new_seq_tuple)`\nAfter computing all `dp_sets[idx]`, we iterate `k` from `0` to `N-1`. For each `seq_tuple` in `dp_sets[k]`:\n  If `seq_tuple` is not empty, add it to a global `all_distinct_sequences` set.\nFinally, print `len(all_distinct_sequences) % MOD`.\n\nThis approach is likely too slow and memory intensive.\n`M=3000`. Max string length 3000.\nNumber of substrings `O(M^2)`.\nEach `dp_sets[idx]` could potentially store `2^4` sequences.\nThe number of distinct sequences could be `O(M^2 * 2^4)`.\nTotal number of sequences could be huge. Storing them in a set of tuples is too much.\nE.g., `S = \"0000\"`.\n`S[0:1]` -> \"A\"\n`S[0:2]` -> \"B\", \"AA\"\n`S[0:3]` -> \"C\", \"BA\", \"AB\", \"AAA\"\n`S[0:4]` -> \"D\", \"CA\", \"BC\", \"ACB\", \"AAB\", \"ABA\", \"BAA\", \"AAAA\"\nThe number of sequences grows exponentially with length.\n\nThe constraints `M=3000` and modulo `10^9+7` strongly suggest an `O(M^2)` or `O(M log M)` solution that involves counting, not storing actual strings.\nIf it's about counting, the example's \"7\" is very misleading.\nUnless there's a property of Morse codes that limits distinct sequences, this is an issue.\n\nLet's assume the example is just showing the *type* of sequences, and the actual task is to sum the number of ways, not distinct sequences.\nIf it was sum of ways:\n`S=\"1\"`: `f(\"1\")=1`. `total_overall_ans=1`.\n`S=\"11\"`: `f(\"1\")=1`, `f(\"11\")=2`. Substrings: `S[0:1]`, `S[1:2]`, `S[0:2]`.\nSum of `f(sub)`: `f(S[0:1]) + f(S[1:2]) + f(S[0:2]) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.\nOutput for `S=\"11\"` should be 4. But example says 3.\nThis means my interpretation of \"sum of ways\" is also wrong.\n\nThe only way the example output `1, 3, 7` makes sense is if it's counting distinct sequences.\n`S=\"1\"`: {\"T\"}. Count = 1.\n`S=\"11\"`: Substrings: \"1\", \"11\".\n  `S[0:1]` -> \"T\"\n  `S[1:2]` -> \"T\"\n  `S[0:2]` -> \"M\", \"TT\"\nDistinct sequences: {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"}. Count = 3.\n`S=\"111\"`: Substrings: \"1\", \"11\", \"111\".\n  `S[0:1]` -> \"T\"\n  `S[1:2]` -> \"T\"\n  `S[2:3]` -> \"T\"\n  `S[0:2]` -> \"M\", \"TT\"\n  `S[1:3]` -> \"M\", \"TT\"\n  `S[0:3]` -> \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\nDistinct sequences: {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}. Count = 7.\nThis matches the example output exactly. So we must count distinct sequences.\n\nThis implies using Aho-Corasick or a similar string matching automaton, but for sequences of letters.\nA Trie is the standard way to count distinct strings.\nTo avoid storing actual sequences, we can store their hashes. But hash collisions are a concern with modulo arithmetic.\nA common competitive programming trick for counting distinct paths in a DAG (which is what decoding strings is) is to use polynomial hashing for the paths.\nA sequence of letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_p` can be hashed as `(L_1 * P^(p-1) + L_2 * P^(p-2) + ... + L_p * P^0) % MOD_H`.\nWe'd need two different prime moduli and bases to reduce collision probability.\n\nLet's use a Trie of sequences. Each node in the Trie represents a unique sequence prefix.\nWhen we append `c` to `S`, let `N` be the new length.\nWe need to calculate `dp_sequences[idx]` for `idx = N-1` down to `0`.\n`dp_sequences[idx]` will be a list of `(hash1, hash2, length)` tuples, representing the unique sequences that `S[idx:N]` can form.\n`dp_sequences[N]` is an empty list (representing empty sequence).\nFor `idx` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `current_sequences_for_suffix = set()` (stores `(hash1, hash2, length)` tuples)\n  For `length` in `1, 2, 3, 4`:\n    If `idx + length <= N`:\n      `code = S[idx : idx+length]`.\n      If `code` is a valid Morse code:\n        `letter_char = get_char_for_code(code)`\n        `letter_val = ord(letter_char) - ord('A') + 1` (assign integer values 1-26)\n        For `(h1_suffix, h2_suffix, len_suffix)` in `dp_sequences[idx+length]`:\n          `new_h1 = (letter_val * P1^(len_suffix) + h1_suffix) % MOD1`\n          `new_h2 = (letter_val * P2^(len_suffix) + h2_suffix) % MOD2`\n          `new_len = 1 + len_suffix`\n          `current_sequences_for_suffix.add((new_h1, new_h2, new_len))`\n  `dp_sequences[idx] = list(current_sequences_for_suffix)`\nAfter computing all `dp_sequences[idx]`, iterate `k` from `0` to `N-1`. For each `(h1, h2, len)` in `dp_sequences[k]`:\n  If `len > 0`, add `(h1, h2, len)` to a global `all_distinct_sequences` set.\nPrint `len(all_distinct_sequences) % MOD`.\n\nThis still stores many hash tuples.\nThe number of distinct sequences for `S[k:N]` can be large.\n`S=\"0000...\"` of length 3000. `S[0:4]` has 8 sequences. `S[0:5]` would have more.\nThe number of sequences can be exponential in length.\n`f(L) = f(L-1) + f(L-2) + f(L-3) + f(L-4)`. This is a Fibonacci-like sequence.\nIf all codes of length 1 to 4 are valid, `f(L)` grows exponentially.\n`f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=4, f(4)=8, f(5)=15, ...`\nSo, `dp_sequences[idx]` can contain `O(2^(N-idx))` elements.\nThis is definitely too slow.\n\nCould it be that the valid codes are chosen such that the number of distinct sequences is small?\nThe problem text: \"each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter\". This means the mapping `code -> letter` is unique.\n\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\" are invalid.\nThis means we can't form all possible sequences.\nE.g., \"0011\" itself cannot be decoded.\n\nLet's list the valid lengths: 1, 2, 3, 4.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences from a substring of length `L` is `F(L+1)` (Fibonacci sequence `F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, ...` where `F(L+1)` is the number of ways to tile a `1xL` strip with `1x1` or `1x2` tiles, etc.).\nFor length 4, `F(5) = 5` if only length 1 and 2 are allowed.\nIf all lengths 1-4 are allowed, let `T(L)` be the number of ways to decode string of length `L`.\n`T(0)=1` (empty string)\n`T(1)=T(0)=1`\n`T(2)=T(1)+T(0)=2`\n`T(3)=T(2)+T(1)+T(0)=4`\n`T(4)=T(3)+T(2)+T(1)+T(0)=8`\n`T(L) = T(L-1)+T(L-2)+T(L-3)+T(L-4)` for `L>=4`.\nThis grows exponentially. `T(3000)` is enormous.\nThe number of distinct sequences will be at most `T(L)`.\n\nThe only way `M^2` works for distinct counting is if the number of distinct sequences is bounded by `M` or `log M`.\nThis is a standard problem, sometimes called \"counting distinct paths in a DAG\" or \"counting distinct strings on Aho-Corasick\".\nThe \"Trie of hashes\" approach is the most common for this.\nThe number of distinct sequences can be up to `M * 4` (each character appended leads to 4 new sequences, roughly). But this is wrong.\nThe problem is tricky because it's a competitive programming problem, and the example is given. The example output is `1, 3, 7`.\nThis is exactly the sequence `T(1), T(2), T(3)` for `S=\"111\"` if `T(L)` is defined as the number of ways to decode `S[0:L]` using `1` and `11` and `111` as valid codes.\nFor `S=\"111\"`:\n`S[0:1]=\"1\"`: `T`\n`S[0:2]=\"11\"`: `M`, `TT`\n`S[0:3]=\"111\"`: `O`, `TM`, `MT`, `TTT`\nTotal distinct sequences: `T, M, TT, O, TM, MT, TTT`. Count = 7.\nThis means for `S_k`, the answer is `| U_{j=0}^{k-1} Sequences(S_k[j:k]) |`.\nNo, it's `| U_{0 <= i < j <= k} Sequences(S_k[i:j]) |`.\n\nLet's re-read the first sample.\n`S=\"1\"`: `total_ans = 1`\n`S=\"11\"`: `total_ans = 3`\n`S=\"111\"`: `total_ans = 7`\nThis looks like `2^N - 1` for `N=1,2,3`.\n`2^1-1 = 1`.\n`2^2-1 = 3`.\n`2^3-1 = 7`.\nThis is a specific pattern. Why `2^N-1`?\nIt means for `S = \"11...1\"` (N ones), all substrings are `1, 11, 111, ...`.\n`f(\"1\") = 1` (\"T\")\n`f(\"11\") = 2` (\"M\", \"TT\")\n`f(\"111\") = 4` (\"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\")\n`f(\"1111\") = 8` (\"P\", \"Q\", \"R\", ...)\nIf `S` is all '1's, then `S[i:j]` is also all '1's.\nThe characters 'T', 'M', 'O', 'P' (length 1,2,3,4 codes made of '1's) are distinct.\nThe sequences formed by `S[i:j]` are unique because the structure `L_1...L_k` is unique.\nIf `S = \"111\"`, all substrings are `1`, `11`, `111`.\n`S[0:1]` = \"1\" -> \"T\"\n`S[1:2]` = \"1\" -> \"T\"\n`S[2:3]` = \"1\" -> \"T\"\n`S[0:2]` = \"11\" -> \"M\", \"TT\"\n`S[1:3]` = \"11\" -> \"M\", \"TT\"\n`S[0:3]` = \"111\" -> \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\nThe set of distinct sequences is `{\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}`. Count = 7.\nThis pattern `2^N-1` is just `T(N)-1` where `T(N)` is the number of ways to decode string of length `N` using only '1', '11', '111' as valid codes.\n`T(0)=1`\n`T(1)=T(0)=1` (for \"1\")\n`T(2)=T(1)+T(0)=2` (for \"11\")\n`T(3)=T(2)+T(1)+T(0)=4` (for \"111\")\nSo `T(N)` is actually `2^(N-1)` for `N>=1` with this specific set of codes.\nThe number of sequences generated by `S[0:L]` is `2^(L-1)`.\nThe question is about the *union* of all these sets.\nThe example output for `S=\"111\"` (7) is `T(3)-1` where `T(L)` is the number of ways to decode `S[0:L]` using the specific valid codes `1, 11, 111`.\nThis implies that for `S=\"111\"`, the distinct sequences are exactly those generated by `S[0:1]`, `S[0:2]`, `S[0:3]`.\nThis means `Sequences(S[i:j])` is a subset of `Sequences(S[i':j'])` if `S[i:j]` is a suffix of `S[i':j']`. This is not generally true.\n\nThe simplest interpretation that matches the example is that we need to count the number of sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[0:k]` for `k=1..N`.\nLet `dp_total[k]` be the total number of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[0:k]`.\n`dp_total[k] = dp_total[k-1] + new_distinct_sequences_from_S[0:k]`.\nThis is still hard.\n\nOkay, let's re-read the problem statement again, very carefully.\n\"Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string S, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\nThe key is \"number of non-empty sequences\". It does not say \"number of *distinct* non-empty sequences\".\nThe example output `1, 3, 7` for `S=\"111\"` could be a coincidence.\nIf it meant sum of `f(S[i:j])`:\n`S=\"1\"`: `f(\"1\")=1`. Total = 1.\n`S=\"11\"`: `f(\"1\")=1`, `f(\"11\")=2`. Substrings: `S[0:1]`, `S[1:2]`, `S[0:2]`.\nSum: `f(S[0:1]) + f(S[1:2]) + f(S[0:2]) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.\nThis is not 3.\n\nThere might be a misunderstanding of `f(S[i:j])`.\n`f(sub)` = number of non-empty sequences.\nExample `S=\"111\"`:\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\")\n\"M\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"O\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TT\" (translates into \"11\")\n\"TM\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"MT\" (translates into \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\nTotal = 7.\nThis is a list of *distinct* sequences. If it were \"sum of ways\", then \"T\" would be counted 3 times, \"M\" 2 times, \"TT\" 2 times, etc.\n\nThe problem is to count *distinct* sequences.\nThe solution must be `O(M^2)` or `O(M log M)` and use `MOD`.\nThis usually implies polynomial hashing.\nWe need to store `(hash1, hash2)` pairs in a global set.\nWhen `S` grows to length `N`:\n  Initialize `dp_hashes[N]` = `{(0,0)}` (hash of empty sequence, length 0).\n  For `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp_hashes[k] = set()`\n    For `length` in `1, 2, 3, 4`:\n      If `k + length <= N`:\n        `code = S[k : k+length]`.\n        If `code` is a valid Morse code:\n          `letter_val = get_letter_value(code)` (1 to 26)\n          For `(h1_suffix, h2_suffix)` in `dp_hashes[k+length]`:\n            `new_h1 = (letter_val * P1 + h1_suffix) % MOD1`\n            `new_h2 = (letter_val * P2 + h2_suffix) % MOD2`\n            `dp_hashes[k].add((new_h1, new_h2))`\n  For `k` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    For `(h1, h2)` in `dp_hashes[k]`:\n      If `(h1, h2)` is not the hash of an empty sequence `(0,0)`:\n        `global_distinct_hashes.add((h1, h2))`\n  Print `len(global_distinct_hashes) % MOD`.\n\nThe issue is that `P1` and `P2` need to be powers of some base, not just prime numbers.\n`hash(L_1 L_2 ... L_p) = (L_1 * B^(p-1) + L_2 * B^(p-2) + ... + L_p * B^0) % MOD`.\nWhen we append `L` to `seq`, `hash(L + seq) = (L * B^len(seq) + hash(seq)) % MOD`.\nSo, `new_h1 = (letter_val * pow(BASE1, len_suffix, MOD1) + h1_suffix) % MOD1`.\nWe need to store `(hash1, hash2, length)` for each sequence.\nThis is the standard approach for counting distinct strings.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences can be `M * (M+1) / 2 * 2^4` if each substring generates distinct sequences.\nThis is `3000^2 * 16` which is too many.\nThere must be a property of Morse codes that limits the number of distinct sequences.\n\nLet's consider the maximum length of a sequence. If `S` is 3000 chars, `S[0:3000]` can be decoded into a sequence of `3000/1 = 3000` letters or `3000/4 = 750` letters.\nA Python `set` of tuples of `(int, int, int)` would be too slow and memory heavy if it stores millions of elements.\n\nThe problem must be simpler than this.\nWhat if `dp[i]` is not a set, but a number?\nIf `dp[i]` is the number of distinct sequences ending at `i`.\nThis is often solvable with Aho-Corasick or suffix structures.\nAho-Corasick is for finding pattern occurrences. Here, patterns are formed dynamically.\n\nLet's check the constraints on `m` again. `1 <= m <= 3000`.\n`M=3000` for `O(M^2)` is borderline. `9 * 10^6` operations could be okay if the constant factor is small.\nIf `dp_sequences[k]` is a `set` of `(hash, length)` for each `k`, the operations inside the loop:\n`dp_sequences[k].add(...)`\n`dp_sequences[k+length]` is a list.

So this interpretation is wrong.\n\nThe `f(S[i:j])` should be the number of non-empty sequences.\nIf `dp_sub[k]` is the number of non-empty sequences for `sub[0:k]`.\n`dp_sub[0] = 0`.\n`dp_sub[k] = (sum_{len=1..4, sub[k-len:k] valid} (1 + dp_sub[k-len])) % MOD`.\nThis `1 + dp_sub[k-len]` means: one way for `sub[k-len:k]` itself, plus ways for `sub[k-len:k]` followed by sequences from `sub[0:k-len]`.\nNo, this is for concatenation. `dp_sub[k]` = number of sequences for `sub[0:k]`.\n`dp_sub[0] = 0`.\n`dp_sub[k] = sum (1 + dp_sub[k-len])`.\nIf `sub=\"1\"`, `k=1`. `dp_sub[0]=0`.\n`len=1`: `sub[0:1]=\"1\"`. Valid. `dp_sub[1] = (dp_sub[1] + 1 + dp_sub[0]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 0) = 1`.\n`f(\"1\") = 1`. Correct.\n\nIf `sub=\"11\"`, `k=2`. `dp_sub[0]=0, dp_sub[1]=1`.\n`dp_sub[2] = 0`.\n`len=1`: `sub[1:2]=\"1\"`. Valid. `dp_sub[2] = (dp_sub[2] + 1 + dp_sub[1]) % MOD = (0 + 1 + 1) = 2`. (\"T\" from `S[1:2]`, \"TT\" from `S[0:1]` then `S[1:2]`).\n`len=2`: `sub[0:2]=\"11\"`. Valid. `dp_sub[2] = (dp_sub[2] + 1 + dp_sub[0]) % MOD = (2 + 1 + 0) = 3`. (\"M\" from `S[0:2]`).\n`f(\"11\") = 3`.\nThis is wrong. `f(\"11\")` should be 2 (\"M\", \"TT\"). My `1 + dp_sub[k-len]` counts \"T\" from `S[1:2]` and \"TT\" from `S[0:1] + S[1:2]`. It also counts \"M\" from `S[0:2]`. Where is the extra 1 coming from?\nIt's `1` for the current letter itself. `dp_sub[k-len]` for sequences starting before.\nThis is `f(S[i:j])`.\n`f(\"11\")`:\n`S[0:1]` -> T. `S[1:2]` -> T. `S[0:2]` -> M.\nSequences: \"T\", \"TT\", \"M\". Count = 3.\nThis `f(\"11\")=3` seems to match my DP. But the example implies `f(\"11\")=2`.\nThis means the example is counting distinct sequences, and my DP is not.\n\nThe only way to reconcile the example with `O(M^2)` and modulo arithmetic is if the total number of distinct sequences is small enough to be counted by some property that transforms into summing up numbers.\nThis is a very common trick for \"counting distinct objects\" when the objects are structured.\nThe \"objects\" are sequences of letters.\nThe length of Morse codes is small (1-4).\nThis means that for any `S[k:N]`, the sequences it can form are determined by `S[k:N]` up to length 4.\nFor example, `S[k:k+4]` could be `L1`. `S[k:k+1]` followed by `S[k+1:k+4]` could be `L2 L3`.\nThe total number of distinct sequences is `|Union_{0<=i<j<=N} Sequences(S[i:j])|`.\nThis is equivalent to: `total_distinct_sequences = 0`.\nFor each `k` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  `total_distinct_sequences = (total_distinct_sequences + (number of distinct sequences from S[k:] that have not been counted before)) % MOD`.\nThis is still a hard problem.\n\nThe problem could be a variation of \"count distinct paths of length K in a graph\".\nThe solution for `M=3000` for counting distinct strings usually involves a generalized suffix tree or suffix automaton. These are too complex for a typical contest.\n\nGiven the constraints and typical competitive programming problem types, it's highly likely that the problem asks for the sum of `f(S[i:j])` where `f(substring)` is the number of ways to decode `substring` into a sequence of letters, and the example is just showing the *types* of sequences, but not the actual count. The example counts distinct sequences, but the problem statement does not explicitly say \"distinct\". In competitive programming, \"number of sequences\" usually means \"sum of ways\" unless \"distinct\" is explicitly stated.\nHowever, the example output values `1, 3, 7` strongly suggest distinctness.\nThis is a common ambiguity in problem statements.\n\nLet's assume the problem means \"sum of ways\" and the example is misleading.\nMy `O(M^2)` solution for sum of ways:\n`MOD = 10^9 + 7`\n`invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}`\n`S = \"\"`\n`total_overall_ans = 0`\n`dp_current_suffix = [0] * (m + 5)` # dp_current_suffix[k] = num ways to decode S[k:] (incl empty)\n\nFor `_` from `0` to `m-1`:\n  `char = input()`\n  `S += char`\n  `N = len(S)`\n\n  `dp_current_suffix[N] = 1` # Empty sequence for empty suffix\n  For `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp_current_suffix[k] = 0`\n    For `length` in `1, 2, 3, 4`:\n      If `k + length <= N`:\n        `sub = S[k : k+length]`\n        If `sub not in invalid_codes`:\n          `dp_current_suffix[k] = (dp_current_suffix[k] + dp_current_suffix[k+length]) % MOD`\n  \n  `current_step_contribution = 0`\n  For `k` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    `current_step_contribution = (current_step_contribution + dp_current_suffix[k] - 1 + MOD) % MOD`\n  \n  `total_overall_ans = (total_overall_ans + current_step_contribution) % MOD`\n  `print(total_overall_ans)`\n\nLet's trace this again for `S=\"111\"` with the first example's output.\n`S=\"1\"`: `N=1`. `dp_current_suffix = [1, 1]`. `current_step_contribution = (dp[0]-1) = 0`. `total_overall_ans = 0`. (Expected 1)\nThis is not matching.\n\nThe example output is `1, 3, 7`.\nLet `ans[N]` be the answer after `N` appends.\n`ans[N] = ans[N-1] + (sum of distinct sequences for substrings ending at index N-1)`.\nLet `dp_distinct[k]` be the set of distinct sequences that can be formed by decoding `S[k:]`.\nThis is where the hashing approach comes in.\n`dp_distinct[N] = { (0,0,0) }` (empty sequence)\nFor `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n  `dp_distinct[k] = set()`\n  For `length` in `1, 2, 3, 4`:\n    If `k + length <= N`:\n      `code = S[k : k+length]`\n      If `code` is valid:\n        `letter_val = get_letter_value(code)`\n        For `(h1_suffix, h2_suffix, len_suffix)` in `dp_distinct[k+length]`:\n          `new_h1 = (letter_val * pow(BASE1, len_suffix, MOD1) + h1_suffix) % MOD1`\n          `new_h2 = (letter_val * pow(BASE2, len_suffix, MOD2) + h2_suffix) % MOD2`\n          `new_len = 1 + len_suffix`\n          `dp_distinct[k].add((new_h1, new_h2, new_len))`\n\n`current_step_distinct_sequences = set()`\nFor `k` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `(h1, h2, len)` in `dp_distinct[k]`:\n    If `len > 0`:\n      `current_step_distinct_sequences.add((h1, h2, len))`\n\n`global_distinct_sequences.update(current_step_distinct_sequences)`\n`print(len(global_distinct_sequences) % MOD)`\n\nThis approach is correct for counting distinct sequences. The only question is if it is fast enough.\nThe number of distinct sequences for `S[k:N]` is `T(N-k)`.\nThe total number of elements in all `dp_distinct[k]` lists could be `sum_{L=1}^{N} T(L)`.\nFor `N=3000`, `T(3000)` is huge.\nThis cannot be the intended solution.\nThe only way this works is if `T(L)` is small for some reason, for example, if many Morse codes are invalid or if many sequences are identical.\nThe invalid codes are only 4 out of 30. This doesn't significantly reduce `T(L)`.\nThe problem states \"each string ... translates into a distinct English letter\". This means `code1 -> L1` and `code2 -> L2` implies `L1 != L2` if `code1 != code2`.\nSo, `T` from \"1\" is distinct from `M` from \"11\".\nThe only way sequences become identical is if `code1 + seq1 == code2 + seq2` where `code1 != code2`.\nE.g., `S=\"0001\"`. `S[0:2]=\"00\"` -> `X`. `S[2:3]=\"0\"` -> `A`. `S[3:4]=\"1\"` -> `T`.\n`S[0:4]` can be `XAT`, `X` + `AT`.\n`S[0:1]=\"0\"` -> `A`. `S[1:2]=\"0\"` -> `A`. `S[2:3]=\"0\"` -> `A`. `S[3:4]=\"1\"` -> `T`.\n`S[0:4]` can be `AAAT`.\n`S[0:2]=\"00\"` -> `X`. `S[2:4]=\"01\"` -> `Y`. `S[0:4]` can be `XY`.\n`S[0:1]=\"0\"` -> `A`. `S[1:3]=\"00\"` -> `X`. `S[3:4]=\"1\"` -> `T`. `S[0:4]` can be `AXT`.\n`S[0:1]=\"0\"` -> `A`. `S[1:4]=\"001\"` -> `Z`. `S[0:4]` can be `AZ`.\nThese are all distinct sequences. So `T(L)` grows fast.\n\nThis problem is a classic \"count distinct paths in a DAG\" type.\nThe standard approach involves polynomial hashing.\nThe global set `all_distinct_sequences` can grow up to `M * (M+1) / 2 * (max possible sequences for a substring)`.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences from a substring of length `L` is `T(L)`.\nThe `dp_distinct[k]` set for `S[k:N]` will contain `T(N-k)` elements.\nThe maximum number of elements in `all_distinct_sequences` is `sum_{k=1}^{M} T(k)`.\nThis sum is `O(T(M))`. So it must be `O(M^2)` for `T(M)` to be `O(M)`.\nBut `T(M)` is exponential.\n\nCould it be that the valid codes are chosen such that `S[k:k+length]` and `S[k':k'+length']` frequently map to the same letter?\n\"each string ... translates into a distinct English letter\". This rules out that.\n\nI am forced to conclude that the example output is `1, 3, 7` because for `S=\"111\"`, the total number of distinct sequences is indeed 7.\nAnd the only way to get this for `M=3000` is if the number of distinct sequences is limited in some way, or the constant factor for the `set.add` operation is very small.\nThe `pow(BASE, len_suffix, MOD)` calculation is problematic if `len_suffix` is large.\nWe need `pow_B1 = [1] * (M+1)` and `pow_B2 = [1] * (M+1)`\n`pow_B1[i] = (pow_B1[i-1] * BASE1) % MOD1`.\nThis precomputation is `O(M)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n    # Predefined invalid Morse codes\n    invalid_codes = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n    # Map Morse codes to integer values (1-26 for A-Z)\n    # This is not strictly necessary for hashing if we just need distinctness,\n    # but it's good practice for string hashing.\n    # We'll use 1-26 for 'A'-'Z' for hashing.\n    # The problem doesn't specify which code maps to which letter,\n    # just that they are distinct letters.
