There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**The \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" Problem: My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this competitive programming problem called \"Zoning Restrictions Again,\" and it seems like a bit of a puzzle at first. The goal is to maximize the total profit from building houses on a street, with profit determined by the square of a house's height. There are restrictions that limit the maximum height of the tallest house within specific ranges on the street.\n\nThe problem's constraints are pretty small (n, h, m <= 50), which tells me that a polynomial-time solution should work. Something like O(n\\*h\\*m) or even O(n^3) should be fine.  \n\nThe core of the problem is figuring out how these restrictions interact. A restriction like \"(l_i, r_i, x_i)\" means that for every spot from l_i to r_i, the house height can't exceed x_i. This is where the crucial insight comes in: for any given spot, its maximum allowed height is determined by the minimum height restriction that covers it.\n\nMy strategy is to pre-compute, for each spot j, the *effective* maximum allowed height. I'll initialize a list `effective_max_height` with all values set to `h` (the global maximum height). Then, I'll go through each restriction and, for each spot within that restriction's range, update its allowed height to be the minimum of its current allowed height and the restriction's height limit (x_i). This `effective_max_height` is the result of applying all the constraints.\n\nOnce I have `effective_max_height`, the profit calculation is straightforward. Since profit is the square of the height, and we want to maximize profit, I just set the height of each house to its maximum allowed value from `effective_max_height`. So, the total profit will be the sum of squares of these heights for each location.\n\nI've checked the logic with the example test cases, tracing the calculations to ensure I arrive at the expected result, including edge-case verification that m >= 1. The code calculates the final total by squaring the values in effective_max_height, and it will correctly handle all possible inputs in the stated range. It seems pretty straightforward: first process the constraints, then, given these restrictions, assign the highest possible value, and calculate the total profit as requested by the problem statement. The algorithm's time complexity is O(m\\*n), which is efficient given the problem constraints. I'm pretty confident that the strategy outlined, and the given code will solve the problem and get me full points.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine the maximum profit from building houses on `n` spots. Each house can have an integer height between `0` and `h`. A house of height `a` yields `a^2` dollars. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house within a given range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nLet's analyze the restrictions. The condition \"the tallest house from spots `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) must be at most `x_i`\" means that for every spot `j` such that `l_i \\le j \\le r_i`, the height of the house at spot `j` (let's denote it `height[j]`) must satisfy `height[j] \\le x_i`.\n\nThis implies that for any individual spot `j`, its height `height[j]` must satisfy two conditions:\n1. `0 \\le height[j] \\le h` (the global maximum height constraint).\n2. For every restriction `k` that covers spot `j` (i.e., `l_k \\le j \\le r_k`), `height[j] \\le x_k`.\n\nCombining these, for each spot `j`, the maximum allowed height `effective_max_height[j]` is the minimum of `h` and all `x_k` values from restrictions that cover spot `j`.\nMathematically: `effective_max_height[j] = min(h, min(x_k for all k such that l_k \\le j \\le r_k))`. If no restrictions cover spot `j`, then `effective_max_height[j] = h`.\n\nOnce we have determined `effective_max_height[j]` for each spot `j`, the problem simplifies. We want to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of `height[j]^2` for all `j`. Since the function `f(a) = a^2` is monotonically increasing for `a \\ge 0`, to maximize `height[j]^2`, we should choose the largest possible integer height for `height[j]`. This largest possible height is exactly `effective_max_height[j]`.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is:\n1. Initialize an array, say `effective_max_height`, of size `n`. Each element `effective_max_height[j]` will store the maximum allowed height for the house at spot `j+1` (using 0-based indexing for the array). Initialize all elements to `h`.\n2. Iterate through each of the `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)`:\n   For each spot `j` from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive):\n     Update `effective_max_height[j-1] = min(effective_max_height[j-1], x_i)`. This ensures that spot `j` adheres to the current restriction.\n3. After processing all restrictions, calculate the total profit:\n   Initialize `total_profit = 0`.\n   For each `height` in `effective_max_height`:\n     `total_profit += height * height`.\n4. Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions: `(1, 1, 1)`, `(2, 2, 3)`, `(3, 3, 2)`\n\n1. Initialize `effective_max_height = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Process restrictions:\n   - `(l=1, r=1, x=1)`: For spot 1, `effective_max_height[0] = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n     `effective_max_height` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - `(l=2, r=2, x=3)`: For spot 2, `effective_max_height[1] = min(3, 3) = 3`. (No change)\n     `effective_max_height` remains `[1, 3, 3]`.\n   - `(l=3, r=3, x=2)`: For spot 3, `effective_max_height[2] = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n     `effective_max_height` becomes `[1, 3, 2]`.\n\n3. Calculate total profit:\n   `total_profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n4. Print `14`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n- **Time Complexity:**\n    - Initializing `effective_max_height`: `O(n)`.\n    - Processing `m` restrictions: Each restriction involves iterating through a range of spots. In the worst case, a range can cover all `n` spots. So, each restriction takes `O(n)` time. Total for `m` restrictions: `O(m * n)`.\n    - Calculating total profit: `O(n)`.\n    - Overall time complexity: `O(n + m*n + n) = O(m*n)`.\n    Given `n, m \\le 50`, `50 * 50 = 2500` operations, which is very efficient.\n- **Space Complexity:**\n    - `effective_max_height` array: `O(n)`.\n    Given `n \\le 50`, this is very small.\n\nThis approach is correct because the restrictions on different spots are only coupled through the range, but ultimately each spot has an independent maximum height determined by the strictest restriction applying to it. Maximizing each `height[j]^2` independently leads to the overall maximum sum.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, h, m from the first line\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Initialize an array to store the maximum allowed height for each spot.\n    # We use 0-based indexing for the array, so spot 'i' (1-indexed) corresponds to effective_max_height[i-1].\n    # Initially, every house can be built up to the global maximum height 'h'.\n    effective_max_height = [h] * n\n\n    # Process each of the m zoning restrictions\n    for _ in range(m):\n        # Read l_i, r_i, x_i for the current restriction\n        l, r, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Convert 1-based indices (l, r) to 0-based indices (l_idx, r_idx)\n        l_idx = l - 1\n        r_idx = r - 1\n\n        # Apply the restriction: for all spots within the range [l_idx, r_idx],\n        # their height must be at most 'x'.
