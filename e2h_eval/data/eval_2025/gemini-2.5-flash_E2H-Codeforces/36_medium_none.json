The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a competitive programming problem. The goal is to figure out the probability of a valid signal power assignment for radio towers in a line of towns. Each town either gets a tower or doesn't with equal probability. I need to make sure towns 0 and n+1 get no signal and that towns 1 to n each get signal from exactly one tower.\n\n**Breaking Down the Conditions:**\n\nFirst, I looked at what makes a valid signal. A tower at town 'i' with power 'p' reaches towns within the range (i-p, i+p). So, town 0 needs to be outside any tower's range, which means the power of any tower 'i' must be less than or equal to 'i'. Similarly, for town n+1 to be safe, the tower's power 'p' must be less than or equal to (n+1-i).  Therefore, the valid power for a tower at town 'i' is between 1 and min(i, n+1-i).\n\nNow, the main constraint: each town from 1 to n must be covered by exactly one tower.\n\n**Exploring the Implications of Coverage:**\n\nThis \"exactly one\" rule got me thinking about how towers overlap.  I realized that if towers overlap, a town could be covered by two towers, breaking the rule. So, the intervals (i-p, i+p) *must* be disjoint, and their union must cover the towns from 1 to n.  This condition seems tricky, as it suggests the coverage zones need to perfectly tile the range.\n\n**Formulating the Problem and Dynamic Programming Considerations:**\n\nI began framing the problem. We want a set 'S' of towns with towers, each assigned a valid power, such that the combined coverage is complete and non-overlapping.  This hints at dynamic programming or combinatorial techniques might be useful. The coverage is broken down:\n1. Power limits: p <= min(i, n+1-i)\n2. Disjoint Coverage\n3. Complete coverage of Towns 1 to n\n\n**Revised Understanding of Coverage**\n\nRethinking the \"disjoint\" condition. It's not *strictly* disjoint intervals in the geometric sense. Towns are at integer coordinates. It means that the *coverage of the towns* must be disjoint. The set of towns covered by a tower 'i' with power 'p' is  { c : |c-i| < p }, an open interval but including all the towns within it.\nMy original intuition regarding the edges of these \"intervals\" was flawed; the coverage can actually be perfectly tight and tile the given range.\n\nThe problem, then, is about finding tower locations and powers such that the individual town coverages don't overlap, and the whole range is covered.\nEssentially, the towns covered form a partition of the space.\n\n**Recalculation with Partitioning in mind.**\n\nNow, the key is the partition of the integer range [1, n].\nDefine effective coverage of a tower at 'i' with power 'p' as range [i-p+1, i+p-1].\nWith a set of towers, we look for coverage sets that are disjoint and form the interval [1, n].\nThis leads to the equations to define tower placement/power:\nIf towers are at positions i_1, i_2,..., i_k:\n-i_1 - power_i1 + 1 = 1  (left-most tower)\n-i_k + power_ik - 1 = n  (right-most tower)\n-each adjacent towers must join (disjoint)\n\n**Parity and Contradiction**\nThe constraints seem to lead to a contradiction! the coverage must tile the integers [1, n] and so all intervals must have the same parity.\n\nThe conditions lead to this: if n is even, it's impossible.\n\n**Conclusion: Re-evaluating the Entire Approach.**\n\nI've made a mistake somewhere in the logic. The problem examples point to valid solutions with even values of 'n'. Something is off with my interpretation of the coverage constraints.\nThe approach seems flawed. I will need to re-examine all of the assumptions to get it correct.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the probability that a valid configuration of signal powers exists, given a random subset of towns $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ where towers are built. Each tower in town $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ is built with probability $1/2$. There are $2^n$ total configurations of towers.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we must choose an integer signal power $p_i \\in [1, n]$.\n\nThe conditions for a valid assignment of powers $p_i$ are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ do not get any signal.\n   A tower at town $i$ with power $p$ reaches cities $c$ such that $|c-i| < p$. This means the interval $(i-p, i+p)$.\n   For town $0$: $0 \\notin (i-p, i+p)$. Since $i \\ge 1, p \\ge 1$, $i+p \\ge 2$, so $0 \\notin (i-p, i+p)$ implies $i-p \\ge 0$, or $p \\le i$.\n   For town $n+1$: $n+1 \\notin (i-p, i+p)$. Since $i \\le n, p \\ge 1$, $i-p < n+1$, so $n+1 \\notin (i-p, i+p)$ implies $i+p \\le n+1$, or $p \\le n+1-i$.\n   Combining these, for each $i \\in S$, we must choose $p_i$ such that $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\n2. Towns $1, 2, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n   Let $C_i = \\{c \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\mid |c-i| < p_i\\}$. This is the set of towns in $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ covered by tower $i$ with power $p_i$.\n   The condition means that the sets $C_i$ for $i \\in S$ must form a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. That is, they must be pairwise disjoint, and their union must be $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n   The towns covered by tower $i$ with power $p_i$ are $i-(p_i-1), \\dots, i+(p_i-1)$. Let's denote this interval of towns as $[i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\n   From condition 1, $p_i \\le i \\implies i-p_i+1 \\ge 1$. And $p_i \\le n+1-i \\implies i+p_i-1 \\le n$. So $C_i$ is always a subinterval of $[1, n]$.\n\nLet $S = \\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the set of towns with towers, sorted such that $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$.\nFor the intervals $[i_j-p_{i_j}+1, i_j+p_{i_j}-1]$ to partition $[1, n]$:\n- The first interval must start at $1$: $i_1-p_{i_1}+1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1} = i_1$.\n- The last interval must end at $n$: $i_k+p_{i_k}-1 = n \\implies p_{i_k} = n+1-i_k$.\n- For adjacent intervals, they must meet exactly: $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$. (This is $R_j = L_{j+1}-1$ in the thought process).\n\nLet's check the constraint $p_j \\le \\min(j, n+1-j)$ for these specific powers:\n- For $i_1$: $p_{i_1}=i_1$. This requires $i_1 \\le \\min(i_1, n+1-i_1)$, which simplifies to $i_1 \\le n+1-i_1$, or $2i_1 \\le n+1$.\n- For $i_k$: $p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$. This requires $n+1-i_k \\le \\min(i_k, n+1-i_k)$, which simplifies to $n+1-i_k \\le i_k$, or $n+1 \\le 2i_k$.\n- For $i_j$ where $1 < j < k$: $p_{i_j}$ is determined by $i_j$ and its neighbors. Specifically, $p_{i_j} = \\frac{(i_j+p_{i_j}-1) - (i_j-p_{i_j}+1) + 2}{2}$.\n  Let $L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$.\n  Then $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ and $p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+2)/2$.\n  For $i_j$ and $p_{i_j}$ to be integers, $L_j+R_j$ must be even and $R_j-L_j$ must be even. This implies $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\n  Since $L_1=1$ (odd), all $L_j$ and $R_j$ must be odd.\n  This means $R_k=n$ must be odd.\n  Therefore, if $n$ is even, no such configuration is possible, and the probability is $0$.\n\nLet's re-check the example $n=2$. $n$ is even. The output is $1/4$. This contradicts my conclusion.\nThe example $n=2$, towers in $1,2$. $p_1=1, p_2=1$.\n$C_1 = [1-1+1, 1+1-1] = [1,1]$.\n$C_2 = [2-1+1, 2+1-1] = [2,2]$.\nThese sets are disjoint and partition $\\{1,2\\}$.\n$p_1=1 \\le \\min(1, 2+1-1) = \\min(1,2) = 1$. OK.\n$p_2=1 \\le \\min(2, 2+1-2) = \\min(2,1) = 1$. OK.\nThis is a valid configuration.\nHere, $L_1=1, R_1=1$. $L_2=2, R_2=2$.\n$L_1=1$ is odd. $R_1=1$ is odd. $L_2=2$ is even. $R_2=2$ is even.\nThe parities are not consistent.\nThe condition $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ and $p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+2)/2$ means that $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nSo $L_1$ and $R_1$ must have the same parity. $L_2$ and $R_2$ must have the same parity.\nBut $R_1$ and $L_2$ do not need to have the same parity.\n$L_1=1, R_1=1$. $p_1=1, i_1=1$. OK.\n$L_2=2, R_2=2$. $p_2=1, i_2=2$. OK.\nThe conditions for $L_j, R_j$ are met.\nThe condition $R_j+1 = L_{j+1}$ is not about parity. It means $R_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ must be consecutive integers, so they must have opposite parities.\nIf $L_j$ and $R_j$ have the same parity, and $L_{j+1}$ and $R_{j+1}$ have the same parity, and $R_j+1 = L_{j+1}$, then $R_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ must have opposite parities.\nThis implies $(L_j, R_j)$ and $(L_{j+1}, R_{j+1})$ must have opposite parities.\nSo $L_1, R_1$ are odd. $L_2, R_2$ are even. $L_3, R_3$ are odd, etc.\nThis means $L_j, R_j$ have parity $(j \\pmod 2 == 1 ? \\text{odd} : \\text{even})$.\nSince $L_1=1$ (odd), $R_k=n$ must have parity $k \\pmod 2 == 1 ? \\text{odd} : \\text{even}$.\nThe number of towers $k$ can be anything.\n\nSo the conditions for a valid configuration of towers $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ are:\n1. $2i_1 \\le n+1$\n2. $n+1 \\le 2i_k$\n3. For $1 \\le j < k$: $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$ (where $p_{i_j}$ are chosen such that $L_j, R_j$ have same parity).\n   This means $p_{i_j} = i_j - (i_j-p_{i_j}+1) + 1$.\n   $p_{i_j} = i_j - L_j + 1$. $p_{i_j} = R_j - i_j + 1$.\n   $L_j = i_j - p_{i_j} + 1$. $R_j = i_j + p_{i_j} - 1$.\n   $L_1=1, R_k=n$.\n   $R_j+1 = L_{j+1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\n   $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\nThis is equivalent to finding a sequence of integers $0=x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_k = n+1$ such that:\nFor each $j=1, \\dots, k$:\n- Tower $i_j = (x_{j-1}+x_j)/2$ must be present in $S$.\n- Power $p_{i_j} = (x_j-x_{j-1})/2$.\n- $x_j-x_{j-1}$ must be even (so $x_{j-1}, x_j$ must have the same parity).\n- $x_j-x_{j-1} \\ge 2$ (so $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$).\n- $p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$ must hold.\n  This means $(x_j-x_{j-1})/2 \\le (x_{j-1}+x_j)/2 \\implies x_j-x_{j-1} \\le x_{j-1}+x_j \\implies 0 \\le 2x_{j-1} \\implies x_{j-1} \\ge 0$. (Always true)\n  And $(x_j-x_{j-1})/2 \\le n+1-(x_{j-1}+x_j)/2 \\implies x_j-x_{j-1} \\le 2(n+1)-(x_{j-1}+x_j) \\implies 2x_j \\le 2(n+1) \\implies x_j \\le n+1$. (Always true)\nSo the only conditions are that $x_j-x_{j-1}$ must be even and $x_j-x_{j-1} \\ge 2$.\nThis means $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$ must have the same parity, and $x_j > x_{j-1}$.\nSince $x_0=0$ (even), all $x_j$ must be even.\nThus, $x_k=n+1$ must be even. This implies $n$ must be odd.\n\nThis is the same conclusion as before, and it still contradicts $n=2$ example.\nThe only possible source of error is the definition of \"city\" and \"towns\".\n\"There are $n+2$ towns located on a coordinate line, numbered from $0$ to $n+1$.\"\n\"The signal from a tower located in a town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches every city $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$.\"\nThe problem uses \"towns\" and \"cities\" interchangeably. Let's assume they refer to the same set of points.\nThe example $n=5$, towers $2,4,5$, powers $2,1,1$.\n$C_2 = \\{1,2,3\\}$, $C_4=\\{4\\}$, $C_5=\\{5\\}$. These are disjoint and form a partition.\n$i_1=2, p_{i_1}=2$. $L_1=1, R_1=3$. $x_0=0, x_1=4$. $i_1=(0+4)/2=2, p_{i_1}=(4-0)/2=2$. This matches.\n$i_2=4, p_{i_2}=1$. $L_2=4, R_2=4$. $x_1=4, x_2=5$. $i_2=(4+5)/2=4.5$. This is not an integer.\nThis implies my derivation $i_j = (x_{j-1}+x_j)/2$ is wrong.\n\nLet's use the $L_j, R_j$ notation for the actual covered intervals of towns.\n$L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$.\nWe need $L_1=1$, $R_k=n$, and $R_j+1=L_{j+1}$ for $j=1, \\dots, k-1$.\nThis means the intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ form a partition of $[1, n]$.\nFor each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, we need $i_j$ and $p_{i_j}$ to be integers, and $1 \\le p_{i_j} \\le \\min(i_j, n+1-i_j)$.\nFrom $L_j, R_j$:\n$i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$. This must be an integer, so $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\n$p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+2)/2$. This must be an integer, so $R_j-L_j$ must be even. This also means $L_j, R_j$ must have the same parity.\nSo, for each $j$, $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nSince $R_j+1=L_{j+1}$, $R_j$ and $L_{j+1}$ must have opposite parities.\nThis means $(L_j, R_j)$ and $(L_{j+1}, R_{j+1})$ must have opposite parities.\nSince $L_1=1$ (odd), $R_1$ must be odd.\nThen $L_2=R_1+1$ must be even, and $R_2$ must be even.\nThen $L_3=R_2+1$ must be odd, and $R_3$ must be odd.\nIn general, $L_j, R_j$ must be odd if $j$ is odd, and even if $j$ is even.\nThis implies $R_k=n$ must have parity $k \\pmod 2 == 1 ? \\text{odd} : \\text{even}$.\n\nThe conditions $p_{i_j} \\le i_j$ and $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$ become:\n$(R_j-L_j+2)/2 \\le (L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+2 \\le L_j+R_j \\implies 2 \\le 2L_j \\implies L_j \\ge 1$. (Always true since $L_1=1$ and $L_{j+1}=R_j+1 > R_j \\ge L_j$).\n$(R_j-L_j+2)/2 \\le n+1-(L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+2 \\le 2n+2-L_j-R_j \\implies 2R_j \\le 2n \\implies R_j \\le n$. (Always true since $R_k=n$ and $R_j < R_k$ for $j<k$).\nSo the only constraints are the parity and $L_j \\ge 1, R_j \\le n$.\n\nA valid configuration requires selecting a set $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$ of towns where towers are built, and a partition $1=L_1 \\le R_1 < L_2 \\le R_2 < \\dots < L_k \\le R_k=n$ of $[1,n]$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ such that:\n1. $L_j$ and $R_j$ have the same parity.\n2. The town $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ must be in $S$.\n3. The power $p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+2)/2$ must be $\\ge 1$. This implies $R_j-L_j+2 \\ge 2 \\implies R_j-L_j \\ge 0 \\implies R_j \\ge L_j$. (Always true).\n\nLet's define $dp[x]$ as the number of ways to partition the interval $[1, x]$ into valid segments $[L_j, R_j]$ with corresponding towers $i_j$.\n$dp[0] = 1$ (empty partition for empty interval).\n$dp[x] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\text{ and } x \\text{ same parity}}^{x} dp[L-1]$ where $L$ and $x$ are the start and end of the last segment $[L, x]$.\nThe tower for segment $[L, x]$ is $i = (L+x)/2$. This tower must be present.\nThe number of ways to choose $L$ is limited by $L \\le x$.\nThe condition is that $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nSo $L_1=1, R_1$ must be odd. $L_2=R_1+1$ must be even, $R_2$ must be even.\n$L_j, R_j$ must have parity according to $j$.\nLet $f[x]$ be the number of ways to partition $[1, x]$ such that $x$ is the end of the $k$-th interval, and $L_k, R_k$ have the required parity.\n$f[x] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\text{ and } x \\text{ have parity } \\text{Parity}(x)}^{x} f[L-1]$ (where $f[0]=1$ and $Parity(x)$ is odd if $x$ is $R_j$ for odd $j$, even if $x$ is $R_j$ for even $j$).\nThis seems complicated because $Parity(x)$ depends on $k$.\n\nLet's simplify. A valid sequence of $L_j, R_j$ is specified by $L_1=1, R_k=n$ and $R_j+1=L_{j+1}$.\nThe sequence of endpoints is $1=L_1 \\le R_1 < R_1+1=L_2 \\le R_2 < R_2+1=L_3 \\le R_3 < \\dots < L_k \\le R_k=n$.\nAll $L_j, R_j$ must have the same parity.\n$L_1=1$ (odd). So $R_1$ must be odd.\n$L_2=R_1+1$ must be even. So $R_2$ must be even.\n$L_3=R_2+1$ must be odd. So $R_3$ must be odd.\nIn general, $R_j$ must be odd if $j$ is odd, and even if $j$ is even.\nSo, $n$ must be odd if $k$ is odd, and $n$ must be even if $k$ is even.\n\nLet $dp[x]$ be the number of ways to partition $[1, x]$ into valid segments.\n$dp[0] = 1$.\n$dp[x] = \\sum_{L=1}^{x} (\\text{if } (L+x)/2 \\text{ is an integer and } (L \\text{ and } x \\text{ have same parity and } R_{prev}+1=L) \\text{ then } dp[L-1])$\nThis is essentially counting sequences of $k$ intervals.\nLet $dp[x]$ be the total number of ways to partition $[1, x]$ into segments $[L_j, R_j]$ such that all conditions are met.\nFor a partition of $[1, x]$, the last segment is $[L, x]$.\nThe tower for this segment is $i = (L+x)/2$.\nThe power for this segment is $p = (x-L+2)/2$.\n$i$ must be an integer, so $L, x$ must have the same parity.\nThe tower at $i$ must be present in $S$.\nThe previous segment ended at $L-1$.\n$dp[x]$ = sum over $L$ such that $1 \\le L \\le x$ and $L, x$ have same parity: $dp[L-1]$.\nThis is the Fibonacci recurrence.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]$: $L=1$. $1,1$ same parity. $dp[0]=1$. So $dp[1]=1$. (Partition $[1,1]$, tower $1$, power $1$).\n$dp[2]$: $L=2$. $2,2$ same parity. $dp[1]=1$. So $dp[2]=1$. (Partition $[1,1][2,2]$ is not allowed. $L=1$: $1,2$ different parity. $L=2$: $2,2$ same parity. $dp[1]=1$. (Partition $[2,2]$, tower $2$, power $1$)).\nThis $dp$ counts ways to partition $[1,x]$ regardless of previous segment's parity.\n$dp[x]$ = ways to cover $[1,x]$ by segments $[L_j, R_j]$ such that $L_j, R_j$ have same parity, and $i_j=(L_j+R_j)/2$ is an integer.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]=dp[0]=1$. $(L=1, R=1)$\n$dp[2]=dp[1]=1$. $(L=2, R=2)$\n$dp[3]=dp[2]+dp[0]=1+1=2$. $(L=1, R=3)$ and $(L=3, R=3)$\n$dp[4]=dp[3]+dp[1]=2+1=3$. $(L=2, R=4)$ and $(L=4, R=4)$\n$dp[x] = dp[x-1]$ if $x$ is odd, using $L=x$.\n$dp[x] = dp[x-1]+dp[x-2]$ if $x$ is odd. Incorrect.\n$dp[x] = \\sum_{L \\le x, L \\equiv x \\pmod 2} dp[L-1]$.\n$dp[x] = dp[x-2] + dp[x-4] + \\dots + dp[x \\pmod 2]$.\n$dp[x-1] = dp[x-3] + dp[x-5] + \\dots + dp[(x-1) \\pmod 2]$.\nIf $x$ is even: $dp[x] = dp[x-2] + dp[x-4] + \\dots + dp[0]$.\nIf $x$ is odd: $dp[x] = dp[x-2] + dp[x-4] + \\dots + dp[1]$.\nSo $dp[x] = dp[x-2] + dp[x-1]$ for $x \\ge 2$.\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence. $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$.\n$dp[0]=1$. $dp[1]=1$. $dp[2]=2$. $dp[3]=3$. $dp[4]=5$. $dp[5]=8$.\nThis is $F_{x+1}$ if $F_0=1, F_1=1$. (or $F_{x+2}$ if $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\nUsing $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$: $dp[x] = F_{x+2}$.\nLet $F_0=1, F_1=1$. Then $dp[x]=F_x$.\n$dp[0]=1$. $dp[1]=1$. $dp[2]=dp[0]+dp[1]=2$. This is $F_2$.\n$dp[x] = F_x$ (where $F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, \\dots$).\nNo, it's $F_{x+1}$ with $F_0=1, F_1=1$.\n$F_0=1, F_1=1, F_2=2, F_3=3, F_4=5, F_5=8$.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[2]=dp[0]+dp[1]=2$.\n$dp[3]=dp[1]+dp[2]=1+2=3$.\n$dp[4]=dp[2]+dp[3]=2+3=5$.\nSo $dp[x]$ is $F_{x+1}$ using $F_0=1, F_1=1$ or $F_{x+2}$ using $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\n\nFor each such partition, we have a set of tower locations $S=\\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$.\nEach $i_j$ is uniquely determined by $L_j, R_j$.\nFor each such $S$, we need to check if the towers in $S$ are exactly the ones built.\nThe probability of a specific set $S$ of $k$ towers being built is $(1/2)^k$.\nThe probability of a specific set $S$ *not* being built is $(1/2)^{n-k}$.\nSo the probability of a specific $S$ being built and others not is $(1/2)^n$.\n\nSo the total probability is $\\sum_{S \\text{ valid}} (1/2)^n$.\nThis means we need to count the number of valid sets $S$.\nA set $S$ is valid if there exists *at least one* way to set powers.\nThe $dp[x]$ counts the number of ways to partition $[1,x]$ into intervals $[L_j, R_j]$ satisfying the parity condition.\nEach such partition uniquely defines a set of tower locations $S = \\{(L_j+R_j)/2 \\mid j=1, \\dots, k\\}$.\nThe problem states \"you will have a way to set signal powers\". This means we just need one such way.\nSo we need to count the number of *distinct sets* $S$ that allow a valid power assignment.\nThe $dp[x]$ counts partitions. Do different partitions give different sets $S$? Yes, because the $i_j$ are defined by $L_j, R_j$. If $L_j, R_j$ are different, $i_j$ is different. If the partitions are different, the set of $(L_j, R_j)$ pairs is different, so the set of $i_j$ values is different.\nSo $dp[n]$ is the number of valid sets $S$.\nThe probability is $dp[n] / 2^n$.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, \\dots$.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[2]=dp[0]+dp[1]=2$.\n$dp[3]=dp[1]+dp[2]=1+2=3$.\n$dp[4]=dp[2]+dp[3]=2+3=5$.\n$dp[x]$ is $F_{x+2}$ for $x \\ge 0$.\nSo the number of valid configurations is $F_{n+2}$.\nThe probability is $F_{n+2} / 2^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's check examples:\n$n=2$: $F_{2+2} = F_4 = 3$. Probability $3/2^2 = 3/4$.\nExample output: $748683265$.\n$3 \\cdot 4^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$. $4^{-1} \\pmod{998244353} = 249561089$.\n$3 \\cdot 249561089 = 748683267$.\nMy result $3/4$. Example $1/4$.\nThere is still a mistake.\n\nWhat if $n=2$, towers $1,2$? $S=\\{1,2\\}$. $i_1=1, i_2=2$.\n$L_1=1, R_1=1$. $p_1=1$. $i_1=1$.\n$L_2=2, R_2=2$. $p_2=1$. $i_2=2$.\nThis is a valid configuration. $dp[2]$ counts this.\nWhat if $n=2$, tower $1$? $S=\\{1\\}$. $i_1=1$. $p_1=1$. $C_1=\\{1\\}$. Town $2$ is not covered. Invalid.\nWhat if $n=2$, tower $2$? $S=\\{2\\}$. $i_1=2$. $p_1=1$. $C_1=\\{2\\}$. Town $1$ is not covered. Invalid.\nWhat if $n=2$, no towers? Invalid.\nSo for $n=2$, only $S=\\{1,2\\}$ is valid. This is 1 way.\nProbability is $1/2^2 = 1/4$.\nMy $dp[2]$ is $2$. Why?\n$dp[2]$ is partitions of $[1,2]$.\n1. $[1,1], [2,2]$. Tower $1$, power $1$. Tower $2$, power $1$. $S=\\{1,2\\}$.\n2. $[1,2]$. Tower $1.5$, power $1.5$. This is not allowed. $i_j$ must be integer.\nSo $L_j, R_j$ must have same parity.\n$dp[x] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv x \\pmod 2}^{x} dp[L-1]$.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]$: $L=1$. $1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. $dp[0]=1$. So $dp[1]=1$. (Partition $[1,1]$). $S=\\{1\\}$.\n$dp[2]$: $L=2$. $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 2$. $dp[1]=1$. So $dp[2]=1$. (Partition $[2,2]$). $S=\\{2\\}$.\nThis is wrong. $L=1, R=1$ is a partition of $[1,1]$. It requires tower $1$. If $n=1$, this is $1/2$.\n$dp[2]$ should be $1$ for $S=\\{1,2\\}$.\nThe partition $[1,1], [2,2]$ is for $n=2$. $L_1=1, R_1=1$. $L_2=2, R_2=2$.\n$i_1=(1+1)/2=1, p_1=(1-1+2)/2=1$.\n$i_2=(2+2)/2=2, p_2=(2-2+2)/2=1$.\nThis means $S=\\{1,2\\}$.\nThe $dp[x]$ counts partitions of $[1,x]$.\n$dp[x]$ = number of ways to partition $[1,x]$ into segments $[L_j, R_j]$ such that $L_j, R_j$ have same parity.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]$: $L=1, R=1$. $dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[2]$: $L=2, R=2$. $dp[1]=1$.\nThe $L=1, R=1$ leads to $i=1$. $L=2, R=2$ leads to $i=2$.\nIf $n=2$, the only valid partition is $1=L_1, R_1=1, L_2=2, R_2=2$. This is one way.\nThe $dp[x]$ recurrence counts partitions of $[1,x]$ where the last segment is $[L,x]$.\n$dp[x]$: The last segment is $[L,x]$. The previous part is $[1,L-1]$.\n$dp[x] = \\sum_{L \\le x, L \\equiv x \\pmod 2} dp[L-1]$.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]$: $L=1$. $1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. $dp[0]=1$. $dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[2]$: $L=2$. $2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 2$. $dp[1]=1$.\n$L=1$. $1 \\not\\equiv 2 \\pmod 2$. So $L=1$ is not allowed for $dp[2]$.\nThis $dp$ is counting partitions where *each segment* $[L_j, R_j]$ has $L_j, R_j$ of the same parity.\nFor $n=2$, the only valid partition is $[1,1], [2,2]$.\n$L_1=1, R_1=1$ (odd, odd). $L_2=2, R_2=2$ (even, even).\nThis is a correct partition.\n$dp[x]$ should count this.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]$: $L=1, x=1$. $L \\equiv x \\pmod 2$. $dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[2]$: We want to partition $[1,2]$.\nThe last segment can be $[2,2]$. Then $L=2, x=2$. $L \\equiv x \\pmod 2$. Previous part is $[1,1]$. $dp[1]=1$.\nSo this gives $1$ partition: $([1,1], [2,2])$.\nThe last segment can be $[1,2]$. Then $L=1, x=2$. $L \\not\\equiv x \\pmod 2$. This is not counted.\nSo $dp[2]=1$. This matches the $n=2$ example.\n\n$dp[3]$:\nLast segment $[3,3]$: $L=3, x=3$. $L \\equiv x \\pmod 2$. Previous part $[1,2]$. $dp[2]=1$. This gives $([1,1],[2,2],[3,3])$. $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$.\nLast segment $[1,3]$: $L=1, x=3$. $L \\equiv x \\pmod 2$. Previous part $[1,0]$. $dp[0]=1$. This gives $([1,3])$. $S=\\{2\\}$.\nSo $dp[3]=1+1=2$.\nFor $n=3$:\n1. $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$. $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=1$.\n   $L_1=1, R_1=1$. $L_2=2, R_2=2$. $L_3=3, R_3=3$.\n   $i_1=1, p_1=1$. $i_2=2, p_2=1$. $i_3=3, p_3=1$.\n   All conditions met.\n2. $S=\\{2\\}$. $p_2=2$.\n   $L_1=1, R_1=3$. $i_1=(1+3)/2=2, p_1=(3-1+2)/2=2$.\n   All conditions met.\nSo for $n=3$, there are $2$ valid configurations.\nProbability $2/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$.\nExample output for $n=3$ is $748683265$. This is $1/4$. My $dp[3]=2$ matches.\n\nSo the recurrence is $dp[x] = \\sum_{L=1, L \\equiv x \\pmod 2}^{x} dp[L-1]$.\n$dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[1]=dp[0]=1$.\n$dp[2]=dp[1]=1$.\n$dp[3]=dp[2]+dp[0]=1+1=2$.\n$dp[4]=dp[3]+dp[1]=2+1=3$.\n$dp[5]=dp[4]+dp[2]=3+1=4$.\n$dp[x] = dp[x-1]$ if $x$ is even. (Only $L=x$ is allowed if $L \\equiv x \\pmod 2$ and $L-1$ is odd. $dp[L-1]$ is $dp[x-1]$).\n$dp[x] = dp[x-1]+dp[x-3]+\\dots+dp[1]$ if $x$ is odd.\n$dp[x-2] = dp[x-3]+\\dots+dp[1]$ if $x-2$ is odd.\nSo $dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-2]$ for $x \\ge 3$ and $x$ is odd.\nIf $x$ is even, $dp[x] = dp[x-1]$ ($L=x$ is the only term).\nThis is not a simple Fibonacci.\n\nLet's write out the sequence:\n$dp[0]=1$\n$dp[1]=1$ ($L=1$)\n$dp[2]=1$ ($L=2$)\n$dp[3]=dp[2]+dp[0]=1+1=2$ ($L=3$ and $L=1$)\n$dp[4]=dp[3]=2$ ($L=4$)\n$dp[5]=dp[4]+dp[2]=2+1=3$ ($L=5$ and $L=3$)\n$dp[6]=dp[5]=3$ ($L=6$)\n$dp[7]=dp[6]+dp[4]=3+2=5$ ($L=7$ and $L=5$)\n$dp[8]=dp[7]=5$ ($L=8$)\n$dp[x]$:\nIf $x$ is even: $dp[x] = dp[x-1]$.\nIf $x$ is odd: $dp[x] = \\sum_{j=0}^{(x-1)/2} dp[x-1-2j]$.\nIf $x$ is odd, $dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-3] + \\dots + dp[0]$.\nSince $x-2$ is odd, $dp[x-2] = dp[x-3] + \\dots + dp[0]$.\nSo for odd $x \\ge 3$, $dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-2]$.\nCombining these:\n$dp[0]=1, dp[1]=1$.\nFor $x \\ge 2$:\nIf $x$ is even: $dp[x] = dp[x-1]$.\nIf $x$ is odd: $dp[x] = dp[x-1] + dp[x-2]$.\n\nThis is a modified Fibonacci sequence.\n$dp[0]=1$\n$dp[1]=1$\n$dp[2]=dp[1]=1$ (even)\n$dp[3]=dp[2]+dp[1]=1+1=2$ (odd)\n$dp[4]=dp[3]=2$ (even)\n$dp[5]=dp[4]+dp[3]=2+2=4$ (odd)\n$dp[6]=dp[5]=4$ (even)\n$dp[7]=dp[6]+dp[5]=4+4=8$ (odd)\n$dp[8]=dp[7]=8$ (even)\n\nThis sequence is $1,1,1,2,2,4,4,8,8, \\dots$.\nFor $n=2$, $dp[2]=1$.

This is correct according to the recurrence.\n\nThe problem states $5/32$ for $n=5$. My $4/32 = 1/8$.\nThis means my count of valid configurations is $4$ but it should be $5$.\nWhat is the 5th configuration for $n=5$?\nLet's list the 4 I found:\n1. $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, powers $1,1,1,1,1$.

This is one of the $dp[5]=4$ solutions.\nThe missing configuration must be one that is not counted by my $dp$ recurrence.\nThe $dp$ recurrence counts partitions $[L_j, R_j]$ where $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity.\nThis implies $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ is an integer.\nIs it possible that $i_j$ is not an integer? No, $i_j$ is a town, so it must be an integer.\nIs it possible that $L_j, R_j$ do not have the same parity?\nIf $L_j, R_j$ do not have the same parity, then $L_j+R_j$ is odd. So $(L_j+R_j)/2$ is not an integer.\nSo $i_j$ is not an integer. This is impossible.\nSo $L_j, R_j$ must have the same parity. This is a fundamental constraint.\nSo my $dp$ recurrence is correct.\nThe Fibonacci sequence for $n=5$ is $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8$.\nThe example output $5/32$ suggests $F_5=5$ solutions.\nMy sequence $1,1,1,2,2,4,4, \\dots$ is not the standard Fibonacci sequence.\nThe number of ways should be $F_{n+1}$ (standard Fib: $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\n$F_{5+1}=F_6=8$.

My $dp[2]=3$.\nThe $n=3$ example is $1/4$. My $dp[3]=5$.\nThe $n=5$ example is $5/32$. My $dp[5]=13$.\n\nThere is something fundamentally wrong with my understanding of what to count.\nThe problem is identical to counting the number of ways to tile a $1 \\times n$ strip with $1 \\times 1$ and $1 \\times 2$ blocks, where $1 \\times 1$ blocks have to be at $i$ and $1 \\times 2$ blocks have to be at $i, i+1$.\nA segment $[L,R]$ has length $R-L+1$.\n$i=(L+R)/2, p=(R-L+2)/2$.\n$p=1 \\implies R-L+2=2 \\implies R=L$. Segment $[L,L]$ (length 1). Tower $L$, power $1$.\n$p=2 \\implies R-L+2=4 \\implies R=L+2$. Segment $[L,L+2]$ (length 3). Tower $L+1$, power $2$.\n$p=3 \\implies R-L+2=6 \\implies R=L+4$. Segment $[L,L+4]$ (length 5). Tower $L+2$, power $3$.\nIn general, segment $[L, R]$ has length $2p-1$.\nSo we are partitioning $[1,n]$ into segments of odd length.\nFor each segment of length $2p-1$, the tower is at $i = (L+R)/2 = L+p-1$.\nThe tower $i$ must be built.\nSince $L, R$ must have same parity, $L+p-1$ is an integer.\nThe number of ways to partition $n$ into odd integers is $F_n$ if $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\nFor $n=1$: $[1]$. $F_1=1$.\nFor $n=2$: No partition into odd integers. $F_2=1$.\nFor $n=3$: $[1][1][1]$ or $[3]$. $F_3=2$.\nFor $n=4$: $[1][1][1][1]$ or $[1][3]$ or $[3][1]$. $F_4=3$.\nFor $n=5$: $[1][1][1][1][1]$ or $[1][1][3]$ or $[1][3][1]$ or $[3][1][1]$ or $[5]$. $F_5=5$.\n\nThis is $F_n$ where $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\n$n=1: F_1=1$. Prob $1/2$.\n$n=2: F_2=1$. Prob $1/4$. Matches.\n$n=3: F_3=2$. Prob $2/8=1/4$. Matches.\n$n=5: F_5=5$. Prob $5/32$. Matches.\n\nThis looks like the correct count!\nThe number of valid configurations is $F_n$ (using $F_0=0, F_1=1$).\nThe total number of possible tower configurations is $2^n$.\nSo the probability is $F_n \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nLet's verify the conditions for $F_n$.\nA partition of $[1,n]$ into segments of odd length $2p_j-1$.\nA segment $[L_j, R_j]$ has length $R_j-L_j+1 = 2p_j-1$.\nThis means $R_j-L_j$ is an even number. So $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity.\nThis implies $i_j=(L_j+R_j)/2$ is an integer.\nAnd $p_j=(R_j-L_j+2)/2$ is an integer.\nThe conditions $p_j \\le i_j$ and $p_j \\le n+1-i_j$ were always true for any valid partition of $[1,n]$ into segments.\n\nSo the problem is simply to count the number of ways to partition $n$ into odd parts.\nThis is indeed $F_n$.\nThe recurrence for $F_n$ is $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.\nWe need to compute $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThen compute $(2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nAnd multiply them.\n\n$F_0=0, F_1=1$.\n$F_2=1$.\n$F_3=2$.\n$F_4=3$.\n$F_5=5$.\n$F_6=8$.\n$F_7=13$.\n$F_8=21$.\n\nThis is the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n$n$ up to $2 \\cdot 10^5$. We can compute $F_n$ in $O(n)$ time using iteration.\nModular inverse of $2^n$ is $(2^{-1})^n$. $2^{-1} \\pmod{998244353} = 499122177$.\nCompute $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nCompute $(499122177)^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nMultiply them.\n\nFinal check on $n=1$:\n$F_1=1$. Prob $1/2$.\nPossible $S=\\{1\\}$. $p_1=1$. $C_1=\\{1\\}$. $0 \\notin (0,2)$, $2 \\notin (0,2)$. Valid.\nPossible $S=\\emptyset$. Invalid.\nTotal $2^1=2$ configurations. Valid $1$. Prob $1/2$. Matches.\n\nThis seems to be the correct logic.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n == 0:\n        # A special case for n=0, though problem states n >= 1.\n        # If n=0, towns are 0 and 1.

The logic seems solid now.The problem asks us to calculate the probability that, after building radio towers in towns $1, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$ each, there exists a way to set signal powers such that:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.\n2. Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $i \\in S$, we choose a signal power $p_i \\in [1, n]$.\nA tower at town $i$ with signal power $p$ reaches cities $c$ such that $|c - i| < p$. This corresponds to the open interval $(i-p, i+p)$.\n\n**Condition 1: Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.**\nFor any tower $i \\in S$ with power $p_i$:\n- $0 \\notin (i-p_i, i+p_i)$: Since $i \\ge 1$ and $p_i \\ge 1$, $i+p_i \\ge 2 > 0$. Thus, this implies $i-p_i \\ge 0$, or $p_i \\le i$.\n- $n+1 \\notin (i-p_i, i+p_i)$: Since $i \\le n$ and $p_i \\ge 1$, $i-p_i < n+1$. Thus, this implies $i+p_i \\le n+1$, or $p_i \\le n+1-i$.\nCombining these, for each tower $i \\in S$, its power $p_i$ must satisfy $1 \\le p_i \\le \\min(i, n+1-i)$.\n\n**Condition 2: Towns $1, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.**\nThe towns covered by a tower at $i$ with power $p_i$ are $c$ such that $i-p_i < c < i+p_i$. Since towns are at integer coordinates, these are the towns $i-(p_i-1), \\dots, i+(p_i-1)$. Let's denote this set of towns as $C_i = [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]$.\nFrom Condition 1, $p_i \\le i \\implies i-p_i+1 \\ge 1$, and $p_i \\le n+1-i \\implies i+p_i-1 \\le n$. So, $C_i$ is always a subinterval of $[1, n]$.\nThe condition states that the sets $C_i$ for $i \\in S$ must form a partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. This means they must be pairwise disjoint, and their union must be exactly $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nLet $S = \\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_k\\}$ be the towns with towers, sorted such that $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k \\le n$.\nFor the intervals $C_j = [i_j-p_{i_j}+1, i_j+p_{i_j}-1]$ to partition $[1, n]$:\n- The first interval $C_1$ must start at $1$: $i_1-p_{i_1}+1 = 1 \\implies p_{i_1}=i_1$.\n- The last interval $C_k$ must end at $n$: $i_k+p_{i_k}-1 = n \\implies p_{i_k}=n+1-i_k$.\n- For any two adjacent intervals $C_j$ and $C_{j+1}$, they must meet exactly: $i_j+p_{i_j}-1 = i_{j+1}-p_{i_{j+1}}$.\n\nLet $L_j = i_j-p_{i_j}+1$ and $R_j = i_j+p_{i_j}-1$.\nThen $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ and $p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+2)/2$.\nFor $i_j$ and $p_{i_j}$ to be integers, $L_j+R_j$ must be even (so $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity) and $R_j-L_j$ must be even (also implying $L_j, R_j$ have the same parity).\nAlso, $p_{i_j} \\ge 1$ implies $(R_j-L_j+2)/2 \\ge 1 \\implies R_j-L_j+2 \\ge 2 \\implies R_j \\ge L_j$. This is always true for a valid interval.\n\nSo, a valid configuration of towers $S$ and powers $p_i$ exists if and only if there is a way to partition the interval $[1, n]$ into segments $[L_j, R_j]$ such that:\n1. Each segment $[L_j, R_j]$ has $L_j$ and $R_j$ with the same parity. (This ensures $i_j$ is an integer).\n2. The tower $i_j = (L_j+R_j)/2$ is present in $S$.\n3. The power $p_{i_j} = (R_j-L_j+2)/2$ satisfies the constraints $p_{i_j} \\le i_j$ and $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j$.\n   - $p_{i_j} \\le i_j \\implies (R_j-L_j+2)/2 \\le (L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+2 \\le L_j+R_j \\implies 2 \\le 2L_j \\implies L_j \\ge 1$. This is true since $L_1=1$ and $L_{j+1} = R_j+1 > L_j$.\n   - $p_{i_j} \\le n+1-i_j \\implies (R_j-L_j+2)/2 \\le n+1-(L_j+R_j)/2 \\implies R_j-L_j+2 \\le 2(n+1)-(L_j+R_j) \\implies 2R_j \\le 2n \\implies R_j \\le n$. This is true since $R_k=n$ and $R_j < R_k$ for $j<k$.\n\nThe only remaining condition is that $L_j$ and $R_j$ must have the same parity. This means the length of each segment $R_j-L_j+1$ must be odd.\nThe problem then reduces to finding the number of ways to partition the integer $n$ into a sum of odd positive integers. Each such partition corresponds to a unique set of towers $S$ and a unique assignment of powers $p_i$.\nFor example, if $n=5$:\n- Partition $5 = 1+1+1+1+1$: segments $[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]$. Towers $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, all $p_i=1$.\n- Partition $5 = 1+1+3$: segments $[1,1],[2,2],[3,5]$. Towers $S=\\{1,2,4\\}$, $p_1=1, p_2=1, p_4=2$.\n- Partition $5 = 1+3+1$: segments $[1,1],[2,4],[5,5]$. Towers $S=\\{1,3,5\\}$, $p_1=1, p_3=2, p_5=1$.\n- Partition $5 = 3+1+1$: segments $[1,3],[4,4],[5,5]$. Towers $S=\\{2,4,5\\}$, $p_2=2, p_4=1, p_5=1$. (This is the example configuration).\n- Partition $5 = 5$: segment $[1,5]$. Tower $S=\\{3\\}$, $p_3=3$.\n\nThe number of ways to partition an integer $n$ into odd positive integers is given by the $n$-th Fibonacci number, $F_n$, where $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nLet's verify this for the examples:\n- For $n=2$: $F_2=1$. This means there is $1$ valid configuration (partition $2=1+1$, towers $S=\\{1,2\\}$ with $p_1=1, p_2=1$). The probability is $1/2^2 = 1/4$. This matches the example output.\n- For $n=3$: $F_3=2$. This means there are $2$ valid configurations (partitions $3=1+1+1$ and $3=3$). The probability is $2/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. This matches the example output.\n- For $n=5$: $F_5=5$. This means there are $5$ valid configurations. The probability is $5/2^5 = 5/32$. This matches the example output.\n\nThus, the problem requires calculating $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$ and then multiplying it by $(2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Compute $F_n \\pmod{998244353}$ using an iterative approach.\n   - Initialize $a=0, b=1$.\n   - For $k$ from $2$ to $n$, update $a, b \\leftarrow b, (a+b) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n   - If $n=0$, $F_0=0$. If $n=1$, $F_1=1$.\n2. Compute $inv\\_2 = 2^{MOD-2} \\pmod{998244353}$ (modular multiplicative inverse of $2$).\n3. Compute $inv\\_2\\_pow\\_n = (inv\\_2)^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\n4. The final answer is $(F_n \\cdot inv\\_2\\_pow\\_n) \\pmod{998244353}$.\n\nThe maximum value of $n$ is $2 \\cdot 10^5$, so an $O(n)$ iterative calculation for $F_n$ is efficient enough. Modular exponentiation takes $O(\\log n)$ time.\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    # Calculate F_n modulo MOD\n    # F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, ...
