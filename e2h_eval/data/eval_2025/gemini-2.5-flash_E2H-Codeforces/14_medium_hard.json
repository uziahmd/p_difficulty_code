He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Finding Numbers with a Specific Number of Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for a competitive programming problem. The goal is to find all positive integers 'n' such that 'n!' (n factorial) ends with exactly 'm' zeroes, given an integer 'm'. I need to output the count of these 'n' values and the 'n's themselves, in ascending order.\n\nThe core concept here is understanding how trailing zeroes work. It's all about the factors of 10 in the factorial. Since 10 is 2 * 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 5. Legendre's formula will help me calculate this efficiently:  `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\n\nI've observed that the `Z(n)` function (the number of trailing zeroes) is non-decreasing. It only increases when 'n' is a multiple of 5.  This is key! If `Z(n) = m`, then the next four numbers, `n+1`, `n+2`, `n+3`, and `n+4`, will also have `m` trailing zeroes, as long as they are not multiples of 5 themselves.  However, at the next multiple of 5 (e.g., `n+5`), the count will go up.\n\nSo, if I find an 'n' where `Z(n) = m`, it's possible the next four numbers will also have that number of zeroes. I need to find the *smallest* 'n' that satisfies `Z(n) = m`. Then, I'll need to count how many consecutive numbers have `m` trailing zeroes. It turns out that there will always be 5 such values, *unless* there is no such 'n'.\n\nTo make this computationally efficient, I'll use binary search.  I'll define a function, `count_trailing_zeroes(n)`, that uses Legendre's formula. Then, I'll do a binary search on the range of possible 'n' values. A good upper bound for this search seems to be `5m` (since `n` is roughly `4m`). I'll search for the smallest 'n' where `count_trailing_zeroes(n) >= m`.\n\nOnce I find that 'n' (let's call it `N_start`), I'll check if `Z(N_start)` is exactly equal to 'm'. If it is, then `N_start`, `N_start+1`, `N_start+2`, `N_start+3`, and `N_start+4` will all have `m` trailing zeroes.  The count will be 5. If `Z(N_start)` is *greater* than 'm', that means there's no integer that satisfies the condition, so I'll output 0.\n\nBased on testing with values like `m = 1` and considering the edge case for `Z(n)` that will never equal m, the binary search and counting logic seems correct.  I'm confident in using `count_trailing_zeroes()` for all values within the expected range, and my logic for determining the count (0 or 5) is robust. The binary search should be quite efficient.\n",
