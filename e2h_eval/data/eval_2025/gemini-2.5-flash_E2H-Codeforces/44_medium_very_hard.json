He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Reflecting on Polycarp's Practice: A Pythonic Solution**\n\nOkay, so the challenge boils down to maximizing the sum of daily profits by strategically dividing problems into segments, right? My initial thought was, \"Let's grab the biggest fish,\" meaning the *k* largest problem difficulties, because we know we want *those* to be the daily \"bosses\". If we can somehow ensure that each of these *k* values is the maximum within its assigned segment, we've nailed the total profit, right?\n\nThe core idea is this: we're aiming for a maximum *sum*. To do that, the *k* largest difficulties *must* be the \"maximum\" for each day. It seems simple to prove. If any element `a[i]` outside our k biggest values is the \"max\" on any particular segment, you could potentially get a *higher* sum by swapping it out with the minimum among *k* max values. So, it's pretty clear that selecting the `k` largest problems is the right move. This gives us the target total profit as the sum of the `k` largest elements.\n\nNow, the tricky part is building the segments around those *k* \"bosses\". The best plan is to take the *k* largest values' *indices* and figure out how to arrange the segments around them. So, I sorted my array `a` along with their indices, kept the top `k` and determined the corresponding indices. The sorted indices of the *k* biggest values are my keys to the segmentation approach. Sorting those helps identify the indices that mark the end of each segment.\n\nThe strategy that makes sense to me is this: after the initial sorting phase:\n\n1.  Make cuts *after* each of the indices of the largest values (sort these indices first) *except* for the last index (it doesn't need to be cut). These cuts become the split points between your days. So, segment 1 will cover problems from the *beginning* up to the index `idx_0`, segment 2 covers from `idx_0+1` through to `idx_1`, and so on.\n\nLet's say `p` are the sorted indices of the largest *k* values, starting from index 0.\n\nSo, for day 1, we include problems from `0` to `p[0]`.\n\nFor day 2, we include problems `p[0]+1` to `p[1]`.\n\nFor day k, the segment becomes `p[k-1]+1` to `n-1`.\n\nThis builds the segments in a sensible way. Now, let's look at the dry-run, and how to verify that each of the `k` largest indices `a[idx_j]` are guaranteed to be segment maximums.\n\nIn a segment from `a[p[j-1]+1]` to `a[p[j]]`, we include a largest element `a[p[j]]`. We are using sorted indices of the `k` largest elements for our cuts. Could there be an index `x < idx_j`, such that `a[x]` is bigger than `a[idx_j]`? No, because if it was, `a[x]` would have to be among the *k* largest values, but `a[x]` could only be among `idx_0, ..., idx_{j-1}`, which means it should come *before*.\n\nThis is a clean solution. The segment lengths `t_j` come out of those splits and become our final output. After a little thinking, I realize a bit of extra effort is needed in Python because we need to handle edge cases in the segmentation logic. Specifically, when handling `k=1`, and when dealing with `k=n`. However, the algorithm should cover all potential cases because we are making the last cut such that the last segment's problems from the index after the last large element to index `n-1`.\n\nFinally, the code itself is pretty straightforward: Read input, pair each problem with its index, sort by difficulty, pick the *k* biggest problems, figure the segment lengths, and print the results. Using `sys.stdin.readline()` and `sys.stdout.write()` should give me a bit of extra speed during input/output for competitive programming scenarios. The complexity is O(N log N) which seems reasonable given the constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to divide `n` problems, given by their difficulties `a_1, ..., a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous sequences (days of practice). For each day, the \"profit\" is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of profits over all `k` days. We need to output the maximum total profit and the number of problems solved each day (`t_1, ..., t_k`).\n\n**Understanding the Maximum Profit**\n\nTo maximize the sum of `k` maximums, we should aim to make these maximums as large as possible. The absolute upper bound for the total profit would be the sum of the `k` largest difficulties present in the entire list `a`. Let these `k` largest difficulties be `v_1, v_2, ..., v_k`. If we can partition the problems such that each `v_i` is the maximum of one of the `k` daily segments, then the total profit will be `sum(v_i)`. This is indeed the maximum possible profit.\n\n**Strategy to Achieve Maximum Profit**\n\n1.  **Identify the `k` largest difficulties:** We find the `k` problems with the highest difficulties. If there are ties in difficulty, any choice among problems with that difficulty is fine.\n2.  **Calculate total profit:** The maximum total profit is simply the sum of these `k` largest difficulties.\n3.  **Determine segment lengths:** To ensure each of these `k` largest difficulties (`v_i`) becomes the maximum of a day's segment, we can use their original indices.\n    *   Let the original indices of these `k` largest problems be `p_1, p_2, ..., p_k`.\n    *   Sort these indices in ascending order: `idx_0 < idx_1 < ... < idx_{k-1}`.\n    *   These `k` indices will serve as \"anchor points\" for our `k` segments. Each `a[idx_j]` will be the maximum of its respective segment.\n    *   We need to make `k-1` cuts to divide `n` problems into `k` segments. We can place these cuts *after* problems `a[idx_0], a[idx_1], ..., a[idx_{k-2}]`. The last segment will then cover problems from `a[idx_{k-1}]` up to `a[n-1]`.\n\n    More precisely, the `k` segments will be:\n    *   Day 1: Problems from index `0` to `idx_0`. Length: `idx_0 + 1`.\n    *   Day 2: Problems from index `idx_0 + 1` to `idx_1`. Length: `idx_1 - idx_0`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `j` (for `1 < j < k`): Problems from index `idx_{j-2} + 1` to `idx_{j-1}`. Length: `idx_{j-1} - idx_{j-2}`.\n    *   Day `k`: Problems from index `idx_{k-2} + 1` to `n-1`. Length: `(n-1) - idx_{k-2}`.\n\n    This strategy ensures that each `a[idx_j]` is the last problem in its segment (for `j < k`) or somewhere in the last segment (for `j = k-1`). Since `a[idx_j]` is one of the `k` largest values overall, and any problem `a[x]` with `x < idx_j` that is also one of the `k` largest would have an index `idx_m` for `m < j`, it would have been assigned to an earlier segment. Thus, `a[idx_j]` is guaranteed to be the maximum of its segment. All segment lengths `t_j` will be positive.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 8, k = 3, a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  **Pairs (difficulty, original_index):**\n    `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2.  **Sort by difficulty (descending):**\n    `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n3.  **Take top `k=3` problems:**\n    `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)]`\n4.  **Total Profit:** `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n5.  **Original indices of these problems:** `[6, 3, 0]`.\n6.  **Sort these indices:** `top_k_indices = [0, 3, 6]`.\n7.  **Calculate day lengths:**\n    *   `current_pos = -1` (conceptual start before index 0)\n    *   For `i = 0` (first `k-1` split points, `k-1 = 2`):\n        *   `split_idx = top_k_indices[0] = 0`\n        *   `length = split_idx - current_pos = 0 - (-1) = 1`.\n        *   `day_lengths = [1]`, `current_pos = 0`.\n    *   For `i = 1`:\n        *   `split_idx = top_k_indices[1] = 3`\n        *   `length = split_idx - current_pos = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n        *   `day_lengths = [1, 3]`, `current_pos = 3`.\n    *   After loop, calculate the last day's length:\n        *   `last_day_length = n - 1 - current_pos = 8 - 1 - 3 = 4`.\n        *   `day_lengths = [1, 3, 4]`.\n\nOutput:\n`20`\n`1 3 4`\n\nThis matches the maximum profit from the example, and `1 3 4` is a valid distribution (different from the example's `3 2 3`, but equally valid as per problem statement).\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Time: O(N log N) dominated by sorting the problems.
