For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Triad Classification**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script that can determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or something \"strange\". I'm thinking about this in terms of semitone distances and note representation, so I'm clear on the logic.\n\nFirst, I need a good way to represent the notes. Mapping each note to an integer from 0 to 11 seems sensible: C as 0, C# as 1, and so on. This will make calculating distances a lot easier. And thinking about the cyclic nature of the notes, the distance calculation needs to wrap around. If I want the distance from a lower note to a higher one, I'll need something like `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12` to handle the wraparound.\n\nNow, for the core of the problem: distinguishing major and minor triads. The definitions give me the semitone distances within each type: major has a 4-3 pattern, while minor has a 3-4 pattern. Since the input is an unordered set, I'll need to account for all permutations of the given notes. However, sorting them first simplifies things by giving me a base, but I'll need to carefully think through how to derive the correct distances. I suspect I'll need to iterate and calculate distances between each pair.\n\nThe task specifies an unambiguous classification. Great! It means I can assume a triad is either major, minor, or \"strange,\" not a combination. This simplifies my logic. I'll need to build a function that receives the triad, calculates the distances between the notes, and compares these distances against the major and minor definitions to classify them accurately.  I'm envisioning the Python code structure now... It'll be a function that takes the notes, maps them to integers, sorts them, then calculates the relevant distances and checks for the 4-3 or 3-4 patterns. Any triad that doesn't fit either pattern will be labeled as \"strange\".\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to classify a given three-note chord (triad) as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\". We are given 12 notes in a cyclic order, and distances are measured in semitones (0.5 tones). A major triad has an ordering of notes X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and from Y to Z is 3 semitones. A minor triad has an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 3 semitones and from Y to Z is 4 semitones.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1.  **Map Notes to Integers:** To easily calculate distances, we first map each of the 12 notes to an integer from 0 to 11.\n    *   C: 0, C#: 1, D: 2, D#: 3, E: 4, F: 5, F#: 6, G: 7, G#: 8, A: 9, B: 10, H: 11.\n\n2.  **Calculate Cyclic Distance:** The distance between two notes `n1` and `n2` (represented as integers) is the number of semitones moving upwards from `n1` to `n2` in the cyclic scale. This can be calculated as `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12`. For example, C (0) to E (4) is `(4 - 0 + 12) % 12 = 4`. E (4) to C (0) is `(0 - 4 + 12) % 12 = 8`.\n\n3.  **Process Input:**\n    *   Read the three space-separated notes.\n    *   Convert each note to its integer representation using the mapping.\n    *   Store these three integers in a list.\n\n4.  **Check All Permutations:** A triad is an *unordered* set of notes. This means any of the three given notes could be X, Y, or Z in the major/minor definition. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the three notes. We need to check each permutation.\n    *   For each permutation `(X, Y, Z)`:\n        *   Calculate `dist1 = (Y - X + 12) % 12` (distance from X to Y).\n        *   Calculate `dist2 = (Z - Y + 12) % 12` (distance from Y to Z).\n        *   If `dist1 == 4` and `dist2 == 3`, it's a major triad.\n        *   If `dist1 == 3` and `dist2 == 4`, it's a minor triad.\n\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   If any permutation satisfies the major condition, print \"major\".\n    *   Else if any permutation satisfies the minor condition, print \"minor\".\n    *   If neither condition is met by any permutation, print \"strange\".\n    *   The problem guarantees the answer is unambiguous.\n\nLet's illustrate with an example: \"C E G\"\n1.  C=0, E=4, G=7.\n2.  Permutations to check for (X, Y, Z):\n    *   (0, 4, 7): dist(0,4)=4, dist(4,7)=3. Matches major! Output \"major\".\n\nExample: \"C# B F\"\n1.  C#=1, B=10, F=5.\n2.  Permutations:\n    *   (1, 10, 5): dist(1,10)=9, dist(10,5)=7. No.\n    *   (1, 5, 10): dist(1,5)=4, dist(5,10)=5. No.\n    *   (10, 1, 5): dist(10,1)=(1-10+12)%12=3, dist(1,5)=4. Matches minor! Output \"minor\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    note_map = {\n        \"C\": 0, \"C#\": 1, \"D\": 2, \"D#\": 3, \"E\": 4, \"F\": 5,\n        \"F#\": 6, \"G\": 7, \"G#\": 8, \"A\": 9, \"B\": 10, \"H\": 11\n    }\n\n    notes_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    notes_int = [note_map[n] for n in notes_str]\n\n    is_major = False\n    is_minor = False\n\n    # Iterate through all permutations of the three notes\n    for p in itertools.permutations(notes_int):\n        x, y, z = p[0], p[1], p[2]\n\n        # Calculate distances (always upwards, modulo 12)\n        dist_xy = (y - x + 12) % 12\n        dist_yz = (z - y + 12) % 12\n\n        # Check for major triad pattern: 4 semitones then 3 semitones\n        if dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3:\n            is_major = True\n            break # Found a major pattern, no need to check further\n\n        # Check for minor triad pattern: 3 semitones then 4 semitones\n        if dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4:\n            is_minor = True\n            break # Found a minor pattern, no need to check further\n    \n    # Output the result based on the findings\n    if is_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif is_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
