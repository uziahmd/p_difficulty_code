Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Array Stabilization: My Solution**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to stabilize an array by removing one element and minimizing the difference between the remaining maximum and minimum values.  Seems straightforward.  The key is realizing that to get the smallest instability, we have to make the largest element as small as possible and the smallest element as big as possible in the remaining array.  \n\nMy first thought was, let's sort the array. It has to be the most efficient approach. Now that it is sorted, removing any element that is *not* the smallest or largest leaves the original extremes, which makes the problem harder. Thus, the minimum instability has to come from removing the smallest or the largest element.\n\nIf we remove the smallest, the new minimum will be the second smallest element. The max will be the old max.  If we remove the largest element, the min remains the same, but the new max becomes the second largest element. So, we calculate the instability for these two cases and then choose the smaller value.  \n\nThe time complexity is dominated by the sort, O(n log n).  Space complexity depends on the sorting used.  This looks like a solid and efficient solution.\n",
