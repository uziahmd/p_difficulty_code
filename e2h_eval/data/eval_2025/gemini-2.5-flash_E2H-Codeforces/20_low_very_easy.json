    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Multiset of Strings Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Multiset of Strings\" problem and it's making my brain do backflips.  I need a Python solution, but first, I need to *really* understand what's going on here. Let's start with the basics, because you always need a solid foundation.\n\nFirst, we're dealing with binary strings, lengths from 1 to *n*. The total number of these strings is 2^(n+1) - 2.  Then, for *each* of these strings, `s`, we get to choose a value `c_s` between 0 and `k`.  This is our knob that we get to turn.\n\nNext, the concept of a \"beautiful multiset\" pops up. This means that a multiset, *M*, composed solely of strings of length *n*, is only beautiful if, for any string `s` of *any* length between 1 and *n*, the number of strings in *M* that start with `s` (have `s` as a prefix) is less than or equal to `c_s`. Got it. So our counts of prefixes from length 1 to length n will influence our decision.\n\nNow, the *goal* is to find how many different ways we can pick those `c_s` values such that the maximum possible size of this beautiful multiset is *exactly* `f`.  We're working modulo 998244353, because, well, the numbers are going to get big.\n\nRight, so the prefix structure. It's a binary tree, a Trie to be exact. A string `s` of length `L` creates two children of length `L+1` which extend off of it. `s0` and `s1`. Any string `t` of length *n* that has `s` as a prefix, must extend off either `s0` or `s1`. So, if `N(s)` is the number of strings that start with `s`, then the constraint is `N(s) <= c_s`.\n\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset... that screams flow network, or maybe min-cut/max-flow to me. Or, more simply, we could probably use a greedy approach on this binary tree. The strings of length *n* are the leaves of the tree. Let's think about this `dp` array now...\n\nI'm thinking of `dp[s]` as the maximum number of length-*n* strings that can *have* `s` as a prefix, given the constraints of the tree. The leaves are easy: if `s` is of length *n*, then `dp[s] = c_s`. And we know that `N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)`. Now, the important part: If `s` has length less than *n*, then `dp[s]` should be the minimum between `c_s` and the sum of `dp[s0]` and `dp[s1]`. So it's `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`. \n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of ways to choose integers `c_s` for all binary strings `s` of length from `1` to `n` (where `0 <= c_s <= k`), such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset of strings of length `n` is exactly `f`. We need to output this count modulo `998244353`.\n\nLet `N(s)` be the number of strings in a multiset `M` (of strings of length `n`) that have `s` as a prefix.\nThe condition for a beautiful multiset is `N(s) <= c_s` for all `s`.\nLet `max_size(c)` be the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given a set of `c_s` values.\nThe total number of strings in the multiset is `N(\"\")`, where `\"\"` denotes the empty string (conceptually, the root of the trie).\nFor any string `s` of length less than `n`, `N(s) = N(s0) + N(s1)`.\nFor a string `s` of length `n`, `N(s)` is simply its count in the multiset.\n\nTo maximize the total size, we can use a dynamic programming approach on the trie structure. Let `dp[s]` be the maximum possible number of strings of length `n` that can have `s` as a prefix, considering only `c_t` values for `t` that are `s` or descendants of `s`.\n- If `s` has length `n`: `dp[s] = c_s`. (This is the maximum count for the string `s` itself).\n- If `s` has length `L < n`: `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\n\nThe maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is `dp[\"\"]` (for the empty string, or `min(c_0, dp[0]) + min(c_1, dp[1])` if we consider `0` and `1` as children of `\"\"`). More precisely, the problem statement implies strings of length 1 to `n` are considered. The total size is `N(0) + N(1)` (where `0` and `1` are strings of length 1). So, the maximum size is `dp[0] + dp[1]`, where `dp[s]` for `s` of length `L` is `min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])` if `L < n`, and `c_s` if `L = n`.\nThe problem asks for `dp[0] + dp[1] = f`.\n\nNotice the symmetry: all strings of the same length `L` behave identically in terms of their recursive contribution to the `dp` value.\nLet `P_L` be the value `dp[s]` for any string `s` of length `L`.\n- `P_n = c_s` (for any `s` of length `n`).\n- `P_L = min(c_s, P_{L+1} + P_{L+1}) = min(c_s, 2 * P_{L+1})` for `L < n`.\n\nThe values `c_s` can be different for different `s` of the same length. However, to achieve a specific `f`, we must choose `c_s` values carefully.\nSince `P_L` depends on `c_s` for `s` of length `L` and `P_{L+1}`, let's denote `P_L` as `val_L`.\n`val_L = min(c_s, 2 * val_{L+1})`.\nThe maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is `val_1 + val_1 = 2 * val_1` (since there are two strings of length 1, `0` and `1`). This is `f`.\nSo, `val_1 = f / 2`. This implies `f` must be even. If `f` is odd, the answer is `0`.\n\nLet `dp[i][j]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s` values for all strings `s` of length `i` through `n` such that `val_i = j`.\nThe base case is for `i = n`.\nFor `val_n = j`, we need to choose `c_s = j` for all `2^n` strings `s` of length `n`.\nNo, this is incorrect. `val_n` is *the value* for a *particular* string `s` of length `n`.\nThe problem is that `c_s` can be different for different `s`.\nLet's consider the number of strings of a certain length `L`. There are `2^L` such strings.\nThe `c_s` values for `s` of length `L` are chosen independently.\nFor a string `s` of length `L`, `val_L(s) = min(c_s, 2 * val_{L+1}(s0), 2 * val_{L+1}(s1))` (if `L < n`).\nThis structure is still problematic because `val_{L+1}(s0)` and `val_{L+1}(s1)` can be different.\n\nThe key observation might be that the problem is asking for the sum of `dp[s]` for `s` of length 1.\n`f = sum_{s of length 1} dp[s]`.\nLet `dp[level][current_val]` be the number of ways to assign `c_t` for `t` being a descendant of some node `s` at `level` such that `dp[s] = current_val`.\nThis still doesn't quite work because `c_s` are chosen.\n\nLet's re-read the example: `n=1, k=42, f=2`.\nStrings are `0` and `1`. We choose `c_0, c_1` from `0` to `42`.\nMax size is `dp[0] + dp[1]`.\nSince `n=1`, `dp[0] = c_0` and `dp[1] = c_1`.\nSo we need `c_0 + c_1 = 2`.\nPossible pairs `(c_0, c_1)`: `(0,2), (1,1), (2,0)`. All `c_s` are `0..42`. These are 3 ways. Example output is 3. This matches.\n\nThis means `dp[s] = c_s` for `s` of length `n`.\nAnd for `s` of length `L < n`, `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\nThe total count is `sum_{s of length 1} dp[s]`.\n\nLet `dp[i][j]` be the number of ways to choose `c_s` for all strings `s` of length `i` to `n` such that for *one specific string* `s_0` of length `i`, `dp[s_0] = j`.\nThis is also not right. The `c_s` values for strings `s` of length `i` are chosen.\nLet's define `ways[i][val]` as the number of ways to choose `c_t` for all strings `t` of length `i` to `n` that are descendants of a *specific* string `s` of length `i-1` such that `dp[s] = val`.\nBase case: `i = n`. `dp[s] = c_s`.\nFor a specific string `s` of length `n-1`, `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\nLet `dp[s0] = x` and `dp[s1] = y`. Then `dp[s] = min(c_s, x+y)`.\nThe number of ways to get `dp[s0]=x` is `ways[n][x]`. The number of ways to get `dp[s1]=y` is `ways[n][y]`.\nFor `dp[s] = j`, we need `min(c_s, x+y) = j`.\nThis means `x+y >= j` and `c_s >= j`.\nAlso, if `x+y = j`, then `c_s` can be any value from `j` to `k`. There are `k-j+1` choices.\nIf `x+y > j`, then `c_s` must be exactly `j`. There is `1` choice.\n\nLet `f_i[j]` be the number of ways to choose the `c_s` values for *one specific path* from a string `s` of length `i` down to strings of length `n`, such that `dp[s] = j`.\nThis `f_i[j]` would be for a single branch.\nFor `i = n`: `dp[s] = c_s`. So `f_n[j]` is 1 if `0 <= j <= k`, and 0 otherwise.\nFor `i < n`: `dp[s] = min(c_s, dp[s0] + dp[s1])`.\n`dp[s0]` and `dp[s1]` are independent.\nThe number of ways to get `dp[s0]=x` is `f_{i+1}[x]`.\nThe number of ways to get `dp[s1]=y` is `f_{i+1}[y]`.\nSo, for a specific `s` of length `i`, the number of ways to get `dp[s] = j` is:\n`f_i[j] = sum_{x=0}^{k} sum_{y=0}^{k} (f_{i+1}[x] * f_{i+1}[y] * ways_c(j, x+y))`\nwhere `ways_c(j, S)` is the number of choices for `c_s` such that `min(c_s, S) = j`.\n- If `S < j`: `min(c_s, S)` can never be `j`. So `ways_c(j, S) = 0`.\n- If `S = j`: `min(c_s, j) = j`. This means `c_s >= j`. So `c_s` can be any value from `j` to `k`. There are `k - j + 1` choices.\n- If `S > j`: `min(c_s, S) = j`. This means `c_s` must be exactly `j`. There is `1` choice.\n\nSo, `f_i[j] = (k - j + 1) * sum_{x+y=j} (f_{i+1}[x] * f_{i+1}[y]) + sum_{x+y>j} (f_{i+1}[x] * f_{i+1}[y])`.\nThe sums are over `x, y` from `0` to `k`.\nThe maximum possible value for `dp[s]` for `s` of length `i` is `k * 2^(n-i)`.\nThe maximum value for `x+y` is `2k * 2^(n-(i+1)) = k * 2^(n-i)`.\nLet `S_k = sum_{x=0}^{k} f_{i+1}[x]`.\nLet `C_i[S] = sum_{x+y=S} (f_{i+1}[x] * f_{i+1}[y])`. This is the convolution `(f_{i+1} * f_{i+1})[S]`.\nLet `PS_i[S] = sum_{val=0}^{S} C_i[val]` be the prefix sum of `C_i`.\nThen `f_i[j] = (k - j + 1) * C_i[j] + (sum_{S=j+1}^{max_sum} C_i[S])`.\nThe second term is `PS_i[max_sum] - PS_i[j]`.\n`PS_i[max_sum]` is `(sum f_{i+1}[x])^2`.\nSo `f_i[j] = (k - j + 1) * C_i[j] + PS_i[max_sum] - PS_i[j]`.\n\nThis `f_i[j]` represents the number of ways for *one specific string* `s` of length `i` to have `dp[s] = j`.\nThere are `2^i` strings of length `i`. All these strings are independent.\nThe final answer is `sum_{j_0 + j_1 + ... + j_{2^1-1} = f} (f_1[j_0] * f_1[j_1] * ... * f_1[j_{2^1-1}])`.\nThis is a sum over `2^1 = 2` terms for `n=1`.\nFor `n=1`, `f_1[j]` is 1 if `0 <= j <= k`, 0 otherwise.\nWe need `j_0 + j_1 = f`.\n`f_1[j_0] * f_1[j_1]` is 1 if `0 <= j_0, j_1 <= k`, 0 otherwise.\nSo we need to count pairs `(j_0, j_1)` such that `j_0 + j_1 = f` and `0 <= j_0, j_1 <= k`.\nNumber of ways = `max(0, min(f, k) - max(0, f-k) + 1)`.\nFor `n=1, k=42, f=2`: `max(0, min(2,42) - max(0, 2-42) + 1) = max(0, 2 - 0 + 1) = 3`. This matches.\n\nThe maximum value `j` can take is `k`.\nFor `i < n`, `j` can take value up to `k * 2^(n-i)`.\nThe final sum is `sum_{j_0 + ... + j_{2^1-1} = f} product_{p=0}^{2^1-1} f_1[j_p]`.\nThis is a multinomial convolution. If `g(x) = sum f_1[j] * x^j`, we need the coefficient of `x^f` in `(g(x))^(2^1)`.\nIn general, we need the coefficient of `x^f` in `(g(x))^(2^{i-1})` where `g(x) = sum f_i[j] * x^j`.\nLet `G_i(x) = sum_{j=0}^{max\\_val} f_i[j] * x^j`.\nWe need to calculate `G_1(x)` and then find the coefficient of `x^f` in `(G_1(x))^2`.\nThis is a standard polynomial exponentiation problem. `(G_1(x))^2` is `G_1(x) * G_1(x)`.\nThe maximum value `j` can take for `f_1[j]` is `k * 2^(n-1)`.\nSo the polynomial `G_1(x)` can have degree up to `k * 2^(n-1)`.\n`n <= 15`, `k <= 2 * 10^5`.\n`2^(n-1)` can be up to `2^14 = 16384`.\n`k * 2^(n-1)` can be `2 * 10^5 * 16384 = 3.2 * 10^9`. This is too large for polynomial multiplication using FFT.\n\nLet's re-evaluate `f_i[j]`.\n`f_i[j]` is the number of ways to choose `c_t` for descendants of `s` (including `s` itself) such that `dp[s] = j`.\nThe `c_s` for string `s` of length `i` is chosen from `0` to `k`.\nThe `f_i[j]` calculation is correct. It is for *one specific string* `s` of length `i`.\nThe total number of strings of length `i` is `2^i`.\nThe total number of ways to pick `c_s` values for `s` of length `i` to `n` such that `sum_{s of length 1} dp[s] = f` is what we need.\n\nLet `dp_val[i]` be the current array for `f_i[j]`.\n`dp_val[n]` is an array where `dp_val[n][j] = 1` for `0 <= j <= k`, and `0` otherwise.\nThe maximum sum for `j` for `dp_val[n]` is `k`.\nFor `i = n-1` down to `1`:\n`max_j_prev = k * 2^(n-(i+1))`.\n`C_i` is the convolution of `dp_val[i+1]` with itself. `C_i[S] = sum_{x+y=S} (dp_val[i+1][x] * dp_val[i+1][y])`.\nThe maximum sum `S` for `C_i` is `2 * max_j_prev`.\n`PS_i` is the prefix sum of `C_i`.\n`max_j_curr = k * 2^(n-i)`.\n`dp_val[i]` is computed using `C_i` and `PS_i` up to `max_j_curr`.\nThe maximum value of `j` can be `k * 2^(n-1)`.\nThis is still very large for the length of arrays `dp_val[i]`. `2 * 10^5 * 2^14` is too big.\n\nThe maximum value of `f` is `2 * 10^5`.\nThis means that `dp[s]` for `s` of length 1 can't be too large.\n`sum_{s of length 1} dp[s] = f`.\nSince there are two strings of length 1 (`0` and `1`), `dp[0] + dp[1] = f`.\nSo `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` cannot exceed `f`.\nThis implies that `f_1[j]` is only relevant for `j <= f`.\nSo the maximum `j` we need to track for `f_1[j]` is `f`.\nThis means the polynomial `G_1(x)` has degree at most `f`.\n`f <= 2 * 10^5`. This is feasible for polynomial multiplication.\n\nLet's refine the `dp_val[i]` approach.\n`dp_val[i]` will be an array of size `f+1`. `dp_val[i][j]` is the number of ways to choose `c_t` for descendants of a string `s` of length `i` such that `dp[s]=j`.\nThe maximum value `j` can take is `k * 2^(n-i)`.\nHowever, if `j > f`, we don't care about the exact value, we just need to know that it's `>f`.\nLet `dp_val[i][j]` be the number of ways to choose `c_t` for descendants of `s` (including `s`) such that `dp[s]=j` for `j < f`.\nAnd `dp_val[i][f]` be the number of ways such that `dp[s] >= f`.\nThis is a standard \"compress states\" technique.\nThe maximum value `k * 2^(n-i)` can be very large.\nFor `i = n`: `dp_val[n][j] = 1` for `0 <= j <= k`.\nIf `k >= f`: `dp_val[n][j] = 1` for `0 <= j < f`, and `dp_val[n][f] = k - f + 1`.\nIf `k < f`: `dp_val[n][j] = 1` for `0 <= j <= k`, and `dp_val[n][f] = 0` (or we can say `dp_val[n][j]=0` for `j > k`).\nSo `dp_val[n]` has length `min(k, f) + 1`. Let's denote `MAX_J = min(k, f)`.\nSo `dp_val[n]` has size `MAX_J+1`.\n`dp_val[n][j] = 1` for `0 <= j <= MAX_J`.\nIf `k > MAX_J`, then `dp_val[n][MAX_J]` should actually be `(k - MAX_J + 1)`. No, this is wrong.\n`dp_val[n][j]` is the count for `dp[s]=j`.\n`dp_val[n][j] = 1` for `0 <= j <= k`.\nIf `j > k`, `dp_val[n][j] = 0`.\nSo `dp_val[n]` is `[1, 1, ..., 1, 0, ...]`. Length `k+1`.\n\nLet `dp_curr = dp_val[i+1]`. `dp_next = dp_val[i]`.\nThe length of `dp_curr` is `min(k * 2^(n-(i+1)), f) + 1`. Let `max_j_curr = min(k * 2^(n-(i+1)), f)`.\nWe need to compute `C_i[S] = sum_{x+y=S} (dp_curr[x] * dp_curr[y])`.\nThis is `dp_curr` convolved with itself. We can use NTT (Number Theoretic Transform) for this.\nThe length of `dp_curr` is at most `f+1`. So `C_i` will have length `2f+1`.\n`MOD = 998244353` is a prime suitable for NTT.\n\nAfter computing `C_i`, we need `PS_i`.\n`PS_i[S] = sum_{val=0}^{S} C_i[val]`.\nThen `dp_next[j]` for `0 <= j <= f`:\n`dp_next[j] = (k - j + 1) * C_i[j] + (PS_i[max_sum_C] - PS_i[j])`.\nHere `max_sum_C` is `min(2 * max_j_curr, f)`.\nThe term `(k-j+1)` can be negative if `j > k`. In that case, `c_s` cannot be `j`, so `ways_c(j, S)` should be 0.\nSo `k-j+1` should be `max(0, k-j+1)`.\nIf `j > k`, then `c_s=j` is impossible, so `min(c_s, S)` cannot be `j`. So `dp_next[j]` must be 0.\nThis implies we only need to compute `dp_next[j]` for `j <= k`.\nAlso, `j` cannot exceed `f`. So `j` goes from `0` to `min(k, f)`.\nLet `MAX_J_FOR_DP_NEXT = min(k, f)`.\n`dp_next[j]` for `0 <= j <= MAX_J_FOR_DP_NEXT`:\n`val_C_j = C_i[j]` (if `j` within `C_i` bounds, else `0`).\n`val_PS_j = PS_i[j]` (if `j` within `PS_i` bounds, else `PS_i[max_sum_C]`).\n`val_PS_max = PS_i[max_sum_C]`.\n`dp_next[j] = (k - j + 1) * val_C_j + (val_PS_max - val_PS_j)`. All modulo `MOD`.\n\nThe length of `dp_val[i]` needs to be `min(k * 2^(n-i), f) + 1`.\nLet `max_val_at_level[i] = min(k * 2^(n-i), f)`.\n`dp_val[n]` has length `max_val_at_level[n]+1`.\n`dp_val[n][j] = 1` for `0 <= j <= k`.\nSo `dp_val[n][j] = 1` for `0 <= j <= max_val_at_level[n]`.\nFor `i` from `n-1` down to `1`:\n  `dp_curr = dp_val[i+1]` (which has length `max_val_at_level[i+1]+1`).\n  `C = NTT(dp_curr, dp_curr)`. Length `2 * max_val_at_level[i+1] + 1`.\n  `PS` = prefix sum of `C`.\n  `dp_next = array of size max_val_at_level[i]+1`.\n  For `j` from `0` to `max_val_at_level[i]`:\n    `val_C_j = C[j]` if `j` is in bounds of `C`, else 0.\n    `val_PS_j = PS[j]` if `j` is in bounds of `PS`, else `PS[len(PS)-1]` (total sum).\n    `val_PS_max = PS[len(PS)-1]`.\n    `term1 = (k - j + 1) * val_C_j`.\n    `term2 = val_PS_max - val_PS_j`.\n    `dp_next[j] = (term1 + term2) % MOD`.\n  `dp_val[i] = dp_next`.\n\nFinal step: The problem asks for `sum_{j_0 + j_1 = f} (f_1[j_0] * f_1[j_1])`.\nThis is `(dp_val[1] * dp_val[1])[f]`.\nSo we compute `C_final = NTT(dp_val[1], dp_val[1])`.\nThe answer is `C_final[f]`.\n\nLet's check `f=0` case. If `f=0`, the only way is `c_s=0` for all `s`.\n`dp_val[n][0]=1`, others 0.\n`dp_val[n-1][0]`: `C[0] = dp_val[n][0]*dp_val[n][0] = 1`. `PS[0]=1`. `PS_max=1`.\n`dp_val[n-1][0] = (k-0+1)*C[0] + (PS_max - PS[0]) = (k+1)*1 + (1-1) = k+1`.\nThis means for `dp[s]=0`, we can choose `c_s` from `0` to `k`.\nThis seems correct. If `dp[s0]=0` and `dp[s1]=0`, then `dp[s]=min(c_s, 0+0)=0`. This is true for any `c_s >= 0`. So `k+1` choices for `c_s`.\nSo `f_i[0] = (k+1)^(n-i)`.\nFor `f=0`, `dp_val[1][0] = (k+1)^(n-1)`.\nThen we need `(dp_val[1] * dp_val[1])[0] = dp_val[1][0] * dp_val[1][0] = ((k+1)^(n-1))^2 = (k+1)^(2(n-1))`.\nThis is the number of ways to pick all `c_s` such that the maximum multiset size is 0.\nExample 1: `n=1, k=42, f=2`.\n`max_val_at_level[1] = min(k * 2^(1-1), f) = min(42*1, 2) = 2`.\n`dp_val[1]` needs to be computed.\nThe loop goes from `i=n-1` down to `1`. Here `n=1`, so loop doesn't run.\n`dp_val[n]` is the base case.\n`dp_val[1][j]` for `j=0,1,2`.\n`dp_val[1][j] = 1` for `0 <= j <= k`.\nSo `dp_val[1] = [1, 1, 1]`.\nFinal step: `C_final = NTT(dp_val[1], dp_val[1])`.\n`C_final[0] = dp_val[1][0]*dp_val[1][0] = 1*1 = 1`.\n`C_final[1] = dp_val[1][0]*dp_val[1][1] + dp_val[1][1]*dp_val[1][0] = 1*1 + 1*1 = 2`.\n`C_final[2] = dp_val[1][0]*dp_val[1][2] + dp_val[1][1]*dp_val[1][1] + dp_val[1][2]*dp_val[1][0] = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`.\nThe answer is `C_final[f] = C_final[2] = 3`. Matches example.\n\nThe maximum length of polynomial for NTT is `2 * f + 1`. `f <= 2 * 10^5`. So length `4 * 10^5`.\nNTT has `O(L log L)` complexity.\nWe do this `n-1` times. Total `O(n * f log f)`.\n`15 * 2 * 10^5 * log(2 * 10^5) approx 15 * 2 * 10^5 * 18 approx 5.4 * 10^7`. This is feasible.\n\nNeed to implement NTT carefully.\nThe maximum `j` for `dp_val[i]` is `min(k * 2^(n-i), f)`.\nLet `current_max_j = f`.\nFor `i = n` down to `1`:\n  `dp_curr` has length `current_max_j + 1`.\n  `C = NTT(dp_curr, dp_curr)`.\n  `PS` = prefix sum of `C`.\n  `next_max_j = min(k * 2^(n-i), f)`.\n  `dp_next = array of size next_max_j + 1`.\n  `PS_max_val = PS[min(len(PS)-1, current_max_j * 2)]`.\n  For `j` from `0` to `next_max_j`:\n    `val_C_j = C[j]` if `j < len(C)`, else `0`.\n    `val_PS_j = PS[j]` if `j < len(PS)`, else `PS_max_val`.\n    `term1 = (k - j + 1) * val_C_j`.\n    `term2 = PS_max_val - val_PS_j`.\n    `dp_next[j] = (term1 + term2) % MOD`.\n    If `j > k`: `dp_next[j] = 0`. (This handles `k-j+1 <= 0` case).\n  `dp_curr = dp_next`. (Renaming for next iteration).\n\nFinal `dp_curr` is `dp_val[1]`.\nFinal answer is `NTT(dp_curr, dp_curr)[f]`.\n\nEdge case `f=0`:\n`dp_val[n][0]=1`.\n`current_max_j = 0`.\n`i=n`: `dp_curr = [1]`.\n`i=n-1`:\n  `C = NTT([1],[1]) = [1]`. `PS = [1]`. `PS_max_val = 1`.\n  `next_max_j = min(k*2^(n-(n-1)), 0) = min(2k, 0) = 0`.\n  `dp_next` of length 1.\n  `j=0`: `val_C_0 = 1`. `val_PS_0 = 1`.\n  `term1 = (k-0+1)*1 = k+1`.\n  `term2 = 1-1 = 0`.\n  `dp_next[0] = k+1`.\n  `dp_curr = [k+1]`.\nThis continues. `dp_curr` becomes `[(k+1)^(n-1)]`.\nFinal step: `NTT([(k+1)^(n-1)], [(k+1)^(n-1)])[0] = ((k+1)^(n-1))^2`. Correct.\n\nIf `f` is very small, say `f=1`.\n`dp_val[n][j]=1` for `j=0,1`. `dp_val[n]=[1,1]`. `current_max_j=1`.\n`i=n-1`:\n  `C = NTT([1,1],[1,1]) = [1,2,1]`. `PS = [1,3,4]`. `PS_max_val=4`.\n  `next_max_j = min(k*2, 1) = 1` (assuming `k >= 1`).\n  `dp_next` of length 2.\n  `j=0`: `val_C_0=1, val_PS_0=1`. `term1=(k+1)*1`. `term2=4-1=3`. `dp_next[0] = k+1+3 = k+4`.\n  `j=1`: `val_C_1=2, val_PS_1=3`. `term1=k*2`. `term2=4-3=1`. `dp_next[1] = 2k+1`.\n  `dp_curr = [k+4, 2k+1]`.\nThis looks reasonable.\n\nNTT implementation details:\n- `MOD = 998244353`\n- Primitive root `G = 3`\n- `invG = pow(G, MOD-2, MOD)`\n- `ntt(a, inverse)` function for forward/inverse transform.\n- `convolve(a, b)` function using `ntt`.\n\nThe `current_max_j` is `min(k * 2^(n-i), f)`.\nFor `i=n`, `current_max_j = min(k, f)`.\nSo `dp_val[n]` is `[1, 1, ..., 1]` up to `min(k,f)`. Length `min(k,f)+1`.\nIf `k < f`, then `dp_val[n]` is `[1, ..., 1]` up to `k`. Length `k+1`.\nIf `k >= f`, then `dp_val[n]` is `[1, ..., 1]` up to `f`. Length `f+1`.\nThis logic is consistent. `max_val_at_level[i]` should be `min(k * (1 << (n-i)), f)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    MOD = 998244353\n    G = 3\n    INV_G = pow(G, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n    # Precompute powers for NTT\n    # Max length of poly is 2*f + 1, so next power of 2 >= 2*f+1\n    # f <= 2e5, so 2f+1 <= 4e5+1.
