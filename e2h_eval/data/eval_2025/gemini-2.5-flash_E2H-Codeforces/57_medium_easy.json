His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Thinking through the Olympiad Ranking Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya in this Olympiad. We've got `n` participants, Vasya got at least `x` points, and we have two sets of scores from the two tours. The core of the problem is figuring out how to pair up scores from the two tours, and then ranking people based on those total scores, where ties go to the jury.\n\n**Best Rank: Getting First Place**\nTo get the best rank, which is rank 1, I want to make sure Vasya gets the highest score possible. That means maximizing his own score while minimizing everyone else's. Since ties are broken by the jury, if Vasya gets the highest score he can secure first place, as there is a guarantee that `a_i + b_j >= x`. The problem is guaranteeing this, so the max score will always be higher than the other people's score.\n\nI figured the best rank is always 1. To do that, he should take the maximum sum that meets or exceeds `x`. No matter what the other scores are, as long as he has the maximum sum, the jury can award him the top spot.\n\n**Worst Rank: Maximizing Other People's Scores Above Vasya**\nNow, the worst rank is trickier. To get the worst rank, I need to figure out how to make Vasya's score as low as possible while still being at least `x`. Then, I want to maximize the number of other participants who score *strictly* higher than him. It involves finding the right pairing of the score lists.\n\nTo get the worst possible rank for Vasya, his score must be as low as possible *but* still greater than or equal to `x`, and at the same time, as many people as possible must score equal to his score but get ranked above him by the jury. So, if we calculate `max_pairs_ge_S(S)`, which is the number of participants that reach the score `S`. We want to maximize this count. It turns out, that maximizing the sum of `max_pairs_ge_S(S)` is at `x` and it is equal to `max_pairs_ge_S(x)`. So this tells the number of people that have a score greater or equal to Vasya, and we can calculate the worst possible rank using that.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad. We are given `n` participants, a minimum score `x` Vasya achieved, `n` scores from the first tour, and `n` scores from the second tour. The key challenge is that we don't know which first tour score belongs to which second tour score, and Vasya is one of these `n` participants. We can pair the scores in any way to form `n` total scores.\n\nThe ranking rules are:\n1.  Participants are sorted by the sum of points for both tours in decreasing order.\n2.  If two or more participants have the same total points, the jury can assign places arbitrarily.\n\nLet's analyze the best and worst case scenarios:\n\n**Best Possible Rank for Vasya:**\nTo achieve the best possible rank (rank 1), Vasya needs to maximize his own score. Since we can pair any `a_i` with any `b_j`, Vasya can choose the highest score from the first tour (`max(a)`) and the highest score from the second tour (`max(b)`). Let `A_max = max(a)` and `B_max = max(b)`. Vasya's score would then be `S_Vasya = A_max + B_max`.\nThe problem guarantees that Vasya got at least `x` points, meaning there exist `a_i, b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. Since `A_max + B_max` is the absolute maximum sum any participant can achieve, it must also be `>= x`.\nIf Vasya achieves `A_max + B_max` points, no other participant can score strictly higher than him. Even if other participants also achieve `A_max + B_max` points (by taking other `a_i` and `b_j` that sum to the same maximum), the jury's decision rule states that Vasya can be assigned the first place among those with tied scores.\nTherefore, Vasya's best possible rank is always **1**.\n\n**Worst Possible Rank for Vasya:**\nTo achieve the worst possible rank, Vasya wants to be placed as low as possible. This means:\n1.  Vasya's total score `S_Vasya` must be at least `x`.\n2.  Among all valid pairings for `n` participants, we want to choose one such that `S_Vasya` is as low as possible, AND the number of participants scoring strictly higher than `S_Vasya` is maximized, AND the number of participants scoring equal to `S_Vasya` (who are not Vasya) is maximized and placed above Vasya.\nIn the worst case, if `k` participants (including Vasya) score `S_Vasya` or more, Vasya could be ranked `k`-th. So, we need to maximize the count of participants who score at least `S_Vasya`.\n\nLet `S_target` be a potential score for Vasya. We need `S_target >= x`.\nWe want to find the maximum number of participants that can achieve a score of at least `S_target` points. Let this count be `C(S_target)`. Vasya's worst rank would then be `C(S_target)`.\nTo maximize `C(S_target)` while ensuring `S_target >= x`, we should choose the smallest possible `S_target`, which is `x`. This is because `C(S_target)` is a monotonically non-increasing function: if `S_1 < S_2`, then `C(S_1) >= C(S_2)`. So, `C(x)` will give us the maximum possible count of participants scoring at least `x`.\n\nNow, how to calculate `C(S_target)` (the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= S_target`)?\nThis can be solved using a greedy two-pointer approach:\n1.  Sort the `a` scores in ascending order.\n2.  Sort the `b` scores in ascending order.\n3.  Initialize `count = 0`, `ptr_a = 0` (for the smallest `a` score), and `ptr_b = n-1` (for the largest `b` score).\n4.  Iterate while `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n    *   If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= S_target`: This pair satisfies the condition. We can form a pair, increment `count`, and move both pointers inward (`ptr_a++`, `ptr_b--`). This greedy choice works because by pairing the smallest available `a` with the largest available `b`, we maximize the chance of meeting `S_target`. If this pair works, we use `a[ptr_a]` and `b[ptr_b]` and move on.\n    *   If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < S_target`: This pair does not satisfy the condition. Since `b[ptr_b]` is the largest available `b`, `a[ptr_a]` cannot be paired with any other `b_k` (where `k < ptr_b`) to reach `S_target` either (because `b_k <= b[ptr_b]`). Thus, `a[ptr_a]` cannot be used to form a pair that sums to at least `S_target`. We must discard `a[ptr_a]` and try the next smallest `a` (`ptr_a++`).\n\nAfter the loop finishes, `count` will hold the maximum number of participants that can score at least `S_target` points. This `count` is Vasya's worst possible rank when `S_target = x`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Read `n` and `x`.\n2. Read the `n` scores for tour 1 into list `a`.\n3. Read the `n` scores for tour 2 into list `b`.\n4. Sort list `a` in ascending order.\n5. Sort list `b` in ascending order.\n6. Initialize `worst_rank = 0`.\n7. Initialize `ptr_a = 0` and `ptr_b = n - 1`.\n8. While `ptr_a < n` and `ptr_b >= 0`:\n    a. If `a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] >= x`:\n        Increment `worst_rank`.\n        Increment `ptr_a`.\n        Decrement `ptr_b`.\n    b. Else (`a[ptr_a] + b[ptr_b] < x`):\n        Increment `ptr_a` (this `a[ptr_a]` is too small to combine with any `b` to reach `x`).\n9. Print `1` (for best rank) and `worst_rank`.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n=5, x=2`\n`a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\nSorted `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\nSorted `b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`worst_rank = 0`, `ptr_a = 0`, `ptr_b = 4`\n\n1. `a[0] + b[4] = 1 + 1 = 2`. `2 >= x (2)` is true.\n   `worst_rank = 1`, `ptr_a = 1`, `ptr_b = 3`.\n2. `a[1] + b[3] = 1 + 1 = 2`. `2 >= x (2)` is true.\n   `worst_rank = 2`, `ptr_a = 2`, `ptr_b = 2`.\n3. `a[2] + b[2] = 1 + 1 = 2`. `2 >= x (2)` is true.\n   `worst_rank = 3`, `ptr_a = 3`, `ptr_b = 1`.\n4. `a[3] + b[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`. `2 >= x (2)` is true.\n   `worst_rank = 4`, `ptr_a = 4`, `ptr_b = 0`.\n5. `a[4] + b[0] = 1 + 1 = 2`. `2 >= x (2)` is true.\n   `worst_rank = 5`, `ptr_a = 5`, `ptr_b = -1`.\nLoop ends. `ptr_a` is `n`.\nOutput: `1 5`.
