Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:** The user needs a Python script to find the longest substring that appears at least twice within a given string, allowing for overlapping occurrences. The string contains only lowercase Latin letters and has a length between 1 and 100.\n\nI'll break the problem down. The main idea is to start with substring lengths from N-1 down to 1. If I find a substring of length L that appears twice, then L is the answer. If no such substring exists, the answer is 0.\n\nTo check a specific length L, I have to generate all substrings of that length and see if any appears at least twice. This can be inefficient.\n\nA more efficient method is the nested loop approach. I'll iterate through all possible starting positions i and j for the two occurrences.  The second starting position (j) must be greater than i to represent a distinct occurrence. I then find the length of the common prefix between substrings starting at i and j. This common prefix is the substring that occurs at least twice. I track the maximum length found during this process.\n\nFor the example string \"ababa,\" with length 5, I traced the execution. It showed how the algorithm finds \"aba\" as the longest repeated substring, with a length of 3. I performed similar traces for \"abcd\" and \"zzz\" to verify the logic works.\n\nThe time complexity of this nested loop approach is O(N^3), which is acceptable for a string length of up to 100. I considered the edge cases like a string of length 1, a string with no repeating characters, and a string with all identical characters. The algorithm correctly handles all of these cases.\n\nThe final code will read the input string, set up the nested loops, calculate the common prefix lengths, and output the final maximum length. I considered the problem statement carefully and ensured the code accounts for the distinct occurrences requirement (j > i). The final code is clean, efficient, and well-tested.",
