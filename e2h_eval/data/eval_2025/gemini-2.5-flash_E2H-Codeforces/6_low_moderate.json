Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Voucher Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down. The goal is to find the cheapest pair of disjoint vouchers that, when combined, have a total duration of *x*.  I need a Python script to solve this efficiently.\n\nBreaking down the problem, I see four key conditions. First, I need *exactly* two vouchers, and they can't be the same one. Second, these vouchers must be *disjoint*, meaning their time intervals don't overlap. Third, their combined duration has to equal *x*. Finally, I want to *minimize* the total cost of these two vouchers.\n\nThe constraints are pretty tight: up to 200,000 vouchers, and duration and cost values can get quite large.  A straightforward brute-force approach, checking every pair, is a non-starter.  That O(N^2) complexity would be a disaster.  I'm aiming for something much faster, ideally O(N log N) or O(N).\n\nMy plan is to fix one voucher, let's call it *i*, and then search for a suitable voucher *j*.  I need to find *j* such that it's disjoint from *i*, its duration combined with *i*'s duration equals *x*, and the sum of their costs is the smallest possible.\n\nThe duration of voucher *i* is simply calculated as `r_i - l_i + 1`. The duration of *j* must be `x - (r_i - l_i + 1)`. If this value is zero or negative, then it's impossible to find a suitable voucher, and I can move on.\n\nNow, about the disjoint condition.  There are two possibilities. Either *j* starts after *i* ends (`r_i < l_j`) or *j* ends before *i* begins (`r_j < l_i`).  These two cases are symmetric, and I need to consider both.\n\nFor a fixed voucher *i*, in the first case (`r_i < l_j`), I need to find a voucher *j* that starts after *i* ends, has the correct duration, and minimizes the cost. Likewise, in the second case, (`r_j < l_i`) I need a voucher *j* that ends before *i* starts, has the right duration and cost.\n\nThese two cases are mirror images of each other.  I'm thinking I can process all the vouchers, and for each voucher *i*, try to locate a corresponding *j* that satisfies the duration and disjoint constraints while minimizing the combined cost.  The key is to organize the search efficiently, to achieve the desired time complexity. I'll need to explore some data structures to make this efficient. I believe I'm on the right track now.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find two distinct, non-overlapping travel vouchers `i` and `j` such that the sum of their durations is exactly `x`, and their total cost `cost_i + cost_j` is minimized.\n\nLet `d_k = r_k - l_k + 1` be the duration of voucher `k`. We are looking for vouchers `i` and `j` such that `d_i + d_j = x`.\nTwo vouchers `i` and `j` are non-overlapping if `r_i < l_j` or `r_j < l_i`.\n\nA brute-force approach of checking all pairs of vouchers would be `O(N^2)`, which is too slow for `N = 2 * 10^5`. We need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet's iterate through each voucher `i` and try to find a suitable voucher `j`. For a fixed `i`, we need `d_j = x - d_i`. If `x - d_i <= 0`, no such `j` can exist. Otherwise, we need to find a voucher `j` with duration `d_j` that doesn't overlap with `i` and has the minimum possible cost.\n\nThe non-overlapping condition `r_i < l_j` or `r_j < l_i` means that voucher `j` must either start after voucher `i` ends, or end before voucher `i` begins.\n\nWe can process the vouchers in a specific order to efficiently find the best `j`. Let's sort all vouchers by their start day `l_k`.\n\nWe can maintain information about the minimum cost for vouchers of specific durations encountered so far.\nLet `min_cost_for_duration[duration]` store the minimum cost of a voucher that has that specific `duration` and has already been processed (i.e., its `r_k` is less than the current `l_i` we are considering).\n\nThe maximum possible `r_k` is `2 * 10^5`. Let's define `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5`.\nWe can use an array `min_cost_ending_at[end_day][duration]` to store the minimum cost of a voucher that ends on `end_day` and has a specific `duration`. This is too much memory.\n\nInstead, let's process vouchers sorted by their start day `l_k`.\nWe can maintain an array `min_cost_for_duration[duration_val]` which stores the minimum cost of a voucher `k` such that `d_k = duration_val` AND `r_k < l_current`.\nThis `min_cost_for_duration` array needs to be updated as we iterate through vouchers.\n\nLet's refine the approach:\n1.  Store all vouchers. It's useful to group them by their start day. Create a list of vouchers for each `l_k`: `vouchers_by_start_day[l_k] = [(r_k, cost_k, d_k), ...]`. The maximum `l_k` is `MAX_COORD`.\n2.  Initialize `min_total_cost = infinity`.\n3.  Initialize an array `min_cost_for_duration` of size `x + 1` (or `MAX_COORD + 1` if `x` can be larger than `MAX_COORD`), filled with infinity. This array will store the minimum cost of a voucher encountered *so far* whose `r_k` is less than the current `l_i` being processed.\n    More precisely, `min_cost_for_duration[d]` will store the minimum cost of a voucher `k` such that `d_k = d` and `r_k < current_l_day`.\n\n4.  Iterate `current_l_day` from 1 to `MAX_COORD`.\n    a.  For each `current_l_day`, we first update `min_cost_for_duration`. Consider all vouchers `(l_prev, r_prev, cost_prev)` that *end* on `current_l_day - 1`. For each such voucher, its duration is `d_prev = r_prev - l_prev + 1`. We can potentially use this voucher as `j` for future vouchers `i` that start at or after `current_l_day`. So, update `min_cost_for_duration[d_prev] = min(min_cost_for_duration[d_prev], cost_prev)`.\n        To do this efficiently, we need to group vouchers by their end day. Let `vouchers_by_end_day[r_k] = [(l_k, cost_k, d_k), ...]`.\n\n    b.  Now, consider all vouchers `(l_i, r_i, cost_i)` that *start* on `current_l_day`. For each such voucher `i`:\n        i.  Calculate its duration `d_i = r_i - l_i + 1`.\n        ii. Calculate the required duration for the second voucher `d_j = x - d_i`.\n        iii. If `d_j > 0` and `d_j <= x` (or `MAX_COORD`):\n            If `min_cost_for_duration[d_j]` is not infinity, it means we have found a valid voucher `j` (whose `r_j < l_i = current_l_day`) with duration `d_j` and cost `min_cost_for_duration[d_j]`.\n            Update `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_i + min_cost_for_duration[d_j])`.\n\nThis approach iterates through `current_l_day` from 1 to `MAX_COORD`. In each step, it processes vouchers that end on `current_l_day - 1` and vouchers that start on `current_l_day`. The total number of voucher processing steps is proportional to `N`.\nThe `min_cost_for_duration` array stores minimum costs for durations up to `x`. Its size is `x+1`.\nThe maximum values for `l_i, r_i, x` are `2 * 10^5`. So `MAX_COORD = 2 * 10^5`.\n\nDetailed algorithm:\n1.  Initialize `min_total_cost = float('inf')`.\n2.  Create two lists of lists: `vouchers_by_start_day = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]` and `vouchers_by_end_day = [[] for _ in range(MAX_COORD + 1)]`.\n3.  Read `n` and `x`. For each voucher `(l, r, cost)`:\n    Calculate `duration = r - l + 1`.\n    `vouchers_by_start_day[l].append((r, cost, duration))`\n    `vouchers_by_end_day[r].append((l, cost, duration))`\n4.  Initialize `min_cost_for_duration = [float('inf')] * (x + 1)`. This array will store the minimum cost of a voucher `k` such that `d_k` is the index, and `r_k < current_l_day`.\n5.  Iterate `current_l_day` from 1 to `MAX_COORD`:\n    a.  **Update `min_cost_for_duration` for vouchers ending on `current_l_day - 1`:**\n        For each voucher `(l_prev, cost_prev, d_prev)` in `vouchers_by_end_day[current_l_day - 1]`:\n            If `d_prev <= x`:\n                `min_cost_for_duration[d_prev] = min(min_cost_for_duration[d_prev], cost_prev)`\n    b.  **Process vouchers starting on `current_l_day`:**\n        For each voucher `(r_i, cost_i, d_i)` in `vouchers_by_start_day[current_l_day]`:\n            Calculate `d_j = x - d_i`.\n            If `d_j > 0` and `d_j <= x`:\n                If `min_cost_for_duration[d_j]` is not `float('inf')`:\n                    `min_total_cost = min(min_total_cost, cost_i + min_cost_for_duration[d_j])`\n\n6.  After the loop, if `min_total_cost` is still `float('inf')`, it means no such pair was found, so print -1.
