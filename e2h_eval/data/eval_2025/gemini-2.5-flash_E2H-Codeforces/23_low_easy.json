            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**My Strategy for the Tokitsukaze Mahjong Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the \"Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\" problem. The core of it is figuring out the *minimum* number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one \"mentsu\" (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) given her initial three tiles. We're looking at a maximum of two draws, because worst case, with three distinct tiles, I can draw two more to complete a triplet.\n\nFirst things first, I need to represent the tiles. Each tile is defined by a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, or s). My initial thought is to parse these as tuples: `(number, suit)`. So, '1m' becomes `(1, 'm')`, '2s' becomes `(2, 's')`, and so on.\n\nThe logic breaks down like this:\n\n**Case 0 Draws:  Can I immediately form a mentsu?**\nThis means I need to check for either a koutsu or a shuntsu with the three given tiles.\n\n*   **Koutsu Check:** Are all three tiles identical? Easy. Just compare the tuples: `t1 == t2 and t2 == t3`.\n*   **Shuntsu Check:** This is a bit more complex. First, the tiles need to be the *same suit*. Second, their numbers have to be sequential. So, I need to check if `suit(t1) == suit(t2) == suit(t3)`. Then, I'll sort the numbers (`n1, n2, n3`) and check if they're sequential: `n_mid == n_min + 1` and `n_max == n_mid + 1`.\n\n**Case 1 Draw: If 0 draws isn't enough, can one more make it?**\nIf the initial three tiles don't form a mentsu, I need to see if drawing *one* more will. Essentially, I now have four tiles. I'll need to check *every possible combination* of three tiles within those four, looking for either a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\nI'm thinking, from a coding perspective, the `(number, suit)` tuple representation makes comparisons and sorting much simpler.  I'll start building the Python script with this approach.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be a koutsu (triplet of identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three sequential tiles in the same suit). She starts with three tiles. The number of draws can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nLet's represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit)`, where `number` is an integer from 1 to 9, and `suit` is a character 'm', 'p', or 's'. This makes comparisons and sorting easier.\n\nWe will check for the minimum number of draws in increasing order: 0, then 1, then 2.\n\n**Helper Function: `has_mentsu(tiles)`**\nThis function will determine if a given set of three tiles forms a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n1.  **Parse and Sort:** Convert tile strings to `(number, suit)` tuples. Sort the tiles. Sorting is crucial for shuntsu checks. A natural sort order is by suit, then by number.\n2.  **Koutsu Check:** If all three tiles are identical, it's a koutsu.\n3.  **Shuntsu Check:** If all three tiles have the same suit AND their numbers are sequential (e.g., `n, n+1, n+2`), it's a shuntsu.\n\n**Main Logic:**\n\n1.  **0 Draws:**\n    Call `has_mentsu()` with the initial three tiles. If it returns true, the answer is 0.\n\n2.  **1 Draw:**\n    If 0 draws is not enough, we need to check if drawing one tile can form a mentsu. With one draw, we will have 4 tiles in hand. We need to check if *any* three of these four tiles form a mentsu.\n    This can be done by iterating through all possible tiles Tokitsukaze could draw (all 27 unique tiles: 1-9 for 'm', 'p', 's'). For each potential drawn tile `d`:\n    *   Form a set of 4 tiles: `[t1, t2, t3, d]`.\n    *   Iterate through all combinations of 3 tiles from this set of 4. There are `C(4,3) = 4` such combinations.\n    *   For each combination of 3 tiles, call `has_mentsu()`. If any of them return true, then 1 draw is sufficient.\n\n3.  **2 Draws:**\n    If neither 0 nor 1 draw is enough, the answer must be 2. This is because we can always form a mentsu with at most 2 draws. For example, if we have a tile `X`, we can draw two more `X` tiles to form a koutsu `[X, X, X]`.\n\n**Detailed `has_mentsu` implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef has_mentsu(tiles):\n    # Parse tiles into (number, suit) tuples\n    parsed_tiles = []\n    for tile_str in tiles:\n        num = int(tile_str[0])\n        suit = tile_str[1]\n        parsed_tiles.append((num, suit))\n\n    # Sort tiles for consistent comparison, especially for shuntsu\n    # Sort by suit first, then by number\n    parsed_tiles.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # Check for Koutsu (triplet)\n    if parsed_tiles[0] == parsed_tiles[1] and parsed_tiles[1] == parsed_tiles[2]:\n        return True\n\n    # Check for Shuntsu (sequence)\n    # 1. All must be of the same suit\n    if parsed_tiles[0][1] == parsed_tiles[1][1] and parsed_tiles[1][1] == parsed_tiles[2][1]:\n        # 2. Numbers must be sequential\n        if parsed_tiles[0][0] + 1 == parsed_tiles[1][0] and parsed_tiles[1][0] + 1 == parsed_tiles[2][0]:\n            return True\n\n    return False\n```\n\n**Main program structure:**\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    input_tiles_str = input().split()\n\n    # --- Check for 0 draws ---\n    if has_mentsu(input_tiles_str):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # --- Check for 1 draw ---\n    # Generate all possible 27 tiles\n    suits = ['m', 'p', 's']\n    all_possible_tiles = []\n    for s in suits:\n        for n in range(1, 10):\n            all_possible_tiles.append(str(n) + s)\n\n    for drawn_tile in all_possible_tiles:\n        current_hand = input_tiles_str + [drawn_tile]\n        # Check all combinations of 3 tiles from the 4 in hand\n        for combo in itertools.combinations(current_hand, 3):\n            if has_mentsu(list(combo)):\n                print(1)\n                return\n\n    # --- If neither 0 nor 1 draw works, 2 draws are needed ---\n    print(2)\n\n# Call the solver function\nsolve()\n\n```",
