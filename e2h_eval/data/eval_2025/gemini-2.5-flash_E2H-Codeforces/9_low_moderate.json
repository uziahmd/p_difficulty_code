Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Optimizing Souvenir Sales: A Knapsack with a Twist**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem, which screams \"knapsack\" but with a few clever wrinkles.  We've got `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `w_i` and a cost `c_i`, and a maximum weight capacity `m`. The goal, as always, is to maximize the total cost of the souvenirs we choose without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nThe core of the problem, and what makes it interesting, is the constraint on the weights: `w_i` can only be 1, 2, or 3. This immediately sets off alarm bells that the standard dynamic programming approach might not be the most efficient route.  The large value of `m` (up to 300,000) rules out the typical `O(n*m)` knapsack solution.\n\nMy instinct is to group the souvenirs by their weights: I'll create lists `items_w1`, `items_w2`, and `items_w3` to store the costs of items with weights 1, 2, and 3, respectively. To make sure I grab the most valuable items first, I need to sort these lists in descending order of cost: `items_w1.sort(reverse=True)`, and so on.\n\nThe main idea is to iterate over the number of items of each weight and then solve the simpler problem of fitting within the total weight.  Let's say `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are the number of items for weight 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The total weight will be `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 + k3 * 3`, which has to be less than or equal to `m`. The total cost then becomes `sum(items_w1[:k1]) + sum(items_w2[:k2]) + sum(items_w3[:k3])`.\n\nNow, trying to iterate over all possible combinations of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` would be computationally expensive. I considered iterating over `k3` and then working out how to fit the remaining weight using items of weight 1 and 2, but even iterating over combinations of `k2` and `k3` would be `O(m^2)`, which isn't efficient enough.\n\nThat's when I realized I can precompute prefix sums! I can create `prefix_cost_w1`, `prefix_cost_w2`, and `prefix_cost_w3`, where `prefix_cost_w1[k]` is the sum of the costs of the `k` most expensive items with weight 1, and so on. This will let me quickly calculate the total cost for any combination of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.\n",
