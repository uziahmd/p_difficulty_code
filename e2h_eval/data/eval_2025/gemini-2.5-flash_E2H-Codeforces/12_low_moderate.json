The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**My Approach to Solving the Xenia and Ringroad Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling the Xenia and Ringroad problem. Let's break this down systematically. The problem gives us `n` houses in a circle, numbered 1 to `n`, and `m` tasks. I'm starting at house 1 and need to complete tasks in the given order. Moving between houses takes a unit of time, and it's clockwise only. My goal is to find the minimum total time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. `n` and `m` can be up to 10^5, so I can't have an inefficient, brute force solution. The task order matters, and the movement is strictly clockwise. The provided example is helpful to visualize.\n\nIn my head, I'm thinking I should maintain `current_pos`, representing my current location, and `total_time`. Initially, `current_pos = 1` and `total_time = 0`. I will iterate through the task houses `a_i`.\n\nFor each task `a_i`, I'll update `target_pos = a_i`. Calculating the time it takes to move from `current_pos` to `target_pos` is the core. There are two cases to consider:\n\n*   **Case 1: `target_pos >= current_pos`**: Straightforward. I move directly clockwise. Time = `target_pos - current_pos`.\n\n*   **Case 2: `target_pos < current_pos`**: I've to wrap around. The time is `(n - current_pos) + (target_pos - 1) + 1` (moving from n to 1). The example highlights this.\n\nAfter each move, I'll update `current_pos` and increment `total_time` appropriately.  I think this will lead to an efficient and accurate solution. Let's translate this thought process into a Python script.\n",
