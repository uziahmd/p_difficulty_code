Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**My Pythonic New Year's Resolution**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"New Year Candles\" problem staring me in the face, and the solution is pretty straightforward, but let's break it down to make sure I'm thinking clearly. It's a competitive programming problem, so I need an efficient Python script. The gist is, I start with `a` candles, each burns for an hour, and then `b` burnt candles can make one new one. The goal is to maximize the total burn time.\n\nThe core of this feels like a simulation. Let's trace it out with a small example, like `a = 4` and `b = 2`. Initially, I have 4 candles, and no burnt ones. I can light all four for four hours. After that, I've got four burnt candles. I can trade those in for two new ones.  Then I light those for two hours, and I've got two burnt ones.  I make one more new candle, lighting that for another hour.  Finally, I have one burnt candle remaining, and no more crafting is possible. So the maximum total is 7 hours.  Yep, that seems logically sound, simulating the process step-by-step.\n\nThe algorithm needs to capture that.  I'll initialize `total_hours` to zero and `current_new_candles` to `a`.  I'll also keep track of `burnt_candles_pile`. The main loop will continue as long as `current_new_candles` is greater than zero. Inside the loop, I'll calculate `hours_this_round` as the current number of new candles.  I'll add this to the `total_hours`.  I'll update the `burnt_candles_pile` with the burnt candles from this round.  Then, I'll calculate how many new candles I can make from crafting (integer division `//` of `burnt_candles_pile` by `b`). The remainder (modulo `%`) becomes the new value of `burnt_candles_pile`. Finally,  `current_new_candles` is updated with the new candles I crafted.\n\nLet's test this thought process by tracing with the example `a = 6` and `b = 3`. Initially, total hours is 0, new candles is 6, and burnt pile is 0.\n1. I light the 6 candles giving me 6 hours and 6 burnt candles.\n2. I craft 6//3 = 2 new candles and my burnt pile is 6 % 3 = 0.\nNow I'm ready to write the python code.\n",
