Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for Disjoint Voucher Pair**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this competitive programming problem, and my gut feeling is that I need a more efficient solution than a simple O(N^2) brute-force.  The core of the problem is finding two vouchers, `i` and `j`, that meet a few crucial criteria: they have to be disjoint, their combined duration must equal `x`, and the total cost needs to be minimized. If no such pair exists, I need to output -1.\n\nLet's break down the conditions.  We're looking for exactly two vouchers, they must be completely non-overlapping (one ends before the other starts), the sum of their individual durations must match `x`, and we want the cheapest possible pair. The constraints give me some boundaries: `n` and `x` are up to 2 * 10^5, and the voucher coordinates and costs are also within reasonable limits.  A naive `O(N^2)` approach is obviously too slow given the constraint on `N`.\n\nMy initial thought is to fix one voucher, let's call it `i`, and then efficiently search for a suitable voucher `j`.  For a fixed `i`, with duration `d_i`, I'm looking for a `j` that satisfies these constraints: it's disjoint from `i`, its duration `d_j` is `x - d_i`, and it has the lowest possible cost.  The disjoint condition is key; it means either `ri < lj` or `rj < li`.  Without loss of generality, I can assume `ri < lj`, so voucher `i` ends before voucher `j` begins.\n\nThe real challenge is how to quickly find such a `j` for each fixed `i`.  I need an efficient way to query for the minimum cost of a voucher that satisfies the disjoint and duration criteria.  My intuition is leaning toward grouping vouchers based on their duration. I think I can create a data structure, let's call it `vouchers_by_duration`, where `vouchers_by_duration[d]` stores a list of vouchers with duration `d`.\n\nMy plan is to iterate through each voucher `i`. For each `i`, I'll calculate its duration `d_i`. Then, I'll calculate the required duration for voucher `j` as `d_j = x - d_i`. The trick will be in querying the `vouchers_by_duration` data structure to quickly find a suitable `j` that satisfies the disjoint condition and minimizes the cost.  I'll need to figure out the most efficient way to do that disjointness check. This approach could be `O(N log N)` or even `O(N)` if I implement the disjointness search correctly.  I'm leaning towards an approach that avoids nested loops as much as possible, as the problem size suggests. I believe this will require careful indexing and potentially a sorted data structure to speed up the search for disjoint vouchers.\n",
