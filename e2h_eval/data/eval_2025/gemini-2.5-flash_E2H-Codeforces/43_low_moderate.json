He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing a String Formation Rule**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this interesting problem. It involves checking if a given string, which I'll call `S`, adheres to a specific set of formation rules. My immediate thought is to break down these rules and see how they constrain the string's structure.\n\nFirst, there's the \"A step\", where the string begins with a certain number of 'a's – let's call that count `count_a`. Then comes the \"B step\", appending 'b's, with `count_b` representing the number of 'b's added. Crucially, there needs to be at least one 'a' and one 'b' (`count_a >= 1` and `count_b >= 1`) after this step. Finally, the \"C step\" introduces 'c's with the count `count_c`. The constraint here is that `count_c` has to equal either `count_a` or `count_b`, or both.\n\nConsidering this, the string `S` must follow a clear pattern: it starts with some 'a's, transitions to 'b's, and ends with 'c's. No other character order is allowed – no 'b' before 'a', no 'c' before 'b', etc. Therefore, I can visualize `S` as being composed of three contiguous sections: `S_a` (all 'a's), `S_b` (all 'b's), and `S_c` (all 'c's).\n\nI can further formalize this by defining the lengths of these sections: `count_a` (length of `S_a`), `count_b` (length of `S_b`), and `count_c` (length of `S_c`). Based on the problem rules, I'm certain that `count_a >= 1` and `count_b >= 1`. However, I'm slightly puzzled about the bounds on `count_c`. The problem description says \"some number\" and \"equal to\", which could suggest `count_c >= 0`. But the rule states there are 'c's *appended*. But, the constraint that `count_c` must equal either `count_a` or `count_b`, and because both `count_a` and `count_b` are >=1, it means that `count_c` must be >= 1. Let me double-check that...\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to determine if a given string `S` can be formed by a specific sequence of operations involving characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Let's break down the rules and derive the necessary conditions:\n\n1.  **A's step**: A starts with some number of 'a's. Let this be `count_a`. So, the string is `a...a`.\n2.  **B's step**: B appends some number of 'b's to the end. Let this be `count_b`. The string becomes `a...ab...b`.\n    *   **Constraint**: At this point, there must be at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. This means `count_a >= 1` and `count_b >= 1`.\n3.  **C's step**: C appends some number of 'c's to the end. Let this be `count_c`. The string becomes `a...ab...bc...c`.\n    *   **Constraint**: `count_c` must be equal to `count_a` OR `count_c` must be equal to `count_b`.\n\nFrom these rules, we can deduce the structure and properties of a valid string `S`:\n\n1.  **Character Order**: The string must consist of all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, followed by all 'c's. There cannot be an 'a' after a 'b', or a 'b' after a 'c', or an 'a' after a 'c'.\n2.  **Counts**:\n    *   `count_a` (number of 'a's) must be `1` or more.\n    *   `count_b` (number of 'b's) must be `1` or more.\n    *   `count_c` (number of 'c's) must be `1` or more, because it must be equal to `count_a` (which is `>=1`) or `count_b` (which is `>=1`).\n    *   The final condition: `count_c == count_a` OR `count_c == count_b`.\n\n**Algorithm to check the string `S`:**\n\n1.  **Find the boundaries of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's:**\n    *   Iterate through the string to find the first character that is not 'a'. The characters before this point are 'a's. Let `count_a` be their number.\n    *   From that point, iterate to find the first character that is not 'b'. The characters between these two points are 'b's. Let `count_b` be their number.\n    *   From that point, iterate to find the first character that is not 'c'. The characters between these two points are 'c's. Let `count_c` be their number.\n    *   After the 'c's, there should be no more characters. If there are any characters left, or if any character in the 'a' section is not 'a', or 'b' section is not 'b', or 'c' section is not 'c', the string is invalid.\n\n2.  **Check the counts and conditions:**\n    *   Ensure `count_a >= 1`.\n    *   Ensure `count_b >= 1`.\n    *   Ensure `count_c >= 1`.\n    *   Ensure `(count_c == count_a)` OR `(count_c == count_b)`.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\n*   **Input: `aaabccc`**\n    *   `count_a = 3` (indices 0, 1, 2 are 'a')\n    *   `count_b = 1` (index 3 is 'b')\n    *   `count_c = 3` (indices 4, 5, 6 are 'c')\n    *   All characters are correctly ordered.\n    *   `count_a = 3 >= 1` (True)\n    *   `count_b = 1 >= 1` (True)\n    *   `count_c = 3 >= 1` (True)\n    *   `count_c == count_a` (3 == 3) is True.\n    *   Result: YES\n\n*   **Input: `bbacc`**\n    *   The string starts with 'b', not 'a'. This violates the character order rule.\n    *   Result: NO\n\n*   **Input: `aabc`**\n    *   `count_a = 2` (indices 0, 1 are 'a')\n    *   `count_b = 1` (index 2 is 'b')\n    *   `count_c = 1` (index 3 is 'c')\n    *   All characters are correctly ordered.\n    *   `count_a = 2 >= 1` (True)\n    *   `count_b = 1 >= 1` (True)\n    *   `count_c = 1 >= 1` (True)\n    *   `count_c == count_a` (1 == 2) is False.\n    *   `count_c == count_b` (1 == 1) is True.\n    *   Since one of the conditions is True, the overall condition is True.\n    *   Result: YES\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\nWe can find `count_a`, `count_b`, `count_c` by iterating through the string and maintaining a pointer `i`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n\n    # Step 1: Count 'a's\n    count_a = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        count_a += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    # Step 2: Count 'b's\n    count_b = 0\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        count_b += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    # Step 3: Count 'c's\n    count_c = 0\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        count_c += 1\n        i += 1\n\n    # Step 4: Check remaining characters (should be none)\n    if i < n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 5: Check all conditions\n    # Condition 1: count_a >= 1\n    # Condition 2: count_b >= 1\n    # Condition 3: count_c >= 1\n    # Condition 4: (count_c == count_a) OR (count_c == count_b)\n    if count_a >= 1 and \\\n       count_b >= 1 and \\\n       count_c >= 1 and \\\n       (count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
