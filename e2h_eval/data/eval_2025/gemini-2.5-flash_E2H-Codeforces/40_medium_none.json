    "thought": "**The Python Challenge: Counting Abnormal Permutation Pairs**\n\nAlright, so I'm tackling this \"Abnormal Permutation Pairs\" problem. Essentially, I need to count pairs of permutations, *p* and *q*, of the numbers 1 to *n*, where *p* comes before *q* lexicographically (*p* < *q*), and crucially, the number of inversions in *p* is greater than the number of inversions in *q* (*inv(p) > inv(q)*). The result needs to be modulo a given number, *mod*, and *n* can be as large as 500.\n\nMy immediate thoughts are, this involves permutation properties: lexicographical order and inversions. The inversion count suggests dynamic programming (DP) might be the way to go. The maximum inversions for *n* is *n*(n-1)/2, which for 500 is roughly 125,000, so a DP approach on inversion counts seems reasonable.\n\nThe total permutations are *n!*, and the total number of permutation pairs is (*n!*)^2. I'm looking for a specific subset. Let's break this down: *p* < *q* means that there's a first position *k* where the two permutations differ, and *p_k* is smaller than *q_k*. I'll try to iterate on *k*. Once *p_k* and *q_k* are chosen, I'll need to figure out what's left for the rest of the permutations.\n\nInversions are defined as the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j but p[i] > p[j]. The number of inversions in a permutation is the sum over all elements, of the number of elements to its right that are smaller. When building the permutation, the number of inversions is the total number of inversions in each step. I think I'll try that. It seems complex.\n\nSo, I'm thinking about breaking down the inversion calculation. If the prefixes of *p* and *q* are identical, then the number of inversions would be a combination of inversions within each prefix, from any elements to its right. It gets messy. I'll need a way to deal with the inversions introduced at each step when I'm building a permutation.\n\nLet's switch to a DP approach. I'll use `dp[i][j]` to represent the number of permutations of *i* elements with *j* inversions. This is a standard DP, `dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][j-k])`, where *k* goes from 0 to *i-1*. The `j-k` can be interpreted to be the inversions with the last value of the permutation. Prefix sums are needed for a faster computation. This part is not specific to the problem, and will be precomputed.\n\nWith my DP table in place, I'll try to address the main condition that p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). The most obvious way would be to fix the first differing index *k* and work outwards from there. The Lex comparison is straight forward. The inversion comparison is where it gets tricky. I can then try to build the rest of *p* and *q*. The DP state may need to keep track of if the current state satisfies *p* < *q*, or if the number of inversions in *p* has surpassed *q*.\n\nThis approach seems computationally expensive. The DP state needs to consider not only lexicographical order but also the running difference in inversion counts. Keeping track of the exact inversion count for each prefix, I realize, might cause a very large state space.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking it. Let me refine the DP and try again. It is not clear yet.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count pairs of permutations $(p, q)$ of $1, \\ldots, n$ such that $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$ and $inv(p) > inv(q)$, modulo $mod$. $n$ can be up to 500.\n\nLet's denote $inv(x)$ as the number of inversions in a permutation $x$.\nThe maximum number of inversions for a permutation of $n$ elements is $M = n(n-1)/2$. For $n=500$, $M \\approx 125000$.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming to count permutations with a given number of inversions.\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of permutations of $i$ distinct elements that have exactly $j$ inversions.\nBase case: $dp[0][0] = 1$.\nFor $i = 1 \\ldots n$:\n  To form a permutation of $i$ elements from a permutation of $i-1$ elements, we insert the $i$-th element (which is the largest of the $i$ elements) into one of $i$ possible positions. If it's inserted at position $k$ (0-indexed from the right, so $k=0$ is the rightmost position, $k=i-1$ is the leftmost position), it creates $k$ new inversions with the $k$ elements that are now to its right and are smaller than it.\n  So, $dp[i][j] = \\sum_{k=0}^{i-1} dp[i-1][j-k]$.\nThis sum can be computed efficiently using prefix sums. Let $S[i-1][x] = \\sum_{y=0}^x dp[i-1][y]$.\nThen $dp[i][j] = (S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][\\max(-1, j-i)]) \\pmod{mod}$. (We define $S[i-1][-1]=0$).\nThe maximum number of inversions for $i$ elements is $i(i-1)/2$.\nThe precomputation of $dp[i][j]$ for all $i \\le n$ and $j \\le M$ takes $O(N \\cdot M)$ time. $500 \\cdot 125000 = 6.25 \\cdot 10^7$, which is feasible.\n\nThe total count for the problem is $\\sum_{p,q: p <_{lex} q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1$.\nLet's define three states for the lexicographical comparison:\n- `EQ`: $p_1 \\ldots p_k = q_1 \\ldots q_k$\n- `LT`: $p_1 \\ldots p_k <_{lex} q_1 \\ldots q_k$\n- `GT`: $p_1 \\ldots p_k >_{lex} q_1 \\ldots q_k$\n\nAnd three states for the inversion comparison:\n- `EQ_INV`: $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_k) = inv(q_1 \\ldots q_k)$\n- `LT_INV`: $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_k) < inv(q_1 \\ldots q_k)$\n- `GT_INV`: $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_k) > inv(q_1 \\ldots q_k)$\n\nLet $dp\\_total[k][\\text{lex\\_state}][\\text{inv\\_state}][\\text{current\\_inv\\_diff}]$ be the number of pairs of prefixes $(p_1 \\ldots p_k, q_1 \\ldots q_k)$ such that they use $k$ distinct numbers, $p_1 \\ldots p_k$ has the specified lexicographical state relative to $q_1 \\ldots q_k$, $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_k)$ has the specified inversion state relative to $inv(q_1 \\ldots q_k)$, and $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_k) - inv(q_1 \\ldots q_k) = \\text{current\\_inv\\_diff}$.\nThis state is too complex because `current_inv_diff` can be large, and the `inv_state` is implicitly encoded by `current_inv_diff`. Also, the actual values matter for inversion counts, not just their ranks.\n\nA common approach for lexicographical problems is to iterate over the first position $k$ where $p_k \\neq q_k$.\nFor $i=1, \\ldots, k-1$, $p_i = q_i$. For $p_k < q_k$.\nWhen $p_i = q_i$ for $i < k$, the relative order of $p_i$ values is the same as $q_i$ values, so $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_{k-1}) = inv(q_1 \\ldots q_{k-1})$.\nLet $P_{k-1} = (p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1})$ and $Q_{k-1} = (q_1, \\ldots, q_{k-1})$.\nLet $S_{rem} = \\{1, \\ldots, n\\} \\setminus \\{p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1}\\}$.\nWhen we choose $p_k \\in S_{rem}$, its contribution to $inv(p)$ from elements $p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1}$ is $\\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} [p_j > p_k]$. Let this be $C(p_k)$.\nSimilarly, $C(q_k) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} [q_j > q_k]$.\nSince $p_j = q_j$, $C(p_k)$ and $C(q_k)$ are well-defined.\n\nLet $dp\\_state[i][j]$ be the number of permutations of $i$ elements where $j$ is the number of inversions relative to $1, \\ldots, i$. This is our $dp[i][j]$ table.\n\nLet $f[i][\\text{inv\\_val}][\\text{lex\\_state}][\\text{inv\\_diff}]$ be the number of ways to pick $i$ elements from $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ for $p_1 \\ldots p_i$ and $q_1 \\ldots q_i$ such that:\n- `inv_val` is $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_i)$\n- `lex_state` is 0 if $p_1 \\ldots p_i = q_1 \\ldots q_i$, 1 if $p_1 \\ldots p_i <_{lex} q_1 \\ldots q_i$, 2 if $p_1 \\ldots p_i >_{lex} q_1 \\ldots q_i$.\n- `inv_diff` is $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_i) - inv(q_1 \\ldots q_i)$.\n\nThis is still not quite right. The values matter for $C(x)$ and for the total inversion count.\nThe key insight from similar problems is to use the property that the number of inversions only depends on the relative order of elements.\nWhen we choose $p_1, \\ldots, p_k$ and $q_1, \\ldots, q_k$, we are choosing $k$ distinct values from $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ for $p$ and $k$ distinct values for $q$.\nThe values chosen for $p_1, \\ldots, p_k$ are not necessarily the same as for $q_1, \\ldots, q_k$ unless $p_j=q_j$.\n\nLet $dp[k][inv\\_p][inv\\_q][\\text{lex\\_equal}]$ be the number of pairs of $k$-length prefixes $(p_1 \\ldots p_k, q_1 \\ldots q_k)$ using $k$ distinct values for $p$ and $k$ distinct values for $q$ (not necessarily the same sets of values) such that:\n- $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_k) = inv\\_p$\n- $inv(q_1 \\ldots q_k) = inv\\_q$\n- `lex_equal` is true if $p_1 \\ldots p_k = q_1 \\ldots q_k$, false otherwise.\n\nThis DP state is also problematic because the values themselves contribute to inversions. For example, $inv([1,3]) = 0$ but $inv([2,3]) = 0$. However, if we later append $1$, $inv([1,3,1])$ is not well-defined. If we append $1$ to $[1,3]$ to get $[1,3,2]$ (using values $1,2,3$), it's different from appending $1$ to $[2,3]$ to get $[2,3,1]$.\n\nThe standard approach for $N \\le 500$ for this type of problem is $O(N^3)$ or $O(N^4)$ with small constant factors.\nLet's consider the total number of inversions for the entire permutation.\n$inv(p) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\text{number of } j<i \\text{ such that } p_j > p_i)$.\n\nLet $dp[i][j][k]$ be the number of ways to pick $i$ values for $p_1 \\ldots p_i$ and $i$ values for $q_1 \\ldots q_i$ from $n$ available values, such that $p_1 \\ldots p_i$ has $j$ inversions and $q_1 \\ldots q_i$ has $k$ inversions.\nThis is not what we want. We need to count pairs of permutations $(p,q)$ of $1 \\ldots n$.\n\nLet $dp[i][j][\\text{inv\\_sum}]$ be the number of pairs of prefixes $(p_1 \\ldots p_i, q_1 \\ldots q_i)$ where $p_1 \\ldots p_i$ and $q_1 \\ldots q_i$ are permutations of $i$ distinct elements, $p_1 \\ldots p_i$ has $j$ inversions, and $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_i) + inv(q_1 \\ldots q_i) = \\text{inv\\_sum}$. This is also not directly helpful.\n\nLet's define $dp[i][j]$ as the number of permutations of length $i$ with $j$ inversions, where the elements are $\\{1, \\ldots, i\\}$. This is what we computed.\nLet $pref[i][j]$ be the prefix sums of $dp[i][\\cdot]$.\n\nConsider a DP state $f[i][j][s]$:\n$i$: current length of prefixes $p_1 \\ldots p_i$ and $q_1 \\ldots q_i$.\n$j$: current difference $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_i) - inv(q_1 \\ldots q_i)$.\n$s$: state for lexicographical comparison:\n  - $s=0$: $p_1 \\ldots p_i = q_1 \\ldots q_i$\n  - $s=1$: $p_1 \\ldots p_i <_{lex} q_1 \\ldots q_i$ (and will remain so)\n  - $s=2$: $p_1 \\ldots p_i >_{lex} q_1 \\ldots q_i$ (and will remain so)\n\nThe values for $j$ range from $-M$ to $M$. We can offset it by $M$ to make it non-negative.\n$f[i][j+M][s]$: number of ways to choose $p_1, \\ldots, p_i$ and $q_1, \\ldots, q_i$ such that:\n1. $p_1 \\ldots p_i$ and $q_1 \\ldots q_i$ are permutations of $i$ distinct values chosen from $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$.\n2. $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_i) - inv(q_1 \\ldots q_i) = j$.\n3. Lexicographical state is $s$.\n\nThis DP is still too complex because the actual values chosen for $p_1 \\ldots p_i$ and $q_1 \\ldots q_i$ matter for future inversion counts.\nThe standard way to handle this is to use ranks. $p_1 \\ldots p_i$ is a permutation of $i$ items chosen from $n$ total items.\nLet $dp[k][\\text{diff}]$ be the number of pairs of permutations $(p_1 \\ldots p_k, q_1 \\ldots q_k)$ of $k$ distinct elements (from $\\{1 \\ldots k\\}$ for simplicity) such that $inv(p_1 \\ldots p_k) - inv(q_1 \\ldots q_k) = \\text{diff}$.\nThis requires $dp[k][\\text{diff}]$ to store information about $p_1 \\ldots p_k$ compared to $q_1 \\ldots q_k$.\n\nLet's simplify the problem.\nTotal number of pairs $(p,q)$ is $(n!)^2$.\nTotal number of pairs $(p,q)$ with $p <_{lex} q$ is $N_{<_{lex}} = \\frac{(n!)^2 - n!}{2}$.\nTotal number of pairs $(p,q)$ with $inv(p) > inv(q)$ is $N_{>inv}$.\nTotal number of pairs $(p,q)$ with $inv(p) = inv(q)$ is $N_{=inv} = \\sum_{j=0}^M dp[n][j]^2$.\nBy symmetry, $N_{>inv} = N_{<inv}$.\n$N_{>inv} = \\frac{(n!)^2 - N_{=inv}}{2}$. (This division by 2 is problematic if $mod$ is even).\n\nLet $T = (n!)^2$.\nLet $A = \\sum_{p,q: p <_{lex} q} 1 = \\frac{T - n!}{2}$.\nLet $B = \\sum_{p,q: inv(p) > inv(q)} 1 = \\frac{T - \\sum_{j=0}^M dp[n][j]^2}{2}$.\nWe are looking for $C = \\sum_{p,q: p <_{lex} q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1$.\n$A+B-C = \\sum_{p,q: p <_{lex} q \\text{ or } inv(p) > inv(q)} 1$.\n$C = A + B - (\\text{Total} - \\sum_{p,q: p \\ge_{lex} q, inv(p) \\le inv(q)} 1)$. No, this is not useful.\n\nLet $f[i][j]$ be the number of permutations of $i$ elements with $j$ inversions.\nLet $g[i][j]$ be the number of permutations of $i$ elements with at most $j$ inversions (prefix sums of $f[i]$).\nLet $h[i][j]$ be the number of permutations of $i$ elements with at least $j$ inversions.\n\nConsider a pair $(p,q)$.\nLet $k$ be the first index where $p_k \\neq q_k$.\nThen $p_1 = q_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1} = q_{k-1}$, and $p_k < q_k$.\nLet $P_{k-1} = (p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1})$.\nLet $S_{rem} = \\{1, \\ldots, n\\} \\setminus \\{p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1}\\}$.\nThe values $p_k, q_k$ must be chosen from $S_{rem}$.\nLet $p_k = x, q_k = y$ where $x, y \\in S_{rem}$ and $x < y$.\nThe remaining $n-k$ elements for $p$ are chosen from $S_{rem} \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Let $S_p = S_{rem} \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\nThe remaining $n-k$ elements for $q$ are chosen from $S_{rem} \\setminus \\{y\\}$. Let $S_q = S_{rem} \\setminus \\{y\\}$.\n\nThe contribution of $P_{k-1}$ to inversions in $p$ is $inv(P_{k-1}) + \\sum_{j=k}^n (\\text{number of } l < k \\text{ s.t. } p_l > p_j)$.\nThis sum $\\sum_{j=k}^n (\\text{number of } l < k \\text{ s.t. } p_l > p_j)$ is hard to work with.\n\nA crucial observation for this problem is that the values $p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1}$ being fixed does not simplify the inversion count for the suffix $p_k, \\ldots, p_n$ much, because the actual values $p_j$ for $j \\ge k$ still interact with $p_l$ for $l < k$.\nHowever, the $k$ elements $p_1, \\ldots, p_k$ have specific values. The remaining $n-k$ elements $p_{k+1}, \\ldots, p_n$ are a permutation of $n-k$ specific values from $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\} \\setminus \\{p_1, \\ldots, p_k\\}$.\nLet $inv(p)$ be the sum of $p_i - (\\text{number of elements before } p_i \\text{ that are smaller than } p_i)$. This is not right.\nThe number of inversions for a permutation $a_1, \\ldots, a_m$ can be calculated as $\\sum_{i=1}^m (\\text{number of elements } x \\in \\{1, \\ldots, a_i-1\\} \\text{ that appear to the right of } a_i)$. This is not right.\nThe number of inversions is $\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\text{number of } j<i \\text{ such that } p_j > p_i)$.\n\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of permutations of $i$ elements with $j$ inversions.\nLet $S[i][j]$ be the prefix sums for $dp[i][\\cdot]$: $S[i][j] = \\sum_{x=0}^j dp[i][x]$.\nLet $T[i][j]$ be the suffix sums for $dp[i][\\cdot]$: $T[i][j] = \\sum_{x=j}^{i(i-1)/2} dp[i][x]$.\n\nThe problem can be solved by iterating over $k$ (the first differing index) from $1$ to $n$.\nFor each $k$:\n  Iterate over $p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1}$ (which are equal to $q_1, \\ldots, q_{k-1}$).\n  This is too much. Instead, iterate over the values $v_1, \\ldots, v_{k-1}$ chosen for $p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1}$.\n  This is also too much.\n\nThe total number of permutations is $n!$.\nThe total number of inversions for all permutations is $n! \\cdot \\frac{n(n-1)}{4}$.\nThe sum of inversions for all permutations is $\\frac{n!(n(n-1))}{4}$.\n\nLet's define $dp[i][j]$ as the number of permutations of $i$ elements with $j$ inversions, as previously.\nLet $dp\\_sum[i][j]$ be $\\sum_{k=0}^j dp[i][k]$.\nLet $dp\\_sum\\_inv[i][j]$ be $\\sum_{k=0}^j k \\cdot dp[i][k]$.\n\nThe total number of pairs $(p,q)$ is $(n!)^2$.\nThe number of pairs $(p,q)$ where $p <_{lex} q$ is $((n!)^2 - n!)/2$.\nThe number of pairs $(p,q)$ where $inv(p) > inv(q)$ is $((n!)^2 - \\sum_{j=0}^{M} dp[n][j]^2)/2$.\nLet $ANS$ be the final answer.\nLet $Total = (n!)^2$.\nLet $SumPinv = \\sum_{p} inv(p)$.\n$SumPinv = n! \\cdot n(n-1)/4$.\nLet $SumQinv = \\sum_{q} inv(q)$.\n$SumQinv = n! \\cdot n(n-1)/4$.\n\nLet's define $f[i][j][\\text{state}]$ as the number of ways to pick $p_1 \\ldots p_i$ and $q_1 \\ldots q_i$ using $i$ distinct numbers from $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that $p_1 \\ldots p_i$ has $j$ inversions, and state indicates $p \\text{ vs } q$ lexicographically.\nThis is not feasible because the $i$ distinct numbers are not necessarily $1, \\ldots, i$.\n\nThe correct DP state for this type of problem is usually $dp[i][j]$ where $i$ is the length of prefix considered, and $j$ is the sum of inversions.\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of permutations of $i$ elements with $j$ inversions.

If we insert it at position $s_q$ (0-indexed from right), it adds $s_q$ inversions.\nThe new difference is $j + s_p - s_q$.\nThe lexicographical comparison also changes.\n\nLet $dp[i][j][0]$ be the number of pairs of permutations $(p,q)$ of $1 \\ldots i$ such that $p=q$ and $inv(p)-inv(q)=j$. This means $j=0$ and $dp[i][0][0] = i!$.\nLet $dp[i][j][1]$ be the number of pairs of permutations $(p,q)$ of $1 \\ldots i$ such that $p<_{lex}q$ and $inv(p)-inv(q)=j$.\nLet $dp[i][j][2]$ be the number of pairs of permutations $(p,q)$ of $1 \\ldots i$ such that $p>_{lex}q$ and $inv(p)-inv(q)=j$.\n\nBase case: $dp[0][0][0] = 1$ (empty permutations, 0 inversions, equal). All others 0.\nMax diff is $M = n(n-1)/2$. Offset $j$ by $M$.\n$dp[i][j+M][s]$\nFor $i = 0 \\ldots N-1$:\n  For $j = -i(i-1)/2 \\ldots i(i-1)/2$:\n    For $s_p = 0 \\ldots i$: (position for $i+1$ in $p$)\n      For $s_q = 0 \\ldots i$: (position for $i+1$ in $q$)\n        new\\_j = $j + s_p - s_q$.\n        If $dp[i][j+M][0]$: (current $p=q$)\n          If $s_p < s_q$: $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1] + dp[i][j+M][0]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n          If $s_p > s_q$: $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][2] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][2] + dp[i][j+M][0]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n          If $s_p = s_q$: $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][0] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][0] + dp[i][j+M][0]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n        If $dp[i][j+M][1]$: (current $p<_{lex}q$)\n          $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1] + dp[i][j+M][1]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n        If $dp[i][j+M][2]$: (current $p>_{lex}q$)\n          $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][2] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][2] + dp[i][j+M][2]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n\nThe complexity of this DP is $N \\times (2M) \\times 3 \\times (N+1) \\times (N+1) = O(N^3 M)$.\n$500^3 \\cdot 125000 \\approx 1.5 \\cdot 10^{13}$, which is too slow.\n\nThe issue is that $dp[i][j+M][0]$ is not $i!$. It is the number of pairs of permutations $(p,q)$ of $1 \\ldots i$ such that $p=q$ and $inv(p)-inv(q)=j$. This means $j$ MUST be 0.\nSo $dp[i][0+M][0]$ is $i!$. All other $dp[i][j+M][0]$ for $j \\neq 0$ are 0.\nThis simplifies the first transition:\nIf $dp[i][0+M][0]$:\n  For $s_p = 0 \\ldots i$:\n    For $s_q = 0 \\ldots i$:\n      new\\_j = $s_p - s_q$.\n      If $s_p < s_q$: $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1] + dp[i][0+M][0]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n      If $s_p > s_q$: $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][2] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][2] + dp[i][0+M][0]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n      If $s_p = s_q$: $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][0] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][0] + dp[i][0+M][0]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n\nThis is still $O(N^3 M)$. The sum over $s_p, s_q$ can be optimized.\nThe sum $\\sum_{s_p=0}^i \\sum_{s_q=0}^i \\ldots$ can be computed faster.\nLet $C_0 = \\sum_{s_p=0}^i dp[i][j+M][0] \\pmod{mod}$ (this is $i!$ if $j=0$, else 0).\nFor $s_p=s_q$: there are $i+1$ such pairs. $dp[i+1][j+M][0]$ gets $(i+1) \\cdot C_0$.\nFor $s_p < s_q$: For a fixed $s_p$, $s_q$ can be $s_p+1, \\ldots, i$. There are $i-s_p$ such values.\nTotal pairs $(s_p, s_q)$ with $s_p < s_q$ is $i(i+1)/2$.\nFor $s_p > s_q$: Total pairs $(s_p, s_q)$ with $s_p > s_q$ is $i(i+1)/2$.\n\nLet $count[diff]$ be the number of pairs $(s_p, s_q)$ such that $s_p - s_q = diff$ for $s_p, s_q \\in [0, i]$.\n$diff$ ranges from $-i$ to $i$.\nFor $diff = 0$, $s_p=s_q$, so $i+1$ pairs.\nFor $diff > 0$: $s_p = s_q + diff$. $s_q$ ranges from $0$ to $i-diff$. So $i-diff+1$ pairs.\nFor $diff < 0$: $s_q = s_p - diff$. $s_p$ ranges from $0$ to $i+diff$. So $i+diff+1$ pairs.\nThis $count[diff]$ can be precomputed in $O(N^2)$ for all $i$.\nThen the transition for $dp[i][0+M][0]$ becomes:\n  $val = dp[i][0+M][0]$.\n  For $diff = -i \\ldots i$:\n    new\\_j = $diff$.\n    If $diff < 0$: $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1] + val \\cdot count[diff]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n    If $diff > 0$: $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][2] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][2] + val \\cdot count[diff]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n    If $diff = 0$: $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][0] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][0] + val \\cdot count[diff]) \\pmod{mod}$.\nThis part is $O(N \\cdot N) = O(N^2)$.\n\nThe transitions for $dp[i][j+M][1]$ and $dp[i][j+M][2]$ are:\n  $val1 = dp[i][j+M][1]$\n  $val2 = dp[i][j+M][2]$\n  For $s_p = 0 \\ldots i$:\n    For $s_q = 0 \\ldots i$:\n      new\\_j = $j + s_p - s_q$.\n      $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1] + val1) \\pmod{mod}$.\n      $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][2] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][2] + val2) \\pmod{mod}$.\nThis sum is $(i+1)^2 \\cdot val1$ and $(i+1)^2 \\cdot val2$.\nSo, $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1]$ gets $val1 \\cdot (i+1)^2$ and $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][2]$ gets $val2 \\cdot (i+1)^2$.\nNo, this is wrong. The $j$ needs to be maintained.\nThe sum over $s_p, s_q$ is still $O(N^2)$ for each $(i,j)$.\nThis means $O(N \\cdot M \\cdot N^2) = O(N^3 M)$.\n\nThis is the standard $O(N^3 M)$ DP. The only way it passes is if $M$ is smaller (easy version) or the constant factor is very small. $N=500$ means $M \\approx 125000$.\n$500^3 \\cdot 125000$ operations is too much.\n\nThere must be a way to optimize the sum $\\sum_{s_p=0}^i \\sum_{s_q=0}^i dp[i][j+s_p-s_q+M][\\text{state}]$.\n$dp[i+1][j'+M][1] = \\sum_{j} \\sum_{s_p=0}^i \\sum_{s_q=0}^i dp[i][j+M][1]$ where $j' = j+s_p-s_q$.\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$dp[i+1][j'+M][1] = \\sum_{s_p=0}^i \\sum_{s_q=0}^i dp[i][j'-(s_p-s_q)+M][1]$.\nLet $diff = s_p - s_q$.\n$dp[i+1][j'+M][1] = \\sum_{diff = -i}^i \\text{count}[i][diff] \\cdot dp[i][j'-diff+M][1]$.\nHere $count[i][diff]$ is the number of pairs $(s_p, s_q)$ such that $0 \\le s_p, s_q \\le i$ and $s_p - s_q = diff$.\nThis is a convolution!\n$dp[i+1][\\cdot][1]$ is a convolution of $dp[i][\\cdot][1]$ with $count[i][\\cdot]$.\nThis can be computed in $O(M \\log M)$ with FFT, but $mod$ is not prime.\nIt can be computed in $O(M \\cdot N)$ for each $i$ using direct sum.\n$N \\cdot (M \\cdot N) = O(N^2 M)$.\n$500^2 \\cdot 125000 \\approx 3 \\cdot 10^{10}$. Still too slow.\n\nThe only way $O(N^2 M)$ is feasible is if $N$ is small, say $N=50$.\nFor $N=500$, $O(N^2)$ or $O(N^3)$ is the target.\n$O(N^3)$ is $500^3 = 1.25 \\cdot 10^8$.\n\nLet's recheck the DP state $dp[i][j]$ for permutations of $i$ elements with $j$ inversions.\n$dp[i][j] = \\sum_{k=0}^{i-1} dp[i-1][j-k]$.\nThis is $dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j] - dp[i-1][j-i]$ (using prefix sums).\nThis computes $dp[i]$ from $dp[i-1]$ in $O(M)$ time.\nTotal precomputation for $dp$ table is $O(N M)$. This is fine.\n\nThe problem requires $p <_{lex} q$ and $inv(p) > inv(q)$.\nLet $P_i$ be the set of all permutations of $i$ elements.\nLet $S_{inv}(i, j)$ be the set of permutations in $P_i$ with $j$ inversions. $|S_{inv}(i,j)| = dp[i][j]$.\nTotal answer $ANS = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{p_1 \\ldots p_i} \\sum_{x \\in S_{rem}} \\sum_{y \\in S_{rem}, x<y} \\text{count for } p_{i+1} \\ldots p_N, q_{i+1} \\ldots q_N$.\nThis is the standard approach for lexicographical problems.\nIterate $k$ from $1$ to $N$. $k$ is the first index where $p_k \\neq q_k$.\nSo $p_1=q_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1}=q_{k-1}$.\nFor $p_k < q_k$.\nLet $P_{k-1} = (p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1})$.\nLet $inv\\_prefix = inv(P_{k-1})$.\nThe available numbers for positions $k \\ldots N$ are $U = \\{1, \\ldots, N\\} \\setminus \\{p_1, \\ldots, p_{k-1}\\}$.\nChoose $p_k, q_k \\in U$ such that $p_k < q_k$.\nLet $S_p = U \\setminus \\{p_k\\}$ and $S_q = U \\setminus \\{q_k\\}$.\nFor any $v \\in U$, let $C(v) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} [p_j > v]$. This is the number of inversions $v$ forms with the prefix $P_{k-1}$.\n$inv(p) = inv\\_prefix + C(p_k) + \\sum_{v \\in p_{k+1} \\ldots p_N} C(v) + inv(p_{k+1} \\ldots p_N \\text{ as perm of } S_p)$.\n$inv(q) = inv\\_prefix + C(q_k) + \\sum_{v \\in q_{k+1} \\ldots q_N} C(v) + inv(q_{k+1} \\ldots q_N \\text{ as perm of } S_q)$.\nThis $\\sum C(v)$ term is the killer. It depends on actual values.\n\nThe key property for $N \\le 500$ is that we can afford $O(N^3)$ or $O(N^4)$ if the constant factor is very small.\nThe $dp[i][j]$ table is $N \\times M$.\nThe total number of pairs $(p,q)$ is $N!^2$.\nThe total number of inversions is $N(N-1)/2$.\nLet $f[i][\\text{inv_p}][\\text{inv_q}][\\text{lex_state}]$ be the number of pairs $(p,q)$ of prefixes of length $i$ such that $p,q$ use $i$ distinct elements from $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$, $inv(p)=\\text{inv_p}$, $inv(q)=\\text{inv_q}$, and they satisfy lex_state.\nThis is $N \\times M \\times M \\times 3$. Too large.\n\nThe sum of $inv(p)$ for all permutations $p$ of $n$ elements is $n! \\times n(n-1)/4$.\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of permutations of $i$ elements with $j$ inversions.\nFinal answer is $\\sum_{p <_{lex} q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1$.\nThis can be written as $Total - \\sum_{p \\ge_{lex} q \\text{ or } inv(p) \\le inv(q)} 1$.\n\nLet $count[i][j]$ be the number of permutations of $i$ elements with $j$ inversions.\n$count[i][j]$ is what I called $dp[i][j]$.\nMaximum inversions for $N$ elements is $M = N(N-1)/2$.\nLet $f[i][j]$ be the number of pairs of permutations $(p,q)$ of $1, \\ldots, i$ such that $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$, and $inv(p) - inv(q) = j$.\nThe range of $j$ is $[-M, M]$. Offset by $M$.\n$f[i][j+M]$ is the required DP state.\nTo compute $f[i][j+M]$ from $f[i-1][\\cdot][\\cdot]$ states:\nWe are inserting $i$ into permutations of $1, \\ldots, i-1$.\nLet $(p', q')$ be a pair of permutations of $1, \\ldots, i-1$.\nLet $s_p$ be the number of inversions created by inserting $i$ into $p'$.\nLet $s_q$ be the number of inversions created by inserting $i$ into $q'$.\n$s_p, s_q \\in [0, i-1]$.\nThe new $inv(p)$ is $inv(p') + s_p$.\nThe new $inv(q)$ is $inv(q') + s_q$.\nThe new difference is $j' = j + s_p - s_q$.\nThe new lexicographical state:\n1. If $p'=q'$: $p<_{lex} q$ if $s_p < s_q$. $p>_{lex} q$ if $s_p > s_q$. $p=q$ if $s_p = s_q$.\n2. If $p'<_{lex} q'$: $p<_{lex} q$ regardless of $s_p, s_q$.\n3. If $p'>_{lex} q'$: $p>_{lex} q$ regardless of $s_p, s_q$.\n\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of pairs $(p,q)$ of permutations of $1, \\ldots, i$ such that $p=q$ and $inv(p)-inv(q)=j$. This means $j=0$.

The $N^2$ loop over $s_p, s_q$ can be optimized.\nThe inner loops are computing convolutions.\nLet $C[diff]$ be the number of pairs $(s_p, s_q)$ s.t. $s_p - s_q = diff$ for $s_p, s_q \\in [0, i]$.\nThis is $C[diff] = i - |diff| + 1$.\nFor $dp[i][j+M]$:\n  $val = dp[i][j+M]$.\n  For $diff = -i \\ldots i$:\n    new\\_j = $diff$.\n    If $diff < 0$: $dp\\_less[i+1][new\\_j+M] = (dp\\_less[i+1][new\\_j+M] + val \\cdot C[diff]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n    If $diff > 0$: $dp\\_greater[i+1][new\\_j+M] = (dp\\_greater[i+1][new\\_j+M] + val \\cdot C[diff]) \\pmod{mod}$.\n    If $diff = 0$: $dp[i+1][new\\_j+M] = (dp[i+1][new\\_j+M] + val \\cdot C[diff]) \\pmod{mod}$.\nThis takes $O(N)$ for each $j$. Total $O(N \\cdot N)$.\nFor $dp\\_less[i][j+M]$:\n  $val = dp\\_less[i][j+M]$.\n  For $diff = -i \\ldots i$:\n    new\\_j = $j + diff$.\n    $dp\\_less[i+1][new\\_j+M] = (dp\\_less[i+1][new\\_j+M] + val \\cdot C[diff]) \\pmod{mod}$.\nThis takes $O(N)$ for each $j$. Total $O(M \\cdot N)$.\nSame for $dp\\_greater$.\nTotal complexity $O(N \\cdot M \\cdot N) = O(N^2 M)$. Still too much.\n\nThe problem states $N \\le 500$. This implies $O(N^3)$ is the target. $M$ is $N^2/2$.\nSo $O(N^2 M)$ is $O(N^4)$.\nThe $O(N^2 M)$ complexity is correct. The example $N=4$ has $M=6$. $4^2 \\cdot 6 = 96$. This is small.\nFor $N=500$, $N^2 M = 500^2 \\cdot 125000 = 250000 \\cdot 125000 = 3.125 \\cdot 10^{10}$. This is definitely too slow.\n\nCould it be that $M$ is not $N(N-1)/2$ but $N$? This is for $N$ items, each can take $N$ values.\nNo, $M$ is $N(N-1)/2$.\n\nThis is a known problem pattern. The $O(N^2 M)$ DP is usually optimized to $O(N^3)$ by observing that the range of $j$ for $dp[i][j]$ is $O(i^2)$, so the convolution is over $O(i^2)$ elements.\nThe transitions are:\n$dp[i+1][new\\_j+M][1] += \\sum_{diff} \\text{count}[i][diff] \\cdot dp\\_less[i][new\\_j-diff+M][1]$.\nThis is a convolution. Let $A_i(x) = \\sum_j dp\\_less[i][j+M][1] x^j$. Let $C_i(x) = \\sum_{diff} \\text{count}[i][diff] x^{diff}$.\nThen $A_{i+1}(x) = A_i(x) \\cdot C_i(x)$.\nThe $C_i(x)$ polynomial has degree $i$. The $A_i(x)$ polynomial has degree $i(i-1)/2$.\nThe product $A_i(x) \\cdot C_i(x)$ has degree $i(i-1)/2 + i = i(i+1)/2$.\nMultiplying two polynomials of degree $D_1, D_2$ takes $O(D_1 D_2)$ time.\nHere, $D_1 \\approx i^2/2$, $D_2 \\approx i$. So $O(i^3)$ for each $i$.\nTotal time for this part: $\\sum_{i=1}^N O(i^3) = O(N^4)$. Still too slow.\nFFT would make it $O(i^2 \\log i)$, total $O(N^3 \\log N)$. Still too slow.\n\nThe only way $O(N^3)$ could work is if $M$ is not $N(N-1)/2$ but $N$.\nOr if the $M$ in $O(NM)$ is actually $N$.\nLet $S_i$ be the sum of $dp\\_less[i][j+M]$ over all $j$.\n$S_{i+1} = S_i \\cdot (i+1)^2$. This is correct.\nThe $dp[i][j+M]$ part (when $p=q$) only has $j=0$.\n$dp[i+1][0+M] = dp[i][0+M] \\cdot C[i][0] = dp[i][0+M] \\cdot (i+1)$.\nSo $dp[i][0+M] = (i+1)!$. Correct.\n\nThe problem implies $O(N^3)$ or $O(N^2)$ solution.\nThe standard approach for $N^3$ inversion DP involves $dp[i][j]$ for permutations of $i$ elements with $j$ inversions.\nLet $f[i][\\text{diff}]$ be sum for $p<_{lex}q$.\n$f[i][\\text{diff}] = \\sum_{diff'} f[i-1][\\text{diff}-diff'] \\cdot \\text{count}[i-1][diff']$. This is $O(i^2 \\cdot i) = O(i^3)$.\nThis is the convolution step.\nThe total sum $f[N][j]$ for $j>0$ is the answer.\nThe total time for the DP is $O(N^4)$.\nThe hard version implies $N=500$ should pass.\nThe $O(N^4)$ solution is too slow. $500^4 = 6.25 \\cdot 10^{10}$.\n\nThere must be some property that reduces the complexity.\nPerhaps the problem is equivalent to counting something else.\n$A = \\sum_{p,q: p <_{lex} q} 1$.\n$B = \\sum_{p,q: inv(p) > inv(q)} 1$.\n$C = \\sum_{p,q: p <_{lex} q, inv(p) > inv(q)} 1$.\nConsider $X = \\sum_{p,q: p <_{lex} q, inv(p) < inv(q)} 1$.\nConsider $Y = \\sum_{p,q: p <_{lex} q, inv(p) = inv(q)} 1$.\n$A = X+Y+C$.\nBy symmetry, if $(p,q)$ is counted in $X$, then $(q,p)$ is counted in $C$ (if $inv(q)>inv(p)$).\nIf $p<_{lex}q$ and $inv(p)<inv(q)$, then $q>_{lex}p$ and $inv(q)>inv(p)$.\nThis means $X = \\sum_{q,p: q >_{lex} p, inv(q) > inv(p)} 1$.\nThe total number of pairs is $(n!)^2$.\nLet $N_{<L, >I}$ be $C$.\nLet $N_{<L, <I}$ be $X$.\nLet $N_{<L, =I}$ be $Y$.\nLet $N_{=L, >I}$ be $0$.\nLet $N_{=L, <I}$ be $0$.\nLet $N_{=L, =I}$ be $\\sum_j dp[n][j]^2$.\nLet $N_{>L, >I}$ be $\\sum_{q>_{lex}p, inv(p)>inv(q)} 1$. This is $X$.\nLet $N_{>L, <I}$ be $C$.\nLet $N_{>L, =I}$ be $Y$.\n\nTotal $(n!)^2 = C + X + Y + X + C + Y + \\sum_j dp[n][j]^2$.\n$(n!)^2 = 2C + 2X + 2Y + \\sum_j dp[n][j]^2$.\nWe need $C$.\n$C + X + Y = ((n!)^2 - n!)/2$.\n$C+X = ((n!)^2 - \\sum_j dp[n][j]^2)/2$.\nThis implies $Y = n!/2 - (\\sum_j dp[n][j]^2)/2$. This is not helpful.\n\nThe problem might be using a specific property of permutations.\nThe only way $O(N^3)$ is achievable is if the maximum number of inversions is $O(N)$.\nBut it is $O(N^2)$.\nThe $O(N^3)$ solutions usually involve a fixed element $i$ and its position.\nThis problem is likely an $O(N^3)$ solution with a clever DP state or transition.\n\nFinal check on the $O(N^2 M)$ DP for $N=500$.\n$N=500$, $M=124750$.\n$N^2 M = 500^2 \\times 124750 \\approx 3.1 \\times 10^{10}$.\nThis is too large for 1-2 seconds.\nThe only way this passes is if $M$ is effectively much smaller for most $i$, or if the constraints are actually smaller.\nThe hard version is $N=500$.\nThe easy version is $N=50$. For $N=50$, $M = 50 \\times 49 / 2 = 1225$.\n$N^2 M = 50^2 \\times 1225 = 2500 \\times 1225 \\approx 3 \\times 10^6$. This is perfectly fine for $N=50$.\nSo the $O(N^2 M)$ DP is the intended solution for the easy version.\nFor the hard version, it must be $O(N^3)$ or $O(N^2 \\log N)$.\n\nThis implies that the range of $j$ for $dp[i][j]$ is not $M$, but $N$.\nThe difference $inv(p)-inv(q)$ is bounded by $M$.\nThe number of inversions can be calculated as $\\sum_{i=1}^n (p_i - (\\text{number of elements } x < p_i \\text{ that appear to the left of } p_i) - 1)$. No.\nNumber of inversions is $\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\text{number of elements } x < p_i \\text{ that are placed to the right of } p_i)$.\n\nThe solution for $N=500$ must be $O(N^3)$. This means the $M$ in $O(N^2 M)$ must be $O(N)$.\nThis is only true if we are not tracking the exact inversion counts, but something else related to inversions that has a smaller range.\nThe problem is hard because of the $N=500$ constraint.\n\nLet $dp[i][j]$ be the number of permutations of $i$ elements with $j$ inversions.\nThe actual answer is $\\sum_{j=1}^{M} dp\\_less[N][j+M]$.\nThis requires summing up all $dp\\_less[N][j+M]$ where $j>0$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, mod = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # dp[i][j] = number of permutations of i elements with j inversions\n    # max_inversions[i] = i * (i - 1) // 2\n    max_total_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n\n    # dp_inv[i][j] stores count of permutations of length i with j inversions\n    dp_inv = [[0] * (max_total_inv + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp_inv[0][0] = 1\n\n    # pref_dp_inv[i][j] stores sum of dp_inv[i][k] for k <= j\n    pref_dp_inv = [[0] * (max_total_inv + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    pref_dp_inv[0][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        current_max_inv = i * (i - 1) // 2\n        for j in range(current_max_inv + 1):\n            # dp_inv[i][j] = sum(dp_inv[i-1][j-k] for k in 0...i-1)\n            # This is equivalent to pref_dp_inv[i-1][j] - pref_dp_inv[i-1][j-i]\n            val = pref_dp_inv[i-1][j]\n            if j - i >= 0:\n                val = (val - pref_dp_inv[i-1][j-i] + mod) % mod\n            dp_inv[i][j] = val\n        \n        pref_dp_inv[i][0] = dp_inv[i][0]\n        for j in range(1, current_max_inv + 1):\n            pref_dp_inv[i][j] = (pref_dp_inv[i][j-1] + dp_inv[i][j]) % mod\n\n    # dp_eq[i][j_diff + M]: Number of pairs (p,q) of permutations of 1..i\n    #                       such that p=q, and inv(p)-inv(q) = j_diff.\n    #                       This implies j_diff must be 0.\n    # dp_less[i][j_diff + M]: Number of pairs (p,q) of permutations of 1..i\n    #                        such that p <_lex q, and inv(p)-inv(q) = j_diff.\n    # dp_greater[i][j_diff + M]: Number of pairs (p,q) of permutations of 1..i\n    #                           such that p >_lex q, and inv(p)-inv(q) = j_diff.\n\n    offset = max_total_inv # To handle negative j_diff\n\n    # Initialize dp tables for i=0\n    # For i=0, empty permutations p=\"\", q=\"\". inv(p)=0, inv(q)=0. p=q. j_diff=0.\n    dp_eq = [[0] * (2 * max_total_inv + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp_less = [[0] * (2 * max_total_inv + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp_greater = [[0] * (2 * max_total_inv + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n    dp_eq[0][0 + offset] = 1 # One way for empty permutations, diff 0\n\n    # Max diff for i elements is i*(i-1)/2.
