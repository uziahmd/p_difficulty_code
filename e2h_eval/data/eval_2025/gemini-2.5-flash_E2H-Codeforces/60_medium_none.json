Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this Morse code problem:**\n\nI need to develop a Python solution to count distinct sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a string `S`, as it's built up by adding '0's and '1's. The crucial part is to handle these counts efficiently and keep the distinctness in mind.\n\nFirst, I need to really understand the problem. I'm given an empty string `S` that grows with each input ('0' or '1'). After each addition, I have to calculate the total count of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed from any substring of `S`. I know that:\n\n*   English letters are encoded by strings of '0's and '1's.\n*   These codes have lengths between 1 and 4.\n*   There are 4 invalid Morse code strings.\n*   I have to apply modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nI'm interpreting a \"sequence of English letters\" to mean concatenating these Morse code strings. For instance, if \"1\" is 'T' and \"11\" is 'M', then \"TM\" is \"111\". The count I need is the *distinct* number of such sequences across all substrings of the evolving string.\n\n**Here's the approach I am considering:**\n\nInitially, a dynamic programming approach seemed like the way to go. I thought about `dp[i]` representing the distinct sequences formed by the prefix `S[0...i-1]`. But that doesn't quite work because the requirement is about substrings, not just prefixes. Another thought was to have `dp[i]` represent distinct sequences formed by the suffix `S[i...len(S)-1]`. However, that also is not solving the requirement for *any* substring.\n\nInstead, I have to focus on the substrings of `S`. The idea is to calculate `ways(sub)`, which represents the number of distinct ways to interpret a given substring `sub` as a sequence of English letters. The overall answer will involve summing this for all possible substrings of `S`.\n\nI'm going to calculate `ways(sub)` using dynamic programming. If `sub` has length `L`, then `dp_sub[i]` will hold the number of ways to parse the prefix `sub[0...i-1]` (where `dp_sub[0]` = 1, since the empty prefix can be an empty string). I can efficiently compute `dp_sub[i]` by considering valid Morse codes of lengths 1 to 4 that end at `i-1`. The final `ways(sub)` will be `dp_sub[L]`.\n\nNow, the trick is to do this for *all* substrings. As the string S grows, the key here is to keep track of distinct substrings, because if a substring is already accounted for, I shouldn't add it to the count again, as it gives the same number of sequences.\n\nSo, for each new character appended to S, I'll identify new substrings that end at that character. For these new substrings, I'll calculate `ways()` and check if this substring has already been seen. If it is new, then I will add its sequence to the cumulative answer.\n\nThe critical issue is to implement both a way to calculate `ways(sub)` and a way to keep track of distinct substrings. The time complexity seems like it could blow up quickly, so I need to be careful with the implementation.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of distinct non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by *any* substring of `S`, after each character ('0' or '1') is appended to `S`. The answer should be modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what \"distinct non-empty sequences of English letters\" means. If a sequence of letters, say \"ABC\", can be formed by parsing `S[i...j]` and also by parsing `S[p...q]`, it should only be counted once. The problem statement implies a crucial property: \"each string of '0' and/or '1' of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter\". This means that for any sequence of English letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_k`, its Morse code representation `M(L_1) + M(L_2) + ... + M(L_k)` is unique. Therefore, if a sequence `Q` can be represented by a substring `sub_1` and also by `sub_2`, then `sub_1` must be identical to `sub_2`.\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly: we need to find all *distinct substrings* of `S` that can be parsed into a sequence of English letters. For each such distinct substring `X`, we count the number of ways `X` can be parsed into a sequence of English letters. The final answer is the sum of these counts for all distinct parseable substrings `X`.\n\nLet `ways(X)` be the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by parsing the string `X`.\nWe can compute `ways(X)` using dynamic programming:\nLet `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse the prefix `X[0...i-1]`.\n`dp[0] = 1` (representing an empty sequence, base case for starting a parse).\nFor `i` from 1 to `len(X)`:\n  `dp[i] = 0`\n  For `l` from 1 to 4 (possible lengths of a single Morse code letter):\n    If `i - l >= 0` and `X[i-l ... i-1]` is a valid Morse code for an English letter:\n      `dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i-l]) % MOD`\nThen `ways(X) = dp[len(X)]`.\n\nThe `valid_morse_codes` are all binary strings of length 1 to 4, except for \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". We can precompute this set.\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n1.  Initialize `S` as an empty string.\n2.  Initialize `total_ans = 0`.\n3.  Initialize `seen_substrings = set()` to store distinct substrings for which we've already added `ways(sub)` to `total_ans`.\n4.  For each of the `m` modifications:\n    a.  Append the new character (`'0'` or `'1'`) to `S`. Let `k` be the new length of `S`.\n    b.  We need to consider all new substrings that end at the current position `k-1`. These are `S[j ... k-1]` for `j` from `0` to `k-1`.\n    c.  For each `j` from `k-1` down to `max(0, k-4)`: (Since a single Morse code letter has max length 4, we only need to consider substrings of length up to 4 for single letters. For longer substrings, their `ways` value depends on shorter substrings.)\n        i.  Let `sub = S[j ... k-1]`.\n        ii. If `sub` is not in `seen_substrings`:\n            1.  Calculate `ways(sub)` using the DP approach described above.\n            2.  Add `ways(sub)` to `total_ans`.\n            3.  Add `sub` to `seen_substrings`.\n    d.  Print `total_ans`.\n\n**Optimization for calculating `ways(sub)` and avoiding `O(M^3)` complexity:**\nThe current string `S` has length `k`. When a new character `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S'`.\nWe are interested in `ways(S'[j...k])` for all `j` from `0` to `k`.\nLet `dp_suffix[j]` be `ways(S'[j...k])`.\nThis is equivalent to `ways(S'[j...k])` where `S'[j...k]` is considered as a prefix.\nWe can compute `dp_suffix` values for all substrings ending at `k` efficiently.\nLet `current_S` be the string `S`.\nLet `dp_current_suffix_vals[j]` be `ways(current_S[j...k-1])`.\nWhen `char` is appended, `current_S` becomes `S + char`. Let its new length be `k_new`.\nWe need to calculate `ways(S[j...k_new-1])` for `j = 0 ... k_new-1`.\nFor each `j` from `k_new-1` down to `0`:\n  `sub = S[j...k_new-1]`\n  If `sub` is not in `seen_substrings`:\n    `seen_substrings.add(sub)`\n    `val = 0`\n    If `j == k_new-1`: // substring of length 1\n        If `S[k_new-1]` is a valid Morse code: `val = 1`\n    Else: // substring of length > 1\n        For `l` from 1 to 4:\n            If `k_new - l >= j` and `S[k_new-l ... k_new-1]` is a valid Morse code:\n                `val = (val + ways(S[j ... k_new-l-1])) % MOD` (This is `dp_current_suffix_vals[j]` for the substring `S[j...k_new-l-1]`)\n        `ways(sub) = val`\n    `total_ans = (total_ans + ways(sub)) % MOD`\n\nThis still seems to require `ways(S[j ... k_new-l-1])` which is a previous `dp_current_suffix_vals` entry.\nLet `f[i]` be the number of ways to parse `S[i...current_len-1]`.\nWhen `S` grows by one char `c` to `S_new`, its length becomes `current_len`.\nWe want to calculate `ways(S_new[j...current_len-1])` for all `j`.\nLet `current_parse_counts[j]` be `ways(S_new[j...current_len-1])`.\n`current_parse_counts[current_len] = 1` (base case for parsing an empty string).\nFor `j` from `current_len-1` down to `0`:\n  `current_parse_counts[j] = 0`\n  For `l` from 1 to 4:\n    If `j+l <= current_len` and `S_new[j...j+l-1]` is a valid Morse code:\n      `current_parse_counts[j] = (current_parse_counts[j] + current_parse_counts[j+l]) % MOD`\n\nNow, how to use `seen_substrings`?\nFor each `j` from `0` to `current_len-1`:\n  Let `sub = S_new[j...current_len-1]`.\n  If `sub` not in `seen_substrings`:\n    `seen_substrings.add(sub)`\n    `total_ans = (total_ans + current_parse_counts[j]) % MOD`\n\nThis approach still has `O(M^2)` substrings, and each `sub` can be up to `M` characters long. Storing `M^2` strings in a set is `O(M^3)` space and `O(M^3)` time for hashing. This is too slow. `M=3000` means `9 * 10^9` operations for `M^3`.\n\nThe maximum length of `S` is 3000. `M^2` substrings is `9 * 10^6`.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code for a single letter is 4. This is a very small number.\n\nLet's use a string hashing approach to represent substrings and check for seen substrings.\nWe can use polynomial hashing with two different prime moduli to minimize collisions.\nFor a string `s`, its hash `H(s) = (s[0] * P^(L-1) + s[1] * P^(L-2) + ... + s[L-1] * P^0) % M`.\nWhen appending `char` to `S`, say `S_old` becomes `S_new`.\nFor each `j` from `k_new-1` down to `0`:\n  `sub = S_new[j...k_new-1]`\n  We can compute hashes for `sub` in `O(1)` time from the hash of `S_new[j+1...k_new-1]`.\n  Or, we can compute hashes for `S_new[j...k_new-1]` from `S_new[j...k_new-2]` in `O(1)` using rolling hash.\n  Let `h[j]` be the hash of `S_new[j...k_new-1]`.\n  `current_hash = 0`\n  For `j` from `k_new-1` down to `0`:\n    `current_hash = (current_hash + (S_new[j] * P^(k_new-1-j))) % MOD` (This is not a rolling hash for suffixes)\n\nA better way for rolling hash for suffixes:\nLet `S_new_char_val[idx]` be `1` if `S_new[idx]` is '1', else `0`.\n`suffix_hash[j]` is hash of `S_new[j...k_new-1]`.\n`suffix_hash[k_new-1] = S_new_char_val[k_new-1]`.\nFor `j` from `k_new-2` down to `0`:\n  `suffix_hash[j] = (S_new_char_val[j] * P + suffix_hash[j+1]) % MOD`.\nThis gives `O(M)` hashes for all suffixes ending at `k_new-1`.\nWe store `(hash1, hash2)` pairs in `seen_substrings`.\n\nSo, the optimized algorithm:\n1.  Precompute `valid_morse_codes` set.\n2.  Initialize `S = []` (list of chars for efficient append).\n3.  Initialize `total_ans = 0`.\n4.  Initialize `seen_hashes = set()` to store `(hash1, hash2)` pairs of distinct substrings.\n5.  Choose two large prime moduli `MOD1, MOD2` and bases `P1, P2`.\n6.  `parse_counts = [0] * (M + 1)` (stores `ways(S[j...k-1])` for current `k`).\n\n7.  For each of the `m` modifications (new char `c`):\n    a.  Append `c` to `S`. Let `k` be the new length of `S`.\n    b.  `parse_counts[k] = 1` (base case for empty suffix).\n    c.  Initialize `h1 = 0`, `h2 = 0`, `p1_pow = 1`, `p2_pow = 1`.\n    d.  For `j` from `k-1` down to `0`:\n        i.  `char_val = int(S[j])`.\n        ii. Update rolling hashes for `S[j...k-1]`:\n            `h1 = (char_val * p1_pow + h1) % MOD1`\n            `h2 = (char_val * p2_pow + h2) % MOD2`\n            `p1_pow = (p1_pow * P1) % MOD1`\n            `p2_pow = (p2_pow * P2) % MOD2`\n\n        iii. Calculate `parse_counts[j]`:\n            `parse_counts[j] = 0`\n            For `l` from 1 to 4:\n                If `j+l <= k`:\n                    `sub_str = \"\".join(S[j : j+l])` (This creates string, slow)\n                    Instead, check `S[j:j+l]` directly.\n                    The `valid_morse_codes` should be represented by their actual strings, not hashes, for direct lookup.\n                    String slicing `S[j:j+l]` is fine for small `l`.\n                    If `sub_str` is in `valid_morse_codes`:\n                        `parse_counts[j] = (parse_counts[j] + parse_counts[j+l]) % MOD`\n\n        iv. If `(h1, h2)` is not in `seen_hashes`:\n            `seen_hashes.add((h1, h2))`\n            `total_ans = (total_ans + parse_counts[j]) % MOD`\n    e.  Print `total_ans`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis of Optimized Algorithm:**\n*   `m` iterations.\n*   Inside each iteration:\n    *   `k` (current length of `S`) loop for `j` from `k-1` down to `0`. `O(k)` iterations.\n    *   Hash calculation: `O(1)` per `j`.\n    *   `parse_counts[j]` calculation: Inner loop `l` from 1 to 4. `O(1)` string slice and set lookup. `O(1)` arithmetic. So `O(1)` per `j`.\n    *   `seen_hashes` lookup and insert: `O(1)` on average.\n*   Total time per iteration: `O(k)`.\n*   Total time for `m` iterations: `sum_{k=1 to m} O(k) = O(m^2)`.\n*   `m = 3000`, so `m^2 = 9 * 10^6`.
