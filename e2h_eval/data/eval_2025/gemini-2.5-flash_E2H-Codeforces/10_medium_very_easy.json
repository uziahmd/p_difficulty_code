Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Decoding the Golorp's Diet: A Thought Journey**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The challenge is feeding these Golorps, essentially solving a constraint satisfaction problem. I need a Python script to do this, and the Golorp's name is the key.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure: it's a string that looks like `?(expression):-constraints.`. The \"jaws\" of the Golorp, I'm interpreting this as the number of variables to be fed, the number of distinct values we need to find, `N`. These variables will take single-digit values (0-9).\n\nThe key here is how these variables relate to the underscores in the input. Initially, I thought each underscore might be a variable. But looking at the examples, I realized the *order and structure* of the underscores is crucial. The underscores are place holders for the variables `v0`, `v1`, ... `vN-1`, and we need to determine the value of `N`.\n\nMy current hypothesis is that the number of variables, `N`, is determined by counting *contiguous groups* of underscores within the expression section (the part between `?(` and `):-`). Let's say we have `k` contiguous groups of underscores in the expression. We will then assign these groups the variables `v0, ... vK-1`. Then, the underscores in both the expression and the constraints are replaced with the variables, cycling through from `v0` to `vK-1`.\n\nSo the first task is to parse the input, identify the expression part, count the underscore blocks, and substitute them with the variables `v0, v1, ..., v(N-1)`. The next task is to find the *lexicographically smallest* sequence of digit assignments to the variables that satisfies the constraints.\n\nThe expression part is just there as a calculation, but it doesn't need to return a specific value.\n\nIf this substitution works, the next task is searching the solution space, testing all possible assignments of values 0-9 for each variable `v_i` in a lexicographical order, which will be the order in which they get into the \"jaws.\" If I can't find a solution, the output is 'false'.\n\nThis interpretation sounds much cleaner than my initial approaches. I'll need to code this and test it out.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of single-digit variable values (0-9) that satisfy a given Golorp's \"diet\" (constraints). If no such sequence exists, we should output \"false\".\n\nThe Golorp's name follows a pattern: `?(EXPRESSION):-CONSTRAINTS.`\n\nLet's break down the interpretation based on the problem statement and examples:\n\n1.  **Variables and their Count (N):**\n    *   \"The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws.\"\n    *   The \"jaws\" refers to the `EXPRESSION` part of the name (between `?(` and `):-`).\n    *   Each contiguous block of underscores (`_`) within the `EXPRESSION` defines a distinct variable slot.\n    *   The total count of these distinct blocks of underscores in the `EXPRESSION` determines `N`, the number of variables (e.g., `v0, v1, ..., vN-1`).\n    *   Each `v_i` can take any integer value from 0 to 9.\n\n    *Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`*\n    *   `EXPRESSION`: `_-_/___*__`\n    *   Blocks of underscores in `EXPRESSION`: `_` (1st), `_` (2nd), `___` (3rd), `__` (4th).\n    *   So, `N=4`. We need to find values for `v0, v1, v2, v3`.\n\n2.  **Variable Assignment and Substitution:**\n    *   All contiguous blocks of underscores in the *entire Golorp name* (both `EXPRESSION` and `CONSTRAINTS`) refer to these `N` variables.\n    *   They are assigned cyclically: the 1st block of `_` refers to `v0`, the 2nd to `v1`, ..., the N-th to `vN-1`, the (N+1)-th to `v0`, and so on.\n    *   When substituting, each block of `_` is replaced by the *string representation* of its assigned variable (e.g., `_` becomes `str(v0)`). This is crucial because `eval()` expects numbers or variable names, not `_`.\n\n    *Example 1 (continued): `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`*\n    *   `N=4`, variables `v0, v1, v2, v3`.\n    *   Original string: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    *   Blocks in order:\n        1.  `_` (in `EXPRESSION`) -> `v0`\n        2.  `_` (in `EXPRESSION`) -> `v1`\n        3.  `___` (in `EXPRESSION`) -> `v2`\n        4.  `__` (in `EXPRESSION`) -> `v3`\n        5.  `___` (in `CONSTRAINTS`) -> `v0` (cycles back to `v0`)\n        6.  `__` (in `CONSTRAINTS`) -> `v1` (cycles back to `v1`)\n    *   The modified string for evaluation becomes: `?(v0-v1/v2*v3):-v0>v1.`\n\n3.  **Constraints Evaluation:**\n    *   The `EXPRESSION` part `(v0-v1/v2*v3)` simply defines a calculation. The problem does not state that this expression must evaluate to a specific value. It seems its purpose is only to define the *variables* and their context.\n    *   The `CONSTRAINTS` part (between `:-` and `.`) contains one or more comparison conditions separated by commas (`,`). All these conditions must evaluate to `True`.\n    *   **Special Case: Division by Zero:** If any `v_i` used as a divisor is 0, the expression is invalid. `eval()` will raise `ZeroDivisionError`. We must treat such cases as failing the constraints.\n\n4.  **Lexicographical Smallest Sequence:**\n    *   Since we need the lexicographically smallest sequence, we should iterate through possible variable values using nested loops, starting `v0` from 0, then `v1` from 0, and so on. The first combination of values that satisfies all constraints is our answer.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Parse the input string:**\n    *   Find the `EXPRESSION` part: substring between `?(` and `):-`.\n    *   Find the `CONSTRAINTS` part: substring between `:-` and `.`.\n    *   Store the original string as `full_name`.\n\n2.  **Determine N (number of variables):**\n    *   Use `re.findall(r'_+', expression_part)` to find all contiguous blocks of underscores in the `EXPRESSION`.\n    *   `N = len(list_of_blocks)`.\n\n3.  **Prepare for substitution:**\n    *   Create a list `var_names = [f'v{i}' for i in range(N)]`.\n    *   Find all blocks of underscores in the `full_name` using `re.finditer(r'_+', full_name)`. Store their start/end indices and the corresponding `var_names[i % N]`.\n\n4.  **Iterate and test:**\n    *   Use `itertools.product(range(10), repeat=N)` to generate all possible combinations of `N` digits (0-9). This ensures lexicographical order.\n    *   For each combination `values = (v0, v1, ..., vN-1)`:\n        a.  **Substitute values:** Create a modified string for evaluation. Iterate through the `full_name` and replace each `_` block with the `str(values[i % N])` corresponding to its assigned variable.\n        b.  **Extract and evaluate constraints:**\n            *   Find the `CONSTRAINTS` part in the *substituted* string.\n            *   Split it by `,` to get individual constraint strings.\n            *   For each constraint string:\n                *   Try to `eval()` it.\n                *   Catch `ZeroDivisionError` (if any `v_i` is 0 and is a divisor) or any other `Exception` (e.g., `SyntaxError` if values lead to invalid operations like `1/0`). If an error occurs, this `values` combination is invalid.\n                *   If `eval()` returns `False`, this `values` combination is invalid.\n            *   If all constraints evaluate to `True` without errors, then `values` is a valid solution.\n\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   If a valid `values` combination is found, join its digits into a string and print it. Then terminate.\n    *   If the loop finishes without finding any valid combination, print \"false\".\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    golorp_name = input()\n\n    # 1.
