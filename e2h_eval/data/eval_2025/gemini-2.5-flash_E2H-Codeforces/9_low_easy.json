Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Selling Souvenirs Problem with Python**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem.  It's a knapsack variation, which I'm familiar with.  Let's break it down:  I've got `n` souvenirs, and each has a weight (`w_i`) and a cost (`c_i`).  The total weight can't exceed `m`.  Simple enough. I need to maximize the total cost.\n\nThe initial concern is the scale.  `n` and `m` are pretty large, which usually screams \"dynamic programming\", but traditional DP with O(n*m) complexity would be a killer here.  Too many operations.\n\nThen I noticed something crucial: the weights are tiny!  Each `w_i` is either 1, 2, or 3.  Bingo! That's the key. This allows for a major optimization.\n\nI'm thinking I'll categorize the souvenirs by their weights.  Let's make three lists: `costs_w1`, `costs_w2`, and `costs_w3`.  Each list will store the costs of souvenirs of weight 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Then, to maximize the total cost, I'll sort each list in descending order.  This ensures I always prioritize the most valuable items within each weight category.\n\nNow, it boils down to selecting the right number of items from each category: `k1` (weight 1 items), `k2` (weight 2 items), and `k3` (weight 3 items).  We need to ensure the total weight remains within the limit `m`. The total weight constraint becomes: `1 * k1 + 2 * k2 + 3 * k3 <= m`. The total cost would then be the sum of costs for the selected items in each category.\n\nThe upper limits are clear: `k1 <= m`, `k2 <= m/2`, and `k3 <= m/3`. But, even with these limits, trying *every* possible combination of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` would still be computationally expensive, given that `m` is up to 300,000. It is similar to a knapsack problem with a limited number of item types but a large capacity. I need to figure out a smart way to find the optimal combination.  There must be some way to prune the search space intelligently given the limited number of possible weights.  That's where the next level of optimization lies.\n",
