The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, this problem seems straightforward enough. We're given a ring road with 'n' houses, and 'm' tasks that Xenia needs to complete in a specific order.  The key is to minimize the total time, and the only movement allowed is clockwise. My immediate thought is to trace Xenia's movements house by house and keep track of the cumulative time.\n\nLet's start by defining our variables: 'n' for houses, 'm' for tasks, and an array 'a' representing the target house for each task. Xenia begins at house 1, so 'current_location' = 1. I'll need a 'total_time' variable to accumulate the time spent.\n\n**Movement Logic**\n\nNow, the core of the problem lies in calculating the time for each move. It's essentially the clockwise distance between two houses. If the target house for the next task ('target_location') is ahead of or equal to 'current_location', the time is simply the difference. However, if 'target_location' is behind 'current_location', she has to go all the way around the ring. This scenario warrants special consideration.\n\nWe can represent this logic with a simple conditional statement: If 'target_location >= current_location', the time is `target_location - current_location`. Otherwise, if 'target_location < current_location', the time taken is `(n - current_location) + target_location`, which effectively wraps around the ring.\n\n**Implementation and Testing**\n\nI'll iterate through the tasks in 'a', apply this movement logic for each task, and keep updating 'total_time' and 'current_location'.  Let's test this with the examples given to make sure everything lines up. The logic seems correct after thorough testing.\n\n**Optimization Considerations**\n\nThe problem has reasonable constraints (n, m <= 10^5). This means I can use an O(m) algorithm, which should be efficient enough.\n\nAs for potential integer overflow with large numbers, Python's integers handle arbitrary sizes, so I don't need to worry about that. A simple `print` statement will handle large integer output.\n\n**Final Code and Review**\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll write a Python script that reads the input, implements the movement logic, and outputs the total time. The comments I put in were for my own thought process. It's now clean and ready to go.\n",
