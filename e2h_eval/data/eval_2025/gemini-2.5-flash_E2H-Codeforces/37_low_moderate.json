    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Gluttony\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Gluttony\" problem. The core of it is building a permutation `b` of an input array `a` such that the sums of elements in any proper, non-empty subset of indices are different between `a` and `b`. The constraint on the size of the array is interesting, it's pretty small. The number of possible subsets grows, but it's still manageable.\n\nMy initial thought is that simply swapping elements randomly won't cut it. There's probably a more structured approach needed to guarantee the subset sums are distinct. The problem mentions competitive programming. A common strategy there is to sort the given array and then figure out the permutation based on the sorted order. Let me think, sorting the input array won't change the underlying problem, finding a suitable permutation of the *original* input, because it is just re-indexing. If I have a sorted array, `a`, can I then devise a permutation `b` that fits the distinct sum criteria?\n\nThe condition that `sum(a[xi]) != sum(b[xi])` for all non-empty subsets is pretty daunting. Maybe I can simplify it.  What if I try something like a cyclic shift?  Let's say `b = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`. I need to check if this works.  Let's test with small cases for `n` to look for patterns. If `n=1`, there are no subsets to even check! That's easy. If `n=2`, I'll need to check the single element subsets. If I permute it with b = [a1, a0], that should work. So the cyclic shift *could* be a starting point, or a pattern in the overall solution. I'll need to work out a more concrete idea of how to relate `b` to `a`.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements at these positions in `a` is different from the sum of elements at these positions in `b`. That is, `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`. The array `a` contains `n` distinct integers, and `n` is small (`n <= 22`).\n\nLet's analyze the condition `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`.\nThis condition must hold for all `S` where `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nConsider the simplest non-trivial permutation: a cyclic shift.\nLet `a` be sorted: `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.\nLet `b` be a cyclic shift of `a` by one position to the left: `b = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\nThis means `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]` for all `i`.\n\nLet's check this specific `b`.\nFor any subset of indices `S`, we need `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`.\nSubstituting `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]`, the condition becomes:\n`sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} a[(i+1) % n]`\n\nThis strategy is known to work for this type of problem. The intuition is that by shifting elements, we are likely to change the sum for most subsets. Because `a` contains distinct integers, `a_i` are all different. If `a` is sorted, then `a_0` is the smallest and `a_{n-1}` is the largest. By moving `a_0` to the end and shifting others, we are replacing `a_i` with `a_{i+1}` for `i < n-1` and `a_{n-1}` with `a_0`. This tends to change subset sums significantly.\n\nThe problem statement provides `a` as an arbitrary array. We need to output a permutation `b` of this `a`.\nA standard approach is to:\n1. Store the original array `a` along with its original indices.\n2. Sort `a` to get `a_sorted` and keep track of the original indices.\n3. Construct `b_sorted` by cyclically shifting `a_sorted`. Specifically, `b_sorted[i] = a_sorted[(i+1) % n]`.\n4. Reconstruct `b` based on the original indices. If `a_sorted[j]` was originally at `a[k]`, then `b[k]` should be `b_sorted[j]`.\n\nLet's formalize step 2 and 3:\n1. Create a list of pairs `(value, original_index)` from `a`. For example, `items = [(a[0], 0), (a[1], 1), ..., (a[n-1], n-1)]`.\n2. Sort `items` based on `value`. This gives `sorted_items = [(val_0, idx_0), (val_1, idx_1), ..., (val_{n-1}, idx_{n-1})]`, where `val_0 < val_1 < ... < val_{n-1}`.\n3. Initialize an empty array `b` of size `n`.\n4. For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`:\n   The element `val_i` (which is `sorted_items[i][0]`) is placed at its original position `sorted_items[i][1]` in the sorted version of `a`.\n   In `b`, this position `sorted_items[i][1]` should receive the value `val_{(i+1)%n}` (which is `sorted_items[(i+1)%n][0]`).\n   So, `b[sorted_items[i][1]] = sorted_items[(i+1)%n][0]`.\n\nThis construction guarantees that `b` is a permutation of `a`.\nThe problem asks if there is *any* such array `b`. The cyclic shift construction is known to always work for `n > 1`.\nFor `n = 1`, the condition `0 < k < n` means there are no such subsets `S`. So any `b` (which must be `a` itself) is valid. The cyclic shift `b[0] = a[0]` works.\n\nExample: `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n1. `items = [(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n2. `sorted_items = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   So, `val_0=1, idx_0=3`; `val_1=10, idx_1=2`; `val_2=100, idx_2=1`; `val_3=1000, idx_3=0`.\n3. Initialize `b = [0, 0, 0, 0]` (or any placeholder).\n4. Construct `b`:\n   - For `i=0`: `sorted_items[0]` is `(1, 3)`. Original index for `1` was `3`.\n     `b[sorted_items[0][1]] = sorted_items[(0+1)%4][0]`\n     `b[3] = sorted_items[1][0] = 10`\n   - For `i=1`: `sorted_items[1]` is `(10, 2)`. Original index for `10` was `2`.\n     `b[sorted_items[1][1]] = sorted_items[(1+1)%4][0]`\n     `b[2] = sorted_items[2][0] = 100`\n   - For `i=2`: `sorted_items[2]` is `(100, 1)`. Original index for `100` was `1`.\n     `b[sorted_items[2][1]] = sorted_items[(2+1)%4][0]`\n     `b[1] = sorted_items[3][0] = 1000`\n   - For `i=3`: `sorted_items[3]` is `(1000, 0)`. Original index for `1000` was `0`.\n     `b[sorted_items[3][1]] = sorted_items[(3+1)%4][0]`\n     `b[0] = sorted_items[0][0] = 1`\n\n   So `b` becomes `[1, 1000, 100, 10]`.\n   The example output is `100 1 1000 10`. This is also a valid permutation. This demonstrates that multiple answers can exist. The cyclic shift approach provides one such valid answer.\n\n   Let's recheck the example output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]` with our construction logic:\n   `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\n   `sorted_items = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   `b` elements are `[100, 1, 1000, 10]`.\n   `b[0]` (original position of 1000) is `100`. This means `a_sorted[2]` (`100`) goes to `a_original[0]` (`1000`).\n   `b[1]` (original position of 100) is `1`. This means `a_sorted[0]` (`1`) goes to `a_original[1]` (`100`).\n   `b[2]` (original position of 10) is `1000`. This means `a_sorted[3]` (`1000`) goes to `a_original[2]` (`10`).\n   `b[3]` (original position of 1) is `10`. This means `a_sorted[1]` (`10`) goes to `a_original[3]` (`1`).\n\n   This suggests a different mapping: `b[original_index_of_val_i] = val_{(i+k)%n}` for some fixed `k`.\n   Our construction: `b[original_index_of_val_i] = val_{(i+1)%n}`.\n   The example output corresponds to `b[original_index_of_val_i] = val_{(i+2)%n}` (a shift by 2 positions).\n   Let's check this:\n   - `i=0`: `val_0=1` (original index 3). `b[3] = val_{(0+2)%4} = val_2 = 100`.\n   - `i=1`: `val_1=10` (original index 2). `b[2] = val_{(1+2)%4} = val_3 = 1000`.\n   - `i=2`: `val_2=100` (original index 1). `b[1] = val_{(2+2)%4} = val_0 = 1`.\n   - `i=3`: `val_3=1000` (original index 0). `b[0] = val_{(3+2)%4} = val_1 = 10`.\n   This results in `b = [10, 1, 1000, 100]`. This is not the example output either.\n\n   The example output `[100, 1, 1000, 10]` comes from:\n   `a[0]=1000` maps to `b[0]=100` (which is `a[1]`)\n   `a[1]=100` maps to `b[1]=1` (which is `a[3]`)\n   `a[2]=10` maps to `b[2]=1000` (which is `a[0]`)\n   `a[3]=1` maps to `b[3]=10` (which is `a[2]`)\n   This is a permutation `P` such that `b[i] = a[P[i]]`. Specifically, `b[0]=a[1], b[1]=a[3], b[2]=a[0], b[3]=a[2]`.\n   This is also a valid permutation. The key is that the cyclic shift on the *sorted* values is a robust strategy.\n\nThe logic `b[original_index_of_val_i] = val_{(i+1)%n}` is correct and simpler to implement.\nLet's trace it again for `a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`.\n1. `items = [(1000, 0), (100, 1), (10, 2), (1, 3)]`\n2. `sorted_items = [(1, 3), (10, 2), (100, 1), (1000, 0)]`\n   `val_0=1, idx_0=3`\n   `val_1=10, idx_1=2`\n   `val_2=100, idx_2=1`\n   `val_3=1000, idx_3=0`\n3. `b = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n4. Fill `b`:\n   `b[idx_0] = val_1` => `b[3] = 10`\n   `b[idx_1] = val_2` => `b[2] = 100`\n   `b[idx_2] = val_3` => `b[1] = 1000`\n   `b[idx_3] = val_0` => `b[0] = 1`\n   Result: `b = [1, 1000, 100, 10]`. This is a valid answer.\n\nFinal check for constraints: `n <= 22`. Sorting takes `O(N log N)`. Constructing `b` takes `O(N)`. This is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        # For n=1, there are no non-empty proper subsets of indices (0 < k < n is not met).\n        # So, any permutation works, which means b must be a itself.\n        print(a[0])\n        return\n\n    # Create a list of (value, original_index) pairs\n    items = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        items.append((a[i], i))\n\n    # Sort these items based on their values\n    # sorted_items will be [(val_0, idx_0), (val_1, idx_1), ..., (val_{n-1}, idx_{n-1})]\n    # where val_0 < val_1 < ... < val_{n-1}\n    sorted_items = sorted(items)\n\n    # Initialize the result array b\n    b = [0] * n\n\n    # Construct b using a cyclic shift strategy\n    # For each element (val_i, original_idx_i) in sorted_items,\n    # its original position (original_idx_i) in array 'a' will be filled\n    # with the value of the next element in sorted_items (val_{(i+1)%n}).\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_val = sorted_items[i][0]\n        original_idx = sorted_items[i][1]\n        \n        next_val_idx = (i + 1) % n\n        next_val = sorted_items[next_val_idx][0]\n        \n        b[original_idx] = next_val\n\n    # Print the resulting array b\n    print(*(b))\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
