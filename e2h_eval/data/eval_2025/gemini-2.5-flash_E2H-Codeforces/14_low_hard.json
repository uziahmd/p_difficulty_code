He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Tackling the Trailing Zeroes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem and need a Python script to solve it.  The core of the issue is figuring out the values of `n` for which `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes.  It's all about that classic factorial and those pesky zeroes.\n\nThe key insight is that the number of trailing zeroes is completely determined by the number of factors of 5 in `n!`.  We've got the standard reasoning: there are always more factors of 2 than 5, so the number of 5s dictates the number of 10s we can form, and thus the number of zeroes. I need to calculate the factors of 5 efficiently.\n\nLegendre's Formula comes to mind: `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`.  This is our tool to count those factors. I can see that `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function; as `n` grows, `Z(n)` either stays the same or increases. I need to keep this in mind.\n\nNow, this is where it gets interesting.  `Z(n)` only jumps at multiples of 5, and it jumps by increasing amounts for multiples of powers of 5 (25, 125, etc.). I know that the function has gaps. It doesn't take every integer value.  For instance, there is no `n` for which `Z(n) = 5`. I'll need to figure out what values `m` can even have, since the range will be limited by this observation.\n\nSo, I need to find the `n` values where `Z(n)` equals the given `m`. Given the nature of `Z(n)`, I believe there might be a range of n-values for any given m. This range depends on the \"gaps\" in the function values.\n",
