The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this coding challenge.**\n\nMy goal is to figure out the probability of a working tower setup. I'm given towns from 0 to n+1, with towers potentially built in towns 1 to n.  The key is that towns 0 and n+1 can't get any signal, and the other towns must get signal from exactly one tower each.  The towers have a probability of 1/2 of existing.  A tower at town 'i' with power 'p' covers the towns 'i-p+1' to 'i+p-1'.\n\nFirst, the power 'p' must be at most min(i, n+1-i). This ensures 0 and n+1 aren't covered.  The towers must cover a contiguous range from towns 1 to n, and these ranges must be disjoint.\n\nThe sum of the lengths covered by each tower's reach must be 'n'.  A tower at 'i' with power 'p' covers '2p-1' towns, therefore, `sum (2p_i - 1) = n`.\n\nI'm thinking about the boundaries between the towns and how the tower signals interact. The union of these signals must partition `[1,n]`, the towns in between, with each town only being covered by one tower.\n\nThis leads me to a condition where, the endpoints of the intervals between towers `(i-p, i+p)` must \"line up\". This means the intervals must be disjoint and tile the range `(0, n+1)`.\nNow, my thoughts are that the only way for the towers to exist is if there is some sequence of values `0 = y_0 < y_1 < ... < y_k = n+1`, representing the tower edges, where the towers are at the midpoints of these intervals.\n\nSpecifically, a tower can only be at `i` where its power `p` is set such that there are only even integers in the gaps, or odd integer lengths.\n\nFrom this thinking, to ensure `0=y_0` and `y_k=n+1`, if `0` is even, we must also ensure that `n+1` is of the same parity.  Otherwise, the probability is 0.\n\nSo, the values `y_j` must all have the same parity. Since `y_0 = 0`, they must all be even.\n\nThis means that `n+1` must be even, or `n` is odd.\nThis makes sense, as a single tower covers exactly an odd number of cities (2*p-1). So, the sum of lengths must sum to an odd number.\n\nTherefore, `n` must be an odd number (which means `n+1` is even). If `n` is even, the probability is `0`.\n\nIf `n` is odd, then the problem is more complicated. We can only construct configurations where towers and powers form a partition of the intervals. To ensure each `p_j` is at least 1, the difference between consecutive intervals must be at least 2.\n\nIn summary, the crux is understanding the constraints on signal power to ensure that all towers must form a contiguous and complete partitioning, and then calculate the probability.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the probability that, given a random selection of towers, we can assign signal powers to satisfy certain conditions. Towers are built in towns $1, 2, \\dots, n$ with probability $1/2$ independently.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of towns where towers are built. For each $k \\in S$, we must choose an integer signal power $p_k \\in [1, n]$.\nThe conditions are:\n1. Towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal.\n2. Towns $1, 2, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\n\nA tower at town $k$ with signal power $p_k$ covers towns $c$ such that $|c - k| < p_k$. This means it covers the integer towns in the open interval $(k-p_k, k+p_k)$, which are $k-p_k+1, \\dots, k+p_k-1$. Let $L_k = k-p_k+1$ and $R_k = k+p_k-1$.\n\nCondition 1 implies:\n- For any $k \\in S$, $0$ is not covered: $k-p_k \\ge 0 \\implies p_k \\le k$.\n- For any $k \\in S$, $n+1$ is not covered: $k+p_k \\le n+1 \\implies p_k \\le n+1-k$.\nCombining these, $p_k \\le \\min(k, n+1-k)$. Since $p_k \\ge 1$, we must have $\\min(k, n+1-k) \\ge 1$, which is true for $k \\in [1, n]$.\nThese conditions ensure that all towns covered by any tower are within $[1, n]$.\n\nCondition 2 implies that the intervals $[L_k, R_k]$ for $k \\in S$ must form a partition of the set of towns $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. This means:\n- The union of all $[L_k, R_k]$ for $k \\in S$ must be exactly $[1, n]$.\n- The intervals $[L_k, R_k]$ must be disjoint.\n\nLet $s_1 < s_2 < \\dots < s_m$ be the towns where towers are built ($S = \\{s_1, \\dots, s_m\\}$). Let $p_1, \\dots, p_m$ be their respective signal powers.\nThe partition condition implies:\n1. The first interval must start at $1$: $L_1 = s_1 - p_1 + 1 = 1 \\implies p_1 = s_1$.\n2. The last interval must end at $n$: $R_m = s_m + p_m - 1 = n \\implies p_m = n - s_m + 1$.\n3. For $j = 1, \\dots, m-1$, adjacent intervals must meet: $R_j + 1 = L_{j+1}$.\n   $(s_j + p_j - 1) + 1 = (s_{j+1} - p_{j+1} + 1) \\implies s_j + p_j = s_{j+1} - p_{j+1} + 1$.\n\nNow, let's incorporate the $p_k \\le \\min(k, n+1-k)$ constraints:\n- For $p_1 = s_1$: $s_1 \\le \\min(s_1, n+1-s_1) \\implies s_1 \\le n+1-s_1 \\implies 2s_1 \\le n+1$.\n- For $p_m = n-s_m+1$: $n-s_m+1 \\le \\min(s_m, n+1-s_m) \\implies n-s_m+1 \\le s_m \\implies n+1 \\le 2s_m$. (The other part $n-s_m+1 \\le n+1-s_m$ is $1 \\le 1$, which is always true).\n\nConsider the sequence of right endpoints $R_0 = 0, R_1, \\dots, R_m = n$.\nFrom $R_j+1 = L_{j+1}$, we can write $L_j = R_{j-1}+1$ for $j=1, \\dots, m$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of $L_j$: $s_j - p_j + 1 = R_{j-1}+1 \\implies p_j = s_j - R_{j-1}$.\nSubstituting $p_j$ into $R_j = s_j + p_j - 1$: $R_j = s_j + (s_j - R_{j-1}) - 1 = 2s_j - R_{j-1} - 1$.\nThis gives $s_j = (R_j + R_{j-1} + 1)/2$.\n\nFor $s_j$ to be an integer, $R_j + R_{j-1} + 1$ must be even. This means $R_j$ and $R_{j-1}$ must have different parities.\nSince $R_0=0$ (even), $R_1$ must be odd, $R_2$ must be even, and so on. In general, $R_j$ must have parity $j \\pmod 2$.\nThus, $R_m = n$ must have parity $m \\pmod 2$. This implies that $n$ and $m$ must have the same parity.\n\nThe conditions $p_j \\ge 1$ and $p_j \\le \\min(s_j, n+1-s_j)$ are automatically satisfied if $R_j$ are strictly increasing integers from $0$ to $n$ with alternating parities.\n- $p_j = (R_j - R_{j-1} + 1)/2 \\ge 1 \\implies R_j - R_{j-1} + 1 \\ge 2 \\implies R_j - R_{j-1} \\ge 1$. This means $R_j$ must be strictly increasing.\n- $p_j \\le s_j \\implies (R_j - R_{j-1} + 1)/2 \\le (R_j + R_{j-1} + 1)/2 \\implies -R_{j-1} \\le R_{j-1} \\implies 2R_{j-1} \\ge 0 \\implies R_{j-1} \\ge 0$. This is true since $R_0=0$ and $R_j$ are increasing.\n- $p_j \\le n+1-s_j \\implies (R_j - R_{j-1} + 1)/2 \\le n+1 - (R_j + R_{j-1} + 1)/2 \\implies R_j - R_{j-1} + 1 \\le 2n+2 - R_j - R_{j-1} - 1 \\implies 2R_j \\le 2n \\implies R_j \\le n$. This is true for all $j \\le m$.\n\nSo, a configuration of towers $S=\\{s_1, \\dots, s_m\\}$ is valid if and only if there exists a sequence of integers $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_m=n$ such that:\n1. $R_j$ and $R_{j-1}$ have different parities for all $j=1, \\dots, m$. (This implies $R_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2$).\n2. The towns $s_j = (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2$ are exactly the towns in $S$.\n3. The towns $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus S$ are exactly the towns $k$ for which $k \\ne (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2$ for any $j$.\n\nThis means that for a valid configuration, we must be able to find a sequence $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_m=n$ with $R_j$ having parity $j \\pmod 2$. The towns $s_j$ are then uniquely determined as the midpoints of $(R_{j-1}, R_j+1)$.\nThe crucial observation is that $R_j$ and $R_{j-1}$ must have different parities. This means $R_j - R_{j-1}$ must be odd.\nSince $R_j - R_{j-1} = 2p_j - 1$, this implies $2p_j - 1$ must be odd, which is always true for any integer $p_j$.\nSo the condition $R_j$ and $R_{j-1}$ having different parities is just a restatement of $p_j$ being an integer.\n\nThe condition $R_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2$ implies $n=R_m$ must have parity $m \\pmod 2$.\nIf $n$ is even: $m$ must be even.\nIf $n$ is odd: $m$ must be odd.\n\nLet's consider the points $0, 1, \\dots, n, n+1$.\nA valid configuration corresponds to choosing a set of towers $S=\\{s_1, \\dots, s_m\\}$ such that there exist $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_m=n$ where $R_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2$, and $s_j = (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2$.\nThis implies that $s_j$ is the midpoint of the segment $[R_{j-1}+1, R_j]$.\nThe towns $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ that are *not* in $S$ are those that are not midpoints of such segments.\nThe set of possible midpoints $s_j$ is determined by the sequence $R_j$.\nFor a given sequence $R_0, \\dots, R_m$, the towers must be exactly at $s_1, \\dots, s_m$.\nThis means that for each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$, town $s_j$ must have a tower, and for any $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\setminus \\{s_1, \\dots, s_m\\}$, town $k$ must not have a tower.\n\nConsider the \"gaps\" between the towns. There are $n+1$ gaps: $(0,1), (1,2), \\dots, (n, n+1)$.\nA tower at $k$ with power $p_k$ \"covers\" the interval $(k-p_k, k+p_k)$.\nThe conditions mean that these intervals $(k-p_k, k+p_k)$ must form a partition of $(0, n+1)$.\nThis implies that the endpoints $0, n+1$ and $k \\pm p_k$ must be integers.\nLet $y_0=0 < y_1 < \\dots < y_m = n+1$ be the endpoints.\nThen for each interval $(y_j, y_{j+1})$, there is a tower at $k_j = (y_j+y_{j+1})/2$ with power $p_j = (y_{j+1}-y_j)/2$.\nFor $k_j$ and $p_j$ to be integers, $y_j+y_{j+1}$ and $y_{j+1}-y_j$ must both be even. This implies $y_j$ and $y_{j+1}$ must have the same parity.\nSince $y_0=0$ (even), all $y_j$ must be even.\nThus, $y_m=n+1$ must be even. This means $n$ must be odd.\n\nIf $n$ is even, $n+1$ is odd. Then this \"interval partitioning\" approach fails.\nLet's re-examine the example $n=2$. $n$ is even. $n+1=3$ is odd.\nThe solution says towers at $1, 2$ with powers $1, 1$ is valid.\n$s_1=1, p_1=1$. Interval $[1-1+1, 1+1-1] = [1,1]$.\n$s_2=2, p_2=1$. Interval $[2-1+1, 2+1-1] = [2,2]$.\nUnion is $[1,2]$. All conditions satisfied.\nHere $R_0=0, R_1=1, R_2=2$.\n$R_0=0$ (even), $R_1=1$ (odd), $R_2=2$ (even). This sequence of parities is $E, O, E$.\nThe towns are $s_1=(R_0+R_1+1)/2 = (0+1+1)/2 = 1$.\n$s_2=(R_1+R_2+1)/2 = (1+2+1)/2 = 2$.\nThis requires $s_1=1$ and $s_2=2$ to have towers.\nThis matches the $R_j$ having parity $j \\pmod 2$ logic, where $j$ is the index of $R_j$.\n\nThe problem essentially asks for the number of subsets $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ such that there exists a sequence $0=R_0 < R_1 < \\dots < R_m=n$ where $R_j$ has parity $j \\pmod 2$, and $S = \\{(R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2 \\mid j=1, \\dots, m\\}$.\nThe sequence $R_j$ is uniquely determined by $S$.\nThe number of elements in $S$ is $m$.\nThe sequence $R_j$ must have $R_j$ and $R_{j-1}$ of different parities.\nThis means $R_j - R_{j-1}$ must be odd.\nThe $s_j = (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2$.\nThe condition $R_j - R_{j-1}$ is odd means $R_j \\equiv R_{j-1}+1 \\pmod 2$.\n$R_0=0$. $R_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. $R_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. $R_3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nSo $R_j \\equiv j \\pmod 2$.\nTherefore, $R_m = n$ must have parity $m \\pmod 2$.\nThis means $n$ and $m$ must have the same parity.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of ways to pick $s_1, \\dots, s_m$ such that such a sequence $R_j$ exists.\nThe sequence $R_j$ is uniquely defined by the $s_j$.\n$R_0=0$.\n$R_1 = 2s_1-1$.\n$R_2 = 2s_2-R_1-1 = 2s_2-(2s_1-1)-1 = 2s_2-2s_1$.\n$R_3 = 2s_3-R_2-1 = 2s_3-(2s_2-2s_1)-1 = 2s_3-2s_2+2s_1-1$.\nIn general, $R_j = \\sum_{k=1}^j (-1)^{j-k}(2s_k-1)$.\nThe final condition is $R_m = n$.\n$n = \\sum_{k=1}^m (-1)^{m-k}(2s_k-1)$.\n\nThis is a known pattern related to compositions of $n$.\nThe number of valid sequences of $R_j$ is equivalent to the number of ways to write $n$ as an alternating sum of odd numbers.\nLet $A_j = R_j - R_{j-1}$. $A_j$ must be odd and positive.\n$n = \\sum_{j=1}^m A_j$. This is wrong.\n$R_j = R_{j-1} + A_j$.\n$n = R_m = R_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^m A_j = \\sum_{j=1}^m A_j$.\nThis means $n$ must be expressed as a sum of $m$ odd positive integers.\nIf $m$ is even, $n$ must be even. If $m$ is odd, $n$ must be odd. This is consistent with $n \\equiv m \\pmod 2$.\n\nThe number of ways to write $n$ as a sum of $m$ positive odd integers is given by $\\binom{(n-m)/2 + m - 1}{m-1} = \\binom{(n+m)/2 - 1}{m-1}$.\nThis is a standard stars and bars argument: let $A_j = 2x_j+1$ for $x_j \\ge 0$.\nThen $\\sum (2x_j+1) = n \\implies 2 \\sum x_j + m = n \\implies \\sum x_j = (n-m)/2$.\nWe need to distribute $(n-m)/2$ identical items into $m$ distinct bins, which is $\\binom{(n-m)/2 + m - 1}{m-1}$.\nThis is valid only if $n-m$ is even and non-negative, i.e., $n \\ge m$ and $n \\equiv m \\pmod 2$.\n\nFor each such composition $n = A_1 + \\dots + A_m$ (where $A_j$ are positive odd integers), we get a sequence $R_j$: $R_0=0, R_1=A_1, R_2=A_1+A_2, \\dots, R_m=A_1+\\dots+A_m=n$.\nThen the towers are at $s_j = (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2$.\nThe number of valid choices for $S$ is the total number of such compositions.\nWe need to sum over all possible $m$ with the same parity as $n$, and $m \\le n$.\nNumber of compositions of $n$ into $m$ odd parts is $\\binom{(n+m)/2-1}{m-1}$.\nThe total number of valid sets $S$ is $\\sum_{m \\le n, m \\equiv n \\pmod 2} \\binom{(n+m)/2-1}{m-1}$.\nLet $k = (n+m)/2$. Then $m = 2k-n$.\nSince $m \\ge 1$, $2k-n \\ge 1 \\implies k \\ge (n+1)/2$.\nSince $m \\le n$, $2k-n \\le n \\implies 2k \\le 2n \\implies k \\le n$.\nSo the sum is $\\sum_{k=\\lceil (n+1)/2 \\rceil}^{n} \\binom{k-1}{2k-n-1}$.\nThis is a known identity. $\\sum_{j=0}^{\\lfloor (N-1)/2 \\rfloor} \\binom{N-1-j}{j} = F_N$, where $F_N$ is the $N$-th Fibonacci number ($F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$).\nThe sum $\\sum_{m \\text{ s.t. } n \\equiv m \\pmod 2, 1 \\le m \\le n} \\binom{(n+m)/2-1}{m-1}$ is $F_{n+1}$.\nFor example:\n$n=1$: $m=1$. $\\binom{(1+1)/2-1}{1-1} = \\binom{0}{0} = 1$. $F_2=1$.\n$n=2$: $m=2$. $\\binom{(2+2)/2-1}{2-1} = \\binom{1}{1} = 1$. $F_3=2$.\n$n=3$: $m=1: \\binom{(3+1)/2-1}{1-1} = \\binom{1}{0} = 1$.\n        $m=3: \\binom{(3+3)/2-1}{3-1} = \\binom{2}{2} = 1$.\n        Total $1+1=2$. $F_4=3$.\n$n=4$: $m=2: \\binom{(4+2)/2-1}{2-1} = \\binom{2}{1} = 2$.\n        $m=4: \\binom{(4+4)/2-1}{4-1} = \\binom{3}{3} = 1$.\n        Total $2+1=3$. $F_5=5$.\n$n=5$: $m=1: \\binom{(5+1)/2-1}{1-1} = \\binom{2}{0} = 1$.\n        $m=3: \\binom{(5+3)/2-1}{3-1} = \\binom{3}{2} = 3$.\n        $m=5: \\binom{(5+5)/2-1}{5-1} = \\binom{4}{4} = 1$.\n        Total $1+3+1=5$. $F_6=8$.\n\nThe number of valid tower configurations is $F_{n+1}$.\nThe total number of possible tower configurations is $2^n$ (each of $n$ towns either has a tower or not).\nSo the probability is $F_{n+1} / 2^n$.\n\nWe need to calculate this modulo $998244353$.\nWe need to compute $F_{n+1}$ and $2^n \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThen $F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{998244353}$.\nThe Fibonacci numbers can be computed using matrix exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n$2^n$ can be computed using modular exponentiation in $O(\\log n)$ time.\nThe inverse $(2^n)^{-1}$ can be computed using Fermat's Little Theorem as $(2^n)^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD}$.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined as $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$.\nThe problem requires $F_{n+1}$.\nFor $n=1$, $F_2=1$. Probability $1/2^1 = 1/2$.\nExample $n=1$: Output $748683265$.\n$1/2 \\pmod{998244353} = 1 \\cdot 2^{MOD-2} \\pmod{MOD} = 1 \\cdot 2^{998244351} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$2^{998244351} \\pmod{998244353} = 499122177$.\nWait, example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$.\nFor $n=2$, $F_3=2$. Probability $2/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$.\nSo the example output $748683265$ corresponds to $1/2$.\nThis means my calculation for $F_{n+1}$ is correct.\n\nLet's check $n=3$. $F_4=3$. Probability $3/2^3 = 3/8$.\nExample $n=3$: Output $748683265$. This is $1/2$. My calculation is $3/8$.\nSomething is wrong.\nThe example output for $n=3$ is $748683265$. This is $1/2$.\nMy calculation for $n=3$ is $3/8$.\n$3/8 \\pmod{998244353} = 3 \\cdot 8^{MOD-2} = 3 \\cdot 8^{998244351} \\pmod{998244353}$.\n$8^{998244351} \\pmod{998244353} = 124780544$.\n$3 \\cdot 124780544 = 374341632$. This is not $748683265$.\n\nWhat could be wrong?\n\"The real answer for the second example is $1/4$: with probability $1/4$, the towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\"\nThis is for $n=2$. My $F_3/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$. My answer for $n=2$ is $1/2$. The example says $1/4$.\nThis means my interpretation of $F_{n+1}$ is off by a factor of $2$.\n\nLet's recheck the problem statement carefully.\n\"towns $0$ and $n+1$ don't get any signal\"\n\"towns $1, 2, \\dots, n$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each.\"\n\nThe $R_j$ sequence approach is standard for partitioning problems.\n$s_j = (R_j+R_{j-1}+1)/2$.\nThe set of towns $S$ where towers are built must be precisely $\\{s_1, \\dots, s_m\\}$.\nThis means that for a choice of $R_0, \\dots, R_m$, we must have towers at $s_1, \\dots, s_m$ and *no towers* at any other town $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThe previous derivation counted the number of valid sequences $R_j$, each of which implies a specific set of $m$ towers.\nFor each such sequence $R_j$, there is exactly one set of towers $S = \\{s_1, \\dots, s_m\\}$ that allows for a valid power assignment.\nThe probability for *this specific set* $S$ is $(1/2)^m \\cdot (1/2)^{n-m} = (1/2)^n$.\nSo if there are $N_{valid}$ such sets $S$, the total probability is $N_{valid} \\cdot (1/2)^n$.\nMy $N_{valid}$ was $F_{n+1}$.\n\nLet's look at $n=2$. $F_3=2$.\nThe two valid sequences $(R_0, R_1, R_2)$ are:\n1. $(0, 1, 2)$. This implies $s_1=(0+1+1)/2=1$, $s_2=(1+2+1)/2=2$. So $S=\\{1,2\\}$.\n2. $(0, 3, \\text{no } R_2=2)$. Oh, $R_m=n$ is the last point.\nThe sum formula $\\sum_{m \\le n, m \\equiv n \\pmod 2} \\binom{(n+m)/2-1}{m-1}$ counts compositions of $n$ into $m$ odd parts.\nFor $n=2$: $m=2$. $\\binom{(2+2)/2-1}{2-1} = \\binom{1}{1} = 1$.\nThis means there is only one sequence of $A_j$ (odd positive integers) such that $\\sum A_j = n$ and $m$ has the same parity as $n$.\nFor $n=2$, $m=2$. $A_1+A_2=2$. Since $A_j$ must be odd and positive, this is impossible. Smallest odd is $1$. $1+1=2$. So $A_1=1, A_2=1$. This is one way.\nThe sequence $R_j$ is $R_0=0, R_1=A_1=1, R_2=A_1+A_2=2$.\nThis leads to $S=\\{1,2\\}$. This is one valid set $S$.\nSo $N_{valid}=1$ for $n=2$. Probability $1/2^2 = 1/4$. This matches example!\n\nFor $n=3$: $m=1$ or $m=3$.\n$m=1$: $A_1=3$. One way. $R_0=0, R_1=3$. $s_1=(0+3+1)/2=2$. $S=\\{2\\}$.\n$m=3$: $A_1+A_2+A_3=3$. $A_j=1$. Only one way: $1+1+1=3$. $R_0=0, R_1=1, R_2=2, R_3=3$.\n$s_1=(0+1+1)/2=1, s_2=(1+2+1)/2=2, s_3=(2+3+1)/2=3$. $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$.\nSo for $n=3$, there are $1+1=2$ valid sets $S$.\n$N_{valid}=2$. Probability $2/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. This matches example!\n\nMy $N_{valid}$ is correct. It is $F_{n+1}$ using $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\n$F_1=1$ (for $n=1$). $N_{valid}=1$. Prob $1/2$.\n$F_2=1$ (for $n=2$). $N_{valid}=1$. Prob $1/4$.\n$F_3=2$ (for $n=3$). $N_{valid}=2$. Prob $1/4$.\n$F_4=3$ (for $n=4$). $N_{valid}=3$. Prob $3/16$.\n$F_5=5$ (for $n=5$). $N_{valid}=5$. Prob $5/32$. This matches example!\n\nSo the probability is $F_{n+1} / 2^n$.\nThe Fibonacci sequence: $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, \\dots$\nThis definition of Fibonacci is standard. Sometimes $F_1=1, F_2=1$ is used as the starting point, effectively shifting the indices. The problem uses $F_{n+1}$.\nFor $n=1$, need $F_2=1$.\nFor $n=2$, need $F_3=2$.\nFor $n=3$, need $F_4=3$.\nThis means $F_k$ is the $k$-th Fibonacci number where $F_1=1, F_2=1$.\nIf $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$ then $F_{n+1}$ is correct.\n\nMatrix exponentiation for Fibonacci numbers:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe need $F_{n+1}$, so we need to compute $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n$.\nLet $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThen $M^n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_n \\\\ F_n & F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSo the top-left element of $M^n$ is $F_{n+1}$.\n\nThe modulus is $998244353$.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Define matrix multiplication function for $2 \\times 2$ matrices modulo $MOD$.\n2. Define matrix exponentiation function using binary exponentiation (square and multiply).\n3. Compute $M^n \\pmod{MOD}$. Let $M^n = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$. Then $F_{n+1} = a$.\n4. Compute $pow(2, n, MOD)$ to get $2^n \\pmod{MOD}$.\n5. Compute $(2^n)^{-1} \\pmod{MOD}$ using modular inverse $pow(2^n, MOD-2, MOD)$.\n6. The result is $(F_{n+1} \\cdot (2^n)^{-1}) \\pmod{MOD}$.\n\nEdge case $n=1$:\n$M^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. $F_{1+1}=F_2=1$.\n$2^1=2$. $(2)^{-1} = 499122177$.\n$1 \\cdot 499122177 = 499122177$.\nThis is different from example $n=1$ output $748683265$.\nThe example output $748683265$ is $1/2$.\nAh, the example output is `748683265` for $n=1$ AND $n=2$ AND $n=3$.\nThis implies $1/2$ is the answer for $n=1,2,3$.\nMy calculation:\n$n=1: F_2/2^1 = 1/2$. Matches $1/2$.\n$n=2: F_3/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$. Matches $1/2$.\n$n=3: F_4/2^3 = 3/8$. This does NOT match $1/2$. It should be $374341632$.\n\nThe problem note says:\n\"The real answer for the first example is $1/4$: with probability $1/4$, the towers are built in both towns $1$ and $2$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$.\"\nThis note refers to $n=2$.\nIf $n=2$, the answer is $1/4$. My calculation $F_3/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$.\nThe example output for $n=2$ is $748683265$, which is $1/2$.\nThe note for $n=2$ says $1/4$.\nThe example output for $n=1$ is $748683265$, which is $1/2$.\nThe example output for $n=3$ is $748683265$, which is $1/2$.\nThe note for $n=3$ says $1/4$. (Wait, this is for $n=3$. \"The real answer for the second example is $1/4$: with probability $1/8$, the towers are built in towns $1$, $2$ and $3$, so we can set their signal powers to $1$; with probability $1/8$, only one tower in town $2$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $2$.\" This is $1/8+1/8=2/8=1/4$.)\n\nIt seems the example output is inconsistent with the example notes, and both are inconsistent with my derivation of $F_{n+1}/2^n$.\nThe problem statement itself is:\n\"Input: ['2', '3', '5', '200000']\"\n\"Output: ['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\"\nThis means:\n$n=2 \\implies 748683265 (1/2)$\n$n=3 \\implies 748683265 (1/2)$\n$n=5 \\implies 842268673 (5/32)$\n$n=200000 \\implies 202370013$\n\nMy $F_{n+1}/2^n$ produces:\n$n=2: F_3/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2$. Matches output.\n$n=3: F_4/2^3 = 3/8$. Does NOT match output $1/2$.\n$n=5: F_6/2^5 = 8/32 = 1/4$. Does NOT match output $5/32$.\n\nMy derivation of $N_{valid}=F_{n+1}$ appears correct and matches the problem note for $n=2$ (1 valid set $S=\\{1,2\\}$) and $n=3$ (2 valid sets $S=\\{1,2,3\\}$ or $S=\\{2\\}$).\nThe problem note for $n=2$ says $1/4$. My formula gives $1/2$.\nThe problem note for $n=3$ says $1/4$. My formula gives $3/8$.\nThe problem note for $n=5$ says $5/32$. My formula gives $8/32 = 1/4$.\n\nIt seems the problem notes are consistent with each other, and the example output is inconsistent with the notes.\nLet's trust the notes.\n$n=2$: $N_{valid}=1$. Prob $1/4$.\n$n=3$: $N_{valid}=2$. Prob $2/8 = 1/4$.\n$n=5$: $N_{valid}=5$. Prob $5/32$.\n\nThis is $F_{n-1}/2^n$ if we use $F_0=0, F_1=1$.\nLet's check $F_{n-1}/2^n$.\n$n=2: F_1/2^2 = 1/4$. Matches note.\n$n=3: F_2/2^3 = 1/8$. Does NOT match note $1/4$.\n$n=5: F_4/2^5 = 3/32$. Does NOT match note $5/32$.\n\nMy $N_{valid}$ values are:\n$n=1: 1$\n$n=2: 1$\n$n=3: 2$\n$n=4: 3$\n$n=5: 5$\nThis is sequence $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots$. This is $F_k$ where $F_1=1, F_2=1$.\nSo $N_{valid} = F_n$.\nLet's try $F_n/2^n$.\n$n=1: F_1/2^1 = 1/2$. (Note N/A, Output $1/2$)\n$n=2: F_2/2^2 = 1/4$. (Note $1/4$, Output $1/2$)\n$n=3: F_3/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. (Note $1/4$, Output $1/2$)\n$n=5: F_5/2^5 = 5/32$. (Note $5/32$, Output $5/32$)\n\nThis matches the notes and the output for $n=5$.\nIt also matches the output for $n=1,2,3$ if the output is $1/2$ for $n=1,2,3$.\nBut the problem notes for $n=2,3$ explicitly state $1/4$.\nThis is very confusing.\n\"The real answer for the first example is $1/4$:\" (referring to $n=2$)\n\"The real answer for the second example is $1/4$:\" (referring to $n=3$)\n\"The real answer for the third example is $5/32$.\" (referring to $n=5$)\n\nSo, the notes are:\n$n=2 \\implies 1/4$\n$n=3 \\implies 1/4$\n$n=5 \\implies 5/32$\n\nMy formula $F_n/2^n$ (where $F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, \\dots$):\n$n=2: F_2/2^2 = 1/4$. Matches note.\n$n=3: F_3/2^3 = 2/8 = 1/4$. Matches note.\n$n=5: F_5/2^5 = 5/32$. Matches note.\n\nSo the formula $F_n/2^n$ (with $F_1=1, F_2=1$) is consistent with all the problem notes.\nThe example output values must be wrong for $n=1,2,3$.\nThe problem description says \"Input: ['2', '3', '5', '200000']\". This means the inputs are $2, 3, 5, 200000$.\nThe outputs are $748683265, 748683265, 842268673, 202370013$.\nSo for $n=2$, output is $748683265 = 1/2$. Note says $1/4$.\nFor $n=3$, output is $748683265 = 1/2$. Note says $1/4$.\nFor $n=5$, output is $842268673 = 5/32$. Note says $5/32$.\n\nGiven the inconsistency, I should trust my derivation and the problem notes.\nThe formula is $F_n / 2^n$, where $F_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number with $F_1=1, F_2=1$.\nUsing $F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, \\dots$ this means $F_n$.\nFor matrix exponentiation, this means we need $F_n$, so we compute $M^{n-1}$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n$M^{n-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} F_n & F_{n-1} \\\\ F_{n-1} & F_{n-2} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe top-left element $F_n$ is what we need.\nIf $n=1$, $M^0 = I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. $F_1=1$. This works.\n\nFinal check on $F_n$ definition and $M^k$:\nIf $F_0=0, F_1=1$, then $\\begin{pmatrix} F_{k+1} \\\\ F_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTo get $F_n$, we need to compute $M^{n-1}$ and take $F_n$ from $\\begin{pmatrix} F_n \\\\ F_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} = M^{n-1} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe top element of the resulting vector is $F_n$.\nSo we need $M^{n-1}$. Let $A = M^{n-1}$. Then $F_n = A_{00}$.\nExample $n=1$: $M^0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. $F_1=1$. Correct.\nExample $n=2$: $M^1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. $F_2=1$. Correct.\nExample $n=3$: $M^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. $F_3=2$. Correct.\nSo the value to use is $F_n$ computed from $M^{n-1}$.\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n\n    MOD = 998244353\n\n    # Base cases for Fibonacci\n    # F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, ...\n    # We need F_n.\n    # For n=1, F_1=1.
