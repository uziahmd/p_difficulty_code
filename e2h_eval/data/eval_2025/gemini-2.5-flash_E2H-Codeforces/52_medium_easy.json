Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"New Year Candles.\" Vasily starts with 'a' candles, each burning for an hour.  He can combine 'b' burnt-out candles to make a new one. The goal is to maximize the total burn time.\n\nThe input's pretty straightforward: 'a' and 'b'. The output is the maximum total hours the room can be lit.  There's an example: if a=4, b=2, the total is 7 hours.  Seems about right, given how that example traces through.\n\nMy approach? A simulation.  I'll use a `while` loop that keeps going as long as there are candles to burn. I'll need these variables: `total_hours` (the answer I'm after), `current_new_candles` (the number Vasily currently has) and `burnt_out_candles` (the burnt ones accumulating).\n\nHere's the plan.  In the loop: First, I burn all the `current_new_candles`.  Add that to the `total_hours`.  Also, I add that number to the `burnt_out_candles` because those candles are now out. Next, I check if there are enough burnt ones to make new candles. If so, I calculate `new_candles_from_burnt` (integer division). Add those to `current_new_candles`, and update `burnt_out_candles` with the remainder.\n\nI’m thinking, let's test it with the example. If a=4, b=2. Initially, zero hours, four candles, no burnt ones. Loop 1: 4 hours, 4 burnt, zero new. Create 2 new, 0 burnt. Loop 2: 2 hours, 2 burnt, zero new. Create 1 new, 0 burnt. Loop 3: 1 hour, 1 burnt. No new ones because b=2. Total hours? 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Matches!  Alright, let's try a=6, b=3. Should get 8. I can see how it works. Okay, 6 hours, 6 burnt.  6 // 3 = 2 new candles. 0 remaining burnt ones. Next round, 2 hours, 2 burnt.  2 // 3 is 0, so the loop stops at a total of 6 + 2 = 8 hours.  Good!\n\nThe constraints are `1 <= a <= 1000` and `2 <= b <= 1000`. So, the number of iterations should be reasonable, even in the worst case where a and b are 1000 and 2. The hours are not expected to be huge so overflow or performance shouldn't be a problem. The important variables here are all simple integer values, so there won't be any rounding errors.\n\nFor implementation, I'll read a and b from input, probably `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)` to parse them.  I'll use a while loop as planned, update the variables and print the final `total_hours`.\n\nOh, edge cases. Let's see. If a is 1 and b is 2. Then, 1 hour, 1 burnt. No new ones. Total is 1, makes sense. And if a=b, then after one round, the number of candles stays the same. The maximum cases are when a = 1, in which case the answer is one, or when the number of new candles decreases rapidly. Also tried the case of a = 1000, b= 1000, that resulted in 1001. That's the correct edge case.\n\nI'm confident this'll work.  Let's code it!\n\n(Here comes the Python code) ...\n\nI'll write the code so that it can handle the usual setup for competitive programming which is multiple input lines. Let me set up that `main()` function. One line after the other, read them, parse them, and run the calculation.\n\nI hope this'll work in the judge system. It should. I've covered the cases.  Let's submit!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate the total number of hours Vasily can light up his room given an initial number of new candles (`a`) and the number of burnt-out candles (`b`) required to craft a new one. Each candle burns for one hour.\n\nWe can simulate this process step by step:\n\n1.  **Initialize:**\n    *   `total_hours`: Stores the cumulative hours the room is lit. Initially 0.\n    *   `current_new_candles`: The number of unburned candles Vasily currently has. Initially `a`.\n    *   `burnt_out_candles`: The number of candles that have burned out. Initially 0.\n\n2.  **Simulation Loop:** Continue as long as Vasily has `current_new_candles` to burn.\n    *   **Burn Candles:** All `current_new_candles` are lit.\n        *   Add `current_new_candles` to `total_hours` (each burns for 1 hour).\n        *   Add `current_new_candles` to `burnt_out_candles` (they are now used up).\n        *   Set `current_new_candles` to 0, as they have all been burned.\n    *   **Craft New Candles:** Use the `burnt_out_candles` to make new ones.\n        *   Calculate how many new candles can be made: `new_candles_from_burnt = burnt_out_candles // b` (integer division).\n        *   Add `new_candles_from_burnt` to `current_new_candles`.\n        *   Update `burnt_out_candles` to `burnt_out_candles % b` (the remainder that couldn't form a new candle).\n\n3.  **Result:** Once the loop finishes (i.e., `current_new_candles` becomes 0 and no more can be crafted), `total_hours` will hold the final answer.\n\nThis simulation correctly accounts for all candles burned, including those initially available and those crafted from burnt-out ones. The loop is guaranteed to terminate because in each crafting step, `b` burnt-out candles are consumed to produce 1 new candle, effectively reducing the total \"candle material\" (considering `b` burnt-out candles as equivalent to 1 new candle).\n\nThe input format described (\"The single line contains two integers, a and b\") combined with the example format (`['4 2', '6 3']`, `['7', '8']`) suggests that the problem might be tested with multiple test cases, each on a new line, until the end of the input stream (EOF). The provided solution handles this by iterating over `sys.stdin`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read lines from standard input until EOF\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        # Strip leading/trailing whitespace (like newline characters) from the line\n        line = line.strip()\n        \n        # If the line is empty after stripping, skip it (e.g., blank lines or EOF)\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        \n        # Parse the two integers from the line\n        a, b = map(int, line.split())\n        \n        # Initialize variables for the simulation\n        total_hours = 0\n        current_new_candles = a\n        burnt_out_candles = 0\n        \n        # Simulate the candle burning and crafting process\n        # The loop continues as long as there are new candles available to burn\n        while current_new_candles > 0:\n            # 1.
