Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Knapsack Problem with a Twist: Souvenir Selection**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem staring me in the face, and it's a classic knapsack scenario, but with a clever constraint that opens up a more efficient solution. The problem gives me `n` souvenirs, each with a weight (`w_i`) and a cost (`c_i`). My goal is to maximize the total cost of the souvenirs I pick, without exceeding a total weight limit `m`. The catch? `w_i` is annoyingly small, only ranging from 1 to 3.\n\nMy initial thought was the standard dynamic programming approach, where I'd have a `dp[w]` array to track the maximum cost for each weight `w`. But with `m` up to 300000, that `O(n*m)` complexity would be a disaster. It would be `O(3*10^10)`.\n\nThat's when the small weight constraint hit me. Weights of 1, 2, and 3 - this simplifies things significantly! I can categorize the souvenirs by their weight: `items_w1`, `items_w2`, and `items_w3`. To maximize the cost, I'll sort each of these lists in descending order of cost. Now, I need to figure out how many items to take from each category. Let's call them `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`. The total weight constraint becomes `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 + k3 * 3 <= m`. The goal is to maximize the sum of costs: `sum(items_w1[:k1]) + sum(items_w2[:k2]) + sum(items_w3[:k3])`.\n\nBut wait, even with this grouping, just iterating through all combinations of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` won't work due to the constraints. With `m` up to 300000 and potentially picking all `n = 100000` items, I'm thinking about an approach based on iterating the selection from the heaviest items down. I need to cleverly combine items of different weights. Perhaps I can choose the number of items for `k3`, calculate the available weight, and then optimize for `k1` and `k2`. Time to experiment with this approach!\n",
