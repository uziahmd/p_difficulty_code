Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts & Problem Breakdown:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Array Stabilization\" problem. It's about minimizing \"instability\" in an array. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values. I've got to remove *exactly* one element from the array to achieve this minimum instability. The input size can be large (up to 10^5 elements), so the solution needs to be efficient.\n\n**Understanding the Constraints and Examples:**\n\nThe constraints are pretty standard: the array size is between 2 and 10^5, and the elements themselves are between 1 and 10^5. That's good; it sets the bounds. The examples help me visualize the problem. I need to be careful with edge cases, like arrays with duplicate elements. It's clear that brute-forcing won't cut it, as that would be O(N^2).\n\n**Key Insight: Sorting is Crucial:**\n\nI've realized the core insight: sorting the array is key. When I sort it, the minimum and maximum values will be at the beginning and end, respectively. Removing an element will then shift the min and max, so the minimum instability will involve the smallest and the second smallest, the largest and the second largest, or (as a base case) the smallest and the largest. I'm thinking of sorting the array as `a_sorted = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_n]`. The problem then simplifies, and I see three primary cases when I remove one element.\n\n**Case Analysis and Simplification:**\n\n*   If I remove the smallest element (`s_1`), the new minimum is `s_2` and the new maximum is `s_n`. Instability is `s_n - s_2`.\n*   If I remove the largest element (`s_n`), the new minimum is `s_1` and the new maximum is `s_{n-1}`. Instability is `s_{n-1} - s_1`.\n*   If I remove any \"middle\" element, the range remains essentially the same as the original array, which isn't optimal.\n\nAfter analyzing, I realize the best approach involves comparing the instabilities from removing the smallest and the largest elements, which boils down to `min(s_n - s_2, s_{n-1} - s_1)`. And I can be certain that any other scenarios will produce no better results.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Python Implementation:**\n\nThis leads to a simple algorithm: sort the array, calculate the two potential instabilities, and return the minimum. I'll need to use Python's sorting capabilities and efficient indexing. The constraints mean using O(N log N) is perfectly fine. I need to be careful with edge cases (like arrays of size 2, or with repeated values). Using `sys.stdin` for input is a good idea to improve efficiency.\n\n**Testing and Edge Cases:**\n\nI'll run the code on the provided examples and some extra edge cases, such as arrays with duplicates and very small values, to ensure correctness.\n\n**Complexity Analysis and Refinement:**\n\nI've run through the complexity: It will be O(N log N) dominated by the sorting step, and O(N) space.\n\n**Final Code and Submission:**\n\nI've crafted the Python code and double-checked the logic. It's concise and efficient. I'm ready to submit!\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    a.sort()\n    \n    instability1 = a[n-1] - a[1]\n    instability2 = a[n-2] - a[0]\n    \n    print(min(instability1, instability2))\n\nsolve()\n```",
