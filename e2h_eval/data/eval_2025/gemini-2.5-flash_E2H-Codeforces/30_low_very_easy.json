Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**TV Game: Algorithm Development**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"TV Game\" problem. The core of it seems straightforward: we have two players, Homer and Marge, and a number `A` with an even number of digits (`2n`). They're each taking turns, grabbing a digit from the left of `A` and building their own numbers, `S1` and `S2`. The objective is to maximize the sum of these two numbers.  The final output needs to be a string of 'H' and 'M' characters representing the move sequence.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze that example to understand what the best move sequence is. So if we have \"1234\", and the examples show \"HHMM\" is the best moves. Then for \"9911\" we have \"HMHM\" as the best, which gives a higher sum. \n\nIt's evident the key isn't just about maximizing the individual digits but how they contribute to the final sums *after* being combined to the number. Since it's about maximizing *S1 + S2*, and each digit will end up in either `S1` or `S2`, the problem boils down to intelligently distributing the digits to maximize this sum.\n\nMy next step will be to explore the digits, determine how they impact the total sum of `S1` and `S2`, and how I can utilize this to create a robust solution. I need to figure out an efficient strategy to determine this optimal distribution. It's essentially an optimization problem with a decision at each move.\n",
