On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "**A Strategy for \"A Twisty Movement\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"A Twisty Movement\" problem. The core idea is pretty straightforward: we're given an array of 1s and 2s, and we can reverse a subsegment to maximize the length of its longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS).  Since we're dealing only with 1s and 2s, the LNDS is always going to be a sequence of ones followed by a sequence of twos.  Effectively, we're trying to get as many 1s as far left as possible and as many 2s as far right as possible.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze what happens when we reverse a subsegment `[l, r]`.  The LNDS of the *modified* array is what we care about. This reversed subsegment will impact how we can arrange ones and twos to form a non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nEssentially, I need to find the best `l` and `r` to reverse. After doing so, I'll count the length of the LNDS in the new array. Let's call the original array `a` and the reversed array `b`. I'll iterate through all possible `l` and `r` values. For each subsegment, I reverse it to create `b`, and then I need a strategy to compute the LNDS efficiently.\n\nI can't just compute the LNDS of `b` directly with a standard algorithm. The optimal LNDS will be a combination of prefixes (left of the segment), the (potentially) reversed segment, and suffixes (right of the segment). So, if I pick a `k`, the LNDS might be like: Some number of 1s at the beginning (before index `k`), a series of 1s and 2s from the reversed segment (after index `k`), and then a number of 2s at the end. I can iterate over all values of `k` to find the most optimal configuration.\n\nThis is starting to feel like a dynamic programming approach, iterating over potential reversal boundaries. Let's start sketching out how the subsegment reversal impacts the overall LNDS and see if I can formulate an efficient algorithm. I'll need to keep track of the counts of 1s and 2s in different segments.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum possible length of a non-decreasing subsequence after reversing a single subsegment `a[l...r]` of the given array. The array elements are restricted to 1s and 2s.\n\n**Understanding Non-Decreasing Subsequences with 1s and 2s:**\nA non-decreasing subsequence consisting only of 1s and 2s must be of the form `1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2`. That is, all 1s must appear before all 2s in the subsequence. The length of such a subsequence is simply the count of 1s plus the count of 2s chosen.\n\n**Strategy:**\nTo maximize the length of such a subsequence, we want to pick as many 1s as possible from the initial part of the array and as many 2s as possible from the final part of the array, while ensuring that all chosen 1s appear before all chosen 2s.\n\nConsider an arbitrary split point `i` (0-indexed `i` means elements `a[0...i-1]` are considered for 1s, and `a[i...n-1]` for 2s).\nIf we don't reverse any segment, the maximum LNDS length for a given split point `i` is `(count of 1s in a[0...i-1]) + (count of 2s in a[i...n-1])`. We can iterate through all possible `i` from `0` to `n` to find the maximum.\n\nNow, let's consider reversing the segment `a[l...r]`.\nThe elements `a[0...l-1]` remain unchanged.\nThe elements `a[r+1...n-1]` remain unchanged.\nThe elements `a[l...r]` are reversed.\n\nLet's fix the interval `[l, r]` that we are reversing.\nAfter reversing, the array becomes `a_0, ..., a_{l-1}, a_r, a_{r-1}, ..., a_l, a_{r+1}, ..., a_{n-1}`.\nAn optimal non-decreasing subsequence in this new array will pick some 1s from the prefix, some 1s from the reversed middle part, some 2s from the reversed middle part, and some 2s from the suffix. The key is that all chosen 1s must come before all chosen 2s in the *modified* array.\n\nThis suggests that we can iterate through all possible `l` and `r` (there are `O(N^2)` such pairs). For each pair `(l, r)`:\n1.  Construct the new array by reversing `a[l...r]`.\n2.  Calculate the LNDS of this new array.\n\nCalculating LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s:\nFor a given array `b`, the LNDS is found by considering all possible split points `k` (0-indexed).\nFor each `k` from `0` to `n`:\n    Count 1s in `b[0...k-1]`. Let this be `count1_prefix`.\n    Count 2s in `b[k...n-1]`. Let this be `count2_suffix`.\n    The length for this split point `k` is `count1_prefix + count2_suffix`.\nThe maximum over all `k` gives the LNDS length. This takes `O(N)` for each `(l, r)` pair.\nTotal complexity: `O(N^2 * N) = O(N^3)`.\nGiven `N <= 2000`, `N^3` is `8 * 10^9`, which is too slow. `N^2` is `4 * 10^6`, which is acceptable.\n\n**Optimization to `O(N^2)`:**\nWhen we iterate through `l` and `r`, we need to efficiently calculate the LNDS.\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`, the new array has three parts:\n1.  `a[0...l-1]` (prefix, unchanged)\n2.  `a[r...l]` (middle, reversed)\n3.  `a[r+1...n-1]` (suffix, unchanged)\n\nLet's precompute prefix sums for 1s and 2s in the original array:\n`prefix_ones[i]` = count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`\n`prefix_twos[i]` = count of 2s in `a[0...i-1]`\n\nThen, `ones_in_segment(i, j)` = `prefix_ones[j+1] - prefix_ones[i]`\nAnd `twos_in_segment(i, j)` = `prefix_twos[j+1] - prefix_twos[i]`\n\nFor a chosen `l` and `r`, and a split point `k` (0-indexed):\n*   **Case 1: `k <= l`** (split point is before or at `l`)\n    *   1s are taken from `a[0...k-1]`. Count = `prefix_ones[k]`.\n    *   2s are taken from `a[k...l-1]` (if `k < l`), then `a[r...l]` (reversed middle part), then `a[r+1...n-1]` (suffix).\n    *   Count of 2s = `twos_in_segment(k, l-1)` + `ones_in_segment(l, r)` (these are 2s from original `a[l...r]` that become 1s in reversed segment) + `twos_in_segment(r+1, n-1)`.\n    *   Wait, this is incorrect. The count of 2s in the reversed middle part `a[r...l]` (which was `a[l...r]` originally) is `twos_in_segment(l, r)`.\n    *   So, if `k <= l`: `prefix_ones[k]` (1s from `a[0...k-1]`) + `twos_in_segment(k, l-1)` (2s from `a[k...l-1]`) + `twos_in_segment(l, r)` (2s from reversed `a[l...r]`) + `twos_in_segment(r+1, n-1)` (2s from `a[r+1...n-1]`).\n\n*   **Case 2: `l < k <= r+1`** (split point is within the reversed middle part or just after it)\n    *   1s are taken from `a[0...l-1]`, then `a[r...k-1]` (part of reversed middle).\n    *   Count of 1s = `prefix_ones[l]` + `ones_in_segment(l, k-1)` (these are 1s from original `a[l...k-1]` that are now at `a[r-(k-1-l)...r]`). No, this is wrong.\n    *   When the segment `a[l...r]` is reversed, `a[l]` goes to index `r`, `a[l+1]` to `r-1`, ..., `a[r]` to `l`.\n    *   So, `a[i]` (original index) moves to `l + (r-i)` (new index).\n    *   The 1s in the prefix `a[0...l-1]` are `prefix_ones[l]`.\n    *   The 2s in the suffix `a[r+1...n-1]` are `twos_in_segment(r+1, n-1)`.\n    *   The crucial part is how to count 1s and 2s in the reversed segment `a[l...r]`.\n    *   Let's denote `count_ones_before_l = prefix_ones[l]`.\n    *   Let's denote `count_twos_after_r = twos_in_segment(r+1, n-1)`.\n\n    For any split point `k` (0-indexed) in the *modified* array `b`:\n    `total_ones_up_to_k_minus_1_in_b` + `total_twos_from_k_in_b`\n\n    We can calculate `total_ones_up_to_k_minus_1_in_b` and `total_twos_from_k_in_b` by iterating `k` from `0` to `n`.\n    `current_ones_count = 0`\n    `current_twos_count = total_twos_in_array`\n    `max_lnds = 0`\n\n    For `k` from `0` to `n`:\n        `max_lnds = max(max_lnds, current_ones_count + current_twos_count)`\n        If `k < n`:\n            If `b[k]` is 1, `current_ones_count++`.\n            If `b[k]` is 2, `current_twos_count--`.\n\n    This means for each `(l, r)` pair, we construct the array `b` and then iterate `k` in `O(N)`. This is `O(N^3)`.\n\n    To optimize:\n    The LNDS length for a chosen `(l, r)` and split point `k` is:\n    `prefix_ones[l]` (1s before `l`)\n    `+ ones_in_reversed_middle_up_to_k` (1s in `b[l...k-1]` if `l <= k-1 <= r`)\n    `+ twos_in_reversed_middle_from_k` (2s in `b[k...r]` if `l <= k <= r`)\n    `+ twos_in_segment(r+1, n-1)` (2s after `r`)\n\n    Let's precompute `prefix_ones[i]` and `suffix_twos[i]` (count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`).\n    `suffix_twos[i] = prefix_twos[n] - prefix_twos[i]`.\n\n    For each `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n        For each `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n            `current_max_lnds = 0`\n            `ones_before_l = prefix_ones[l]`\n            `twos_after_r = suffix_twos[r+1]`\n\n            `ones_in_reversed_middle_so_far = 0`\n            `twos_in_reversed_middle_remaining = twos_in_segment(l, r)`\n\n            `current_max_lnds = max(current_max_lnds, ones_before_l + twos_in_segment(l, r) + twos_after_r)` (this is for split point `k=l`)\n\n            For `k_idx` from `l` to `r`: (this `k_idx` is the original index of the element that is currently at `b[k_idx]` *after* reversing.

The logic seems correct for `O(N^3)`.\n\nThe `O(N^2)` optimization requires a different approach.\nFor each `l, r`, we are essentially calculating `max_k (P1_b[k] + S2_b[k])`.\nWhere `P1_b[k]` is the count of 1s in `b[0...k-1]` and `S2_b[k]` is the count of 2s in `b[k...n-1]`.\n`S2_b[k] = (total 2s in b) - (P2_b[k])`.\nSo we want to maximize `P1_b[k] - P2_b[k] + (total 2s in b)`.\nSince `total 2s in b` is constant for fixed `l,r`, we need to maximize `P1_b[k] - P2_b[k]`.\n\nLet `val_b[k] = P1_b[k] - P2_b[k]`.\nWe can calculate `val_b[k]` for `k=0...n` in `O(N)` for each `(l,r)`.\nThis is still `O(N^3)`.\n\nThe key to `O(N^2)` must be that as `r` changes (for a fixed `l`), or `l` changes (for a fixed `r`), the `P1_b[k]` and `P2_b[k]` values can be updated quickly.\n\nLet's fix `l`. Iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\nWhen `r` increments to `r+1`:\nThe segment `a[l...r]` becomes `a[l...r+1]`.\nThe element `a[r+1]` is now part of the reversed segment.\nThe elements `a[r], ..., a[l]` shift positions.\nThis changes `b` significantly.\n\nConsider the contribution of each element to the LNDS.\nAn element `a_j` can be a `1` in the prefix or a `2` in the suffix.\nThe LNDS length is `(count of 1s in left part) + (count of 2s in right part)`.\nThe left part is `b[0...k-1]` and the right part is `b[k...n-1]`.\n\nLet `count_ones_prefix[i]` be the number of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\nLet `count_twos_suffix[i]` be the number of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\n\nThe maximum LNDS length without any reversal is `max_{i=0...n} (count_ones_prefix[i] + count_twos_suffix[i])`.\nThis is `O(N)`.\n\nNow, consider reversing `a[l...r]`.\nThe LNDS will be formed by:\n`1`s from `a[0...l-1]`\n`1`s from the reversed `a[l...r]` segment\n`2`s from the reversed `a[l...r]` segment\n`2`s from `a[r+1...n-1]`\n\nCrucially, all chosen 1s must come before all chosen 2s.\nThis means there is an implicit split point `k`.\n1s are picked from `a[0...l-1]`, then from `b[l...k_mid-1]` (where `b` is the reversed segment), then 2s from `b[k_mid...r]`, then 2s from `a[r+1...n-1]`.\n\nLet's iterate over `l` from `0` to `n-1`.\nFor each `l`, we iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\n`current_max = 0`\n`ones_before_l = count_ones_prefix[l]`\n`twos_after_r = count_twos_suffix[r+1]`\n\nThe \"middle part\" is `a[l...r]`. When reversed, 1s become 2s and 2s become 1s in terms of their position relative to each other within the segment.\nFor example, if `a[l...r]` is `[2, 1, 2]`, reversed it's `[2, 1, 2]`.\nIf `a[l...r]` is `[1, 2, 1]`, reversed it's `[1, 2, 1]`.\n\nThe problem is that the *position* of 1s and 2s change.\n`a[l]` moves to `b[r]`. `a[r]` moves to `b[l]`.\n\nLet's try to calculate `f(i, j)` = max `(count of 1s in b[i...k-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k...j])` for `i <= k <= j+1`.\nThis is the LNDS for just the segment `b[i...j]`.\nFor a fixed `l, r`:\n`max_lnds = 0`\n`total_ones_in_middle = 0`\n`total_twos_in_middle = 0`\nFor `k_mid` from `l` to `r+1`:\n    `ones_in_middle_prefix = 0`\n    `twos_in_middle_suffix = 0`\n\n    // Calculate 1s in `b[l...k_mid-1]`\n    For `idx` from `l` to `k_mid-1`:\n        `original_idx = r - (idx - l)`\n        If `a[original_idx] == 1`: `ones_in_middle_prefix++`\n    \n    // Calculate 2s in `b[k_mid...r]`\n    For `idx` from `k_mid` to `r`:\n        `original_idx = r - (idx - l)`\n        If `a[original_idx] == 2`: `twos_in_middle_suffix++`\n\n    `max_lnds = max(max_lnds, ones_before_l + ones_in_middle_prefix + twos_in_middle_suffix + twos_after_r)`\n\nThis is `O(N)` inside the `(l,r)` loop, making it `O(N^3)`.\nTo make it `O(N^2)`, we need to calculate `ones_in_middle_prefix` and `twos_in_middle_suffix` in `O(1)` or `O(log N)` when `k_mid` changes.\n\nWhen `k_mid` increments by 1:\n`ones_in_middle_prefix` potentially increases if `b[k_mid-1]` was 1.\n`twos_in_middle_suffix` potentially decreases if `b[k_mid-1]` was 2.\n\nLet `current_ones_in_middle_prefix = 0`\nLet `current_twos_in_middle_suffix = total_twos_in_original_a[l...r]`\n`max_val_for_middle = current_ones_in_middle_prefix + current_twos_in_middle_suffix` (for `k_mid=l`)\n\nFor `k_mid` from `l+1` to `r+1`:\n    `val_at_k_mid_minus_1_in_b = a[r - ((k_mid-1) - l)]`\n    If `val_at_k_mid_minus_1_in_b == 1`:\n        `current_ones_in_middle_prefix++`\n    Else (`val_at_k_mid_minus_1_in_b == 2`):\n        `current_twos_in_middle_suffix--`\n    `max_val_for_middle = max(max_val_for_middle, current_ones_in_middle_prefix + current_twos_in_middle_suffix)`\n\nThis inner loop for `k_mid` is `O(N)`. So, `O(N^3)`.\n\nThe `O(N^2)` solution is tricky.\nLet `dp[i]` be the maximum LNDS ending at index `i`. This is not applicable here because of the single reversal.\n\nLet's rethink the structure of the LNDS.\nIt is `(prefix of 1s) + (middle of 1s) + (middle of 2s) + (suffix of 2s)`.\nThe `prefix of 1s` comes from `a[0...l-1]`.\nThe `suffix of 2s` comes from `a[r+1...n-1]`.\nThe `middle of 1s` and `middle of 2s` come from the reversed `a[l...r]`.\n\nLet `P1[i]` be the count of 1s in `a[0...i-1]`.\nLet `S2[i]` be the count of 2s in `a[i...n-1]`.\n\nFor a fixed `l` and `r`:\nThe contribution from `a[0...l-1]` is `P1[l]`.\nThe contribution from `a[r+1...n-1]` is `S2[r+1]`.\nThe remaining part `a[l...r]` is reversed. Let this reversed segment be `mid_b`.\nWe need to find the LNDS of `mid_b`. Let this be `LNDS_mid(l, r)`.\nThen the total LNDS is `P1[l] + LNDS_mid(l, r) + S2[r+1]`.\n\nHow to calculate `LNDS_mid(l, r)` efficiently?\n`LNDS_mid(l, r) = max_{k_mid=l...r+1} ( (count of 1s in b[l...k_mid-1]) + (count of 2s in b[k_mid...r]) )`.\nLet `cnt1_mid_prefix[k_mid]` be count of 1s in `b[l...k_mid-1]`.\nLet `cnt2_mid_suffix[k_mid]` be count of 2s in `b[k_mid...r]`.\nWe need `max_{k_mid} (cnt1_mid_prefix[k_mid] + cnt2_mid_suffix[k_mid])`.\n\nFor a fixed `l`:\nIterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\nWhen `r` increases to `r+1`:\nThe segment `a[l...r]` becomes `a[l...r+1]`.\nThe `mid_b` changes.\nThis is still hard.\n\nLet's try a different perspective.\nThe final array `b` will have some 1s and some 2s.\nThe LNDS will be `k_1` ones followed by `k_2` twos.\nTotal length `k_1 + k_2`.\nThe `k_1` ones must come from indices `p_1 < ... < p_{k_1}`.\nThe `k_2` twos must come from indices `q_1 < ... < q_{k_2}`.\nAnd `p_{k_1} < q_1`.\n\nThis means there's some index `i` such that all 1s are picked from `b[0...i-1]` and all 2s are picked from `b[i...n-1]`.\nSo, we iterate `i` from `0` to `n`. For each `i`, we want to maximize `(count of 1s in b[0...i-1]) + (count of 2s in b[i...n-1])`.\nLet this value be `V(i, l, r)`. We want `max_{l, r, i} V(i, l, r)`.\n\n`V(i, l, r) = (P1[l] if i <= l else (P1[l] + ones_in_reversed_prefix(l, r, i))) + (S2[r+1] if i > r else (S2[r+1] + twos_in_reversed_suffix(l, r, i)))`\nThis is still the `O(N^3)` approach.\n\nThe constraint `N <= 2000` usually means `O(N^2)` or `O(N^2 log N)`.\nLet's consider the structure of the `O(N^2)` solution.\nIt often involves fixing two indices `i, j` and then doing `O(1)` work.\nWhat if `i` and `j` are `l` and `r`?\n`max_{l,r} (P1[l] + S2[r+1] + LNDS_middle(l,r))`\n`LNDS_middle(l,r)` is `max_{k_mid} (count of 1s in b[l...k_mid-1] + count of 2s in b[k_mid...r])`.\n\nLet's define `f(idx, val)`:\n`f(idx, 1)` = number of 1s in `a[0...idx-1]`\n`f(idx, 2)` = number of 2s in `a[idx...n-1]`\n\n`P1[i]` = `f(i, 1)`\n`S2[i]` = `f(i, 2)`\n\nFor each `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n    For each `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n        `current_max_lnds = 0`\n        `ones_left_of_l = P1[l]`\n        `twos_right_of_r = S2[r+1]`\n\n        `ones_in_reversed_segment_prefix = 0` // 1s in b[l...k-1]\n        `twos_in_reversed_segment_suffix = 0` // 2s in b[k...r]\n\n        // Calculate initial total twos in the segment a[l...r]\n        `total_twos_in_original_segment = P2[r+1] - P2[l]`\n        `twos_in_reversed_segment_suffix = total_twos_in_original_segment`\n\n        // Split point `k` is at `l` (all 2s from middle)\n        `current_max_lnds = max(current_max_lnds, ones_left_of_l + twos_in_reversed_segment_suffix + twos_right_of_r)`\n\n        // Iterate `k` from `l+1` to `r+1` (split point moves right in the reversed segment)\n        For `k_idx` from `l` to `r`: // `k_idx` is the *new* index in `b`\n            // The element `b[k_idx]` is `a[r - (k_idx - l)]`\n            `original_value_at_b_k_idx = a[r - (k_idx - l)]`\n\n            If `original_value_at_b_k_idx == 1`:\n                `ones_in_reversed_segment_prefix++`\n            Else (`original_value_at_b_k_idx == 2`):\n                `twos_in_reversed_segment_suffix--`\n            \n            `current_max_lnds = max(current_max_lnds, ones_left_of_l + ones_in_reversed_segment_prefix + twos_in_reversed_segment_suffix + twos_right_of_r)`\n        \n        `overall_max_lnds = max(overall_max_lnds, current_max_lnds)`\n\nThis is the `O(N^3)` solution described earlier, but written more clearly.\nThe `N=2000` constraint strongly suggests that the `k_idx` loop must be eliminated or optimized to `O(1)`.\n\nLet's look at the `k_idx` loop:\n`ones_in_reversed_segment_prefix` is `count(1s in b[l...k_idx])`\n`twos_in_reversed_segment_suffix` is `count(2s in b[k_idx+1...r])`\n\nThe value `ones_left_of_l + ones_in_reversed_segment_prefix + twos_in_reversed_segment_suffix + twos_right_of_r`\ncan be rewritten as:\n`P1[l] + (count of 1s in a[r - (k_idx - l) ... r]) + (count of 2s in a[l ... r - (k_idx + 1 - l)]) + S2[r+1]`\nThis is still `O(N^3)`.\n\nWhat if we fix the split point `k` first?\n`ans = max_k (max_{l,r} (P1_b[k] + S2_b[k]))`\nThis means we iterate `k` from `0` to `n`.\nFor each `k`, we want to find `l, r` that maximizes `P1_b[k] + S2_b[k]`.\n\n`P1_b[k]` is the count of 1s in `b[0...k-1]`.\n`S2_b[k]` is the count of 2s in `b[k...n-1]`.\n\nCase 1: `k <= l`\n    `P1_b[k] = P1[k]`\n    `S2_b[k] = S2[k]`\n    This is just the LNDS without reversal.\n    `ans = max(ans, P1[k] + S2[k])` for all `k`.\n\nCase 2: `k > r`\n    `P1_b[k] = P1[k]`\n    `S2_b[k] = S2[k]`\n    This is also just the LNDS without reversal.\n\nCase 3: `l < k <= r` (split point `k` is within the *original* segment `a[l...r]`)\n    No, this is `l < k <= r` (split point `k` is within the *modified* segment `b[l...r]`).\n    `P1_b[k] = P1[l] + (count of 1s in b[l...k-1])`\n    `S2_b[k] = S2[r+1] + (count of 2s in b[k...r])`\n    The `(count of 1s in b[l...k-1])` comes from `a[r-(k-1-l) ... r]`.\n    The `(count of 2s in b[k...r])` comes from `a[l ... r-(k-l)]`.\n\n    So, `P1_b[k] + S2_b[k] = P1[l] + S2[r+1] + (count of 1s in a[r-(k-1-l) ... r]) + (count of 2s in a[l ... r-(k-l)])`.\n\nThis is the `O(N^3)` solution.

No such constraint.\n\nWhat if we consider the effect of reversing the segment `a[l...r]`?\nIt changes the count of 1s and 2s that can be picked from that segment.\nSpecifically, for any `j` such that `l <= j <= r`:\nIf `a[j] == 1`, it becomes `2` if chosen as a `2` from the reversed segment.\nIf `a[j] == 2`, it becomes `1` if chosen as a `1` from the reversed segment.\n\nThis is not right.

Then `k = x+l`.\n`k-1 = x+l-1`.\n`r-(k-1-l) = r-(x-1)`.\n`r-(k-l) = r-x`.\n\nWe need to maximize `P1[l] - P2[l] + S2[r+1] + P1[r+1] - P1[r-x+1] + P2[r-x+1]` for `0 < x <= r-l+1`.\nLet `val[j] = P2[j] - P1[j]`.\nThen we need to maximize `P1[l] - P2[l] + S2[r+1] + P1[r+1] - (P1[r-x+1] - P2[r-x+1])`.\n`max_{l,r} ( P1[l] - P2[l] + S2[r+1] + P1[r+1] + max_{x} (-P1[r-x+1] + P2[r-x+1]) )`.\n`max_{l,r} ( P1[l] - P2[l] + S2[r+1] + P1[r+1] + max_{x} (val[r-x+1]) )`.\nLet `j_idx = r-x+1`. As `x` goes from `1` to `r-l+1`, `j_idx` goes from `r` down to `l`.\nSo we need `max_{l,r} ( P1[l] - P2[l] + S2[r+1] + P1[r+1] + max_{j_idx=l...r} (val[j_idx]) )`.\n\nThis is `O(N^2)`!\nFor each `l` from `0` to `n-1`:\n    `max_val_in_middle = -infinity`\n    For each `r` from `l` to `n-1`:\n        `j_idx = r`\n        `max_val_in_middle = max(max_val_in_middle, P2[j_idx] -

P1[j_idx])`.\nThis is `max_{j_idx=l...r} (count of 2s in a[0...j_idx-1] - count of 1s in a[0...j_idx-1])`.\nThis is exactly `max_{j_idx=l...r} ( (count of 2s in a[l...j_idx-1]) - (count of 1s in a[l...j_idx-1]) )`\nplus `(P2[l] - P1[l])`.\n\nSo the formula:\n`P1[l] + S2[r+1] + P1[r+1] - P1[j_prime] + P2[i_prime+1]`\nwhere `j_prime = r-(k-1-l)` and `i_prime = r-(k-l)`.\nThis corresponds to `P1[l]` (1s before `l`) + `S2[r+1]` (2s after `r`)\n+ `(P1[r+1] -

P1[r-(k-1-l)]) + (P2[r-(k-l)+1] - P2[l]))`.\nLet `x = k-l`. `x` goes from `0` to `r-l`.\nThe split point `k` in `b` is from `l` to `r+1`.\n`k_mid_idx` in my `O(N^3)` loop goes from `l` to `r`.\n`k_mid_idx = l` corresponds to `x=0`. `k_mid_idx = r` corresponds to `x=r-l`.\nThe split point is `k_mid_idx`.\n`P1[l] + S2[r+1]` are constants for fixed `l,r`.\nWe need to maximize `(P1[r+1] - P1[r-(k_mid_idx-l)]) + (P2[r-(k_mid_idx-l)+1] - P2[l])`.\nLet `idx_orig_end_1s = r-(k_mid_idx-l)`.\nLet `idx_orig_start_2s = r-(k_mid_idx-l)`.\nThis `idx_orig_end_1s` is the original index of the rightmost element that contributes a `1` to the `1`s-part of the reversed segment.\n`idx_orig_start_2s` is the original index of the leftmost element that contributes a `2` to the `2`s-part of the reversed segment.\nThese are the same.\nSo `max_k ( (P1[r+1] - P1[idx_orig_end_1s]) + (P2[idx_orig_start_2s+1] - P2[l]) )`.\nLet `j = idx_orig_end_1s`.\n`j` ranges from `l` to `r`.\n`j = r-(k_mid_idx-l)`.\nWhen `k_mid_idx=l`, `j=r`.\nWhen `k_mid_idx=r`, `j=l`.\nSo `j` goes from `r` down to `l`.\n\nWe need to maximize `(P1[r+1] - P1[j]) + (P2[j+1] - P2[l])` over `j` from `l` to `r`.\nThis is `P1[r+1] - P1[j] + P2[j+1] - P2[l]`.\n`P1[r+1] - P2[l]` are constants for fixed `l, r`.\nWe need to maximize `P2[j+1] - P1[j]` over `j` from `l` to `r`.\nLet `val_j = P2[j+1] - P1[j]`.\nSo, for fixed `l, r`, the middle part contributes `P1[r+1] - P2[l] + max_{j=l...r} (P2[j+1] - P1[j])`.\n\nTotal `LNDS = P1[l] + S2[r+1] + P1[r+1] - P2[l] + max_{j=l...r} (P2[j+1] - P1[j])`.\n`S2[r+1] = P2[n] - P2[r+1]`.\nSo `LNDS = P1[l] - P2[l] + P2[n] - P2[r+1] + P1[r+1] + max_{j=l...r} (P2[j+1] - P1[j])`.\n`LNDS = (P1[l] - P2[l]) + (P1[r+1] - P2[r+1]) + P2[n] + max_{j=l...r} (P2[j+1] - P1[j])`.\n\nThis is `O(N^2)`.\nIterate `l` from `0` to `n-1`.\n  `max_val_j = -infinity`\n  Iterate `r` from `l` to `n-1`.\n    `j = r`.\n    `max_val_j = max(max_val_j, P2[r+1] -

P1[j]` is for `j` from `l` to `r`.\n`P1[j]` is count of 1s in `a[0...j-1]`.\n`P2[j+1]` is count of 2s in `a[0...j]`.\nSo `P2[j+1] - P1[j]` is `(count of 2s in a[0...j]) - (count of 1s in a[0...j-1])`.\nThis is `(count of 2s in a[l...j]) -
