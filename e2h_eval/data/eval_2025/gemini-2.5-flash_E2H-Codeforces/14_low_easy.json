He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Let's Tackle This Trailing Zero Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"A Trivial Problem\" staring me down, and it's all about finding numbers whose factorials have a specific number of trailing zeroes. The input is just the target number of zeroes, `m`, and I need to output how many numbers (`k`) have that many zeroes, and the numbers themselves.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze the core of the problem: trailing zeroes are fundamentally tied to the powers of 5 and 2 in the factorial's prime factorization.  Since there are always more factors of 2 than 5, I really only need to count the factors of 5.\n\n**Understanding the Core**\n\nThis leads me directly to Legendre's formula, which gives me a precise way to calculate the number of factors of a prime `p` in `n!`. For this problem, `p` is 5, and I can formulate the number of trailing zeroes, `Z(n)`, as a sum of floor divisions.  Thinking this through, I realize that `Z(n)` is non-decreasing. It either stays the same or increases as `n` grows.\n\n**Key Insights and Algorithm**\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting: I've realized that `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5.  Furthermore, the amount of the increase depends on the power of 5 that divides `n`. It increases by 1 for multiples of 5 (but not 25), by 2 for multiples of 25 (but not 125), and so on.\n\nThis observation is crucial! It means I can *iterate* through multiples of 5 and track the value of `Z(n)`. When I hit the target value, `m`, I have a starting point. Then, because `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, I just need to identify the range of `n` that produce exactly `m` trailing zeroes. Since `Z(n)` increases in steps, I know there will either be a range (more than one number) or no numbers with exactly `m` zeroes. I can do a binary search like manner to quickly identify the range.\n\nThe plan now is to translate this logic into Python.  I'll start with a function to calculate `Z(n)` using Legendre's formula, then build the iteration loop and search. This should be a straightforward and efficient solution. Let's get coding!\n",
