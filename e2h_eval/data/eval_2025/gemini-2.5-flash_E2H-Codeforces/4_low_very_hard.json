The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Rock-Paper-Scissors Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this Rock-Paper-Scissors scenario and immediately see the potential for some clever optimization given the constraints.  The user wants a Python script to figure out the number of losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus in a cyclical game. The critical thing here is the massive number of rounds, `n`, up to 2 billion, but the cyclical nature of their strategies. This shouts \"periodicity\" at me.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules. Standard RPS: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. Draw if they play the same. No problem there.\n\nThe input provides the number of rounds, `n`, and the cyclical sequences for each player, `A` for Nikephoros and `B` for Polycarpus.  `A` has length `m`, and `B` has length `k`, both up to 1000.  The constraint on `n` means brute-force simulation is out.  I need to use periodicity.\n\nSince both players use repeating patterns, I realize the \"state\" of the game, (Nikephoros's play, Polycarpus's play), will also cycle. The combined cycle repeats every `lcm(m, k)` rounds.  I can calculate this using the formula: `lcm(m, k) = (m * k) / gcd(m, k)`.  Crucially, the maximum value for `lcm(m, k)` is 1 million, which is manageable.\n\nHere's how I'll approach the solution:\n\n1. **Figure out who wins each round**. I need a reliable way to determine the winner (or a draw) given the plays of Nikephoros and Polycarpus.  I'll define a function, `get_winner()`.  I'll represent the rules internally, possibly using a dictionary like `rules = {'R': 'S', 'S': 'P', 'P': 'R'}`.  The logic is straightforward: compare the items played based on the `beats` relationship.\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of losses within one cycle**.  I'll compute `L = lcm(m,k)`.\n    Then, I'll simulate one full cycle. From `i = 0` to `L-1`, for each round:\n        *   Determine Nikephoros's play `A[i % m]` and Polycarpus's play `B[i % k]`.\n        *   Call `get_winner()` to determine the outcome and update the loss counts for both players, `n_losses_cycle` and `p_losses_cycle`.\n\n3. **Scale up**. After simulating a cycle, I'll calculate the total number of cycles. `total_cycles = n // L`. I need to figure out the leftover, the remaining rounds: `remainder = n % L`.  Finally, I will calculate the total losses for each player by multiplying the losses within a cycle by the number of full cycles and then adding losses within the `remainder` rounds.\n",
