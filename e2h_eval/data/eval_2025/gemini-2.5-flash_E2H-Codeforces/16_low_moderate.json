Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Crazy Town Problem**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and it's essentially a graph traversal disguised as a geometry problem.  My initial assessment is this: they give me home and university coordinates, a bunch of lines (roads) that form boundaries between blocks, and I need to figure out the shortest path, or rather, the minimum number of road crossings, to get from home to the university.\n\nI've got the inputs sorted: home coordinates `(x1, y1)`, university coordinates `(x2, y2)`, and a list of roads defined by their coefficients (`ai, bi, ci`).  The constraints seem reasonable, manageable, and nothing too tricky is jumping out.  Crucially, they've explicitly stated that neither the home nor the university will *ever* lie directly on a road, which simplifies things.\n\nThe core insight is this: each road represents a barrier, a potential \"step\" in my journey. The number of steps needed is directly related to the number of roads that actually *separate* the home and the university. It's a matter of identifying which lines effectively act as dividers.\n\nThe classic line equation, `ax + by + c = 0`, is the key. For any point, substituting the x and y values gives a result that indicates which side of the line the point is on. Positive and negative values are on opposite sides, and zero means the point is on the line (which, as we know, won't happen here). So, if I evaluate the line equation for both home and university points, and the signs of the results are *different*, then that road separates them, and that's a \"step.\"  If the signs are the same, they're on the same block, and I don't count it.\n\nMy algorithm will be straightforward. I'll read the input coordinates and the road definitions. Then, I'll iterate through each road, evaluate the line equation for both the home and university coordinates, check the signs, and increment a `steps` counter if the signs differ. The final `steps` value will be my answer. It's a simple, elegant geometric solution. This is definitely a manageable problem, and I'm confident in a clean Python implementation.\n",
