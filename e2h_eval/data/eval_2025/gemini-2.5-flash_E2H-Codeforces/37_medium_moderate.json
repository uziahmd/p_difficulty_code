    "thought": "**My primary focus here is to create a Python script that efficiently solves the \"Gluttony\" competitive programming problem. The core challenge lies in constructing an array 'b' as a permutation of a given array 'a' of distinct integers, such that the sum of elements within every non-empty, non-full subset of indices in 'a' differs from the corresponding sum in 'b'.**  I've thoroughly analyzed the problem constraints, particularly the size limit of the input array (n <= 22) and the distinct nature of the elements. My initial intuition led me to explore a shifted permutation, specifically `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]`, aiming for a simple yet effective solution.  Through a rigorous, step-by-step logical verification, I confirmed this approach. I realized the crux of the solution hinges on ensuring that the index permutation, essentially a cyclic shift, doesn't map a subset of indices back onto itself, thus avoiding equal sums. By leveraging the problem's stipulation of distinct elements in the array 'a', I was able to rigorously demonstrate the cyclic shift strategy's validity.  I methodically considered edge cases, such as `n=1`, and expanded my understanding of what a valid solution truly entails. My solution involves the simple cyclic shift b = [a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1], a[0]]. Based on the problem specifics, I'm confident that this should function as a complete solution.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` (which contains `n` distinct integers) such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S` (i.e., `0 < |S| < n`), the sum of elements at these positions in `a` is different from the sum of elements at these positions in `b`. That is, `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`.\n\nLet's consider a simple permutation: a cyclic shift.\nLet `b` be `a` shifted cyclically to the left by one position. Specifically, `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]` for `0 <= i < n`.\nThis means `b = [a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1], a[0]]`. This `b` is clearly a permutation of `a`.\n\nNow, let's check the condition: `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]`.\nSubstitute `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]`:\nWe need `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} a[(i+1) % n]`.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that there exists a subset `S` with `0 < |S| < n` such that `sum_{i in S} a[i] = sum_{i in S} a[(i+1) % n]`.\nLet `A_S = {a[i] | i in S}` be the set of values from `a` at indices in `S`.\nLet `A_{P(S)} = {a[(i+1) % n] | i in S}` be the set of values from `a` that `b` places at indices in `S`.\nSince all elements `a[i]` are distinct, if the sum of elements in `A_S` equals the sum of elements in `A_{P(S)}`, it must be that the *multiset* of values `{a[i] | i in S}` is identical to the multiset `{a[(i+1) % n] | i in S}`.\nBecause all `a[i]` are distinct, this further implies that the *set* of values `A_S` must be identical to the set `A_{P(S)}`.\n\nIf `A_S = A_{P(S)}`, then because `a` has distinct elements and the mapping `i -> (i+1)%n` is a permutation of indices, it must be that the set of indices `S` is invariant under this permutation. That is, `S = {(i+1) % n | i in S}`.\n\nThe permutation `P(i) = (i+1) % n` generates a single cycle: `0 -> 1 -> ... -> n-1 -> 0`.\nAny set of indices `S` that is invariant under `P` must be a union of cycles of `P`. Since `P` consists of a single cycle of length `n`, the only non-empty set `S` that is invariant under `P` is the set of all indices `S = {0, 1, ..., n-1}`.\n\nHowever, the problem statement explicitly restricts `S` to be a non-empty proper subset of indices, meaning `0 < |S| < n`. This means `S` cannot be the set of all indices.\nTherefore, for any `S` satisfying `0 < |S| < n`, `S` cannot be invariant under `P`.\nThis implies `A_S != A_{P(S)}` (as sets), and thus `sum_{i in S} a[i] != sum_{i in S} a[(i+1) % n]`.\n\nSo, the construction `b[i] = a[(i+1)%n]` (a cyclic shift of `a`) always satisfies the condition for `n > 1`.\nFor `n = 1`, the condition `0 < |S| < n` cannot be met (there are no such subsets `S`). Thus, any permutation `b` works. A cyclic shift of `a = [a_0]` results in `b = [a_0]`, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, a simple cyclic shift of the input array `a` is always a valid solution.\n\nExample:\n`n = 4`\n`a = [1000, 100, 10, 1]`\nThe proposed `b` would be `[a[1], a[2], a[3], a[0]] = [100, 10, 1, 1000]`.\n\nThis solution is efficient, running in O(N) time.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # If n=1, there are no subsets S such that 0 < |S| < n.\n    # The condition is vacuously true. The only permutation is a itself.\n    # The cyclic shift logic below handles n=1 correctly as well.\n    # For a = [x], a[1:] + a[:1] results in [] + [x] = [x].\n    \n    # Construct b by cyclically shifting a.\n    # b[i] = a[(i+1)%n]\n    # This is equivalent to taking all elements from index 1 to n-1,\n    # and then appending the element at index 0.\n    b = a[1:] + a[:1]\n    \n    print(*(b))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```",
