There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Approach to the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Tennis Championship\" problem, and my main focus is on maximizing the games played by the winner in a knockout tournament. The key constraint here is that two players can only compete if the difference in their games played is at most one.\n\nMy thought process starts by establishing some notation. Let's denote the number of games a player has played as *k*. My goal is to maximize the *k* value for the ultimate winner. I'm thinking, \"how can I engineer this tournament structure so the winner plays as many games as possible, adhering to the rule?\"\n\nI'm thinking about the winner and how they can advance. To maximize the winner's games, I have to ensure they always have a valid opponent. I define a function, `f(k)`, to represent the minimum number of players needed to have a winner with `k` games, assuming the winner always plays against an opponent with a game count of either `k-1` or `k`. This seems like the most efficient way to structure the tournament for maximum winner games.\n\nI also define `P(k)` as the minimum number of players required for a winner to have played `k` games. This function seems central to the problem.\n\nI'm starting to visualize this. If the winner plays *X* games, they need enough opponents at each stage. I'm essentially tracing the tournament backwards from the winner's perspective. I am trying to figure out how many players I need to reach a winner with a certain number of games. For example, if I consider a final game (game *k* for the winner), the winner (who has *k-1* games) faces another player. This other player's game count must be either *k-1* or *k-2*.\n\nI'm beginning to formalize the player structure. Let's say player `W` wins *k* games. I'm considering the game progression, so I can analyze player availability per game:\n\nGame 1: `W` (0) vs. `P1` (0). `W` wins, `W` now has 1 game.\nGame 2: `W` (1) vs. `P2` (0 or 1). To maximize, I need to always ensure that `W` has a valid opponent.\n\nI'm now thinking about calculating the minimum players required to obtain a winner who has played a certain number of games. Let `N(k)` be the minimum players needed for a winner to have *k* games. I'm working on finding a recursive relationship, so I start to see where the minimal player amount stems from.\n\nFor `N(0)`, it's one player. `N(1)` takes 2 players. If my winner plays 2 games, I have to provide a base for games at 0, 1, and 2 counts, and that is a minimum of 3 players. I think I am on to something. I am going to keep going in this direction to deduce an algorithm to solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `F(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games, under the given rule. We want to find the maximum `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's analyze the rule `|games_A - games_B| <= 1`.\nSuppose a player `W` has played `k` games and is about to play their `(k+1)`-th game. `W` has won all `k` previous games.\n`W` needs an opponent `O`. `O` must have played `k'` games such that `|k - k'| <= 1`. So, `k'` can be `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1`.\nHowever, in a knockout tournament, if a player plays a game, they either win and continue, or lose and are eliminated. If `W` is about to play their `(k+1)`-th game, they must have won `k` games. An opponent `O` who has played `k+1` games would mean `O` has won `k+1` games. This implies `O` has played more games than `W`, which is not possible if `W` is trying to maximize their game count. `W` would be the player with the most games played at any point. So, `O` must have played `k-1` or `k` games.\n\nTo minimize the total number of players `F(k+1)` for `W` to play `k+1` games, `W` (who has played `k` games) needs an opponent `O`.\n1. If `O` has played `k` games: This means `O` has also won `k` games. So, `O` itself is a player who has played `k` games. The total players needed would be `F(k)` (for `W`) + `F(k)` (for `O`).\n2. If `O` has played `k-1` games: This means `O` has won `k-1` games. The total players needed would be `F(k)` (for `W`) + `F(k-1)` (for `O`).\n\nTo minimize `F(k+1)`, we should choose the option that requires fewer players. Since `F(k)` is an increasing function, `F(k-1)` is less than `F(k)`. Thus, the most efficient way to provide an opponent for `W` (who has played `k` games) is to find an opponent `O` who has played `k-1` games.\n\nThis leads to the recurrence relation: `F(k+1) = F(k) + F(k-1)`.\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence!\n\nLet's establish the base cases:\n- `F(0)`: A player who has played 0 games. This requires 1 player.\n- `F(1)`: A player plays 1 game. This requires 2 players (A vs B, A wins). So, `F(1) = 2`.\n\nUsing the recurrence `F(k+1) = F(k) + F(k-1)`:\n- `F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`. (To play 2 games, winner `W` (1 game) plays `O` (0 games). `W` needs `F(1)=2` players to get to 1 game. `O` needs `F(0)=1` player. Total `2+1=3` players).\n- `F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n- `F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`.\n- `F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 8 + 5 = 13`.\n\nThe sequence `F(k)` (for `k=0, 1, 2, ...`) is `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...`.\nThis is the standard Fibonacci sequence `fib(i)` shifted. If `fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, fib(4)=3, fib(5)=5, ...`, then `F(k) = fib(k+2)`.\n\nWe are given `n` players and need to find the maximum `k` such that `F(k) <= n`.\nSince `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently until they exceed `n`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `a = 1` (representing `F(0)`) and `b = 2` (representing `F(1)`).\n2. Initialize `k = 1` (since `F(1)=2` is the first meaningful game count).\n3. Loop while `b <= n`:\n   a. Calculate the next Fibonacci number: `temp = a + b`.\n   b. Update `a = b`.\n   c. Update `b = temp`.\n   d. Increment `k`.\n4. When the loop terminates, `b` has exceeded `n`. The previous value of `k` (before the last increment) corresponds to the maximum `F(k)` that was less than or equal to `n`. So, the answer is `k-1`.\n\nLet's trace with example `n=10`:\n- `a=1, b=2, k=1`.\n- `b=2 <= 10`. `temp = 1+2=3`. `a=2, b=3`. `k=2`.\n- `b=3 <= 10`. `temp = 2+3=5`. `a=3, b=5`. `k=3`.\n- `b=5 <= 10`. `temp = 3+5=8`. `a=5, b=8`. `k=4`.\n- `b=8 <= 10`. `temp = 5+8=13`. `a=8, b=13`. `k=5`.\n- `b=13 > 10`. Loop terminates.\n- The answer is `k-1 = 5-1 = 4`. This matches the example output.\n\nEdge cases:\n- `n=2`:\n  - `a=1, b=2, k=1`.\n  - `b=2 <= 2`. `temp = 1+2=3`. `a=2, b=3`. `k=2`.\n  - `b=3 > 2`. Loop terminates.\n  - Answer `k-1 = 2-1 = 1`. Correct.\n- `n=3`:\n  - `a=1, b=2, k=1`.\n  - `b=2 <= 3`. `temp = 1+2=3`. `a=2, b=3`. `k=2`.\n  - `b=3 <= 3`. `temp = 2+3=5`. `a=3, b=5`. `k=3`.\n  - `b=5 > 3`. Loop terminates.\n  - Answer `k-1 = 3-1 = 2`. Correct.\n- `n=4`:\n  - `a=1, b=2, k=1`.\n  - `b=2 <= 4`. `temp = 1+2=3`. `a=2, b=3`. `k=2`.\n  - `b=3 <= 4`. `temp = 2+3=5`. `a=3, b=5`. `k=3`.\n  - `b=5 > 4`. Loop terminates.\n  - Answer `k-1 = 3-1 = 2`. Correct.\n\nThe maximum value of `n` is `10^18`. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. `fib(90)` is approximately `2.88 * 10^18`. So, `k` will be around 90, which means the loop runs a small number of times. This approach is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # F(k) is the minimum number of players for the winner to play k games.\n    # F(0) = 1 (1 player has played 0 games)\n    # F(1) = 2 (2 players, winner plays 1 game)\n    # F(k+1) = F(k) + F(k-1) for k >= 1\n    # This is the Fibonacci sequence shifted.\n    # F(0)=1, F(1)=2, F(2)=3, F(3)=5, F(4)=8, ...\n    # This corresponds to fib(k+2) where fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1.\n\n    # Initialize a and b to F(0) and F(1) respectively.\n    a = 1 # Corresponds to F(k_current)\n    b = 2 # Corresponds to F(k_current + 1)\n    \n    # max_games will store the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n    # Initially, if n=2, winner can play 1 game.\n    max_games = 1 \n\n    # If n is 2, the loop condition b <= n (2 <= 2) is true,\n    # it will run once and max_games will correctly be 1.\n    # If n is 1, this problem is invalid (n >= 2).\n    \n    while b <= n:\n        # We can achieve max_games + 1 games.\n        # The number of players needed for max_games + 1 games is a + b.\n        next_fib = a + b\n        a = b\n        b = next_fib\n        max_games += 1\n        \n    print(max_games)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
