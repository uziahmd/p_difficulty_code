Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Flawed Flow Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Flawed Flow\" problem, and my initial thought is, \"This looks like a fun, but tricky, graph problem!\"  The goal is to direct the edges of an undirected graph in a way that satisfies some constraints related to flow. Let's dig into the details.\n\nFirst, I see the input: `n` vertices, `m` edges, and each edge has a capacity `c`.  The edges are undirected, but we need to *direct* them. And vertices 1 and `n` are the source and sink, which makes sense. Crucially, the problem guarantees a solution always exists.\n\nNow, the core conditions: flow conservation at intermediate nodes (meaning the sum of incoming flow equals the sum of outgoing flow for every node except the source and sink), no incoming edges at the source, and no cycles in the resulting directed graph. The no-cycles constraint is really the key here. It's a very strong condition.\n\nMy initial instinct is that the \"no cycles\" condition is the biggest hint. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) inherently has a topological ordering. So, somehow, I need to figure out how to direct the edges such that I can maintain a topological ordering of the vertices.  If I can find a topological sort, all edges would point in a direction that respects this order, and I'd avoid cycles.\n\nThe problem states \"it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph\".  That's important. This means the given `c` values *are* a valid maximum flow, and all I need to do is correctly direct the edges while satisfying the flow conservation and acyclicity.\n\nSo, how do I find this topological order?  I'm thinking, perhaps, I can build up the flow from the source, vertex 1.  It *must* have all its edges directed outwards. Maybe I can keep track of the \"net flow\" needed at each vertex, and build the graph out from the source, trying to maintain flow conservation. It's almost like a recursive search, growing the solution step by step. I'm going to have to keep the flow conservation and no-cycle conditions in mind as I do that.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to direct edges of a given undirected graph, each with a specified flow volume `ci`, such that a valid maximum flow is formed. The conditions are:\n1.  **Flow Conservation:** For any intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the sum of incoming flow equals the sum of outgoing flow.\n2.  **Source Condition:** Vertex 1 (source) has no incoming edges.\n3.  **No Cycles:** The resulting directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" condition is very strong. It implies that we can find a topological ordering of the vertices. If we can assign a \"level\" or \"distance\" to each vertex such that flow always goes from a lower-level vertex to a higher-level vertex, then no cycles can exist.\n\nLet's consider the flow conservation at an intermediate vertex `v`. If we direct an edge `(u, v)` with flow `c` as `u -> v`, it contributes `c` to `v`'s incoming flow. If we direct it as `v -> u`, it contributes `c` to `v`'s outgoing flow. The net effect on `v`'s \"balance\" is `+c` for incoming and `-c` for outgoing. For flow conservation, `v`'s balance must be 0.\n\nThe source vertex 1 must have all its edges directed outwards. This means for any edge `(1, u)`, the flow must be `1 -> u`. This is a fixed initial direction.\n\nThe key insight is to use a topological sort-like approach. Since vertex 1 has no incoming edges and there are no cycles, vertex 1 must be the first vertex in any topological ordering. We can process vertices in a way that respects this. A Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) can be used.\n\nLet's maintain a `balance` for each vertex `v`. Initially, all `balance[v]` are 0.\nWhen we decide to direct an edge `(u, v)` with flow `c` as `u -> v`:\n*   `balance[u]` decreases by `c` (flow leaves `u`).\n*   `balance[v]` increases by `c` (flow enters `v`).\n\nThe goal is for `balance[v]` to be 0 for all `v` (1 < `v` < `n`). Vertex 1's balance will be negative (total outgoing flow), and vertex `n`'s balance will be positive (total incoming flow).\n\nWe can use a queue-based approach similar to Kahn's algorithm for topological sort.\n1.  Initialize `balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\n2.  Initialize a queue `q`.\n3.  Add vertex 1 to the queue.\n4.  While the queue is not empty:\n    a.  Dequeue a vertex `u`.\n    b.  For each undirected edge `(u, v)` with flow `c` that has *not yet been directed*:\n        i.  If `balance[u] < 0`: This means `u` has already sent out more flow than it received. It must receive more flow to balance itself, or it must *not* send out more flow. This state indicates an issue if we are trying to only send flow *out* from `u`.\n        ii. If `balance[u] == 0`: This means `u` is currently balanced. To maintain flow conservation, any flow `u` sends out must be compensated by incoming flow. Since we want to direct edges `u -> v` to satisfy the no-cycle condition, let's prioritize sending flow *out* from `u` if `u` is the current \"source\" of flow in our processing.\n        iii. If `balance[u] > 0`: This means `u` has received more flow than it sent out. It *must* send out flow. So, direct the edge `u -> v`. Update `balance[u] -= c` and `balance[v] += c`. If `balance[v]` becomes positive, enqueue `v`.\n\nThis greedy strategy needs refinement. The problem states \"vertex 1 has no incoming edges\", and \"no cycles\". This strongly suggests a topological ordering. We can iterate through vertices in a topological order.\nA simpler approach that guarantees acyclicity is to use a single DFS traversal starting from vertex 1. During the DFS, when we traverse an edge `(u, v)`:\n*   If `v` is not yet visited, it means `v` is \"further\" from the source in the DFS tree. We can direct `u -> v`.\n*   If `v` is already visited, it means `v` is \"closer\" to the source or in a different branch. If we direct `u -> v`, it might create a cycle. If we direct `v -> u`, it might also create a cycle.\n\nThe provided solution uses a specific approach that leverages the \"no cycles\" and \"source has no incoming\" conditions. It's essentially a form of topological sort by processing nodes whose \"net outgoing flow\" is positive, or whose \"net incoming flow\" is negative, and pushing this flow forward.\n\nLet's refine the idea:\nWe need to determine for each vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`) its total incoming flow and total outgoing flow. The total flow through all edges incident to `v` is `sum(c_i)`. Let this be `total_incident_flow[v]`. For flow conservation, `incoming_flow[v] = outgoing_flow[v] = total_incident_flow[v] / 2`.\nThis means we need to ensure that `sum(c_i)` for edges directed into `v` is exactly `total_incident_flow[v] / 2`.\n\nConsider the sum of all `c_i` values incident to a vertex `v`. Let this sum be `S_v`.\nFor an intermediate vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the total flow entering `v` must equal the total flow leaving `v`. This sum must be `S_v / 2`.\nFor vertex 1, all `S_1` must be outgoing flow.\nFor vertex `n`, all `S_n` must be incoming flow.\n\nThis gives us a target for each vertex:\n*   `target_incoming[v] = S_v / 2` for `1 < v < n`\n*   `target_incoming[1] = 0`\n*   `target_incoming[n] = S_n` (all flow to `n` is incoming)\n\n*   `target_outgoing[v] = S_v / 2` for `1 < v < n`\n*   `target_outgoing[1] = S_1` (all flow from `1` is outgoing)\n*   `target_outgoing[n] = 0`\n\nWe can use a queue to process vertices that have a \"deficit\" or \"surplus\" of flow.\nLet `current_incoming[v]` be the sum of `c_i` for edges directed into `v` so far. Initially all are 0.\nLet `current_outgoing[v]` be the sum of `c_i` for edges directed out of `v` so far. Initially all are 0.\n\n1.  Calculate `S_v` for all `v`. Store edges along with their original index.\n2.  Initialize `current_incoming[v] = 0` for all `v`.\n3.  Initialize a queue `q`.\n4.  Add vertex `n` to the queue. (Wait, why `n`? The problem states source is 1, so flow goes from 1 to `n`. It's more natural to start from 1. Let's try starting from 1).\n\nA common technique for these \"balance\" problems is to use a DFS:\nMaintain `flow_balance[v]` for each vertex `v`. This represents the net flow that *must* exit `v` (if positive) or *must* enter `v` (if negative) to satisfy flow conservation for `v` and its descendants in the DFS tree.\n\nLet's use a DFS approach. The \"no cycles\" condition is key. A DFS traversal naturally defines a tree (or forest). If we direct edges downwards in this DFS tree, we get an acyclic graph. What about cross-edges?\n\nConsider a standard DFS from vertex 1.\n`visited` array to keep track of visited nodes.\n`ans` array to store directions (0 for `a -> b`, 1 for `b -> a`).\n`adj` list storing `(neighbor, flow_capacity, edge_index)`.\n\n`dfs(u, parent)`:\n  `visited[u] = True`\n  `current_node_balance = 0` (this will track how much flow `u` needs to send *out* to its children, or receive from them)\n\n  For each `(v, c, edge_idx)` adjacent to `u`:\n    If `v == parent`: continue (don't go back up the DFS tree immediately)\n    If `visited[v]`:\n      // `v` is already visited.

This is where the logic breaks for source/sink.)\n\nThe issue with the `target_incoming_flow_needed` for source/sink is that they don't conserve flow.\nThe `dfs(u, parent_edge_idx)` should return the net flow that `u` *pushes towards its parent* (if positive) or *pulls from its parent* (if negative) to satisfy flow conservation for `u` and its subtree, *excluding* the edge to its parent.\n\nLet `net_flow_out_of_u_to_parent` be the value returned by `dfs(u, parent_edge_idx)`.\nThis value represents `(total_flow_u_needs_to_send_out) - (total_flow_u_has_sent_out_to_children_or_back_edges)`.\nOr, `(total_flow_u_has_received_from_children_or_back_edges) - (total_flow_u_needs_to_receive)`.\n\nLet `current_balance[u]` be the amount of flow that *has accumulated* at `u` from its children and cross-edges.\n`dfs(u, p_edge_idx)`:\n  `visited[u] = True`\n  `current_balance[u] = 0`\n\n  For each `(v, c, edge_idx)` adjacent to `u`:\n    If `edge_idx == p_edge_idx`: continue\n    If `visited[v]`:\n      // `v` is an already visited node.

This `current_balance[1]` should be 0 because vertex 1 has no incoming edges. All its edges are outgoing. This means `current_balance[1]` should reflect the total flow that 1 sends out. The problem states \"vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges\". This is automatically handled by the DFS: the DFS starts at 1, so 1 has no parent edge. Its `current_balance[1]` will be the sum of flows it sends to its children/back-edges minus flows it receives from them. The problem guarantee \"a solution always exists\" means `current_balance[1]` will correctly be the negative of the total max flow value, which is then balanced by the sink.\n\nLet's re-trace the example with this refined logic:\nInput:\n3 3\n3 2 10 (edge 0: (3,2))\n1 2 10 (edge 1: (1,2))\n3 1 5  (edge 2: (3,1))\n\nAdj list (stores original (u,v) pair for direction check):\n1: [(2,10,1, (1,2)), (3,5,2, (3,1))]\n2: [(3,10,0, (3,2)), (1,10,1, (1,2))]\n3: [(2,10,0, (3,2)), (1,5,2, (3,1))]\n\nInitialize `ans = [0, 0, 0]`, `visited = [F, F, F]`\nCall `dfs(1, -1)`:\n\n`dfs(1, -1)`:\n  `visited[1] = True`\n  `current_balance[1] = 0`\n\n  Neighbors of 1:\n  1. `(2, 10, 1, (1,2))`:\n     `v = 2`, `c = 10`, `edge_idx = 1`. `v` is not visited.\n     Call `dfs(2, 1)`:\n       `visited[2] = True`\n       `current_balance[2] = 0`\n       Neighbors of 2:\n       1. `(3, 10, 0, (3,2))`:\n          `v = 3`, `c = 10`, `edge_idx = 0`. `v` is not visited.\n          Call `dfs(3, 0)`:\n            `visited[3] = True`\n            `current_balance[3] = 0`\n            Neighbors of 3:\n            1. `(2, 10, 0, (3,2))`: `edge_idx = 0` is parent edge.

Total outgoing = 15. Incoming = 0. OK.\nVertex 2 (intermediate): Incoming: `1->2` (10). Outgoing: `2->3` (10). Balance = 0. OK.\nVertex 3 (sink): Incoming: `2->3` (10), `1->3` (5). Total incoming = 15. Outgoing = 0. OK.\nNo cycles: `1 -> 2 -> 3`. `1 -> 3`. This is a DAG. OK.\nThe example output is valid.\n\nMy DFS logic for visited nodes (cross-edges) might be the issue.\n\"If `v` is visited, it means `v` is 'closer' to the source or in a different branch. To ensure acyclicity, we must direct flow from `v` to `u`.\"\nThis is a standard way to handle cross-edges in a DFS to maintain acyclicity relative to the DFS tree. If `v` is visited and `v` is not the parent of `u`, then `v` must have been visited *before* `u`. So `v` is \"earlier\" in the topological order. Therefore, flow must go `v -> u`.\n\nThe problem states \"If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\" So my valid solution should be accepted. Let's re-verify my solution's validity.\n\nMy solution:\n`3 -> 2` (10)\n`2 -> 1` (10)\n`3 -> 1` (5)\n\nVertex 1 (source): Incoming: `2->1` (10), `3->1` (5). Total incoming = 15. This violates \"vertex 1 has no incoming edges\"!\nSo my DFS logic is indeed flawed.\n\nThe issue is with the source condition: \"vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges\".\nMy DFS implicitly directs edges by assuming that if `v` is visited, `v` is \"earlier\" and thus flow should go `v -> u`. This is good for acyclicity but doesn't guarantee the source condition.\n\nA better way to ensure the source condition is to make sure that any edge incident to vertex 1 is directed `1 -> v`. This is a hard constraint.\nWhat if we process vertex 1 first, directing all its edges outwards?\nThen use a modified DFS/BFS that ensures the no-cycle condition and flow conservation.\n\nLet's try a different approach. The \"no cycles\" condition implies a topological ordering.\nIf we can find a topological ordering, say `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n`, then for any edge `(u, v)` with `u` appearing before `v` in the ordering, the flow must be `u -> v`.\n\nHow to find such a topological ordering that also satisfies flow conservation?\nThis smells like a network flow problem itself.\nHowever, the problem is simpler because the flow values `c_i` are *given*. We just need directions.\n\nConsider the \"net flow\" for each node.\nFor an intermediate node `v`, `NetFlow(v) = Incoming(v) - Outgoing(v) = 0`.\nFor source `1`, `NetFlow(1) = Incoming(1) - Outgoing(1) = 0 - Outgoing(1) < 0`.\nFor sink `n`, `NetFlow(n) = Incoming(n) - Outgoing(n) > 0`.\n\nLet `balance[v]` be the sum of `c_i` for edges directed `v -> neighbor` minus sum of `c_i` for edges directed `neighbor -> v`.\nWe want `balance[v] = 0` for `1 < v < n`.\nFor `v = 1`, `balance[1]` should be `sum(c_i)` for all incident edges.\nFor `v = n`, `balance[n]` should be `-sum(c_i)` for all incident edges.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying: for `1 < v < n`, `sum(incoming_c_i) = sum(outgoing_c_i)`.\nLet `total_incident_flow[v]` be the sum of `c_i` for all edges connected to `v`.\nThen we need `sum(incoming_c_i) = total_incident_flow[v] / 2`.\n\nWe can use a BFS-like approach. Keep track of `current_flow_in[v]`, the amount of flow that has been directed *into* `v` so far.\nInitially, `current_flow_in[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nA queue `q` will store vertices `u` that have `current_flow_in[u]` equal to `total_incident_flow[u] / 2` (or `total_incident_flow[u]` for `n`, or `0` for `1`) and have unprocessed edges.\n\nThis is a variation of a topological sort where nodes are processed when their \"flow requirements\" are met.\nLet `required_in_flow[v]` be `total_incident_flow[v] / 2` for `1 < v < n`, `0` for `v = 1`, and `total_incident_flow[n]` for `v = n`.\nLet `current_in_flow[v]` be the actual flow directed into `v` so far.\nInitially, `current_in_flow[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nA queue `Q` contains nodes `u` such that `current_in_flow[u]` has *not yet reached* `required_in_flow[u]`, but all edges incident to `u` *except one* have been directed, and that one remaining edge is to `u`'s parent in the BFS tree. This is getting complicated.\n\nThe most robust way to handle \"no cycles\" and \"source has no incoming\" is to use a topological sort.\nIf a topological sort exists, we can direct edges `u -> v` if `u` comes before `v` in the sort.\nThe problem is that we don't know the topological sort.\n\nA simpler DFS solution for similar problems (like finding a Hamiltonian path in a DAG, or reconstructing a DAG from flow values) often involves a recursive function that returns the *net flow* that a subtree needs to send to its parent or receive from its parent.\n\nLet `dfs(u, p)` be a function that returns the net flow `u` needs to send *to* `p` (positive) or *receive from* `p` (negative).\n`adj` stores `(v, c, edge_idx, original_a, original_b)`.\n\n`dfs(u, p)`:\n  `visited[u] = True`\n  `flow_to_balance_u = 0` // This is the net flow `u` has received from its children/back-edges.\n\n  For each `(v, c, edge_idx, original_a, original_b)` adjacent to `u`:\n    If `v == p`: continue\n    If `visited[v]`:\n      // `v` is already visited and not parent.

If `v=1` and `u` is some other node, then `1` is earlier, so flow must be `1 -> u`. My logic directs `v -> u` (so `1 -> u` if `v=1`).\nBut if `u=1` and `v` is some other node, and `v` is visited, then `v` is earlier, so flow `v -> u` (so `v -> 1`). This is what causes the source to have incoming flow.\n\nThis means the \"visited node implies flow `v -> u`\" rule is too simple for the source.\nA different approach:\nThe problem is about finding a topological ordering. The \"no cycles\" implies a DAG.\nThe total flow entering `n` must be equal to the total flow leaving `1`. Let this total flow be `F`.\nFor any node `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), `sum(incoming_flow) = sum(outgoing_flow)`.\nFor `1`, `sum(incoming_flow) = 0`.\nFor `n`, `sum(outgoing_flow) = 0`.\n\nThis can be modeled as a system of equations.\nFor each edge `(a, b)` with flow `c`, we choose `x_i = 0` for `a -> b` and `x_i = 1` for `b -> a`.\nFor each node `v`: `sum_{edge (u,v) with flow c} (c * (1-x_i)) + sum_{edge (v,w) with flow c} (c * x_i) = sum_{edge (u,v) with flow c} (c * x_i) + sum_{edge (v,w) with flow c} (c * (1-x_i))`\nThis simplifies to `sum_{edge (u,v) with flow c} (c * (1-2x_i)) = 0`.\nThe `(1-2x_i)` term is `+1` if `u -> v` and `-1` if `v -> u`.\nSo `sum (c * (direction_from_v_to_neighbor)) = 0`.\nThis is exactly `balance[v] = 0`.\n\nThe condition \"vertex 1 has no incoming edges\" means for any edge `(1, v)` with flow `c`, it must be `1 -> v`. This fixes the direction of all edges connected to `1`.\nLet's apply this.\nInitialize `ans` array.\nFor each edge `(a_i, b_i, c_i, edge_idx)`:\n  If `a_i == 1`: `ans[edge_idx] = 0` (`1 -> b_i`).\n  If `b_i == 1`: `ans[edge_idx] = 1` (`1 -> a_i`).\n  (Note: an edge can only be connected to 1 once.

Returns `flow_to_balance_1 = -15`.\n  This value is ignored.\n\nThis still doesn't process edge 0 `(3,2)`. The DFS must be called on *all* nodes if they haven't been visited.\nBut the problem guarantees a connected graph, and we start DFS from 1. So all nodes will be visited.\nThe problem is that the DFS needs to be able to traverse edges that are *already directed* to reach other nodes.\nThe `if ans[edge_idx] is not -1: continue` causes the DFS to stop traversing directed edges.\n\nA better way:\n1.  Initialize `ans = [-1]*m`.\n2.  Initialize `current_balance = [0]*(n+1)`.\n3.

The `current_balance[u]` is updated based on decisions made in the DFS subtree.\nThe key for intermediate nodes is that `current_balance[u]` must be 0 *after* all edges incident to `u` are directed.\nThe value returned by `dfs(u, p_idx)` is the `current_balance[u]` after processing all children and back-edges.\nThis value then implies how the parent edge `(p, u)` should be directed.\nThe problem guarantees a solution, so `current_balance[u]` will be correctly 0 for intermediate nodes.\nThe final `current_balance[1]` will be the negative of the total max flow, and `current_balance[n]` will be the total max flow.\n\nLet's re-trace Example 1 with this **final** logic:\n`ans = [-1, -1, -1]`\n`current_balance = [0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\n**Pre-process edges connected to 1:**\nEdge 1: (1,2,10). `a_i=1`. `ans[1] = 0` (`1 -> 2`).\n  `current_balance[1] -= 10` (`-10`)\n  `current_balance[2] += 10` (`10`)\nEdge 2: (3,1,5). `b_i=1`. `ans[2] = 1` (`1 -> 3`).\n  `current_balance[1] -= 5` (`-15`)\n  `current_balance[3] += 5` (`5`)\n`ans = [-1, 0, 1]`\n`current_balance = [0, -15, 10, 5]`\n\n`visited = [F, F, F, F]`\nCall `dfs(1, -1)`:\n  `visited[1] = True`\n  `flow_to_balance_at_1 = current_balance[1] = -15` (This is the `current_balance[u]` that the function will modify and return)\n\n  Neighbors of 1:\n  1. `(2, 10, 1, (1,2))`: `edge_idx=1`. `p_idx = -1`. `ans[1]` is 0.

Returns `flow_to_balance_at_1 = -15`.\n\nThis still doesn't work. The issue is that the DFS needs to *explore* all edges to find unvisited nodes, even if those edges are already directed. The `if ans[edge_idx] is not -1: continue` must be removed from the main loop, or moved to after `visited[v]` check.\n\nThe actual DFS must visit all nodes *once*. The `visited` array ensures this.\nWhen processing an edge `(u, v)`:\n1.  If `v` is the parent `p` (identified by `p_idx`), skip.\n2.  If `v` is already `visited` (and not `p`): This is a back-edge or cross-edge.\n    If `ans[edge_idx]` is already set, it means this edge was fixed by being connected to source 1. Don't touch it.\n    If `ans[edge_idx]` is NOT set, then direct `v -> u` to avoid cycles. Update `current_balance[u] += c`.\n3.  If `v` is NOT `visited`: This is a tree edge.\n    If `ans[edge_idx]` is already set, it means this edge was fixed by being connected to source 1. Don't touch it. Its contribution is in `current_balance`. Recurse `dfs(v, edge_idx)`.\n    If `ans[edge_idx]` is NOT set, recurse `dfs(v, edge_idx)`. Direct `u -> v` or `v -> u` based on returned value. Update `current_balance[u]`.\n\nThe logic for handling already-directed edges must be *outside* the DFS function.\nThe DFS should only be responsible for directing *undirected* edges.\n\nRevised approach:\n1.  Initialize `ans = [-1]*m`.\n2.  Initialize `final_balance = [0]*(n+1)`. This will be the true flow balance for each node.\n3.  Build `adj` list: `(v, c, edge_idx, original_a, original_b)`.\n4.
