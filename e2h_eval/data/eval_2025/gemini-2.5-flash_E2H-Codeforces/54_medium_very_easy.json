Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Alright, let's break down this problem. I need to write a Python script to find three vertices in a regular n-gon where the angle they form is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'.**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the angles in a regular n-gon. All the vertices lie on a circle, and the angle subtended by a chord at any point on the circumference is half the angle at the center. I'm going to fix one vertex (let's call it v2) and then try to find the other two (v1 and v3). Since this is a regular polygon, it doesn't really matter which vertex I pick as v2, so I'll just pick vertex 1.\n\nThe angle v1-v2-v3 is an inscribed angle, and its measure is half the central angle that spans the arc between v1 and v3 (excluding v2). To make it easy to think about, let's number the vertices clockwise from 1 to n. If I make vertex 1 as v2 and v1 will be 2 ( just by fixing v1's index to 2, it is easy to find v3), and v3 is any other vertex except 1, from 3 to n. The central angle will be proportional to the number of vertices on that arc. If v3 is vertex k, there will be k-2 steps. The central angle is (k-2) * (360/n), so the inscribed angle will be (k-2) * (180/n).\n\nI made an error in first attempt. I must carefully measure the number of steps and the relation among these angles. This new formula seems good. So my goal is to find a vertex k such that angle (k-2) * (180/n) is closest to my target angle 'a'. It can be verified with n=3, a=67, then, |0*180/3-67|, |60-67|.\n\nIf n = 3 and the target is 67, since there are only 60 degrees possible, and absolute value of differences are equal so I should choose it and calculate.\n\nI'll iterate through all the possible values of k (from 3 to n). For each k, I'll calculate the angle (k-2) * (180/n), and then find the difference from the desired angle 'a'. I'll keep track of the minimum difference and the corresponding vertex k. Finally, I will be outputting (v1,v2,v3) as (2,1,2+best_k). The best_k found during iteration of k.\n\nI should be aware that if multiple values of K result in identical difference. So just pick the first which has a tie in difference.\n\nI checked a bunch of example cases, and the logic seems solid. There shouldn't be any floating-point precision issues because the angle difference will be significantly larger than machine epsilon, as the range of n is small.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1`, `v2`, `v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle formed at `v2` (i.e., angle `v1-v2-v3`) is as close as possible to a given target angle `a`. We need to minimize `|angle(v1-v2-v3) - a|`.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular N-gon**\n\nAll vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices on the circle (an inscribed angle) subtends an arc. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\nLet's fix the vertex `v2` to be vertex `1` (due to symmetry, any choice for `v2` will lead to the same set of possible angle values).\nLet `v1` be vertex `2`.\nThen `v3` must be a vertex distinct from `1` and `2`. Let `v3` be vertex `j`.\nThe vertices are numbered `1` to `n` clockwise.\nThe angle `2-1-j` subtends the arc from vertex `2` to vertex `j` (the arc that does not pass through vertex `1`).\nThe number of edges along this arc is `j - 2`.\nEach edge of a regular `n`-gon subtends a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\nSo, the central angle subtended by the arc from `2` to `j` is `(j - 2) * (360/n)` degrees.\nThe inscribed angle `2-1-j` is half of this central angle:\n`angle(2-1-j) = (j - 2) * (360/n) / 2 = (j - 2) * (180/n)`.\n\nLet `k = j - 2`.\nSince `v3` (`j`) must be distinct from `v1` (`2`) and `v2` (`1`), `j` can range from `3` to `n`.\nIf `j = 3`, `k = 3 - 2 = 1`.\nIf `j = n`, `k = n - 2`.\nSo, `k` can take any integer value from `1` to `n-2`.\n\nThe possible angles that can be formed are `k * (180.0 / n)` for `k` in the range `[1, n-2]`.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\n1.  Initialize `min_diff` to a very large number (e.g., `float('inf')`) and `best_k` to `-1`.\n2.  Calculate the base angle unit: `angle_unit = 180.0 / n`.\n3.  Iterate `k` from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive):\n    *   Calculate the `current_angle = k * angle_unit`.\n    *   Calculate the difference `current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    *   If `current_diff` is less than `min_diff`:\n        *   Update `min_diff = current_diff`.\n        *   Update `best_k = k`.\n    *   (If `current_diff` is equal to `min_diff`, we don't update, which implicitly means we pick the smallest `k` that achieves the minimum difference. This is acceptable as per the problem statement: \"If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\")\n4.  After the loop, `best_k` will hold the value that results in the angle closest to `a`.\n5.  Print the vertices: `v1 = 2`, `v2 = 1`, `v3 = 2 + best_k`. These vertices are guaranteed to be distinct: `1`, `2`, and `2 + best_k` (since `best_k >= 1`, `2 + best_k >= 3`). All vertex indices will be within `[1, n]`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=67)**\n\n1.  `n = 4`, `a = 67`.\n2.  `min_diff = float('inf')`, `best_k = -1`.\n3.  `angle_unit = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`.\n4.  Loop for `k` from `1` to `n-2 = 2`:\n    *   **k = 1**:\n        *   `current_angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`.\n        *   `current_diff = abs(45.0 - 67) = 22.0`.\n        *   `22.0 < float('inf')`, so update: `min_diff = 22.0`, `best_k = 1`.\n    *   **k = 2**:\n        *   `current_angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`.\n        *   `current_diff = abs(90.0 - 67) = 23.0`.\n        *   `23.0` is not less than `22.0`, so no update.\n5.  Loop ends. `best_k = 1`.\n6.  Print `2`, `1`, `2 + 1 = 3`. Output: `2 1 3`.\n\nThis approach is efficient enough for `n` up to `10^5` as it involves a single loop proportional to `n`. Standard floating-point precision in Python (double precision) is sufficient for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = -1\n\n    # The possible angles are k * (180/n), where k represents the number of edges\n    # on the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2).\n    # k can range from 1 to n-2.\n\n    # We fix v2 as vertex 1.\n    # We fix v1 as vertex 2.\n    # Then v3 will be vertex 2 + k.\n    # This choice ensures that v1, v2, v3 are distinct:\n    # v2 = 1\n    # v1 = 2\n    # v3 = 2 + k (since k >= 1, 2+k >= 3)\n    # All vertices are within the valid range [1, n] because max k is n-2,\n    # so max v3 is 2 + (n-2) = n.\n\n    angle_unit = 180.0 / n\n\n    # Iterate k from 1 to n-2 (inclusive)\n    for k in range(1, n - 1): \n        current_angle = k * angle_unit\n        current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n\n        if current_diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = current_diff\n            best_k = k\n        # If current_diff == min_diff, we keep the existing best_k (which is the smaller k).\n        # This is fine as any optimal solution is acceptable.\n\n    # Output the vertices: v1, v2, v3\n    # Based on our choice: v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+best_k\n    print(2, 1, 2 + best_k)\n\n# Call the solve function to run the solution\nsolve()\n\n```",
