For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Triad Classifier - Final Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to write a Python script that can classify three-note triads as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange.\" I've got a solid plan now.\n\nFirst, I'll map the musical notes to numerical values, like C=0, C#=1, and so on. This will make it easier to calculate distances in semitones.  To ensure these values are computed correctly I'll use the modular arithmetic operator `%`.\n\nI need to handle the cyclic nature of the notes.  I'll use the formula `(n2 - n1 + 12) % 12` to calculate the distance between any two notes, `n1` and `n2`, ensuring I get a positive value from `n1` to `n2`, even across the cycle.\n\nThe core of the logic is to check all possible orderings of the three input notes. Since the triad is unordered, I'll use `itertools.permutations` to efficiently generate all six possible permutations. For each permutation, I'll check if it forms a major or minor triad.\n\nA major triad has intervals of 4 and 3 semitones between the notes, while a minor triad has intervals of 3 and 4 semitones.  The order *matters* - so I need to check both `(4, 3)` and `(3, 4)` separately.  Since the problem guarantees a unique classification, I can return as soon as I find a match. If no permutation matches, it's \"strange\".\n\nI'll read the input notes from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, convert them to their numerical values, and then iterate through the permutations.  My final check involves verifying that the distance calculations are correct and handle the cyclical nature correctly. The modular arithmetic is crucial here. The code also takes into account that notes are unordered. The `itertools.permutations` are used to check all orders. This should handle all cases correctly, given the unambiguous classification condition. I'm ready to write the code.\n",
