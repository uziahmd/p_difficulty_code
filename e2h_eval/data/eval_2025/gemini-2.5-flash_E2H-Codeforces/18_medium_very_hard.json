    "thought": "**My Plan to Tackle the Frog Jumping Problem**\n\nOkay, here's my line of thinking. I need to write a Python script to solve the \"Frog Jumping\" problem.  The frog can move by adding or subtracting two positive integers, `a` and `b`. The frog's path is constrained to the interval `[0, x]`, and I want to calculate `f(x)`, which is the number of *distinct* integers the frog can reach starting from 0, given this constraint. The ultimate goal is to find the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from 0 to `m`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand `f(x)` better.  This is basically a reachability problem, but with restrictions.  I'm thinking of this as a graph problem. The nodes are integers, and edges represent jumps of `+a` or `-b`. The constraint `[0, x]` means I can only use nodes within this interval, and jumps must stay within it. So, for a given `x`, the set of reachable points, `S_x`, is crucial.\n\nInitially, I considered calculating the set of all reachable points `R` *without* the `x` constraint, just using `+a` and `-b` jumps. Any reachable number will have the form `c1 * a - c2 * b` for non-negative integers `c1` and `c2`. This means all reachable points must be multiples of the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, `g = gcd(a, b)`. So, the reachable points are multiples of `g`.\n\nThe problem is that I need to account for intermediate steps also, not just start and end.\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the Frobenius coin problem. The question becomes which non-negative multiples of `g` can be reached from 0 using these jumps, *always staying non-negative*. This involves some subtle combinatorics/number theory. I know there's a connection to the Frobenius number (the largest amount that cannot be obtained using only coins of denominations `a` and `b`), which is helpful.\n\nI thought about dynamic programming or Dijkstra's algorithm. If I define a `dist` array where `dist[i]` represents the minimum \"value\" needed to reach a number whose remainder is `i` after division by `a`, this is a good starting point. The jumps can then update my distances. But the values could get too large and the Dijkstra too slow.\n\nSpecifically, I attempted using Dijkstra's algorithm with the remainders modulo `a` as my states. But this approach is computationally intensive, as I'll have to iterate over up to potentially very large numbers.\n\nTo calculate `f(x)`, I must compute the set of all reachable integers from 0 to x.\nI can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), from 0 and keep track of all visited nodes. For a specific `x`, I will apply `f(x)`. It would be a bit slow, but I can use this to find the pattern. It's time consuming, as `m` can be large. This is still too slow for large values of x and `m`.\n\nThe problem appears to be in finding the most efficient way to compute `f(x)`. I need to figure out which approach will be fastest and minimize the amount of looping I do, but I'm not yet sure of the optimal solution. I need to find something more efficient. Finding the minimal intermediate value (i.e. minimal k with remainder i for which we can reach it) is an interesting concept. This leads me to BFS. However, this is still too slow for the problem.\n\nThis problem is tricky. The key is finding a way to efficiently calculate `f(x)`. While the direct graph search works, it's not fast enough for the expected input size. I'll need to rethink this, possibly by leveraging number theory more effectively.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to calculate `sum(f(i) for i in range(m+1))`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps outside the interval `[0, x]`. The frog starts at `0` and can jump `+a` or `-b`.\n\nLet `g = gcd(a, b)`. Any position reachable by the frog must be a multiple of `g`. If `a` and `b` are both large, and `g=1`, then `f(x)` can grow quickly. If `g > 1`, then `f(x)` will be `0` for `x < g`.\n\nLet's define `min_bound[k]` as the minimum `X` such that position `k` is reachable from `0` with all intermediate jumps staying within `[0, X]`.\nWe want to compute `min_bound[k]` for all `k` from `0` to `m`.\nThis can be modeled as a shortest path problem. The nodes are integers `0, 1, ..., m`. The \"distance\" `min_bound[k]` is the minimum `X` required.\nInitialize `min_bound[0] = 0` and `min_bound[k] = infinity` for `k > 0`.\nUse a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` storing `(X, k)` pairs, ordered by `X`.\nPush `(0, 0)` onto `pq`.\n\nWhen we extract `(current_X, current_k)` from `pq`:\n1. If `current_X > min_bound[current_k]`, we've found a shorter path already, so skip.\n2. Consider jumping to `current_k + a`:\n   `next_k = current_k + a`.\n   `next_X = max(current_X, next_k)`.\n   If `next_k <= m` and `next_X < min_bound[next_k]`:\n     `min_bound[next_k] = next_X`.\n     Push `(next_X, next_k)` to `pq`.\n3. Consider jumping to `current_k - b`:\n   `next_k = current_k - b`.\n   `next_X = current_X`. (The maximum value seen so far doesn't change by jumping downwards).\n   If `next_k >= 0` and `next_X < min_bound[next_k]`:\n     `min_bound[next_k] = next_X`.\n     Push `(next_X, next_k)` to `pq`.\n\nThis Dijkstra-like algorithm computes `min_bound[k]` for all `k` from `0` to `m`.\nThe maximum value of `k` is `m = 10^9`. This is too large for a direct Dijkstra.\nHowever, `a` and `b` are at most `10^5`.\nLet's analyze the `min_bound` values.\nIf `current_k` is sufficiently large (e.g., `current_k >= a + b`), jumping `+a` or `-b` will likely not change `current_X`.\nSpecifically, if `current_k >= max(a,b)`, then `current_k+a` or `current_k-b` will likely not exceed `current_X` unless `current_X` was already `current_k`.\nThe crucial observation is that `min_bound[k]` can only increase when `k` increases.\nFor `k > a+b`, `min_bound[k]` will likely be `k` itself.\nThis is because if `k` is reachable, then `k+a` is reachable (via `k -> k+a`) and `k-b` is reachable (via `k -> k-b`).\nIf `k` is large enough, `k-b >= 0`. So `min_bound[k+a] = max(min_bound[k], k+a)` and `min_bound[k-b] = min_bound[k]`.\nThis means that for `k` large enough, `min_bound[k]` becomes `k` for all reachable `k`.\nThe \"large enough\" threshold is roughly `a+b`.\nLet's compute `min_bound[k]` for `k` up to `2 * (a+b)` or `max(a,b) + max(a,b) + a+b`. A safe upper bound for the \"transition region\" is `max_val_to_compute = 2 * (a+b)`.\nSince `a,b <= 10^5`, `max_val_to_compute` is around `4 * 10^5`. This is small enough for Dijkstra.\nLet `N = 2 * (a+b)`. We compute `min_bound[k]` for `k` in `[0, N]`.\nThe state in Dijkstra is `(X, k)`. The maximum `X` can be `N`. The maximum `k` is `N`.\nThe number of states is `N`. Each state has 2 transitions. So complexity is `O(N log N)`.\n\nAfter computing `min_bound[k]` for `k <= N`:\nFor `k > N`, if `k` is reachable, then `min_bound[k]` will be `k`.\nWhy? Suppose `k > N` and `min_bound[k] < k`. This would mean `k` is reachable, and the path to `k` never went above some `X < k`.\nBut if `k` is reachable, and `k > N`, then `k-b` is reachable and `k-b >= 0`.\nIf `min_bound[k-b]` is `k-b`, and `k-b` is sufficiently large, then `min_bound[k]` would be `max(min_bound[k-b], k)` or `max(min_bound[k-b], k-b)`.\nThe actual threshold for `min_bound[k]=k` for reachable `k` is `max(a,b)`.\nLet `L = max(a,b)`. For `k > L`, if `k` is reachable, then `min_bound[k] = k`.\nThis is because any path to `k` must eventually involve a `+a` jump to reach `k`. If `k` is the highest point on its path, then `min_bound[k]=k`. If some `k'>k` was the highest point, then `min_bound[k]=min_bound[k']`. But then `k'` must be reachable.\nThe argument is: if `k > max(a,b)` is reachable, then `k-b` is reachable and `k-b >= 0`. If `k-b` is also `> max(a,b)`, this continues. Eventually, we reach a `k_0 <= max(a,b)`.\nA safe threshold for `min_bound[k]=k` is `max(a,b) + a`.\nLet `T = a + b`. We compute `min_bound[k]` for `k` up to `T`.\nFor `k > T`, if `k` is reachable, `min_bound[k] = k`.\nThis is because if `k` is reachable and `k > T`, then `k-b >= a`. Any path to `k` must have `k` as its maximum value, or some `k' > k`. If `k` is the maximum, `min_bound[k] = k`. If `k'` is the maximum, then `min_bound[k] = min_bound[k']`.\nThe largest `min_bound[k]` that is less than `k` must occur for `k <= T`.\nLet `MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA = max(a,b) + a`. A safer bound is `2*a + b`. Let's use `MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA = 2 * (a+b)`.\nLet `limit_k = min(m, MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA)`. We run Dijkstra for `k` up to `limit_k`.\n\nAfter computing `min_bound[k]` for `k` in `[0, limit_k]`:\nThe total sum is `sum(f(i) for i in range(m+1))`.\n`f(i) = count(k <= i and min_bound[k] <= i)`.\nLet `reachable_pts = [k for k in range(limit_k + 1) if min_bound[k] != float('inf')]`.\nSort `reachable_pts` by `min_bound[k]`.\n`min_bound_pairs = sorted([(min_bound[k], k) for k in reachable_pts])`.\n\nWe can iterate through `i` from `0` to `m`.\nFor `i <= limit_k`:\n  `f(i)` is `count(k <= i and min_bound[k] <= i)`. This can be computed by iterating `k` from `0` to `i`.\n  `current_sum += f(i)`.\nFor `i > limit_k`:\n  `f(i) = count(k <= limit_k and min_bound[k] <= i) + count(k in (limit_k, i] and min_bound[k] <= i)`.\n  For `k > limit_k`, `min_bound[k]` will be `k` (if `k` is reachable).\n  So `f(i) = count(k <= limit_k and min_bound[k] <= i) + count(k in (limit_k, i] and k is reachable)`.\n  The second term is `count(k in (limit_k, i] and k % g == 0)`.\n  This is `(floor(i/g) - floor(limit_k/g))`.\n\nLet `P_i = {k | k <= i, min_bound[k] <= i}`. `f(i) = |P_i|`.\nThe sum `S = sum_{i=0}^m f(i) = sum_{i=0}^m sum_{k=0}^i [min_bound[k] <= i]`.\nWe can swap the summations: `S = sum_{k=0}^m sum_{i=k}^m [min_bound[k] <= i]`.\nFor a fixed `k`, `min_bound[k]` is a constant. Let `X_k = min_bound[k]`.\nWe need to sum `[X_k <= i]` for `i` from `k` to `m`.\nThis is equivalent to counting `i` such that `max(k, X_k) <= i <= m`.\nThe number of such `i` is `m - max(k, X_k) + 1`.\nSo `S = sum_{k=0}^m (m - max(k, X_k) + 1)`.\nWe only need to consider `k` such that `X_k != infinity`.\n\nThe reachable points `k` for which `min_bound[k]` is finite:\n1. `k <= limit_k`: We have `min_bound[k]` from Dijkstra.\n2. `k > limit_k`: If `k` is a multiple of `g` and `k > limit_k`, then `min_bound[k] = k`.\n   (This is true because `limit_k` is chosen large enough so that any `k > limit_k` that is reachable must have `min_bound[k]=k`. This is a standard result in problems like this, where `a` and `b` are fixed increments/decrements.)\n\nSo, the sum `S` becomes:\n`S = sum_{k=0}^{limit_k} (m - max(k, min_bound[k]) + 1)` (if `min_bound[k]` is finite)\n  `+ sum_{k=limit_k+1}^m (m - max(k, k) + 1)` (if `k % g == 0`)\n  `= sum_{k=0}^{limit_k} (m - max(k, min_bound[k]) + 1)` (if `min_bound[k]` is finite)\n  `+ sum_{k=limit_k+1, k%g==0}^m (m - k + 1)`.\n\nThe second sum: `sum_{k=limit_k+1, k%g==0}^m (m - k + 1)`.\nLet `k = j*g`.\n`sum_{j*g > limit_k, j*g <= m} (m - j*g + 1)`.\nThis is an arithmetic progression.\nLet `j_start = floor(limit_k / g) + 1`.\nLet `j_end = floor(m / g)`.\nThe sum is `sum_{j=j_start}^{j_end} (m - j*g + 1)`.\nThis can be calculated using sum formulas: `sum(C - j*g)` is `C * (count) - g * sum(j)`.\n`count = j_end - j_start + 1`.\n`sum(j) = (j_start + j_end) * count / 2`.\nThis part can be computed in `O(1)`.\n\nThe first sum: `sum_{k=0}^{limit_k} (m - max(k, min_bound[k]) + 1)`.\nIterate `k` from `0` to `limit_k`. If `min_bound[k]` is finite, add `m - max(k, min_bound[k]) + 1` to total.\nThis takes `O(limit_k)` time.\n\nTotal time complexity: `O(MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA * log(MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA))`.\n`MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA` is `2*(a+b)`. `a,b <= 10^5`. So `MAX_K_FOR_DIJKSTRA` is about `4*10^5`.\n`4*10^5 * log(4*10^5)` is roughly `4*10^5 * 19`, which is about `7.6 * 10^6`. This is efficient enough.\n\nEdge cases:\n- `a=1, b=2019, m=10^9`. `g=1`.\n  `limit_k = min(10^9, 2*(1+2019)) = min(10^9, 4040) = 4040`.\n  Dijkstra will run up to `k=4040`.\n  `min_bound[k]` will be `k` for all `k` in `[0, 4040]` (since `a=1`).\n  First sum: `sum_{k=0}^{4040} (m - max(k, k) + 1) = sum_{k=0}^{4040} (m - k + 1)`.\n  Second sum: `sum_{k=4041, k%1==0}^{m} (m - k + 1)`.\n  This simplifies to `sum_{k=0}^{m} (m - k + 1)`.\n  This is `(m+1) + m + ... + 1 = (m+1)(m+2)/2`.\n  For `m=10^9`, this is `(10^9+1)(10^9+2)/2`.\n  Example output: `500000001500000001`.\n  `(10^9+1)(10^9+2)/2 = (10^{18} + 3*10^9 + 2)/2 = 0.5*10^{18} + 1.5*10^9 + 1`.\n  `500000000000000000 + 1500000000 + 1 = 501500000001`.\n  Wait, `(10^9+1)(10^9+2)/2`.\n  `10^9+1 = 1000000001`.\n  `10^9+2 = 1000000002`.\n  `1000000001 * 1000000002 / 2 = 1000000001 * 500000001 = 500000001500000001`. Correct.\n\n- `m=100, a=100000, b=1`.\n  `g=1`. `limit_k = min(100, 2*(100000+1)) = 100`.\n  Dijkstra runs for `k` up to `100`.\n  `min_bound[0]=0`.\n  From `0`, only `0+a` is possible. `0+100000 = 100000`.

Using `2*(a+b)` is even safer and not much slower.\nThe number of distinct reachable points up to `a+b` is at most `a+b`.\nThe `min_bound` array size should be `min(m, 2*(a+b)) + 1`.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    # limit_k is the maximum k for which we explicitly compute min_bound[k]\n    # For k > limit_k, if k is reachable, min_bound[k] = k\n    # A safe upper bound for limit_k is 2 * (a + b)\n    # But it must not exceed m\n    limit_k = min(m, 2 * (a + b)) \n\n    # min_bound[k] stores the minimum X such that k is reachable and all intermediate jumps are in [0, X]\n    # Initialize with infinity\n    min_bound = [float('inf')] * (limit_k + 1)\n    \n    # Priority queue for Dijkstra: (current_X, current_k)\n    pq = [(0, 0)]\n    min_bound[0] = 0\n\n    while pq:\n        current_X, current_k = heapq.heappop(pq)\n\n        if current_X > min_bound[current_k]:\n            continue\n\n        # Option 1: Jump +a\n        next_k_plus_a = current_k + a\n        if next_k_plus_a <= limit_k:\n            next_X_plus_a = max(current_X, next_k_plus_a)\n            if next_X_plus_a < min_bound[next_k_plus_a]:\n                min_bound[next_k_plus_a] = next_X_plus_a\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (next_X_plus_a, next_k_plus_a))\n        # If next_k_plus_a > limit_k, we don't need to update min_bound for it.\n        # For such k, min_bound[k] = k if reachable.\n\n        # Option 2: Jump -b\n        next_k_minus_b = current_k - b\n        if next_k_minus_b >= 0:\n            next_X_minus_b = current_X # Max X doesn't change when jumping down\n            if next_X_minus_b < min_bound[next_k_minus_b]:\n                min_bound[next_k_minus_b] = next_X_minus_b\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (next_X_minus_b, next_k_minus_b))\n    \n    total_sum_f_i = 0\n\n    # Part 1: k from 0 to limit_k\n    for k in range(limit_k + 1):\n        if min_bound[k] != float('inf'):\n            # For this k, it is reachable.\n            # We need to add (m - max(k, min_bound[k]) + 1) to the total sum.\n            # This counts how many f(i) (for i from k to m) include k.\n            # k is included in f(i) if i >= k and i >= min_bound[k].\n            # So i must be >= max(k, min_bound[k]).\n            # The number of such i's is m - max(k, min_bound[k]) + 1.\n            total_sum_f_i += (m - max(k, min_bound[k]) + 1)\n\n    # Part 2: k from limit_k + 1 to m\n    # For k > limit_k, if k is reachable, min_bound[k] = k.\n    # A point k is reachable if k % g == 0.\n    # We need to sum (m - max(k, k) + 1) = (m - k + 1) for these k.\n    # k must be a multiple of g.\n    \n    # Find the first multiple of g greater than limit_k\n    start_k = (limit_k // g + 1) * g\n    \n    # If start_k is already greater than m, there are no such k\n    if start_k <= m:\n        # Sum (m - k + 1) for k = start_k, start_k+g, ..., m (multiples of g)\n        # Let k = j*g.
