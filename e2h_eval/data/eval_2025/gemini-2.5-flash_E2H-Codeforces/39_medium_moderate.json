Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Competitive Programming Problem**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of this problem is finding a way to arrange numbers on an N x N board so that a rook takes more steps than the queen to visit all the cells. The rook moves horizontally and vertically, the queen in all directions, and the rule is to teleport if the current piece can't access any unvisited cell. My goal is to get the rook to pay fewer vuns than the queen.\n\nThe queen has an advantage because it can reach more cells, which should make the queen pay fewer vuns. The initial idea is to create a situation where the queen exhausts its options early (pays vuns), while the rook still has reachable cells. This implies the numbering must strategically \"funnel\" the queen towards cells where it's more likely to get blocked.\n\nI started exploring small examples, like N=2, to identify any patterns. It became apparent that constructing a board where the rook pays fewer vuns than the queen is difficult. Since the queen has the bigger range, it's generally more efficient and thus will, if anything, pay no more and often fewer vuns than the rook.\n\nThe key insight is that if the queen has to pay a vun, the rook, at the same step, *could* pay as well, due to the queen's broader reach, meaning the queen is less likely to pay a vun. So, I need to focus on scenarios where the queen pays and the rook doesn't. This can happen if, at a given step, the queen's range only accesses visited cells, while the rook's range still has an unvisited cell.\n\nSo, for a viable construction, I need the queen to be forced to access cells that are \"difficult\" for the rook. The queen should go to the critical areas, leaving the rook with a more straightforward path. To illustrate this, I'm working through a 4x4 board example to develop intuition, trying to construct an order for the cells that gives the right result.",
    "response": "The problem asks us to construct an $N \\times N$ board with numbers from $1$ to $N^2$ such that a rook pays strictly less vuns than a queen. If no such board exists, we should print -1.\n\nLet's understand the rules for paying vuns:\n1. A piece starts at cell `1`. This cell is visited.\n2. At each step, the piece looks for unvisited cells it can reach in one move.\n3. If there are such cells, it moves to the one with the minimal number. No vun is paid.\n4. If all accessible cells are already visited, but there are still unvisited cells on the board, the piece teleports to the unvisited cell with the minimal number. 1 vun is paid.\n5. The process stops when all cells are visited.\n\nThe key observation is how a piece pays a vun. A vun is paid when all cells reachable from the current position are already visited.\nA queen can reach any cell a rook can (horizontally, vertically) plus diagonal cells. This means the set of cells reachable by a queen from any position is always a superset of cells reachable by a rook from the same position.\nLet $S_R(pos)$ be the set of cells reachable by a rook from $pos$, and $S_Q(pos)$ be the set for a queen. We have $S_R(pos) \\subseteq S_Q(pos)$.\n\nIf the queen is at $Q_{curr}$ and all cells in $S_Q(Q_{curr})$ are visited, then all cells in $S_R(Q_{curr})$ must also be visited. This implies that if the queen pays a vun at a certain step (from $Q_{curr}$), a rook at the *same position* $Q_{curr}$ with the *same set of visited cells* would also pay a vun.\n\nHowever, the rook and queen follow different paths, so their current positions and sets of visited cells will diverge. To achieve `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`, we need a scenario where the queen pays a vun, but the rook does not. This can only happen if:\n- At some point, the queen is at $Q_{curr}$ and all cells in $S_Q(Q_{curr})$ are visited (so queen pays a vun).\n- At the same step, the rook is at $R_{curr}$ and there is at least one unvisited cell in $S_R(R_{curr})$ (so rook does not pay a vun).\n\nThis implies we need to construct a board where the queen gets \"stuck\" more often than the rook. Since the queen has more mobility, this is counter-intuitive. It means the queen must visit cells in a way that exhausts its local options more quickly.\n\nThe problem statement provides an example for $N=4$ where rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns. This confirms that such a scenario is possible. Let's analyze the example output for $N=4$:\n```\n4  3  6 12\n7  5  9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16  2\n```\nThe numbers are arranged in a specific pattern. Notice that small numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) are scattered.\nLet's try to generalize this pattern.\nThe example board has $1$ at $(2,1)$ (0-indexed).\n$2$ at $(3,3)$.\n$3$ at $(0,1)$.\n$4$ at $(0,0)$.\n\nThe key insight from the example seems to be placing numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, N^2$ in a way that forces the queen to \"waste\" its superior movement.\nConsider placing small numbers in two separate \"halves\" of the board.\nFor example, fill the first $N \\times N / 2$ cells with smaller numbers and the remaining cells with larger numbers.\nLet's divide the $N \\times N$ board into two parts. For example, assign numbers $1, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ to certain cells and $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\ldots, N^2$ to the remaining cells.\nIf we place all small numbers in a way that queen can reach them easily, it will consume many cells. The rook might be forced to teleport less if its path is kept open.\n\nLet's try a simpler strategy:\nPlace numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, N^2/2$ (approximately) in one half of the board cells, and $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ in the other half.\nFor instance, fill cells $(r,c)$ where $r+c$ is even with small numbers, and cells where $r+c$ is odd with large numbers, or vice versa. This is a checkerboard pattern.\nA rook always stays on cells of the same color (parity of $r+c$) if it moves one step. To change color, it must move two steps.\nA queen can change color in one diagonal move.\n\nThis checkerboard idea seems promising. Let's try filling cells $(r,c)$ with $r+c$ even with numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ and cells $(r,c)$ with $r+c$ odd with numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nOr, more simply, fill cells with $r+c$ even with numbers $1, 3, 5, \\ldots$ and cells with $r+c$ odd with $2, 4, 6, \\ldots$. This is a standard way to get a knight to visit all cells without teleporting.\n\nLet's try to fill the board by alternating numbers:\nAssign $1, 3, 5, \\ldots$ to cells $(r,c)$ where $r+c$ is even.\nAssign $2, 4, 6, \\ldots$ to cells $(r,c)$ where $r+c$ is odd.\nLet's call the cells with $r+c$ even \"white\" and $r+c$ odd \"black\".\nThe number of white cells is $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$. The number of black cells is $\\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor$.\nWe can fill the white cells with $1, 2, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ and black cells with $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nThis ensures that the smallest numbers are all on one \"color\" of cells.\n\nLet's try this strategy:\n1. Create an $N \\times N$ board.\n2. Initialize `current_small = 1`, `current_large = N*N`.\n3. Iterate through the board cells (e.g., row by row, column by column).\n4. For each cell `(r, c)`:\n   If `(r+c)` is even, assign `board[r][c] = current_small`, then `current_small++`.\n   If `(r+c)` is odd, assign `board[r][c] = current_large`, then `current_large--`.\n\nThis fills all \"white\" cells with numbers from $1$ up to $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$, and all \"black\" cells with numbers from $N^2$ down to $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1$.\nThe smallest numbers are all on cells of the same parity for $r+c$.\nLet's assume `1` is on a white cell (i.e., its $r+c$ is even).\nThe rook starts at `1`.\nFrom a white cell, a rook can only move to other white cells (by moving two steps in one direction, e.g., (r,c) -> (r, c+2), or (r,c) -> (r+1, c+1) is a diagonal move, not rook move). No, a rook moves from $(r,c)$ to $(r, c')$ or $(r', c)$.\nIf $r+c$ is even, then $r+c'$ must be even or $r'+c$ must be even.\nIf $r+c$ is even, then $c'$ must have the same parity as $c$ for $r+c'$ to be even.\nIf $r+c$ is even, then $r'$ must have the same parity as $r$ for $r'+c$ to be even.\nThis means a rook always moves between cells of alternating parity for $r+c$.\nExample: $(0,0)$ (even) -> $(0,1)$ (odd) -> $(0,2)$ (even).\nSo, if `1` is at `(0,0)` (even $r+c$), the rook will always move to an odd $r+c$ cell next, then an even $r+c$ cell, and so on.\n\nThis means the rook will alternate between small numbers (on even $r+c$ cells) and large numbers (on odd $r+c$ cells).\nThe queen, however, can move diagonally. So from an even $r+c$ cell, it can move to an odd $r+c$ cell (rook move) or another even $r+c$ cell (diagonal move, e.g., $(0,0) \\to (1,1)$).\n\nLet's refine the filling strategy:\nFill cells $(r,c)$ with $r+c$ even with numbers $1, 2, \\dots, K$.\nFill cells $(r,c)$ with $r+c$ odd with numbers $K+1, \\dots, N^2$.\nHere $K$ is the count of cells with $r+c$ even. $K = \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$.\nLet's call the cells with $r+c$ even \"type A\" and $r+c$ odd \"type B\".\nThe numbers $1, \\ldots, K$ are in type A cells.\nThe numbers $K+1, \\ldots, N^2$ are in type B cells.\n\nConsider the path of the rook:\nStart at `1` (type A cell).\nFrom a type A cell, a rook can only reach type B cells.\nSo, the rook's path will be `1 (A) -> smallest_B -> smallest_A -> smallest_B -> ...`.\nThe rook will always pick the smallest available number.\nInitially, it will pick `1`.\nNext, it will pick the smallest number among reachable cells. All reachable cells are type B, so it picks `K+1` (assuming `K+1` is reachable).\nAfter that, from a type B cell, it will pick the smallest number among reachable cells. These are type A. It will pick `2` (assuming `2` is reachable).\nSo the rook path will try to alternate between `1, K+1, 2, K+2, 3, K+3, ...`\n\nConsider the path of the queen:\nStart at `1` (type A cell).\nFrom a type A cell, a queen can reach type B cells (horizontal/vertical moves) AND type A cells (diagonal moves).\nSo the queen has more options to find small numbers. It can pick `1`, then `2`, then `3`, etc., as long as they are reachable, even if they are all type A cells.\nThe queen will exhaust the small numbers more quickly.\n\nLet's test this for $N=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n$N=1$: Board `[1]`. Rook vuns = 0, Queen vuns = 0. Output -1. Our strategy: `(0,0)` is even. `board[0][0] = 1`. Same result. So $N=1$ should be -1.\n\n$N=2$: $N^2=4$. $K=\\lceil 4/2 \\rceil = 2$.\nType A cells: $(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)$. Oh, $N=2$.\nType A cells: $(0,0), (1,1)$.\nType B cells: $(0,1), (1,0)$.\nFill $(0,0)$ with $1$, $(1,1)$ with $2$.\nFill $(0,1)$ with $4$, $(1,0)$ with $3$.

Maybe solutions only exist for $N \\ge 4$?\nThe sample output for $N=4$ is:\n```\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n```\nThis is a specific construction.\n`1` is at `(2,1)`.\n`2` is at `(3,3)`.\n`3` is at `(0,1)`.\n`4` is at `(0,0)`.\n`5` is at `(1,1)`.\n`6` is at `(0,2)`.\n`7` is at `(1,0)`.\n`8` is at `(3,1)`.\n`9` is at `(1,2)`.\n`10` is at `(2,3)`.\n`11` is at `(2,2)`.\n`12` is at `(0,3)`.\n`13` is at `(3,0)`.\n`14` is at `(2,0)`.\n`15` is at `(1,3)`.\n`16` is at `(3,2)`.\n\nLet's categorize cells based on $r+c$ parity:\nEven $r+c$: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)\nOdd $r+c$: (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)\nThere are 8 cells of each type for $N=4$.\nNumbers $1, \\ldots, 16$.\nCells with small numbers:\n1 (2,1) - odd\n2 (3,3) - even\n3 (0,1) - odd\n4 (0,0) - even\n5 (1,1) - even\n6 (0,2) - even\n7 (1,0) - odd\n8 (3,1) - odd\n9 (1,2) - odd\n10 (2,3) - odd\n11 (2,2) - even\n12 (0,3) - odd\n13 (3,0) - odd\n14 (2,0) - even\n15 (1,3) - even\n16 (3,2) - even\n\nThis board does not strictly follow the checkerboard pattern of small numbers on one type of cell.\nHowever, it seems to put numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ on cells that are \"hard\" for the rook to reach without teleporting, while queen can reach them.\nOr, place numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ in a way that the queen visits them and gets \"stuck\", while the rook can still find unvisited cells.\n\nThe example shows that $N=4$ has a solution.\nWhat if $N=2,3$ do not have a solution?\nFor $N=1$, it's impossible.\nFor $N=2$, $N^2=4$.\nRook moves from $(r,c)$ to $(r, c')$ or $(r', c)$.\nQueen moves from $(r,c)$ to $(r, c')$, $(r', c)$, $(r \\pm k, c \\pm k)$.\nConsider $N=2$. Board:\n`A B`\n`C D`\nNumbers 1,2,3,4.\nIf 1 is at A.\nRook options: B, C. Queen options: B, C, D.\nQueen always has more options.\nSuppose the queen pays a vun. This means from its current cell $Q_{curr}$, all cells in $S_Q(Q_{curr})$ are visited.\nFor $N=2$, if $Q_{curr}=(0,0)$, $S_Q(0,0) = \\{(0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\\}$. If all these are visited, then all cells are visited, and the process stops.\nSo for $N=2$, no vuns are paid by either piece. Both will always find an unvisited cell among their reachable cells until all cells are visited.\nProof for $N=2$:\nThere are 4 cells.\n1. Start at `1`. 3 cells unvisited.\n2. From `1`, piece moves to `x`. 2 cells unvisited.\n3. From `x`, piece moves to `y`. 1 cell unvisited.\n4. From `y`, piece moves to `z`. 0 cells unvisited. Stop.\nAt each step, the piece is at some cell. The max number of reachable cells is 3 (for a corner for queen).\nIf 3 cells are unvisited, can it be that all reachable cells are visited? No, because only 1 cell is visited.\nIf 2 cells are unvisited, can it be that all reachable cells are visited? No.\nIf 1 cell is unvisited, can it be that all reachable cells are visited? No, the piece can always move to that last unvisited cell.\nSo for $N=2$, no vuns are ever paid. `vuns_rook = 0`, `vuns_queen = 0`. Thus, $N=2$ must be -1.\n\nWhat about $N=3$? $N^2=9$.\nA piece pays a vun if it's at $curr$ and $S_{piece}(curr) \\cap U = \\emptyset$.\nThe maximum number of cells reachable by a queen from a cell $(r,c)$ is $2(N-1)$ (row/col) + $2 \\min(r,c) + 2 \\min(N-1-r, N-1-c) + 2 \\min(r, N-1-c) + 2 \\min(N-1-r, c)$.\nFor $N=3$, max reachable cells for queen is from $(1,1)$ (center): $2(2) + 4 = 8$.\nFor $N=3$, max reachable cells for rook is from $(1,1)$ (center): $2(2) + 2(2) = 4$.\n\nIf $N=3$, and a piece is at $(1,1)$, there are 8 reachable cells for queen. If all 8 are visited, then all cells except $(1,1)$ are visited. So the process stops.\nIf a piece is at a corner $(0,0)$, queen can reach 5 cells. Rook can reach 4 cells.\nIf the queen pays a vun, it means all cells reachable from $Q_{curr}$ are visited.\nSuppose $Q_{curr}=(0,0)$. $S_Q(0,0)$ has 5 cells. If these 5 are visited, and $Q_{curr}$ is visited, then $1+5=6$ cells are visited. 3 cells are unvisited.\nThese 3 unvisited cells must not be reachable from $Q_{curr}$.\nFor $N=3$, from $(0,0)$, queen can reach $(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)$.\nThe unvisited cells must be $(1,2), (2,1), (2,2)$.\nIf the queen is at $(0,0)$, and $(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)$ are all visited, then the queen pays a vun. It would then teleport to the minimum of $(1,2), (2,1), (2,2)$.\n\nThis seems possible. Let's try to construct such a scenario for $N=3$.\nBoard:\n`1 2 3`\n`4 5 6`\n`7 8 9`\nRook vuns = 0, Queen vuns = 0.\n\nThe example solution for $N=4$ has $1$ and $2$ far apart.\n`1` at `(2,1)`. `2` at `(3,3)`.\nThis makes the queen's path: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2`. This path consumes `1,3,4,2`.\nRook's path: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6`. This path consumes `1,3,4,6`.\nThe queen takes `2` early. The rook takes `6` early.\nThis means queen has visited `2` but rook has not.\nAnd rook has visited `6` but queen has not.\n\nThis suggests a general strategy:\n1. Place `1` in a central location, e.g., `(N/2, N/2)` or `(N/2, N/2-1)`.\n2. Place `2` far away, e.g., `(N-1, N-1)`.\n3. Try to fill the remaining cells such that numbers $3, \\ldots, N^2/2$ are placed in a way that the queen picks them up more eagerly than the rook.\n\nA simpler strategy could be to place numbers $1, \\dots, \\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor$ in one set of cells, and $\\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor+1, \\dots, N^2$ in another set of cells.\nThe example output for $N=4$ places $1, \\dots, 8$ and $9, \\dots, 16$.\nCells with numbers $1, \\dots, 8$:\n(0,0) 4\n(0,1) 3\n(1,0) 7\n(1,1) 5\n(2,1) 1\n(3,0) 13\n(3,1) 8\n(3,3) 2\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are not contiguous or in a simple pattern.\n\nLet's look at the example's $N=4$ solution again.\nThe numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ are placed such that they are mostly in the \"inner\" part of the board, while $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ are in the \"outer\" part.\nThis is not strictly true either. $2$ is at $(3,3)$ (corner). $12$ is at $(0,3)$ (corner).\n\nThe crucial part is to make the queen pay a vun when the rook does not.\nThis means the rook must have an unvisited cell in its reachable set, while the queen does not.\nThis is only possible if the queen's path somehow visited all cells in its reachable set, but not all cells in the rook's reachable set.\nThis implies `S_rook(R_curr) \\cap U_rook` is non-empty, but `S_queen(Q_curr) \\cap U_queen` is empty.\n\nThis problem is a construction problem. The example for $N=4$ implies that for $N \\ge 4$, a solution might exist.\nWhat if $N=2,3$ are indeed impossible? The problem says \"print -1 if no solution\".\nMy analysis for $N=2$ suggests 0 vuns for both, so $N=2$ is -1.\nMy analysis for $N=3$ with checkerboard also suggests 0 vuns for both.\nCould it be that for $N=2,3$, no solution exists?\nIf $N=2$, the pieces always visit all 4 cells without teleporting.\nIf $N=3$, the pieces always visit all 9 cells without teleporting.\nLet's try to prove this for $N=3$.\nFrom any cell, a queen can reach at least 3 cells (e.g., from (0,0), it can reach (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)).\nIf there are $k$ unvisited cells, and $k \\ge 3$, the queen can always find an unvisited cell.\nIf $k=1$, the queen moves to that cell.\nIf $k=2$, say $U=\\{u_1, u_2\\}$. If $u_1$ is reachable, queen moves to $u_1$. If $u_2$ is reachable, queen moves to $u_2$.\nIf neither $u_1$ nor $u_2$ is reachable, then queen pays a vun. This means $S_Q(Q_{curr})$ is empty.\nThis means $Q_{curr}$ is completely surrounded by visited cells.\nFor $N=3$, if $Q_{curr}$ is $(0,0)$, $S_Q(0,0)$ has 5 cells. If all 5 are visited, and $Q_{curr}$ is visited, then 6 cells are visited. $U$ has $9-6=3$ cells.\nSo if $N=3$, the queen will never pay a vun until the last step.\nIf $N=3$, Queen never pays a vun. Thus, rook cannot pay strictly less. So $N=3$ must be -1.\n\nSo, the solutions are for $N \\ge 4$.\nThe example $N=4$ is a solution.\nWe need a general construction for $N \\ge 4$.\n\nLet's try to make the rook pay 1 vun and the queen pay 2 vuns.\nThis means the queen must get \"stuck\" twice, and the rook only once.\n\nConsider this strategy for $N \\ge 4$:\nFill the top-left $(N/2) \\times N$ rectangle with numbers $1, \\ldots, N \\cdot N/2$.\nFill the bottom-right $N \\times N/2$ rectangle with numbers $N \\cdot N/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nThis is not good.\n\nLet's try to make the rook's path as \"straight\" as possible using small numbers, while the queen's path is forced to \"zig-zag\" and consume many cells.\nPlace numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ on the \"even\" diagonal cells (e.g., $(r,c)$ where $r+c$ is even), and $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ on \"odd\" diagonal cells.\nThis is the checkerboard pattern. We showed it doesn't work for $N=2,3$. What about $N \\ge 4$?\n\nLet's use the checkerboard pattern:\nBoard `ans[N][N]`.\n`small_num = 1`\n`large_num = N*N`\nIterate `r` from `0` to `N-1`.\n  Iterate `c` from `0` to `N-1`.\n    If `(r+c)` is even: `ans[r][c] = small_num`, `small_num++`.\n    Else (`(r+c)` is odd): `ans[r][c] = large_num`, `large_num--`.\n\nLet's re-run the $N=4$ example with this pattern:\n$N^2=16$. $K=\\lceil 16/2 \\rceil = 8$.\nType A (even $r+c$): $(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)$. (8 cells)\nType B (odd $r+c$): $(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)$. (8 cells)\nNumbers $1, \\ldots, 8$ go to Type A. Numbers $16, \\ldots, 9$ go to Type B.\nBoard (filling row by row):\n`1 16 2 15`\n`14 3 13 4`\n`5 12 6 11`\n`10 7 9 8`\n\nRook:\n1. Start at `(0,0)` (value 1). Visited = {1}.\n2.

Queen vuns = 0.\n\nThis checkerboard pattern doesn't work for $N=4$ either to produce different vuns. It seems both pieces always exhaust their options fully before needing to teleport.\n\nThe problem example is very specific. It suggests that there might not be a simple general pattern like checkerboard.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is likely a manually crafted solution.\nIf $N=1,2,3$ are impossible, and $N=4$ has a solution, the problem is asking for a general solution for $N \\ge 4$.\nThe example output is:\n```\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n```\nThis is a specific construction. Let's try to understand its structure.\nThe numbers $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$ are placed in cells:\n`1 @ (2,1)`\n`2 @ (3,3)`\n`3 @ (0,1)`\n`4 @ (0,0)`\n`5 @ (1,1)`\n`6 @ (0,2)`\n`7 @ (1,0)`\n`8 @ (3,1)`\n\nThe general solution for $N \\ge 4$:\nWe can construct a board such that the rook pays 1 vun and the queen pays 2 vuns.\nThis can be achieved by placing the smallest numbers in a way that:\n1. The queen is forced to visit many cells, including some that are crucial for the rook's connectivity.\n2. The rook's path is kept somewhat \"open\" to small numbers.\n\nLet's try to achieve 1 vun for rook and 2 vuns for queen for $N \\ge 4$.\nThe simplest way to achieve this for $N \\ge 4$ is to replicate the structure of the $N=4$ example in some way, or use a similar idea.\n\nThe sample output for $N=4$ has $1$ near the center. What if we always place $1$ at $(N/2, N/2)$?\nLet's try to fill the board by alternating numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ and $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nThe crucial part is that the queen's path has to diverge from the rook's path such that it visits cells that lead to it getting stuck.\n\nWhat if we fill the top half of the board with small numbers and bottom half with large numbers?\n`1 2 3 4`\n`5 6 7 8`\n`16 15 14 13`\n`12 11 10 9`\nThis is $N=4$.\nRook from `(0,0)`: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`.

Queen vuns = 0.\n\nThis problem is harder than it looks if a simple pattern doesn't work.\nThe example solution for $N=4$ is likely a specific construction that leverages the difference in movement.\nFor $N \\ge 4$, we can use a strategy that makes the queen visit many cells quickly, including some that are vital for the rook's movement.\n\nLet's use the given example for $N=4$ as the base case.\nFor $N > 4$:\nWe need to ensure that the rook pays 1 vun and the queen pays 2 vuns.\nA possible general construction for $N \\ge 4$:\nFill the board in a specific pattern.\nPlace numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ in the cells $(r,c)$ where $r$ is even.\nPlace numbers $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ in the cells $(r,c)$ where $r$ is odd.\nThis is a row-wise checkerboard.\nLet's try this for $N=4$:\nNumbers $1, \\ldots, 8$ go to rows 0, 2.

Queen vuns = 0.\n\nIt seems that for $N \\ge 2$, neither the simple checkerboard pattern nor the row-wise checkerboard pattern works to produce vuns for either piece. This implies that the pieces are always able to find an unvisited cell in their reachable set. This would mean $N=2,3$ and any $N$ with these patterns yield 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe problem specifically states $N=1$ is -1.\nMy analysis for $N=2,3$ suggests they are also -1.\nThe sample output for $N=4$ is a specific construction.\nThis means my general pattern finding is flawed, or the problem requires a specific construction for $N=4$ and then some other pattern for $N > 4$.\n\nThe problem asks for *any* solution.\nIf $N=1,2,3$, print -1.\nFor $N \\ge 4$, we can use the pattern from the example.\nHow to generalize the example?\nThe example shows a rather complex arrangement.\nThe numbers $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$ are placed in cells:\n`4 3 6 .`\n`7 5 9 .`\n`14 1 11 .`\n`13 8 16 2`\nThe pattern looks like a spiral or some kind of path that fills the board.\nLet's analyze the example $N=4$ board carefully.\nSmall numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ are scattered. Large numbers $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ are also scattered.\nThe key might be to place $1$ and $2$ such that they are far apart, and the queen can reach $2$ faster (or at least earlier in its path) than the rook.\nIn the example:\n`1` is at `(2,1)`.\n`2` is at `(3,3)`.\nRook path: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2`. Rook reaches `2` as 9th cell.\nQueen path: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2`. Queen reaches `2` as 4th cell.\nThis is exactly what we need! Queen visits `2` much earlier.\nThis means the queen \"consumes\" a small number early, potentially leading to a situation where its local options are exhausted.\n\nLet's try to construct a similar pattern for $N \\ge 4$.\nPlace numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ in the top-left quadrant and $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ in the bottom-right quadrant.\nThis is also not the example.\n\nLet's try to make a board for $N \\ge 4$ that is essentially the $N=4$ example embedded, or a similar construction.\nThe example board for $N=4$:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet's try to fill the board with numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2$ in a specific pattern.\nFill the cells $(r,c)$ such that $r < N/2$ and $c < N/2$ (top-left) with $1, \\ldots, N^2/4$.\nThis is not going to be simple.\n\nA common competitive programming strategy for construction problems is to find a small $N$ that works, and then repeat or tile it.\nThe $N=4$ example is the smallest $N$ that works.\nFor $N > 4$, we can fill the board in a specific way.\nHow about filling the board such that:\nNumbers $1, \\ldots, \\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor$ are placed in cells $(r,c)$ where $r$ is even.\nNumbers $\\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor+1, \\ldots, N^2$ are placed in cells $(r,c)$ where $r$ is odd.\nThis is the row-wise checkerboard. I showed it doesn't work for $N=4$.\n\nThe problem has a small $N$ bound (500). This means an $O(N^2)$ or $O(N^2 \\log N)$ solution for construction is fine. Simulating the game would be $O(N^4)$ or $O(N^4 \\log N)$ which is too slow to verify.\n\nFinal strategy attempt:\nFor $N=1,2,3$: print -1.\nFor $N \\ge 4$:\nWe need a construction that ensures rook pays less than queen.\nLet's try a simple pattern that ensures small numbers are \"spread out\" for the queen.\nFill the board with numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2$ in a snake-like pattern.\nExample $N=4$:\n`1  2  3  4`\n`8  7  6  5`\n`9 10 11 12`\n`16 15 14 13`\nThis is a common way to fill a board.\nRook:\n`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`. Then to `(1,3)[5]`.\n`5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`. Then to `(2,0)[9]`.\n`9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12`. Then to `(3,3)[13]`.\n`13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16`.\nRook vuns = 0.\n\nQueen:\n`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`.\nFrom `(0,3)[4]`. Queen can reach `(1,2)[6]` or `(1,3)[5]`. Min is `5`.\n`4 -> 5`.\nFrom `(1,3)[5]`. Queen can reach `(0,2)[3]` (visited), `(1,2)[6]`, `(2,2)[11]`, `(2,3)[12]`. Min is `6`.\n`5 -> 6`.\nThis will also be 0 vuns for queen.\n\nThe only remaining option is to use the specific $N=4$ example and then for $N>4$ use a different pattern.\nWhat if we just fill the board in a simple way for $N > 4$?\nThe problem is tricky because the queen's superior movement usually means it finds small numbers more easily and is less likely to get stuck.\n\nPerhaps for $N \\ge 4$, we can use the pattern:\nFill the first $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ cells (e.g., in reading order) with $1, 2, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$.\nFill the remaining cells with $N^2, N^2-1, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1$.\nThis means the small numbers are clustered in the top-left.\nExample $N=4$: $K=8$.\n`1  2  3  4`\n`5  6  7  8`\n`16 15 14 13`\n`12 11 10 9`\nThis is the pattern I just tested, and it yields 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe actual solution for $N=4$ in the example is very specific.\nThe only way to guarantee `vuns_rook < vuns_queen` is to make the queen pay vuns while the rook doesn't.\nThis means the queen must be in a position where all its reachable cells are visited, but the rook (at its current position) still has reachable unvisited cells.\n\nThis problem is a known type of puzzle. For $N=1,2,3$, the answer is -1.\nFor $N \\ge 4$, a solution exists. The trick is to ensure the queen is forced to \"clear\" its neighbourhood of small numbers faster.\nA common strategy is to place numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, N^2/2$ in positions $(r,c)$ such that $r+c$ is even (or odd), and $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ in the other positions.\nThis is the checkerboard pattern. My tests showed it doesn't work for $N=2,3,4$.\nThis implies the specific example for $N=4$ is not using this simple checkerboard pattern.\n\nThe only way to solve this is to find a pattern that works for $N \\ge 4$.\nIf $N=1,2,3$ are -1, then for $N \\ge 4$, we need to output a board.\nLet's use a specific construction for $N \\ge 4$:\nFill cells $(r,c)$ where $r$ is even with values $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ (in reading order).\nFill cells $(r,c)$ where $r$ is odd with values $N^2, \\ldots, N^2/2+1$ (in reading order).\nThis is the row-wise fill I tested. I got 0 vuns for both.\nThis is not sufficient.\n\nThe example $N=4$ is the only working example. This suggests that the solution might not be a simple fill pattern.\nThe problem statement itself is \"Road to 1600\", implying it might be a specific trick.\n\nLet's consider the provided $N=4$ solution and just output it for $N=4$.\nFor $N > 4$, we need a different strategy.\nThe problem asks for ANY solution.\nWhat if we place the numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ in a \"sparse\" way?\nAnd $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ in a \"dense\" way.\n\nLet's try to fill the board by alternating small and large numbers in a specific way.\nFill the first $N/2$ rows with numbers $1, \\ldots, N \\cdot N/2$.\nFill the last $N/2$ rows with numbers $N \\cdot N/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nThis is the top-bottom split. I tested it for $N=4$, it gives 0 vuns.\n\nThe only construction that works is the one given in the example.\nWhat if we just print the $N=4$ example if $N=4$, and for $N>4$ print a similar structure?\nFor $N \\ge 4$:\nLet's try filling the board by alternating numbers in a specific way.\nUse $num1 = 1$ and $num2 = N^2$.\nIterate through the board cells `(r,c)`:\nIf `r` is even:\n  If `c` is even: `board[r][c] = num1`, `num1++`\n  Else (`c` is odd): `board[r][c] = num2`, `num2--`\nIf `r` is odd:\n  If `c` is even: `board[r][c] = num2`, `num2--`\n  Else (`c` is odd): `board[r][c] = num1`, `num1++`\n\nThis creates a pattern where numbers $1, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$ are on cells where $r$ and $c$ have the same parity.\nAnd numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\ldots, N^2$ are on cells where $r$ and $c$ have different parity.\nThis is a specific type of checkerboard.\nLet's try for $N=4$:\n`1 16 2 15`\n`12 3 11 4`\n`5 10 6 9`\n`8 7 14 13`\nThis is different from the previous checkerboard.\nThe previous checkerboard was $(r+c)$ parity. This one is $(r\\%2 == c\\%2)$ parity.\n\nLet's assume $N=1,2,3$ are -1.\nFor $N \\ge 4$, let's try to make a construction that ensures rook pays 1 and queen pays 2.\nThe specific construction from the example for $N=4$ is:\n```\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n```\nThis is the only known working example. I'll use this for $N=4$.\nFor $N > 4$, I will use the row-wise fill:\n`small_val = 1`\n`large_val = N*N`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  If `r` is even:\n    For `c` from `0` to `N-1`: `board[r][c] = small_val`, `small_val++`\n  Else (`r` is odd):\n    For `c` from `0` to `N-1`: `board[r][c] = large_val`, `large_val--`\nThis is what I called the top-bottom split. I previously tested it for $N=4$ and it resulted in 0 vuns for both.\nThis means this strategy is not working.\n\nThe problem is usually solvable with a general pattern.\nThe problem statement specifically says \"Help him to find such N x N board\", not just for N=4.\nThe only way the queen pays more vuns is if it gets stuck more often.\nThis could happen if the queen, having more options, clears out all cells around it faster than the rook.\n\nThe problem is harder than it looks. Given that $N=1,2,3$ are likely -1 and $N=4$ has a specific solution, a general construction for $N \\ge 4$ is required.\nThe example solution for $N=4$ is probably the intended solution for $N=4$.\nFor $N > 4$, a different strategy is needed.\n\nWhat if we try to place the numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2$ in a way that creates \"holes\" for the queen?\nA common pattern for such problems is to fill the cells $(r,c)$ with $r$ and $c$ both even, then $r$ even and $c$ odd, etc.\nThis is a specific variant of the checkerboard.\n\nLet's try the simple strategy of filling the first half of the cells with small numbers and the second half with large numbers, but in an alternating pattern.\nLet's try to fill the board in a way that the first half of the numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2$ are placed in cells $(r,c)$ where $r$ is even, and the second half of numbers are placed in cells where $r$ is odd.\n`small_num = 1`\n`large_num = N*N`\n`board = [[0]*N for _ in range(N)]`\n`even_rows = []`\n`odd_rows = []`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  If `r` is even:\n    For `c` from `0` to `N-1`: `even_rows.append((r,c))`\n  Else (`r` is odd):\n    For `c` from `0` to `N-1`: `odd_rows.append((r,c))`\n\nFor `(r,c)` in `even_rows`:\n  `board[r][c] = small_num`\n  `small_num++`\nFor `(r,c)` in `odd_rows`:\n  `board[r][c] = large_num`\n  `large_num--`\n\nThis ensures that all smallest numbers are in even rows, and largest numbers are in odd rows.\nThis is essentially my \"top-bottom split\" but with the filling order.\nLet's re-verify for $N=4$:\nEven rows (0,2) get $1, \\ldots, 8$. Odd rows (1,3) get $16, \\ldots, 9$.\n`1  2  3  4`\n`16 15 14 13`\n`5  6  7  8`\n`12 11 10 9`\nThis board was found to have 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe only remaining option is that $N=1,2,3$ are -1, and for $N \\ge 4$, the problem statement's example construction for $N=4$ is the general construction. This seems unlikely as it's not a simple pattern.\n\nLet's try to make the rook pay 1 vun and queen pay 2 vuns by placing $1, \\ldots, N^2$ in a specific pattern that forces this.\nThe solution must be a general pattern for $N \\ge 4$.\nThe example $N=4$ solution is:\n```\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n```\nThis is a \"spiral\" like pattern, but with numbers placed in a specific order.\nThe problem is hard because the queen is always more powerful.\nThe only way for the queen to pay more is if its path leads it to a dead end more often.\n\nLet's consider the number of cells. $N=1,2,3$ are -1.\nFor $N \\ge 4$:\nFill the first $N/2$ rows with numbers $1, \\ldots, N \\cdot N/2$ in a specific order.\nFill the remaining $N/2$ rows with $N \\cdot N/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ in a specific order.\n\nThe provided solution for $N=4$ is highly specific.\nThe only reasonable approach for competitive programming is to find a general pattern.\nThe pattern that works for $N \\ge 4$ is to fill the first $\\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor$ rows with small numbers and the remaining rows with large numbers.\nAnd then fill each row alternately from left to right and right to left.\nExample for $N=4$:\nRows $0,1$ get $1, \\ldots, 8$. Rows $2,3$ get $9, \\ldots, 16$.\n`1  2  3  4` (row 0, L-R)\n`8  7  6  5` (row 1, R-L)\n`9 10 11 12` (row 2, L-R)\n`16 15 14 13` (row 3, R-L)\nThis is the snake pattern. I already tested this and it gives 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe problem is quite tricky. The only way to get a solution is to find a specific construction that works.\nThe problem setter must have a specific construction in mind.\nGiven the constraints and problem type, it's likely a pattern like:\n1. Print -1 for $N=1,2,3$.\n2. For $N \\ge 4$, print a specific construction.\n\nThe specific construction for $N \\ge 4$:\nFill the board in two parts:\nPart 1: cells $(r,c)$ where $r+c$ is even. Fill with numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, \\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil$.\nPart 2: cells $(r,c)$ where $r+c$ is odd. Fill with numbers $\\lceil N^2/2 \\rceil+1, \\ldots, N^2$.\nThis is the checkerboard pattern.\nI tested it for $N=2,3,4$ and it resulted in 0 vuns for both. This means it's not the solution.\n\nThe only solution is to replicate the example for $N=4$ and hope it generalizes.\nThe example board for $N=4$ is:\n```\n4 3 6 12\n7 5 9 15\n14 1 11 10\n13 8 16 2\n```\nThis is a specific construction, not a simple pattern.\nThe problem setter must expect us to derive this pattern or a similar one.\nThe numbers $1, \\dots, N^2/2$ are assigned to cells in a specific order, and $N^2/2+1, \\dots, N^2$ are assigned to the remaining cells.\nThe pattern in the example is:\n`1` in cell `(2,1)`\n`2` in cell `(3,3)`\n`3` in cell `(0,1)`\n`4` in cell `(0,0)`\n`5` in cell `(1,1)`\n`6` in cell `(0,2)`\n`7` in cell `(1,0)`\n`8` in cell `(3,1)`\nThe remaining cells are filled with $9, \\ldots, 16$.\n\nThe core idea for $N \\ge 4$ must be to place $1$ and $2$ far apart, and make the queen pick $2$ early.\nA construction that works for $N \\ge 4$:\nPlace $1$ at $(N/2, N/2)$.\nPlace $2$ at $(N/2-1, N/2-1)$ (if $N/2-1 \\ge 0$).\nThis is getting too complex.\n\nFinal strategy:\nPrint -1 for $N=1,2,3$.\nFor $N \\ge 4$:\nPlace numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ in the top-left quadrant and $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ in the bottom-right quadrant.\nThis is not general.\n\nLet's use the pattern from the $N=4$ example.\nFor $N \\ge 4$:\nFill cells $(r, c)$ in reading order.\nAssign $1, \\dots, \\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor$ to cells $(r,c)$ where $r$ is even.\nAssign $\\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor+1, \\dots, N^2$ to cells $(r,c)$ where $r$ is odd.\nThis is the row-wise split. I've tested it and it gives 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe only way to proceed is to use the specific example for $N=4$ and then some other simple pattern for $N>4$.\nThe simplest pattern that could create vuns is to fill the board with numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2$ in a way that creates \"holes\" for the queen.\nThe example output for $N=4$ is the solution for $N=4$.\nFor $N > 4$, we can use a similar logic.\nThe numbers $1, \\ldots, N^2/2$ go to specific cells, and $N^2/2+1, \\ldots, N^2$ go to the rest.\nThe output format for $N=4$ looks like a pattern where numbers are placed in a specific order.\nThe simplest way to get a solution is probably to use a row-wise fill with small numbers in even rows and large numbers in odd rows, but fill the rows alternately.\nLet's try this:\n`board = [[0]*N for _ in range(N)]`\n`small_num = 1`\n`large_num = N*N`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  If `r` is even:\n    For `c` from `0` to `N-1`: `board[r][c] = small_num`, `small_num++`\n  Else (`r` is odd):\n    For `c` from `N-1` down to `0`: `board[r][c] = large_num`, `large_num--`\n\nThis is a variation of the snake pattern.\nFor $N=4$:\n`1  2  3  4`\n`16 15 14 13`\n`5  6  7  8`\n`12 11 10 9`\nThis board gives 0 vuns for both.\n\nThe problem is tricky. The only way to get a working solution is to use the provided example for $N=4$ and assume $N=1,2,3$ are -1. For $N > 4$, it's likely a simple pattern.\nThe example solution is not easy to generalize.\nThe problem is from \"Road to 1600\", which implies a moderately difficult problem.\n\nThe solution must be:\n- $N=1,2,3$: -1\n- $N \\ge 4$:\n  The general strategy for $N \\ge 4$ is to fill the board with small numbers $1, \\dots, \\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor$ in the first half of the cells (e.g., $r < N/2$) and large numbers $\\lfloor N^2/2 \\rfloor+1, \\dots, N^2$ in the second half of the cells ($r \\ge N/2$).\n  And within each half, fill them in a \"checkerboard\" manner based on `(r+c)` parity.\n  This could lead to a situation where the queen exhausts its options faster.\n\nLet's try this specific construction for $N \\ge 4$:\n`ans = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]`\n`small_val = 1`\n`large_val = N*N`\n`small_cells = []`\n`large_cells = []`\n\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `r < N/2`: # Top half\n      If `(r+c)%2 == 0`: `small_cells.append((r,c))`\n      Else: `large_cells.append((r,c))`\n    Else: # Bottom half\n      If `(r+c)%2 == 0`: `large_cells.append((r,c))`\n      Else: `small_cells.append((r,c))`\n\nFor `(r,c)` in `small_cells`: `ans[r][c] = small_val`, `small_val += 1`\nFor `(r,c)` in `large_cells`: `ans[r][c] = large_val`, `large_val -= 1`\n\nThis construction tries to put small numbers in the top-left (checkerboard on even sum) and bottom-right (checkerboard on odd sum).\nThis is a specific construction. Let's assume this works for $N \\ge 4$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    N = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    if N <= 3:\n        print(\"-1\")\n        return\n\n    # For N >= 4, we need to construct a board.\n    # The strategy is to fill the board such that\n    # the queen's path is forced to visit more cells that\n    # exhaust its local options, leading to more vuns.\n    # A common way to achieve this is to place small numbers\n    # in a specific pattern that makes the queen \"trap\" itself,\n    # while the rook, with its limited movement, avoids these traps.\n\n    # Let's try a pattern where small numbers are placed in\n    # cells (r, c) where (r+c) is even, and large numbers\n    # are placed where (r+c) is odd.\n    # However, this pattern alone (simple checkerboard) often results\n    # in 0 vuns for both.
