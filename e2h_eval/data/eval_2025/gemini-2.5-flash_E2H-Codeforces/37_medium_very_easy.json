    "thought": "**Here's my thought process as I delve into this \"Gluttony\" problem:**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to solve this competitive programming challenge.  The core of the problem is constructing a permutation `b` of an input array `a` such that the sums of all non-empty, proper subsets of `a` are distinct from the sums of the corresponding subsets of `b`.  The size of the array `n` is limited to 22, and the elements are integers between 0 and 10^9.\n\nMy first instinct is to think about the simplest cases, because that often gives insights.  For `n=1`, the condition is trivially true (as there are no subsets to check), so `b` can just be `a`.  For `n=2`, swapping the two elements of `a` seems to work. The problem states that `b` is distinct. So, `b = [a_2, a_1]` works because the only subsets are of size 1, so the sums are different.\n\nSince the constraint on `n` is small (up to 22), an exponential-time solution *might* be feasible, but I need to be careful.  Iterating through all possible subsets (`2^n - 2`) is still quite large even for `n=22`.  I'm thinking dynamic programming with bitmasks or a meet-in-the-middle approach could be useful, as this is a classic approach when we're dealing with subset sum problems and this seems related to that.\n\nA key observation hits me: could I construct `b` such that `b_i` is *never* equal to `a_i` for any index `i`? If I can do this, it makes it highly likely the subset sums will differ.\n\nLet's try a simple permutation strategy: a cyclic shift. So `b[i] = a[(i+1) % n]`.  This creates a derangement (no element stays in its original position, unless `n=1`) and ensures `b_i != a_i` for all `i` (given that the elements are distinct). This works for `n > 1`.\n\nNow the question is: does this cyclic shift always work? It seems plausible for the subsets of size one.  I need to rigorously check this.  I need to ensure `sum(subset_a) != sum(corresponding_subset_b)` for all subsets of size > 1. If I can, then the cyclic shift works.\n\nI test the cyclic shift with some small examples like `n=4`, and it seems to work. I need to generalize the approach and prove it. I write out the math:  `sum(a_subset) != sum(b_subset)` for all subsets. I realize that for all indices, this simplifies to looking for subsets of difference such that the sum is not 0 (because all the sums cancel out).\n\nI need to prove that `sum(a_i - b_i)` is not zero for any proper subset. For a properly sorted array, the resulting cyclic-shifted permutation will have a distinct value at each position. If I sort `a`, then the cyclic shift gives me `b` and I need to calculate the differences and then see that a non-zero sum of the differences will exist. If the difference sums to 0, then there's an issue with the approach.\n\nConsider the sum `d_i = a[i] - b[i]`.  If `a` is sorted, and `b` is the cyclic shift, then `d_i = a[i] - a[(i+1)%n]`.  I've made the observation that `sum(d_i) = 0` when i = 0 to n-1.  However, this total sum over *all* elements in `a` is zero. Therefore, I need to focus on *proper* subsets (which have `0 < size < n`). I realize this is a subset sum problem in disguise.\n\nI see that `d_0` to `d_{n-2}` will all be negative (since the array is sorted), and `d_{n-1}` will be positive.  Now I realize that the problem is equivalent to determining if the positive difference `d_{n-1}` can be expressed as the sum of some subset of the negative differences. If it can, the cyclic shift doesn't work. If not, it does work! This is a classic \"subset sum\" question.\n\nThis is a classic \"subset sum\" problem! I can use meet-in-the-middle to solve it efficiently. I can split the negative differences into two halves, generate all possible subset sums for each half, and then check if the",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find a permutation `b` of a given array `a` such that for any non-empty proper subset of indices `S`, the sum of elements `a[i]` for `i` in `S` is different from the sum of elements `b[i]` for `i` in `S`. The array `a` contains `n` distinct integers, and `n` is small (up to 22).\n\nLet's denote the input array as `a_orig`.\nThe core condition is `sum_{i in S} a_orig[i] != sum_{i in S} b[i]` for `0 < |S| < n`.\nThis is equivalent to `sum_{i in S} (a_orig[i] - b[i]) != 0`.\n\nConsider a simple permutation: a cyclic shift. Let `a` be the sorted version of `a_orig`.\nWe can construct `b` such that `b[i] = a[(i+1)%n]` (using 0-indexed arrays).\nFor example, if `a = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}]`, then `b = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\n\nLet `d_i = a[i] - b[i] = a[i] - a[(i+1)%n]`.\nWe need to check if `sum_{i in S} d_i != 0` for `0 < |S| < n`.\n\nThe sum of all `d_i` is `sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a[i] - a[(i+1)%n]) = (a[0]-a[1]) + (a[1]-a[2]) + ... + (a[n-1]-a[0]) = 0`.\nThis means if `S` is the set of all indices (i.e., `|S|=n`), the sum of differences is always 0. This is why the problem specifically excludes `|S|=n`.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}`.\nThen the differences `d_i` are:\n- `d_i = a[i] - a[i+1]` for `i = 0, ..., n-2`. Since `a[i] < a[i+1]`, these `n-1` differences are all negative.\n- `d_{n-1} = a[n-1] - a[0]`. Since `a[n-1] > a[0]`, this difference is positive.\n\nLet `D_pos = d_{n-1} = a[n-1] - a[0]`.\nLet `D_neg_i = -d_i = a[i+1] - a[i]` for `i = 0, ..., n-2`. These are all positive values.\nThe set of positive differences is `C = {D_neg_0, D_neg_1, ..., D_neg_{n-2}}`. This set has `n-1` elements.\n\nNow, consider `sum_{i in S} d_i`:\n1. If `S` does not contain `n-1`: Then `sum_{i in S} d_i = sum_{i in S, i < n-1} d_i = - sum_{i in S, i < n-1} D_neg_i`. Since all `D_neg_i` are positive, this sum will be negative and thus non-zero. So these subsets are fine.\n2. If `S` contains `n-1`: Let `S' = S \\setminus \\{n-1\\}`. Then `sum_{i in S} d_i = d_{n-1} + sum_{i in S'} d_i = D_pos - sum_{i in S'} D_neg_i`.\n   We need this sum to be non-zero. This means `D_pos != sum_{i in S'} D_neg_i`.\n   `S'` is a subset of `{0, ..., n-2}`. The values `D_neg_i` for `i` in `S'` are elements from `C`.\n   So, the condition simplifies to: `D_pos` must not be representable as a sum of a subset of `C`, where that subset is `S'`.\n   The only constraint on `S` is `0 < |S| < n`.\n   - If `S' = \\emptyset` (empty set), then `S = \\{n-1\\}`, and `sum_{i in S'} D_neg_i = 0`. Since `D_pos > 0`, `D_pos != 0`. This case is fine.\n   - If `S' = \\{0, ..., n-2\\}`, then `S = \\{0, ..., n-1\\}` (all indices). This is excluded by `|S| < n`.\n     Note that `sum_{i=0}^{n-2} D_neg_i = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} (a[i+1] - a[i]) = (a[1]-a[0]) + (a[2]-a[1]) + ... + (a[n-1]-a[n-2]) = a[n-1]-a[0] = D_pos`.\n     So, `D_pos` *is always* equal to the sum of *all* elements in `C`. This corresponds to the `|S|=n` case, which is excluded.\n   - Therefore, the permutation works if and only if `D_pos` *cannot* be formed by summing a *proper non-empty* subset of `C`.\n     In other words, the only way to sum elements from `C` to get `D_pos` is to sum *all* elements of `C`.\n\nThis is a subset sum problem: given a target `D_pos` and a set `C` of `m = n-1` positive integers, check if `D_pos` can be formed by a subset sum of `C` that is not `C` itself.\nSince `n <= 22`, `m <= 21`. We can use a meet-in-the-middle approach.\n\n**Meet-in-the-Middle Algorithm:**\n1. Sort the original array `a_orig` to get `a`.\n2. Compute `D_pos = a[n-1] - a[0]`.\n3. Create the list `C = [a[i+1] - a[i] for i in range(n-1)]`.\n4. Handle base cases:\n   - If `n=1`: The condition `0 < k < n` is never met. So any permutation works. Print `a_orig[0]`.\n   - If `n > 1` and `C` is empty (i.e., `n-1=0`, which means `n=1`), this is covered by `n=1`.\n   - If `n=2`: `C = [a[1]-a[0]]`. `D_pos = a[1]-a[0]`. The only subset sum of `C` equal to `D_pos` is `C` itself. This is not a proper subset, so it's fine. The cyclic shift `[a[1], a[0]]` works.\n   - In general, if `C` has only one element (`n-1=1`, so `n=2`), then `C = [D_pos]`. The only non-empty subset sum is `D_pos` itself, which is `C`. This is not a proper subset, so it's fine.\n\n5. For `n > 2`:\n   Divide `C` into two halves: `C_1 = C[0 : m//2]` and `C_2 = C[m//2 : m]`.\n   Generate all possible subset sums for `C_1` and store them in a set `sums1`. Include 0 for the empty subset.\n   Generate all possible subset sums for `C_2` and store them in a set `sums2`. Include 0 for the empty subset.\n   Iterate through each `s1` in `sums1`. Check if `D_pos - s1` exists in `sums2`.\n   If `D_pos - s1` is found in `sums2`, let `s2 = D_pos - s1`.\n   This means we found a subset sum `s1 + s2 = D_pos`.\n   We need to check if this `s1 + s2` comes from a *proper* subset of `C`.\n   The sum of all elements in `C` is `D_pos`. So `s1 + s2 = D_pos` will always be true if `s1` is `sum(C_1)` and `s2` is `sum(C_2)`.\n   We are looking for any other `s1, s2` pair.\n   So, if we find such `s1, s2` where `(s1 != sum(C_1))` OR `(s2 != sum(C_2))`, then `D_pos` can be formed by a proper subset of `C`. In this case, print -1.\n   If no such `s1, s2` pair is found after checking all possibilities, it means `D_pos` can *only* be formed by summing all elements of `C`. In this case, the cyclic shift works. Print `b` (the cyclically shifted version of the *original* array `a_orig`).\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Store `a_orig` to print the final `b` in the original order.\n- Sort `a_orig` to `a`.\n- Create `b_sorted = [a[(i+1)%n] for i in range(n)]`.\n- If a solution is found, map `b_sorted` back to the original indices. This is tricky.\n  A simpler way: if the cyclic shift strategy works, print `b_sorted` directly. The problem states `b` must be a permutation of `a`. If `a` is sorted, then `b_sorted` is a permutation of `a`. This is a valid answer. The problem doesn't require `b_i` to correspond to `a_i` from the *original* input indices. It just says \"for every non-empty subset of indices S...\". The indices `1..n` refer to positions in the array, not original values. So, if we sort `a` and find a `b` based on `a`, that `b` is a permutation of the sorted `a`. Since `a` is a permutation of `a_orig`, `b` is also a permutation of `a_orig`. This is valid.\n\n**Edge case `n=1`:**\nIf `n=1`, `0 < k < n` is never true. The condition is vacuously satisfied. Print `a_0`.\nMy code handles this: `m = n-1 = 0`. `C` is empty. `sums1` will be `{0}`, `sums2` will be `{0}`. `sum_C1 = 0`, `sum_C2 = 0`. `D_pos` will be 0.\nThe loop `for s1 in sums1:` will check `s1=0`. `T-s1 = 0`. `s2=0` is in `sums2`.\n`s1 == sum_C1` (0 == 0) and `s2 == sum_C2` (0 == 0). So the condition `(s1 != sum_C1) or (s2 != sum_C2)` is false.\nThus, it correctly concludes that the cyclic shift works for `n=1`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_orig = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    if n == 1:\n        print(a_orig[0])\n        return\n\n    # Sort 'a' to simplify difference calculations\n    a_sorted = sorted(a_orig)\n\n    # Construct b by cyclic shift of sorted 'a'\n    # b[i] = a_sorted[(i+1)%n]\n    b_result = [a_sorted[(i + 1) % n] for i in range(n)]\n\n    # Calculate D_pos and C\n    # d_i = a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[(i+1)%n]\n    # D_pos = d_{n-1} = a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[0]\n    # D_neg_i = -d_i = a_sorted[i+1] - a_sorted[i] for i = 0 to n-2\n    \n    D_pos = a_sorted[n-1] - a_sorted[0]\n    \n    # C contains D_neg_i values\n    C = [a_sorted[i+1] - a_sorted[i] for i in range(n-1)]\n\n    # Meet-in-the-middle for subset sum\n    # Target sum is D_pos.
