There are $$$n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-1}$$$ distinct$$$^\\dagger$$$ edge-weighted trees with $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that each edge is either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$. Your task is to find the sum of $$$d(1,n)^\\ddagger$$$ of all such trees that are good. Since the answer can be quite large, you only need to find it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.$$$^\\dagger$$$ Two trees are considered to be distinct if either:   there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in one of the trees, and not in the other.  there exists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in both trees but the weight of the edge between them in one tree is different from the one in the other tree. Note that by Cayley's formula, the number of trees on $$$n$$$ labeled vertices is $$$n^{n-2}$$$. Since we have $$$n-1$$$ edges, there are $$$2^{n-1}$$$ possible assignment of weights(weight can either be $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$). That is why total number of distinct edge-weighted tree is $$$n^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{n-1}$$$.$$$^\\ddagger$$$ $$$d(u,v)$$$ denotes the sum of the weight of all edges on the unique simple path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nThe only line of output should contain a single integer, the required answer, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '1', '4', '10', '43434']\n\n### Output\n['998244352', '0', '998244343', '948359297', '86232114']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, there is only $$$1$$$ distinct good tree. The value of $$$d(1,2)$$$ for that tree is $$$-1$$$, which is $$$998\\,244\\,352$$$ under modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.In the second test case, the value of $$$d(1,1)$$$ for any tree is $$$0$$$, so the answer is $$$0$$$.In the third test case, there are $$$16$$$ distinct good trees. The value of $$$d(1,4)$$$ is:   $$$-2$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees;  $$$-1$$$ for $$$8$$$ trees;  $$$0$$$ for $$$4$$$ trees;  $$$1$$$ for $$$2$$$ trees. The sum of $$$d(1,4)$$$ over all trees is $$$2 \\cdot (-2) + 8 \\cdot (-1) + 4 \\cdot (0) + 2 \\cdot (1) = -10$$$, which is $$$998\\,244\\,343$$$ under modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

My previous reasoning was correct.\n    # The sum N_+(e) - N_-(e) = 0 for n > 2.\n    # This would mean the total sum is 0 for n > 2.\n    # But example for n=4 is -10.\n\n    # What is the flaw?\n    # The result N_+(e) = N_-(e) = 2^(n-3) is for ANY edge e.\n    # What if the path from 1 to n is special?\n    # No, it should hold for any edge.\n\n    # Let's check the source of this result.\n    # \"The number of trees on n labeled vertices where each edge has weight +/-1 such that the product of weights incident to each vertex is -1\"\n    # This is exactly the definition of a good tree.\n    # \"For any fixed tree T, the number of such weight assignments is 2^(n-2) if n is even, and 0 if n is odd.\"\n    # We already established n must be even. So 2^(n-2) is correct.\n\n    # \"For a fixed tree T and a fixed edge e, the number of such assignments where w_e = 1 is 2^(n-3), and w_e = -1 is 2^(n-3).\"\n    # This is also a standard result. It is based on the fact that if you fix the weight of one edge, the remaining system of equations still has rank n-1 and n-2 variables, giving 2^(n-3) solutions.\n    # This implies that Sum_{W good for T} w_e(W) = 0 for any edge e in any fixed tree T (when n > 2).\n    # This leads to the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees being 0 for n > 2.\n\n    # This contradicts the example for n=4.

Yes, it's just a subset of edges.\n\n    # Let's re-evaluate n=4 example.\n    # n=4. Number of good trees = 4^(4-2) * 2^(4-2) = 4^2 * 2^2 = 16 * 4 = 64.\n    # Example says 16 distinct good trees. Why is my count different?\n    # The total number of trees is n^(n-2).\n    # For a fixed tree structure, there are 2^(n-2) good weight assignments if n is even.\n    # So total good trees = n^(n-2) * 2^(n-2).\n    # For n=4, this is 4^2 * 2^2 = 16 * 4 = 64.\n    # The example says 16 distinct good trees. This is 4^(4-2) * 2^(4-2-1) = 4^2 * 2^1 = 16 * 2 = 32.\n    # Or 4^(4-2) * 2^(4-2) / 2 = 32.\n    # What is the discrepancy?\n    # \"If n is even, the number of good weight assignments for a given tree is 2^(n-2).\" (This is correct)\n    # \"The total number of good trees is n^(n-2) * 2^(n-2).\" (This is correct based on the above)\n\n    # Why does the example say 16 for n=4?\n    # Maybe the definition of \"good tree\" in the example implies something about the structure?\n    # No, it's just the product condition.\n    # \"The value of d(1,4) is: -2 for 2 trees; -1 for 8 trees; 0 for 4 trees; 1 for 2 trees.

My formula gives 64.\n    # This means my formula for \"number of good trees\" is wrong, or the example is using a different definition.\n\n    # Let's re-derive the number of good weight assignments for a fixed tree T.\n    # Let x_e = 1 if w_e = -1, x_e = 0 if w_e = 1.\n    # For each vertex i, sum_{e incident to i} x_e = 1 (mod 2).\n    # This is a system of n linear equations over GF(2) with n-1 variables.\n    # Let A be the incidence matrix (n x (n-1)).\n    # We want to solve A x = 1 (vector of all ones).\n    # The rank of A is n-1.\n    # The sum of rows of A is the zero vector (each column has two 1s).\n    # So, if we sum the equations: sum_i (sum_{e incident to i} x_e) = sum_i 1.\n    # Left side: sum_e (sum_{i incident to e} x_e) = sum_e (2 x_e) = 0 (mod 2).\n    # Right side: sum_i 1 = n (mod 2).\n    # So we must have n = 0 (mod 2).
