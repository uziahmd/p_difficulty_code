Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Refining the Triangle Counting Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this triangle counting problem again, and I need to come up with a Python script for it. The goal is to efficiently count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x, y, z` under the given constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`. I've already realized that the standard triangle inequality conditions simplify greatly since the constraints imply `x <= y <= z`.  This means I only need to ensure `x + y > z` for a valid triangle.\n\nMy initial thought was a triple nested loop, but that quickly became a non-starter.  Even with a more sensible bound, the complexity grows to `O(D^3)` which is way too slow. So, let's step back. Fixing two variables at a time is the way to go here.\n\nNow, my approach will be this: for each possible pair of `(x, y)` that fit my bounds, I'll figure out the valid range for `z`.  I know `A <= x <= B` and `B <= y <= C`.  I also know that `C <= z <= D`. But, I also know `x + y > z`, so `z < x + y`. Therefore, `z` must be within the intersection of `[C, D]` and `[C, x+y-1]`. I define `max_z = min(D, x + y - 1)`. The number of valid `z` values would be `max(0, max_z - C + 1)`.\n\nSo, the core of the algorithm will be a double loop iterating `x` from `A` to `B`, and `y` from `B` to `C`. For each `(x, y)` pair, I'll calculate the valid range for `z` and add the count to the total. This should be much better: `O((B-A+1)(C-B+1))`.  Worst case, this looks like `(2.5e5)*(2.5e5)` or roughly `O(6.25 * 10^10)`. Which is much more manageable than cubic complexity.  Let's code it up!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x, y, z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nFirst, let's establish the conditions for a non-degenerate triangle. For sides `x, y, z`, the triangle inequalities are:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`, it implies `x <= y <= z`.\nWith `x, y, z` being positive integers (since `A >= 1`):\n- `y + z > x`: Since `z >= y >= x` and `y >= 1`, `y + z >= x + 1 > x`. This inequality always holds.\n- `x + z > y`: Since `z >= y` and `x >= 1`, `x + z >= y + 1 > y`. This inequality always holds.\n\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to satisfy is `x + y > z`.\n\nSo, we need to count triplets `(x, y, z)` that satisfy:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z` (or equivalently, `z <= x + y - 1`)\n\nLet's iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`.\nFor each `x` in `[A, B]` and `y` in `[B, C]`, we need to find the number of `z` values that satisfy:\n- `C <= z <= D`\n- `z <= x + y - 1`\n\nCombining these, `z` must be in the range `[C, min(D, x + y - 1)]`.\nThe number of such `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\n\nA naive approach would be to use nested loops for `x` and `y`, and then calculate this count.\n`x` iterates from `A` to `B`. `y` iterates from `B` to `C`.\nThe complexity would be `O((B-A+1) * (C-B+1))`.\nIn the worst case, `A=1, B=2.5 \\cdot 10^5, C=5 \\cdot 10^5`. This would be `O((2.5 \\cdot 10^5)^2) = O(6.25 \\cdot 10^{10})`, which is too slow. The maximum value of `D` is `5 \\cdot 10^5`.\n\nWe need a more efficient way to sum `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)` over all valid `x, y`.\n\nLet `S = x + y`. The condition `z <= x + y - 1` becomes `z <= S - 1`.\nThe range for `S` is `A + B <= S <= B + C`.\nFor a fixed `S`, we need to count pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = S` and `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`.\nThen, for each such `S`, we add `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)` to the total count.\n\nLet `count_xy[s]` be the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = s`, `A <= x <= B`, and `B <= y <= C`.\nWe can calculate `count_xy` efficiently.\nIterate `x` from `A` to `B`. For each `x`, `y` must be `S - x`.\nThe conditions on `y` are `B <= S - x <= C`.\nThis means `S - C <= x <= S - B`.\nSo for a fixed `S`, `x` must satisfy:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `S - C <= x <= S - B`\nThus, `x` must be in `[max(A, S - C), min(B, S - B)]`.\nThe number of such `x` (and thus `y`) is `max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1)`.\n\nThis is still not quite right, as `count_xy` depends on `S`. We need to compute `count_xy[s]` for all relevant `s`.\nThe range for `s = x + y` is from `A + B` to `B + C`. The maximum value for `B + C` is `5 \\cdot 10^5 + 5 \\cdot 10^5 = 10^6`.\nWe can create an array `count_xy` of size `B + C + 1`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Initialize `count_xy = [0] * (B + C + 1)`.\n2. Iterate `x` from `A` to `B`.\n   For each `x`, `y` can range from `B` to `C`.\n   Instead of iterating `y` directly, we can use a difference array approach to populate `count_xy`.\n   For a fixed `x`, `y` can be any value in `[B, C]`.\n   The sum `s = x + y` will range from `x + B` to `x + C`.\n   So, for each `x`, we increment `count_xy[x + B]` by 1 and decrement `count_xy[x + C + 1]` by 1.\n   This marks a range `[x+B, x+C]` where `s` values appear due to this `x`.\n\n3. After iterating `x` from `A` to `B`, convert `count_xy` into prefix sums:\n   `count_xy[s] = count_xy[s] + count_xy[s-1]` for `s` from `A + B + 1` up to `B + C`.\n   Now, `count_xy[s]` correctly stores the number of pairs `(x, y)` such that `x + y = s` and `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`.\n\n4. Initialize `total_triangles = 0`.\n5. Iterate `s` from `A + B` to `B + C`.\n   Let `num_xy_pairs = count_xy[s]`.\n   If `num_xy_pairs == 0`, continue to the next `s`.\n   Calculate the number of valid `z` values for this `s`:\n   `max_z = min(D, s - 1)`.\n   `num_z = max(0, max_z - C + 1)`.\n   Add `num_xy_pairs * num_z` to `total_triangles`.\n\n6. Print `total_triangles`.\n\nComplexity Analysis:\n- Step 1: `O(B + C)`\n- Step 2: `O(B - A + 1)` operations. Each operation is `O(1)`. Total `O(B)`.\n- Step 3: `O(B + C)` operations.\n- Step 4: `O(1)`\n- Step 5: `O(B + C)` operations.\n- Step 6: `O(1)`\n\nThe overall time complexity is `O(B + C)`, which is `O(D)` in the worst case (since `B, C <= D`).\nGiven `D <= 5 \\cdot 10^5`, this is `O(5 \\cdot 10^5)`, which is efficient enough.\nThe space complexity is `O(B + C)` for the `count_xy` array, also `O(D)`, which is `O(5 \\cdot 10^5)` integers. This is acceptable.\n\nLet's check the maximum value for `s`. `B + C` can be up to `5 \\cdot 10^5 + 5 \\cdot 10^5 = 10^6`.\nSo, `count_xy` array needs to be of size `10^6 + 1`.\n\nExample 1: `A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4`\n`count_xy` array of size `2+3+1 = 6`. Indices 0 to 5.\nInitialize `count_xy = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (we care about sums `s` from `A+B=3` to `B+C=5`).\n\nIterate `x` from `A=1` to `B=2`:\n- `x = 1`:\n  `s` ranges from `1+B=1+2=3` to `1+C=1+3=4`.\n  `count_xy[3] += 1`\n  `count_xy[4+1] -= 1` (i.e., `count_xy[5] -= 1`)\n  `count_xy = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, -1]`\n- `x = 2`:\n  `s` ranges from `2+B=2+2=4` to `2+C=2+3=5`.\n  `count_xy[4] += 1`\n  `count_xy[5+1] -= 1` (i.e., `count_xy[6]` which is out of bounds, but conceptually `count_xy[B+C+1]` is `count_xy[6]`)\n  `count_xy = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1]`\n\nPrefix sums for `count_xy`:\n`s=0: 0`\n`s=1: 0`\n`s=2: 0`\n`s=3: 1`\n`s=4: 1+1=2`\n`s=5: 2-1=1`\nSo, `count_xy = [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]` (up to index 5)\n`count_xy[3]=1`: `(1,2)`\n`count_xy[4]=2`: `(1,3), (2,2)`\n`count_xy[5]=1`: `(2,3)`\n\nCalculate total triangles:\n`total_triangles = 0`\nIterate `s` from `A+B=3` to `B+C=5`:\n- `s = 3`: `num_xy_pairs = count_xy[3] = 1`.\n  `max_z = min(D, s-1) = min(4, 3-1) = min(4, 2) = 2`.\n  `num_z = max(0, max_z - C + 1) = max(0, 2 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 0) = 0`.\n  `total_triangles += 1 * 0 = 0`.\n- `s = 4`: `num_xy_pairs = count_xy[4] = 2`.\n  `max_z = min(D, s-1) = min(4, 4-1) = min(4, 3) = 3`.\n  `num_z = max(0, max_z - C + 1) = max(0, 3 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 1) = 1`.\n  `total_triangles += 2 * 1 = 2`.\n- `s = 5`: `num_xy_pairs = count_xy[5] = 1`.\n  `max_z = min(D, s-1) = min(4, 5-1) = min(4, 4) = 4`.\n  `num_z = max(0, max_z - C + 1) = max(0, 4 - 3 + 1) = max(0, 2) = 2`.\n  `total_triangles += 1 * 2 = 2`.\n\nFinal `total_triangles = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4`.
