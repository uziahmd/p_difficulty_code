The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my understanding of the gilded cell problem:**\n\nThe goal is to figure out how many cells are \"gilded\" on a rectangular plate, which are essentially border cells that make up several rings. I need a Python script to do this.\n\nThe key information is: the plate's dimensions (`w` width, `h` height), and the number of gilded rings (`k`).  Each ring is a border around a shrinking inner rectangle. The outermost ring runs along the plate's edge, then each subsequent ring is formed inward from this ring.\n\nI need a way to calculate the number of cells in each ring. My initial idea was to take the total cells and subtract the inner cells, or to use the formula  `2W + 2H - 4` where `W` and `H` are width and height.\n\nI need to confirm the inner rectangle dimensions are suitable. Each subsequent rectangle gets 4 less for both its width and height (2 from each side).\n\nThe constraint `k <= floor((min(w, h) + 1) / 4)` is important because it ensures that for the calculations I can always assume the dimensions are at least 3x3 for any inner rectangle. This means I can use the simplified formula `2W + 2H - 4` to determine the cells in each ring, without needing to handle edge cases where the inner rectangle might be too small, since all values will be valid.\n\nSince `W, H >= 3`, the perimeter formula works.\n\nIn the calculation, I'll loop `k` times, adding the number of cells in each ring, to the total.\n\nI need to make sure the loop indices line up with the problem, considering it has a 1-indexed description of the rings, and convert that into Python's 0-indexed loop.  `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, or `1` to `k`, in the program loop.\n\nFinally, I'll print the total gilded cells. The approach seems sound.\n",
