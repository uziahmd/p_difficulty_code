Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Solution Derivation for the \"Crazy Town\" Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're given a classic computational geometry problem where the goal is to find the minimum number of line crossings to get from a start point (home) to an end point (university). My initial thought is that this screams \"graph theory\" or \"breadth-first search,\" but given the line-crossing aspect, a more direct geometrical approach is likely more efficient, considering the constraint on the number of lines.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Input and Output:**  We're dealing with coordinates and line equations. The key is that crossing a line represents a \"step.\" We need to figure out how many lines *separate* the home and university regions. The fact that the home and university don't lie on any of the lines is crucial; it simplifies things.\n\n2.  **The \"Separation\" Idea:** This is the core insight. If a line separates the home and university (meaning they are on opposite sides), we *must* cross it. If a line doesn't separate them, it's irrelevant to the minimum path.  This leads to the question of *how* to determine if a line separates two points.\n\n3.  **Using Line Equations:**  We know a line is defined by  `ax + by + c = 0`.  Plugging in a point (x0, y0) gives us `ax0 + by0 + c`.  The sign of this expression tells us which side of the line the point is on.  Positive means one side, negative means the other. The crucial part: if the *signs* of this expression are different for the home and university, the line separates them.  The guarantee that the home/university aren't on any line means we won't get a zero result, which makes the check reliable.\n\n4.  **The Algorithm:**  We iterate through each line. For each line, we evaluate the expression `ax + by + c` for both the home and university coordinates.  If the products of these values is less than zero, the signs are different, we increment the \"steps\" counter.  Otherwise, we ignore the line.\n\n5.  **Efficiency and Implementation:** The core logic involves a loop that iterates through the lines. For each line, constant-time arithmetic operations are performed. The time complexity is, therefore, O(n), where 'n' is the number of lines. This is efficient given the constraint of up to 300 lines. The code will simply read in the inputs, calculate the line separation check, and print the resulting step count. There's no need for any complex data structures or graph algorithms here. It's a direct geometric calculation.\n\n6.  **Code Considerations:**  Python's arbitrary-precision integers will handle the calculations without overflow, given that the coordinates and coefficients are within 10^6. Using `sys.stdin.readline()` for input is more efficient than `input()`. The check `val1 * val2 < 0` is a concise way to determine if two values have different signs.\n\nIn short, the solution is to count how many of the given lines have the home and the university on opposite sides.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to move from a block containing your home to a block containing the university. A step is defined as moving from one block to an adjacent block if they share a common border of non-zero length. This effectively means crossing one of the given line roads.\n\nThe key insight is that the minimum number of steps required is simply the number of lines that separate your home from the university. If a line separates your home and the university, you *must* cross it to get from one point to the other. If a line does not separate them, you don't need to cross it to reach the target region (though you might cross it and cross back, which would be inefficient). Therefore, we only count the lines that act as a barrier between the two points.\n\nA line defined by the equation `ax + by + c = 0` divides the plane into two half-planes. For any point `(x0, y0)` not on the line, the expression `ax0 + by0 + c` will be either positive or negative. All points in one half-plane will yield a value with the same sign, and all points in the other half-plane will yield a value with the opposite sign.\n\nSo, to determine if a line separates two points `(x1, y1)` (home) and `(x2, y2)` (university):\n1.  Calculate `val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c`.\n2.  Calculate `val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c`.\n\nIf `val1` and `val2` have different signs, then the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are on opposite sides of the line, and the line separates them. We increment our step counter in this case.\nIf `val1` and `val2` have the same sign, then both points are on the same side of the line, and the line does not separate them. We do not increment the counter.\n\nThe problem guarantees that neither the home nor the university lies on any road, which means `val1` and `val2` will never be zero. A concise way to check if two non-zero numbers have different signs is to see if their product is negative (`val1 * val2 < 0`).\n\nWe iterate through all `n` roads, perform this check for each road, and sum up the counts.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Read the coordinates of home `(x1, y1)`.\n2.  Read the coordinates of university `(x2, y2)`.\n3.  Read the number of roads `n`.\n4.  Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n5.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read the coefficients `a, b, c` for the line `ax + by + c = 0`.\n    b.  Calculate `val_home = a*x1 + b*y1 + c`.\n    c.  Calculate `val_univ = a*x2 + b*y2 + c`.\n    d.  If `val_home * val_univ < 0`, increment `steps`.\n6.  Print the final value of `steps`.\n\n**Example 1:**\nHome: (1, 1), University: (-1, -1)\nRoad 1: `0x + 1y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `y = 0`)\n  `val_home = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1`\n  `val_univ = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n  `1 * (-1) = -1 < 0`. Different signs, so `steps = 1`.\nRoad 2: `1x + 0y + 0 = 0` (i.e., `x = 0`)\n  `val_home = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1`\n  `val_univ = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1`\n  `1 * (-1) = -1 < 0`. Different signs, so `steps = 2`.\nOutput: 2\n\nThis approach is efficient, running in O(N) time, where N is the number of roads. The coordinate and coefficient values can be up to 10^6, so `a*x` or `b*y` can be up to 10^12.
