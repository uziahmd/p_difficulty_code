There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, here's my understanding of the \"Tennis Championship\" problem and how I'd approach it:**\n\nMy goal is to find the maximum number of games a tournament winner can play, given the game-pairing rule. The rule is that two players can only play if the difference in the number of games they've already played is at most one.\n\nI start by realizing that to maximize the winner's games, the winner should always play against opponents who have played the fewest possible games. I define `f(k)` as the minimum number of players needed to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\n\nI consider `N(k)`, the minimum number of players needed for a winner to play *k* games. I'll build this up:\n*   `N(0)` is 1 (a starting player with no games)\n*   `N(1)` is 2 (2 players can play one match)\n*   `N(2)` is 3\n*   `N(3)` is 5\n*   `N(4)` is 8\n\nThen I spot the pattern! This `N(k)` looks like the Fibonacci sequence, shifted. Specifically, `N(k) = F_{k+2}` where `F` is the Fibonacci sequence starting with 0, 1. I prove this using the rule `|k_A - k_B| <= 1` and realizing that to reach `k`, I need the minimum number of players by choosing opponents with `k-2`, `k-1` or `k` games. Choosing `k-2` minimizes the numbers of players. So `N(k) = N(k-1) + N(k-2)` is the recurrence. This yields the shifted Fibonacci pattern.\n\nThe problem input is the total number of players `n`. I want to find the largest *k* such that `N(k) <= n`, or `F_{k+2} <= n`.  Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so I realize I can calculate them in an iterative loop. Since n can be as big as 10^18, a logarithmic (in the number of games) approach to calculate the result is necessary.  I initialize two variables, say `a` and `b`, to `N(0)=1` and `N(1)=2`, respectively. Then in a loop, I iteratively generate Fibonacci numbers by adding `a` and `b`. The `games` counter (initialized to 1) is incremented with each successful iteration. Once the newly calculated Fibonacci value exceeds n, the loop breaks. The value `games - 1` is the final answer, i.e., the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach should be efficient for handling large inputs because calculating the Fibonacci sequence up to a reasonable point takes logarithmic (in number of games) time, which is much better than calculating the value directly. I've tested various cases and edge cases with this approach and it is correct.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given `n` participants and a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games to continue.\n\nLet `k` be the number of games a player has won. To maximize the winner's games, we need to minimize the total number of players required for the winner to achieve `k` wins. Let `N(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\n\n1.  **Base Cases:**\n    *   `N(0)`: A player who has played 0 games. This is just 1 player. So, `N(0) = 1`.\n    *   `N(1)`: A winner who has played 1 game. This requires two players (A and B), both with 0 games played. They play, one wins, having played 1 game. `|0 - 0| <= 1` is valid. So, `N(1) = 2`.\n\n2.  **Recursive Relation:**\n    Consider a winner `W` who is about to play their `k`-th game. Before this game, `W` has played `k-1` games and won all of them. `W` needs `N(k-1)` players to reach this state.\n    `W`'s opponent, let's call them `O`, must also have won all their games to reach this point. Let `O` have played `k_O` games.\n    The rule states that `| (k-1) - k_O | <= 1`. This means `k_O` can be `k-2`, `k-1`, or `k`.\n    To minimize the total number of players `N(k)`, we should choose `O` to be a player who required the minimum number of participants to reach their `k_O` games. Since `N(x)` is an increasing function (more games require more initial players), we should choose the smallest possible `k_O`.\n    The smallest valid `k_O` is `k-2`. (If `k-2 < 0`, this reasoning might need adjustment, but for `k >= 2`, `k-2 >= 0`).\n    When `W` (with `k-1` games) plays `O` (with `k-2` games), the condition `|(k-1) - (k-2)| = |1| = 1` is satisfied.\n    Therefore, the minimum number of players required for `W` to play `k` games is the sum of players needed for `W` to reach `k-1` games and players needed for `O` to reach `k-2` games:\n    `N(k) = N(k-1) + N(k-2)` for `k >= 2`.\n\n3.  **Fibonacci Sequence Connection:**\n    Let's check the sequence generated by `N(k)`:\n    `N(0) = 1`\n    `N(1) = 2`\n    `N(2) = N(1) + N(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`\n    `N(3) = N(2) + N(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`\n    `N(4) = N(3) + N(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`\n    This sequence corresponds to the Fibonacci numbers `F_m` if we define `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, ...`.\n    Specifically, `N(k) = F_{k+2}`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Maximum `k`:**\n    Given `n` players, we want to find the maximum `k` such that `N(k) <= n`, which means finding the maximum `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n    Since `n` can be up to `10^18`, `k` will be relatively small (around 80-90, as Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially). We can iterate through Fibonacci numbers until we find one that exceeds `n`.\n\n    We can implement this iteratively:\n    *   Initialize `a = N(0) = 1` (which is `F_2`).\n    *   Initialize `b = N(1) = 2` (which is `F_3`).\n    *   Initialize `games_played = 1` (representing `k` for `N(1)`).\n    *   Loop: While `b <= n`:\n        *   Calculate `next_fib = a + b`.\n        *   Update `a = b`.\n        *   Update `b = next_fib`.\n        *   Increment `games_played`.\n    *   When the loop terminates, `b` is the first `F_{k'+2}` that is greater than `n`. The value `games_played` would have been incremented one too many times. So, the maximum number of games the winner can play is `games_played - 1`.\n\nExample Walkthrough for `n=10`:\n1.  Initialize `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `games_played = 1`.\n2.  `b (2) <= n (10)` is true.\n    `next_fib = 1 + 2 = 3`. `a = 2`. `b = 3`. `games_played = 2`.\n3.  `b (3) <= n (10)` is true.\n    `next_fib = 2 + 3 = 5`. `a = 3`. `b = 5`. `games_played = 3`.\n4.  `b (5) <= n (10)` is true.\n    `next_fib = 3 + 5 = 8`. `a = 5`. `b = 8`. `games_played = 4`.\n5.  `b (8) <= n (10)` is true.\n    `next_fib = 5 + 8 = 13`. `a = 8`. `b = 13`. `games_played = 5`.\n6.  `b (13) <= n (10)` is false. Loop terminates.\n7.  The result is `games_played - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n\nThis approach correctly handles the given examples and the constraints on `n`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # N(k) is the minimum number of players required to produce a winner\n    # who has played k games.\n    # The recurrence relation is N(k) = N(k-1) + N(k-2) for k >= 2.\n    # Base cases:\n    # N(0) = 1 (a single player, no games played)\n    # N(1) = 2 (two players, one game, one winner)\n    # This sequence corresponds to Fibonacci numbers F_m where F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...\n    # Specifically, N(k) = F_{k+2}.\n\n    # We want to find the maximum k such that N(k) <= n,\n    # which means finding the maximum k such that F_{k+2} <= n.\n\n    # Initialize 'a' and 'b' to the first two relevant Fibonacci numbers.\n    # 'a' represents F_2 (which is N(0)).\n    # 'b' represents F_3 (which is N(1)).\n    a = 1  # Corresponds to N(0)\n    b = 2  # Corresponds to N(1)\n    \n    # 'games_played' tracks the 'k' value for the current 'b' (N(k)).\n    # Initially, b=N(1), so games_played starts at 1.\n    games_played = 1\n\n    # Iterate, generating Fibonacci numbers (N(k) values)\n    # until N(k) exceeds n.\n    while b <= n:\n        # Calculate the next Fibonacci number in the sequence.\n        next_fib = a + b\n        # Update 'a' and 'b' to advance the sequence.\n        a = b\n        b = next_fib\n        # Increment the count of games played by the winner.\n        games_played += 1\n    \n    # When the loop finishes, 'b' is the first N(k) value that is greater than 'n'.\n    # This means the maximum number of games the winner could play is for the N(k) value\n    # that was stored in 'a' in the last successful iteration.\n    # 'games_played' was incremented one too many times, so we subtract 1.\n    sys.stdout.write(str(games_played - 1) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
