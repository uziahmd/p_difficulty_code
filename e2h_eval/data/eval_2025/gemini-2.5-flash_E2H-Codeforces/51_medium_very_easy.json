Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Amusing Joke Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to solve this \"Amusing Joke\" problem, a straightforward competitive programming challenge.  The core idea is to determine if a pile of letters can be formed by combining a guest's and host's names.\n\nMy thought process is this:  I'll start with the input format: three lines â€“ guest, host, and the pile. The critical condition is that the pile's letters must *exactly* match the combined guest and host names, potentially scrambled. This screams \"character counting\" or \"sorted strings\".\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll need to sort the combined name and the pile, and compare them. The problem states that the total character counts *must* be the same. This can easily be checked by sorting.  Also, an early test case gave me pause and made me really pay attention to the exact character counts, which is crucial for determining \"YES\" or \"NO\". I also had to quickly correct my own manual sorting error on the second example.\n\nSo, the algorithm becomes:\n1.  Read in the guest, host, and pile names.\n2.  Combine guest and host.\n3.  Sort the combined names.\n4.  Sort the pile.\n5.  Compare the sorted strings. If identical, \"YES\"; otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThe implementation is simple using Python: `input()` to get the lines, string concatenation (`+`), and `sorted()` to sort the characters and `\"\".join()` to create a sorted string for comparison. I've also re-checked the solution with a thorough test case which confirmed my thoughts on the character counts. I'll make sure to get rid of the code comments before the final version. Also, I've checked all the problem's requirements, including standard input/output. This should be a quick and efficient solution.\n",
