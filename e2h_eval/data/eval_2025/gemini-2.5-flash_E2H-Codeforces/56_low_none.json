            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Guard Duty (easy)\n\nThe Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Guard Duty Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Guard Duty (easy)\" problem and immediately my mind goes to the core challenge: finding a non-intersecting perfect matching between Rebel ships and bases.  First things first, I need to understand the constraints and the fundamental problem setup. We've got `R` rebels and `B` bases, each with coordinates.  The heart of it is this: can we link each ship to one base, and each base to one ship, *without* those connection lines crossing? That sets the stage.\n\nThe obvious first check is that `R` and `B` need to be equal for a perfect matching to even be possible. If they're not equal, it's a quick \"No\" and we're done.  Let's assume `R = B = N`, and delve deeper.\n\nMy expert intuition kicks in. The non-intersecting segment condition is key. This is a classic geometric matching problem, so there must be a clean way to find the solution. I know this type of geometric reasoning. If I had infinite time I would start with convex hulls, considering whether they overlap or one is contained in the other.\n\nHowever, the size constraints come into play.  `N` is small – up to 10. That's the golden ticket!  With such a small input size, brute force is suddenly an option, a *very* viable option.  `N!` permutations, at most 3.6 million matchings to check.  That's completely manageable.\n\nMy strategy becomes clear:\n\n1.  Input the data.\n2.  If R != B, print \"No\"\n3.  Generate all the permutations.\n4. For each matching I'd then have to check for segment intersections (N * (N - 1) / 2 checks).\n5.  If any non-intersecting matching is found, return \"Yes\". Otherwise, return \"No\".\n\nThis brute-force approach, combined with efficient intersection checking, should do the trick. Now it's a matter of translating this into Python code. The core logic is defined!\n",
