Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Analyzing Triangle Inequality Constraints for Integer Side Counts**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script to count non-degenerate triangles. The sides are integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`. The constraints on the side lengths are `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.  My focus is on understanding the triangle inequality and how it interacts with these bounds.\n\nFirst, I recall the triangle inequality: `x + y > z`, `x + z > y`, and `y + z > x`.  With the given ranges, I start to reason about these inequalities individually.\n\nSince I have these ranges: `x` is in `[A, B]`, `y` is in `[B, C]`, and `z` is in `[C, D]`.  I notice immediately that since `y` is *at least* `B` and `x` is *at most* `B`, their relative size is uncertain but `y` could definitely be greater than `x`.\n\nLooking at the inequalities, I reason as follows. The second condition, `x + z > y`, is always true. Since `z` is always greater than or equal to `C`, and `y` is at most `C`, and `x` is always positive, adding `x` to `z` will always be larger than or equal to `y`. Similarly, `y + z > x` is always true. This is because `y` is always at least `B`, and `z` is always at least `C`, and `x` is at most `B`. So, their sum will be larger than `x`.\n\nThat leaves me with only one inequality that matters, `x + y > z`. This is the core condition I need to check in my script, given the range restrictions. I'll need to efficiently iterate through valid combinations of x, y, and z within the specified ranges, but only increment the triangle count when this crucial inequality holds.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides `x`, `y`, `z` such that `A <= x <= B <= y <= C <= z <= D`.\n\nThe conditions for a non-degenerate triangle with sides `x`, `y`, `z` are:\n1. `x + y > z`\n2. `x + z > y`\n3. `y + z > x`\n\nGiven the constraints `A <= x <= B`, `B <= y <= C`, `C <= z <= D`:\n- Since `z >= C` and `y <= C`, we have `z >= y`. Also, `x >= A >= 1`. Thus, `x + z > z >= y`, which means `x + z > y` is always true.\n- Since `y >= B` and `x <= B`, `y` can be greater than or equal to `x`. Also `z >= C >= B >= x`. Since `z >= 1`, `y + z > y >= x` is always true.\n\nTherefore, the only triangle inequality we need to check is `x + y > z`.\nCombining this with `z <= D`, we must have `z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nAlso, `z` must be at least `C`. So, `C <= z <= min(D, x + y - 1)`.\nFor a valid `z` to exist, we need `C <= min(D, x + y - 1)`, which implies `C <= D` (given) and `C <= x + y - 1`, or `x + y >= C + 1`.\n\nSo, we need to count integer triples `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1. `A <= x <= B`\n2. `B <= y <= C`\n3. `C <= z <= D`\n4. `x + y > z` (or equivalently, `x + y - 1 >= z`)\n\nFor fixed `x` and `y`, the number of possible `z` values is `max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)`.\nWe need to sum this quantity over all valid `x` and `y`.\n\nThe maximum possible sum `x+y` is `B+C`, and the minimum is `A+B`.\nLet `S = x + y`. The condition `x + y - 1 >= z` implies `x + y - 1 >= C`. So `S >= C + 1`.\nThe number of valid `z` for a given `S` is `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\nLet `count(S) = max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\nWe need to calculate `sum_{x=A to B} sum_{y=B to C} count(x+y)`.\n\nThe maximum value for `D` is `5 \\cdot 10^5`. A direct triple loop `x, y, z` would be too slow (`O(D^3)`). A double loop `x, y` would be `O(B \\cdot C)`, which can be `O(D^2)` and too slow (`(5 \\cdot 10^5)^2 = 2.5 \\cdot 10^{11}`).\nWe need a more efficient approach.\n\nWe can iterate over `x` from `A` to `B`. For each `x`, we iterate over `y` from `B` to `C`.\nFor each pair `(x, y)`, we calculate `S = x + y`.\nThe number of valid `z` values is `max(0, min(D, S - 1) - C + 1)`.\nThis expression for `z` can be simplified:\n- If `S - 1 < C`, then `min(D, S - 1) - C + 1 < C - C + 1 = 1`, so `count(S) = 0`. This is consistent with `x + y >= C + 1`.\n- If `S - 1 >= C`:\n    - If `S - 1 <= D`, then `count(S) = (S - 1) - C + 1 = S - C`.\n    - If `S - 1 > D`, then `count(S) = D - C + 1`.\n\nSo, for each `x` from `A` to `B`:\nFor each `y` from `B` to `C`:\nLet `S = x + y`.\nIf `S <= C`: The triangle inequality `x + y > z` cannot be satisfied for `z >= C`. So, 0 triangles.\nIf `S > C`:\n    The number of `z` values is `min(D, S - 1) - C + 1`.\n    Let `max_z = min(D, S - 1)`.\n    The number of `z` values is `max_z - C + 1`.\n\nThis is still `O(B \\cdot C)`. The maximum sum `x+y` is `B+C`. Let `M = B+C`.\nThe maximum value of `M` is `5 \\cdot 10^5 + 5 \\cdot 10^5 = 10^6`.\nWe can iterate `x` from `A` to `B`. For each `x`, we need to sum `count(x+y)` for `y` from `B` to `C`.\nThe sum `x+y` ranges from `x+B` to `x+C`.\nLet `k = x+y`. We are interested in `k` in the range `[x+B, x+C]`.\n\nNotice that `count(S)` is a piecewise linear function of `S`:\n- `count(S) = 0` for `S <= C`\n- `count(S) = S - C` for `C < S <= D + 1`\n- `count(S) = D - C + 1` for `S > D + 1`\n\nLet's precompute the frequency of sums `x+y`. This is not feasible directly due to `O(D^2)` pairs of `(x,y)`.\nInstead, let's iterate `x` from `A` to `B`.\nFor each `x`, `y` ranges from `B` to `C`.\nThe sum `S = x+y` ranges from `x+B` to `x+C`.\nWe need to calculate `sum_{y=B to C} count(x+y)`.\nThis is `sum_{S=x+B to x+C} count(S)`.\nThis is a sum over a range. We can use prefix sums for `count(S)`.\n\nLet `f[S] = count(S)`.\n`P[K] = sum_{S=1 to K} f[S]`.\nThen `sum_{S=x+B to x+C} f[S] = P[x+C] - P[x+B-1]`.\nThe maximum value for `S` is `B+C`, which can be `10^6`.\nWe can precompute `f[S]` and `P[K]` up to `B+C`.\nThe maximum value for `B+C` is `5 \\cdot 10^5 + 5 \\cdot 10^5 = 10^6`.\nPrecomputation of `f` takes `O(B+C)` time.\nPrecomputation of `P` takes `O(B+C)` time.\nThe final sum takes `O(B-A+1)` time.\nTotal time complexity: `O(B+C)`.\nSpace complexity: `O(B+C)`.\nGiven `B+C <= 10^6`, this is efficient enough.\n\nLet's define `f[S]` more concretely:\n`f[S] = 0` if `S <= C`.\n`f[S] = S - C` if `C < S <= D + 1`.\n`f[S] = D - C + 1` if `S > D + 1`.\n\nThe maximum possible sum `S = x+y` is `B+C`. So we need arrays up to index `B+C`.\nLet `max_sum = B + C`.\nInitialize `f` array of size `max_sum + 1` with zeros.\nInitialize `P` array of size `max_sum + 1` with zeros.\n\nFor `S` from `1` to `max_sum`:\n  If `S <= C`:\n    `f[S] = 0`\n  Else if `S <= D + 1`:\n    `f[S] = S - C`\n  Else: (`S > D + 1`)\n    `f[S] = D - C + 1`\n\nNow compute prefix sums `P`:\nFor `K` from `1` to `max_sum`:\n  `P[K] = P[K-1] + f[K]`\n\nFinally, calculate the total count:\n`total_triangles = 0`\nFor `x` from `A` to `B`:\n  `lower_S = x + B`\n  `upper_S = x + C`\n  `total_triangles += P[upper_S] - P[lower_S - 1]`\n\nExample: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4\nmax_sum = B+C = 2+3 = 5.\nf array (size 6):\nS=1: S <= C (1<=3) -> f[1]=0\nS=2: S <= C (2<=3) -> f[2]=0\nS=3: S <= C (3<=3) -> f[3]=0\nS=4: C < S <= D+1 (3<4<=5) -> f[4]=S-C = 4-3=1\nS=5: C < S <= D+1 (3<5<=5) -> f[5]=S-C = 5-3=2\n\nf = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2] (index 0 unused)\n\nP array (size 6):\nP[0]=0\nP[1]=P[0]+f[1]=0+0=0\nP[2]=P[1]+f[2]=0+0=0\nP[3]=P[2]+f[3]=0+0=0\nP[4]=P[3]+f[4]=0+1=1\nP[5]=P[4]+f[5]=1+2=3\n\nP = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3] (index 0 unused)\n\ntotal_triangles = 0\nx=A=1:\n  lower_S = x+B = 1+2 = 3\n  upper_S = x+C = 1+3 = 4\n  total_triangles += P[4] - P[3-1] = P[4] - P[2] = 1 - 0 = 1\nx=B=2:\n  lower_S = x+B = 2+2 = 4\n  upper_S = x+C = 2+3 = 5\n  total_triangles += P[5] - P[4-1] = P[5] - P[3] = 3 - 0 = 3\n\nTotal triangles = 1 + 3 = 4.
