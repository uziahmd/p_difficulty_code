Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Initial Thoughts:** I'm tackling a competitive programming problem where the goal is to count distinct sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding substrings of a binary string. This string grows over time with append operations, and we need to report the count after each change. The twist is that the answer needs to be modulo 10^9 + 7.  The problem involves decoding binary strings as Morse code, and the maximum length of a letter's code is four. There are some invalid codes we need to filter out. It seems like a dynamic programming approach might be useful.\n\n**Problem Breakdown:**  I need to efficiently identify valid Morse codes within the binary string and then count the unique letter sequences that can be derived from its substrings.  Initially, I thought of a brute-force approach, iterating over all substrings and calculating all the unique letter combinations.  However, with a string length potentially reaching 3000, that approach would be too slow (O(N^3)). I'm now focusing on a dynamic programming solution, considering a `dp` table to store sequence counts for prefixes.\n\n**Re-Evaluating the Counting:** The problem statement is crucial here. It asks for distinct sequences.  If the same sequence (\"TT\", for example) appears in multiple substrings, it should only be counted once.  My initial method of counting wasn't accounting for distinctness.  I'm now thinking of using a hash-based approach or a set to ensure unique sequence counting. I realized that a brute-force calculation is not feasible for the string length, as I will have to iterate over all possible substrings, which would lead to an O(N^3) time complexity.\n\n**Towards a Solution:** I realize I need to maintain a set of valid Morse codes. Then, for each new character appended to the string, efficiently calculate the new distinct sequences formed by the substrings ending at that character's position.  I'm exploring dynamic programming with hashing to identify new sequences or a similar strategy to ensure I only count unique sequences. I'm focusing on the number of distinct sequences. I'm thinking about how to efficiently track these distinct sequences as the string grows.  A potential solution path involves calculating the counts of distinct letter sequences formed by substrings, and summing them for each new append. I will explore using sets and hashing to store the intermediate sequences and avoid re-counting.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to count the number of *distinct* non-empty sequences of English letters that can be formed by decoding *any substring* of `S`. The string `S` grows by appending characters ('0' for dot, '1' for dash) one at a time, and we need to report the count after each modification. The final answer should be modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nLet's clarify the rules:\n1.  **Morse Code**: '0' for dot, '1' for dash.\n2.  **Letter Representation**: Each letter is represented by a binary string of length 1 to 4.\n3.  **Valid Codes**: There are 26 such valid codes, and each maps to a distinct English letter. The four invalid codes are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". All other 30 - 4 = 26 strings of length 1 to 4 are valid.\n\nThe core challenge is counting *distinct* sequences of letters. For example, if `S = \"11\"`, substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"11\".\n-   \"1\" decodes to 'T'.\n-   \"11\" decodes to 'M' or 'TT'.\nThe set of distinct sequences is {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\"}. The count is 3.\n\nSince `S` can grow up to length `M = 3000`, and a sequence can have up to `M` letters (e.g., \"00...0\" can be \"E\", \"EE\", \"EEE\", etc.), storing actual sequences of letters (strings) in a set would be too slow and memory-intensive. The number of distinct sequences can be very large.\n\nThe phrase \"print them modulo `10^9 + 7`\" suggests that we might be counting something that naturally results in large numbers, and the modulo operation is applied to this count. This is a common technique when counting *distinct* items using hashing. We can map each letter sequence to a numerical hash value. By using two hash functions (polynomial hashing with different bases and moduli), we can significantly reduce the probability of collisions. We store pairs of `(hash1, hash2)` in a global set and count its size.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Precompute Valid Codes and Mappings:**\n    Create a set `VALID_CODES` containing all 26 valid Morse code strings.\n    `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.\n    `HASH_MOD1 = 10^9 + 7`, `HASH_MOD2 = 10^9 + 9`.\n    `P1 = 31`, `P2 = 37` (prime bases for hashing).\n    We can assign an arbitrary integer value to each of the 26 English letters (e.g., 1 to 26).\n\n2.  **Hashing Sequences:**\n    A sequence of letters `L_1 L_2 ... L_k` can be hashed as `(L_1 * P^(k-1) + L_2 * P^(k-2) + ... + L_k * P^0) % HASH_MOD`.\n    We will use two hash functions for robustness: `(hash1, hash2)`.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Programming for Substrings:**\n    When a new character `c` is appended to `S`, its length becomes `N`. We need to consider all new substrings ending at index `N-1`: `S[0...N-1]`, `S[1...N-1]`, ..., `S[N-1...N-1]`.\n    For each such substring `S[j...N-1]`, we want to find all letter sequences it can form.\n    Let `dp[k]` be a list of `(hash1, hash2)` pairs representing all distinct sequences that can be formed from `S[k...N-1]`.\n    Initialize `dp[N]` with `[(0, 0)]` representing the empty sequence hash (or an empty list if we only store non-empty sequences and handle the initial letter differently). It's easier to handle empty sequence as `(0,0)` and filter it later.\n\n    Iterate `j` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    `dp[j]` will store the hash pairs for sequences formed from `S[j...N-1]`.\n    For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n        If `j + l <= N`:\n            Consider the Morse code `code = S[j...j+l-1]`.\n            If `code` is in `VALID_CODES`:\n                Let `letter_val` be the integer value of the letter corresponding to `code`.\n                For each `(h1, h2)` in `dp[j+l]`:\n                    Calculate new hash pairs:\n                    `new_h1 = (letter_val * P1^l_seq + h1) % HASH_MOD1`\n                    `new_h2 = (letter_val * P2^l_seq + h2) % HASH_MOD2`\n                    where `l_seq` is the length of the sequence corresponding to `(h1, h2)`.\n                    This is wrong. `P` should be raised to the power of the *length of the sequence being appended to*.\n                    Let `dp[k]` store tuples `(hash1, hash2, sequence_length)`.\n\n    Corrected DP for `dp[j]` for substring `S[j...N-1]`:\n    `dp[N] = [(0, 0, 0)]` (hash for empty string, length 0)\n    For `j` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n        `current_sequences_hashes = set()`\n        For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n            If `j + l <= N`:\n                `code = S[j...j+l-1]`\n                If `code` is in `VALID_CODES`:\n                    `letter_val = get_letter_value(code)` (e.g., 'A'->1, 'B'->2, etc.)\n                    For each `(h1_suffix, h2_suffix, len_suffix)` in `dp[j+l]`:\n                        `new_h1 = (letter_val * pow(P1, len_suffix, HASH_MOD1) + h1_suffix) % HASH_MOD1`\n                        `new_h2 = (letter_val * pow(P2, len_suffix, HASH_MOD2) + h2_suffix) % HASH_MOD2`\n                        If `len_suffix == 0`: (This means `letter_val` is the first/only letter in the sequence)\n                            `current_sequences_hashes.add((new_h1, new_h2, 1))`\n                        Else:\n                            `current_sequences_hashes.add((new_h1, new_h2, len_suffix + 1))`\n        `dp[j] = list(current_sequences_hashes)`\n        Add all `(h1, h2)` from `current_sequences_hashes` (excluding `(0,0)` if it means empty sequence) to a global `total_distinct_sequences_hashes` set.\n\n    The `pow(P, len_suffix, MOD)` calculation can be slow if `len_suffix` is large. We can precompute powers of `P1` and `P2`.\n    `P1_powers[k] = P1^k % HASH_MOD1`\n    `P2_powers[k] = P2^k % HASH_MOD2`\n\n    The `dp[j]` list can contain `O(4^4)` items in the worst case, as each `dp[j+l]` might have many items.\n    The maximum number of distinct sequences from a string of length `k` is `26^k`.\n    The maximum length of `S[j...N-1]` is `N`.\n    The number of sequences from `S[j...N-1]` can be large. Storing them in `dp[j]` as lists of hashes is too much.\n\n    Instead of `dp[j]` storing all sequences, `dp[j]` should store the *number* of sequences. This is what the example implies.\n    Let `dp[k]` be the number of non-empty sequences for `S[k...N-1]`.\n    `dp[N] = 0`\n    For `k` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n        `dp[k] = 0`\n        For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n            If `k + l <= N` and `S[k...k+l-1]` is a valid Morse code:\n                `dp[k] = (dp[k] + 1) % MOD` (for the single letter sequence formed by `S[k...k+l-1]`)\n                `dp[k] = (dp[k] + dp[k+l]) % MOD` (for sequences starting with `S[k...k+l-1]` followed by sequences from `S[k+l...N-1]`)\n    The sum of `dp[k]` for `k=0...N-1` would be `sum(count_sequences(S[k...N-1]))`. This is what I initially thought.\n    But this is not counting distinct sequences.\n\nLet's re-examine the example:\n`S = \"1\"`, output `1`.\n`S = \"11\"`, output `3`.\n`S = \"111\"`, output `7`.\n\nThis sequence `1, 3, 7, ...` looks like `2^k - 1`.\nIf `S` consists of only '1's:\n`S = \"1\"`: \"T\" (1)\n`S = \"11\"`: \"T\", \"M\", \"TT\" (3)\n`S = \"111\"`: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" (7)\nThe sequences are formed by valid codes \"1\", \"11\", \"111\".\n\"1\" -> T\n\"11\" -> M\n\"111\" -> O\nFor `S = \"111\"`, substrings are:\n\"1\" (at index 0): \"T\"\n\"11\" (at index 0): \"M\", \"TT\"\n\"111\" (at index 0): \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\"1\" (at index 1): \"T\" (already seen)\n\"11\" (at index 1): \"M\", \"TT\" (already seen)\n\"1\" (at index 2): \"T\" (already seen)\nTotal distinct sequences: {\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}. Count is 7.\n\nThis suggests that for a given ending position `N-1`, we need to find all distinct sequences that can be formed by `S[j...N-1]` for `j=0...N-1`, and add them to the global set.\n\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4. This means `dp[j]` only depends on `dp[j+1], dp[j+2], dp[j+3], dp[j+4]`.\nWe can use a rolling hash approach.\nLet `global_hashes` be a set of `(h1, h2)` pairs.\nWhen `c` is appended to `S` (current length `N-1` becomes `N`):\n`current_S_list` = `S` as a list of chars.\n`dp_hashes = [set() for _ in range(N + 1)]`\n`dp_hashes[N] = {(0, 0)}` (empty sequence hash)\n\nFor `j` from `N-1` down to `0`:\n    For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n        If `j + l <= N`:\n            `code = \"\".join(current_S_list[j : j+l])`\n            If `code` in `VALID_CODES_MAP`:\n                `letter_val = VALID_CODES_MAP[code]`\n                For `h_suffix, h_len_suffix` in `dp_hashes[j+l]`:\n                    `h1_new = (letter_val * P1_powers[h_len_suffix] + h_suffix[0]) % HASH_MOD1`\n                    `h2_new = (letter_val * P2_powers[h_len_suffix] + h_suffix[1]) % HASH_MOD2`\n                    `new_seq_len = h_len_suffix + 1`\n                    `dp_hashes[j].add(((h1_new, h2_new), new_seq_len))`\n                    `global_hashes.add((h1_new, h2_new))`\n\nThe `dp_hashes[j]` storing `((h1,h2), length)` is still problematic because `dp_hashes[j]` can contain many elements.\nHowever, the total number of distinct hash pairs is what matters, not the intermediate `dp_hashes[j]` sizes.\nThe total number of hash pairs added to `global_hashes` over all `M` operations is the answer.\nThe maximum size of `global_hashes` is `M * N * 4` (roughly `M^2` distinct sequences from each substring, max length 4).\nNo, it's `M * (sum of sequences from new substrings)`.\nThe sum of `|dp_hashes[j]|` over all `j` is the problem.\nIf `|dp_hashes[j]|` can be `O(M)`, then `O(M * 4 * M)` is `O(M^2)` states for `dp_hashes`.\n`M=3000`, `M^2 = 9*10^6`. Each state `((h1,h2), len)` is small.\nThe number of distinct sequences generated by `S[j...N-1]` for all `j` can be `O(M)`.\nFor example, `S = \"0000...\"`.\n`S[N-1...N-1]` is \"0\" -> E.\n`S[N-2...N-1]` is \"00\" -> I, EE.\n`S[N-3...N-1]` is \"000\" -> S, IE, EI, EEE.\n`S[N-4...N-1]` is \"0000\" -> H, SE, EH, II, EIE, IEE, EEEI, EEIE, EIEE, EEEE.\nThe number of distinct sequences from a substring of length `k` can be exponential in `k`.\nFor `k=4`, `26^4` distinct sequences.\nThe number of sequences from a length `L` string `X` is roughly `fib(L)`.\nFor `L=3000`, `fib(3000)` is huge.\nThis means `dp_hashes[j]` can contain many elements.\n\nThe problem statement \"modulo `10^9 + 7`\" for the final count strongly implies that we don't need to count distinct *hash pairs*, but rather count *something else* that sums up.\nWhat if `total_ans = sum_{0 <= i <= j < N} (number of distinct sequences from S[i...j])`?\nFor `S=\"111\"`, `N=3`:\n`S[0...0]` = \"1\": \"T\" (1)\n`S[1...1]` = \"1\": \"T\" (1)\n`S[2...2]` = \"1\": \"T\" (1)\n`S[0...1]` = \"11\": \"M\", \"TT\" (2)\n`S[1...2]` = \"11\": \"M\", \"TT\" (2)\n`S[0...2]` = \"111\": \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\" (4)\nSum = `1+1+1+2+2+4 = 11`. Still not 7.\n\nThe only way to get 7 for \"111\" is by counting distinct sequences in the union of all sets.\nUnion of `{\"T\"}`, `{\"T\"}`, `{\"T\"}`, `{\"M\", \"TT\"}`, `{\"M\", \"TT\"}`, `{\"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}`.\n`Union = {\"T\", \"M\", \"TT\", \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"}`. Size 7.\n\nThis confirms the hashing approach is correct. The issue is the size of `dp_hashes[j]`.\nThe key observation for this type of problem with `M=3000` is usually that the \"effective\" length of sequences is small, or the number of *distinct* sequences is small.\nThe maximum length of a Morse code is 4. This means `S[j...N-1]` can only form sequences that start with codes of length 1, 2, 3, or 4.\nThis means `dp_hashes[j]` only depends on `dp_hashes[j+1], ..., dp_hashes[j+4]`.\nWe can optimize the `dp_hashes` structure.\nInstead of storing `dp_hashes[j]`, we can maintain a `set` of `(hash1, hash2, length)` tuples for the last 4 positions.\nLet `active_sequences[k]` be the set of `(hash1, hash2, length)` for sequences that can be formed from `S[N-1-k ... N-1]`.\n`k` ranges from `0` to `N-1`.\nWhen a new character `c` is appended, `S` becomes `S + c`. Let `N` be the new length.\nWe are interested in substrings `S[j...N-1]` for `j = 0...N-1`.\nLet `dp_current_suffix_hashes` be a list of `4` sets. `dp_current_suffix_hashes[k]` will store `(hash1, hash2, length)` tuples for sequences that can be formed from `S[N-1-k ... N-1]`.\n`N` is the length of the string `S`.\nThe current string is `S_str`.\n`dp = [set() for _ in range(5)]`\n`dp[0]` will represent sequences from `S[N...N-1]` (empty string). `dp[0] = {((0,0), 0)}`.\nFor `k` from `1` to `N`: (current suffix starts at `N-k`)\n    `current_dp_set = set()`\n    `current_char_idx = N - k`\n    For `l` from `1` to `4`:\n        If `current_char_idx + l <= N`:\n            `code = S_str[current_char_idx : current_char_idx + l]`\n            If `code` in `VALID_CODES_MAP`:\n                `letter_val = VALID_CODES_MAP[code]`\n                For `(h_suffix, h_len_suffix)` in `dp[k-l]`: (This is wrong, it should be `dp[l_code_len]` for `S[N-1-k+l_code_len ... N-1]`)\n                This is a sliding window DP.\n\nLet `dp[k]` be the set of `(hash1, hash2, length)` for sequences that can be formed from `S[N-k ... N-1]`.\n`dp[0] = {((0,0), 0)}` (empty sequence)\nFor `k` from `1` to `N`:\n    `dp[k] = set()`\n    For `l` from `1` to `min(k, 4)`:\n        `code = S_str[N-k : N-k+l]`\n        If `code` in `VALID_CODES_MAP`:\n            `letter_val = VALID_CODES_MAP[code]`\n            For `(h_suffix, h_len_suffix)` in `dp[k-l]`:\n                `h1_new = (letter_val * P1_powers[h_len_suffix] + h_suffix[0]) % HASH_MOD1`\n                `h2_new = (letter_val * P2_powers[h_len_suffix] + h_suffix[1]) % HASH_MOD2`\n                `new_seq_len = h_len_suffix + 1`\n                `dp[k].add(((h1_new, h2_new), new_seq_len))`\n                `global_hashes.add((h1_new, h2_new))`\n\nThe `dp` array here has `N` elements, each storing a set of hash tuples. The maximum size of each set `dp[k]` can be large.\nThe total number of distinct sequences that can be formed from a string of length `L` is `F_L`, where `F_L` is the `L`-th Fibonacci number if all length 1 codes are valid. With length 1-4 codes, it's a generalized Fibonacci sequence. This can be huge.\n\nThe key must be that the number of *distinct* sequences is small.\nThe example `S=\"111\"`, output `7`.\n`S=\"1111\"`. Substrings:\n\"1\": \"T\"\n\"11\": \"M\", \"TT\"\n\"111\": \"O\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\"1111\": \"P\", \"OM\", \"OT\", \"M M\", \"MTT\", \"T O\", \"T M T\", \"T T T T\"\n(assuming \"1111\" -> P)\nThe distinct sequences for `S=\"1111\"` would be 15. (`2^4 - 1`).\nThis pattern `2^N - 1` holds if all substrings `S[i...j]` are composed of only '1's, and all \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", \"1111\" are valid codes.\nIn this case, the number of distinct sequences from `S[i...j]` (all '1's) is `2^(j-i+1) - 1`.\nThe total distinct sequences is `2^N - 1`.\n\nThis pattern `2^N - 1` is observed in the first sample.\n`N=1`: `2^1-1 = 1`\n`N=2`: `2^2-1 = 3`\n`N=3`: `2^3-1 = 7`\nThe example output for `S=\"111\"` is 7. This matches `2^N - 1`.\nThis means that for `S` consisting only of '1's, the answer is `2^N - 1`.\nThis implies that the total number of distinct sequences is not excessively large.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences for `M=3000` is `2^3000 - 1` (if `S` is all '1's). This is huge.\nBut we are taking modulo `10^9 + 7`.\nThis means the count `X` is `X % (10^9 + 7)`.\nThis is exactly why we use hashing. The count of distinct hash pairs `(h1, h2)` is the answer.\n\nThe number of distinct hash pairs `(h1, h2)` for `S[N-k ... N-1]` (i.e. `dp[k]`) cannot be too large.\nIf it were, the `M^2` complexity would be too slow.\nThe maximum number of distinct sequences from a string of length `L` using codes of length up to `4` is limited.\nFor `L=1`, 1 sequence.\nFor `L=2`, \"00\" -> I, EE (2 sequences)\nFor `L=3`, \"000\" -> S, IE, EI, EEE (4 sequences)\nFor `L=4`, \"0000\" -> H, SE, EH, II, EIE, IEE, EEEI, EEIE, EIEE, EEEE (10 sequences)\nFor `L=5`, \"00000\" -> EEEII, EIEIE, EIEEE, ... (20 sequences)\nThis is `a_k = a_{k-1} + a_{k-2} + a_{k-3} + a_{k-4}`.\n`a_0=1` (empty string), `a_1=1`, `a_2=2`, `a_3=4`, `a_4=8`.\nThese are `a_k` distinct sequences of letters formed from `0...0` of length `k`.\nThis is `2^(k-1)` for `k>=1` if \"0\", \"00\", \"000\", \"0000\" are all valid.\nThe number of distinct sequences from `S[N-k ... N-1]` can be up to `2^k`.\nSo `dp[k]` can have `O(2^k)` elements.\nThe maximum `k` is `N=3000`. So `dp[k]` can be huge.\nThis implies the `O(M^2)` solution is too slow if `dp[k]` grows exponentially.\n\nThe only way `M^2` works is if `|dp[k]|` is bounded by a small constant, or `log(M)`.\nThe number of distinct sequences from a suffix `S[j...N-1]` is not necessarily small.\nHowever, `j` only goes back 4 positions for the DP recurrence.\n`dp[k]` is the set of hashes for `S[N-k...N-1]`.\n`dp[k]` depends on `dp[k-1], dp[k-2], dp[k-3], dp[k-4]`.\nSo, we only need to store `dp[k-1], dp[k-2], dp[k-3], dp[k-4]` to compute `dp[k]`.\nThis means we only need to store 4 sets of hashes.\n`current_sets = [set() for _ in range(4)]`\n`current_sets[0]` for `S[N-1...N-1]`\n`current_sets[1]` for `S[N-2...N-1]`\n`current_sets[2]` for `S[N-3...N-1]`\n`current_sets[3]` for `S[N-4...N-1]`\n\nWhen a new char `c` is appended to `S` (length `N-1` becomes `N`):\n`S_str` is the full string of length `N`.\n`new_dp_set = set()` (for `S[N-1...N-1]`)\n`code = S_str[N-1]`\nIf `code` in `VALID_CODES_MAP`:\n    `letter_val = VALID_CODES_MAP[code]`\n    `new_hash = ((letter_val, letter_val), 1)`\n    `new_dp_set.add(new_hash)`\n    `global_hashes.add((letter_val, letter_val))`\n\nNow, `new_dp_set` is `current_sets[0]` for the new `N`.\nWe need to update `current_sets[0]` to `current_sets[1]`, etc.\nThis is incorrect. `dp[k]` represents sequences from `S[N-k...N-1]`.\nWhen `N` increases by 1, `S[N-k...N-1]` becomes `S'[N+1-k...N]`.\nThis is exactly the string `S[N-k...N-1] + new_char`.\nThis means the entire DP needs to be recalculated from scratch for each `N`.\nNo, that's not right. `S[j...N-1]` means suffix of the current string `S`.\nWhen we append `c`, the new string is `S' = S + c`.

This is too slow.\n`3.6 * 10^8` operations is too much for 1-2 seconds time limit. Usually `10^8` is the limit.\n\nThe only way `O(M^2)` works is if `K_avg` is very small, like 1.\nThis implies that `dp_val[j+l]` contains very few elements.\nThis means that for `S[k...N-1]`, there are very few *distinct* sequences.\nThis is true if `N-k` is small (e.g., `N-k <= 4`).\nBut `N-k` can be `N`.\n\nThis problem is very hard. I suspect there's a trick related to the small length of Morse codes (at most 4).\nThis implies that `dp_val[j]` only needs to store sequences whose *binary representation* is short.\nA sequence `L_1 L_2 ...

C_k` must be `S[a...b]` for some `a,b`.\nThe maximum length of `S[a...b]` is 3000.\nSo `4k <= 3000`, `k <= 750`.\nSo maximum length of a sequence of letters is 750.\nThis is still too large. `26^750` is huge.\n\nThe constraint `l` from `1` to `4` is the key.\nThis means that `dp_val[j]` can be defined as a map from `(h1, h2)` to `(length_of_sequence_in_letters, last_4_chars_of_sequence_in_binary)`.\nThe last 4 chars in binary is `S[j...j+l-1]`.\nThis is a standard Aho-Corasick type problem.\nThe \"alphabet\" is 26 letters.\nThe \"words\" are sequences of letters.\nWe need to count distinct \"words\" (sequences of letters).\nThe total number of distinct strings of length up to `M` that can be formed from a 26-letter alphabet is `26^1 + ... + 26^M`.\nThis is definitely too large.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that the number of distinct hash pairs is indeed small.\nIf `M=3000`, and `N=3000`.\n`S[0...2999]` is `N` length.\n`dp_val[j]` is for `S[j...N-1]`.\n`dp_val[j]` is a set of `(hash, length)` tuples.\n`dp_val[j]` depends on `dp_val[j+1]` to `dp_val[j+4]`.\nThe size of `dp_val[j]` is `sum_{l=1}^4 (size of dp_val[j+l])`.

For `S=\"0000\"`, it forms 10 distinct sequences.\nFor `S=\"00000\"`, it forms 20 distinct sequences.\nThis is `a_k = a_{k-1} + a_{k-2} + a_{k-3} + a_{k-4}`.\n`a_0=1`, `a_1=1`, `a_2=2`, `a_3=4`, `a_4=8`, `a_5=15`, `a_6=29`, `a_7=56`, `a_8=108`, `a_9=208`, `a_10=401`.\nThe number of distinct sequences grows exponentially.\nSo `dp_val[j]` size is exponential in `N-j`.\nThe `O(M^2)` solution is incorrect.\n\nMy initial interpretation of `sum(count_sequences(S[i...j]))` resulting in `11` for `S=\"111\"` vs example `7` is the critical point.\nThe problem statement and example are consistent with counting distinct sequences.\nThe only way to count distinct sequences is with hashing.\nThe only way hashing works for `M=3000` is if the number of distinct sequences is bounded by a small number.\nThis is not true as shown by `S=\"00...0\"`.\n\nThis is a hard problem. I will implement the hashing solution and hope the actual test cases don't hit the worst-case exponential growth. The constraint `l` up to 4 is the crucial part.\nThe `dp_val[j]` should contain only `(hash1, hash2, length_of_sequence)`\nThe `length_of_sequence` is important for `P_powers`.\n`P1_powers` and `P2_powers` up to length `M` (3000) are needed.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Precompute valid Morse codes and their arbitrary integer values\nVALID_CODES_MAP = {}\nINVALID_CODES = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\nletter_idx = 1 # Start from 1 to avoid hash collision with (0,0) for empty sequence\n\nfor length in range(1, 5):\n    for i in range(2**length):\n        code = bin(i)[2:].zfill(length)\n        if code not in INVALID_CODES:\n            VALID_CODES_MAP[code] = letter_idx\n            letter_idx += 1\n\n# Modulo for answer\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Moduli and bases for polynomial hashing\nHASH_MOD1 = 10**9 + 7\nHASH_MOD2 = 10**9 + 9\nP1 = 31\nP2 = 37\n\n# Precompute powers of P1 and P2\n# Max sequence length is M (3000), so we need powers up to M\nMAX_M = 3000\nP1_powers = [1] * (MAX_M + 1)\nP2_powers = [1] * (MAX_M + 1)\n\nfor i in range(1, MAX_M + 1):\n    P1_powers[i] = (P1_powers[i-1] * P1) % HASH_MOD1\n    P2_powers[i] = (P2_powers[i-1] * P2) % HASH_MOD2\n\n# S string as a list of characters\nS_list = []\n# Global set to store distinct sequence hash pairs (h1, h2)\nglobal_distinct_hashes = set()\n\nm = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    char = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    S_list.append(char)\n    N = len(S_list)\n\n    # dp_val[j] stores a set of ((hash1, hash2), sequence_length) tuples\n    # for sequences formed from S_list[j : N]\n    # The length of a sequence is in terms of letters, not binary code length.\n    dp_val = [set() for _ in range(N + 1)]\n    \n    # Base case: empty sequence at the end of the string\n    # We use (0,0) for hash and 0 for length to represent an empty sequence.\n    dp_val[N].add(((0, 0), 0))\n\n    # Iterate backwards from N-1 down to 0\n    for j in range(N - 1, -1, -1):\n        # Check for Morse codes of length 1 to 4 starting at j\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if j + l <= N: # Check if the code fits within the string\n                code = \"\".join(S_list[j : j+l])\n                if code in VALID_CODES_MAP:\n                    letter_val = VALID_CODES_MAP[code]\n                    \n                    # For each sequence that can be formed from S_list[j+l : N]\n                    # (which are stored in dp_val[j+l])\n                    for (h_suffix, h_len_suffix) in dp_val[j+l]:\n                        h1_suffix, h2_suffix = h_suffix\n                        \n                        # Calculate new hash for the sequence:\n                        # (current_letter + suffix_sequence)\n                        # new_h = (letter_val * P_power[h_len_suffix] + h_suffix) % HASH_MOD\n                        \n                        h1_new = (letter_val * P1_powers[h_len_suffix] + h1_suffix) % HASH_MOD1\n                        h2_new = (letter_val * P2_powers[h_len_suffix] + h2_suffix) % HASH_MOD2\n                        \n                        new_seq_len = h_len_suffix + 1\n                        \n                        # Add the new sequence's hash and length to dp_val[j]\n                        dp_val[j].add(((h1_new, h2_new), new_seq_len))\n                        \n                        # Add the new sequence's hash pair to the global set\n                        # Only add if it's a non-empty sequence (length > 0)\n                        if new_seq_len > 0:\n                            global_distinct_hashes.add((h1_new, h2_new))\n    \n    # Print the total count of distinct sequences modulo MOD\n    sys.stdout.write(str(len(global_distinct_hashes) % MOD) + '\\n')\n\n```",
