            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this competitive programming problem:**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to write a script that figures out the minimum extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to make a \"mentsu\" (either a triplet or a sequence) from her initial three tiles. I've got to analyze the input (three tile strings) and output the smallest number of draws required (0, 1, or 2).  Let's break down these \"mentsu\" definitions... A koutsu is easy - three identical tiles. A shuntsu means three sequential numbered tiles of the same suit.\n\nThinking through it, I realize the maximum number of draws she'd need is two. If she *needs* 3 of a kind, she can just draw 2 of them to have a koutsu.  But let's look at 0 and 1 draws carefully.\n\nWith *zero* draws, she already has a \"mentsu\" so we just need to confirm if these three tiles are identical (koutsu) or sequential of the same suit (shuntsu). That's simple enough - checking for identical tiles and sorting numbers for the shuntsu check.\n\nIf zero draws don't work, *one* draw needs to be enough. This means she must have 4 tiles and from these 4 tiles, we need to be able to make a \"mentsu\".  So, out of her original 3 tiles, if any two are identical, drawing that same tile guarantees a koutsu. Or, there might be *some* pair of tiles from the original three that are close enough to complete a shuntsu with one more draw - this is the trickiest part.\n\nSo, for one draw, I need to check every *possible pair* from the initial three tiles. If any two are identical, she can draw that tile and make a koutsu.  If they have the same suit, if the numbers differ by 1 (e.g., 2m and 3m), drawing the missing one completes the shuntsu. If the numbers differ by 2 (e.g., 1m and 3m), draw the middle tile.\n\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw works, she *must* need two draws. This can always work because she can always draw two of the same tile to make a koutsu out of her 5 total tiles.\n\nOkay, let's represent the tiles as (number, suit) tuples to make comparison easier.\n\nI'm starting to think about data structures.  The input's string format (e.g. \"1m 2p 3s\") needs to be converted into this tuple format. I'll need to do some sorting, specifically within the numbers of the same suit for the shuntsu check.\n\nI need a clear function. Check for zero draws first. If no zero, check for 1 draw. If that fails, the answer is 2. The key is clearly the 1 draw check - making sure I handle all the koutsu/shuntsu possibilities in the most concise way possible.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be a koutsu (triplet of three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit). She starts with three tiles and can draw any tiles she wants. The maximum number of draws will be 2, as she can always form a mentsu with 2 draws (e.g., draw two tiles identical to one she already has to form a koutsu).\n\nWe need to check for 0, then 1, then finally 2 draws.\n\nLet the three initial tiles be `T1, T2, T3`. Each tile can be represented as a `(number, suit)` tuple, e.g., '1s' becomes `(1, 's')`.\n\n**Step 1: Check for 0 draws**\nThis means Tokitsukaze already has a mentsu with her initial three tiles.\n1.  **Koutsu check**: Are all three tiles `T1, T2, T3` identical?\n    If `T1 == T2` and `T2 == T3`, then she has a koutsu.\n2.  **Shuntsu check**:\n    *   Are all three tiles of the same suit (`T1[1] == T2[1]` and `T2[1] == T3[1]`)?\n    *   If so, get their numbers: `n1, n2, n3 = sorted([T1[0], T2[0], T3[0]])`.\n    *   Check if they form a sequence: `n2 == n1 + 1` and `n3 == n2 + 1`.\nIf either of these conditions is met, the answer is 0.\n\n**Step 2: Check for 1 draw**\nIf 0 draws is not possible, we check if she can form a mentsu by drawing one additional tile. This means that among her initial three tiles, there must be a pair of tiles `(Ta, Tb)` that, with one specific drawn tile, can form a mentsu.\nWe iterate through all unique pairs of tiles from `(T1, T2, T3)`: `(T1, T2)`, `(T1, T3)`, and `(T2, T3)`. For each pair `(Ta, Tb)`:\n1.  **Koutsu potential**: If `Ta == Tb`, she has two identical tiles. She can draw a third tile identical to `Ta` (e.g., if she has '1m', '1m', she can draw another '1m') to form a koutsu.\n2.  **Shuntsu potential**: If `Ta[1] == Tb[1]` (same suit):\n    *   Let `na, nb = sorted([Ta[0], Tb[0]])`.\n    *   If `nb == na + 1` (e.g., `(1,'m'), (2,'m')`): She can draw `na - 1` (if `na > 1`, e.g., for `(2,'m'), (3,'m')` draw `1m`) or `nb + 1` (if `nb < 9`, e.g., for `(1,'m'), (2,'m')` draw `3m`). In any case, at least one of these options will be a valid tile (number 1-9), completing a shuntsu.\n    *   If `nb == na + 2` (e.g., `(1,'m'), (3,'m')`): She can draw `na + 1` (e.g., for `(1,'m'), (3,'m')` draw `2m`). This will always be a valid tile number (2-8), completing a shuntsu.\nIf any of these conditions are met for any pair, the answer is 1.\n\n**Step 3: If neither 0 nor 1 draw, then 2 draws**\nIf the conditions for 0 or 1 draw are not met, then 2 draws are required. She can always draw two tiles identical to one of her existing tiles to form a koutsu (e.g., if she has `T1, T2, T3`, she can draw `T1, T1` to form a koutsu `[T1, T1, T1]`).\n\nThe provided solution implements this logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    line = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n    \n    tiles_raw = []\n    for s in line:\n        num = int(s[0])\n        suit = s[1]\n        tiles_raw.append((num, suit))\n    \n    t1, t2, t3 = tiles_raw[0], tiles_raw[1], tiles_raw[2]\n\n    # --- Check for 0 draws ---\n    # Koutsu: three identical tiles\n    if t1 == t2 and t2 == t3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Shuntsu: three sequential tiles of the same suit\n    if t1[1] == t2[1] and t2[1] == t3[1]: # All suits are the same\n        nums = sorted([t1[0], t2[0], t3[0]])\n        if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # --- Check for 1 draw ---\n    # Store tiles in a list for easier iteration over pairs\n    tiles = [t1, t2, t3]\n\n    # Check for koutsu potential (two identical tiles)\n    # If any two tiles are identical, drawing a third identical tile forms a koutsu.\n    if t1 == t2 or t1 == t3 or t2 == t3:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Check for shuntsu potential (two tiles of the same suit that are part of a sequence)\n    # Iterate over all possible unique pairs (i, j)\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(i + 1, 3):\n            tile_a = tiles[i]\n            tile_b = tiles[j]\n\n            if tile_a[1] == tile_b[1]: # Same suit\n                num_a, num_b = sorted([tile_a[0], tile_b[0]])\n                \n                # Case 1: numbers are x, x+1 (e.g., 1m, 2m)\n                # Can draw x-1 (if x > 1) or x+2 (if x < 8) to complete a shuntsu.\n                # At least one of these will always be a valid number (1-9).\n                if num_b == num_a + 1:\n                    print(1)\n                    return\n                \n                # Case 2: numbers are x, x+2 (e.g., 1m, 3m)\n                # Can draw x+1 (e.g., 2m) to complete a shuntsu.\n                # num_a+1 will always be a valid number (2-8).\n                if num_b == num_a + 2:\n                    print(1)\n                    return\n\n    # --- If neither 0 nor 1 draw, then 2 draws are needed ---\n    print(2)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
