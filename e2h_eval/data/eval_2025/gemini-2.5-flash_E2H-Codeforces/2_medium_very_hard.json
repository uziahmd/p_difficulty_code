Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for \"X\" Shape Grid Detection**\n\nI'm tackling a problem where I need to determine if a character grid forms an \"X\" shape based on specific rules. The rules are pretty straightforward: the characters along both diagonals must be identical, and all other characters (those not on the diagonals) must also be identical, but different from the diagonal characters. The grid's size, *n*, is always odd.\n\nMy strategy involves a straightforward approach. First, I'll read the grid's dimensions and the character data itself. I'm going to initialize two key variables: `diagonal_char` to store the character found on the diagonals, and `non_diagonal_char` to hold the character found off the diagonals. I'll iterate through each cell of the grid using nested loops. During this iteration, for each grid position `(i, j)`, I'll check if the cell falls on either of the two diagonals. If it is, I compare it to `diagonal_char`; if they don't match or `diagonal_char` is uninitialized, I immediately print \"NO\" and exit. If the cell is *not* on a diagonal, I'll do the same but compare against `non_diagonal_char`. The moment I find a discrepancy, I declare \"NO\" and quit.\n\nIf the entire grid is scanned without any violations, I have one last check: the `diagonal_char` and `non_diagonal_char` must be different. If they're equal, it means there was a character mismatch, and I print \"NO\". Otherwise, it's a valid \"X\" shape, and I output \"YES\".\n\nGiven the constraint that `n` is odd and greater than or equal to 3, both diagonal and non-diagonal characters are guaranteed to exist, which simplifies error-handling for those initializations. I'm choosing to write my code in Python using `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` for input/output efficiency, as it's common practice in competitive programming. I've designed this to be an *O*(*n*<sup>2</sup>) algorithm, since I have to examine each cell of the *n* x *n* grid.\n\nI ran a few test cases and double checked against the rules, and it all checks out. I'm confident in this solution.\n",
