Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the Array Stabilization Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Array Stabilization\" problem. It's pretty straightforward, but I need to be efficient.  Essentially, I'm given an array, and I need to remove one element to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the remaining array – the \"instability\".\n\nFirst, I understand the input is an array of integers, and the size is constrained. The key is that removing any other element than the max or min will not affect the end result, as it keeps both in play.\n\nThe crucial insight is that I can *sort* the array to make things easier. Then, the minimum instability will come from either removing the initial smallest element or the initial largest element.\n\nIf I remove the smallest element, my new minimum will be the second smallest, and the maximum will stay the same.  If I remove the largest element, my maximum will become the second largest, and the minimum will stay the same.  So, I just need to compute both of these differences – `(second largest - smallest)` and `(largest - second smallest)` – and choose the smaller one. That's my answer!  It's a simple, O(n log n) solution using sorting.\n",
