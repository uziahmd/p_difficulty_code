    "thought": "**Solving the Factorial Zeroes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem where I need to figure out how many numbers `n` exist such that `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The output should be the count and then the list of those `n` values.  \n\nFirst, I need to understand how to count those trailing zeroes in `n!`.  It's all about factors of 10, which come from pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization. Since there are always more 2s than 5s, the number of zeroes is just the number of 5s. Legendre's formula is perfect for this! It's  `Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...` – this goes on until the denominator is larger than `n`.\n\nNow,  `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. It increases, but only when `n` is a multiple of 5. It jumps by one for every multiple of 5, more when multiples of 25, 125 and so on. Basically, `Z(n)` increases by a value equal to the number of times 5 divides into the number `n`.  My goal is to find those `n` values where `Z(n)` exactly equals `m`.\n\nIf I find an `n_0` where `Z(n_0) = m`, it looks like the next four numbers will also have `Z(n)` as `m`, as long as `n_0` isn't a multiple of 5. Actually, if `n_0` is the smallest number where `Z(n) = m`, then the pattern will consistently produce 5 sequential values of `n` that will result in the same trailing zeroes.  \n\nSince `Z(n)` is non-decreasing, binary search is the way to go to find the right `n`. I can establish an upper bound by using the fact that the expected value `n/4`. An upper bound of `5 * m` seems safe enough.  I can find the smallest `n_0` such that `Z(n_0) >= m`.\n\nI will use my custom `count_trailing_zeroes` function, which efficiently uses the logic from Legendre's Formula. Then, if I get an `n_0` for which `Z(n_0)` is exactly `m`, I know the solutions are the `n_0`, `n_0+1`, `n_0+2`, `n_0+3`, `n_0+4`. If `Z(n_0)` is greater than `m`, it means that there are no solutions.\n\nThis logic makes use of the fact that if a value of `m` is present, it will always be for a sequence of 5 values of `n`.\n\nA bunch of testing shows it's working properly, accounting for edge cases and the fact that `m` always starts at 1 in this problem.  I'm confident this Python script is the right solution!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all positive integers `n` such that `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. We need to output the count of such `n`'s and then list them in increasing order.\n\n**Understanding Trailing Zeroes in Factorials**\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since `10 = 2 * 5`, we need to count the number of pairs of 2 and 5. In any factorial `n!`, the number of factors of 2 is always greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` is simply the total count of factors of 5 in its prime factorization.\n\nLegendre's formula provides this count:\n`Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...`\nThis sum continues as long as the denominator is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n**Properties of Z(n)**\n\n1.  `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function. As `n` increases, `Z(n)` either stays the same or increases.\n2.  `Z(n)` only increases when `n` is a multiple of 5. Specifically, `Z(n+1) - Z(n)` is equal to the number of factors of 5 in `n+1` (denoted `v_5(n+1)`).\n    *   For example: `Z(4)=0`, `Z(5)=1`. `Z(5)-Z(4) = 1 = v_5(5)`.\n    *   `Z(9)=1`, `Z(10)=2`. `Z(10)-Z(9) = 1 = v_5(10)`.\n    *   `Z(24)=4`, `Z(25)=6`. `Z(25)-Z(24) = 2 = v_5(25)`.\n\n**Finding Solutions for a Given `m`**\n\nLet's consider the sequence of `Z(n)` values:\n`Z(1)=0, Z(2)=0, Z(3)=0, Z(4)=0`\n`Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1`\n`Z(10)=2, Z(11)=2, ..., Z(14)=2`\n`Z(15)=3, ..., Z(19)=3`\n`Z(20)=4, ..., Z(24)=4`\n`Z(25)=6, ..., Z(29)=6` (Note the jump from 4 to 6, skipping 5)\n\nFrom this pattern, we can observe:\n*   If `m` is an achievable number of zeroes (e.g., `m=1`, `m=2`, `m=3`, `m=4`, `m=6`), then there are exactly 5 consecutive values of `n` for which `Z(n) = m`.\n*   If `m` is not an achievable number of zeroes (e.g., `m=5`), then there are 0 values of `n`.\n\nLet `n_0` be the *smallest* positive integer such that `Z(n_0) = m`.\nSince `m >= 1` (given in constraints), `Z(n_0)` must be positive. This implies `n_0` must be a multiple of 5.\n*   Proof: Assume `n_0` is not a multiple of 5. Then `n_0-1` is also not a multiple of 5 (unless `n_0` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, but `Z(n_0)=m>=1` implies `n_0 >= 5`). If `n_0` is not a multiple of 5, then `v_5(n_0) = 0`. This means `Z(n_0) - Z(n_0-1) = v_5(n_0) = 0`, so `Z(n_0-1) = Z(n_0) = m`. This contradicts `n_0` being the *smallest* integer for which `Z(n_0)=m`. Therefore, `n_0` must be a multiple of 5.\n\nIf `n_0` is a multiple of 5 and `Z(n_0) = m`:\n*   `Z(n_0+1) = Z(n_0) = m` (since `n_0+1` is not a multiple of 5)\n*   `Z(n_0+2) = Z(n_0) = m` (since `n_0+2` is not a multiple of 5)\n*   `Z(n_0+3) = Z(n_0) = m` (since `n_0+3` is not a multiple of 5)\n*   `Z(n_0+4) = Z(n_0) = m` (since `n_0+4` is not a multiple of 5)\n*   `Z(n_0+5)` will be `Z(n_0) + v_5(n_0+5)`. Since `n_0+5` is a multiple of 5, `v_5(n_0+5) >= 1`. Thus, `Z(n_0+5) > m`.\n\nThis confirms that if `m` is an achievable number of zeroes, there will always be exactly 5 values of `n`: `n_0, n_0+1, n_0+2, n_0+3, n_0+4`.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Define `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function:** This function implements Legendre's formula to calculate `Z(n)`.\n    ```python\n    def count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n        count = 0\n        power_of_5 = 5\n        while n >= power_of_5:\n            count += n // power_of_5\n            power_of_5 *= 5\n        return count\n    ```\n\n2.  **Binary Search for `n_0`:** Since `Z(n)` is a non-decreasing function, we can use binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `Z(n) >= m`.\n    *   The lower bound for `n` is `1`.\n    *   The upper bound for `n`: For `m = 100,000`, `n` is approximately `400,000` (since `Z(n) \\approx n/4`). A safe upper bound for `n` can be `5 * m`. For `m=100,000`, `5 * m = 500,000` is a sufficiently large upper bound.\n    *   The binary search will find `ans_n`, which is the smallest `n` such that `count_trailing_zeroes(n) >= m`.\n\n3.  **Check and Output Results:**\n    *   After the binary search, calculate `current_zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(ans_n)`.\n    *   If `current_zeroes == m`: This means `m` is achievable. Print `5`, then print `ans_n, ans_n+1, ans_n+2, ans_n+3, ans_n+4`.\n    *   If `current_zeroes > m`: This means `m` was skipped (e.g., `Z(ans_n-1) < m < Z(ans_n)`). Print `0`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (m=1)**\n\n1.  `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` is defined.\n2.  Binary Search:\n    *   `low = 1`, `high = 5 * 1 = 5`. `ans_n = -1`.\n    *   `mid = (1+5)//2 = 3`. `Z(3) = 0`. `0 < 1`. `low = 4`.\n    *   `low = 4`, `high = 5`. `mid = (4+5)//2 = 4`. `Z(4) = 0`. `0 < 1`. `low = 5`.\n    *   `low = 5`, `high = 5`. `mid = (5+5)//2 = 5`. `Z(5) = 1`. `1 >= 1`. `ans_n = 5`. `high = 4`.\n    *   `low = 5`, `high = 4`. Loop terminates.\n3.  `ans_n = 5`. `current_zeroes = count_trailing_zeroes(5) = 1`.\n4.  `current_zeroes == m` (1 == 1).\n5.  Print `5`.\n6.  Print `5 6 7 8 9`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n**Complexity**\n\n*   The `count_trailing_zeroes(n)` function runs in `O(log_5 n)` time. For `n` up to `5 * 10^5`, this is about 8-9 iterations.\n*   The binary search runs in `O(log N)` iterations, where `N` is the search space (`5 * m`). For `m = 10^5`, `N = 5 * 10^5`, so `log_2(5 * 10^5)` is about 19 iterations.\n*   Total time complexity: `O(log M * log_5 (5M))`, which is very efficient for the given constraints.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of trailing zeroes in n!.\n    This is equivalent to counting the factors of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.\n    Uses Legendre's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    power_of_5 = 5\n    while n >= power_of_5:\n        count += n // power_of_5\n        # Prevent potential overflow for power_of_5 in languages with fixed-size integers.\n        # Python handles large integers automatically, so this check is not strictly necessary\n        # but good practice for general competitive programming.\n        # The loop condition 'n >= power_of_5' already handles termination.\n        if power_of_5 > n / 5: # Check if next power_of_5 would exceed n\n             break\n        power_of_5 *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Binary search for the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m\n    low = 1\n    # A safe upper bound for n.
