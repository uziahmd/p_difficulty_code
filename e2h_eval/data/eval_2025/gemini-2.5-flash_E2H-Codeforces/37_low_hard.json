Construct an array b by permuting a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 0 < k < n) the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different, i. e. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 22) — the size of the array.The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the elements of the array.\n\n## Output\nIf there is no such array b, print -1.Otherwise in the only line print n space-separated integers b1, b2, ..., bn. Note that b must be a permutation of a.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1 2', '4\\n1000 100 10 1']\n\n### Output\n['2 1', '100 1 1000 10']\n\n## Note\nAn array x is a permutation of y, if we can shuffle elements of y such that it will coincide with x.Note that the empty subset and the subset containing all indices are not counted.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Gluttony\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Gluttony\" problem. The core of it is building a permutation `b` from an input array `a` such that the sums of elements in any non-empty proper subset of `a` and the corresponding subset of `b` are *different*.  I need to make sure that the sums of all proper subsets are distinct between `a` and `b`, except for the full set which is excluded.\n\nThe constraint on *n* being small (up to 22) is giving me a hint that a brute-force approach, while possible, might not be the most elegant or efficient solution. I'm focusing on the condition where `sum(a[xi] for xi in S) != sum(b[xi] for xi in S)`.\n\nThe crucial bit I need to keep in mind is the exclusion of the empty set and the full set of indices.  The full set means that the total sum of `a` and `b` doesn't need to be considered. Since `b` is a permutation of `a`, their total sums will always be the same.\n\nNow I'm brainstorming different ways to construct `b`. My first thought is: can I try simply re-arranging elements in a way that increases the sums of subsets?\n\nI'm starting to zero in on a potential solution here. If I sort `a`, then cyclically shift its elements to generate `b`, will that work? Let's say I sort `a` such that `a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1}` and define `b_i = a_{(i+1) % n}`. Then `b` would be `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}, a_0]`.\n\nIt seems like this would work as if any sums of subsets where equal, they will contain different combination of values. This sounds promising! I need to rigorously analyze the subset sums and show that `a_S != b_S` for any appropriate `S`. This approach is known to work for this problem. Let's start the implementation now.\n",
