Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving the \"Feed the Golorp\" Problem: My Initial Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Feed the Golorp\" problem, and my first instinct is to break it down. It's a competitive programming problem, so the goal is efficient code. The core of it seems to be finding the smallest sequence of digits that satisfies some conditions. The input, the \"Golorp Name,\" is a clever string representation of these conditions.\n\nMy immediate focus is understanding the structure of this Golorp Name. It's got these two distinct parts, the expression and the constraints. The expression, enclosed in `?( )`, defines how the variables are used, while the constraints after `):-` specify the inequalities and equalities that must hold true.\n\nThe key to the whole thing is those `_` characters. They're the variables, and their positions within the string matter a lot. The format suggests a first come, first served rule with variables. So, the first `_` is v0, the second is v1, and so on. It's all about mapping those positions to variable indices. Also, the problem asks for the lexicographically smallest solution. That means I need to search for 0, then 1, and so on in each variable's potential value.\n\nNow, I need to parse the expressions and constraints. Standard arithmetic operators are there: +, -, \\*, /, along with comparison operators: >, <, <=, >=, ==, !=. It will be fun to interpret a string of text into a mathematical equation. My plan is to start by counting the total number of `_` characters to determine the number of variables. As I parse each part, I need to keep track of this correspondence, correctly. It looks like it could be a depth-first search to find each variable's value, starting from zero.\n\nThis problem looks like a fun and interesting exercise in parsing, variable assignment, and constraint satisfaction. I need to write a Python script for it. Let's start coding!\n",

It's mapping by *order of appearance*.\n    #    Let's refine Hypothesis 2:\n    #    Each `_` sequence in the main expression is assigned a unique variable index from `0` to `K-1` based on its order of appearance.\n    #    `_` (first sequence) -> `v[0]`\n    #    `_` (second sequence) -> `v[1]`\n    #    `___` (third sequence) -> `v[2]`\n    #    `__` (fourth sequence) -> `v[3]`\n    #    So, `K=4`.\n    #    Now, for the constraints: `___>__`\n    #    The first `_` sequence in the constraints is `___`. Which variable is this?\n    #    The second `_` sequence in the constraints is `__`. Which variable is this?\n    #    If `v[i]` corresponds to the `i`-th `_` sequence in the main expression, then how do we map `_` sequences in constraints?\n    #    The problem says \"Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive.\"\n    #    \"Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws.\"\n    #    This implies `v[0], v[1], ..., v[K-1]` are the values we are looking for.\n    #    The `_` sequences in the constraints must refer to these `K` variables.\n    #    The most common way to do this is by *length*.\n    #    `_` refers to `v[0]`. `__` refers to `v[1]`. `___` refers to `v[2]`. `____` refers to `v[3]`.\n    #    And so on. If there are `K` variables, then `_` to `K` underscores map to `v[0]` to `v[K-1]`.\n    #    If a sequence of underscores has length `L`, it refers to `v[L-1]`.\n    #    Let's test this on Example 1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    #    Main expression: `_-_/___*__`\n    #    Max length of `_` sequence in *entire* string: `___` (length 3).\n    #    This means we need variables for lengths 1, 2, 3. So `K=3`.\n    #    `v[0]` for `_`, `v[1]` for `__`, `v[2]` for `___`.\n    #    Main expression becomes: `v[0] - v[0] / v[2] * v[1]`\n    #    Constraints: `___ > __` becomes `v[2] > v[1]`\n    #    We need to find `v[0], v[1], v[2]` such that:\n    #    1. `v[0] - v[0] / v[2] * v[1] == 0`\n    #    2. `v[2] > v[1]`\n    #    And `v[i]` are 0-9.\n    #    The problem says \"lexicographically smallest sequence\". The output `0010` is 4 digits, not 3.\n    #    This interpretation is also wrong.\n\n    # This is a very frustrating problem due to the ambiguity of `_`.\n    # Let's reconsider \"very easy question\". This implies a direct parsing and brute force.\n    # The only way N (number of variables) is small enough for brute force (10^N) is if N is <= ~7-9.\n    # But we saw N can be 70 (total `_`s) or 7 (number of `_` sequences in main expr).\n    # If N is small (e.g., 7), then 10^7 is feasible.\n    # Example 3 has `K=7` variables by my current hypothesis (number of `_` sequences in main expr).\n    # `0250341` is the output. This is 7 digits. `10^7` iterations is feasible.\n\n    # Let's try the Hypothesis that `K` is the number of `_` sequences in the main expression.\n    # And these `K` variables are `v[0], v[1], ..., v[K-1]`.\n    # And all `_` sequences in the *entire* string map to these `K` variables *cyclically*.\n    # That is, the 1st `_` sequence maps to `v[0]`, 2nd to `v[1]`, ..., K-th to `v[K-1]`, (K+1)-th to `v[0]`, etc.\n    # This matches the `0010` output for Ex1.\n    # Ex1: `?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.`\n    # Main expression: `_-_/___*__`\n    # `_` (1st sequence) -> `v[0]`\n    # `_` (2nd sequence) -> `v[1]`\n    # `___` (3rd sequence) -> `v[2]`\n    # `__` (4th sequence) -> `v[3]`\n    # So `K=4`.\n    # Now, let's parse the *entire* string, replacing `_` sequences with `v[i]` based on this cyclic rule.\n    # The first `_` sequence is `_` (len 1).
