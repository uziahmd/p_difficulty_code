Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Approach for the \"Road to 1600\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to solve this competitive programming problem. Let me break down my thought process. The core of the problem is about designing an `N x N` board filled with distinct numbers from `1` to `N*N`.  A piece moves across the board following these rules: it always moves to the unvisited cell with the *lowest* number it can reach in one move. If it can't move to an unvisited cell, it teleports to the lowest-numbered unvisited cell and pays a \"vun.\" The ultimate goal is to generate a board where the rook pays fewer vuns than the queen. And there is a special case of N=1, which produces -1.\n\nMy initial understanding is: the rook can move horizontally and vertically, while the queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Given the movement rules, the \"vuns\" are paid when a piece is trapped and must teleport. So, intuitively, to minimize rook vuns and maximize queen vuns, I need to design a board where the rook gets \"stuck\" less often than the queen. However, this is starting to feel complex.\n\nMy initial instinct is that the queen should pay strictly *more* vuns. But thinking deeper, if the rook gets stuck, the queen *must* also be stuck because the queen has all the rook's moves, *plus* diagonals. This seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the rule: \"Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number.\" I need to consider a scenario: If the rook *cannot* move to an unvisited cell, but the queen *can*, this would solve the problem!\n\nI need to focus on designing the board such that, at certain points, the queen has more immediate options to an unvisited cell than the rook. This means designing the board's structure strategically to create these \"traps\" for the rook, where the queen can navigate around them. I will need to experiment with board configurations to see if I can force this to happen frequently enough. I'll probably need to consider some basic strategies:\n* Trying small values of N (like 3 or 4).\n* The structure of the movement rules.\n*  Whether this problem is even solvable for large N.\n\nIt feels like this is the key to cracking this problem. I need to make the queen's *larger* set of moves be a disadvantage at certain steps, by carefully placing numbers on the board.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to construct an `N x N` board with numbers from `1` to `N*N` such that a rook pays strictly fewer vuns than a queen. If no such board exists, we should print `-1`.\n\nLet's analyze when a piece pays a vun:\nA vun is paid if, from the current cell, there are no unvisited cells reachable in one move, but there are still unvisited cells remaining on the board. The piece then \"teleports\" to the smallest unvisited number.\n\nThe queen's movement is a superset of the rook's movement (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal vs. horizontal and vertical). This means:\n1.  If a rook can reach a cell, a queen can also reach it.\n2.  If a queen cannot reach any unvisited cell, a rook also cannot (as it has fewer options). In this case, both would pay a vun.\n3.  If a rook cannot reach any unvisited cell, but a queen *can* (due to its diagonal moves), then the rook pays a vun, while the queen makes a move.\n\nOur goal is `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`. Based on point 3, this can only happen if there are situations where the rook gets stuck and pays a vun, but the queen does not. This implies we want to make the rook get stuck often while the queen still has options.\n\nConsider the numbers on the board. The pieces always move to the smallest available number. To make a piece get stuck, we need to arrange numbers such that all reachable unvisited cells have relatively large numbers, while smaller unvisited numbers are far away (not reachable in one move).\n\nLet's try a simple construction strategy:\nPlace numbers `1, 2, ..., K` in one \"half\" of the board and `K+1, ..., N*N` in the other \"half\". This creates a natural separation.\nFor an `N x N` board, we can divide it into two `N x (N/2)` rectangles (if N is even) or `N x (N/2)` and `N x (N/2 + 1)` rectangles (if N is odd).\n\nLet's place the smaller numbers (`1` to `ceil(N*N/2)`) in the first `N/2` columns and the larger numbers (`ceil(N*N/2) + 1` to `N*N`) in the remaining `N/2` columns.\nSpecifically, we can fill the cells `(i, j)` where `j < N/2` with small numbers and cells `(i, j)` where `j >= N/2` with large numbers.\n\nA more effective strategy for separating rook and queen movement involves splitting the board into two checkerboard-like patterns or diagonal patterns, but a simple half-split is often sufficient.\n\nLet's try filling the board as follows:\n*   Fill the cells `(r, c)` where `(r + c)` is even (or `(r + c) % 2 == 0`) with the smaller numbers `1, 2, ..., ceil(N*N/2)`.\n*   Fill the cells `(r, c)` where `(r + c)` is odd (or `(r + c) % 2 == 1`) with the larger numbers `ceil(N*N/2) + 1, ..., N*N`.\n\nThe numbers within each group can be filled in any order, for example, row by row, column by column. Let's try filling them in increasing order.\n\nExample: `N=4`\n`N*N = 16`. `ceil(16/2) = 8`.\nSmall numbers: `1` to `8`. Large numbers: `9` to `16`.\n\nBoard coordinates `(row, col)` from `(0,0)` to `(N-1, N-1)`:\n`+` indicates `(r+c)` is even, `-` indicates `(r+c)` is odd.\n`+-+-`\n`-+-+`\n`+-+-`\n`-+-+`\n\nFill `+` cells with `1, ..., 8`:\n`1 . 2 .`\n`. 3 . 4`\n`5 . 6 .`\n`. 7 . 8`\n\nFill `-` cells with `9, ..., 16`:\n`1  9  2 10`\n`11 3 12 4`\n`5 13 6 14`\n`15 7 16 8`\n\nLet's trace this board for `N=4`:\nStart at `1` (cell `(0,0)`).\n\n**Rook's Path:**\nCurrent: `(0,0)` (value 1).

This is exactly what my initial strategy tried. The example output is not following this pattern.\n\nLet's re-examine the example's `N=4` output:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet's find the cells for `1` to `16`:\n`1: (2,1)`\n`2: (3,3)`\n`3: (0,1)`\n`4: (0,0)`\n`5: (1,1)`\n`6: (0,2)`\n`7: (1,0)`\n`8: (3,1)`\n`9: (1,2)`\n`10: (2,3)`\n`11: (2,2)`\n`12: (0,3)`\n`13: (3,0)`\n`14: (2,0)`\n`15: (1,3)`\n`16: (3,2)`\n\nThe key observation is that the rook cannot move diagonally, while the queen can. If we place the small numbers such that they are connected by diagonal moves but not by orthogonal moves, the queen might be able to follow the small numbers, while the rook gets stuck.\n\nConsider the cells `(r, c)` where `r` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). These cells are connected by queen's diagonal moves.\nConsider the cells `(r, c)` where `r` and `c` have different parity (one even, one odd). These cells are also connected by queen's diagonal moves.\nA rook cannot move between these two sets of cells using only diagonal moves.\n\nLet's try to put small numbers in cells where `r+c` is even, and large numbers in cells where `r+c` is odd.\nThis is the checkerboard pattern.\nCells `(r,c)` with `r+c` even: `(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)`\nCells `(r,c)` with `r+c` odd: `(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)`\n\nLet's fill the first set of cells with numbers `1, ..., N*N/2` and the second set with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nThe example's `N=4` output:\n`1` is at `(2,1)` (odd sum `2+1=3`).\n`2` is at `(3,3)` (even sum `3+3=6`).\n`3` is at `(0,1)` (odd sum `0+1=1`).\n`4` is at `(0,0)` (even sum `0+0=0`).\nThis strategy is mixing up the parity.\n\nThe example solution for `N=4` has `1` at `(2,1)`.\nThe path of the rook: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`. `vuns_rook = 1`.\nThe path of the queen: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`. `vuns_queen = 2`.\nThis works.\n\nLet's analyze the example solution's construction.\nThe cells `(r,c)` where `r` is even, `c` is odd, or `r` is odd, `c` is even. These are the \"white\" cells on a checkerboard if `(0,0)` is \"black\".\nThe cells `(r,c)` where `r` is even, `c` is even, or `r` is odd, `c` is odd. These are the \"black\" cells.\n\nIn the example solution for `N=4`:\nCells `(r,c)` with `r+c` even (black cells): `(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)`\nValues: `4, 6, 5, 15, 14, 11, 8, 2`\nCells `(r,c)` with `r+c` odd (white cells): `(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)`\nValues: `3, 12, 7, 9, 1, 10, 13, 16`\n\nIt seems the example solution puts `1` on a \"white\" cell `(2,1)`.\nThe numbers `1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 16, 12, 10` are on \"white\" cells.\nThe numbers `2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14, 15` are on \"black\" cells.\n\nThe small numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8` are distributed across both \"colors\".\n`1` (white), `2` (black), `3` (white), `4` (black), `5` (black), `6` (black), `7` (white), `8` (black).\n\nThe key insight might be simpler:\nFor `N=1`, output `-1` (as 0 is not strictly less than 0).\nFor `N > 1`:\nThe rook can only move between cells `(r,c)` and `(r',c')` if `r=r'` or `c=c'`.\nThe queen can also move if `|r-r'| = |c-c'|`.\n\nConsider a simple pattern:\nFill the first `N*N/2` cells (e.g., `(r,c)` where `r` is even, `c` is even, or `r` is odd, `c` is odd) with numbers `1, 2, ..., N*N/2`.\nFill the remaining `N*N - N*N/2` cells (e.g., `(r,c)` where `r` is even, `c` is odd, or `r` is odd, `c` is even) with numbers `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\n\nLet's try this with `N=4`. `N*N/2 = 8`.\n`board[r][c]` for `r,c` from `0` to `N-1`.\n`r+c` is even: `(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)`\n`r+c` is odd: `(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)`\n\nFill `r+c` even with `1..8`:\n`board[0][0] = 1`\n`board[0][2] = 2`\n`board[1][1] = 3`\n`board[1][3] = 4`\n`board[2][0] = 5`\n`board[2][2] = 6`\n`board[3][1] = 7`\n`board[3][3] = 8`\n\nFill `r+c` odd with `9..16`:\n`board[0][1] = 9`\n`board[0][3] = 10`\n`board[1][0] = 11`\n`board[1][2] = 12`\n`board[2][1] = 13`\n`board[2][3] = 14`\n`board[3][0] = 15`\n`board[3][2] = 16`\n\nResulting board:\n`1  9  2 10`\n`11 3 12 4`\n`5 13 6 14`\n`15 7 16 8`\n\nThis is the board I manually traced above, which resulted in `vuns_rook = 1`, `vuns_queen = 0`. This is not `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`.\n\nThe problem is that `1` is on an even-sum cell `(0,0)`.\nIf `1` is on an even-sum cell, all cells reachable by a rook in one move from `1` will also be on even-sum cells (or odd-sum cells if `N` is small and `1` is near border).\nNo, that's incorrect. If `1` is at `(0,0)`, a rook can go to `(0,1)` or `(1,0)`. Both `(0,1)` and `(1,0)` are odd-sum cells. So the rook can move between even-sum and odd-sum cells.\n\nThe example solution for `N=4` has `1` at `(2,1)`, which is an odd-sum cell.\nLet's try to put `1` on an odd-sum cell, and then fill the odd-sum cells with `1, ..., N*N/2` and even-sum cells with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nThis is just swapping the two sets of numbers in my previous attempt.\nLet `odd_sum_cells` be filled with `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nLet `even_sum_cells` be filled with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\n\nFor `N=4`:\n`board[0][1] = 1`\n`board[0][3] = 2`\n`board[1][0] = 3`\n`board[1][2] = 4`\n`board[2][1] = 5`\n`board[2][3] = 6`\n`board[3][0] = 7`\n`board[3][2] = 8`\n\n`board[0][0] = 9`\n`board[0][2] = 10`\n`board[1][1] = 11`\n`board[1][3] = 12`\n`board[2][0] = 13`\n`board[2][2] = 14`\n`board[3][1] = 15`\n`board[3][3] = 16`\n\nResulting board:\n`9  1 10 2`\n`3 11 4 12`\n`13 5 14 6`\n`7 15 8 16`\n\nLet's trace this board for `N=4`.

My simple checkerboard pattern always results in `vuns_rook >= vuns_queen`. This is because the queen can always reach more cells. If the rook is stuck, the queen might not be. If the queen is stuck, the rook must also be stuck. So, `vuns_rook` can be greater than `vuns_queen` only if the queen gets stuck when the rook is not, which is impossible. Or if the queen gets stuck and pays a vun, but then the rook (which would also be stuck) has already paid a vun for that same 'stuck' situation.\n\nThe only way `vuns_rook < vuns_queen` can happen is if the sequence of visited cells somehow causes the queen to visit a set of cells that makes *it* stuck, while the rook's path leads to a different configuration where it is not stuck. This is not possible because the choice is always the minimal unvisited number. The sequence of cells visited up to `k` will be `1, 2, ..., k`. Both pieces visit the same set of numbers, just in a different order.\n\nLet `S_k = {1, ..., k}` be the set of numbers visited.\nLet `C_p` be the current cell of piece `p`.\nLet `U = {k+1, ..., N*N}` be the set of unvisited numbers.\nLet `R_reachable(C_rook)` be unvisited cells reachable by rook from `C_rook`.\nLet `Q_reachable(C_queen)` be unvisited cells reachable by queen from `C_queen`.\n\nIf `min(val for cell, val in R_reachable(C_rook)) > min(val for cell, val in Q_reachable(C_queen))`, then the queen will pick a smaller number. This can lead to different paths. This is the key.\n\nThe example output for `N=4` has `1` at `(2,1)`.\nRook path: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`\nQueen path: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`\n\nLet's look at the point where their paths diverge:\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 4`. Current `(0,0)`. Visited ` {1,3,4} `.\n   Reachable from `(0,0)`: `(0,1)` (3, visited), `(0,2)` (6), `(0,3)` (12), `(1,0)` (7), `(2,0)` (14), `(3,0)` (13).\n   Smallest unvisited: `6`. Rook moves `4 -> 6`.\n\nQueen: `1 -> 3 -> 4`. Current `(0,0)`. Visited ` {1,3,4} `.\n   Reachable from `(0,0)`: `(0,1)` (3, visited), `(0,2)` (6), `(0,3)` (12), `(1,0)` (7), `(2,0)` (14), `(3,0)` (13), `(1,1)` (5), `(2,2)` (11), `(3,3)` (2).\n   Smallest unvisited: `2`. Queen moves `4 -> 2`.\n\nThis is the divergence! The queen, having diagonal moves, can reach `2` at `(3,3)`, which is smaller than `6` (the smallest reachable for rook).\nThis is exactly what we need. The queen takes a smaller number, which potentially leads it to a \"bad\" region earlier.\n\nThe strategy:\n1.  Place `1` somewhere.\n2.  Place `2` such that it's reachable by queen but not by rook from `1`.\n3.  Place `3` such that it's reachable by both from `1`.\n4.  This way, the queen will go `1 -> 2`, while the rook goes `1 -> 3`. Their paths diverge.\n\nConsider `N=1`. Output `-1`.\nFor `N > 1`:\nWe need to construct a board. Let's try to generalize the example's pattern.\nThe example output for `N=4` seems to put numbers `1` to `N*N/2` (8 for N=4) in the top-left quadrant (`N/2 x N/2` cells) and the bottom-right quadrant (`N/2 x N/2` cells). And `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` in the other two quadrants. No, this isn't quite right.\n\nLet's simplify.\nWe need `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`.\nThis means the queen must get stuck at least one more time than the rook.\nThe queen gets stuck if all reachable cells are visited.\nThe rook gets stuck if all reachable cells are visited.\n\nIf `N` is odd, `N*N` is odd. `N*N/2` is not an integer. Let `K = (N*N + 1) / 2`.\nIf `N` is even, `N*N` is even. `K = N*N / 2`.\n\nLet's consider cells `(r,c)` where `r < N/2`. These are the \"top\" rows.\nLet's consider cells `(r,c)` where `r >= N/2`. These are the \"bottom\" rows.\n\nLet's try to fill the cells in the top-left `N/2 x N/2` quadrant and bottom-right `N/2 x N/2` quadrant with `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nAnd the top-right `N/2 x N/2` and bottom-left `N/2 x N/2` quadrants with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nThis is essentially splitting the board into two sets of `N*N/2` cells.\nSet A: `(r,c)` where `(r < N/2 \\land c < N/2)` or `(r >= N/2 \\land c >= N/2)`.\nSet B: `(r < N/2 \\land c >= N/2)` or `(r >= N/2 \\land c < N/2)`.\n\nLet `count_small = 0`, `count_large = N*N/2`.\nCreate an `N x N` board.\nIterate `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`.\nIf `(r < N/2 and c < N/2)` or `(r >= N/2 and c >= N/2)`:\n  `board[r][c] = count_small + 1`\n  `count_small += 1`\nElse:\n  `board[r][c] = count_large + 1`\n  `count_large += 1`\n\nLet's try this for `N=4`. `N/2 = 2`. `N*N/2 = 8`.\nSmall numbers: `1..8`. Large numbers: `9..16`.\n`r < 2, c < 2`: `(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)` (top-left)\n`r >= 2, c >= 2`: `(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)` (bottom-right)\nFill these 8 cells with `1..8`.\n\n`r < 2, c >= 2`: `(0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3)` (top-right)\n`r >= 2, c < 2`: `(2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1)` (bottom-left)\nFill these 8 cells with `9..16`.\n\nBoard:\n`1  2  9 10`\n`3  4 11 12`\n`13 14 5  6`\n`15 16 7  8`\n\nLet's trace this for `N=4`.

(0 vuns for both, not strictly less).\n\nFor `N > 1`:\nLet's try to make the small numbers `1, ..., N*N/2` fill a \"diagonal\" pattern.\nThe example output for `N=4` has a specific structure.\nSmall numbers (1 to 8): `4,3,6,7,5,1,8,2`\nLarge numbers (9 to 16): `12,15,9,14,11,10,13,16`\nThe small numbers are somewhat clustered in the top-left and bottom-right.\n`1` is at `(2,1)`. `2` is at `(3,3)`. `3` is at `(0,1)`. `4` is at `(0,0)`.\n\nWhat if we fill the board in a specific order?\nTry filling the cells `(r,c)` where `r` is even with small numbers, and `r` is odd with large numbers.\nNo, that's too simple.\n\nThe example output for `N=4` is:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet's look at the cells with numbers `1` to `N*N/2` (which is 8 for `N=4`).\n`1: (2,1)`\n`2: (3,3)`\n`3: (0,1)`\n`4: (0,0)`\n`5: (1,1)`\n`6: (0,2)`\n`7: (1,0)`\n`8: (3,1)`\n\nThese cells form a pattern where they are mostly on a \"diagonal\" band, or checkerboard-like.\nThe cells where `r+c` is even (black): `(0,0) (0,2) (1,1) (1,3) (2,0) (2,2) (3,1) (3,3)`\nNumbers in these cells: `4, 6, 5, 15, 14, 11, 8, 2`\nThe cells where `r+c` is odd (white): `(0,1) (0,3) (1,0) (1,2) (2,1) (2,3) (3,0) (3,2)`\nNumbers in these cells: `3, 12, 7, 9, 1, 10, 13, 16`\n\nThe example solution puts `1` on a white cell `(2,1)`.\nThe numbers `1, 3, 7` are on white cells. `2, 4, 5, 6, 8` are on black cells.\nIt seems that the small numbers are distributed such that the queen can jump to a smaller number, but this smaller number is on a cell that is not orthogonally reachable from the current one.\n\nLet's try this pattern:\nFill the first `N*N/2` cells with `1, ..., N*N/2` by alternating between the two \"colors\" of a checkerboard.\nAnd the remaining `N*N/2` cells with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` by alternating between the two \"colors\".\n\nSpecifically, let's fill `N*N/2` \"black\" cells (where `r+c` is even) with `1, 3, 5, ...`\nAnd `N*N/2` \"white\" cells (where `r+c` is odd) with `2, 4, 6, ...`\nThis way, `1` is on a black cell. `2` is on a white cell. `3` is on a black cell.\nThe queen can move from a black cell to a white cell diagonally. The rook cannot.\n\nLet `board` be an `N x N` matrix.\n`even_cells = []`\n`odd_cells = []`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r+c) % 2 == 0`:\n      `even_cells.append((r,c))`\n    Else:\n      `odd_cells.append((r,c))`\n\n`num_even = len(even_cells)`\n`num_odd = len(odd_cells)`\n\nFill `board`:\n`small_num = 1`\n`large_num = N*N`\n\nIf `num_even >= num_odd`: (This is true for `N*N` total cells, `N` even or odd. `(N*N + (N%2))` even cells, `(N*N - (N%2))` odd cells)\n  Iterate `(r,c)` in `even_cells`:\n    `board[r][c] = small_num`\n    `small_num += 2`\n  Iterate `(r,c)` in `odd_cells`:\n    `board[r][c] = large_num`\n    `large_num -= 2`\n  `small_num = 2`\n  Iterate `(r,c)` in `odd_cells`:\n    If `board[r][c]` is not yet filled (this happens if `num_even > num_odd`):\n      `board[r][c] = small_num`\n      `small_num += 2`\n  `large_num = N*N - 1`\n  Iterate `(r,c)` in `even_cells`:\n    If `board[r][c]` is not yet filled:\n      `board[r][c] = large_num`\n      `large_num -= 2`\nThis is too complicated. Let's simplify.\n\nThere are `ceil(N*N/2)` cells of one color and `floor(N*N/2)` cells of the other color.\nLet's call the color of `(0,0)` \"black\" (sum `r+c` is even).\nLet `k = N*N/2`.\nFill the `k` \"black\" cells with `1, ..., k`.\nFill the `N*N - k` \"white\" cells with `k+1, ..., N*N`.\n\nThis is the checkerboard pattern I tried earlier, which resulted in `vuns_rook = 1`, `vuns_queen = 0` for `N=4`. It means this pattern `vuns_rook >= vuns_queen` and not `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`.\n\nThe example solution is the only working one for `N=4`.\nWhat if `N=2`? Output:\n`1 4`\n`3 2`\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4`. 0 vuns.\nQueen: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`. 0 vuns.\nCondition `0 < 0` is false. So `N=2` might also be `-1`.\nThe problem states `N=1` is `-1`. The example output for `N=4` is a specific solution. What about `N=2,3`?\nIf `N=2`, `N*N=4`.\n`board[0][0]` `board[0][1]`\n`board[1][0]` `board[1][1]`\n`1` must be placed somewhere. Let `1` be at `(0,0)`.\nRook from `(0,0)` can reach `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.\nQueen from `(0,0)` can reach `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, and `(1,1)`.\nThe queen always has more or equal options.\nIf `N=2`, the number of cells is small, paths are short.\nIt seems hard to make `vuns_rook < vuns_queen` for small `N`.\n\nMaybe the solution only exists for `N >= 4`.\nThe example states `N=1` does not have solution.\nThe problem statement says `1 <= N <= 500`.\n\nLet's re-examine the example `N=4` output:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet's divide the board into two halves: top `N/2` rows and bottom `N/2` rows.\nFor `N=4`, top two rows: `(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)` and `(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)`.\nBottom two rows: `(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)` and `(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)`.\n\nValues in top half: `4,3,6,12,7,5,9,15`.

This satisfies `vuns_rook > vuns_queen`.\nThis is `2 > 1`, so `vuns_rook` is NOT strictly less than `vuns_queen`. It's strictly greater.\nWe need `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`.\n\nThis implies my reasoning that `vuns_rook` is always `>= vuns_queen` is correct, and the problem asks for the opposite.\nThis means the only way is if the *example* output is the one to follow, and it's a special case, or my detailed tracing of the example solution was wrong.\n\nLet's re-check the example output trace for `N=4`.\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`. `vuns_rook = 1`.\nQueen: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`. `vuns_queen = 2`.\nThis is `1 < 2`, which means rook pays strictly less. So the example output *does* work.\nMy earlier analysis of the example was correct.\n\nThe key divergence was:\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 4`. Current `(0,0)`. Visited ` {1,3,4} `. Smallest reachable for rook is `6`.\nQueen: `1 -> 3 -> 4`. Current `(0,0)`. Visited ` {1,3,4} `. Smallest reachable for queen is `2`.\nThe queen takes `2` at `(3,3)`. The rook takes `6` at `(0,2)`.\n\nThis means the queen's path leads it to get stuck more often. How?\nThe queen jumps to `2` at `(3,3)`. This cell is `(N-1, N-1)`. It's a corner.\nFrom `(3,3)`, the queen can reach `(0,0), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)`.\nMany of these cells are already visited by the queen's path.\n`1` at `(2,1)`\n`3` at `(0,1)`\n`4` at `(0,0)`\n`2` at `(3,3)`\n`5` at `(1,1)`\n`6` at `(0,2)`\n`9` at `(1,2)`\n`7` at `(1,0)`\n`13` at `(3,0)`\n`8` at `(3,1)`\n`11` at `(2,2)`\n`10` at `(2,3)`\n`12` at `(0,3)`\n`15` at `(1,3)`\n`14` at `(2,0)`\n`16` at `(3,2)`\n\nThe example solution for `N=4` is not following a simple checkerboard or quadrant division.\nIt places `1` in the middle of the bottom half. `(2,1)`.\nIt places `2` at the bottom-right corner. `(3,3)`.\nIt places `3` at the top-middle. `(0,1)`.\nIt places `4` at the top-left corner. `(0,0)`.\n\nThis specific arrangement seems to be key.\nThe top-left `N/2 x N/2` block and bottom-right `N/2 x N/2` block can be considered \"main\" blocks.\nThe other two blocks are \"cross\" blocks.\n\nLet `k = N*N`.\nLet's try to fill `N*N/2` cells with `1, ..., N*N/2` and the remaining `N*N/2` cells with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nThe example places `1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8` in the first `N*N/2` values. `2` is also in this group.\nThe example board is actually very simple:\nIt fills the first `N*N/2` cells (in reading order) with `N*N` down to `N*N - N*N/2 + 1`.\nAnd the remaining `N*N/2` cells with `1` up to `N*N/2`.\nNo, that's not it either.\n\nWhat if we fill the board in a snake-like pattern?\nOr just fill the first `N/2` rows with small numbers and the second `N/2` rows with large numbers.\nNo, I tried this and it didn't work.\n\nThe example `N=4` solution is the only one given. What if this pattern works for all `N`?\n`N=1` is `-1`.\nFor `N >= 2`:\nLet's divide `N x N` board into 4 sub-squares of size `N/2 x N/2`. (Assume `N` is even for now).\nTop-Left (TL): `(0..N/2-1, 0..N/2-1)`\nTop-Right (TR): `(0..N/2-1, N/2..N-1)`\nBottom-Left (BL): `(N/2..N-1, 0..N/2-1)`\nBottom-Right (BR): `(N/2..N-1, N/2..N-1)`\n\nExample `N=4`:\nTL: `(0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1)` values `4,3,7,5`\nTR: `(0,2) (0,3) (1,2) (1,3)` values `6,12,9,15`\nBL: `(2,0) (2,1) (3,0) (3,1)` values `14,1,13,8`\nBR: `(2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3)` values `11,10,16,2`\n\nIt looks like the strategy is to put the smallest numbers in BL and BR, and largest in TL and TR.\nSpecifically:\n`1` is in BL. `2` is in BR. `3` is in TL. `4` is in TL.\nThis is not a simple quadrant fill.\n\nLet `board` be `N x N`.\n`count = 1`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r+c)%2 == 0`:\n      `board[r][c] = count`\n      `count += 1`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r+c)%2 != 0`:\n      `board[r][c] = count`\n      `count += 1`\n\nThis is the checkerboard pattern where all even-sum cells are filled first, then all odd-sum cells.\nThis means `1, ..., ceil(N*N/2)` are on even-sum cells and `ceil(N*N/2)+1, ..., N*N` are on odd-sum cells.\nI traced this for `N=4` and got `vuns_rook=1, vuns_queen=0`. Still not working.\n\nThe solution must be something very simple that works for all `N`.\nThe example output for `N=4` is:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet's consider `N*N` cells.\nHalf of them will be `(r,c)` where `r+c` is even.\nHalf of them will be `(r,c)` where `r+c` is odd.\n(If `N*N` is odd, one group will have one more cell).\n\nLet's fill the cells `(r,c)` where `r+c` is even with `1, 2, ..., ceil(N*N/2)`.\nAnd the cells `(r,c)` where `r+c` is odd with `ceil(N*N/2)+1, ..., N*N`.\nThis is my first checkerboard pattern. It didn't work.\n\nWhat if we fill the cells `(r,c)` where `r+c` is odd with `1, 2, ..., ceil(N*N/2)`.\nAnd the cells `(r,c)` where `r+c` is even with `ceil(N*N/2)+1, ..., N*N`.\nThis is the second checkerboard pattern I tried. It didn't work either.\n\nThe problem for `N=1` is `-1`.\nFor `N=2`, let's try to construct one.\n`1 2`\n`3 4`\nRook: `1->2->4->3`. 0 vuns.\nQueen: `1->2->3->4`. 0 vuns.\n`0 < 0` is false.\n\n`1 3`\n`2 4`\nRook: `1->2->4->3`. 0 vuns.\nQueen: `1->2->3->4`. 0 vuns.\n`0 < 0` is false.\n\nIt feels like `N=2,3` also don't have a solution.\nIf `N` is small, the board is too connected.\nThe example output for `N=4` is the *only* hint.\nIt seems to be a specific construction for `N >= 4`.\nFor `N=2,3`, it might be `-1`.\n\nLet's test `N=3`. `N*N=9`.\n`1 2 3`\n`4 5 6`\n`7 8 9`\nRook: `1->2->3->6->9->8->7->4->5`. 0 vuns.\nQueen: `1->2->3->6->9->5->4->7->8`. 0 vuns.\n\nThis problem looks like it has a specific construction that works for `N >= 4`.\nThe example solution for `N=4` is:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nThis board can be generated by filling numbers `1` to `N*N/2` into `N*N/2` cells, and `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` into the other `N*N/2` cells.\nThe pattern for the example solution is:\nFill cells `(r,c)` with `r < N/2` and `c < N/2` (top-left) with some numbers.\nFill cells `(r,c)` with `r < N/2` and `c >= N/2` (top-right) with some numbers.\nFill cells `(r,c)` with `r >= N/2` and `c < N/2` (bottom-left) with some numbers.\nFill cells `(r,c)` with `r >= N/2` and `c >= N/2` (bottom-right) with some numbers.\n\nLet's take `N=4`. `N/2 = 2`.\nCells in TL: `(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)`\nCells in TR: `(0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3)`\nCells in BL: `(2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1)`\nCells in BR: `(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)`\n\nNumbers `1` to `N*N/2` (`1..8`) are placed in BL and BR.\n`1` in BL, `2` in BR, `8` in BL.\nNumbers `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` (`9..16`) are placed in TL and TR.\n`9` in TR, `10` in BR, `11` in BR, `12` in TR.\n\nThis is the pattern:\nFill `board[r][c]` for `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`.\n`small_val = 1`\n`large_val = N*N/2 + 1`\n\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r+c)` is even:  (These are the \"black\" cells)\n      `board[r][c] = large_val`\n      `large_val += 1`\n    Else:  (These are the \"white\" cells)\n      `board[r][c] = small_val`\n      `small_val += 1`\n\nThis is the checkerboard pattern where even-sum cells get large numbers, odd-sum cells get small numbers.\nThis is exactly the pattern I traced for `N=4` which yielded `vuns_rook=1, vuns_queen=0`.\nThis is `vuns_rook > vuns_queen` which is not what we want.\n\nThe example output's `1` is at `(2,1)` (odd sum).\nThe example output's `2` is at `(3,3)` (even sum).\nThe example output's `3` is at `(0,1)` (odd sum).\nThe example output's `4` is at `(0,0)` (even sum).\n\nThis means the small numbers are mixed between odd-sum and even-sum cells.\nThis is critical. The `1` is on an odd-sum cell, `2` is on an even-sum cell.\nA rook cannot go from `(2,1)` to `(3,3)` in one move.\nA queen can go from `(2,1)` to `(3,2)` (rook move) or `(3,0)` (diag) or `(1,0)` (diag) etc.\nBut the queen can also go `(2,1) -> (3,3)` by `(2,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)` (2 moves).\nOr `(2,1) -> (1,2) -> (3,3)` (2 moves).\n\nThe example is very specific.\nIt fills the board in a specific way:\nIt fills the top-left `N/2 x N/2` block and the bottom-right `N/2 x N/2` block with numbers `N*N/2+1` to `N*N`.\nIt fills the top-right `N/2 x N/2` block and the bottom-left `N/2 x N/2` block with numbers `1` to `N*N/2`.\nThis is the pattern I traced earlier, which resulted in `vuns_rook=1, vuns_queen=0`.\n\nThe only way the example output works is if my manual trace of it was correct.\nLet's look at the actual example trace values:\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`.\nQueen: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`.\n\nThe key divergence point:\n`1 -> 3 -> 4`. Current `(0,0)`. Visited `{1,3,4}`.\nRook's options from `(0,0)`: `(0,2)` (6), `(1,0)` (7), `(2,0)` (14), `(3,0)` (13). Min is `6`. Rook moves to `6`.\nQueen's options from `(0,0)`: `(0,2)` (6), `(1,0)` (7), `(2,0)` (14), `(3,0)` (13), `(1,1)` (5), `(2,2)` (11), `(3,3)` (2). Min is `2`. Queen moves to `2`.\n\nThis is the crucial step. The queen takes `2` at `(3,3)`. The rook takes `6` at `(0,2)`.\nThis makes the queen's path visit a cell `2` that is \"far away\" and isolated from other small numbers.\nWhen the queen gets to `(3,3)` (value `2`), its future moves are constrained.\nFrom `(3,3)` (value `2`), queen can reach `(0,0)` (4, visited), `(0,3)` (12), `(1,1)` (5), `(1,2)` (9), `(2,1)` (1, visited), `(2,2)` (11), `(3,0)` (13), `(3,1)` (8), `(3,2)` (16).\nSmallest unvisited: `5` at `(1,1)`.\nSo queen's path continues `... -> 4 -> 2 -> 5`.\n\nThe pattern for the example output is:\nFill the top `N/2` rows with numbers `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` (decreasingly).\nFill the bottom `N/2` rows with numbers `1` to `N*N/2` (increasingly).\nNo, this is not the example.\nThe example output for `N=4` has `1` at `(2,1)` and `2` at `(3,3)`.\nIt has `3` at `(0,1)` and `4` at `(0,0)`.\n\nLet's try this:\nFill `N/2` rows with `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nFill the other `N/2` rows with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nThis is the simple top/bottom half split.\n`N=4`:\n`1 2 3 4`\n`5 6 7 8`\n`9 10 11 12`\n`13 14 15 16`\nRook: `1->2->3->4->8->7->6->5->9->10->11->12->16->15->14->13`. 0 vuns.\nQueen: `1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11->12->13->14->15->16`. 0 vuns.\nThis is `0 < 0`, false.\n\nThe problem implies there is a solution for `N >= 4`.\nThe sample solution for `N=4` is the key.\nIt seems to fill the board with `N*N/2` numbers in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants (using a specific order), and the other `N*N/2` numbers in the top-right and bottom-left quadrants (using another specific order).\n\nLet `k = N*N/2`.\nLet `board` be `N x N`.\n`current_small = 1`\n`current_large = k + 1`\n\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r < N/2 and c < N/2)` or `(r >= N/2 and c >= N/2)`: (These are the \"main diagonal\" blocks)\n      `board[r][c] = current_large`\n      `current_large += 1`\n    Else: (These are the \"anti-diagonal\" blocks)\n      `board[r][c] = current_small`\n      `current_small += 1`\n\nThis would be:\n`9 10 1 2`\n`11 12 3 4`\n`5 6 13 14`\n`7 8 15 16`\n\nLet's trace this for `N=4`.

Not strictly less.\n\nThe only remaining option is that the problem expects us to literally output the example solution for `N=4`, and for other `N` values, there might not be a solution or a similar pattern is not obvious.\nHowever, competitive programming problems usually have a general solution.\nWhat if the solution is simply filling the first `N*N/2` cells of the board with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` and the remaining `N*N/2` cells with `1, ..., N*N/2`?\nThis is filling the board in reading order.\n`N=4`:\n`9 10 11 12`\n`13 14 15 16`\n`1 2 3 4`\n`5 6 7 8`\n\nRook: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> (vun) -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> (vun) -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16`. `vuns_rook = 2`.\nQueen: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> (vun) -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> (vun) -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16`. `vuns_queen = 2`.\nStill `vuns_rook = vuns_queen`.\n\nThe only case where `vuns_rook < vuns_queen` is if the queen gets stuck, but the rook does not. This is impossible.\nThe other case is if the queen gets stuck `X` times, and the rook gets stuck `Y` times, where `Y < X`.\nThis means when the rook gets stuck, the queen *must* also get stuck.\nBut when the queen gets stuck, the rook *must* also get stuck.\nSo `vuns_rook == vuns_queen` always.\n\nThis implies that the problem statement is misinterpreted, or there's a subtle trick.\n\"Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number.\"\n\"If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of 1 vun.\"\n\nLet's re-read the example trace carefully.\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`.\nQueen: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`.\n\nThe rook pays 1 vun when it's at `15` (cell `(1,3)`). All reachable cells from `(1,3)` (rook moves) are visited. Smallest unvisited is `14` at `(2,0)`.\nThe queen pays 1 vun when it's at `15` (cell `(1,3)`). All reachable cells from `(1,3)` (queen moves) are visited. Smallest unvisited is `14` at `(2,0)`.\nSo, at this point, both pay 1 vun. `vuns_rook = 1`, `vuns_queen = 1`.\nThen they both teleport to `14` at `(2,0)`.\nRook path continues `... -> 15 -> (vun) -> 14`.\nQueen path continues `... -> 15 -> (vun) -> 14`.\n\nNow, both are at `14` at `(2,0)`.\nRook's turn.

    "ground_truth": "N/A",
    "extracted_answer": "The problem asks us to construct an `N x N` board with numbers from `1` to `N*N` such that a rook pays strictly fewer vuns than a queen. If no such board exists, we should print `-1`.\n\nLet's analyze when a piece pays a vun:\nA vun is paid if, from the current cell, there are no unvisited cells reachable in one move, but there are still unvisited cells remaining on the board. The piece then \"teleports\" to the smallest unvisited number.\n\nThe queen's movement is a superset of the rook's movement (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal vs. horizontal and vertical). This means:\n1.  If a rook can reach a cell, a queen can also reach it.\n2.  If a queen cannot reach any unvisited cell, a rook also cannot (as it has fewer options). In this case, both would pay a vun.\n3.  If a rook cannot reach any unvisited cell, but a queen *can* (due to its diagonal moves), then the rook pays a vun, while the queen makes a move.\n\nOur goal is `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`. Based on point 3, this can only happen if there are situations where the rook gets stuck and pays a vun, but the queen does not. This implies we want to make the rook get stuck often while the queen still has options.\n\nConsider the numbers on the board. The pieces always move to the smallest available number. To make a piece get stuck, we need to arrange numbers such that all reachable unvisited cells have relatively large numbers, while smaller unvisited numbers are far away (not reachable in one move).\n\nLet's try a simple construction strategy:\nPlace numbers `1, 2, ..., K` in one \"half\" of the board and `K+1, ..., N*N` in the other \"half\". This creates a natural separation.\nFor an `N x N` board, we can divide it into two `N x (N/2)` rectangles (if N is even) or `N x (N/2)` and `N x (N/2 + 1)` rectangles (if N is odd).\n\nLet's place the smaller numbers (`1` to `ceil(N*N/2)`) in the first `N/2` columns and the larger numbers (`ceil(N*N/2) + 1` to `N*N`) in the remaining `N/2` columns.\nSpecifically, we can fill the cells `(i, j)` where `j < N/2` with small numbers and cells `(i, j)` where `j >= N/2` with large numbers.\n\nA more effective strategy for separating rook and queen movement involves splitting the board into two checkerboard-like patterns or diagonal patterns, but a simple half-split is often sufficient.\n\nLet's try filling the board as follows:\n*   Fill the cells `(r, c)` where `(r + c)` is even (or `(r + c) % 2 == 0`) with the smaller numbers `1, 2, ..., ceil(N*N/2)`.\n*   Fill the cells `(r, c)` where `(r + c)` is odd (or `(r + c) % 2 == 1`) with the larger numbers `ceil(N*N/2) + 1, ..., N*N`.\n\nThe numbers within each group can be filled in any order, for example, row by row, column by column. Let's try filling them in increasing order.\n\nExample: `N=4`\n`N*N = 16`. `ceil(16/2) = 8`.\nSmall numbers: `1` to `8`. Large numbers: `9` to `16`.\n\nBoard coordinates `(row, col)` from `(0,0)` to `(N-1, N-1)`:\n`+` indicates `(r+c)` is even, `-` indicates `(r+c)` is odd.\n`+-+-`\n`-+-+`\n`+-+-`\n`-+-+`\n\nFill `+` cells with `1, ..., 8`:\n`1 . 2 .`\n`. 3 . 4`\n`5 . 6 .`\n`. 7 . 8`\n\nFill `-` cells with `9, ..., 16`:\n`1  9  2 10`\n`11 3 12 4`\n`5 13 6 14`\n`15 7 16 8`\n\nLet's trace this board for `N=4`:\nStart at `1` (cell `(0,0)`).\n\n**Rook's Path:**\nCurrent: `(0,0)` (value 1).

Current: `(3,2)`. All cells visited. Stop.\nTotal `vuns_queen = 0`.\n\nFor this `N=4` board, `vuns_rook = 1`, `vuns_queen = 0`. This does not satisfy `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`. It's `1 < 0` which is false.\n\nThe example output for `N=4` is:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\nHere, `vuns_rook = 1` and `vuns_queen = 2`. This satisfies the condition.\nLet's analyze the example's pattern.\nNumber `1` is at `(2,1)`.\nNumbers `1` to `N*N` are split into two groups:\nGroup A: `1, 2, ..., ceil(N*N/2)`\nGroup B: `ceil(N*N/2)+1, ..., N*N`\n\nIn the example `N=4`, `N*N=16`, `ceil(N*N/2) = 8`.\nGroup A: `1..8`. Group B: `9..16`.\nThe board has a pattern where `1, 2, ..., N*N/2` are placed on one \"color\" (e.g., cells where `r+c` is even) and `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` on the other \"color\" (cells where `r+c` is odd). This is exactly what my initial strategy tried. The example output is not following this pattern.\n\nLet's re-examine the example's `N=4` output:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet's find the cells for `1` to `16`:\n`1: (2,1)`\n`2: (3,3)`\n`3: (0,1)`\n`4: (0,0)`\n`5: (1,1)`\n`6: (0,2)`\n`7: (1,0)`\n`8: (3,1)`\n`9: (1,2)`\n`10: (2,3)`\n`11: (2,2)`\n`12: (0,3)`\n`13: (3,0)`\n`14: (2,0)`\n`15: (1,3)`\n`16: (3,2)`\n\nThe key observation is that the rook cannot move diagonally, while the queen can. If we place the small numbers such that they are connected by diagonal moves but not by orthogonal moves, the queen might be able to follow the small numbers, while the rook gets stuck.\n\nConsider the cells `(r, c)` where `r` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). These cells are connected by queen's diagonal moves.\nConsider the cells `(r, c)` where `r` and `c` have different parity (one even, one odd). These cells are also connected by queen's diagonal moves.\nA rook cannot move between these two sets of cells using only diagonal moves.\n\nLet's try to put small numbers in cells where `r+c` is even, and large numbers in cells where `r+c` is odd.\nThis is the checkerboard pattern.\nCells `(r,c)` with `r+c` even: `(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)`\nCells `(r,c)` with `r+c` odd: `(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)`\n\nLet's fill the first set of cells with numbers `1, ..., N*N/2` and the second set with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nThe example's `N=4` output:\n`1` is at `(2,1)` (odd sum `2+1=3`).\n`2` is at `(3,3)` (even sum `3+3=6`).\n`3` is at `(0,1)` (odd sum `0+1=1`).\n`4` is at `(0,0)` (even sum `0+0=0`).\nThis strategy is mixing up the parity.\n\nThe example solution for `N=4` has `1` at `(2,1)`.\nThe path of the rook: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`. `vuns_rook = 1`.\nThe path of the queen: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`. `vuns_queen = 2`.\nThis works.\n\nLet's analyze the example solution's construction.\nThe cells `(r,c)` where `r` is even, `c` is odd, or `r` is odd, `c` is even. These are the \"white\" cells on a checkerboard if `(0,0)` is \"black\".\nThe cells `(r,c)` where `r` is even, `c` is even, or `r` is odd, `c` is odd. These are the \"black\" cells.\n\nIn the example solution for `N=4`:\nCells `(r,c)` with `r+c` even (black cells): `(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)`\nValues: `4, 6, 5, 15, 14, 11, 8, 2`\nCells `(r,c)` with `r+c` odd (white cells): `(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)`\nValues: `3, 12, 7, 9, 1, 10, 13, 16`\n\nIt seems the example solution puts `1` on a \"white\" cell `(2,1)`.\nThe numbers `1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 16, 12, 10` are on \"white\" cells.\nThe numbers `2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14, 15` are on \"black\" cells.\n\nThe small numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8` are distributed across both \"colors\".\n`1` (white), `2` (black), `3` (white), `4` (black), `5` (black), `6` (black), `7` (white), `8` (black).\n\nThe key insight might be simpler:\nFor `N=1`, output `-1` (as 0 is not strictly less than 0).\nFor `N > 1`:\nThe rook can only move between cells `(r,c)` and `(r',c')` if `r=r'` or `c=c'`.\nThe queen can also move if `|r-r'| = |c-c'|`.\n\nConsider a simple pattern:\nFill the first `N*N/2` cells (e.g., `(r,c)` where `r` is even, `c` is even, or `r` is odd, `c` is odd) with numbers `1, 2, ..., N*N/2`.\nFill the remaining `N*N - N*N/2` cells (e.g., `(r,c)` where `r` is even, `c` is odd, or `r` is odd, `c` is even) with numbers `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\n\nLet's try this with `N=4`. `N*N/2 = 8`.\n`board[r][c]` for `r,c` from `0` to `N-1`.\n`r+c` is even: `(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)`\n`r+c` is odd: `(0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)`\n\nFill `r+c` even with `1..8`:\n`board[0][0] = 1`\n`board[0][2] = 2`\n`board[1][1] = 3`\n`board[1][3] = 4`\n`board[2][0] = 5`\n`board[2][2] = 6`\n`board[3][1] = 7`\n`board[3][3] = 8`\n\nFill `r+c` odd with `9..16`:\n`board[0][1] = 9`\n`board[0][3] = 10`\n`board[1][0] = 11`\n`board[1][2] = 12`\n`board[2][1] = 13`\n`board[2][3] = 14`\n`board[3][0] = 15`\n`board[3][2] = 16`\n\nResulting board:\n`1  9  2 10`\n`11 3 12 4`\n`5 13 6 14`\n`15 7 16 8`\n\nThis is the board I manually traced above, which resulted in `vuns_rook = 1`, `vuns_queen = 0`. This is not `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`.\n\nThe problem is that `1` is on an even-sum cell `(0,0)`.\nIf `1` is on an even-sum cell, all cells reachable by a rook in one move from `1` will also be on even-sum cells (or odd-sum cells if `N` is small and `1` is near border).\nNo, that's incorrect. If `1` is at `(0,0)`, a rook can go to `(0,1)` or `(1,0)`. Both `(0,1)` and `(1,0)` are odd-sum cells. So the rook can move between even-sum and odd-sum cells.\n\nThe example solution for `N=4` has `1` at `(2,1)`, which is an odd-sum cell.\nLet's try to put `1` on an odd-sum cell, and then fill the odd-sum cells with `1, ..., N*N/2` and even-sum cells with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nThis is just swapping the two sets of numbers in my previous attempt.\nLet `odd_sum_cells` be filled with `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nLet `even_sum_cells` be filled with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\n\nFor `N=4`:\n`board[0][1] = 1`\n`board[0][3] = 2`\n`board[1][0] = 3`\n`board[1][2] = 4`\n`board[2][1] = 5`\n`board[2][3] = 6`\n`board[3][0] = 7`\n`board[3][2] = 8`\n\n`board[0][0] = 9`\n`board[0][2] = 10`\n`board[1][1] = 11`\n`board[1][3] = 12`\n`board[2][0] = 13`\n`board[2][2] = 14`\n`board[3][1] = 15`\n`board[3][3] = 16`\n\nResulting board:\n`9  1 10 2`\n`3 11 4 12`\n`13 5 14 6`\n`7 15 8 16`\n\nLet's trace this board for `N=4`.

Current: `(3,3)`. All cells visited. Stop.\nTotal `vuns_queen = 0`.\n\nAgain, `vuns_rook = 1`, `vuns_queen = 0`. This does not work. My simple checkerboard pattern always results in `vuns_rook >= vuns_queen`. This is because the queen can always reach more cells. If the rook is stuck, the queen might not be. If the queen is stuck, the rook must also be stuck. So, `vuns_rook` can be greater than `vuns_queen` only if the queen gets stuck when the rook is not, which is impossible. Or if the queen gets stuck and pays a vun, but then the rook (which would also be stuck) has already paid a vun for that same 'stuck' situation.\n\nThe only way `vuns_rook < vuns_queen` can happen is if the sequence of visited cells somehow causes the queen to visit a set of cells that makes *it* stuck, while the rook's path leads to a different configuration where it is not stuck. This is not possible because the choice is always the minimal unvisited number. The sequence of cells visited up to `k` will be `1, 2, ..., k`. Both pieces visit the same set of numbers, just in a different order.\n\nLet `S_k = {1, ..., k}` be the set of numbers visited.\nLet `C_p` be the current cell of piece `p`.\nLet `U = {k+1, ..., N*N}` be the set of unvisited numbers.\nLet `R_reachable(C_rook)` be unvisited cells reachable by rook from `C_rook`.\nLet `Q_reachable(C_queen)` be unvisited cells reachable by queen from `C_queen`.\n\nIf `min(val for cell, val in R_reachable(C_rook)) > min(val for cell, val in Q_reachable(C_queen))`, then the queen will pick a smaller number. This can lead to different paths. This is the key.\n\nThe example output for `N=4` has `1` at `(2,1)`.\nRook path: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`\nQueen path: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`\n\nLet's look at the point where their paths diverge:\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 4`. Current `(0,0)`. Visited ` {1,3,4} `.\n   Reachable from `(0,0)`: `(0,1)` (3, visited), `(0,2)` (6), `(0,3)` (12), `(1,0)` (7), `(2,0)` (14), `(3,0)` (13).\n   Smallest unvisited: `6`. Rook moves `4 -> 6`.\n\nQueen: `1 -> 3 -> 4`. Current `(0,0)`. Visited ` {1,3,4} `.\n   Reachable from `(0,0)`: `(0,1)` (3, visited), `(0,2)` (6), `(0,3)` (12), `(1,0)` (7), `(2,0)` (14), `(3,0)` (13), `(1,1)` (5), `(2,2)` (11), `(3,3)` (2).\n   Smallest unvisited: `2`. Queen moves `4 -> 2`.\n\nThis is the divergence! The queen, having diagonal moves, can reach `2` at `(3,3)`, which is smaller than `6` (the smallest reachable for rook).\nThis is exactly what we need. The queen takes a smaller number, which potentially leads it to a \"bad\" region earlier.\n\nThe strategy:\n1.  Place `1` somewhere.\n2.  Place `2` such that it's reachable by queen but not by rook from `1`.\n3.  Place `3` such that it's reachable by both from `1`.\n4.  This way, the queen will go `1 -> 2`, while the rook goes `1 -> 3`. Their paths diverge.\n\nConsider `N=1`. Output `-1`.\nFor `N > 1`:\nWe need to construct a board. Let's try to generalize the example's pattern.\nThe example output for `N=4` seems to put numbers `1` to `N*N/2` (8 for N=4) in the top-left quadrant (`N/2 x N/2` cells) and the bottom-right quadrant (`N/2 x N/2` cells). And `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` in the other two quadrants. No, this isn't quite right.\n\nLet's simplify.\nWe need `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`.\nThis means the queen must get stuck at least one more time than the rook.\nThe queen gets stuck if all reachable cells are visited.\nThe rook gets stuck if all reachable cells are visited.\n\nIf `N` is odd, `N*N` is odd. `N*N/2` is not an integer. Let `K = (N*N + 1) / 2`.\nIf `N` is even, `N*N` is even. `K = N*N / 2`.\n\nLet's consider cells `(r,c)` where `r < N/2`. These are the \"top\" rows.\nLet's consider cells `(r,c)` where `r >= N/2`. These are the \"bottom\" rows.\n\nLet's try to fill the cells in the top-left `N/2 x N/2` quadrant and bottom-right `N/2 x N/2` quadrant with `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nAnd the top-right `N/2 x N/2` and bottom-left `N/2 x N/2` quadrants with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nThis is essentially splitting the board into two sets of `N*N/2` cells.\nSet A: `(r,c)` where `(r < N/2 \\land c < N/2)` or `(r >= N/2 \\land c >= N/2)`.\nSet B: `(r < N/2 \\land c >= N/2)` or `(r >= N/2 \\land c < N/2)`.\n\nLet `count_small = 0`, `count_large = N*N/2`.\nCreate an `N x N` board.\nIterate `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`.\nIf `(r < N/2 and c < N/2)` or `(r >= N/2 and c >= N/2)`:\n  `board[r][c] = count_small + 1`\n  `count_small += 1`\nElse:\n  `board[r][c] = count_large + 1`\n  `count_large += 1`\n\nLet's try this for `N=4`. `N/2 = 2`. `N*N/2 = 8`.\nSmall numbers: `1..8`. Large numbers: `9..16`.\n`r < 2, c < 2`: `(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)` (top-left)\n`r >= 2, c >= 2`: `(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)` (bottom-right)\nFill these 8 cells with `1..8`.\n\n`r < 2, c >= 2`: `(0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3)` (top-right)\n`r >= 2, c < 2`: `(2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1)` (bottom-left)\nFill these 8 cells with `9..16`.\n\nBoard:\n`1  2  9 10`\n`3  4 11 12`\n`13 14 5  6`\n`15 16 7  8`\n\nLet's trace this for `N=4`.

This is \"far\" from `1` at `(2,1)`.\nThe rook takes `6` at `(0,2)`.\nThis means the small numbers are scattered.\n\nThe problem states `1 <= N <= 500`.\nFor `N=1`, the answer is `-1`. (0 vuns for both, not strictly less).\n\nFor `N > 1`:\nLet's try to make the small numbers `1, ..., N*N/2` fill a \"diagonal\" pattern.\nThe example output for `N=4` has a specific structure.\nSmall numbers (1 to 8): `4,3,6,7,5,1,8,2`\nLarge numbers (9 to 16): `12,15,9,14,11,10,13,16`\nThe small numbers are somewhat clustered in the top-left and bottom-right.\n`1` is at `(2,1)`. `2` is at `(3,3)`. `3` is at `(0,1)`. `4` is at `(0,0)`.\n\nWhat if we fill the board in a specific order?\nTry filling the cells `(r,c)` where `r` is even with small numbers, and `r` is odd with large numbers.\nNo, that's too simple.\n\nThe example output for `N=4` is:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet's look at the cells with numbers `1` to `N*N/2` (which is 8 for `N=4`).\n`1: (2,1)`\n`2: (3,3)`\n`3: (0,1)`\n`4: (0,0)`\n`5: (1,1)`\n`6: (0,2)`\n`7: (1,0)`\n`8: (3,1)`\n\nThese cells form a pattern where they are mostly on a \"diagonal\" band, or checkerboard-like.\nThe cells where `r+c` is even (black): `(0,0) (0,2) (1,1) (1,3) (2,0) (2,2) (3,1) (3,3)`\nNumbers in these cells: `4, 6, 5, 15, 14, 11, 8, 2`\nThe cells where `r+c` is odd (white): `(0,1) (0,3) (1,0) (1,2) (2,1) (2,3) (3,0) (3,2)`\nNumbers in these cells: `3, 12, 7, 9, 1, 10, 13, 16`\n\nThe example solution puts `1` on a white cell `(2,1)`.\nThe numbers `1, 3, 7` are on white cells. `2, 4, 5, 6, 8` are on black cells.\nIt seems that the small numbers are distributed such that the queen can jump to a smaller number, but this smaller number is on a cell that is not orthogonally reachable from the current one.\n\nLet's try this pattern:\nFill the first `N*N/2` cells with `1, ..., N*N/2` by alternating between the two \"colors\" of a checkerboard.\nAnd the remaining `N*N/2` cells with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` by alternating between the two \"colors\".\n\nSpecifically, let's fill `N*N/2` \"black\" cells (where `r+c` is even) with `1, 3, 5, ...`\nAnd `N*N/2` \"white\" cells (where `r+c` is odd) with `2, 4, 6, ...`\nThis way, `1` is on a black cell. `2` is on a white cell. `3` is on a black cell.\nThe queen can move from a black cell to a white cell diagonally. The rook cannot.\n\nLet `board` be an `N x N` matrix.\n`even_cells = []`\n`odd_cells = []`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r+c) % 2 == 0`:\n      `even_cells.append((r,c))`\n    Else:\n      `odd_cells.append((r,c))`\n\n`num_even = len(even_cells)`\n`num_odd = len(odd_cells)`\n\nFill `board`:\n`small_num = 1`\n`large_num = N*N`\n\nIf `num_even >= num_odd`: (This is true for `N*N` total cells, `N` even or odd. `(N*N + (N%2))` even cells, `(N*N - (N%2))` odd cells)\n  Iterate `(r,c)` in `even_cells`:\n    `board[r][c] = small_num`\n    `small_num += 2`\n  Iterate `(r,c)` in `odd_cells`:\n    `board[r][c] = large_num`\n    `large_num -= 2`\n  `small_num = 2`\n  Iterate `(r,c)` in `odd_cells`:\n    If `board[r][c]` is not yet filled (this happens if `num_even > num_odd`):\n      `board[r][c] = small_num`\n      `small_num += 2`\n  `large_num = N*N - 1`\n  Iterate `(r,c)` in `even_cells`:\n    If `board[r][c]` is not yet filled:\n      `board[r][c] = large_num`\n      `large_num -= 2`\nThis is too complicated. Let's simplify.\n\nThere are `ceil(N*N/2)` cells of one color and `floor(N*N/2)` cells of the other color.\nLet's call the color of `(0,0)` \"black\" (sum `r+c` is even).\nLet `k = N*N/2`.\nFill the `k` \"black\" cells with `1, ..., k`.\nFill the `N*N - k` \"white\" cells with `k+1, ..., N*N`.\n\nThis is the checkerboard pattern I tried earlier, which resulted in `vuns_rook = 1`, `vuns_queen = 0` for `N=4`. It means this pattern `vuns_rook >= vuns_queen` and not `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`.\n\nThe example solution is the only working one for `N=4`.\nWhat if `N=2`? Output:\n`1 4`\n`3 2`\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4`. 0 vuns.\nQueen: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`. 0 vuns.\nCondition `0 < 0` is false. So `N=2` might also be `-1`.\nThe problem states `N=1` is `-1`. The example output for `N=4` is a specific solution. What about `N=2,3`?\nIf `N=2`, `N*N=4`.\n`board[0][0]` `board[0][1]`\n`board[1][0]` `board[1][1]`\n`1` must be placed somewhere. Let `1` be at `(0,0)`.\nRook from `(0,0)` can reach `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.\nQueen from `(0,0)` can reach `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, and `(1,1)`.\nThe queen always has more or equal options.\nIf `N=2`, the number of cells is small, paths are short.\nIt seems hard to make `vuns_rook < vuns_queen` for small `N`.\n\nMaybe the solution only exists for `N >= 4`.\nThe example states `N=1` does not have solution.\nThe problem statement says `1 <= N <= 500`.\n\nLet's re-examine the example `N=4` output:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet's divide the board into two halves: top `N/2` rows and bottom `N/2` rows.\nFor `N=4`, top two rows: `(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)` and `(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)`.\nBottom two rows: `(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)` and `(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)`.\n\nValues in top half: `4,3,6,12,7,5,9,15`.

Current: `(0,0)`. All cells visited. Stop.\nTotal `vuns_queen = 1`.\n\nFor this pattern, `vuns_rook = 2`, `vuns_queen = 1`. This satisfies `vuns_rook > vuns_queen`.\nThis is `2 > 1`, so `vuns_rook` is NOT strictly less than `vuns_queen`. It's strictly greater.\nWe need `vuns_rook < vuns_queen`.\n\nThis implies my reasoning that `vuns_rook` is always `>= vuns_queen` is correct, and the problem asks for the opposite.\nThis means the only way is if the *example* output is the one to follow, and it's a special case, or my detailed tracing of the example solution was wrong.\n\nLet's re-check the example output trace for `N=4`.\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`. `vuns_rook = 1`.\nQueen: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`. `vuns_queen = 2`.\nThis is `1 < 2`, which means rook pays strictly less. So the example output *does* work.\nMy earlier analysis of the example was correct.\n\nThe key divergence was:\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 4`. Current `(0,0)`. Visited ` {1,3,4} `. Smallest reachable for rook is `6`.\nQueen: `1 -> 3 -> 4`. Current `(0,0)`. Visited ` {1,3,4} `. Smallest reachable for queen is `2`.\nThe queen takes `2` at `(3,3)`. The rook takes `6` at `(0,2)`.\n\nThis means the queen's path leads it to get stuck more often. How?\nThe queen jumps to `2` at `(3,3)`. This cell is `(N-1, N-1)`. It's a corner.\nFrom `(3,3)`, the queen can reach `(0,0), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)`.\nMany of these cells are already visited by the queen's path.\n`1` at `(2,1)`\n`3` at `(0,1)`\n`4` at `(0,0)`\n`2` at `(3,3)`\n`5` at `(1,1)`\n`6` at `(0,2)`\n`9` at `(1,2)`\n`7` at `(1,0)`\n`13` at `(3,0)`\n`8` at `(3,1)`\n`11` at `(2,2)`\n`10` at `(2,3)`\n`12` at `(0,3)`\n`15` at `(1,3)`\n`14` at `(2,0)`\n`16` at `(3,2)`\n\nThe example solution for `N=4` is not following a simple checkerboard or quadrant division.\nIt places `1` in the middle of the bottom half. `(2,1)`.\nIt places `2` at the bottom-right corner. `(3,3)`.\nIt places `3` at the top-middle. `(0,1)`.\nIt places `4` at the top-left corner. `(0,0)`.\n\nThis specific arrangement seems to be key.\nThe top-left `N/2 x N/2` block and bottom-right `N/2 x N/2` block can be considered \"main\" blocks.\nThe other two blocks are \"cross\" blocks.\n\nLet `k = N*N`.\nLet's try to fill `N*N/2` cells with `1, ..., N*N/2` and the remaining `N*N/2` cells with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nThe example places `1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8` in the first `N*N/2` values. `2` is also in this group.\nThe example board is actually very simple:\nIt fills the first `N*N/2` cells (in reading order) with `N*N` down to `N*N - N*N/2 + 1`.\nAnd the remaining `N*N/2` cells with `1` up to `N*N/2`.\nNo, that's not it either.\n\nWhat if we fill the board in a snake-like pattern?\nOr just fill the first `N/2` rows with small numbers and the second `N/2` rows with large numbers.\nNo, I tried this and it didn't work.\n\nThe example `N=4` solution is the only one given. What if this pattern works for all `N`?\n`N=1` is `-1`.\nFor `N >= 2`:\nLet's divide `N x N` board into 4 sub-squares of size `N/2 x N/2`. (Assume `N` is even for now).\nTop-Left (TL): `(0..N/2-1, 0..N/2-1)`\nTop-Right (TR): `(0..N/2-1, N/2..N-1)`\nBottom-Left (BL): `(N/2..N-1, 0..N/2-1)`\nBottom-Right (BR): `(N/2..N-1, N/2..N-1)`\n\nExample `N=4`:\nTL: `(0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1)` values `4,3,7,5`\nTR: `(0,2) (0,3) (1,2) (1,3)` values `6,12,9,15`\nBL: `(2,0) (2,1) (3,0) (3,1)` values `14,1,13,8`\nBR: `(2,2) (2,3) (3,2) (3,3)` values `11,10,16,2`\n\nIt looks like the strategy is to put the smallest numbers in BL and BR, and largest in TL and TR.\nSpecifically:\n`1` is in BL. `2` is in BR. `3` is in TL. `4` is in TL.\nThis is not a simple quadrant fill.\n\nLet `board` be `N x N`.\n`count = 1`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r+c)%2 == 0`:\n      `board[r][c] = count`\n      `count += 1`\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r+c)%2 != 0`:\n      `board[r][c] = count`\n      `count += 1`\n\nThis is the checkerboard pattern where all even-sum cells are filled first, then all odd-sum cells.\nThis means `1, ..., ceil(N*N/2)` are on even-sum cells and `ceil(N*N/2)+1, ..., N*N` are on odd-sum cells.\nI traced this for `N=4` and got `vuns_rook=1, vuns_queen=0`. Still not working.\n\nThe solution must be something very simple that works for all `N`.\nThe example output for `N=4` is:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet's consider `N*N` cells.\nHalf of them will be `(r,c)` where `r+c` is even.\nHalf of them will be `(r,c)` where `r+c` is odd.\n(If `N*N` is odd, one group will have one more cell).\n\nLet's fill the cells `(r,c)` where `r+c` is even with `1, 2, ..., ceil(N*N/2)`.\nAnd the cells `(r,c)` where `r+c` is odd with `ceil(N*N/2)+1, ..., N*N`.\nThis is my first checkerboard pattern. It didn't work.\n\nWhat if we fill the cells `(r,c)` where `r+c` is odd with `1, 2, ..., ceil(N*N/2)`.\nAnd the cells `(r,c)` where `r+c` is even with `ceil(N*N/2)+1, ..., N*N`.\nThis is the second checkerboard pattern I tried. It didn't work either.\n\nThe problem for `N=1` is `-1`.\nFor `N=2`, let's try to construct one.\n`1 2`\n`3 4`\nRook: `1->2->4->3`. 0 vuns.\nQueen: `1->2->3->4`. 0 vuns.\n`0 < 0` is false.\n\n`1 3`\n`2 4`\nRook: `1->2->4->3`. 0 vuns.\nQueen: `1->2->3->4`. 0 vuns.\n`0 < 0` is false.\n\nIt feels like `N=2,3` also don't have a solution.\nIf `N` is small, the board is too connected.\nThe example output for `N=4` is the *only* hint.\nIt seems to be a specific construction for `N >= 4`.\nFor `N=2,3`, it might be `-1`.\n\nLet's test `N=3`. `N*N=9`.\n`1 2 3`\n`4 5 6`\n`7 8 9`\nRook: `1->2->3->6->9->8->7->4->5`. 0 vuns.\nQueen: `1->2->3->6->9->5->4->7->8`. 0 vuns.\n\nThis problem looks like it has a specific construction that works for `N >= 4`.\nThe example solution for `N=4` is:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nThis board can be generated by filling numbers `1` to `N*N/2` into `N*N/2` cells, and `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` into the other `N*N/2` cells.\nThe pattern for the example solution is:\nFill cells `(r,c)` with `r < N/2` and `c < N/2` (top-left) with some numbers.\nFill cells `(r,c)` with `r < N/2` and `c >= N/2` (top-right) with some numbers.\nFill cells `(r,c)` with `r >= N/2` and `c < N/2` (bottom-left) with some numbers.\nFill cells `(r,c)` with `r >= N/2` and `c >= N/2` (bottom-right) with some numbers.\n\nLet's take `N=4`. `N/2 = 2`.\nCells in TL: `(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)`\nCells in TR: `(0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3)`\nCells in BL: `(2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1)`\nCells in BR: `(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)`\n\nNumbers `1` to `N*N/2` (`1..8`) are placed in BL and BR.\n`1` in BL, `2` in BR, `8` in BL.\nNumbers `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` (`9..16`) are placed in TL and TR.\n`9` in TR, `10` in BR, `11` in BR, `12` in TR.\n\nThis is the pattern:\nFill `board[r][c]` for `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`.\n`small_val = 1`\n`large_val = N*N/2 + 1`\n\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r+c)` is even:  (These are the \"black\" cells)\n      `board[r][c] = large_val`\n      `large_val += 1`\n    Else:  (These are the \"white\" cells)\n      `board[r][c] = small_val`\n      `small_val += 1`\n\nThis is the checkerboard pattern where even-sum cells get large numbers, odd-sum cells get small numbers.\nThis is exactly the pattern I traced for `N=4` which yielded `vuns_rook=1, vuns_queen=0`.\nThis is `vuns_rook > vuns_queen` which is not what we want.\n\nThe example output's `1` is at `(2,1)` (odd sum).\nThe example output's `2` is at `(3,3)` (even sum).\nThe example output's `3` is at `(0,1)` (odd sum).\nThe example output's `4` is at `(0,0)` (even sum).\n\nThis means the small numbers are mixed between odd-sum and even-sum cells.\nThis is critical. The `1` is on an odd-sum cell, `2` is on an even-sum cell.\nA rook cannot go from `(2,1)` to `(3,3)` in one move.\nA queen can go from `(2,1)` to `(3,2)` (rook move) or `(3,0)` (diag) or `(1,0)` (diag) etc.\nBut the queen can also go `(2,1) -> (3,3)` by `(2,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)` (2 moves).\nOr `(2,1) -> (1,2) -> (3,3)` (2 moves).\n\nThe example is very specific.\nIt fills the board in a specific way:\nIt fills the top-left `N/2 x N/2` block and the bottom-right `N/2 x N/2` block with numbers `N*N/2+1` to `N*N`.\nIt fills the top-right `N/2 x N/2` block and the bottom-left `N/2 x N/2` block with numbers `1` to `N*N/2`.\nThis is the pattern I traced earlier, which resulted in `vuns_rook=1, vuns_queen=0`.\n\nThe only way the example output works is if my manual trace of it was correct.\nLet's look at the actual example trace values:\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`.\nQueen: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`.\n\nThe key divergence point:\n`1 -> 3 -> 4`. Current `(0,0)`. Visited `{1,3,4}`.\nRook's options from `(0,0)`: `(0,2)` (6), `(1,0)` (7), `(2,0)` (14), `(3,0)` (13). Min is `6`. Rook moves to `6`.\nQueen's options from `(0,0)`: `(0,2)` (6), `(1,0)` (7), `(2,0)` (14), `(3,0)` (13), `(1,1)` (5), `(2,2)` (11), `(3,3)` (2). Min is `2`. Queen moves to `2`.\n\nThis is the crucial step. The queen takes `2` at `(3,3)`. The rook takes `6` at `(0,2)`.\nThis makes the queen's path visit a cell `2` that is \"far away\" and isolated from other small numbers.\nWhen the queen gets to `(3,3)` (value `2`), its future moves are constrained.\nFrom `(3,3)` (value `2`), queen can reach `(0,0)` (4, visited), `(0,3)` (12), `(1,1)` (5), `(1,2)` (9), `(2,1)` (1, visited), `(2,2)` (11), `(3,0)` (13), `(3,1)` (8), `(3,2)` (16).\nSmallest unvisited: `5` at `(1,1)`.\nSo queen's path continues `... -> 4 -> 2 -> 5`.\n\nThe pattern for the example output is:\nFill the top `N/2` rows with numbers `N*N/2+1` to `N*N` (decreasingly).\nFill the bottom `N/2` rows with numbers `1` to `N*N/2` (increasingly).\nNo, this is not the example.\nThe example output for `N=4` has `1` at `(2,1)` and `2` at `(3,3)`.\nIt has `3` at `(0,1)` and `4` at `(0,0)`.\n\nLet's try this:\nFill `N/2` rows with `1, ..., N*N/2`.\nFill the other `N/2` rows with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N`.\nThis is the simple top/bottom half split.\n`N=4`:\n`1 2 3 4`\n`5 6 7 8`\n`9 10 11 12`\n`13 14 15 16`\nRook: `1->2->3->4->8->7->6->5->9->10->11->12->16->15->14->13`. 0 vuns.\nQueen: `1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11->12->13->14->15->16`. 0 vuns.\nThis is `0 < 0`, false.\n\nThe problem implies there is a solution for `N >= 4`.\nThe sample solution for `N=4` is the key.\nIt seems to fill the board with `N*N/2` numbers in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants (using a specific order), and the other `N*N/2` numbers in the top-right and bottom-left quadrants (using another specific order).\n\nLet `k = N*N/2`.\nLet `board` be `N x N`.\n`current_small = 1`\n`current_large = k + 1`\n\nFor `r` from `0` to `N-1`:\n  For `c` from `0` to `N-1`:\n    If `(r < N/2 and c < N/2)` or `(r >= N/2 and c >= N/2)`: (These are the \"main diagonal\" blocks)\n      `board[r][c] = current_large`\n      `current_large += 1`\n    Else: (These are the \"anti-diagonal\" blocks)\n      `board[r][c] = current_small`\n      `current_small += 1`\n\nThis would be:\n`9 10 1 2`\n`11 12 3 4`\n`5 6 13 14`\n`7 8 15 16`\n\nLet's trace this for `N=4`.

Visited: `{1..9}`.\n\nIn this scenario, both rook and queen pay 1 vun. `1 < 1` is false.\n\nIt seems the only way is to reproduce the example output for `N=4` and generalize it.\nThe example output for `N=4` is:\n`4 3 6 12`\n`7 5 9 15`\n`14 1 11 10`\n`13 8 16 2`\n\nLet's try to fill the board with numbers `1, ..., N*N/2` in the cells `(r,c)` where `r+c` is odd.\nAnd numbers `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` in the cells `(r,c)` where `r+c` is even.\nThis is my second checkerboard pattern. It didn't work.\n\nThe example solution for `N=4` shows a specific pattern that works.\nIf `N=1`, print `-1`.\nFor `N > 1`:\nLet's try to fill the board by iterating `r` from `0` to `N-1`, `c` from `0` to `N-1`.\nIf `(r < N/2 && c < N/2)` or `(r >= N/2 && c >= N/2)`: (main diagonal blocks)\n  Fill these cells with numbers `N*N/2 + 1, ..., N*N` (in increasing order).\nElse: (anti-diagonal blocks)\n  Fill these cells with numbers `1, ..., N*N/2` (in increasing order).\n\nThis is the pattern that results in:\n`9 10 1 2`\n`11 12 3 4`\n`5 6 13 14`\n`7 8 15 16`\nThis resulted in `vuns_rook = 1, vuns_queen = 1`. Not strictly less.\n\nThe only remaining option is that the problem expects us to literally output the example solution for `N=4`, and for other `N` values, there might not be a solution or a similar pattern is not obvious.\nHowever, competitive programming problems usually have a general solution.\nWhat if the solution is simply filling the first `N*N/2` cells of the board with `N*N/2+1, ..., N*N` and the remaining `N*N/2` cells with `1, ..., N*N/2`?\nThis is filling the board in reading order.\n`N=4`:\n`9 10 11 12`\n`13 14 15 16`\n`1 2 3 4`\n`5 6 7 8`\n\nRook: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> (vun) -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> (vun) -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16`. `vuns_rook = 2`.\nQueen: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> (vun) -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> (vun) -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16`. `vuns_queen = 2`.\nStill `vuns_rook = vuns_queen`.\n\nThe only case where `vuns_rook < vuns_queen` is if the queen gets stuck, but the rook does not. This is impossible.\nThe other case is if the queen gets stuck `X` times, and the rook gets stuck `Y` times, where `Y < X`.\nThis means when the rook gets stuck, the queen *must* also get stuck.\nBut when the queen gets stuck, the rook *must* also get stuck.\nSo `vuns_rook == vuns_queen` always.\n\nThis implies that the problem statement is misinterpreted, or there's a subtle trick.\n\"Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number.\"\n\"If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of 1 vun.\"\n\nLet's re-read the example trace carefully.\nRook: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 13 -> 2 -> 8 -> 16 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14`.\nQueen: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 7 -> 13 -> 8 -> 11 -> 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> (1 vun) -> 14 -> (1 vun) -> 16`.\n\nThe rook pays 1 vun when it's at `15` (cell `(1,3)`). All reachable cells from `(1,3)` (rook moves) are visited. Smallest unvisited is `14` at `(2,0)`.\nThe queen pays 1 vun when it's at `15` (cell `(1,3)`). All reachable cells from `(1,3)` (queen moves) are visited. Smallest unvisited is `14` at `(2,0)`.\nSo, at this point, both pay 1 vun. `vuns_rook = 1`, `vuns_queen = 1`.\nThen they both teleport to `14` at `(2,0)`.\nRook path continues `... -> 15 -> (vun) -> 14`.\nQueen path continues `... -> 15 -> (vun) -> 14`.\n\nNow, both are at `14` at `(2,0)`.\nRook's turn. Visited for rook: `{1..13, 15, 14}`. Unvisited: `16`.\nFrom `(2,0)`: reachable for rook: `(0,0)` (4, visited), `(1,0)` (7, visited), `(2,1)` (1, visited), `(2,2)` (11, visited), `(2,3)` (10, visited), `(3,0)` (13, visited). All reachable are visited.\nSmallest unvisited is `16` at `(3,2)`.\nRook pays 1 vun. `vuns_rook = 2`.
