Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the Vanya and Lanterns Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Vanya and Lanterns problem to tackle, and it's all about minimizing the radius of light coverage.  First, let's break down the core of it.  We have a street of length `l`, and `n` lanterns at positions `a_i`. Each lantern has a light radius, `d`, and lights up a segment around it. The goal is to find the *smallest* `d` that ensures the *entire street* from 0 to `l` is lit.\n\nMy thought process is focusing on covering *every* point on the street.  If every point `x` is lit, that means for any `x`, there's a lantern `a_i` within a distance `d`:  `|x - a_i| <= d`. That's the fundamental condition.\n\nHere's my strategy:\n\nFirst, sorting the lantern positions is a no-brainer. It will makes comparisons easier. So, sort the `a_i` values. Let's call them `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` after sorting.\n\nNow, let's look for the *unlit gaps*.\n\n1.  **The Beginning:**  The segment from 0 to `a_1` needs to be covered. The nearest lantern to 0 is at `a_1`. To illuminate the start of the street, `d` must be at least `a_1`. So, `d >= a_1`.\n\n2.  **The End:** The segment from `a_n` to `l` must be covered.  Similarly, `d` must be at least `l - a_n`. So, `d >= l - a_n`.\n\n3.  **Between Lanterns:**  This is the trickiest part. Consider two adjacent lanterns `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`.  The most vulnerable point is in the middle of these lanterns. The gap, if any, between `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` will be covered by the radius of at least one of these two lanterns. They either overlap or touch.  To ensure no gaps, the distance between them, `a_{i+1} - a_i`, must be covered by the combined coverage of both lanterns. The most the radius of one of the lanterns can be is half the distance: `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`.  I need to find the *maximum* of these half-distances between all adjacent lantern pairs.\n\nThe minimal `d` is then going to be the *maximum* of all these constraints:\n\n`d_min = max(a_1, l - a_n, (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2 for all i from 1 to n-1)`\n\nSo, in essence, I need to calculate `a_1`, `l - a_n`, and `(a_{i+1} - a_i)/2` for all adjacent pairs and pick the biggest one. That's my minimum radius.\n\nFor that second sample input, `n = 2, l = 5, a = [2, 5]`.\nI have `a_1 = 2`, `l - a_n = 0`, and the distance is 3, so `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2 = 1.5`\nThe result would be 2. So the minimal `d` is going to be `2`.\n\nNow, let's get that Python script written!\n",
