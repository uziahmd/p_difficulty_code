Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Okay, let's break this down.**\n\nI'm tackling this \"Flawed Flow\" problem, and my initial thought is that the given graph, along with edge flows, presents a classic flow problem, but with some very specific constraints.  I'm looking for a Python solution, but before jumping into code, I need to fully understand the problem's nuances.\n\nFirst, the core requirement is to direct the flow on each edge. We're given the flow volumes, not the capacities. The flow conservation rule has to hold for every node except the source (node 1) and the sink (node n). The source has no incoming flow, and the resulting directed graph needs to be acyclic. The part that's throwing me is the \"correct maximum flow\" part.  I'm suspecting this isn't about actually finding a *maximum* flow but more about directing the given flows in a valid and consistent way.  The problem states \"find the direction\", implying the magnitudes are fixed.  So, I'm going to assume that the 'maximum flow' aspect is there more for context and that a valid solution *exists* based on the given flow values.  Essentially, the values provided align with a possible maximum flow, and we just need to ensure the directions are sound.\n\nThe constraints give me some helpful implications: The source must only have outgoing flow, and the sink effectively \"absorbs\" all the incoming flow. The \"no cycles\" condition is the biggest clue.  This screams \"topological sort\" to me. If we can ensure the directed graph is a DAG, we can order the nodes and direct the flow in a way that aligns with this ordering. Flow should generally move \"forward\" along the topological ordering.\n\nThinking about max-flow theory, the \"no cycles\" stipulation is unusual but makes sense in this context.  A max flow can decompose into paths and cycles, but since we're *forbidden* cycles, all the flow has to be a bunch of source-to-sink paths. This strongly suggests a topological ordering is key, and all flow should be pushed towards the sink. This also implies we have to be careful with the source and the sink, because this is our entry and exit to the graph. The no cycles constraint helps me to clarify that we are dealing with a Directed Acyclic Graph.\n\nSo, the focus is on achieving flow conservation, ensuring the source has only outgoing edges, maintaining acyclicity, and finding a valid direction for each edge that respects the given flow values and these conditions. A topological sort is likely going to be key to generating this direction. The maximum flow component is likely there to just give a bit of context, we need to make a valid graph and find direction.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to direct edges of a given undirected graph, each with a specified flow volume `c_i`, such that several conditions are met:\n1.  For any vertex `v` (1 < `v` < `n`), the total incoming flow equals the total outgoing flow (flow conservation).\n2.  Vertex 1 (source) has no incoming edges.\n3.  The resulting directed graph has no cycles.\n4.  The flow should be a \"correct maximum flow\". (This implies a solution consistent with standard flow properties exists, and we just need to find *any* valid direction.)\n\nThe most restrictive condition is \"no cycles\". A directed graph with no cycles is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In a DAG, there must be at least one topological ordering of vertices. If we consider only edges with positive flow, then flow must always go \"forward\" according to some topological order.\n\nLet's define `demand[v]` for each vertex `v`. This represents the net flow that must leave `v`.\nInitially, for each edge `(u, v)` with flow `c`, we don't know the direction. If we assume `u -> v`, then `u` contributes `c` to its outgoing flow and `v` contributes `c` to its incoming flow. If `v -> u`, then `v` contributes `c` to its outgoing flow and `u` contributes `c` to its incoming flow.\n\nThe problem effectively asks us to assign a direction to each edge `(u, v)` with flow `c` such that:\n*   For `v` in `(2, ..., n-1)`: `sum(outgoing_flow_from_v) - sum(incoming_flow_to_v) = 0`.\n*   For `v = 1`: `sum(outgoing_flow_from_1) - sum(incoming_flow_to_1) > 0` (since it's a source and `sum(incoming_flow_to_1) = 0`).\n*   For `v = n`: `sum(outgoing_flow_from_n) - sum(incoming_flow_to_n) < 0` (since it's a sink and `sum(outgoing_flow_from_n) = 0`).\n\nConsider the total flow `F` from source 1 to sink `n`. This `F` is the sum of all `c_i` on edges leaving vertex 1. For any intermediate vertex `v`, the net flow `sum(outgoing) - sum(incoming)` must be 0. For the sink `n`, the net flow `sum(outgoing) - sum(incoming)` must be `-F`.\n\nWe can model this as a problem where each vertex `v` has a \"balance\" or \"deficit/surplus\". Let `balance[v]` be the sum of all `c_i` for edges incident to `v`. This is the total potential flow that `v` can either send or receive.\nIf an edge `(u, v)` with flow `c` is directed `u -> v`, then `u` sends `c` and `v` receives `c`.\nIf it's directed `v -> u`, then `v` sends `c` and `u` receives `c`.\n\nThe condition \"no cycles\" is key. A common strategy for DAGs is topological sort or processing vertices in a specific order. Since vertex 1 must only have outgoing edges, it's a good candidate to start from.\n\nLet's maintain for each vertex `v` a `current_incoming_flow[v]` and `current_outgoing_flow[v]`. Initially, both are 0.\nWe also need to keep track of the `demand[v]` for each vertex `v`. For `v` in `(2, ..., n-1)`, `demand[v]` is 0. For `v=1`, `demand[1]` is the total flow `F`. For `v=n`, `demand[n]` is `-F`.\nHowever, we don't know `F` yet. A simpler approach is to track `unbalanced_flow[v]`, which is `sum(incoming_flow) - sum(outgoing_flow)`. We want this to be 0 for intermediate vertices.\n\nConsider a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach.\nA crucial observation: if we process vertices in a specific order, say from source to sink, we can make local decisions.\nWhat if we process vertices in an order that allows us to satisfy flow conservation for intermediate nodes?\n\nLet's define `net_flow_out[v]` as the sum of `c_i` for edges directed `v -> neighbor` minus `c_i` for edges directed `neighbor -> v`. We want `net_flow_out[v] = 0` for `1 < v < n`.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" condition strongly suggests a topological ordering. Since vertex 1 has no incoming edges, it must be the start of any such ordering.\nLet's try a greedy approach using a queue (like Kahn's algorithm for topological sort).\nWe can maintain for each vertex `v` its `balance_needed[v]`. Initially, `balance_needed[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nWhen we decide to direct an edge `u -> v` with flow `c`:\n`balance_needed[u]` decreases by `c`.\n`balance_needed[v]` increases by `c`.\n\nThe total flow `F` from source to sink is not explicitly given, but it is the sum of flows on edges leaving vertex 1.\nLet's try to satisfy the flow conservation for intermediate vertices `v` (1 < `v` < `n`).\nFor each such vertex `v`, the sum of flow on edges *entering* `v` must equal the sum of flow on edges *leaving* `v`.\n\nWe can use a DFS-like approach to determine directions. Start a DFS from vertex 1.\nWhen we visit a vertex `u`, we try to satisfy its flow conservation.\nMaintain `current_flow_balance[v]` for each vertex `v`. This will be `sum(incoming_flow) - sum(outgoing_flow)` for edges whose directions have been decided.\nInitially, `current_flow_balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nWhen we direct an edge `u -> v` with flow `c`:\n`current_flow_balance[u] -= c`\n`current_flow_balance[v] += c`\n\nThe problem guarantees a solution exists. This implies that if we make \"locally correct\" decisions, we will find a global solution.\nThe \"no cycles\" condition is the hardest to enforce. If we always direct flow from a \"higher\" topological order vertex to a \"lower\" one, we guarantee no cycles. But we don't know the topological order yet.\n\nConsider the \"demand\" for each vertex. For an intermediate vertex `v`, its demand is 0. For `1`, it's `+F`. For `n`, it's `-F`.\nLet `deficit[v]` be the sum of flow on edges incident to `v` that *must* be incoming to `v` to satisfy its balance.\nLet `surplus[v]` be the sum of flow on edges incident to `v` that *must* be outgoing from `v` to satisfy its balance.\n\nThis problem is a classic application of a specific type of DFS or a \"potential\" based approach.\nLet's define `flow_balance[v]` for each vertex `v`. This will be the net flow *out* of `v` that we have currently accounted for.\nInitialize `flow_balance[v] = 0` for all `v`.\nWe will use a DFS. When we visit a vertex `u`, we need to determine directions for its *undirected* neighbors.\nThe key insight here is that we can decide the direction of an edge `(u, v)` based on the \"needs\" of `u` and `v`.\nSince we want no cycles, we should avoid directing an edge `v -> u` if `u` has already been \"processed\" and `v` is being processed later. This suggests a specific traversal order.\n\nLet's use a standard DFS.\n`visited` array to track visited nodes.\n`current_flow_balance[v]` for each node `v` (initially 0).\n`adj` list: `adj[u]` stores `(v, flow_id, flow_amount)` for edges `(u, v)`.\n`result[flow_id]` stores 0 (u -> v) or 1 (v -> u).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2 * 10**5 + 500) # Increase recursion limit for deep DFS\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    edges_input = []\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        u, v, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges_input.append((u, v, c))\n        adj[u].append((v, c, i)) # Store (neighbor, capacity, original_edge_index)\n        adj[v].append((u, c, i)) # Undirected graph\n\n    # current_flow_balance[v] will store sum(incoming_flow) - sum(outgoing_flow)\n    # for edges whose direction has been decided.\n    # We want this to be 0 for 1 < v < n.\n    # For v=1, it must be negative (net outgoing).\n    # For v=n, it must be positive (net incoming).\n    current_flow_balance = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # result[edge_index] stores 0 if original_u -> original_v, 1 if original_v -> original_u\n    result = [-1] * m\n\n    # visited[v] = True if v has been visited by DFS\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n\n    # DFS function to determine edge directions\n    # u: current vertex\n    # parent: parent of u in DFS tree (to avoid going back immediately)\n    def dfs(u, parent):\n        visited[u] = True\n        \n        # Iterate over all neighbors of u\n        for v, capacity, edge_idx in adj[u]:\n            # If this edge direction has already been decided (from v's DFS call), skip\n            if result[edge_idx] != -1:\n                continue\n\n            # If v is the parent in DFS tree, we don't process it here.\n            # This edge will be processed when returning from v's DFS call.\n            # This is crucial for correctly accumulating flow balance.\n            if v == parent:\n                continue\n\n            # Recursively call DFS for unvisited neighbors\n            if not visited[v]:\n                # Before calling DFS for v, we tentatively assume u -> v.\n                # This is just a conceptual direction for the DFS traversal.\n                # The actual flow direction will be decided after v's subtree is processed.\n                \n                # Perform DFS on v.
