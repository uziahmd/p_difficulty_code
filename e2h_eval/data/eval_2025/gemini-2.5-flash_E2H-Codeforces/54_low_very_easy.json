Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Angle Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Mister B and Angle in Polygon\" problem. My understanding is that we're given a regular n-gon and need to pick three vertices to form an angle that's as close as possible to a target angle 'a'.  The key is recognizing the geometric properties here.  Since it's a regular polygon, all vertices lie on a circumcircle.  Angles formed within that circle are inscribed angles, and there's a neat relationship between inscribed angles and central angles.\n\nInitially, I thought about fixing one vertex and varying the others, like making vertex 2 the central point and 1 and some other point the side points.  I can shift things around later. That angle is directly proportional to the arc it subtends.  The central angle, the one at the center of the circumcircle, is easy to calculate because it's based on how many \"sides\" the arc covers. Each segment contributes 360/n degrees. The inscribed angle is simply half of that central angle.\n\nNow, I think I can generalize this. If I pick vertices v1, v2, and v3, the angle v1-v2-v3 is determined by the number of vertices on the arc subtended by v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2. That's the essence of it, right? I need to use the fact that the inscribed angle is half of the central angle subtended by the arc connecting the other two vertices. My plan is to figure out a formula that maps the difference in vertex numbers to an angle, and then I can iterate and find the closest match to the target angle 'a'.  That's the core of how to solve this, I'm sure of it.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`.\n\nIn a regular `n`-gon, all vertices lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` (an inscribed angle) subtends an arc `v1-v3`. The measure of this inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.\n\nLet's fix `v2` to be vertex `2` (we can always rotate the polygon so that one of the angle's sides starts from vertex `1` and goes to vertex `2`).\nLet `v1` be vertex `1`.\nNow we need to choose `v3` from the remaining vertices `3, 4, ..., n`.\n\nIf `v2` is vertex `2`, `v1` is vertex `1`, and `v3` is vertex `k` (where `k` is from `3` to `n`), the angle `1-2-k` subtends the arc `1-k`.\nThe number of edges on the perimeter between vertex `1` and vertex `k` (not passing through vertex `2`) is `k-1`.\nEach edge of a regular `n`-gon subtends a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\nSo, the central angle for the arc `1-k` is `(k-1) * (360/n)`.\nThe inscribed angle `1-2-k` is half of this central angle:\n`Angle = (1/2) * (k-1) * (360/n) = (k-1) * (180/n)`.\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` (where `3 <= k <= n`) such that `(k-1) * (180/n)` is as close as possible to `a`.\nLet `m = k-1`. Then `m` can range from `2` to `n-1`.\nThe possible angles are `m * (180/n)` for `m = 2, 3, ..., n-1`.\nThe smallest possible angle is `2 * (180/n)` (formed by `v1, v2, v4` for example, or `1, 2, 3` in a triangle, `1, 2, 4` in a square), and the largest is `(n-1) * (180/n)`. Note that `(n-1) * (180/n)` is the internal angle of the polygon, which is `180 - 360/n`.\n\nWe are looking for an `m` (from `2` to `n-1`) that minimizes `|m * (180/n) - a|`.\n\nWe can iterate through all possible values of `m` from `2` to `n-1`, calculate the angle, and keep track of the `m` that yields the minimum absolute difference.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `min_diff` to a very large value (e.g., infinity).\n2.  Initialize `best_m` to `2`.\n3.  Iterate `m` from `2` to `n-1`:\n    a.  Calculate the current angle: `current_angle = m * (180 / n)`.\n    b.  Calculate the absolute difference: `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    c.  If `diff < min_diff`:\n        i.  Update `min_diff = diff`.\n        ii. Update `best_m = m`.\n4.  Once the loop finishes, `best_m` will hold the `m` that produces the angle closest to `a`.\n5.  The vertices are: `v1 = 1`, `v2 = 2`, `v3 = best_m + 1`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n`n = 4, a = 67`\n`180/n = 180/4 = 45`\n\n*   `m = 2`: `current_angle = 2 * 45 = 90`. `diff = |90 - 67| = 23`. `min_diff = 23`, `best_m = 2`.\n*   `m = 3`: `current_angle = 3 * 45 = 135`. `diff = |135 - 67| = 68`. `diff` is not less than `min_diff`.\n\nLoop ends. `best_m = 2`.\nVertices are `v1=1`, `v2=2`, `v3=best_m+1 = 2+1 = 3`.\nOutput: `1 2 3`.\nWait, the example output for `4 67` is `2 1 3`. Let's recheck my formula.\n\nThe vertices are `v1, v2, v3`. `v2` is the vertex of the angle.\nThe angle `v1-v2-v3` subtends the arc `v1-v3`.\nThe number of edges between `v1` and `v3` (on the arc not containing `v2`) determines the angle.\nLet's fix `v2` to be vertex `1`.\nThen `v1` can be vertex `2`.\nAnd `v3` can be any vertex `k` from `3` to `n`.\nThe angle `2-1-k` subtends the arc `2-k`.\nThe number of edges in this arc is `k-2`.\nSo the angle is `(k-2) * (180/n)`.\nLet `m = k-2`. Then `m` can range from `1` to `n-2`.\n\n**Revised Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize `min_diff` to a very large value.\n2.  Initialize `best_m` to `1`.\n3.  Iterate `m` from `1` to `n-2`:\n    a.  Calculate the current angle: `current_angle = m * (180 / n)`.\n    b.  Calculate the absolute difference: `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    c.  If `diff < min_diff`:\n        i.  Update `min_diff = diff`.\n        ii. Update `best_m = m`.\n4.  The vertices are: `v1 = 2`, `v2 = 1`, `v3 = best_m + 2`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (Revised):**\n`n = 4, a = 67`\n`180/n = 180/4 = 45`\n\n*   `m = 1`: `current_angle = 1 * 45 = 45`. `diff = |45 - 67| = 22`. `min_diff = 22`, `best_m = 1`.\n*   `m = 2`: `current_angle = 2 * 45 = 90`. `diff = |90 - 67| = 23`. `diff` is not less than `min_diff`.\n\nLoop ends. `best_m = 1`.\nVertices are `v1=2`, `v2=1`, `v3=best_m+2 = 1+2 = 3`.\nOutput: `2 1 3`. This matches the example!\n\nThis approach correctly identifies the possible angles and finds the best one.\nThe complexity will be O(N) because of the loop from `1` to `n-2`. Given `n <= 10^5`, this is efficient enough.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_m = -1 # best_m represents the number of edges in the arc subtended by the angle\n\n    # The vertex of the angle is fixed at 1.\n    # One side of the angle goes from 1 to 2.
