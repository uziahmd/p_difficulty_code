Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**X-Shaped Grid Verification**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to determine if a given square grid of characters represents an \"X\" shape.  This sounds straightforward enough. The input will be an `n x n` grid, where `n` is an odd number. Let's think through the specific requirements.\n\nFirst, the diagonals.  All the characters along *both* diagonals must be identical. That's the core \"X\" component.  Secondly, all the remaining characters (those *not* on a diagonal) must be the same, but *different* from the diagonal characters. So, there's a distinction between the diagonals and the rest of the grid.  Got it.\n\nThe grid itself will be represented as `paper[row][col]`.  Rows and columns are zero-indexed, from `0` up to `n-1`.\n\nNow, how do I actually *check* this?  Well, first, I'll read in `n` from the input.  Then, I'll read the grid itself, probably storing it as a list of strings or maybe a list of lists of characters. Either works.\n\nTo identify the diagonals, the conditions are simple:  the main diagonal is where `row == col`, and the anti-diagonal is where `row + col == n - 1`. Easy.\n\nThe algorithm itself is starting to form in my mind.  I need to grab the diagonal character (`diag_char`).  I can just grab the character at `paper[0][0]`, that's safe.  Then, I'll initialize a flag, `is_x`, to `True`. This is my assumption, which I'll test later.\n\nNext, I need to figure out what the *non-diagonal* character (`non_diag_char`) is. Rather than iterating through and scanning the grid, let's just make sure it exists. Since `n` is odd and greater than 1, `paper[0][1]` is guaranteed to be a non-diagonal cell. Cool! This approach is more efficient.\n\nA crucial check: are `diag_char` and `non_diag_char` different? If they're the same, it's immediately not an \"X,\" so I'll print \"NO\" and exit.  No point wasting time.\n\nNow for the core check. I'll iterate through every cell in the grid using nested loops. For each cell `paper[r][c]`, I'll check if it's on a diagonal. If it *is* on a diagonal, I'll verify if it's equal to `diag_char`. If not, `is_x` goes to `False`, and I'll break out of the loops, no need to keep checking.\n\nIf the cell is *not* on a diagonal, I'll check if it's equal to `non_diag_char`.  Same logic, if it's not, set `is_x` to `False` and break.\n\nFinally, after iterating through everything, if `is_x` is still `True`, it *is* an X shape, so I'll print \"YES.\" Otherwise, it's not, and I'll print \"NO.\"\n\nThat looks complete and concise. Let's implement it! The example provided should be useful for validation.\n",
