            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The core is figuring out the minimum *number* of additional tiles needed to make a \"mentsu\" from an initial hand of three tiles. \"Mentsu\" can be either a koutsu (three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (three consecutive tiles of the same suit).\n\nThe input is simple: three tile strings (e.g., \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\"). The output is the minimum number of draws (0, 1, or 2). We're essentially trying to minimize the *draws*, meaning we're looking at scenarios: can we complete a mentsu with zero extra tiles (the initial hand is already a mentsu?), with one extra tile, or do we always need two. Two draws will always work since we can make a koutsu.\n\nA tile can be represented as a tuple or an integer (number and suit), let's say (num, suit). I can parse that. To make life easier, I'll sort the tiles after parsing them, by suit then number.\n\n**Initial Checks (Zero Draws):**\n\nFirst, I'll check if the initial hand *already* forms a mentsu.\n\n*   **Koutsu Check:** Are all three tiles identical?\n*   **Shuntsu Check:** Are they the same suit AND sequential? I'll sort the numbers for the shuntsu check to make sure they are in order.\n\nIf either condition is true, boom, the answer is 0.\n\n**One Draw Analysis**\n\nIf zero draws don't work, I'll check if one extra tile is enough. This means figuring out if, by adding *any* single tile to our hand, we can make a mentsu using *some* combination of four tiles. A simple strategy is to iterate through all *pairs* of initial tiles, look at what single tile would complete a mentsu for that pair.\n\n*   **Koutsu with 1 draw:** If any two tiles are the same, drawing that same tile creates a koutsu.\n*   **Shuntsu with 1 draw:** if two tiles have the same suit, look at their number and see if one extra tile could result in sequential sequence. Like having a '1' and '3' of the same suit, the '2' would complete a shuntso. If the pair forms a gap, we know we can draw the missing tile to form a shuntsu. We can have a gap between two tiles, but the numbers must only be different by at most two and have same suit to consider for shuntso.\n\nIf any pair can form a mentsu with a draw, the answer is 1.\n\n**Two Draw Guarantee**\n\nIf neither zero nor one draw does the trick, the answer *must* be 2. Why? Two draws *always* gets a mentsu because we can always form a koutsu by drawing two copies of any tile we've got.\n\n**Algorithmic Outline**\n\n1.  **Parse Input:** Read the three tile strings and convert to a list of (number, suit) tuples.\n2.  **Sort:** Sort the tile tuples by (suit, number).\n3.  **Zero Draws Check:** Check for koutsu and shuntsu in the initial hand, and exit if so (0).\n4.  **One Draw Check:**\n    *   Iterate through all pairs of distinct initial tiles.\n    *   For each pair:\n        *   Check for a Koutsu; If any two initial tiles are identical: return 1.\n        *   Check for a Shuntsu, draw one tile to create a shuntsu.\n    *   If any combination allows for a single draw mentsu, exit (1).\n5.  **Two Draws:** Return 2. This is the fallback if neither 0 nor 1 draw works.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be either a koutsu (triplet of three identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three consecutive tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles and can draw any tile she wants, an infinite number of times.\n\nWe need to determine if 0, 1, or 2 draws are needed. The maximum possible answer is 2, because even in the worst case, she can always pick one of her existing tiles and draw two more identical copies of it to form a koutsu.\n\nLet the initial three tiles be `t1, t2, t3`. Each tile is represented by a number (1-9) and a suit (m, p, s).\n\n**1. Check for 0 Draws:**\nTo form a mentsu with 0 draws, the initial three tiles `t1, t2, t3` must already form a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n*   **Koutsu Check**: All three tiles are identical (`t1 == t2` and `t2 == t3`).\n*   **Shuntsu Check**: All three tiles are of the same suit AND their numbers are consecutive (e.g., `1m, 2m, 3m` or `5s, 6s, 7s`). To check this, we extract the numbers, sort them, and then verify if `num[1] == num[0] + 1` and `num[2] == num[1] + 1`.\n\nIf either of these conditions is met, the answer is 0.\n\n**2. Check for 1 Draw:**\nIf 0 draws are not sufficient, we check if 1 draw can form a mentsu. With one draw, we will have four tiles in total. A mentsu can be formed by combining the drawn tile with any two of the original three tiles. This means we need to find if any pair of tiles from the initial hand can form a mentsu with one additional tile.\n\nLet's consider all unique pairs of tiles from the initial hand: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, and `(t2, t3)`. For each pair `(t_a, t_b)`:\n\n*   **Koutsu Possibility**: If `t_a` and `t_b` are identical (`t_a == t_b`), we can draw another `t_a` (or `t_b`) to form a koutsu `[t_a, t_a, t_a]`.\n*   **Shuntsu Possibility**: If `t_a` and `t_b` are of the same suit:\n    *   Let their numbers be `n_a` and `n_b`.\n    *   If `abs(n_a - n_b) == 1` (e.g., `2m, 3m`): We can draw `n_a - 1` (if `n_a > 1`) or `n_b + 1` (if `n_b < 9`) to form a shuntsu. At least one of these is always possible. For example, with `2m, 3m`, we can draw `1m` to form `[1m, 2m, 3m]` or `4m` to form `[2m, 3m, 4m]`.\n    *   If `abs(n_a - n_b) == 2` (e.g., `2m, 4m`): We can draw `n_a + 1` (which is `n_b - 1`) to form a shuntsu `[n_a, n_a+1, n_b]`. For example, with `2m, 4m`, we can draw `3m` to form `[2m, 3m, 4m]`.\n\nIf any of these conditions are met for any pair, the answer is 1.\n\n**3. Check for 2 Draws:**\nIf neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, then the answer must be 2. As explained earlier, we can always form a koutsu by drawing two tiles identical to any one of the existing tiles.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n1.  Parse the input strings into a more usable format, e.g., a list of `(number, suit)` tuples.\n2.  Sort the list of tiles. This helps in consistently checking shuntsu conditions, especially for the 0-draw case where tiles might be given out of order (e.g., `5s 7s 6s`). Sorting by suit then by number is a good strategy.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (3p 9m 2p):**\n1.  **Parse and Sort**: `['3p', '9m', '2p']` becomes `[(9, 'm'), (2, 'p'), (3, 'p')]` (assuming 'm' comes before 'p' in lexicographical sort).\n2.  **0 Draws?**\n    *   Koutsu: `(9,'m') == (2,'p')` is false. Not a koutsu.\n    *   Shuntsu: Suits are not all the same ('m' vs 'p'). Not a shuntsu.\n3.  **1 Draw?**\n    *   `can_one_draw = False`\n    *   Check for koutsu with 1 draw (any two tiles identical):\n        *   `(9,'m') == (2,'p')` is false.\n        *   `(2,'p') == (3,'p')` is false.\n        *   `(9,'m') == (3,'p')` is false.\n        *   `can_one_draw` remains `False`.\n    *   Check for shuntsu with 1 draw (any two tiles form a sequence with one draw):\n        *   Pair `((9,'m'), (2,'p'))`: Different suits. Cannot form shuntsu.\n        *   Pair `((9,'m'), (3,'p'))`: Different suits. Cannot form shuntsu.\n        *   Pair `((2,'p'), (3,'p'))`: Same suit ('p'). Numbers are `2, 3`. `abs(2-3) == 1`. This means we can draw `1p` (to make `[1p, 2p, 3p]`) or `4p` (to make `[2p, 3p, 4p]`). So, 1 draw is sufficient.\n        *   `can_one_draw` becomes `True`.\n    *   Since `can_one_draw` is `True`, print `1`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    tiles = []\n    for tile_str in s:\n        num = int(tile_str[0])\n        suit = tile_str[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n\n    # Sort tiles for consistent processing.\n    # Sort by suit, then by number.\n    tiles.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\n    # --- Check 0 draws ---\n    # Koutsu (Triplet) check: All three tiles are identical.\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] and tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Shuntsu (Sequence) check: All same suit AND consecutive numbers.\n    if tiles[0][1] == tiles[1][1] and tiles[1][1] == tiles[2][1]: # Same suit\n        nums = [tiles[0][0], tiles[1][0], tiles[2][0]]\n        # Tiles are already sorted by number within the same suit due to overall sort.\n        if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1: # Consecutive numbers\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # --- Check 1 draw ---\n    # We need to find if any two tiles from the current hand, plus one drawn tile, can form a mentsu.\n    # There are three pairs of tiles: (tiles[0], tiles[1]), (tiles[0], tiles[2]), (tiles[1], tiles[2]).\n    \n    can_one_draw = False\n\n    # Check for Koutsu with 1 draw: If any two tiles are identical, draw a third.\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] or tiles[1] == tiles[2] or tiles[0] == tiles[2]:\n        can_one_draw = True\n\n    # Check for Shuntsu with 1 draw:\n    # Helper function to check if two tiles can form a shuntsu with one draw.\n    def check_shuntsu_with_one_draw(t1, t2):\n        if t1[1] != t2[1]:  # Different suits, cannot form shuntsu\n            return False\n        \n        n1, n2 = sorted([t1[0], t2[0]]) # Get sorted numbers\n        \n        # Case 1: n1 and n2 are consecutive (e.g., 2, 3).
