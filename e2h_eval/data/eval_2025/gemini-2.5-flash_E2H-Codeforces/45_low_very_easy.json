There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Tennis Championship\" problem and my immediate thought is to build a Python script to solve it. I've got the setup: a knockout tournament with *n* players, and the rather specific rule about game differences. I need to maximize the games played by the winner.\n\nFirst, I break it down. Let's call the number of games a player's won *k*.  The core constraint is that a match can only happen if the absolute difference in *k* values between two players is at most 1.  I need to figure out how to maximize the winner's *k*. Let's call the winner W, and they'll start at 0 games.\n\nMy initial thought is to have W play a bunch of players who also have zero games. But the constraint bites me pretty quickly.  W with 0 games can only play someone with 0 or 1. W can win twice, giving a k of 2 and if there is more than 3 players. W with 2 games can't play anyone with 0, which means this approach has an immediate limitation. For a small `n` it might work, but it's clearly not optimal for larger values.\n\nSo, I pivot. I think about how to *efficiently* increase W's game count. The best strategy seems to be finding opponents with similar game counts.  Specifically, it seems optimal for W to play someone with either *k-1*, *k*, or *k+1* games. The most efficient increase seems to be playing someone with *k-1* games. That means W is always playing someone who's also been advancing.\n\nThis leads me to think about a recursive pattern, something where I can relate the minimum number of players needed to achieve a winning player with a certain number of games.  I'm going to start formulating this relationship, maybe with a function `f(k)` where *f(k)* is the *minimum* number of players for the winner to have played k games.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule for pairing players: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other has already played. Both players must have won all their previous games to continue.\n\nLet's denote the number of games a player has won so far as `k`. If player A has won `k_A` games and player B has won `k_B` games, they can play if `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1`.\n\nWe want to maximize the games for the winner. Let's assume player W is the winner. To maximize W's games, W should always play against an opponent who has played as many games as possible, while still adhering to the rule. This means W (who has played `k` games) should ideally play against an opponent who has played `k-1` games. This ensures that the tournament structure allows other players to also advance and accumulate games.\n\nConsider the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\nLet `N(k)` be the minimum number of players needed for a winner to play `k` games.\n*   **`k=0`**: 1 player (no games played yet). So, `N(0) = 1`.\n*   **`k=1`**: The winner (0 games) plays against another player (0 games). Total 2 players. `N(1) = 2`.\n*   **`k=2`**: The winner (1 game) needs to play against an opponent (0 or 1 game). To maximize the total games and use players efficiently, the opponent should have played 1 game. So, the winner of `k=1` (1 game) plays against another winner of `k=1` (1 game). Each `k=1` winner needs `N(1)` players. So, `N(2) = N(1) + N(1) = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n*   **`k=3`**: The winner (2 games) needs to play against an opponent (1 or 2 games). To maximize `k` for the winner, the opponent should have played 2 games. So, `N(3) = N(2) + N(2) = 4 + 4 = 8`.\n\nThis pattern suggests `N(k) = 2^k`. This is the standard number of players for a balanced knockout tournament where all players play roughly the same number of games until they meet. In such a tournament, the winner plays `log2(N)` games. This is possible if `N` is a power of 2.\n\nHowever, the rule `abs(k_A - k_B) <= 1` allows for more flexibility.\nTo maximize the winner's games, W (who has played `k` games) should play against an opponent who has played `k-1` games.\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played `k` games.\n*   `f(0) = 1` (1 player, 0 games played)\n*   `f(1)`: W (0 games) plays P1 (0 games). W wins. W has 1 game. Total 2 players. `f(1) = 2`.\n*   `f(2)`: W (1 game) plays P1 (0 games). W wins. W has 2 games. This requires 3 players (W, P1, P2). `f(2) = 3`.\n    *   Example: W beats P1. W has 1 game. W beats P2. W has 2 games. P2 must have 0 or 1 game. If P2 has 0 games, this is valid. Total players: W, P1, P2.\n*   `f(3)`: W (2 games) plays P1 (1 game). W wins. W has 3 games.\n    *   To get W to 2 games, we need `f(2)=3` players.\n    *   To get P1 to 1 game, we need `f(1)=2` players.\n    *   Total players `f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n*   `f(4)`: W (3 games) plays P1 (2 games). W wins. W has 4 games.\n    *   Total players `f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`.\n*   `f(5)`: W (4 games) plays P1 (3 games). W wins. W has 5 games.\n    *   Total players `f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 8 + 5 = 13`.\n\nThis sequence `f(k)` (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...) is the Fibonacci sequence, where `f(k) = F_{k+2}` (using the common definition `F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, ...`).\nSo, `F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8, F_7=13, ...`\nOur `f(k)` values are:\n`f(0)=1` (which is `F_2`)\n`f(1)=2` (which is `F_3`)\n`f(2)=3` (which is `F_4`)\n`f(k) = F_{k+2}`\n\nWe are given `n` players and want to find the maximum `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\nWe need to find the largest `k` such that `F_{k+2} <= n`.\n\nGiven `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers until they exceed `n`.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n1.  Initialize `a = 1` (representing `F_2`, which is `f(0)`) and `b = 2` (representing `F_3`, which is `f(1)`).\n2.  Initialize `k = 1` (because `b` allows for `k=1` games).\n3.  While `b <= n`:\n    *   Update `a` and `b`: `a, b = b, a + b`.\n    *   Increment `k`: `k = k + 1`.\n4.  The loop terminates when `b > n`. At this point, `a` holds `F_{k+1}` (which is `f(k-1)`) and `b` holds `F_{k+2}` (which is `f(k)`). Since `b > n`, the maximum number of games possible is `k-1`.\n\nLet's trace with examples:\n*   `n = 2`:\n    *   `a=1, b=2, k=1`\n    *   `b (2) <= n (2)` is true.\n    *   `a, b = 2, 1+2 = 3`. `a=2, b=3`.\n    *   `k = 1+1 = 2`.\n    *   Now `b (3) <= n (2)` is false. Loop terminates.\n    *   Result: `k-1 = 2-1 = 1`. Correct.\n\n*   `n = 3`:\n    *   `a=1, b=2, k=1`\n    *   `b (2) <= n (3)` is true.\n    *   `a, b = 2, 3`. `k=2`.\n    *   `b (3) <= n (3)` is true.\n    *   `a, b = 3, 2+3 = 5`. `a=3, b=5`.\n    *   `k = 2+1 = 3`.\n    *   Now `b (5) <= n (3)` is false. Loop terminates.\n    *   Result: `k-1 = 3-1 = 2`. Correct.\n\n*   `n = 4`:\n    *   `a=1, b=2, k=1`\n    *   `b (2) <= n (4)` is true.\n    *   `a, b = 2, 3`. `k=2`.\n    *   `b (3) <= n (4)` is true.\n    *   `a, b = 3, 5`. `k=3`.\n    *   Now `b (5) <= n (4)` is false. Loop terminates.\n    *   Result: `k-1 = 3-1 = 2`. Correct.\n\n*   `n = 10`:\n    *   `a=1, b=2, k=1`\n    *   `b (2) <= n (10)`: `a=2, b=3, k=2`\n    *   `b (3) <= n (10)`: `a=3, b=5, k=3`\n    *   `b (5) <= n (10)`: `a=5, b=8, k=4`\n    *   `b (8) <= n (10)`: `a=8, b=13, k=5`\n    *   Now `b (13) <= n (10)` is false. Loop terminates.\n    *   Result: `k-1 = 5-1 = 4`. Correct.\n\nThe largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `10^18` is `F_90 = 2880067194370816120`.\n`F_89 = 1779979416004714197`.\nSo, `f(88) = F_{88+2} = F_{90} > 10^{18}`.\n`f(87) = F_{87+2} = F_{89} <= 10^{18}`.\nThe maximum `k` would be 87. This means the loop will run about 88 times, which is very efficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # a and b will store consecutive Fibonacci numbers F_i and F_{i+1}\n    # We are looking for the largest k such that f(k) <= n\n    # where f(k) = F_{k+2}\n    # Initial values:\n    # k=0: f(0) = F_2 = 1.\n    # k=1: f(1) = F_3 = 2.\n    # We start with a = F_2 = 1 (representing f(0))\n    # and b = F_3 = 2 (representing f(1))\n    # The variable 'games' tracks the current maximum games possible with 'b' players.\n    \n    a = 1  # Corresponds to F_2 = f(0)\n    b = 2  # Corresponds to F_3 = f(1)\n    games = 1 # The winner can play 1 game with 'b' (2) players\n\n    while b <= n:\n        # If we have 'b' players, the winner can play 'games' games.\n        # To play 'games + 1' games, the winner (who played 'games' games)\n        # needs to beat an opponent who played 'games - 1' games.\n        # This requires f(games) + f(games-1) players.\n        # In terms of Fibonacci: F_{games+2} + F_{games+1} = F_{games+3}\n        # So, the next 'b' becomes a+b, and 'a' becomes the old 'b'.\n        \n        a, b = b, a + b\n        games += 1\n    \n    # The loop terminates when b > n.\n    # At this point, 'b' represents f(games), which is F_{games+2}.\n    # Since f(games) > n, we cannot achieve 'games' games for the winner.\n    # The maximum number of games is 'games - 1'.\n    print(games - 1)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
