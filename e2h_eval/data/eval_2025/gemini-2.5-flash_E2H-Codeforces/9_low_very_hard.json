Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**My Reasoning for Solving the \"Selling Souvenirs\" Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Selling Souvenirs\" problem that looks suspiciously like a knapsack variation. Let's break this down. The setup is pretty clear: I need to maximize the cost of souvenirs I can carry, given a weight limit.  I've got `n` souvenirs, each with a weight `w_i` and cost `c_i`, and a maximum weight `m`.  Standard knapsack looks like an obvious starting point, with `dp[w]` representing the maximum cost for a weight `w`.  But, a direct O(n*m) dynamic programming approach is immediately out.  `n` and `m` are too large. We're talking 10^5 times 3*10^5, that's way too many operations.\n\nThe key here, the one thing that screams optimization, is the very small weight constraint: `w_i` is only 1, 2, or 3. That's a huge hint.\n\nStandard DP is out, so let's use the weights. I think the weights themselves are the key! I should group the souvenirs by weight. I can create lists: `costs_w1`, `costs_w2`, and `costs_w3`, storing the costs for each weight and sort each in descending order, because I want to pick the most expensive items first.\n\nThen the problem becomes how many items do I pick from each weight group? Let's say I choose `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` items from each respective list, where the total weight constraint is `k1 + 2k2 + 3k3 <= m`. The cost becomes the sum of the best `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` items from the corresponding lists. Brute-forcing all the values of `k1`, `k2`, `k3` from 0 to `n` is, obviously, too slow.\n\nOkay, let's try a different strategy. I need to iterate less. If I keep one variable fixed, that might work. Given that the highest number is the \"3\" items, let me iterate on the number of weight-3 items, `k3`. The maximum `k3` can only be `m/3`, which is still pretty big, at around 10^5, but much less than n*m. Let me start there and see where it goes.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to select a subset of souvenirs with weights `wi` (1, 2, or 3) and costs `ci` to maximize total cost, subject to a total weight limit `m`. The number of souvenirs `n` can be up to 100,000 and `m` up to 300,000.\n\nA standard knapsack DP approach (O(n*m)) would be too slow due to the large `n` and `m`. However, the small range of weights (1, 2, 3) is a crucial hint.\n\nWe can categorize souvenirs by their weights. Let's store the costs of souvenirs with weight 1, 2, and 3 in separate lists: `w1_costs`, `w2_costs`, and `w3_costs`. To maximize cost, we should always pick the most expensive souvenirs first for any given weight category. So, we sort these lists in descending order.\n\nLet `k1`, `k2`, `k3` be the number of souvenirs chosen from `w1_costs`, `w2_costs`, and `w3_costs` respectively.\nThe total weight will be `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 + k3 * 3 <= m`.\nThe total cost will be `sum(w1_costs[:k1]) + sum(w2_costs[:k2]) + sum(w3_costs[:k3])`.\n\nWe can iterate through all possible numbers of items of weight 3 (`k3`).\nThe maximum `k3` can be `m / 3`. So, `k3` can range from `0` to `m / 3` (approx 100,000).\nFor each `k3`:\n1.  Calculate the weight used by `k3` items: `current_w3_weight = k3 * 3`.\n2.  Calculate the cost from `k3` items: `current_w3_cost = sum(w3_costs[:k3])`.\n3.  Calculate the remaining weight capacity: `remaining_m = m - current_w3_weight`. If `remaining_m < 0`, this `k3` is invalid.\n4.  Now we need to fill `remaining_m` using items of weight 1 and 2. This is a subproblem.\n\nThis subproblem can be solved efficiently. We have items of weight 1 and 2.\nLet `dp[w]` be the maximum cost achievable for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\nWe can compute this `dp` array.\n`dp[0] = 0`, `dp[j] = -infinity` for `j > 0`.\nIterate `j` from `1` to `remaining_m`:\n  `dp[j] = dp[j-1] + (w1_costs[k1_idx] if k1_idx < len(w1_costs) else -infinity)` (if we add a weight 1 item)\n  `dp[j] = dp[j-2] + (w2_costs[k2_idx] if k2_idx < len(w2_costs) else -infinity)` (if we add a weight 2 item)\nThis is still too complex if `k1_idx` and `k2_idx` are not tracked correctly.\n\nA better approach for the subproblem:\nWe have `w1_costs` and `w2_costs` (both sorted descending).\nWe want to pick `k1` items from `w1_costs` and `k2` items from `w2_costs` such that `k1 * 1 + k2 * 2 <= remaining_m` and `sum(w1_costs[:k1]) + sum(w2_costs[:k2])` is maximized.\n\nWe can iterate on the number of items of weight 2 (`k2`) from `0` to `remaining_m / 2`.\nFor each `k2`:\n1.  Weight used by `k2` items: `k2 * 2`.\n2.  Cost from `k2` items: `current_w2_cost = sum(w2_costs[:k2])`.\n3.  Remaining weight for weight 1 items: `remaining_m_for_w1 = remaining_m - k2 * 2`.\n4.  Number of weight 1 items to pick: `k1 = min(len(w1_costs), remaining_m_for_w1)`.\n5.  Cost from `k1` items: `current_w1_cost = sum(w1_costs[:k1])`.\n6.  Total cost for this `k2` (and optimal `k1`): `current_w2_cost + current_w1_cost`.\nWe maximize this over all `k2`.\n\nThis nested iteration (`k3` loops, `k2` loops) would be `(m/3) * (m/2)`, which is `O(m^2)`, still too slow (`300000^2` is too large).\n\nThe observation is that the maximum `k2` is `m/2` (approx 150,000) and `k3` is `m/3` (approx 100,000). The total number of items `n` is 100,000. This implies that if we pick many items of weight 2 or 3, we cannot pick many items of weight 1.\n\nLet's refine the strategy:\n1.  Separate souvenirs by weight: `w1_costs`, `w2_costs`, `w3_costs`.\n2.  Sort each list in descending order.\n3.  Precompute prefix sums for each list to get `sum(list[:k])` in O(1).\n    `pref_w1[k] = sum(w1_costs[:k])`\n    `pref_w2[k] = sum(w2_costs[:k])`\n    `pref_w3[k] = sum(w3_costs[:k])`\n\nNow, iterate over `k3` (number of items of weight 3).\n`k3` goes from `0` up to `min(len(w3_costs), m // 3)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n  `current_cost = pref_w3[k3]`\n  `current_weight = k3 * 3`\n  `remaining_m = m - current_weight`\n\n  Now we need to fill `remaining_m` using `w1_costs` and `w2_costs`.\n  This subproblem can be solved using a \"two pointers\" or \"meet-in-the-middle\" like approach, or a specialized DP.\n  Let `dp_sub[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n  We can compute `dp_sub` for weights up to `remaining_m`.\n  The crucial insight for the subproblem (weights 1 and 2) is that `remaining_m` can be up to `m`.\n  We can compute `dp_sub` for all possible `k2` (number of items of weight 2).\n  For a fixed `k2` (from 0 to `min(len(w2_costs), remaining_m // 2)`):\n    `cost_from_w2 = pref_w2[k2]`\n    `weight_from_w2 = k2 * 2`\n    `remaining_m_for_w1 = remaining_m - weight_from_w2`\n    `k1 = min(len(w1_costs), remaining_m_for_w1)`\n    `cost_from_w1 = pref_w1[k1]`\n    `total_cost_for_k2 = cost_from_w2 + cost_from_w1`\n    We need to maximize `total_cost_for_k2` over all valid `k2`.\n\nThis `k2` iteration is `O(m)`. The outer `k3` iteration is `O(m)`. Total `O(m^2)`, still too slow.\n\nThe constraint `n <= 100000` is key. The total number of items is not that large.\nWhat if we iterate on `k2` (number of items of weight 2) and optimize `k1` and `k3`?\nOr iterate on `k1` and optimize `k2` and `k3`?\n\nConsider the total number of items `N_total = k1 + k2 + k3`. `N_total <= n`.\nIf we iterate `k2` from `0` to `min(len(w2_costs), m // 2)`:\n  `current_cost_w2 = pref_w2[k2]`\n  `current_weight_w2 = k2 * 2`\n  `remaining_m_prime = m - current_weight_w2`\n\nNow we need to select `k1` items of weight 1 and `k3` items of weight 3 to fill `remaining_m_prime`.\n`k1 * 1 + k3 * 3 <= remaining_m_prime`.\nThis is again a knapsack-like problem, but with weights 1 and 3.\n\nLet's use a standard DP approach for the remaining items (weights 1 and 2) but limited by `n`.\nThe number of items of weight 3 is `k3`.\nThe number of items of weight 2 is `k2`.\nThe number of items of weight 1 is `k1`.\n\nThe maximum number of items of weight 1 is `n`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 2 is `n`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 3 is `n`.\n\nLet's iterate on `k2` (number of items of weight 2).\n`k2` can go from `0` to `min(len(w2_costs), m // 2)`.\nFor each `k2`:\n  `cost_w2 = pref_w2[k2]`\n  `weight_w2 = k2 * 2`\n  `remaining_capacity = m - weight_w2`\n\nNow we need to choose `k1` items of weight 1 and `k3` items of weight 3 with total weight `k1 * 1 + k3 * 3 <= remaining_capacity`.\nThis subproblem has weights 1 and 3.\nWe can solve this by iterating `k3` from `0` to `min(len(w3_costs), remaining_capacity // 3)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n  `cost_w3 = pref_w3[k3]`\n  `weight_w3 = k3 * 3`\n  `remaining_capacity_for_w1 = remaining_capacity - weight_w3`\n  `k1 = min(len(w1_costs), remaining_capacity_for_w1)`\n  `cost_w1 = pref_w1[k1]`\n  `total_cost = cost_w2 + cost_w3 + cost_w1`\n  Update overall maximum.\n\nThis is `O((m/2) * (m/3)) = O(m^2)`, still too slow.\n\nThe crucial observation must be that the number of items of weight 2 and 3 that we can pick *simultaneously* is limited by `n`. If we pick many items of weight 2, we can't pick many of weight 3.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 2 is `n`.\nThe maximum number of items of weight 3 is `n`.\n\nLet's try to iterate on `k3` (number of items of weight 3).\n`k3` from `0` to `min(len(w3_costs), m // 3)`.\nFor each `k3`:\n  `current_cost_w3 = pref_w3[k3]`\n  `current_weight_w3 = k3 * 3`\n  `remaining_m_for_w1_w2 = m - current_weight_w3`\n  If `remaining_m_for_w1_w2 < 0`, continue.\n\n  Now we need to pick `k1` items of weight 1 and `k2` items of weight 2 for `remaining_m_for_w1_w2`.\n  This is a subproblem: maximize `pref_w1[k1] + pref_w2[k2]` such that `k1 + 2*k2 <= remaining_m_for_w1_w2`.\n  We can solve this subproblem efficiently.\n  Let `max_cost_1_2[w]` be the maximum cost for weight `w` using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n  `max_cost_1_2` can be computed by iterating `k2` from `0` to `min(len(w2_costs), m // 2)`.\n  For each `k2`:\n    `cost_w2 = pref_w2[k2]`\n    `weight_w2 = k2 * 2`\n    `remaining_w_for_w1 = w - weight_w2`\n    `k1 = min(len(w1_costs), remaining_w_for_w1)`\n    `cost_w1 = pref_w1[k1]`\n    `max_cost_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_1_2[w], cost_w2 + cost_w1)`\n  This calculation for `max_cost_1_2` would take `O(m * m)` if done for each `w`.\n\n  However, `max_cost_1_2[w]` can be computed in `O(m + len(w1_costs) + len(w2_costs))` time.\n  Initialize `max_cost_1_2 = [-1] * (m + 1)`.\n  `max_cost_1_2[0] = 0`.\n  For `k1` from `0` to `len(w1_costs)`:\n    `current_cost = pref_w1[k1]`\n    `current_weight = k1 * 1`\n    If `current_weight <= m`:\n      `max_cost_1_2[current_weight] = max(max_cost_1_2[current_weight], current_cost)`\n  For `k2` from `0` to `len(w2_costs)`:\n    `cost_w2 = pref_w2[k2]`\n    `weight_w2 = k2 * 2`\n    For `w` from `m` down to `weight_w2`:\n      If `max_cost_1_2[w - weight_w2]` is not -1:\n        `max_cost_1_2[w] = max(max_cost_1_2[w], max_cost_1_2[w - weight_w2] + cost_w2)`\n  This is still incorrect. The DP state needs to be carefully defined.\n  `dp[j]` is the maximum value for weight `j`.\n  When processing items of weight 1, `dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-1] + w1_costs[k1_idx])`.\n  When processing items of weight 2, `dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-2] + w2_costs[k2_idx])`.\n  This is the standard knapsack, which is `O(m * n_items)`.\n\nLet's consider the maximum number of items of weight 2 that we can pick. This is `m/2`.\nLet's consider the maximum number of items of weight 3 that we can pick. This is `m/3`.\n\nThe key is that `n` is `10^5`, `m` is `3*10^5`.\nIf we pick `k2` items of weight 2 and `k3` items of weight 3, the total number of items is `k2 + k3`. This can be up to `n`.\nThe total weight is `2*k2 + 3*k3`. This can be up to `m`.\n\nLet's iterate on `k2` (number of items of weight 2).\n`k2` from `0` to `min(len(w2_costs), m // 2)`.\nFor each `k2`:\n  `cost_w2 = pref_w2[k2]`\n  `weight_w2 = k2 * 2`\n  `remaining_capacity = m - weight_w2`\n  If `remaining_capacity < 0`, continue.\n\n  Now we need to pick `k1` items of weight 1 and `k3` items of weight 3.\n  `k1 * 1 + k3 * 3 <= remaining_capacity`.\n  This subproblem can be solved by iterating `k3` from `0` to `min(len(w3_costs), remaining_capacity // 3)`.\n  For each `k3`:\n    `cost_w3 = pref_w3[k3]`\n    `weight_w3 = k3 * 3`\n    `remaining_capacity_for_w1 = remaining_capacity - weight_w3`\n    `k1 = min(len(w1_costs), remaining_capacity_for_w1)`\n    `cost_w1 = pref_w1[k1]`\n    `total_cost = cost_w2 + cost_w3 + cost_w1`\n    Update `max_total_cost`.\n\nThe complexity is `O(min(len(w2_costs), m/2) * min(len(w3_costs), m/3))`.\nIn the worst case, `len(w2_costs)` and `len(w3_costs)` could be `n`.\nSo, `O(min(n, m/2) * min(n, m/3))`.\nIf `n` is small (e.g., `n=100`), this is `O(n^2)`.\nIf `n` is large (e.g., `n=100000`) and `m=300000`:\n  `min(n, m/2) = min(100000, 150000) = 100000`\n  `min(n, m/3) = min(100000, 100000) = 100000`\n  Complexity `10^5 * 10^5 = 10^{10}`, which is too slow.\n\nThe maximum number of items of weight 2 and 3 that we can *actually* pick is limited.\nIf we pick `k2` items of weight 2, and `k3` items of weight 3, the total items `k2+k3` cannot exceed `n`.\nThis means `k3 <= n - k2`.\n\nSo, the inner loop for `k3` should go up to `min(len(w3_costs), remaining_capacity // 3, n - k2)`.\nThe `n - k2` part is important.\n`k2` loop: `0` to `min(len(w2_costs), m // 2)`.\n`k3` loop: `0` to `min(len(w3_costs), (m - 2*k2) // 3, n - k2)`.\n\nLet `N2 = min(len(w2_costs), m // 2)`.\nLet `N3 = min(len(w3_costs), m // 3)`.\nThe number of iterations for `k2` is `N2`.\nFor each `k2`, the number of iterations for `k3` is `min(N3, (m - 2*k2) // 3, n - k2)`.\nThe `n - k2` term is crucial.\nThe sum of `min(N3, (m - 2*k2) // 3, n - k2)` over `k2` from `0` to `N2` is approximately `O(N2 * N3)` in the worst case if `n` is very large.\nBut if `n` is small, `n - k2` becomes the bottleneck.\nFor example, if `n = 1000`, `N2` can be up to `1000`, `N3` up to `1000`. `1000 * 1000 = 10^6`.
