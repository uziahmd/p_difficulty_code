His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Tackling this Olympiad Ranking Problem**\n\nOkay, I've got a competitive programming problem on my hands, and it's all about figuring out the best and worst-case ranks for a participant named Vasya. I'm given the total number of participants, a minimum score for Vasya, and scores from two rounds. The tricky part is that the scores are anonymous; I don't know which scores correspond to which participants. My goal is to determine Vasya's potential ranks given the constraints.\n\nThe heart of the problem lies in this anonymity. I need to treat the scores as a pool that can be matched up in any way, forming total scores for each participant.  This means I'm essentially looking for a perfect matching between the two sets of scores.  Since it's perfect matching, each score from the 'a' list must be paired with exactly one score from the 'b' list.\n\nMy key insight is that the best and worst ranks are dependent on Vasya's score relative to the other participants' scores.  Since the jury can decide the ties arbitrarily, the best rank comes from maximizing Vasya's score and minimizing the other participant's total scores to ensure the number of participants with higher scores is as low as possible. In contrast, the worst-case scenario occurs when I minimize Vasya's score and maximize the others.\n\nTo figure out these ranks, I'll need to calculate Vasya's score and compare it to the possible scores of the other participants. To get Vasya's best rank, I want to find the highest possible total score Vasya can achieve.  I'll need to pair the largest possible values from the 'a' and 'b' lists to create that. Then, I need to look at the remaining numbers and see how I can create combinations that are smaller than Vasya's score. The number of combinations strictly higher is the key to his rank.\n\nThe worst rank will use the lowest possible Vasya score. This will be the smallest `a_i` and `b_j` that meet the requirement.\nFor this rank, I'm trying to make the number of participants with scores *greater than or equal* to Vasya's score as large as possible.  This means I need to pair up the other numbers such that they are larger than Vasya's score as often as possible.\n\nEssentially, I'm looking at two optimization problems: maximizing Vasya's score for the best rank and minimizing it for the worst.  The pairing strategy is the most crucial part of this.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad, given the scores from two tours and the constraint that Vasya's total score is at least `x`. The scores are anonymous, meaning we don't know which first-tour score corresponds to which second-tour score for any participant.\n\nLet `n` be the number of participants and `x` be the minimum total score Vasya achieved. Let `a` be the list of scores from the first tour and `b` be the list of scores from the second tour.\n\n**Understanding Ranks and Tie-breaking:**\n- Participants are sorted by the sum of points in decreasing order.\n- If multiple participants have the same total points, the jury can assign places arbitrarily.\n- **Best Rank:** To achieve the best rank, Vasya wants to maximize his own score and minimize the scores of others who could potentially outrank him. If Vasya has score `S_V` and `k` other participants have scores `S_O > S_V`, his best rank is `k + 1`. If others have `S_O = S_V`, Vasya can be ranked above them.\n- **Worst Rank:** To achieve the worst rank, Vasya wants to minimize his own score (while still meeting the `x` constraint) and maximize the scores of others. If Vasya has score `S_V` and `k` other participants have scores `S_O >= S_V`, his worst rank is `k + 1`. If others have `S_O = S_V`, Vasya can be ranked below them.\n\n**Finding the Best Rank:**\nTo find Vasya's best rank, we need to minimize the number of participants who score strictly more than Vasya.\n1.  **Maximize Vasya's Score:** To give Vasya the highest possible score, he should take the largest available `a_i` and the largest available `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. Since we want to maximize his score, he should simply take the largest `a_i` (let's say `a_max`) and the largest `b_j` (let's say `b_max`). Their sum `a_max + b_max` will be Vasya's highest possible score. It is guaranteed that there exist `i, j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`, so `a_max + b_max` will certainly be at least `x` (unless `n=1`, in which case `a_max + b_max` is Vasya's only possible score). Let `S_V_best = a_max + b_max`.\n2.  **Minimize Other Participants' Scores:** After `a_max` and `b_max` are assigned to Vasya, the remaining `n-1` scores from `a` and `n-1` scores from `b` need to be paired up. To minimize the chances of others outranking Vasya, we should pair these remaining scores such that their sums are as small as possible. This is achieved by sorting one list in ascending order and the other in descending order, and pairing corresponding elements. For example, if `a'` and `b'` are the remaining scores, pair `a'_1` with `b'_{n-1}`, `a'_2` with `b'_{n-2}`, etc. This strategy minimizes the maximum sum and generally keeps sums low.\n3.  **Count Higher Scores:** We count how many of these `n-1` pairs have a sum strictly greater than `S_V_best`. Vasya's best rank will be `1 + (count of participants with S_O > S_V_best)`.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach for the best rank exists:\nVasya's best rank is always 1. Why? The problem statement guarantees that Vasya was present and got at least `x` points. This means there's *some* `a_i` and `b_j` that belong to Vasya. To achieve rank 1, Vasya just needs to be the participant with the highest score. We can always pair the largest `a_i` with the largest `b_j` and assign them to Vasya. Let `S_V = max(a) + max(b)`. This is the maximum possible score any participant can get. If Vasya gets this score, no one else can get a strictly higher score. Therefore, Vasya can always be rank 1 (due to tie-breaking rules, if others also get `S_V`, he can be chosen as rank 1).\nSo, the best rank is always 1.\n\n**Finding the Worst Rank:**\nTo find Vasya's worst rank, we need to maximize the number of participants who score greater than or equal to Vasya.\n1.  **Minimize Vasya's Score:** Vasya should take the smallest possible `a_i` and `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. To achieve this, we sort `a` in ascending order and `b` in ascending order. We want to find a pairing `(a_i, b_j)` for Vasya such that `a_i + b_j >= x` and `a_i + b_j` is minimized. This is tricky because `a_i` and `b_j` are then removed, affecting other pairings.\n2.  **Maximize Other Participants' Scores:** For the remaining `n-1` participants, we should pair their scores such that their sums are maximized. This is achieved by pairing the largest remaining `a` with the largest remaining `b`, the second largest `a` with the second largest `b`, and so on.\n\nA more effective strategy for the worst rank:\nWe iterate through all possible scores Vasya could have achieved. For each `a_i` from the first tour, we can try to pair it with a `b_j` from the second tour such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. To minimize Vasya's total score, we should pick the smallest `b_j` that satisfies `b_j >= x - a_i`.\nLet's fix a potential score `S_V` for Vasya. This `S_V` must be achievable by some `a_i + b_j` where `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nTo maximize the number of people who score `S_O >= S_V`, we should pair the remaining `n-1` `a` scores and `n-1` `b` scores to create as many high sums as possible. This is achieved by sorting both `a` and `b` in descending order and pairing `a_1` with `b_1`, `a_2` with `b_2`, etc.\n\nThe problem can be rephrased: for each participant, we need to assign an `a_i` and a `b_j` uniquely.\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\nLet's sort `b` in descending order: `b_1 >= b_2 >= ... >= b_n`.\n\nConsider a specific `a_i` from the sorted `a` list. What's the best `b_j` it can be paired with to satisfy `a_i + b_j >= x`?\nTo maximize the number of participants with scores `>= S_V`, we want to find a pairing that generates as many high scores as possible.\nConsider the `n` pairs `(a_i, b_{n-i+1})` after sorting `a` ascending and `b` ascending. This pairing strategy `(a_i, b_i)` (both sorted ascending) or `(a_i, b_{n-i+1})` (one ascending, one descending) generates `n` possible total scores.\n\nThe key is that Vasya is *one* of the participants. We don't know which `a_i` and `b_j` are his.\nTo find the worst rank, we want to maximize the number of participants who score greater than or equal to Vasya.\nThis means we want to find a pairing of all `a_i` and `b_j` such that:\n1.  Vasya's score `S_V` is as low as possible (but still `S_V >= x`).\n2.  The maximum number of other participants get scores `S_O >= S_V`.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order: `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\nLet's sort `b` in ascending order: `b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n`.\nConsider a specific `a_i`. We want to pair it with some `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nTo minimize `a_i + b_j` for a fixed `a_i`, we should pick the smallest `b_j` such that `b_j >= x - a_i`.\nThis suggests a two-pointer approach or binary search.\n\nLet's sort `a` in ascending order.\nLet's sort `b` in descending order.\nConsider the pairs `(a_i, b_i)` for `i=1...n`. This pairing strategy generally leads to a wide range of scores.\nFor example, `(a_1, b_1)` would be `min(a) + max(b)`, which is usually a high score.\n` (a_n, b_n)` would be `max(a) + min(b)`, which is usually a low score.\n\nThe problem for worst rank is equivalent to finding the minimum `k` such that it's possible to form `k` pairs `(a_p, b_q)` with `a_p + b_q >= x`.\nNo, that's not quite right. We need to find `k` such that Vasya's score is `S_V`, and `k-1` other participants have `S_O >= S_V`.\n\nLet's re-read the \"worst case scenario\" example:\n`a = [4, 3, 5, 6, 4, 4]`, `b = [8, 6, 0, 4, 3, 4]`, `x = 7`.\nSorted `a`: `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\nSorted `b`: `[0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\nWorst case output: 5.\nExample pairing: `{4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}`. Vasya earns 4+3=7.\nScores: `12, 10, 10, 9, 7, 3`.\nIf Vasya gets 7 points, there are 4 participants with scores `12, 10, 10, 9` (all `>7`). So Vasya is 5th.\n\nThis pairing `(4,8), (4,6), (6,4), (5,4), (4,3), (3,0)` is generated by sorting `a` and `b` and then pairing them up to maximize sums.\nSort `a` ascending: `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\nSort `b` ascending: `[0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\nTo maximize scores, we want to pair large `a`'s with large `b`'s.\nIf we sort `a` ascending and `b` descending:\n`a`: `[3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]`\n`b`: `[8, 6, 4, 4, 3, 0]`\nPairs `(a_i, b_i)`:\n`(3, 8) -> 11`\n`(4, 6) -> 10`\n`(4, 4) -> 8`\n`(4, 4) -> 8`\n`(5, 3) -> 8`\n`(6, 0) -> 6`\nScores: `[11, 10, 8, 8, 8, 6]`\nIf Vasya gets 6 points, there are 5 people with `S_O >= 6`. Vasya is 6th. This is worse than 5th.\nBut Vasya must get at least `x=7` points. So Vasya cannot get 6 points.\n\nLet's try to match `a_i` with `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nWe want to find the maximum number of participants `k` such that they all have total scores `S_O >= S_V`, including Vasya.\nThis is a standard matching problem. Sort `a` in ascending order. For each `a_i`, we want to find a `b_j` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`. To maximize the number of such pairs, we use a greedy approach.\nSort `a` in ascending order.\nSort `b` in ascending order.\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, b_j)` such that `a_i + b_j >= x`.\nLet's use a two-pointer approach.\nInitialize `count = 0`.\nPointer `i` for `a` starts at 0.\nPointer `j` for `b` starts at `n-1`.\nWhile `i < n` and `j >= 0`:\n  If `a[i] + b[j] >= x`:\n    We found a valid pair. We use `a[i]` (the smallest available `a`) and `b[j]` (the largest available `b`). This pairing technique maximizes the chance of meeting the `x` threshold for the current `a[i]`.\n    `count += 1`\n    `i += 1`\n    `j -= 1`\n  Else (`a[i] + b[j] < x`):\n    The current `a[i]` is too small to pair even with the largest available `b[j]` to reach `x`. So, `a[i]` cannot form a pair that sums to `x` or more with any remaining `b` score. We must try a larger `a`.\n    `i += 1`\n\nThe `count` found by this algorithm represents the maximum number of participants that *can* achieve a score of at least `x`.\nIf `count` participants can achieve `x` or more, then Vasya could be one of them.\nIf Vasya is one of these `count` participants, and all `count` participants are assigned scores `>= x`, and the remaining `n - count` participants are assigned scores `< x`, then Vasya's worst rank could be `count`. This is because all `count` participants have scores meeting the criteria, and due to tie-breaking, Vasya could be placed last among them.\n\nLet's verify this for the example:\n`a = [3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]` (sorted ascending)\n`b = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 8]` (sorted ascending)\n`x = 7`\n\n`i=0, j=5, a[0]=3, b[5]=8`. `3+8 = 11 >= 7`. Count = 1. `i=1, j=4`.\n`i=1, j=4, a[1]=4, b[4]=6`. `4+6 = 10 >= 7`. Count = 2. `i=2, j=3`.\n`i=2, j=3, a[2]=4, b[3]=4`. `4+4 = 8 >= 7`. Count = 3. `i=3, j=2`.\n`i=3, j=2, a[3]=4, b[2]=4`. `4+4 = 8 >= 7`. Count = 4. `i=4, j=1`.\n`i=4, j=1, a[4]=5, b[1]=3`. `5+3 = 8 >= 7`. Count = 5. `i=5, j=0`.\n`i=5, j=0, a[5]=6, b[0]=0`. `6+0 = 6 < 7`. `i=6`.\n`i=6`, loop terminates.\n\nThe maximum number of participants who can achieve a score of at least `x=7` is 5.\nSince Vasya is guaranteed to be one of them, his worst rank could be 5th. This matches the example output.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n1.  **Best Rank:** Always 1. Vasya can always be assigned `max(a)` and `max(b)`, which is the highest possible total score. With tie-breaking, he can be ranked 1st.\n2.  **Worst Rank:**\n    *   Sort `a` in ascending order.\n    *   Sort `b` in ascending order.\n    *   Use two pointers, `i` for `a` (starting at 0) and `j` for `b` (starting at `n-1`).\n    *   Initialize `worst_rank = 0`.\n    *   While `i < n` and `j >= 0`:\n        *   If `a[i] + b[j] >= x`: This pair can achieve at least `x` points. Increment `worst_rank`, move `i` forward (`i += 1`), and move `j` backward (`j -= 1`).\n        *   Else (`a[i] + b[j] < x`): The current `a[i]` is too small to reach `x` even with the largest available `b[j]`. So, `a[i]` cannot be part of a pair summing to `x` or more. We must discard `a[i]` and try a larger `a`. Move `i` forward (`i += 1`).\n    *   The final `worst_rank` value is the answer.\n\n**Example 1:**\n`n=5, x=2`\n`a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\nBest Rank: 1 (as established)\n\nWorst Rank:\nSorted `a`: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\nSorted `b`: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n`x = 2`\n\n`i=0, j=4, a[0]=1, b[4]=1`. `1+1=2 >= 2`. `worst_rank = 1`. `i=1, j=3`.\n`i=1, j=3, a[1]=1, b[3]=1`. `1+1=2 >= 2`. `worst_rank = 2`. `i=2, j=2`.\n`i=2, j=2, a[2]=1, b[2]=1`. `1+1=2 >= 2`. `worst_rank = 3`. `i=3, j=1`.\n`i=3, j=1, a[3]=1, b[1]=1`. `1+1=2 >= 2`. `worst_rank = 4`. `i=4, j=0`.\n`i=4, j=0, a[4]=1, b[0]=1`. `1+1=2 >= 2`. `worst_rank = 5`. `i=5, j=-1`.\nLoop terminates.\n\nWorst Rank = 5.\nOutput: `1 5`. Matches example.\n\nThis approach for worst rank seems correct and efficient.\nTime complexity: Sorting takes `O(N log N)`. The two-pointer scan takes `O(N)`.
