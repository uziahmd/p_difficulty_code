Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Algorithm for Finding an Angle in a Regular N-gon**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to write a script that takes the number of sides `n` and a target angle `a` as input, and then finds three vertices in a regular n-gon where the angle formed by those vertices is as close as possible to `a`.  It needs to output the vertices in a `v1 v2 v3` format.\n\nFirst things first, I remember that the angles in a regular n-gon relate to the inscribed angles in a circle. Each interior angle is half of the central angle subtended by the arc.  A full circle is 360 degrees, so the central angle for each side is `360/n`. Consequently, the angle formed by three vertices depends on how many sides the arc between the outer two vertices spans.\n\nLet's assume the n-gon is inscribed in a circle and number the vertices from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.  I'll need to figure out the angles I can actually create. The angle at vertex `v2` is the inscribed angle between `v1` and `v3`. It is half the central angle spanned by the arc from `v1` to `v3` (not including `v2`).\n\nLet's simplify by fixing one vertex, `v2`, as vertex 1. Then I just need to figure out `v1` and `v3`. I need to figure out the optimal \"distance\" (number of sides) between `v1` and `v3` such that it minimizes the difference between that angle and our target angle `a`.  This \"distance\" represents the number of segments on that arc.\n\nSince I am considering the arc *not* containing `v2`, let `m` be the number of segments on that arc.  The inscribed angle is `m * (180/n)`.  The smallest this number of edges can be is 1 (minimum distance).  The largest is `n-2` because `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` all need to be distinct. `v2` is on another arc.\n\nSo, the key is to find the right `m` which makes the calculated angle, `m * (180/n)`, close to the given angle `a`. I am going to have to test all possible values of `m` in the range `[1, n-2]`.\n\nI can write an efficient search. It seems obvious I'll have to use `180/n` repeatedly, so I'll pre-calculate it as `base_angle`.  Now, I need to go through all `k` values (where `k` is the number of edges on the arc between the other two vertices) from 1 to `n-2`. For each `k`, calculate the current angle as `k * base_angle`.  Then compute the absolute difference between `current_angle` and `a`. I'll keep track of the `k` that gives the smallest difference. This will give me `best_k`.  Since the function `k * (180/n)` is monotonically increasing, I can optimize this further, calculating an approximate value for `k`, `k_approx`, as `round(a / base_angle)`. Check if this value is the correct answer and if not, check neighbouring values until you find your match.\n\nNow I need to map `best_k` back to the actual vertices.  I can set `v2` as vertex 1 to make things simpler. Now I have to find `v1` and `v3` such that there are `best_k` edges between them, not including `1`. Since `v2` is 1, let's set `v1=2`.  Then the other side, `v3`, will be at `2 + best_k`. I need to be careful with the modular arithmetic here (wrap around if it's over `n`).\n\nSo `v1` will be 2. `v3` will be `2 + best_k`, handling the modulo `n` (or wrapping around).\nThis ensures that `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are distinct, and that the arc from `v1` to `v3` not including `v2` will have `best_k` edges. The angle `v1-v2-v3` will then be close to our target `a`.\nI need to be careful when `k` is close to the lower and upper bounds. The angle calculated using floats may have some small errors, but hopefully, this will be handled by taking into account the neighbouring values of the approximate `k`. I'll use `round(a / base_angle)`",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular convex `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular Polygon**\n\n1.  **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** All vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle. An angle formed by three vertices `v1, v2, v3` is an inscribed angle. Its measure is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the arc `v1v3` (the arc that does not contain `v2`).\n2.  **Central Angle per Edge:** In a regular `n`-gon, the total angle around the center is 360 degrees. Since there are `n` equal edges, each edge subtends a central angle of `360/n` degrees.\n3.  **Possible Inscribed Angles:** If the arc `v1v3` (not containing `v2`) spans `k` edges of the polygon, then the central angle subtended by this arc is `k * (360/n)` degrees. The inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` is half of this, i.e., `k * (360/n) / 2 = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n4.  **Range of `k`:** The vertices `v1, v2, v3` must be distinct. This means `k` (the number of edges on the arc `v1v3` not containing `v2`) must be at least 1. The maximum possible value for `k` occurs when `v1` and `v3` are as far apart as possible without `v2` being on their connecting arc. This means `v2` occupies one edge-segment, and `v1, v3` occupy `k` segments. The remaining `n - k - 1` segments are on the other arc (containing `v2`). Since `v1, v2, v3` are distinct, there must be at least one edge on the arc containing `v2`. No, a simpler way is: `v1, v2, v3` are 3 distinct vertices. The arc `v1v3` (not containing `v2`) can have at most `n-2` edges. (If it had `n-1` edges, then `v2` would be the only vertex not on the arc, and `v1, v3` would be adjacent to `v2`, forming an arc of `n-1` edges. But then `v1` and `v3` must be adjacent to `v2` and `v1` and `v3` must be distinct. This setup for `n-1` edges would imply `v1` and `v3` are the same vertex, which is not allowed. Or, if `v1` and `v3` are distinct, then `v2` is the only vertex on the \"other\" arc, meaning `n-1` edges on the main arc. This implies `v1` and `v3` are adjacent to `v2`. For example, `v2=2`, `v1=1`, `v3=3`. The arc `1-3` not containing `2` has 1 edge. The arc `1-3` containing `2` has `n-1` edges. This corresponds to `k=1`. The maximum `k` is `n-2`. For `n=3`, `k=1`. For `n=4`, `k=1, 2`. So `k` ranges from `1` to `n-2`.\n\nSo, the possible angles are `k * (180/n)` for `k \\in [1, n-2]`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal `k`**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` that minimizes `|k * (180/n) - a|`.\nLet `base_angle = 180.0 / n`.\nWe are looking for `k` that minimizes `|k * base_angle - a|`.\nThis is equivalent to finding `k` such that `k * base_angle` is closest to `a`.\nWe can find the ideal (real-valued) `k_optimal_float = a / base_angle`.\nThe integer `k` values closest to `k_optimal_float` are `round(k_optimal_float)` and its immediate neighbors (`round(k_optimal_float) - 1`, `round(k_optimal_float) + 1`). We only need to check these few integer values.\n\nAlgorithm to find `best_k`:\n1.  Calculate `base_angle = 180.0 / n`.\n2.  Calculate `k_optimal_float = a / base_angle`.\n3.  Generate candidate integer `k` values: `k_round = round(k_optimal_float)`. The candidates are `k_round`, `k_round - 1`, and `k_round + 1`.\n4.  Initialize `min_diff = float('inf')` and `best_k = -1`.\n5.  For each `k_val` in the candidates:\n    *   Check if `1 <= k_val <= n-2`. If not, skip this `k_val`.\n    *   Calculate `current_angle = k_val * base_angle`.\n    *   Calculate `diff = abs(current_angle - a)`.\n    *   If `diff < min_diff`:\n        *   Update `min_diff = diff`.\n        *   Update `best_k = k_val`.\n    (If `diff == min_diff`, any `k_val` is fine, so we can just keep the current `best_k` or update to `k_val`; the problem says \"any of them\").\n\n**Constructing `v1, v2, v3`**\n\nOnce `best_k` is found, we need to output three distinct vertices.\nA simple and consistent choice is:\n*   Let `v2` (the vertex of the angle) be `1`.\n*   Let `v1` (one side) be `2`.\n*   Let `v3` (the other side) be such that the arc `v1v3` (not containing `v2`) has `best_k` edges.\n    If `v2=1` and `v1=2`, then `v3` should be `(2 + best_k)`.\n    We need to handle wrap-around for `v3` if `(2 + best_k)` exceeds `n`.\n    The vertex `v3` can be calculated as `(best_k + 1) % n + 1`.\n    Let's verify this construction:\n    *   `v2 = 1`.\n    *   `v1 = 2`.\n    *   `v3_raw = 2 + best_k`.\n    *   If `v3_raw > n`, then `v3 = v3_raw - n`. Otherwise, `v3 = v3_raw`.\n    This ensures `v1, v2, v3` are distinct because `best_k >= 1` implies `v3_raw >= 3`. So `v3` will never be `1` or `2`.\n    The arc from `v1=2` to `v3=(2+best_k)` (clockwise, not containing `v2=1`) indeed spans `best_k` edges.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (n=4, a=67):**\n1.  `n=4, a=67`.\n2.  `base_angle = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`.\n3.  `k_optimal_float = 67 / 45.0 = 1.488...`.\n4.  `k_round = round(1.488...) = 1`.\n5.  Candidates for `k`: `[1, 0, 2]`.\n6.  `min_diff = float('inf')`, `best_k = -1`.\n7.  Process `k_val = 1`:\n    *   `1 <= 1 <= 4-2=2`. Valid.\n    *   `current_angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`.\n    *   `diff = abs(45.0 - 67) = 22.0`.\n    *   `min_diff = 22.0`, `best_k = 1`.\n8.  Process `k_val = 0`: Invalid (`k_val < 1`).\n9.  Process `k_val = 2`:\n    *   `1 <= 2 <= 4-2=2`. Valid.\n    *   `current_angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`.\n    *   `diff = abs(90.0 - 67) = 23.0`.\n    *   `23.0` is not less than `min_diff=22.0`. No update.\n10. Final `best_k = 1`.\n11. Construct vertices:\n    *   `v2 = 1`.\n    *   `v1 = 2`.\n    *   `v3_raw = 2 + best_k = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n    *   `v3_raw <= n` (3 <= 4), so `v3 = 3`.\n12. Output: `2 1 3`. This matches one of the example outputs.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    base_angle = 180.0 / n\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = -1\n\n    # The target angle is a.
