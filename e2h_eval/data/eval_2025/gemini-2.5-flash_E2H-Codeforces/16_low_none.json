Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**The Crazy Town Problem: A Straightforward Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Crazy Town\" problem, and it's pretty clear where the core logic lies. We're given a home, a university, and a bunch of roads. The challenge is to figure out the fewest number of road crossings needed to get from home to the university. The blocks are defined by the roads, basically half-planes, and moving from block to block means crossing a road.\n\nMy initial thought is to forget about complex pathfinding algorithms, as the geometry seems key. The problem practically hands us the solution: it's all about which roads *separate* the home and university blocks.\n\nLet's break it down: we have the home coordinates (x1, y1), university coordinates (x2, y2), and equations of the roads. Each road defines a half-plane; the sign of `ai*x + bi*y + ci` determines which side a point (x, y) is on. If the home and university end up on different sides of a road, we *have* to cross it. If they're on the same side, that road is irrelevant to the shortest path.\n\nSo, for each road, I need to check the sign of `ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci` and `ai*x2 + bi*y2 + ci`. If the signs differ, that road is a necessary crossing. If they match, it's not. The minimum number of steps is simply the count of roads where the signs are different, that's the number of crossings. Seems very elegant!\n\nThis boils down to a simple iteration through the roads, a quick sign check, and a running counter. It's essentially a geometric problem that is simplified with a single insight. We don't need any fancy graph search or anything. It’s an easy problem. Let's get to the Python code!\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of steps to travel from a starting block (containing home) to a destination block (containing the university). A step involves moving between two blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. This means crossing exactly one road.\n\nEach road, defined by the equation `ax + by + c = 0`, divides the plane into two open half-planes: `ax + by + c > 0` and `ax + by + c < 0`.\nA block is a connected region of the plane where, for every road, all points in the block lie on the same side of that road. That is, for a given block, the expression `ax + by + c` will have the same sign (or be zero, but home and university are guaranteed not to be on any road) for all points within that block, for each road.\n\nTo move from one block to an adjacent block, you must cross exactly one road. This means the two blocks are on opposite sides of that particular road, and on the same side of all other roads.\n\nWe are looking for the minimum number of steps. This is equivalent to finding the minimum number of roads one must cross to get from the block containing home to the block containing the university.\n\nConsider a single road `ax + by + c = 0`.\nLet `f(x, y) = ax + by + c`.\n1.  If `f(x1, y1)` and `f(x2, y2)` have the same sign (both positive or both negative), then both home `(x1, y1)` and university `(x2, y2)` are on the same side of this road. You do not need to cross this road to move between their respective sides.\n2.  If `f(x1, y1)` and `f(x2, y2)` have opposite signs (one positive and one negative), then home `(x1, y1)` and university `(x2, y2)` are on opposite sides of this road. To get from one side to the other, you *must* cross this road.\n\nThe minimum number of steps required is simply the count of roads for which the home and the university lie on opposite sides. Each such road *must* be crossed. Crossing any other road (where home and university are on the same side) would be an unnecessary detour if the goal is to minimize crossings.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n1.  Initialize a counter `steps = 0`.\n2.  Read the coordinates of home `(x1, y1)` and university `(x2, y2)`.\n3.  Read the number of roads `n`.\n4.  For each of the `n` roads:\n    a.  Read its coefficients `a, b, c`.\n    b.  Calculate `val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c`.\n    c.  Calculate `val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c`.\n    d.  If `val1` and `val2` have opposite signs (i.e., `val1 * val2 < 0`), increment `steps`.\n5.  Print `steps`.\n\nNote that `val1` and `val2` will never be zero because it's guaranteed that neither home nor university lies on any road.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    steps = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for home (x1, y1)\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n        # Calculate the value of ax + by + c for university (x2, y2)\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # If val1 and val2 have opposite signs, it means home and university\n        # are on opposite sides of this road.
