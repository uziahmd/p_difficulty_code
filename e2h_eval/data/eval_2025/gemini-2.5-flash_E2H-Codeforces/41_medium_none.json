There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem-Solving Journey for the Zoning Restrictions Again Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Zoning Restrictions Again\" problem.  The goal is to maximize profit by deciding the height of houses, given some constraints. It's a classic optimization problem, and the small constraints on `n`, `h`, and `m` (all up to 50) suggest that a brute-force or dynamic programming solution within a polynomial time limit will be sufficient.  The first thing to do is to understand the problem fully.  I've got `n` spots, a maximum height `h`, and `m` restrictions. Each restriction basically says \"the tallest house in this range `[l_i, r_i]` can't exceed `x_i`\". The profit comes from the square of a house's height.\n\nMy key observation here is that a restriction affects *every single* spot in its range. So, if a restriction says the tallest house in `[2, 5]` must be at most `8`, *every* house at spots 2, 3, 4, and 5 is limited to a height of 8. I need to figure out the maximum possible height for each spot, considering *all* the restrictions.\n\nI'm thinking, for each spot `j`, I can calculate `max_allowed_height_at_j`. This will be the minimum of `h` (the global max) and the `x_i` values of all the restrictions that apply to spot `j`.  It's a two-step process: find the allowable height for each position, then sum their respective profits.\n\nFormalizing this: iterate through each of the `n` spots. For each spot, look at every single one of the `m` restrictions. If the spot falls within the range of the restriction, update the maximum allowable height. After analyzing all of the restrictions, for each spot, the house should be built as tall as possible, to maximize the profit because of `a^2`. Then, the total profit is the sum of these individual `(max_allowed_height_at_j)^2`.\n\nI'm also testing this logic in my head with the given examples and verifying that everything lines up. Tracing through the examples verifies that approach is correct. For each example, after performing the iterations, the computed `max_allowed_height_at_j` seems to match up.\n\nSo, the algorithm will involve reading the input (`n`, `h`, `m`, restrictions), calculating the maximum allowable height for each spot, and then summing up the profits. The time complexity seems to be roughly O(n * m), which should be fine with the given constraints. Space complexity is O(n + m).  Let's make sure there are no edge cases, such as the `x_i` being 0, or restrictions that overlap.\n\nLet's test it with the test cases. All look good. I'm going to implement the algorithm and submit it.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the total profit from building houses on `n` spots. For each spot, we can build a house with an integer height `a` between `0` and `h`. The profit from a house of height `a` is `a^2`. There are `m` zoning restrictions, each specifying that the tallest house within a given range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints and profit function:\n1.  **Constraints:** `n, h, m` are all small, up to `50`. This suggests that a solution with complexity around `O(n*m)` or `O(n*h)` would be efficient enough.\n2.  **Profit Function:** The profit `a^2` is an increasing function for `a >= 0`. This means to maximize profit, we should always choose the largest possible height for each house, subject to all restrictions.\n\nThe key insight lies in how zoning restrictions affect individual houses. A restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` states that the *tallest* house in the range `[l_i, r_i]` must be at most `x_i`. This implies that *every single house* within that range (i.e., for any spot `j` such that `l_i <= j <= r_i`) must have a height of at most `x_i`.\n\nTherefore, for each individual spot `j` (from `1` to `n`), its maximum allowed height is determined by two factors:\n1.  The global maximum height `h`.\n2.  The `x_i` value of every restriction `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` that covers spot `j` (i.e., `l_i <= j <= r_i`).\n\nSo, for each spot `j`, its final maximum allowed height will be the minimum of `h` and all `x_i` values from restrictions that apply to `j`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Read `n`, `h`, `m`.\n    *   Store all `m` restrictions `(l_i, r_i, x_i)` in a list.\n    *   Create an array, say `max_allowed_heights`, of size `n`. Initialize all elements to `h`. This array will store the maximum permissible height for each spot. We'll use 0-indexing for this array, so `max_allowed_heights[k]` corresponds to spot `k+1`.\n\n2.  **Apply Restrictions:**\n    *   Iterate through each spot `k` from `0` to `n-1` (representing spots `1` to `n`).\n    *   For each spot `k`, iterate through all stored restrictions `(l, r, x)`:\n        *   If spot `k+1` (the 1-indexed spot number) falls within the range `[l, r]` (i.e., `l <= k+1 <= r`), then this restriction applies to spot `k`.\n        *   Update `max_allowed_heights[k] = min(max_allowed_heights[k], x)`. This ensures that `max_allowed_heights[k]` always holds the tightest (minimum) upper bound imposed by any applicable restriction, as well as the global `h`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Profit:**\n    *   Initialize `total_profit = 0`.\n    *   Iterate through the `max_allowed_heights` array. For each `height` in the array:\n        *   Add `height * height` to `total_profit`. Since we want to maximize profit and `a^2` is increasing, choosing the maximum allowed height for each house is optimal.\n\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   Print `total_profit`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (First Example):**\n`n=3, h=3, m=3`\nRestrictions: `[(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 3), (3, 3, 2)]`\n\n1.  Initialize `max_allowed_heights = [3, 3, 3]` (for spots 1, 2, 3).\n\n2.  **Process Spot 1 (index 0):** `spot_number = 1`\n    *   Restriction `(1, 1, 1)`: `1 <= 1 <= 1` is true. `max_allowed_heights[0] = min(3, 1) = 1`.\n    *   Restriction `(2, 2, 3)`: `1` is not in `[2, 2]`. No change.\n    *   Restriction `(3, 3, 2)`: `1` is not in `[3, 3]`. No change.\n    *   After processing spot 1: `max_allowed_heights = [1, 3, 3]`.\n\n3.  **Process Spot 2 (index 1):** `spot_number = 2`\n    *   Restriction `(1, 1, 1)`: `2` is not in `[1, 1]`. No change.\n    *   Restriction `(2, 2, 3)`: `2 <= 2 <= 2` is true. `max_allowed_heights[1] = min(3, 3) = 3`.\n    *   Restriction `(3, 3, 2)`: `2` is not in `[3, 3]`. No change.\n    *   After processing spot 2: `max_allowed_heights = [1, 3, 3]`.\n\n4.  **Process Spot 3 (index 2):** `spot_number = 3`\n    *   Restriction `(1, 1, 1)`: `3` is not in `[1, 1]`. No change.\n    *   Restriction `(2, 2, 3)`: `3` is not in `[2, 2]`. No change.\n    *   Restriction `(3, 3, 2)`: `3 <= 3 <= 3` is true. `max_allowed_heights[2] = min(3, 2) = 2`.\n    *   After processing spot 3: `max_allowed_heights = [1, 3, 2]`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Profit:**\n    *   `total_profit = 1*1 + 3*3 + 2*2 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Time Complexity: `O(n * m)` because we iterate through `n` spots, and for each spot, we iterate through `m` restrictions. Given `n, m <= 50`, `50 * 50 = 2500` operations, which is very fast.\n*   Space Complexity: `O(n + m)` to store `max_allowed_heights` and `restrictions`. Given `n, m <= 50`, this is very small.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, h, m from the first line of input\n    n, h, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Store all m restrictions.
