Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Substring Problem: A Pythonic Approach**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem staring me down. The task is pretty straightforward: find the length of the longest substring within a given string that repeats itself at least once. Overlapping occurrences are fair game, which is something I need to keep in mind. The input is a string `s`, and its length, let's call it `n`, is capped at 100 characters. Since the constraint is quite small, I'm thinking a brute-force solution is probably going to be good enough.\n\nMy strategy will be to methodically check substrings of decreasing length, starting with the longest possible and working my way down. This is an optimization. As soon as I find a substring length that satisfies the \"at least twice\" condition, I've got my answer.\n\nTo generate these substrings, I'll use the classic start-and-end indexing. Each substring's start index `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, and the end index `j` from `i+1` to `n`. So the substring itself is `s[i:j]`.\n\nNow, for a given length `L`, I'll iterate through all possible starting positions `i` (from `0` to `n-L`). For each substring `sub = s[i : i+L]`, I need to count its occurrences in the original string. I'll do this by iterating through the string again with starting index `k` (from `0` to `n-L`). Crucially, because overlaps are allowed, I'll simply check if `s[k : k+L]` is equal to `sub`, incrementing a counter whenever I find a match.\n\nI can optimize this further by exiting the main outer loop as soon as I find a valid length, no point in iterating down when you have an answer already.\n",
