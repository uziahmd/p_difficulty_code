            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\" problem. The core of it is figuring out the *minimum* number of tile draws needed to form a \"mentsu\" (either a koutsu or a shuntsu) given an initial hand of three tiles. The maximum number of draws is at most 2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem's components. I've got to parse the input into a usable format, define what constitutes a koutsu and shuntsu, and remember that any tile is drawable. Since I need to find the minimum number of draws, it makes sense to go in increasing order of complexity.\n\nI'll start with 0 draws. Can the initial hand form a mentsu by itself? I'll check for both koutsu and shuntsu. Representing tiles as tuples (number, suit) should make sorting and comparisons easier, especially for checking sequential numbers in a shuntsu. The input format requires a bit of parsing for each tile. Then, the koutsu check is a straightforward comparison. The shuntsu check necessitates sorting the tiles, ensuring the suits match, and that the numbers are sequential.\n\nIf no mentsu is found with 0 draws, I need to check the 1-draw case. Since I can draw *any* tile, this gets trickier. If I have three initial tiles, and draw one extra, I'll need to check if there is a mentsu out of all possible combinations of three tiles. I'll need to think about cases. How can I draw one tile such that, combined with the initial three, a mentsu is created?\n\nIt seems a *brute-force* approach of iterating every possible drawn tile won't be efficient since that is an infinite amount of possibilities. Instead, I think, for each pair of initial tiles, what extra tile is needed to create either a koutsu or a shuntsu?\nI can check for pairs of identical tiles to fulfill the koutsu condition. For a shuntsu, if tiles are of the same suit and the numbers differ by 1 or 2, then with one draw it can form a sequence.  I need to check *every* combination of the original tiles for the one-draw conditions.\n\nIf 0 or 1 draw doesn't work, then a 2-draw must be sufficient. Two draws means with the existing tiles, there are 5 tiles. Any three out of those five could be the mentsu, so it means in the worst-case scenario, any drawn tile could complete a koutsu. The problem asks for the minimum. Since 0 or 1 isn't sufficient, the answer must be 2.\n\nNow, I'll put all of this together in a Python script. Parsing the input, representing tiles, checking for 0 draws, and checking for 1 draw, in that order, with print statements for each case.  I need to ensure the logic and code correctly and efficiently handles all possible scenarios to determine the minimum draws.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form at least one mentsu (meld). A mentsu can be a koutsu (triplet of identical tiles) or a shuntsu (sequence of three sequential tiles of the same suit). She starts with three tiles. She can draw any tiles she wants, and there's an infinite supply of each tile type.\n\nWe need to check for 0, 1, and 2 draws in that order. The maximum possible answer is 2, because if 0 or 1 draw doesn't suffice, she can always draw two copies of any tile she already possesses (e.g., draw two '1m' tiles if she has '1m') to form a koutsu of three identical tiles.\n\nLet's represent each tile as a tuple `(number, suit_character)`. For example, \"1s\" becomes `(1, 's')`.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Parse Input and Sort Tiles**:\n    Read the three tile strings. Convert them into `(number, suit)` tuples. Sort these tuples. A consistent sort order (e.g., by suit then by number) simplifies checking for sequences.\n\n2.  **Check for 0 Draws**:\n    *   **Koutsu**: Check if all three initial tiles are identical. If `tile[0] == tile[1]` and `tile[1] == tile[2]`, she already has a koutsu.\n    *   **Shuntsu**: Check if all three initial tiles have the same suit AND their numbers are sequential (e.g., `n, n+1, n+2`). If `tile[0].suit == tile[1].suit == tile[2].suit` AND `tile[0].number + 1 == tile[1].number` AND `tile[1].number + 1 == tile[2].number`, she already has a shuntsu.\n    *   If either condition is met, print `0` and exit.\n\n3.  **Check for 1 Draw**:\n    If 0 draws are not sufficient, we check if one extra tile can complete a mentsu. This means we need to find if any two of the initial three tiles, combined with one drawn tile, can form a mentsu.\n    We iterate through all possible pairs of the initial three tiles: `(t1, t2)`, `(t1, t3)`, `(t2, t3)`. For each pair `(t_a, t_b)`:\n    *   **Koutsu**: If `t_a == t_b`, she has a pair of identical tiles. Drawing a third identical tile (`t_a` or `t_b`) completes a koutsu.\n    *   **Shuntsu**: If `t_a.suit == t_b.suit`:\n        *   If their numbers differ by 1 (e.g., `3p, 4p`), drawing the tile `(min(num_a, num_b) - 1, suit)` or `(max(num_a, num_b) + 1, suit)` forms a shuntsu (if the number is valid, i.e., 1-9).\n        *   If their numbers differ by 2 (e.g., `3p, 5p`), drawing the tile `(min(num_a, num_b) + 1, suit)` forms a shuntsu.\n    *   If any of these conditions are met for any pair, print `1` and exit.\n\n4.  **If 2 Draws are Needed**:\n    If neither 0 nor 1 draw is sufficient, it means 2 draws are required. As discussed, she can always draw two copies of any of her existing tiles (e.g., two `t1` tiles) to form a koutsu `[t1, t1, t1]`. So, the answer is `2`. Print `2` and exit.\n\nThis covers all cases and finds the minimum number of draws.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s_tiles = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    tiles = []\n    for s_tile in s_tiles:\n        num = int(s_tile[0])\n        suit = s_tile[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Sort tiles.
