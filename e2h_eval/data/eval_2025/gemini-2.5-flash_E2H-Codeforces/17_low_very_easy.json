He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down the Prefixes and Suffixes Problem**\n\nOkay, so I've got this competitive programming problem called \"Prefixes and Suffixes.\" The gist is this: I'm given the length of an original string, `n`, and then a list of `2n-2` strings.  These strings are all the *improper* prefixes and suffixes of the original string – basically, all the prefixes and suffixes, excluding the string itself. For each length from 1 to `n-1`, I'm guaranteed to have *exactly* one prefix and one suffix. My goal is to figure out whether each of those input strings is a prefix or a suffix and output a string of \"P\"s and \"S\"s accordingly. The crucial constraint here is that there must be the same number of prefixes and suffixes, namely `n-1`. I'm assured that there's always a valid solution, so I don't need to worry about impossible inputs.\n\nThe core of this feels like reconstructing the original string somehow.  I know that the longest prefix and suffix will be of length `n-1`, so that's where I need to start. There are only two strings of length `n-1` amongst the input, and those *must* be the prefix and suffix of length `n-1` of the original string.  Let's call these strings `str1` and `str2`.\n\nNow, if `str1` is the actual prefix and `str2` is the actual suffix of length `n-1`, that would mean the original string, `s`, could be formed by appending the last character of `str2` to `str1`, or appending the first character of `str1` to `str2`. But there's a consistency check I can do: the condition `str1[1:] == str2[:-1]` must be satisfied for `str1` and `str2` to be valid. In other words, the core portion of the prefix must be equal to the core portion of the suffix. If this condition holds, I've likely got the original string figured out.\n\nBasically, I need to find these two special strings of length `n-1`.  Then, I'll compare them and identify whether the condition holds for the original string to be reconstructed. Then, for the other strings, I can determine whether each one is a prefix or a suffix.  Seems doable!\n",
