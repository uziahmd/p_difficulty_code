Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Problem Decomposition and Algorithm Refinement**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with writing a Python script to determine if an `n x n` grid of characters forms an \"X\" shape according to these specific rules. The constraints are pretty clear: `n` is an odd number between 3 and 299. The \"X\" has to have the same character on both main diagonals, another different character everywhere else, and those two characters must be different from each other.\n\nInitially, I broke down the problem into these steps: reading the input grid, identifying the diagonal character, identifying the non-diagonal character, and finally, checking if they are different. However, I realized I could optimize the approach by combining the diagonal and non-diagonal character verification into a single loop, making the code more efficient.\n\nFirst, I'd read the grid into a 2D data structure.  Then, I'd initialize two character variables: `diag_char` and `other_char`. I could safely initialize `diag_char` with the character at `grid[0][0]` and `other_char` with the character at `grid[0][1]`. The problem's constraints (`n >= 3`) ensure these indices are always valid. Then, I iterate through the grid: if a cell is on either diagonal, I check if its value matches `diag_char`; otherwise, it should match `other_char`. If any mismatch occurs, it's not an \"X\", so I'd print \"NO\" and exit.  After the loop, if all cells have passed the check, I need to make sure that `diag_char` and `other_char` are actually different, and if they are the same, it is not an \"X\". Otherwise, it's a \"YES\".\n\n**Edge Case Handling and Algorithm Validation**\n\nI also considered edge cases:  since `n` is odd, the center element is always on both diagonals, but it won't affect anything, and the approach is solid. The problem statement guarantees `n >= 3`, which simplifies things significantly, ensuring the existence of non-diagonal characters and avoiding a need to check for a degenerate 1x1 grid or similar cases.\n\nI carefully went through the example walkthrough with the optimization. The updated algorithm works great, accurately processing the example inputs. I added comprehensive comments.\n\n**Implementation and Input/Output**\n\nFor the input/output part, the description says read input from standard input. So, I would use `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency. I also used `sys.stdout.write()` for output for consistency. This is standard practice in competitive programming for fast I/O. For the final version, I decided to use the robust method of retrieving the grid dimensions, reading each row in a loop, and printing the results based on the previous logic. I'll need to remember to strip the newline character from each line of input.\n\nThis seems to be the most efficient and robust solution.\n",
