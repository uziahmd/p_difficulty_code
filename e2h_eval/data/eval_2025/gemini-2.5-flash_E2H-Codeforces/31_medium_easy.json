            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Vanya and Cards\n\nVanya loves playing. He even has a special set of cards to play with. Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Solving Vanya's Card Problem: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm diving into this Vanya and Cards problem. The goal is to figure out the fewest cards Vanya needs to add so his total card sum becomes zero. I've got a list of cards, each with a number between `-x` and `x`, and I can grab as many cards as I want with those values.\n\nFirst, I need to get the current total of the existing cards. Then, I calculate the \"needed\" sum to reach zero. That's just the negative of the current sum, so let's call it `needed_sum`. What's important is the *absolute value* of that `needed_sum` because I can add positive or negative cards.\n\nSince I want the minimum number of extra cards, I should use the largest possible number available which is `x` (or `-x` depending on if the original sum is positive or negative) in these cards. Think of it like a greedy approach: use the biggest cards as often as possible.\n\nTo figure out how many cards to add, I divide the absolute value of the `needed_sum` by `x`. But wait, I need to \"round up\" because even if the division isn't a whole number, I still need at least one card. So that's where the ceiling function comes in, or more practically, integer division trick which calculates `(abs_needed_sum + x - 1) // x`.\n\nLet's test this with the examples. The algorithm works as expected. Seems good so far.\n\nNow, for any edge cases, like, what if the sum is already zero? Well, I don't need any extra cards so the result is correctly zero in those cases. The formula `(abs_needed_sum + x - 1) // x` works in this case too.\n\nI should also make sure my plan considers performance. I know the sum of `n` cards will be small enough to work. I'm going to set up a nice Python script that's ready to handle the input, perform the calculations, and give the correct answer.\n\nSeems like I have a complete and effective plan! Let's get coding.\n",
