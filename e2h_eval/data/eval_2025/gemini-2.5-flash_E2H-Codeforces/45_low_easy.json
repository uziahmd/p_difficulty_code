There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the Tennis Championship Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"Tennis Championship\" problem. It's essentially about figuring out the maximum number of games a tournament winner can play under a specific constraint: the game count difference between two players in a match can be at most one.  It's a knockout format, so the winner keeps progressing, playing and winning games.\n\nMy initial thought is to work through some small examples to get a feel for the problem. For `n=2`, it's obvious the winner plays just one game. With `n=3`, it's a bit more interesting, the winner can reach 2 games. This leads me to believe a winner can reach n-1 games. \n\nNow, with `n=4`, I start visualizing the match structure. I start by assuming the winner plays two games, but I quickly realize that the constraint creates a tricky bottleneck. If I structure it linearly, the constraint isn't always satisfied. So, clearly, a linear or sequential approach may not be the optimal strategy. I see that the order of the matches has a massive impact on the game count of the winner.\n\nThe key insight seems to be how to efficiently pair players. I need to focus on how game counts are increased and how they impact possible matches. It looks like the constraint forces me to keep the game counts of players within a narrow range, creating a sort of balancing act.\n\nThis means I need to think about rounds and game counts in each round. If I have players with `k` games and players with `k-1` games, I can potentially have matches between them. I'll need to figure out how many such matches I can have to maximize the winner's games. My intuition is telling me that there's a pattern related to some sort of binary or tree-like structure here. The solution may be exponential.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks for the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tournament can play, given a specific rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.\n\nLet `f(k)` be the minimum number of players required to produce a winner who has played exactly `k` games, following the given rule. We want to find the maximum `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\n\nLet's analyze the rule: if player A has played `g_A` games and player B has played `g_B` games, they can play if `abs(g_A - g_B) <= 1`. The winner of this game will have played `max(g_A, g_B) + 1` games.\n\nConsider the players who are still in the tournament. To maximize the winner's games, we want to ensure that the winner always plays an opponent whose game count is either equal to theirs or one less.\n\nLet's trace the number of players needed for a winner to play `k` games:\n- To play 0 games: This is the initial state. A player has played 0 games. We need 1 player to be in this state. So, `f(0) = 1`.\n- To play 1 game: A player must win one game. This means they played against an opponent who had 0 games. This requires 2 players initially (winner 0 games, loser 0 games). `f(1) = 2`.\n- To play 2 games: A player (P1) wins their first game, so P1 has 1 game. To play a second game, P1 (1 game) must play against an opponent (P2) who has either 0 or 1 game.\n    - If P1 (1 game) plays P2 (0 games): P1 wins, P1 now has 2 games. This requires P1 (winner of 1 game), P2 (loser of 0 game), and the player P1 beat in the first game. This doesn't seem like a minimal setup.\n    - Let's think about the *number of players* required.\n    To get a winner with `k` games, that winner must have won their `k`-th game. In that `k`-th game, the winner (W) had `k-1` games, and the opponent (O) had either `k-1` or `k-2` games.\n    If O had `k-1` games, then W and O both had `k-1` games. To get two players with `k-1` games, we need `f(k-1)` players for W and `f(k-1)` players for O. So, `2 * f(k-1)` players in total.\n    If O had `k-2` games, then W had `k-1` games and O had `k-2` games. To get W with `k-1` games, we need `f(k-1)` players. To get O with `k-2` games, we need `f(k-2)` players. So, `f(k-1) + f(k-2)` players in total.\n    To minimize the total number of players for a winner with `k` games, we should choose the smaller of these two options. However, the rule is about *who can play whom*. The structure of the tournament matters.\n\nLet's define `f(k)` as the minimum number of players required to have *one winner* who has played exactly `k` games, such that all other players are eliminated.\n\n- `f(0) = 1` (A single player is considered a \"winner\" who played 0 games if no other players exist).\n- `f(1) = 2` (Player A (0 games) beats Player B (0 games). A has 1 game. Total 2 players).\n- `f(2)`:\n    - Option 1: A (1 game) beats B (0 games). A has 2 games.\n        To get A with 1 game, we need 2 players (A and A's first opponent).\n        To get B with 0 games, we need 1 player (B itself).\n        Total players = `f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n    - Option 2: A (1 game) beats B (1 game). A has 2 games.\n        To get A with 1 game, we need `f(1)=2` players.\n        To get B with 1 game, we need `f(1)=2` players.\n        Total players = `f(1) + f(1) = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n    The minimal number of players for a winner to play 2 games is 3. So, `f(2) = 3`. (Example: P1 beats P2 (P1:1, P2:elim), then P1 beats P3 (P1:2, P3:elim). Total 3 players).\n\n- `f(3)`:\n    - Option 1: A (2 games) beats B (1 game). A has 3 games.\n        Players for A with 2 games: `f(2) = 3`.\n        Players for B with 1 game: `f(1) = 2`.\n        Total players = `f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5`.\n    - Option 2: A (2 games) beats B (2 games). A has 3 games.\n        Players for A with 2 games: `f(2) = 3`.\n        Players for B with 2 games: `f(2) = 3`.\n        Total players = `f(2) + f(2) = 3 + 3 = 6`.\n    The minimal number of players for a winner to play 3 games is 5. So, `f(3) = 5`.\n\n- `f(4)`:\n    - Option 1: A (3 games) beats B (2 games). A has 4 games.\n        Players for A with 3 games: `f(3) = 5`.\n        Players for B with 2 games: `f(2) = 3`.\n        Total players = `f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8`.\n    - Option 2: A (3 games) beats B (3 games). A has 4 games.\n        Players for A with 3 games: `f(3) = 5`.\n        Players for B with 3 games: `f(3) = 5`.\n        Total players = `f(3) + f(3) = 5 + 5 = 10`.\n    The minimal number of players for a winner to play 4 games is 8. So, `f(4) = 8`.\n\nThe sequence `f(k)` appears to be the Fibonacci sequence:\n`f(0) = 1`\n`f(1) = 2`\n`f(2) = 3`\n`f(3) = 5`\n`f(4) = 8`\n...\nIt looks like `f(k) = fib(k+2)`, where `fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, fib(4)=3, fib(5)=5, fib(6)=8, ...`\nMore commonly, if `fib(1)=1, fib(2)=1, fib(3)=2, fib(4)=3, fib(5)=5, fib(6)=8`, then `f(k) = fib(k+2)`.\nLet's verify the recurrence `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)` for `k >= 2`. This corresponds to the strategy where the winner (with `k-1` games) plays an opponent who has `k-2` games. This strategy always uses fewer players than if the winner (with `k-1` games) plays an opponent who also has `k-1` games (which would require `2 * f(k-1)` players).\n\nSo, the sequence `f(k)` is:\n`f_0 = 1`\n`f_1 = 2`\n`f_k = f_{k-1} + f_{k-2}` for `k >= 2`.\n\nWe are given `n` players and need to find the maximum `k` such that `f_k <= n`.\nWe can generate the Fibonacci-like sequence until `f_k` exceeds `n`.\n\nGiven `n` can be up to `10^18`, we need an efficient way to calculate `f_k` and find `k`.\nWe can simply iterate:\n`a = 1` (representing `f_0`)\n`b = 2` (representing `f_1`)\n`k = 1` (current max games for winner)\n\nIf `n = 2`:\n`a=1, b=2, k=1`. `b <= n` is `2 <= 2`, true.\nNext iteration: `temp = b = 2`. `b = a + b = 1 + 2 = 3`. `a = temp = 2`. `k = k + 1 = 2`.\nNow `a=2, b=3, k=2`. `b <= n` is `3 <= 2`, false.\nThe loop stops. The previous `k` was `1`. So the answer is 1.\n\nIf `n = 3`:\n`a=1, b=2, k=1`. `b <= n` is `2 <= 3`, true.\nNext iteration: `temp = b = 2`. `b = a + b = 1 + 2 = 3`. `a = temp = 2`. `k = k + 1 = 2`.\nNow `a=2, b=3, k=2`. `b <= n` is `3 <= 3`, true.\nNext iteration: `temp = b = 3`. `b = a + b = 2 + 3 = 5`. `a = temp = 3`. `k = k + 1 = 3`.\nNow `a=3, b=5, k=3`. `b <= n` is `5 <= 3`, false.\nThe loop stops. The previous `k` was `2`. So the answer is 2.\n\nIf `n = 4`:\n`a=1, b=2, k=1`. `b <= n` is `2 <= 4`, true.\nNext iteration: `temp = b = 2`. `b = a + b = 1 + 2 = 3`. `a = temp = 2`. `k = k + 1 = 2`.\nNow `a=2, b=3, k=2`. `b <= n` is `3 <= 4`, true.\nNext iteration: `temp = b = 3`. `b = a + b = 2 + 3 = 5`. `a = temp = 3`. `k = k + 1 = 3`.\nNow `a=3, b=5, k=3`. `b <= n` is `5 <= 4`, false.\nThe loop stops. The previous `k` was `2`. So the answer is 2.\n\nIf `n = 10`:\n`a=1, b=2, k=1`. `b <= n` is `2 <= 10`, true.\n`a=2, b=3, k=2`. `b <= n` is `3 <= 10`, true.\n`a=3, b=5, k=3`. `b <= n` is `5 <= 10`, true.\n`a=5, b=8, k=4`. `b <= n` is `8 <= 10`, true.\n`a=8, b=13, k=5`. `b <= n` is `13 <= 10`, false.\nThe loop stops. The previous `k` was `4`. So the answer is 4.\n\nThe logic seems correct. The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so this iterative approach will be very fast even for `n = 10^18`. The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence up to `10^18` is roughly `log_phi(10^18)` which is about `18 * log_phi(10) approx 18 * 2.07 approx 37`. So, around 40-50 iterations will be sufficient.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    # Base cases for the number of players needed for a winner to play k games.\n    # f_k: minimum players for winner to play k games.\n    # f_0 = 1 (a player who played 0 games)\n    # f_1 = 2 (a player beats another player, winner played 1 game)\n    # f_k = f_{k-1} + f_{k-2} for k >= 2\n    # This sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... which is Fibonacci-like.\n    # If standard Fibonacci is F_0=0, F_1=1, F_2=1, F_3=2, F_4=3, F_5=5, F_6=8...\n    # Then f_k = F_{k+2}\n\n    # We want to find the maximum k such that f_k <= n.\n\n    if n == 2:\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Initialize with f_0 and f_1\n    # 'a' will store f_{current_k-1}\n    # 'b' will store f_{current_k}\n    # 'k_val' will store the current number of games for the winner\n    a = 2  # Represents f_1 (winner plays 1 game, needs 2 players)\n    b = 3  # Represents f_2 (winner plays 2 games, needs 3 players)\n    k_val = 2 # Current number of games for the winner (corresponds to 'b')\n\n    # Iterate until b (f_k) exceeds n\n    while b <= n:\n        next_b = a + b\n        a = b\n        b = next_b\n        k_val += 1\n    \n    # When the loop exits, 'b' is the first f_k that is greater than n.\n    # So, the maximum k for which f_k <= n is the previous k_val.\n    # The current k_val corresponds to 'b', so the previous k_val is k_val - 1.\n    print(k_val - 1)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
