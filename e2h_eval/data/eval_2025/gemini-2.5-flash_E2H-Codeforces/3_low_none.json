Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Breaking Down \"Vanya and Lanterns\"**\n\nAlright, I'm facing the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem, and I'm strategizing how to tackle this efficiently with a Python script. My understanding is this: I have a street of length `l` and `n` lanterns. Each lantern, positioned at `a_i`, illuminates a range of `d` on either side. My objective is to determine the *minimum* value of `d` required to ensure the entire street, from 0 to `l`, is lit.\n\n**Simplifying with Sorting & Gap Analysis**\n\nThe key insight here is that the positions of the lanterns will matter. Sorting the lantern positions, `a_i`, seems like a good starting point. This transforms the problem into analyzing gaps between sorted lanterns and the ends of the street. I'll call the sorted positions `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}`.\n\nThe initial and final segments are important:\n\n*   **Beginning:** To light the start of the street, `[0, a_0]`, my radius `d` has to be at least `a_0` (as `a_0 - d <= 0`). Let's call this requirement `d_start = a_0`.\n*   **End:** Similarly, the segment `[a_{n-1}, l]` requires that `a_{n-1} + d >= l`, which means `d >= l - a_{n-1}`.  Let's call this `d_end = l - a_{n-1}`.\n*   **Gaps:** For the segments between the lanterns, say between `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`, I need to calculate the gap's maximum width. The lantern at `a_i` covers `[a_i - d, a_i + d]` and the lantern at `a_{i+1}` covers `[a_{i+1} - d, a_{i+1} + d]`. The condition for complete coverage requires `a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d`, hence `2d >= a_{i+1} - a_i`, or `d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2`. The largest value of `(a_{i+1} - a_i)/2` between all lantern pairs will be crucial. I'll refer to this as `d_gap`.\n\n**Finding the Minimal Radius**\n\nThe solution will be the *maximum* among `d_start`, `d_end`, and `d_gap`. This ensures that all gaps and ends are adequately lit. I'll formalize this as `d = max(d_start, d_end, d_gap)`.\n\n**Python Implementation Plan**\n\nMy Python script will do the following:\n\n1.  Read the input: `n` and `l`.\n2.  Read the lantern positions `a_i` into a list.\n3.  Sort the `a` list.\n4.  Initialize `max_d` to `0.0`. Using a float ensures the precision requirement of `10^-9`.\n5.  Calculate `d_start`: `max_d = max(max_d, float(a[0]))`.\n6.  Calculate `d_end`: `max_d = max(max_d, float(l - a[n-1]))`.\n7.  Iterate to compute the largest gap, or `d_gap`:\n    *   Iterate through the sorted positions and compute `(a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2` for each pair.\n    *   `max_d = max(max_d, float((a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2))`\n8.  Finally, print `max_d`.\n\nI think this strategy should efficiently solve the \"Vanya and Lanterns\" problem.\n",
