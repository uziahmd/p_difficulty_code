The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through Xenia and Ringroad**\n\nOkay, so I need to create a Python script to solve this \"Xenia and Ringroad\" problem. Let's break it down. We have `n` houses in a circle, numbered 1 to `n`, and `m` tasks. Each task `a_i` specifies a house where Xenia needs to go, in order. Movement is clockwise only. Initially, she's at house 1, and we need the minimum total time.\n\nFirst, I'll need to keep track of Xenia's `current_house` (initially 1) and a `total_time` (initially 0).\n\nFor each task `a_i`:\n\n1.  I'm at `current_house`.\n2.  I need to get to house `a_i`.\n3.  Since it's clockwise only, the time calculation is crucial.\n\nIf `a_i` is greater than or equal to `current_house`, it's a simple `a_i - current_house`. But what if `a_i` is less than `current_house`? It's where the ringroad aspect comes in.\n\nIf `a_i` is less than `current_house`, I have to think about going all the way around. Let me visualize... I'm at, say, house 5 and need to go to house 2. I have to go from 5 to `n`, then from `n` to 1, and then from 1 to 2.\n\nLet me think through the cases...\n*   If `a_i >= current_house`: the distance is `a_i - current_house`.\n*   If `a_i < current_house`: I move from `current_house` to `n`. That's `n - current_house` steps. Then from `n` to `a_i`. This is basically a wrap-around, and the distance is a bit tricky to visualize in terms of the formula, so let me reason in terms of what I know to be correct: From `n` to `1` is 1 step. From `1` to `a_i`, which means the time taken is simply `a_i`.  But wait a minute, the total time should be the time from `current_house` to `n`, plus the number of steps to `a_i`. That's `(n - current_house)` plus `a_i`.\n*   The total time for the wrap-around scenario seems to be `(n - current_house + a_i)`.\n*   After each task, I'll update `current_house` to `a_i`, and add the time calculated to `total_time`.\n\nOkay, I think I have a clear algorithm. I can now write the Python code. I'll test it thoroughly with various edge cases to be sure.\n",
