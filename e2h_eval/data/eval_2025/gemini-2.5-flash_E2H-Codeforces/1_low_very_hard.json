The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Deconstructing the Gilded Cell Calculation**\n\nOkay, so I need to craft a Python script to determine the total number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate's dimensions are `w` and `h`, and there are `k` gilded rings.  The challenge lies in efficiently calculating the number of cells within each ring, which is essentially the border of a shrinking rectangle.\n\nThe problem defines the inner rectangle for the `i`-th ring as having dimensions `w_i = w - 4(i - 1)` and `h_i = h - 4(i - 1)`. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.  I need a reliable formula to compute the perimeter of a rectangle.\n\nMy initial thought was to use the formula `2W + 2H - 4` for a rectangle of size `W x H`. However, I realized that this doesn't consistently work when either `W` or `H` is less than 2. For instance, consider a `5x1` rectangle.  The formula returns 8, but there are only 5 border cells.\n\nI explored an alternative: `W * H - (W-2) * (H-2)`.  This seemed promising initially, but again, it falls apart when `W` or `H` is small, specifically when the inner rectangle (W-2) * (H-2) doesn't exist.\n\nThe more standard perimeter formula, `2 * (W + H - 2)`, also presents issues.  I've come to the conclusion that it also has trouble when W or H is small.\n\nI need to find a way to handle these edge cases where the inner rectangle might disappear (e.g., leaving just a line). This should involve adjusting the perimeter calculation based on whether the resulting inner rectangles are valid. I'll need to check the dimensions and handle scenarios where the inner rectangle collapses into a line or disappears completely, potentially requiring a simplified perimeter computation in these instances.\n",
