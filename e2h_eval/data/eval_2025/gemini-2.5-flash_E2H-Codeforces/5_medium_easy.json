Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's how I'm thinking about solving this \"Colored Boots\" problem:**\n\nFirst, I need to really *get* the problem. We have `n` left and `n` right boots, each with a color. Colors can either be specific letters (like 'a', 'b', etc.) or the wildcard '?'. Two boots match if they have the same specific color, *or* if one or both are '?'. The goal is to maximize the number of matching pairs. This is a classic greedy problem.\n\nMy initial thought is, the best approach is to match the most restrictive cases *first*. This means, if there are boots of the same specific color on both sides (like 'a' on the left and 'a' on the right), I should prioritize matching *those* first. They're the most constrained. This way, if an 'a' only has a '?' to match, it doesn't get \"wasted\" when it could have matched with another 'a'.  The '?'s are the most flexible, so I'll deal with them last.\n\nTo make things efficient, I'll need some data structures. I'll create a list or array to store the indices (positions) of each specific color on both the left and right sides. I'll also need separate lists for the '?' boots on each side.  So, I'll have something like `left_specific_colors` and `right_specific_colors`, where each is a list of lists. The index of the inner list in `left_specific_colors` represents the letter, and the contents are the *positions* of all the 'a's, 'b's, and so on. Similarly for right boots.  I'll also have  `left_q` and `right_q` to store positions of the '?'.\n\nThe core of the strategy is this:\n\n1.  **Exact Matches First:** Loop through each specific color ('a' to 'z').  As long as I have both left and right boots of that same color, I'll pair them up and remove them from their lists.\n\n2.  **Specific to '?':** Now, for each color, I'll see if there are any remaining boots of that specific color and pair them up with available '?'.  If there are boots of 'a' left, and a '?' on the right, I'll match them. This step is also done in both directions -- left to right and right to left.\n\n3.  **'?' to '?':** Finally, match up any remaining '?' boots with each other.\n\nThe greedy approach works because, by matching the exact colors first, I'm ensuring I'm not making a suboptimal choice that would block potential matches later. Matching '?' last gives me maximum flexibility.\n\nIn terms of data structures, it's very important to keep it efficient. I'm choosing lists to store indices because I need fast lookups and removals. Python's `list.pop()` is O(1) for popping from the end, and this fits my needs well for storing the boot index. I'll use list comprehension to populate them. The worst case will be `O(n)`.  The algorithm, with the data structures used, will also be O(N).\n\nI'll output the total number of pairs and then list the pairs with 1-based indexing for the boots. I'm now pretty confident this approach is both correct and efficient for the constraints.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Compatibility rules are:\n1. Two specific colors are compatible if they are identical (e.g., 'f' and 'f').\n2. An indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any other color (specific or indefinite).\n\nWe are given `n` left boots and `n` right boots, represented by two strings `l` and `r`. We need to output the total number of pairs and the 1-indexed indices of the boots in each pair.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core idea is to prioritize matches based on their restrictiveness. More restrictive matches should be made first to ensure they don't block potentially more flexible matches later.\n\n1.  **Exact specific color matches (e.g., 'a' with 'a'):** These are the most restrictive. If a left boot of color 'a' and a right boot of color 'a' are available, pairing them is the best choice. This uses up two specific-colored boots, leaving '?' boots available for other specific colors that might not have an exact match.\n\n2.  **Specific color to '?' matches (e.g., 'a' with '?' or '?' with 'a'):** After all exact specific matches are made, some specific-colored boots might remain (if they didn't find an exact match), and all '?' boots are still available. These matches are less restrictive than exact specific matches but more restrictive than '?' to '?' matches. We pair any remaining specific-colored boots with available '?' boots.\n\n3.  **'?' to '?' matches:** These are the least restrictive. Any remaining '?' left boots can be paired with any remaining '?' right boots. By doing these last, we ensure that '?' boots are used only if they can't form a specific-to-'?' match, maximizing overall pairs.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1.  **Data Structures:**\n    *   To efficiently find available boots of a certain color, we'll store the 0-indexed positions of boots in lists.\n    *   `left_specific_colors[char_code]` and `right_specific_colors[char_code]`: Lists for specific colors 'a' through 'z'. `char_code` would be `ord(char) - ord('a')`.\n    *   `left_q` and `right_q`: Lists for boots with '?' color.\n\n2.  **Populate Data Structures:**\n    *   Iterate from `i = 0` to `n-1`.\n    *   If `l[i]` is `'?'`, add `i` to `left_q`. Otherwise, add `i` to `left_specific_colors[ord(l[i]) - ord('a')]`.\n    *   Do the same for `r[i]` and `right_q`/`right_specific_colors`.\n\n3.  **Matching Process:**\n    *   Initialize an empty list `pairs` to store the results.\n    *   **Step 1: Exact Specific Matches:**\n        *   Iterate `i` from 0 to 25 (representing 'a' to 'z').\n        *   While both `left_specific_colors[i]` and `right_specific_colors[i]` are not empty:\n            *   Pop an index `idx_l` from `left_specific_colors[i]`.\n            *   Pop an index `idx_r` from `right_specific_colors[i]`.\n            *   Add `(idx_l + 1, idx_r + 1)` (1-indexed) to `pairs`.\n    *   **Step 2: Specific to '?' Matches:**\n        *   Iterate `i` from 0 to 25.\n        *   While `left_specific_colors[i]` is not empty AND `right_q` is not empty:\n            *   Pop `idx_l` from `left_specific_colors[i]`.\n            *   Pop `idx_r` from `right_q`.\n            *   Add `(idx_l + 1, idx_r + 1)` to `pairs`.\n        *   While `right_specific_colors[i]` is not empty AND `left_q` is not empty:\n            *   Pop `idx_r` from `right_specific_colors[i]`.\n            *   Pop `idx_l` from `left_q`.\n            *   Add `(idx_l + 1, idx_r + 1)` to `pairs`.\n    *   **Step 3: '?' to '?' Matches:**\n        *   While both `left_q` and `right_q` are not empty:\n            *   Pop `idx_l` from `left_q`.\n            *   Pop `idx_r` from `right_q`.\n            *   Add `(idx_l + 1, idx_r + 1)` to `pairs`.\n\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   Print `len(pairs)`.\n    *   For each `(l_idx, r_idx)` in `pairs`, print `l_idx r_idx`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N). Each boot index is added to a list once and popped from a list once. The loops iterate 26 times for specific colors, but the `while` loops inside process each boot at most once across all iterations. String processing and output are also O(N).\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(N). The lists storing boot indices (`left_specific_colors`, `right_specific_colors`, `left_q`, `right_q`) and the `pairs` list will store at most `N` elements each.\n\nThis greedy approach is optimal because it prioritizes the most constrained matches, ensuring that the flexible '?' boots are used to fill gaps that cannot be satisfied by more specific matches.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read n, the number of boots for each leg\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Read the strings representing colors of left and right boots\n    l_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Data structures to store 0-indexed positions of boots by their color.\n    # We use lists of lists for specific colors ('a' through 'z')\n    # and separate lists for question marks ('?').\n    # Each inner list will store indices of available boots of that specific color.\n    left_specific_colors = [[] for _ in range(26)] # For 'a' (index 0) to 'z' (index 25)\n    right_specific_colors = [[] for _ in range(26)]\n    left_q = [] # Stores indices of left boots with '?' color\n    right_q = [] # Stores indices of right boots with '?' color\n\n    # Populate the data structures based on input strings\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l_str[i] == '?':\n            left_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            # Convert character to an integer index (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.)\n            left_specific_colors[ord(l_str[i]) - ord('a')].append(i)\n        \n        if r_str[i] == '?':\n            right_q.append(i)\n        else:\n            right_specific_colors[ord(r_str[i]) - ord('a')].append(i)\n\n    # List to store the resulting compatible pairs (1-indexed)\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Strategy: Prioritize matches from most restrictive to least restrictive.\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors with exact specific colors (e.g., 'a' with 'a').\n    # These are the most constrained matches, so we process them first.\n    for i in range(26): # Iterate through all possible specific colors ('a' to 'z')\n        # While there are available left boots and right boots of the current specific color\n        while left_specific_colors[i] and right_specific_colors[i]:\n            idx_l = left_specific_colors[i].pop() # Get an available left boot\n            idx_r = right_specific_colors[i].pop() # Get an available right boot\n            # Store 1-indexed boot positions in the pairs list\n            pairs.append((idx_l + 1, idx_r + 1)) \n\n    # Step 2: Match specific colors with '?'
