    "thought": "**Thinking Through Lexicographical Minimization with Swaps**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a string and a specific set of allowed swaps: '0' and '1' adjacent, and '1' and '2' adjacent.  My goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string achievable through these swaps. Immediately, I start visualizing the implications of these rules.\n\nThe core realization here is that '1's act as \"mediators.\" A '0' can effectively pass through any contiguous group of '1's to its left or right. The same applies to '2's.  But, crucially, '0's and '2's *cannot* directly swap.  This means their relative ordering is key. If a '0' appears before a '2' in the original string, it *must* stay before that '2' in the final string, and vice versa. That is the critical insight, and is the key to minimizing the string.\n\nSo, I need to focus on this invariant order of '0's and '2's.  I can think of it like this: I can rearrange '0's and '1's freely among themselves, and I can rearrange '1's and '2's freely among themselves. But the relative positions of '0's and '2's are locked in place. I can imagine three \"buckets\": a '0' bucket, a '1' bucket, and a '2' bucket.\n\nThe problem, then, becomes one of where to place these buckets to get the smallest string.  Clearly, I want as many '0's as possible at the beginning, followed by as many '1's as possible, and finally, the '2's.  I already know their relative order.\n\nEssentially, I need to find the number of zeros, ones, and twos, and then I can construct the smallest string from there, based on the relative positions from the beginning string. The invariant of a '0' before a '2' dictates the final order of characters.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string obtainable by swapping adjacent '0' and '1' characters, or adjacent '1' and '2' characters. We cannot swap '0' and '2' characters directly.\n\nLet's analyze the allowed swaps:\n1. '0' <-> '1': A '0' can move past a '1' (and vice versa).\n2. '1' <-> '2': A '1' can move past a '2' (and vice versa).\n\nThe crucial observation is that '0's and '2's cannot swap directly. This implies that the relative order of '0's and '2's is invariant. For example, if we have \"0...2\" in the original string, the '0' must always appear before the '2' in any reachable string. Similarly, if we have \"2...0\", the '2' must always appear before the '0'.\n\n'1's act as \"mediators\". A '0' can move past any '1' to its left or right. A '2' can move past any '1' to its left or right. This means '1's can essentially move freely past '0's and '2's.\n\nConsider the characters '0', '1', '2'. To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we want to place '0's as far left as possible, then '1's, then '2's.\n\nAll '0's can be moved to the left past any '1's. For example, \"10\" -> \"01\", \"110\" -> \"101\" -> \"011\".\nAll '2's can be moved to the right past any '1's. For example, \"21\" -> \"12\", \"211\" -> \"121\" -> \"112\".\n\nThis implies that all '0's can be grouped together, and all '2's can be grouped together, and all '1's can be grouped together. The only constraint is the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nIf there are no '1's in the string, then no swaps are possible, and the string remains unchanged. This is consistent with our logic: the '0's and '2's cannot change their relative order, and there are no '1's to mediate any movement.\n\nIf there are '1's, we can use them to arrange '0's and '2's.\nSince '0's cannot move past '2's, any '0' must stay to the left of any '2' that was originally to its right.\nSimilarly, any '2' must stay to the right of any '0' that was originally to its left.\nThis means the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed.\n\nLet's count the number of '1's in the string. Let this be `count_ones`.\nAll '0's can be moved to the left of all '1's.\nAll '2's can be moved to the right of all '1's.\n\nConsider the characters that are not '1's. Let's call them '0's and '2's. Their relative order is fixed.\nFor example, if the string is \"010210\":\nNon-'1' characters are \"0020\". Their relative order must be preserved.\nAll '1's can be moved past '0's and '2's.\nTo make the string lexicographically smallest:\n1. We want to place all '0's that are not blocked by '2's at the very beginning.\n2. Then, we want to place all '1's.\n3. Finally, place all '2's, and any '0's that were blocked by '2's.\n\nLet's extract all '0's and '2's from the original string, maintaining their relative order. Let this sequence be `non_ones_chars`.\nFor example, if `s = \"100210\"`, `non_ones_chars = \"0020\"`.\nThe number of '1's is `count_ones = 2`.\n\nAll `count_ones` '1's can be grouped together. Where should this group of '1's be placed in relation to `non_ones_chars` to make the result lexicographically smallest?\nThe '1's can effectively \"pass through\" any '0' or '2'.\nThis means we can place all '0's that appear before *any* '2' in `non_ones_chars` at the beginning of the string.\nThen, all the '1's.\nThen, all the '2's, followed by any '0's that appeared after a '2' in `non_ones_chars`.\n\nLet's find the first occurrence of '2' in the original string `s`.\n- If there is no '2' in `s`: All characters are '0's and '1's. All '0's can move past '1's. So, we can move all '0's to the left of all '1's. The result will be `N0` zeros followed by `N1` ones.\n- If there is at least one '2' in `s`:\n    - All '0's that appear *before* the first '2' in the original string can be moved to the very beginning.\n    - All '1's can be grouped together and placed after these initial '0's.\n    - All '2's (and any '0's that were after the first '2' in the original string) will then follow. Since the relative order of '0's and '2's is fixed, the remaining '0's and '2's will appear in their original relative order.\n\nLet's refine this:\n1. Count the total number of '1's in the string (`count_ones`).\n2. Construct a new string `result` by iterating through the original string `s`.\n   - If `s[i]` is '0', append '0' to `result`.\n   - If `s[i]` is '2', append '2' to `result`.\n   - If `s[i]` is '1', ignore it for now.\n\nNow `result` contains all '0's and '2's in their original relative order.\nWe need to insert `count_ones` '1's into `result` to make the final string lexicographically smallest.\nTo achieve this, we should insert all '1's at the earliest possible position where they won't be followed by a '0' that could have been placed before them.\nThis position is after all initial '0's and before the first '2'.\nSpecifically, find the first '2' in `result`. If no '2' exists, append all '1's at the end of `result`.\nIf a '2' exists, insert all `count_ones` '1's just before the first '2' in `result`.\n\nExample: `s = \"100210\"`\n1. `count_ones = 2` (from `s[0]` and `s[4]`).\n2. `result` (containing only '0's and '2's in order):\n   - `s[1] = '0'` -> `result = \"0\"`\n   - `s[2] = '0'` -> `result = \"00\"`\n   - `s[3] = '2'` -> `result = \"002\"`\n   - `s[5] = '0'` -> `result = \"0020\"`\n   So, `result = \"0020\"`.\n3. Find the first '2' in `result`. It's at index 2 (`result[2]`).\n4. Insert `count_ones` ('1's) at this position: `result[:2] + \"1\"*count_ones + result[2:]`\n   `\"00\" + \"11\" + \"20\"` = `\"001120\"`. This matches the example output.\n\nExample: `s = \"11222121\"`\n1. `count_ones = 4`.\n2. `result` (containing only '0's and '2's):\n   - `s[2] = '2'` -> `result = \"2\"`\n   - `s[3] = '2'` -> `result = \"22\"`\n   - `s[4] = '2'` -> `result = \"222\"`\n   So, `result = \"222\"`.\n3. First '2' in `result` is at index 0.\n4. Insert `count_ones` ('1's) at this position: `result[:0] + \"1\"*count_ones + result[0:]`\n   `\"\" + \"1111\" + \"222\"` = `\"1111222\"`. This matches the example output.\n\nExample: `s = \"20\"`\n1. `count_ones = 0`.\n2. `result` (containing only '0's and '2's):\n   - `s[0] = '2'` -> `result = \"2\"`\n   - `s[1] = '0'` -> `result = \"20\"`\n   So, `result = \"20\"`.\n3. First '2' in `result` is at index 0.\n4. Insert `count_ones` (0 '1's) at this position: `result[:0] + \"1\"*0 + result[0:]`\n   `\"\" + \"\" + \"20\"` = `\"20\"`. This matches the example output.\n\nThis algorithm seems correct. It places all '0's that are not constrained by '2's at the beginning, then all '1's, and then the remaining '2's (and '0's whose relative order with '2's must be preserved).\n\nImplementation details:\n- Iterate through the input string `s`.\n- Count '1's.\n- Build a list or string of non-'1' characters.\n- Find the index of the first '2' in the non-'1' characters list/string.\n- Construct the final string by concatenating: (prefix of non-'1's before the first '2') + (all '1's) + (suffix of non-'1's from the first '2' onwards).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_ones = 0\n    non_ones_chars = [] # To store '0's and '2's in their original relative order\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            count_ones += 1\n        else:\n            non_ones_chars.append(char)\n\n    # Convert the list of non-one chars back to a string for easier manipulation\n    non_ones_str = \"\".join(non_ones_chars)\n\n    # Find the position to insert the '1's\n    # All '1's should be placed after all '0's that come before any '2'\n    # and before the first '2'.\n    insert_pos = -1\n    for i in range(len(non_ones_str)):\n        if non_ones_str[i] == '2':\n            insert_pos = i\n            break\n    \n    # If no '2' is found, insert all '1's at the end\n    if insert_pos == -1:\n        result = non_ones_str + '1' * count_ones\n    else:\n        # Insert '1's at the found position\n        result = non_ones_str[:insert_pos] + '1' * count_ones + non_ones_str[insert_pos:]\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(result + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
