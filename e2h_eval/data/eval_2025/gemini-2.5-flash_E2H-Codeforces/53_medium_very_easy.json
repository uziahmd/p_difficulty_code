Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI need to write a Python script that determines the length of the longest repeating substring within a given string. The string consists of lowercase letters and has a maximum length of 100. Overlapping occurrences are valid.\n\nFirst, I'll need to develop an algorithm. I should start by considering possible substring lengths. The longest possible substring length is one less than the entire string length. For instance, if the string is \"abc\", a substring of length 3 can only appear once in a string of length 3. If a string has length *N*, the maximum repeating substring length can be *N-1*. The shortest length would be 1.  I should iterate through lengths from *N-1* down to 1. For each length, I need to generate every possible substring of that specific length. Then, I'll count how many times each substring appears within the original string to check whether it appears at least twice.\n\nThe string's length being at most 100 means a brute-force approach is acceptable. The algorithm can initialize a `max_len` to 0.\n\nNow, let's turn this logic into steps.\n\n1.  Initialize `max_len = 0`.\n2.  Iterate through all possible substring lengths `L` in descending order from `N-1` to 1.\n    a. Iterate through all possible starting positions `i` for substrings of length `L`. Specifically, loop from `0` to `N - L`.\n        i. Extract the substring `sub = S[i : i+L]`.\n        ii. Count the occurrences of `sub` in the original string `S`. To do this, I will also have to iterate through the string again using another `j` to check for match\n        iii. If a substring `sub` appears at least twice, update and return `L` since we're iterating in descending order\n3.  If no repeating substrings are found after checking every length, return `0`.\n\nNow, time to try an example to trace this with the algorithm. Let's start with \"ababa\", string length `N=5`.\n\n*   Try `L = 4`: No matching substring is found with starting indexes from 0.\n*   Try `L = 3`: \"aba\" is found in the starting position 0 and 2. So the loop terminates and we have found the answer. Return 3.\n*   Another example: With \"zzz\" as input, and length `N=3`.\n    *   `L = 2`: \"zz\" appears at index 0 and 1, so the algorithm returns 2.\n\n*   Another example: With \"abcd\".\n    *   For `L = 3`, there are no repeating substrings.\n    *   For `L = 2`, starting substrings are \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\". No repeating.\n    *   For `L = 1`, single characters don't repeat either. Return 0.\n\nNow, let's analyze the time complexity. The outermost loop iterates `N-1` times. The middle loop does it at most `N` times. The innermost `count` loop iterates `N` times as well. So, the complexity becomes `O(N * N * N) = O(N^3)`. Given `N<=100`, this should be sufficient. I can consider optimizations such as using `string.count()`, which itself should also take `O(N*L)` or similar time, but in worst case is also `O(N^2)`. Given the string length constraint `N<=100` that should be sufficient for the context.\n\nLet's rethink the counting. I don't need the exact count; I just need to know if a substring appears at least twice. We can skip the complete iteration by using a \"first found\" approach. I can find the index of the first occurrence. Then, start searching from that position + 1 to see if there is any other match. Python's `find` method comes in handy here and returns -1 if not found.\n\nHere's an optimized version:\n\n1.  Initialize `max_len = 0`\n2.  Iterate `L` in reverse from `N - 1` to `1`\n    a. Iterate `i` from `0` to `N - L`:\n        i. `sub = S[i : i+L]`.\n        ii. Use `S.find(sub, i + 1)`: find an occurrence starting at `i+1`.\n        iii. If the result of find is not `-1`: it has found at least one match, return `L`.\n\nThe improved count method",
