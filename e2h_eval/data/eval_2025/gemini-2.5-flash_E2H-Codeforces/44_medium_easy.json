He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Maximizing Profit in Polycarp's Practice**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of this \"Polycarp's Practice\" problem. I need a Python solution to maximize the total profit, which is essentially the sum of the maximum difficulties for each day.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n*   I've got `n` problems to solve across `k` days.\n*   The problems have difficulties `a_1` to `a_n`, solved in order.\n*   Each day, Polycarp tackles a *contiguous* set of problems.\n*   All `n` problems *must* be solved within the `k` days.\n*   A day's profit is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day.\n*   Total profit is the sum of daily profits.\n*   The goal: Get the biggest total profit and figure out how many problems (`t_1, t_2, ..., t_k`) to solve each day.\n\n**Key Insight:**\n\nThe strategy is to make sure the `k` largest values in the array `a` determine the profit on each day. If I can, that guarantees the maximum total profit.\n\n**Constructing the Solution:**\n\n1.  **Find the `k` largest**: I sort the array to identify the `k` largest problems.\n2.  **Determine Split Points**: Since the largest values need to be the \"maximum\" for some day, the key is the split points. To do this, I need to get the indices of these `k` largest values.\n3.  **Optimal Splitting**: I realized a simple split strategy won't work. The important thing is that the `k` problems which are the largest, `V_i` (at indices `idx_i`), must be the maximum value in *some* segment.\n    -   I sort the indices of these `k` largest values (`idx_1` to `idx_k`). Let's say the sorted indices are `p'_1, p'_2, ..., p'_k`.\n    -   I create `k` segments. Each segment has one of the `k` largest values, and this values must be the maximum for that segment.\n    -   Here's where it clicks: the maximum profit is achieved by starting a new day at index `p'_{j-1}+1`. In other words, I want to make sure that for these `k` largest values, I make their index the last index of a segment.\n4.  **Calculate Segment Lengths**: With the split indices `p'_1 < p'_2 < ... < p'_k`, the day length (`t_1, ..., t_k`) is determined as follows:\n    *   Day 1: problems `0` to `p'_1`. This means segment length `t_1 = p'_1 + 1`.\n    *   Day j: problems `p'_{j-2}+1` to `p'_{j-1}`. This means segment length `t_j = p'_{j-1} - p'_{j-2}`\n    *   Day k: problems `p'_{k-1}+1` to `n-1`. This means segment length `t_k = n - 1 - p'_{k-1}`\n\nSo, I need to write a Python code to make this happen. I'll need to handle the sorting and splitting correctly to ensure I generate those `t` values.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to divide `n` problems, given as a list of difficulties `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, into exactly `k` contiguous segments. Each segment corresponds to problems solved on one day. The profit for a day is the maximum difficulty among problems solved on that day. We want to maximize the total profit (sum of daily profits) and output the maximum profit and the lengths of the `k` segments.\n\n**Key Insight for Maximum Total Profit:**\nTo maximize the sum of `k` maximums, we should choose the `k` largest values from the entire list of problem difficulties `a`. Let these `k` largest values be `V_1, V_2, ..., V_k`. The maximum possible total profit will be `sum(V_i)`. This is because each chosen `V_i` must be the maximum of some segment, and no segment's maximum can exceed one of these `V_i` values (if `V_i` are truly the `k` largest values overall).\n\n**Constructing the Segments:**\n1.  **Identify the `k` largest problems:**\n    Create a list of `(value, index)` pairs for all problems. Sort this list in descending order based on `value`. Take the first `k` pairs. These are our `k` problems that will contribute to the maximum total profit.\n    For example, if `a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]` and `k = 3`:\n    Pairs: `[(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n    Sorted by value: `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n    Top `k=3` problems: `(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)`.\n    The maximum total profit is `9 + 6 + 5 = 20`.\n\n2.  **Extract and sort their original indices:**\n    The original indices of these `k` problems are `6, 3, 0`.\n    Sort these indices in ascending order: `p_0 = 0, p_1 = 3, p_2 = 6`. These are the indices of the problems that *must* be included in distinct segments and serve as the maximums for those segments.\n\n3.  **Determine segment lengths `t_1, ..., t_k`:**\n    We need to make `k-1` cuts to divide the `n` problems into `k` segments. To ensure each `p_j` is the maximum of its segment, and to simplify the segment construction, we can place the `k-1` cuts *after* the problems at indices `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-2}`.\n    \n    Let `p` be the sorted list of `k` indices: `[p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-1}]`.\n    \n    The segments will be:\n    *   Day 1: Problems from index `0` to `p_0`. Length `t_1 = p_0 + 1`.\n    *   Day 2: Problems from index `p_0 + 1` to `p_1`. Length `t_2 = p_1 - p_0`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Day `j` (for `j` from `2` to `k-1`): Problems from index `p_{j-2} + 1` to `p_{j-1}`. Length `t_j = p_{j-1} - p_{j-2}`.\n    *   Day `k`: Problems from index `p_{k-1} + 1` to `n-1`. Length `t_k = (n-1) - (p_{k-1} + 1) + 1 = n - 1 - p_{k-1}`.\n\n    Let's verify this strategy with the example `n=8, k=3`, `p = [0, 3, 6]`:\n    *   `t_1 = p_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. (Problems `a[0]`)\n    *   `t_2 = p_1 - p_0 = 3 - 0 = 3`. (Problems `a[1]` to `a[3]`)\n    *   `t_3 = n - 1 - p_2 = 8 - 1 - 6 = 1`. (Problems `a[7]`)\n    \n    The lengths are `[1, 3, 1]`. The sum is `1+3+1 = 5`, which is not `n=8`. This strategy is incorrect.\n\n    **Correct Strategy for Segment Lengths:**\n    The issue is that the `k` problems identified (`p_0, ..., p_{k-1}`) are the ones that give the maximum profit. We need to make `k-1` cuts *between* these `k` problems.\n    \n    The `k-1` cut points will be after index `p_0`, after index `p_1`, ..., after index `p_{k-2}`.\n    \n    Let's track the `current_start_index` for each day.\n    *   `current_start_index = 0`\n    *   For `j` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        The `j`-th segment (0-indexed) ends at `p_j`.\n        Length `t_{j+1} = p_j - current_start_index + 1`.\n        `current_start_index = p_j + 1`.\n    *   The last segment (Day `k`) starts at `p_{k-1} + 1` and ends at `n-1`.\n        Length `t_k = n - current_start_index`. (Or `n - (p_{k-1} + 1)` problems from `p_{k-1}+1` to `n-1`, plus `p_{k-1}+1` problems before that.)\n\n    Let's use a simpler approach for segment lengths:\n    We have `k-1` split points. These split points must be chosen from the `k-1` smallest indices among `p_0, ..., p_{k-1}`.\n    Let `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-1}` be the sorted indices of the chosen `k` problems.\n    The `k-1` split points will be `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-2}`.\n    \n    The lengths array `t` will be constructed as follows:\n    `t = []`\n    `last_split_idx = -1` (represents the index just before the first problem, i.e., start of the list)\n    For `i` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        `t.append(p_i - last_split_idx)`\n        `last_split_idx = p_i`\n    Finally, the last segment takes all remaining problems:\n    `t.append(n - 1 - last_split_idx)` (This is the number of problems from `last_split_idx + 1` to `n-1`).\n\n    Let's re-trace `n=8, k=3`, `p = [0, 3, 6]`:\n    `last_split_idx = -1`\n    `i = 0`: `p_0 = 0`. `t.append(0 - (-1)) = 1`. `t = [1]`. `last_split_idx = 0`.\n    `i = 1`: `p_1 = 3`. `t.append(3 - 0) = 3`. `t = [1, 3]`. `last_split_idx = 3`.\n    Loop ends (since `i` goes up to `k-2 = 1`).\n    Last segment: `t.append(n - 1 - last_split_idx) = 8 - 1 - 3 = 4`. `t = [1, 3, 4]`.\n    Sum of `t`: `1 + 3 + 4 = 8`. This is `n`.\n    This set of lengths `[1, 3, 4]` produces the maximum profit `20` and sums to `n`.\n    This matches one of the valid outputs.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1.  Read `n` and `k`.\n2.  Read the array `a`.\n3.  Create a list of tuples `(value, original_index)` for each problem.\n    `problems_with_indices = [(a[i], i) for i in range(n)]`\n4.  Sort `problems_with_indices` in descending order based on `value`.\n5.  Take the first `k` elements from the sorted list. These are the `k` problems with the highest difficulties.\n    `top_k_problems = problems_with_indices[:k]`\n6.  Calculate the maximum total profit by summing the difficulties of these `top_k_problems`.\n    `max_total_profit = sum(p[0] for p in top_k_problems)`\n7.  Extract the original indices of these `top_k_problems` and sort them in ascending order.\n    `split_indices = sorted([p[1] for p in top_k_problems])`\n8.  Calculate the lengths of the `k` segments:\n    `segment_lengths = []`\n    `current_start_index = 0`\n    For `i` from `0` to `k-2`:\n        The `i`-th split point `split_indices[i]` marks the end of a segment.\n        `length = split_indices[i] - current_start_index + 1`\n        `segment_lengths.append(length)`\n        `current_start_index = split_indices[i] + 1`\n    The last segment takes all remaining problems:\n    `segment_lengths.append(n - current_start_index)`\n9.  Print `max_total_profit`.\n10. Print the `segment_lengths` separated by spaces.\n\n**Example 1 Walkthrough:**\n`n = 8, k = 3`\n`a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]`\n\n1.  `problems_with_indices = [(5,0), (4,1), (2,2), (6,3), (5,4), (1,5), (9,6), (2,7)]`\n2.  Sorted by value: `[(9,6), (6,3), (5,0), (5,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,7), (1,5)]`\n3.  `top_k_problems = [(9,6), (6,3), (5,0)]`\n4.  `max_total_profit = 9 + 6 + 5 = 20`\n5.  `split_indices = sorted([6, 3, 0]) = [0, 3, 6]`\n6.  Calculate `segment_lengths`:\n    `segment_lengths = []`\n    `current_start_index = 0`\n    `i = 0`: `split_indices[0] = 0`. `length = 0 - 0 + 1 = 1`. `segment_lengths = [1]`. `current_start_index = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n    `i = 1`: `split_indices[1] = 3`. `length = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`. `segment_lengths = [1, 3]`. `current_start_index = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n    Loop ends (since `k-2 = 1`).\n    Last segment: `segment_lengths.append(n - current_start_index) = 8 - 4 = 4`. `segment_lengths = [1, 3, 4]`.\n7.  Output:\n    `20`\n    `1 3 4`\n\nThis matches the logic and produces a valid output.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Creating `problems_with_indices`: O(N)\n*   Sorting `problems_with_indices`: O(N log N)\n*   Extracting `top_k_problems` and `max_total_profit`: O(K)\n*   Sorting `split_indices`: O(K log K)\n*   Calculating `segment_lengths`: O(K)\nOverall time complexity: O(N log N) (dominated by sorting `problems_with_indices`).\nOverall space complexity: O(N) for storing `problems_with_indices`.\nGiven `N <= 2000`, `N log N` is efficient enough.
