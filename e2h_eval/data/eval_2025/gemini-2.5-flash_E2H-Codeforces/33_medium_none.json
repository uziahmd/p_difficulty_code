You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value.

The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements.

    "thought": "**Maximizing a Number by Replacing Digits**\n\nMy goal is to write a Python script to solve a competitive programming problem where I'm given a number 'a' (represented as a string of digits) and a set of available digits 's' (also a string). I can replace any digit in 'a' with a digit from 's', but each digit in 's' can only be used once. The aim is to maximize the resulting value of 'a'.\n\nThe key insight is that to maximize a number, the most significant digits (leftmost digits) should be as large as possible. This is a greedy problem where I want to make the best local decisions at each step to reach the global optimum.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Sort 's'**: I'll sort 's' in descending order so that I can easily pick the largest available digit when needed.\n2.  **Iterate through 'a'**: I'll go through 'a' from left to right. For each digit in 'a', I'll compare it with the largest remaining digit from 's'.\n3.  **Greedy Replacement**: If the largest available digit from 's' is greater than the current digit in 'a', I'll replace it. This is a sound greedy choice because putting a larger digit at a more significant position always results in a larger number. If the largest 's' digit isn't greater than the current 'a' digit, I'll leave it as is. I have to be careful with the logic for this situation: if I can't improve 'a[i]' with `s[ptr]`, then I simply continue to the next position. 's' is not exhausted yet, I will be potentially reusing the current `s[ptr]` at a later index of `a`, if appropriate.\n\nThe algorithm in detail:\n\n1.  Read 'a' and 's' as strings.\n2.  Sort the characters in 's' in descending order and store as list or string for easy access.\n3.  Convert 'a' into a modifiable list.\n4.  Initialize a pointer (s\\_ptr) to the start of the sorted 's'.\n5.  Iterate through 'a':\n    *   If 's' still has available digits:\n        *   If the current largest digit in 's' is greater than the current digit in 'a', replace it.  Move `s_ptr`.\n        *   Otherwise, move to the next digit in 'a'.\n6.  Return the modified 'a' as a string.\n\nI've carefully considered edge cases such as empty input, only zeros, and length-1 inputs. The optimized solution has a time complexity of O(M log M + N), where N is the length of 'a' and M is the length of 's' (sorting dominates the complexity).\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to maximize the value of an integer `a` by replacing some of its digits with digits from a sequence `s`. Each digit from `s` can be used at most once.\n\nTo maximize a number, we want its most significant digits (leftmost digits) to be as large as possible. This suggests a greedy approach: iterate through the digits of `a` from left to right, and for each digit, try to replace it with the largest possible digit from `s` if it results in an improvement.\n\nHere's the detailed strategy:\n\n1.  **Prepare `a` and `s`**:\n    *   Convert the input string `a` into a list of characters (`a_chars`) so its digits can be modified.\n    *   Convert the input string `s` into a list of characters and sort it in descending order (`s_chars`). This allows us to easily pick the largest available digit from `s` by always looking at `s_chars[0]` (or `s_chars[s_ptr]` if `s_ptr` is used as an index).\n\n2.  **Iterate and Replace**:\n    *   Initialize a pointer `s_ptr = 0` to keep track of the largest available digit in `s_chars`.\n    *   Iterate through `a_chars` from index `i = 0` to `len(a_chars) - 1`.\n    *   Inside the loop, at each position `i`:\n        *   **Check `s` availability**: If `s_ptr` has reached the end of `s_chars` (meaning all digits from `s` have been considered), we cannot make any more replacements, so we break the loop.\n        *   **Compare and Replace**: Compare the current digit `a_chars[i]` with the largest available digit from `s`, which is `s_chars[s_ptr]`.\n            *   If `s_chars[s_ptr]` is strictly greater than `a_chars[i]`: This is an opportunity to make `a` larger at its most significant possible position. Replace `a_chars[i]` with `s_chars[s_ptr]`. Then, increment `s_ptr` to mark this digit from `s` as used, and move to the next largest available `s` digit for subsequent comparisons.\n            *   If `s_chars[s_ptr]` is not greater than `a_chars[i]` (i.e., `s_chars[s_ptr] <= a_chars[i]`): We cannot improve `a_chars[i]` with the current largest `s` digit. We leave `a_chars[i]` as it is. We *do not* increment `s_ptr` because `s_chars[s_ptr]` is still available and might be able to improve a less significant digit `a_chars[j]` where `j > i` (if `a_chars[j]` is smaller than `s_chars[s_ptr]`). We simply move to the next position `i+1` in `a_chars`.\n\n3.  **Output**: After the loop finishes, join the characters in `a_chars` back into a string and print it.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`a = \"1024\"`, `s = \"010\"`):**\n\n1.  `a_chars = ['1', '0', '2', '4']`\n2.  `s_chars = ['1', '0', '0']` (sorted `s` in descending order)\n3.  `s_ptr = 0`\n\n*   **i = 0 (`a_chars[0] = '1'`)**:\n    *   `s_chars[0] = '1'`. `'1'` is not greater than `'1'`.\n    *   `a_chars` remains `['1', '0', '2', '4']`. `s_ptr` remains `0`.\n*   **i = 1 (`a_chars[1] = '0'`)**:\n    *   `s_chars[0] = '1'`. `'1'` is greater than `'0'`.\n    *   Replace `a_chars[1]` with `'1'`. `a_chars` becomes `['1', '1', '2', '4']`.\n    *   Increment `s_ptr` to `1`.\n*   **i = 2 (`a_chars[2] = '2'`)**:\n    *   `s_chars[1] = '0'`. `'0'` is not greater than `'2'`.\n    *   `a_chars` remains `['1', '1', '2', '4']`. `s_ptr` remains `1`.\n*   **i = 3 (`a_chars[3] = '4'`)**:\n    *   `s_chars[1] = '0'`. `'0'` is not greater than `'4'`.\n    *   `a_chars` remains `['1', '1', '2', '4']`. `s_ptr` remains `1`.\n\nLoop ends. Result: `\"1124\"`.\n\n**Complexity:**\n*   Sorting `s`: `O(M log M)` where `M` is the length of `s`.\n*   Iterating through `a`: `O(N)` where `N` is the length of `a`.
