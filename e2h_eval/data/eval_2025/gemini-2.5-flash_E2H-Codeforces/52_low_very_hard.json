Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through the New Year Candles Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this \"New Year Candles\" problem. The core of it is a pretty classic simulation scenario.  Vasily starts with some candles, *a*, and can make new ones from burnt-out ones, *b* to 1.  The question is: how many total hours can he have light?  Essentially, how many candles can he burn in total?\n\nMy approach is a straightforward simulation. I'll need to keep track of a few key things: the `total_hours` (which is the same as the total candles burnt), the number of `current_new_candles` Vasily has at any given time, and the pile of `burnt_out_candles` he's accumulating.\n\nThe simulation will work like this:\n\n1.  **Initialization:**  Start with `total_hours = 0`, `current_new_candles = a`, and `burnt_out_candles = 0`.\n2.  **The Loop:**  As long as Vasily has candles to burn (`current_new_candles > 0`), I'll do the following:\n    *   **Burn Candles:**  Burn all the `current_new_candles`.  This adds to the `total_hours` and also increases `burnt_out_candles`.\n    *   **Craft New Candles:**  Figure out how many new candles he can make from his `burnt_out_candles` (integer division `//` is key here).  Any leftover burnt candles become the remainder (`%`).\n    *   **Update `current_new_candles`:**  The newly crafted candles become the `current_new_candles` for the next round.\n\nFinally, after the loop finishes (when `current_new_candles` reaches 0), the `total_hours` will be my answer.\n\nTo make sure this logic is clear, I'll walk through a small example (e.g., *a* = 4, *b* = 2). This will cement the iterative process and ensure my script will produce the intended results.  The key is to model this as a discrete series of states to determine the final state.\n",
