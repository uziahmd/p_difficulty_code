Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Flawed Flow: My Strategy for Direction**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this \"Flawed Flow\" problem, and the goal is to direct the edges of a flow network to satisfy a few conditions: flow conservation, no cycles, and implicitly, maximum flow. The input is clear: `n` vertices, `m` edges, with flow capacities `ci` for each edge `(ai, bi)`. I need to output the direction of each edge, represented by `di` (0 or 1).\n\nMy initial analysis focused on the key constraints. Firstly, flow conservation is crucial. For any vertex *except* the source (1) and sink (n), the total flow entering must equal the total flow exiting. The source has no incoming flow, and in a standard max flow setting, all flow eventually exits from the sink.  The edges connecting to the source are critical; they *must* point away from it, which makes sense. No cycles means I'm aiming for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Finding a topological sort could be a powerful way to enforce this.\n\nThe \"no cycles\" condition is the big one. If I can figure out a way to orient the edges such that flow always travels from a lower to a higher value in a topological ordering, I'll avoid cycles. The source (vertex 1) having no incoming edges is a big hint. It sets the direction for all edges directly connected to it – they *all* have to be outgoing.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the total flow capacity at each vertex.  Let's call it `total_flow_capacity[v]`. For vertices other than 1 and n, this is the sum of the capacities of all edges connected to `v`. Flow conservation forces `total_flow_capacity[v]` to be an *even* number, and half of this value is the inflow and the other half is the outflow. This is a very useful property to check during the process. I believe that total capacity *should* be an even value to be able to use the total incoming flow vs outgoing flow concept on any arbitrary node.\n",
