You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Thinking Through \"Replacing Digits\"**\n\nOkay, so I've got this \"Replacing Digits\" problem. The input is a number `a` and a set of replacement digits `s`, both strings. The goal is to maximize the value of `a` by replacing digits with those from `s`, using each digit in `s` at most once.\n\nMy immediate thought is, to maximize a number, I need the leftmost digits to be as large as possible.  That screams \"greedy approach\" to me.\n\n**Greedy Algorithm Design**\n\nI'm thinking of iterating through the digits of `a` from left to right. For each digit in `a`, I want to find the largest digit in `s` that's *greater* than the current digit in `a`. If I find one, I'll make the swap and remove that digit from my available set, `s`.  If I don't find a larger digit, I just move on.\n\nLet's make this concrete.  I'll convert `a` into a list so I can modify it.  For `s`, sorting is the key.  If I sort `s` in *ascending* order, popping the last element gives me the largest available digit in each iteration. That seems efficient.\n\n**The Detailed Algorithm**\n\n1.  Read `a` and `s` as strings.\n2.  Convert `a` to a list of characters: `a_list = list(a)`.\n3.  Convert `s` to a list of characters: `s_list = list(s)`.\n4.  Sort `s_list` in ascending order: `s_list.sort()`.\n5.  Iterate through the digits of `a`:\n    *   Get the current digit from `a`.\n    *   Check if I still have digits in `s`.\n    *   If I do, get the largest available digit from `s` (using the sorted list).\n    *   Compare the digits.  If the digit from `s` is bigger, make the replacement in `a` and remove that digit from `s`.\n    *   If the `s` digit is not greater, I won't use it, as it's not improving anything and using a smaller one isn't worth it.\n\nThat should do it. Now, let's turn this thought process into some code!\n",
