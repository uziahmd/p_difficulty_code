Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "**Reflecting on the Angle Problem**\n\nAlright, so the user wants me to cook up a Python script that can pinpoint three vertices (v1, v2, v3) on a regular n-sided polygon, making the angle at v2 as close as possible to a given angle 'a'.  The key here, as an expert, is to use the geometry of the polygon and the properties of inscribed angles and circumcircles.\n\nI'll start by reminding myself that all the vertices of the polygon lie on the circumcircle. An angle formed by these vertices, like v1-v2-v3, where v2 is the \"vertex\" of the angle, is an inscribed angle. And the measure of this inscribed angle is exactly half the measure of the central angle that \"cuts out\" the same arc on the circle.\n\nLet's number the vertices, say, 0 through n-1. I figure, without losing any generality, I can fix one of these vertices, let's say vertex i, to be v2. Then v1 and v3 become variables. The angle, then, is a function of the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc *not* containing v2. More precisely, if m is the \"number of edges\" between v1 and v3 (when traveling around the arc *not* containing v2), then the angle at v2 is m * (180/n).\n\nNow the goal is to find an *integer* 'm' between 1 and n-2 (since the vertices must be distinct) that makes this angle as close as possible to the target angle 'a'.  Let `base_angle = 180.0/n`, so the desired angle is `k * base_angle`.  So then `k * base_angle ~ a`, and `k ~ a * n / 180`, where 'k' must be between 1 and n-2.\n\nThe idea is to find the integer `k` in the range 1 to n-2 that minimizes the absolute difference between `k * base_angle` and the target angle 'a'.  I calculate a float `k_float = a * n / 180.0` and take its floor and ceiling.  I then clamp those results into the 1 to n-2 range and check which of them gives a smaller absolute difference with a.\n\nOnce I have this \"best\" `k`, picking the vertices is straightforward. I can choose v2 as vertex '1'. Then I choose `v1 = 2` and `v3` to be a vertex `k + 2` positions away from the vertex `v2 = 1` in one direction and ensuring `v1`, `v2`, `v3` are all distinct.\n\nThis method gives me a deterministic and fairly performant way to solve the problem for a given regular polygon.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` of a regular convex `n`-gon such that the angle `v1-v2-v3` (with `v2` as the vertex of the angle) is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. We need to output these three vertices, numbered from 1 to `n` in clockwise order.\n\n**Understanding Angles in a Regular Polygon**\n\n1.  **Circumcircle:** All vertices of a regular `n`-gon lie on a circumcircle.\n2.  **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An angle formed by three vertices of the polygon (`v1-v2-v3`) is an inscribed angle in this circumcircle. Its measure is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. The arc subtended by `v1-v2-v3` is the arc `v1-v3` that does not contain `v2`.\n3.  **Elementary Angle:** In a regular `n`-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees. The inscribed angle subtended by an arc connecting two adjacent vertices (i.e., an arc spanning one edge) is `(360/n) / 2 = 180/n` degrees. Let's call this `angle_unit`.\n4.  **General Angle:** If an arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) spans `k` edges of the `n`-gon, then the inscribed angle `v1-v2-v3` will be `k * angle_unit = k * (180/n)` degrees.\n5.  **Range of `k`:** Since `v1, v2, v3` must be distinct, `v1` and `v3` cannot be the same vertex, and neither can be `v2`. This means the arc `v1-v3` must span at least 1 edge (`k >= 1`). Also, `v2` must not be on the arc `v1-v3`, meaning there must be at least one vertex (namely `v2`) not on that arc. The total number of edges is `n`. If `k` edges are on one arc, then `n-k` edges are on the other arc. The arc containing `v2` must have at least one edge (if `v2` is adjacent to `v1` or `v3`) or more. So, the number of edges `k` on the arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2`) can range from `1` to `n-2`. For example, if `k=n-1`, then `v1` and `v3` would be separated by `n-1` edges, meaning `v2` would have to be `v1` or `v3`, which is not allowed. If `k=n`, then `v1` and `v3` would be the same vertex. Thus, `k` must be in the range `[1, n-2]`.\n\n**Finding the Optimal `k`**\n\nWe need to find an integer `k` in the range `[1, n-2]` such that `|k * (180/n) - a|` is minimized.\nLet `angle_unit = 180.0 / n`.\nWe want `k * angle_unit` to be as close to `a` as possible.\nThis means `k` should be as close to `a / angle_unit` as possible.\nLet `k_float = a / angle_unit = a / (180.0 / n) = (a * n) / 180.0`.\n\nThe integer values of `k` closest to `k_float` are `floor(k_float)` and `ceil(k_float)`.\nLet `k_cand1 = floor(k_float)` and `k_cand2 = ceil(k_float)`.\n\nWe must ensure that our chosen `k` is within the valid range `[1, n-2]`.\nSo, the actual candidates for `k` are:\n1.  `k_val1 = max(1, int(k_cand1))`\n2.  `k_val2 = min(n - 2, int(k_cand2))`\n\nWe calculate the difference `abs(k * angle_unit - a)` for `k_val1` and `k_val2` and choose the `k` that yields the minimum difference. If `k_val1` and `k_val2` are the same (e.g., if `k_float` is an integer, or if it's clamped to `1` or `n-2`), we only need to check that one value.\n\n**Constructing the Vertices**\n\nOnce we have the `best_k`, we need to output three distinct vertices `v1, v2, v3` that form this angle.\nA simple and consistent way to do this is to fix `v2` to be vertex `1`.\nThen we need `v1` and `v3` such that the arc `v1-v3` (not containing `v2=1`) spans `best_k` edges.\nLet's choose `v1 = 2`. This is adjacent to `v2=1`.\nTo span `best_k` edges from `v1=2`, moving clockwise, `v3` would be at index `2 + best_k`.\nSo, the vertices would be `v1=2`, `v2=1`, `v3=2+best_k`.\n\nLet's check if these vertices are distinct and valid:\n*   `v1=2`, `v2=1`, `v3=2+best_k`.\n*   `n >= 3`.\n*   `best_k` is in `[1, n-2]`.\n*   `v1=2` is distinct from `v2=1`.\n*   `v3=2+best_k` is distinct from `v2=1` because `best_k >= 1`, so `2+best_k >= 3`.\n*   `v3=2+best_k` is distinct from `v1=2` because `best_k >= 1`.\n*   `v3=2+best_k` is a valid vertex index:\n    *   Minimum `v3`: `2+1 = 3`.\n    *   Maximum `v3`: `2+(n-2) = n`.\n    All indices are within `[1, n]`.\n\nThis construction `(2, 1, 2+best_k)` always works.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Read `n` and `a`.\n2.  Calculate `angle_unit = 180.0 / n`.\n3.  Calculate `k_float = (a * n) / 180.0`.\n4.  Initialize `min_diff = float('inf')` and `best_k = -1`.\n5.  Consider `k_cand1 = int(k_float)` (floor).\n6.  Consider `k_cand2 = int(k_float + 0.9999999999)` (a way to get ceil for positive floats, or just `math.ceil(k_float)`).\n7.  Create a list of candidate `k` values: `candidates = []`.\n    *   If `1 <= k_cand1 <= n-2`, add `k_cand1` to `candidates`.\n    *   If `1 <= k_cand2 <= n-2` and `k_cand2 != k_cand1`, add `k_cand2` to `candidates`.\n    *   Edge cases: If `k_float < 1`, `k=1` is the best choice. If `k_float > n-2`, `k=n-2` is the best choice.\n    *   A more robust way for candidates:\n        `k_to_check = []`\n        `if k_cand1 >= 1 and k_cand1 <= n-2: k_to_check.append(k_cand1)`\n        `if k_cand2 >= 1 and k_cand2 <= n-2 and k_cand2 != k_cand1: k_to_check.append(k_cand2)`\n        `if not k_to_check:` (This can happen if k_float is outside [1, n-2])\n            `if k_float < 1: k_to_check.append(1)`\n            `if k_float > n-2: k_to_check.append(n-2)`\n            `if n == 3: k_to_check.append(1)` (Special case for n=3, only k=1 is possible)\n\n    A simpler way to handle candidates:\n    `k_values = []`\n    `k_low = int(k_float)`\n    `k_high = int(math.ceil(k_float))`\n\n    `if k_low >= 1 and k_low <= n-2: k_values.append(k_low)`\n    `if k_high >= 1 and k_high <= n-2 and k_high != k_low: k_values.append(k_high)`\n\n    If `k_values` is empty (meaning `k_float` is outside `[1, n-2]`), we need to clamp.\n    `if not k_values:`\n        `if k_float < 1: k_values.append(1)`\n        `else: k_values.append(n-2)`\n    \n    This ensures `k_values` always contains at least one relevant `k`.\n\n8.  Iterate through `k` in `k_values`:\n    *   `current_angle = k * angle_unit`\n    *   `current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)`\n    *   If `current_diff < min_diff`:\n        *   `min_diff = current_diff`\n        *   `best_k = k`\n9.  Print `2`, `1`, `2+best_k`.\n\n**Example Walkthrough: n=4, a=67**\n\n1.  `n=4, a=67`\n2.  `angle_unit = 180.0 / 4 = 45.0`\n3.  `k_float = (67 * 4) / 180.0 = 268.0 / 180.0 = 1.4888...`\n4.  `min_diff = inf`, `best_k = -1`\n5.  `k_low = int(1.4888...) = 1`\n6.  `k_high = int(math.ceil(1.4888...)) = 2`\n7.  `k_values = []`\n    *   `k_low = 1`: `1 >= 1` and `1 <= 4-2=2`. Add `1` to `k_values`. `k_values = [1]`.\n    *   `k_high = 2`: `2 >= 1` and `2 <= 4-2=2`. `k_high != k_low` (2 != 1). Add `2` to `k_values`. `k_values = [1, 2]`.\n8.  Iterate:\n    *   For `k=1`:\n        *   `current_angle = 1 * 45.0 = 45.0`\n        *   `current_diff = abs(45.0 - 67) = 22.0`\n        *   `22.0 < inf`. So, `min_diff = 22.0`, `best_k = 1`.\n    *   For `k=2`:\n        *   `current_angle = 2 * 45.0 = 90.0`\n        *   `current_diff = abs(90.0 - 67) = 23.0`\n        *   `23.0` is not less than `22.0`. No update.\n9.  Final `best_k = 1`. Print `2 1 (2+1) = 2 1 3`.\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    n, a = map(int, input().split())\n\n    angle_unit = 180.0 / n\n\n    # Calculate k_float, the ideal k value if it weren't restricted to integers\n    k_float = (a * n) / 180.0\n\n    # Candidate k values are floor(k_float) and ceil(k_float)\n    k_low = int(k_float)\n    k_high = int(math.ceil(k_float))\n\n    possible_k_values = []\n\n    # Check k_low\n    if 1 <= k_low <= n - 2:\n        possible_k_values.append(k_low)\n\n    # Check k_high (only if it's different from k_low and within bounds)\n    if k_high != k_low and 1 <= k_high <= n - 2:\n        possible_k_values.append(k_high)\n    \n    # Handle edge cases where k_float is outside [1, n-2]\n    # If k_float < 1, the closest valid k is 1.\n    # If k_float > n-2, the closest valid k is n-2.\n    if not possible_k_values:\n        if k_float < 1:\n            possible_k_values.append(1)\n        else: # k_float > n-2\n            possible_k_values.append(n - 2)\n    \n    # Find the best k\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = -1\n\n    for k in possible_k_values:\n        current_angle = k * angle_unit\n        current_diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n        \n        # If current_diff is strictly smaller, update best_k\n        if current_diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = current_diff\n            best_k = k\n        # If current_diff is equal, we can keep the current best_k (any optimal solution is fine)\n        # The problem statement says any optimal solution is fine, so no specific tie-breaking needed\n        # We can optionally choose the smaller k for consistency, but it's not required.\n        # if current_diff == min_diff and k < best_k:\n        #    best_k = k\n\n    # Output vertices: v1=2, v2=1, v3=2+best_k\n    # This choice ensures distinct vertices and the correct angle.\n    # v2 is vertex 1.\n    # v1 is vertex 2.\n    # v3 is vertex 2 + best_k.\n    # The arc (v1, v3) not containing v2 is (2, 2+best_k).\n    # The number of edges on this arc is (2+best_k) - 2 = best_k.\n    print(2, 1, 2 + best_k)\n\nsolve()\n\n```",
