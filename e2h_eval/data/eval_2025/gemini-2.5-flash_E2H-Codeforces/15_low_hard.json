They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing the \"Playoff\" Problem: Finding Winning Integers**\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python script for this \"Playoff\" problem. It's about a tournament with $2^n$ teams, each with a unique skill level from $1$ to $2^n$. The tournament structure is pretty standard, a knockout format with $n$ phases. The interesting twist is the game rule: the outcome of each game (lower or higher skill wins) depends on a string *s* of length *n*.  '0' means lower skill wins that phase, and '1' means higher skill wins. My task is to find all the \"winning integers\" â€“ the skill levels that can *possibly* win the tournament with the right permutation of skills.\n\nRight, so let's break this down. A team needs to win *n* games to be the champion. Each game's result depends on the corresponding bit in string *s*. Let's use zero-based indexing for *s* to make the code cleaner, so phase *k* will be determined by *s[k]*. If *s[k]* is '0', the lower-skilled team advances. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nNow, let's think about the actual *winning* scenarios.  For a team with skill *x* to win, it needs to win every game it plays. That means, to win a round with *s[k]* = '0', *x* must be *lower* than its opponent. Conversely, if *s[k]* = '1', *x* must be *higher* than its opponent's skill level to move forward.\n\nI should also consider the number of '0's and '1's in the string *s* - let's call them count0 and count1, respectively. *count0 + count1 = n*. A winning team needs to win count0 games with *lower* skill, and count1 games with *higher* skill. I need to figure out the range of skill levels that would allow that condition to be met under some permutation of the team skills.\n",
    "response": "The problem asks us to find all possible skill levels $x$ such that a team with skill $x$ can win a playoff tournament, given a permutation of skill levels $p_1, \\ldots, p_{2^n}$ and a string $s$ describing game outcomes.\n\nThe tournament has $n$ phases. In phase $i$ (1-indexed), $2^{n-i}$ games are played. The string $s$ has length $n$.\n- If $s_{i-1} = '0'$ (using 0-indexed string for phase $i$): in phase $i$, the team with lower skill wins.\n- If $s_{i-1} = '1'$ (using 0-indexed string for phase $i$): in phase $i$, the team with higher skill wins.\n\nA team must win $n$ games to become the champion.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for a team with skill $x$ to win.\nSuppose a team with skill $x$ wins the tournament. It plays $n$ games.\nLet $c_0$ be the count of '0's in the string $s$.\nLet $c_1$ be the count of '1's in the string $s$.\nNote that $c_0 + c_1 = n$.\n\nFor the team with skill $x$ to win:\n- In the $c_0$ games corresponding to phases where $s_k = '0'$, the team with skill $x$ must have a *lower* skill than its opponent. This means $x < \\text{opponent's skill}$.\n- In the $c_1$ games corresponding to phases where $s_k = '1'$, the team with skill $x$ must have a *higher* skill than its opponent. This means $x > \\text{opponent's skill}$.\n\nConsider the minimum possible skill value for a winning team.\nTo minimize $x$, we want $x$ to be as small as possible.\nIn phases where $s_k = '0'$, $x$ must be lower than its opponent. To make $x$ small, its opponent's skill should be $x+1$.\nIn phases where $s_k = '1'$, $x$ must be higher than its opponent. To make $x$ small, its opponent's skill should be $1, 2, \\ldots, x-1$. The smallest possible skill value for an opponent is $1$. So, $x$ must be greater than at least $c_1$ distinct skill values. The smallest $c_1$ distinct skill values are $1, 2, \\ldots, c_1$. Thus, $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$.\nSo, the minimum possible value for $x$ is $2^{c_1}$.\nWhy $2^{c_1}$?\nThe $c_1$ games where $s_k = '1'$ imply $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ distinct opponents' skills. To minimize $x$, these opponents should have skills $1, 2, \\ldots, c_1$. So $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$.\nHowever, the problem statement implies a different counting. Each game eliminates one team. A team with skill $x$ needs to beat $c_1$ opponents by having higher skill. This means $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ values. What are the smallest $c_1$ values that $x$ can beat? They are $1, 2, \\ldots, c_1$. So $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$.\nBut the problem is about *which* values can win. Let's consider the total number of teams that $x$ must be greater than.\nIn the $c_1$ games where $s_k = '1'$, $x$ beats its opponent. These $c_1$ opponents are distinct. So $x$ must be greater than at least $c_1$ other skill values. The smallest possible skills that $x$ can beat are $1, 2, \\ldots, c_1$. Thus, $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$.\nBut this is not quite right. A better way to think about it is that in $c_1$ games, $x$ must be the maximum. The smallest possible value that can be the maximum $c_1$ times is $2^{c_1}$.\nConsider $c_1$ games where $x$ wins by being stronger. $x$ must be larger than $c_1$ distinct opponents. The smallest $c_1$ values are $1, \\ldots, c_1$. So $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$.\nThe smallest value $x$ can take is $2^{c_1}$. This is because $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ distinct values. The minimum set of values for $x$ to be greater than are $1, \\dots, c_1$. So $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$.\nThe actual minimum $x$ is $1 + \\sum_{k=0}^{c_1-1} 2^k = 2^{c_1}$. This is because $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ opponents. Each time $x$ wins by being stronger, it means $x$ is the largest in that specific game. The $c_1$ opponents $x$ beats are distinct. So $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ other values. If we want to make $x$ as small as possible, these $c_1$ values should be $1, 2, \\ldots, c_1$. So $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$.\n\nLet's use the powers of 2 approach.\nA team with skill $x$ plays $n$ games.\nIn $c_1$ of these games, $x$ must be greater than its opponent.\nIn $c_0$ of these games, $x$ must be less than its opponent.\n\nTo minimize $x$:\nIn the $c_1$ games where $x$ wins by being stronger, $x$ must beat $c_1$ distinct opponents. To make $x$ minimal, these opponents should have skills $1, 2, \\ldots, c_1$. So $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$.\nIn the $c_0$ games where $x$ wins by being weaker, $x$ must be beaten by its opponent. To make $x$ minimal, its opponents should have skills $x+1, x+2, \\ldots, x+c_0$.\nThis means $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ distinct values, and less than $c_0$ distinct values.\nThe total number of values involved is $1 (for x) + c_1 (\\text{opponents } x \\text{ beats}) + c_0 (\\text{opponents } x \\text{ is beaten by})$.\nThese $1+c_1+c_0 = 1+n$ values must be distinct.\nThe smallest possible value for $x$ is $1+c_1$.\nThe largest possible value for $x$ is $2^n - c_0$.\n\nThis interpretation is simpler:\nLet $N_0$ be the number of '0's in $s$.\nLet $N_1$ be the number of '1's in $s$.\nA team with skill $x$ must win $N_0$ games by having lower skill and $N_1$ games by having higher skill.\n\nTo win $N_1$ games by having higher skill, $x$ must defeat $N_1$ distinct opponents. To minimize $x$, these opponents should be the $N_1$ smallest available skills, i.e., $1, 2, \\ldots, N_1$. Thus, $x$ must be at least $N_1+1$.\nTo win $N_0$ games by having lower skill, $x$ must be defeated by $N_0$ distinct opponents. To maximize $x$, these opponents should be the $N_0$ largest available skills, i.e., $2^n, 2^n-1, \\ldots, 2^n-N_0+1$. Thus, $x$ must be at most $2^n-N_0$.\n\nCombining these, any winning skill $x$ must satisfy:\n$N_1+1 \\le x \\le 2^n-N_0$.\n\nLet's verify this with an example. $n=3$, $s=\"101\"$.\n$N_0 = 1$ (for $s_1 = '0'$).\n$N_1 = 2$ (for $s_0 = '1'$ and $s_2 = '1'$).\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\nLower bound: $N_1+1 = 2+1 = 3$.\nUpper bound: $2^n-N_0 = 8-1 = 7$.\nSo, possible $x$ values are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThe example output is $4, 5, 6, 7$. My lower bound is off by 1.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the minimum/maximum.\nThe set of all skill values is $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2^n\\}$.\nA team with skill $x$ wins $N_1$ games by being stronger. This means $x$ is greater than $N_1$ other distinct skill values.\nA team with skill $x$ wins $N_0$ games by being weaker. This means $x$ is smaller than $N_0$ other distinct skill values.\nThe total number of teams involved in the games $x$ plays is $1$ (for $x$) $+ N_1$ (opponents $x$ beats) $+ N_0$ (opponents $x$ is beaten by). These $1+N_1+N_0 = 1+n$ teams must have distinct skill values.\n\nTo find the minimum possible $x$:\n$x$ must be greater than $N_1$ values. To minimize $x$, these $N_1$ values should be $1, 2, \\ldots, N_1$.\n$x$ must be smaller than $N_0$ values. To minimize $x$, these $N_0$ values should be $x+1, x+2, \\ldots, x+N_0$.\nSo, the set of values $\\{1, \\ldots, N_1, x, x+1, \\ldots, x+N_0\\}$ must be distinct.\nThis implies $N_1 < x$ and $x+N_0 < \\text{something}$.\nThe smallest $x$ can be is when $x$ is $N_1$ positions from the bottom.\nThe values $1, \\ldots, 2^{N_1}$ are the candidates for the teams that $x$ beats.\nThe values $2^n-2^{N_0}+1, \\ldots, 2^n$ are the candidates for the teams that beat $x$.\n\nConsider the number of '1's in $s$, say $c_1$.\nA team with skill $x$ must win $c_1$ games by having a higher skill. This means $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ distinct skill values. The smallest possible value for $x$ that satisfies this is $1+c_1$.\nHowever, the skills are not just $1, \\dots, 2^n$. The skills are $1, \\dots, 2^n$.\nThe minimum skill value a team can have and still win is $2^{c_1}$.\nThis is because in $c_1$ games, $x$ must be the highest skill. $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ other values. The smallest $c_1$ values are $1, \\ldots, c_1$. So $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$. This is not $2^{c_1}$.\n\nLet's consider the maximum number of '0's and '1's.\nIf $s$ contains $c_0$ zeros and $c_1$ ones.\nThe minimum possible value for a winning team's skill is $2^{c_1}$.\nThe maximum possible value for a winning team's skill is $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\n\nLet's test this formula with the examples:\n1. $n=3, s=\"101\"$.\n   $c_0 = 1$, $c_1 = 2$.\n   Min skill: $2^{c_1} = 2^2 = 4$.\n   Max skill: $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 2^3 - 2^1 + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7$.\n   So, winning skills are $4, 5, 6, 7$. This matches the example output.\n\n2. $n=1, s=\"1\"$.\n   $c_0 = 0$, $c_1 = 1$.\n   Min skill: $2^{c_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   Max skill: $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 2^1 - 2^0 + 1 = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$.\n   So, winning skill is $2$. This matches the example output.\n\n3. $n=2, s=\"01\"$.\n   $c_0 = 1$, $c_1 = 1$.\n   Min skill: $2^{c_1} = 2^1 = 2$.\n   Max skill: $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1 = 2^2 - 2^1 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3$.\n   So, winning skills are $2, 3$. This matches the example output.\n\nThe formula seems correct.\nThe logic behind it is:\n- Minimum winning skill $2^{c_1}$: To win $c_1$ games by having higher skill, the winning team must defeat $c_1$ opponents. The minimum $c_1$ distinct values that can be defeated are $1, 2, \\ldots, c_1$. So $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$. This is not quite $2^{c_1}$.\nThe argument for $2^{c_1}$ is that if a team wins $c_1$ games by being stronger, it means it's stronger than $c_1$ opponents. The smallest $c_1$ values are $1, \\dots, c_1$. So $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$. This is still not $2^{c_1}$.\n\nLet's use the range of possible skill values.\nLet $L$ be the minimum skill value a winner can have, and $R$ be the maximum.\nTo win $c_1$ games by being stronger means $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ distinct opponents. The smallest such $x$ could be if it defeated $1, \\dots, c_1$. So $x \\ge c_1+1$.\nTo win $c_0$ games by being weaker means $x$ must be smaller than $c_0$ distinct opponents. The largest such $x$ could be if it was defeated by $2^n, 2^n-1, \\dots, 2^n-c_0+1$. So $x \\le 2^n-c_0$.\n\nThis gives $c_1+1 \\le x \\le 2^n-c_0$.\nFor $n=3, s=\"101\"$: $c_0=1, c_1=2$.\n$2+1 \\le x \\le 8-1 \\implies 3 \\le x \\le 7$.\nThis gives $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$. Example output is $4, 5, 6, 7$.\nThe lower bound is still off by 1.\n\nThe correct reasoning for the bounds $2^{c_1}$ and $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$ comes from considering the *sets* of skills involved.\nLet $S_{strong}$ be the set of skills that the winning team must be stronger than. $|S_{strong}| = c_1$.\nLet $S_{weak}$ be the set of skills that the winning team must be weaker than. $|S_{weak}| = c_0$.\nThe skill of the winning team $x$ must be such that $x \\notin S_{strong}$, $x \\notin S_{weak}$, and $S_{strong}$, $S_{weak}$, and $\\{x\\}$ are all disjoint.\nAlso, for any $s \\in S_{strong}$, $s < x$. For any $w \\in S_{weak}$, $w > x$.\n\nTo minimize $x$:\nWe want $S_{strong}$ to contain the smallest possible values. So $S_{strong} = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$ for some $k$.\nWe want $S_{weak}$ to contain values just above $x$. But these values must be chosen from the remaining $2^n - 1 - c_1$ values.\nThe key insight is that the teams that $x$ beats (by being stronger) are determined by $c_1$, and the teams that beat $x$ (by $x$ being weaker) are determined by $c_0$.\nThe specific values $2^{c_1}$ and $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$ are derived from the idea of \"slots\" or \"ranks\".\nIf $c_1$ games are won by higher skill, this means the winning team $x$ must be \"stronger\" than $c_1$ other teams. The smallest possible value for $x$ to be stronger than $c_1$ teams is $2^{c_1}$. This is because $x$ must be able to beat $c_1$ teams. The $c_1$ teams are $1, \\ldots, c_1$. So $x$ must be at least $c_1+1$.\nHowever, the $c_1$ teams $x$ beats are not necessarily $1, \\ldots, c_1$. They are $c_1$ distinct teams.\nThe minimum possible value a winning team can have is $2^{c_1}$. This corresponds to a scenario where the $c_1$ opponents it needs to beat are $1, \\ldots, 2^{c_1}-1$ (or some other $c_1$ values), and the $c_0$ opponents it needs to be beaten by are $2^{c_1}+1, \\ldots, 2^{c_1}+c_0$. This doesn't make sense.\n\nThe number of teams that a winning team must be \"stronger than\" is $c_1$.\nThe number of teams that a winning team must be \"weaker than\" is $c_0$.\nThe total number of teams is $2^n$.\nThe teams that $x$ is stronger than must be chosen from $\\{1, \\ldots, x-1\\}$.\nThe teams that $x$ is weaker than must be chosen from $\\{x+1, \\ldots, 2^n\\}$.\n\nTo minimize $x$: $x$ must be greater than $c_1$ values. The minimal set of such values is $\\{1, \\ldots, c_1\\}$. So $x \\ge c_1+1$.\nAlso, $x$ must be smaller than $c_0$ values. To minimize $x$, these $c_0$ values should be $x+1, \\ldots, x+c_0$.\nSo the set of values $\\{1, \\ldots, c_1, x, x+1, \\ldots, x+c_0\\}$ must be distinct and within $\\{1, \\ldots, 2^n\\}$.\nThe minimal value for $x$ is $c_1+1$. This is if $x$ is greater than $c_1$ values, and the $c_0$ values that are greater than $x$ are $c_1+2, \\ldots, c_1+1+c_0$.\nThis means the range of skills is $c_1+1$ to $2^n-c_0$. This is what I got initially.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully. \"if $s_i$ is equal to 0, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins; if $s_i$ is equal to 1, then during the $i$-th phase (the phase with $2^{n-i}$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.\"\nThis wording is crucial. It means for the *entire phase*, the rule is fixed.\n\nConsider the number of '1's in $s$, say $count_1$.\nThe winning team $X$ must win $count_1$ games by having a higher skill.\nThis means $X$ must be strictly greater than $count_1$ distinct skill values.\nThe smallest possible value for $X$ that satisfies this is $count_1 + 1$. (e.g., $X=count_1+1$ beats $1, \\ldots, count_1$).\n\nConsider the number of '0's in $s$, say $count_0$.\nThe winning team $X$ must win $count_0$ games by having a lower skill.\nThis means $X$ must be strictly smaller than $count_0$ distinct skill values.\nThe largest possible value for $X$ that satisfies this is $2^n - count_0$. (e.g., $X=2^n-count_0$ is smaller than $2^n-count_0+1, \\ldots, 2^n$).\n\nCombining these two:\n$count_1 + 1 \\le X \\le 2^n - count_0$.\nThis is the range of values $X$ can take.\nLet's check the examples with this formula:\n1. $n=3, s=\"101\"$. $count_0=1, count_1=2$. $2^n=8$.\n   $2+1 \\le X \\le 8-1 \\implies 3 \\le X \\le 7$.\n   Output: $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\n   Example output: $4, 5, 6, 7$.\n   My lower bound is still off by 1.\n\nThe difference of 1 for the lower bound suggests that $2^{c_1}$ is the correct lower bound, not $c_1+1$.\nAnd $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$ is the correct upper bound, not $2^n - c_0$.\n\nLet's use a different perspective.\nThe number of teams that are \"stronger\" than $x$ is $N_s$.\nThe number of teams that are \"weaker\" than $x$ is $N_w$.\n$x$ must be able to win $c_1$ games by being stronger.\n$x$ must be able to win $c_0$ games by being weaker.\n\nConsider the set of all $2^n$ skills.\nThe $c_1$ games where the higher skill wins mean that $x$ must be in the top $2^{n-c_1}$ teams if all other games were won by lower skill.\nThe $c_0$ games where the lower skill wins mean that $x$ must be in the bottom $2^{n-c_0}$ teams if all other games were won by higher skill.\n\nLet's think about the number of teams that can potentially win.\nIf all $s_i = '1'$, then the highest skill team wins. $c_1 = n, c_0 = 0$.\nMin skill: $2^n$. Max skill: $2^n - 2^0 + 1 = 2^n$. Only $2^n$ can win. Correct.\nIf all $s_i = '0'$, then the lowest skill team wins. $c_1 = 0, c_0 = n$.\nMin skill: $2^0 = 1$. Max skill: $2^n - 2^n + 1 = 1$. Only $1$ can win. Correct.\n\nSo the formulas $2^{c_1}$ and $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$ seem to be correct for these two edge cases.\nWhy $2^{c_1}$ as the minimum?\nA team $X$ wins $c_1$ games by being stronger. It means $X$ must be able to beat $c_1$ distinct opponents.\nThe minimum possible value for $X$ to achieve this is $2^{c_1}$.\nConsider the set of $2^{c_1}$ smallest numbers: $\\{1, \\ldots, 2^{c_1}\\}$.\nIf $X = 2^{c_1}$, can it win $c_1$ games by being stronger? Yes, by beating $c_1$ distinct opponents from $\\{1, \\ldots, 2^{c_1}-1\\}$.\nThe remaining $c_0$ games $X$ must win by being weaker. This means $X$ must be smaller than $c_0$ distinct opponents.\nIf $X = 2^{c_1}$, it can be smaller than $c_0$ opponents chosen from $\\{2^{c_1}+1, \\ldots, 2^n\\}$. This is possible as long as $2^n - 2^{c_1} \\ge c_0$.\n$2^n - 2^{c_1} \\ge n - c_1$. This is generally true for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nWhy $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$ as the maximum?\nA team $X$ wins $c_0$ games by being weaker. It means $X$ must be smaller than $c_0$ distinct opponents.\nThe maximum possible value for $X$ to achieve this is $2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$.\nConsider the set of $2^{c_0}$ largest numbers: $\\{2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1, \\ldots, 2^n\\}$.\nIf $X = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$, can it win $c_0$ games by being weaker? Yes, by being weaker than $c_0$ distinct opponents from $\\{2^n - 2^{c_0} + 2, \\ldots, 2^n\\}$.\nThe remaining $c_1$ games $X$ must win by being stronger. This means $X$ must be greater than $c_1$ distinct opponents.\nIf $X = 2^n - 2^{c_0} + 1$, it can be greater than $c_1$ opponents chosen from $\\{1, \\ldots, 2^n - 2^{c_0}\\}$. This is possible as long as $2^n - 2^{c_0} \\ge c_1$.\n$2^n - 2^{c_0} \\ge n - c_0$. This is also generally true.\n\nThis logic seems sound and matches all examples.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Read $n$.\n2. Read string $s$.\n3. Count $c_0$ (number of '0's in $s$) and $c_1$ (number of '1's in $s$).\n4. Calculate `min_winning_skill = 2**c_1`.\n5. Calculate `max_winning_skill = (2**n) - (2**c_0) + 1`.\n6. Print all integers from `min_winning_skill` to `max_winning_skill` (inclusive), separated by spaces.\n\nExample walkthrough: $n=3, s=\"101\"$\n$c_0 = 1$ (one '0' at $s[1]$)\n$c_1 = 2$ (two '1's at $s[0]$ and $s[2]$)\n$2^n = 2^3 = 8$.\n\n`min_winning_skill = 2**c_1 = 2**2 = 4`.\n`max_winning_skill = (2**n) - (2**c_0) + 1 = 8 - (2**1) + 1 = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7`.\n\nResulting integers: $4, 5, 6, 7$. Print them in ascending order.\n\nThis approach is efficient. It involves a single pass over the string $s$ to count '0's and '1's, and then a simple loop to print the numbers. $n$ is up to 18, so $2^n$ can be up to $2^{18} = 262144$. Printing these numbers is fine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    count_0 = s.count('0')\n    count_1 = s.count('1')\n\n    # Calculate the minimum winning skill\n    # A team must win count_1 games by having higher skill.\n    # This means it must be strictly greater than count_1 distinct skill values.\n    # The smallest possible skill value that can achieve this is 2^count_1.\n    # Example: if count_1 = 2, min_skill = 2^2 = 4.\n    # Team with skill 4 can beat skills 1, 2, 3.
