Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**My Thinking on Array Stabilization**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. We've got this array, and we need to make it \"stable\" by removing one element. \"Stable\" means minimizing the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. The brute force approach of checking every possible removal would be too slow, given the array size.  So, I started by thinking about how to actually *minimize* that difference.\n\nIt quickly became clear: the smallest difference would occur when the new range (after removing an element) is as small as possible. This means we want to either push the minimum value up or pull the maximum value down.\n\nSorting the array is the key here.  Once it's sorted,  we can see that the instability will either be the second largest element minus the original smallest element, or the original largest element minus the second smallest. Any other removal won't improve the instability. It can only be equal or worse.\n\nSo, I need to compare the two \"removal scenarios\": removing the smallest element vs. removing the largest. Calculate the instability for each of these. The minimum of those two is my answer. Edge cases of n=2 are naturally handled. Simple to implement and understand.  The core idea is to realize only 2 options are necessary and that means only a simple calculation and `min()` call is required.  Sorting is `O(N log N)` which is ok given the constraints.\n",
