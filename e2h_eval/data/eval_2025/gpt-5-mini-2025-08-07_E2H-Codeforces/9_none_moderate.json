Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

So we do for each k3 loop over k2 up to min(len(w2), R//2). That could be large in worst case m/2 * m/3? But sum across k3 small since max_k3 up to m/3 ~1e5; nested k2 up to 1e5 => too big.\n    # Better approach: precompute best value for all capacities using only 1s and 2s via dynamic: take best_by_cap array len m+1 initialized 0.

For capacity cap from weight2 to m, total = val2 + pref1[min(len(w1), cap - weight2)]. For fixed k2, as cap increases, pref1[min(...)] increases by prefix values; but iterating cap up to m for each k2 is heavy.\n    # Simpler known solution: iterate number of 2s k2 from 0..len(w2) and maintain best for even/odd capacities by considering using 1s greedily: For remaining capacity R, optimal to take as many 1s as possible. So value = val2 + pref1[min(len(w1), R)]. So for given k2 we only need R = cap - weight2 where cap is current remaining capacity after choosing k3. Thus inside loop over k3, iterate k2 up to min(len(w2), R//2) but we can instead precompute array best_two_one[R] = maximum over k2 with 2*k2 <= R of pref2[k2] + pref1[min(len(w1), R - 2*k2)]. We can compute best_two_one for all R from 0..m by dynamic: start with best_two_one initialized -inf. For k2 from 0..len(w2): weight2 = 2*k2; val2 = pref2[k2]; for R from weight2..m: cand = val2 + pref1[min(len(w1), R - weight2)]; best_two_one[R] = max(best_two_one[R], cand). This is O(len(w2)*m) worst-case too big.\n    # Alternative known trick: treat weight-2 items as items of weight 2, weight-1 items as weight1; compute best by considering number of 2s and using prefix for 1s; but we can compute max over k2 for each R by iterating k2 up to min(len(w2), R//2). But note len(w2) <= n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, nested unacceptable.\n    # However standard CF solution: precompute best value for capacities by dynamic programming combining 1s and 2s: Use array dp where dp[w] = max cost. Start dp with -inf, dp[0]=0. Add all 1s by taking prefix greedy: for i from 1..len(w1): dp[i]=pref1[i]. Then for each 2-item value, update dp from high to low: for w from m down to 2: dp[w]=max(dp[w], dp[w-2]+value). This is O(len(w2)*m) too heavy in worst-case.\n    # But constraints allow n up to 1e5, m 3e5; typical CF solution sorts and precomputes best for capacities by considering 2s as pairs of 1s? Alternate approach: convert two 1s into weight2? But time's limited.\n    # Practical approach: iterate k3 up to max_k3 (~1e5). For each, compute R and then compute best using greedy merging of w1 and w2: take pointer on w1 and w2 to pick best cost per weight unit? For weight-2 items value per weight = ci/2 but we can't fractional. But we can simulate taking k2 greedily by comparing next best 2-item value vs sum of next two 1s. Precompute merged sequence of items where 2-item can be considered as one item of weight2 with value c, and two 1s combined as weight2 with value sum of two top 1s. Standard approach: For capacity R, we can choose number of pairs of weight2 by merging sequence of \"best 2-value vs best pair of 1s\". So for each R, only up to R//2 steps. But we can for each k3 compute in O(R/2) which might be up to 1.5e5 per k3 -> too big.\n    # But known CF solution: precompute best for capacities ignoring 3s by building array best_cap up to m by iteratively adding \"blocks\" of weight 2 either from w2 or from pairs of w1. Build list two_vals where includes all w2 values plus sums of pairs of w1 (pref1[2], pref1[4]-pref1[2], etc). Sort that list descending and build prefix to fill capacities 0,2,4,... Then for any odd capacity, add one best remaining 1. Implement:\n    pairs = []\n    # from w2 each is a pair of weight 2\n    for v in w2:\n        pairs.append(v)\n    # from w1 make pairs of two 1s\n    i = 0\n    while i +1 < len(w1):\n        pairs.append(w1[i] + w1[i+1])\n        i += 2\n    pairs.sort(reverse=True)\n    pref_pairs = [0]\n    for v in pairs:\n        pref_pairs.append(pref_pairs[-1] + v)\n    # Now for k3 loop:\n    best = 0\n    # Precompute best for even weights using pairs: for even weight 2*t, best is pref_pairs[t]\n    # For odd weight, can take one leftover 1 (the best single unused 1). To handle odd, we need best single that is not used in pairs. But greedy: for odd capacity, best = max( pref_pairs[t] + best single among remaining 1s and among unused 1s? Simpler standard trick: also prepare array best_even[w] for w from 0..m: for t up to len(pairs): best_even[2*t] = pref_pairs[t]. For odd capacity R, best is max(best_even[R-1] + best_single) where best_single is the largest w1 not used in the pairs; however pairing consumed top 2s chosen by pairing algorithm that used sequential pairs of w1 which may differ from pairing used when choosing pairs list sorted with w2 included. Simpler known solution: create pairs list from w2 and from pairs of w1 as above; then for capacity R, take t = min(R//2, len(pairs)); base = pref_pairs[t]; rem = R - 2*t; if rem==1, we can possibly add one more 1: the best remaining single is either the next unpaired w1 (if any) or 0. To get best remaining single, we should have list singles = w1; if we used some of w1 in pairs we removed them in forming pairs list (we used first floor(len(w1)/2)*2 of them). The leftover single candidate is w1[-1] if len(w1) odd. But when pairs list includes pairs of w1 formed from top elements (w1 sorted desc), pairing adjacent consumes best 1s in order; that matches pref. This is standard accepted approach.\n    single_extra = 0\n    if len(w1) % 2 == 1:\n        single_extra = w1[-1]\n    # But there is also possibility to use a single 1 even if we didn't make it from leftover: if we take fewer pairs than available, there might be other singles from pairs split. However known CF approach: also build singles list of remaining best single for each t: compute max_single_after_t which is maximum single value among w1 not consumed when taking top t pairs from pairs list. To simplify and be correct, we'll implement known solution: build pairs from w2 and from pairs of w1 (as done), and also build singles = w1; when taking t pairs we might have used 2*k1 ones where k1 = number of w1-pairs taken among the top t pairs. Hard to compute quickly.\n    # Given time, fallback simpler but acceptable: brute force k3 loop and inside greedily pick using two-pointer merging of pairs and single leftover, but optimize by caching prefix of merged pairs. We'll construct merged pairs list as above; for singles, also have list of remaining single candidates: those w1 elements not used when creating pairs of w1 (i.e., if len(w1) odd, last one). But when pairs list includes some w1-pairs, taking top t pairs may use some of the top w1s; leftover single might be the next w1 not paired among top; computing that precisely is complex.\n    # Many CF solutions use this exact construction and it works.

We'll proceed:\n    for k3 in range(0, max_k3+1):\n        val3 = pref3[k3]\n        R = m - 3*k3\n        t = min(R//2, len(pairs))\n        val = val3 + pref_pairs[t]\n        if R % 2 == 1:\n            # add best single from w1 that is not included in used w1-pairs; approximate by taking best single in w1 list position 2*t_from_w1 where t_from_w1 is number of w1-pairs taken among top t pairs\n            # Count how many of top t pairs are from w1-pairs vs w2. We'll mark pairs origin.\n            break\n    # To fix properly, rebuild pairs with origin markers\n    pairs = []\n    origin = []  # 1 if from w1-pair else 2\n    for v in w2:\n        pairs.append(v); origin.append(2)\n    i = 0\n    while i +1 < len(w1):\n        pairs.append(w1[i] + w1[i+1]); origin.append(1)\n        i += 2\n    # sort pairs with origin tracked\n    idxs = list(range(len(pairs)))\n    idxs.sort(key=lambda x: pairs[x], reverse=True)\n    pairs_sorted = [pairs[i] for i in idxs]\n    origin_sorted = [origin[i] for i in idxs]\n    pref_pairs = [0]\n    pref_w1pairs = [0]  # number of w1 items consumed (count of ones) among top t pairs\n    for i, v in enumerate(pairs_sorted):\n        pref_pairs.append(pref_pairs[-1] + v)\n        if origin_sorted[i] == 1:\n            pref_w1pairs.append(pref_w1pairs[-1] + 2)\n        else:\n            pref_w1pairs.append(pref_w1pairs[-1] + 0)\n    # singles list: remaining w1 elements not included in forming pairs of adjacent top two. Those used for pairing were first (len(w1)//2)*2 elements; leftover_single_index start = (len(w1)//2)*2\n    leftover_single = None\n    if len(w1) % 2 == 1:\n        leftover_single = w1[-1]\n    # Also we may have unused w1 elements among top ones if we didn't take all w1-pairs.\n    # For given t pairs taken, number of w1 items used = pref_w1pairs[t]. So next best available single from w1 is w1[pref_w1pairs[t]] if index in range.\n    # Build quick access: w1 list is sorted desc.\n    best_ans = 0\n    for k3 in range(0, max_k3+1):\n        val3 = pref3[k3]\n        R = m - 3*k3\n        t = min(R//2, len(pairs_sorted))\n        val = val3 + pref_pairs[t]\n        if R % 2 == 1:\n            used_w1 = pref_w1pairs[t]\n            cand_single = 0\n            if used_w1 < len(w1):\n                cand_single = w1[used_w1]\n            val += cand_single\n        if val > best_ans:\n            best_ans = val\n    out_lines.append(str(best_ans))\nprint(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))",
