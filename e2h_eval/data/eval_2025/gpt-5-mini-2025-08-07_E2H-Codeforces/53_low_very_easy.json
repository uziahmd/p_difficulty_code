Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "**Implementing substring detection**\n\nI'm planning to check for repeated substrings of decreasing lengths, starting from n-1 down to 1. Since n is really small (up to 100), an O(n^2) algorithm should be fine. I'll implement a function that loops through possible lengths and uses a set to keep track of seen substrings. If a substring appears again, it indicates a duplicate. For multiple test cases, I’ll print each result on a new line and skip any empty lines. Let's get going with the code!",
