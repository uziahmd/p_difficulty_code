Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

Actually adjacency between regions corresponds to crossing a line without hitting intersection. Standard solution: build graph where vertices are lines and also start/end as nodes; connect two lines if they intersect at a point that is not on any other line. Also connect start to line if segment from start to a far point crosses that line without passing through intersection? Simpler: construct graph of regions via dual: nodes are lines + S and T, edges between lines if they intersect at a unique point (i.e., not parallel) and that intersection is not lying on any other line.

No.\n\n# Alternative brute-force: Each region corresponds to sign vector (excluding zeros). You can move between two regions if their sign vectors differ in exactly one position AND there exists a shared nonzero boundary segment => meaning the line where sign differs is not intersected between the two regions by an intersection point exclusively. For line i, two regions that differ only at i are adjacent if there is a point on that line where no other line passes (i.e., the line has at least one point not lying on any other line). That is true if line i is not completely covered by intersections (but intersections are discrete, so always exists unless all other lines intersect it at all points? impossible). But need common segment: the shared border is a segment of the line between intersection points; nonzero length iff line has at least one segment between intersections. For two regions with same sign vector except i, they are adjacent if there exists some open segment on line i whose sides across that segment correspond to those sign assignments for other lines. That happens if there exists a point on line i where for all other lines j, sign at that point equals the given sign vector's j. So we can perform BFS on sign vectors by flipping single bits when feasible: check for each line i whether there exists a point on line i satisfying sign constraints for all other lines.\n\n# Implement check: for line i, find an x point on line i such that for all j!=i, sign(a_j x + b_j y + c_j) == target_sign_j. Parameterize line i: if bi !=0, express x=t, y = (-a_i t - c_i)/b_i. Else ai!=0 -> y=t, x = (-b_i t - c_i)/a_i. Then each other line gives linear function in t: val_j(t) = A_j t + B_j.
