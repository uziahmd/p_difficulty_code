Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Clarifying input handling**\n\nI need to clarify how to read the input since the sample shows list representation. The problem statement gives examples, but they suggest only one string per run, even though the input format seems to hint at handling multiple lines. It’s confusing because the sample presents multiple test cases as a list, which isn't typical for ICS problems. I guess I’ll have to read the entire input and possibly treat each line as a separate test case based on what they expect.",
