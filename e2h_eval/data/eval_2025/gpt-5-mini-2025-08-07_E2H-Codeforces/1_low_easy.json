            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Golden Plate\n\nYou have a plate and you want to add some gilding to it. The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Calculating ring perimeters**\n\nI need to compute the sum of the perimeters of multiple rings. For each ring `i`, the dimensions are adjusted by subtracting `4*i` from both the width and height. The perimeter is calculated as `2*(w_i + h_i) - 4`, since I have to avoid double-counting the corners. I should consider constraints that ensure valid input values. While implementing, I'll handle cases for multiple test cases, reading input correctly from standard input. Let's get that done!",
