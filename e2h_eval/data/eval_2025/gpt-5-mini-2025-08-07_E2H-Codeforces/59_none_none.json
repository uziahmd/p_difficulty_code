In order to make Chaneka happy, you must find the number of different arrays containing $$$N$$$ sets $$$[S_1, S_2, S_3, \\ldots, S_N]$$$ such that: - Each set can only contain zero or more different integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$K$$$. - There exists a way to rearrange the order of the array of sets into $$$[S'_1, S'_2, S'_3, \\ldots, S'_N]$$$ such that $$$S'_i$$$ is a child of $$$S'_{i+1}$$$ for each $$$1\\leq i\\leq N-1$$$.Print the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.Two sets are considered different if and only if there is at least one value that only occurs in one of the two sets.Two arrays of sets are considered different if and only if there is at least one index $$$i$$$ such that the sets at index $$$i$$$ in the two arrays are different.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$K$$$ ($$$1 \\leq N,K \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$$$) â€” the number of sets in the array and the maximum limit for the values in the sets.\n\n## Output\nAn integer representing the number of different arrays of sets that satisfy the problem condition, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2 2', '1 3', '3 1']\n\n### Output\n['11', '8', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$11$$$ different arrays of sets possible, which are:   $$$[\\{\\}, \\{\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{\\}, \\{1, 2\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{\\}, \\{2\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{1\\}, \\{\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{1\\}, \\{1, 2\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{1, 2\\}, \\{\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{1, 2\\}, \\{1\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{2\\}, \\{\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{2\\}, \\{1\\}]$$$ \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

But checking samples: for N=2,K=2 -> C(4,2)=6 not 11.\n        # Actual CF problem 1731A? No. I must recall: each element value v behaves independently: for value v, let cnt_v be number of sets that contain v. Child relation requires cnt_v <= cnt_{v+1}. After permutation we can arrange levels nondecreasing so counts form nonincreasing? For child definition: A child of B means every x in A implies x+1 in B. For chain S1' child of S2' ..., it forces for each value v, the sequence of indicators over sets when shifted... Ultimately condition equivalent to for each v, number of sets containing v is <= number containing v+1. So counts c1..cK are nonincreasing? Actually cnt_v <= cnt_{v+1} so nondecreasing.\n        # We have N sets unordered positions matter (array), but sets are labeled by positions. However counts only depend on multiset of sets; but arrays count permutations of sets considered distinct.\n        # Approach: first count number of distinct sets types across values independent: For each value v, choose which cnt_v sets (out of N positions) contain v. Constraints cnt_1 <= cnt_2 <= ... <= cnt_K.\n        # For fixed nondecreasing sequence c1..cK (0..N) number of arrays = product over v of C(N, c_v) because for each value choose positions independently. So total = sum_{0<=c1<=...<=cK<=N} prod C(N, c_v).\n        # This equals coefficient: consider polynomial P(x)=sum_{c=0..N} C(N,c) x^c = (1+x)^N. Then sum over nondecreasing sequence of c's of product C(N,c_v) equals sum_{0<=c1<=...<=cK} prod a_{c_v} where a_c=C(N,c). That's equal to sum_{m=0..N} number of weak compositions? This is standard: equals coefficient of nondecreasing is equal to coefficient of y^? Alternative trick: it's equal to coefficient of t^0...? But known identity: sum_{0<=c1<=...<=cK<=N} prod a_{c_v} = coefficient of x^0? Hard.\n        # Transform by differences: Let d1=c1, d2=c2-c1,... dk=cK-c_{K-1}, dk+1 = N - cK >=0. All di >=0 and sum di = N. Then c_v = sum_{i<=v} d_i. Product C(N, c_v).

Wait check samples: N=2,K=2->11. Let's attempt compute via dynamic programming: compute DP over v building counts of c previous. We'll implement DP O(K*N) which with 2e5^2 too big. But we can swap loops: N,K up to 2e5 but product K*N too big.\n        # However known result from CF problem \"Happy Sets\" (problem 1731B?) yields answer = C(N+K, N) * 2^{N-1}?
