The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 1 to 200000). There are n+2 towns (0 to n+1) and we build a tower in each town i (from 1 to n) independently with probability 1/2.\n\n Conditions:\n  - Towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal.\n  - Each town from 1 to n must get signal from exactly one radio tower.\n\n How the signal works: A tower at town i with power p covers all towns c such that |c-i| < p.\n\n Observation:\n\n Since we can choose the signal powers arbitrarily (each from 1 to n), we have freedom. However, we must assign a power to each tower (if built) so that:\n\n   For each town j in {1, 2, ..., n}:\n      There is exactly one tower (say at position i) such that |j-i| < p_i.\n\n   And for towns 0 and n+1, there is no tower i (for which the condition holds).\n\n Conditions on the assignment:\n\n   For a built tower at i, we can set its power p_i to at least 1 and at most n.\n\n   The coverage of tower i: \n        Covers [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1] (integer points)\n\n   But note: We require that:\n        - The union of the intervals (with chosen powers) must cover every town from 1 to n, and no overlap (each town covered by exactly one).\n        - Also, the intervals must not extend to 0 or n+1.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require that the towers only cover their own assigned area? Actually, the condition is:\n\n        Town 0: not covered by any tower -> so the leftmost point of any tower's coverage must be at least 1 (so that it doesn't cover 0). Similarly, the rightmost point must be at most n (so that n+1 is not covered).\n\n But note: a tower at i can cover from i-p_i+1 to i+p_i-1. To not cover 0: we must have i-p_i+1 >= 1? Actually, we require that 0 is not covered, so for every tower i, we must have 0 not in [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1]. Similarly, for n+1, we require n+1 not in [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1].\n\n However, note that the problem allows us to set the powers arbitrarily (as long as they are integers from 1 to n). Therefore, for a built tower at i, we can choose a power p_i that avoids covering 0 and n+1. But also, we must arrange so that the coverage of the towers together forms a partition of [1, n] and does not extend to 0 or n+1.\n\n Alternatively, think about the constraints:\n\n   Condition 1: The leftmost coverage of a tower must be at least 1. The rightmost must be at most n.\n\n   Condition 2: The entire set of towns from 1 to n must be covered exactly once.\n\n How can we assign the powers?\n\n Let S be the set of built towers (subset of {1,2,...,n}). Then we need to assign a power p_i for each i in S.\n\n Consider that we want to cover the towns 1 to n. Notice that the towers are located at integer positions 1..n.\n\n One idea: we can assign to each tower i a power p_i = 1. Then the tower at i covers [i, i] (only the town i). This would satisfy the condition that each town j (from 1 to n) is covered by the tower at j (if built) and only by that one. However, then we must have that all towers from 1 to n are built. Why? Because if a tower is missing, say town j is missing, then there is no tower to cover j. But wait, we might use larger powers to cover multiple towns?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"exactly one\" per town. So we cannot have two towers covering the same town.\n\n However, we can use larger powers to cover multiple consecutive towns, but then we have to avoid covering the same town twice.\n\n Example from the problem: n=5, built in towns 2,4,5. They set tower 2 to 2 (covers [0,3] but wait: |c-2| < 2 => c from 1 to 3). Then set 4 to 1 (covers [4,4]) and 5 to 1 (covers [5,5]). Then:\n\n   Town 1: covered by tower 2 (since |1-2|=1 < 2)\n   Town 2: covered by tower 2 (|2-2|=0 <2)\n   Town 3: covered by tower 2 (|3-2|=1 <2)\n   Town 4: covered by tower 4 (|4-4|=0<1)\n   Town 5: covered by tower 5 (|5-5|=0<1)\n\n But wait, what about town 0? \n        Tower 2: |0-2|=2 -> not less than 2 -> not covered.\n        Tower 4: |0-4|=4 -> not less than 1 -> not covered.\n        Tower 5: |0-5|=5 -> not less than 1 -> not covered.\n\n Similarly, n+1=6: \n        |6-2|=4 -> not <2 -> not covered by tower2.\n        |6-4|=2 -> not <1 -> not covered by tower4.\n        |6-5|=1 -> not <1 -> not covered by tower5.\n\n So this assignment works.\n\n However, note that the example also shows that we don't necessarily need every tower to be built.\n\n What are the necessary conditions for a set S (built towers) to be able to assign powers so that:\n\n   (a) Each town j in [1, n] is covered by exactly one tower (which must be in S, and note that the tower must be built to cover it).\n\n   (b) Town 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\n How can we cover the towns? We can use the following idea:\n\n   We can view the problem as: we want to cover the contiguous segment [1, n] with intervals (each interval is centered at a built tower and has an integer radius from 1 to n) such that:\n\n        - Each town is covered by exactly one interval.\n        - The intervals do not extend beyond [1, n] (so the leftmost point of the interval for a tower at i must be >=1, and the rightmost <=n).\n\n   Note: The condition for a tower at i with power p_i: \n        Left endpoint: L_i = i - p_i + 1, Right endpoint: R_i = i + p_i - 1.\n\n   We require L_i >= 1 and R_i <= n.\n\n   Additionally, the intervals must form a partition of [1, n]: meaning they are disjoint and their union is [1, n].\n\n   But note: the intervals are symmetric about i, but the condition |c-i| < p_i is equivalent to c in (i-p_i, i+p_i). Since we are dealing with integers, it becomes [i-p_i+1, i+p_i-1].\n\n   Now, consider: we can assign different powers to the same tower? But note the condition that each town must be covered by exactly one tower. So we must assign the powers such that the intervals do not overlap and together cover [1, n].\n\n   However, note that the problem does not require that the entire segment [1, n] is covered by the union of the intervals? Actually, the condition says that towns 1 to n must be covered. So we require the union to be [1, n].\n\n   But wait: what if a tower's interval goes beyond [1, n]? Then we must avoid that because then condition (a) might break (if we set a power that extends too far, then we might cover 0 or n+1, which is forbidden) and also condition (b) requires that 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\n   So we must choose p_i such that:\n        For each tower i in S: \n            L_i = i - p_i + 1 >= 1   => p_i <= i\n            R_i = i + p_i - 1 <= n    => p_i <= n - i + 1\n\n   Therefore, for a tower at i, the maximum allowed power is min(i, n-i+1).\n\n   Moreover, we must cover [1, n] with the intervals. How can we do that?\n\n   Another observation: the problem is similar to covering the segment [1, n] with intervals that are centered at the built towers, and the length of the interval is determined by the power (but we can choose the power arbitrarily as long as it doesn't exceed the above constraint). However, we also require that the intervals do not overlap and cover [1, n].\n\n   We can think of the problem as: we have a set of centers (built towers) and we wish to assign to each center a radius (power) such that the intervals [center-radius+1, center+radius-1] form a partition of [1, n] and the radius is at most min(center, n-center+1).\n\n   But note: the condition that the intervals do not overlap and together cover [1, n] is very strict.\n\n   Alternate viewpoint: we can model the problem by breaking [1, n] into segments that are assigned to each built tower. Moreover, the assignment must be contiguous. \n\n   Consider: if we let x_i be the power assigned to tower i (if built), then the interval for tower i is [i - x_i + 1, i + x_i - 1]. \n\n   We require that the intervals are adjacent and non-overlapping. In fact, they must form a contiguous covering. \n\n   Now, note that the entire set of built towers must be used to cover [1, n]. However, we can skip some towns? Actually, we must cover every town.\n\n   Another idea: we can think of the problem as assigning each town j (from 1 to n) to a tower. The condition for a town j to be covered by a tower i is that |j-i| < p_i. But note: we can choose p_i arbitrarily (within the constraints) and independently for each tower. However, we must assign each j to exactly one tower.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the problem is symmetric and the coverage condition is similar to having a Voronoi diagram with Manhattan distance? Not exactly.\n\n   Let's reframe: we have built a set S of towers. We wish to know whether there exists an assignment of powers (each tower i in S gets an integer p_i in [1, min(i, n-i+1)]) such that:\n\n        (1) Each j in [1, n] is covered by at least one tower in S (actually, exactly one, but the condition of exactly one will be enforced by the partitioning).\n        (2) The intervals do not overlap.\n\n   But note: the condition of exactly one is equivalent to saying that the intervals form a partition.\n\n   How to check for a given S? \n\n   We can use dynamic programming or greedy? But note: n up to 200000.\n\n   However, note that the problem asks for the probability (over the independent tower building) that there exists an assignment of powers satisfying the conditions.\n\n   The probability that a particular tower is built is 1/2, so the set S is chosen uniformly from all subsets of {1,2,...,n}. \n\n   We need to count the number of subsets S (of {1,2,...,n}) for which there exists an assignment of powers (with the constraints) that satisfies the conditions.\n\n   Then, the probability is (# of good subsets) * (2^(n))^{-1} mod 998244353.\n\n   But note: each subset S is chosen with probability (1/2)^n, so the total number of subsets is 2^n, and the probability is (# of good subsets) / 2^n.\n\n   However, the answer is the probability, so we compute (# of good subsets) * inv(2^n) mod 998244353.\n\n   How to count the good subsets?\n\n   Let's analyze the structure:\n\n   We must cover [1, n]. The entire set {1,2,...,n} must be covered. The built towers must be contiguous? Not necessarily. But note: if we leave a gap, then how do we cover the gap?\n\n   Actually, the problem is similar to the classic \"covering segments\" but with fixed centers and variable radii.\n\n   Consider: the leftmost town is 1. Which tower can cover 1? Only a tower at i=1 or i=2 (because |1-1|=0, |1-2|=1, etc.) but note the condition for a tower at i to cover 1: we require |1-i| < p_i. The minimum p_i is 1, so |1-i| must be less than 1? That is only possible if i=1 (then |1-1|=0<1) or i=2 (then |1-2|=1, so we require p_2>1, i.e., at least 2). \n\n   Similarly, the rightmost town n: must be covered by a tower at i=n (with p_n>=1) or i=n-1 (then we need p_{n-1}>1, i.e., at least 2).\n\n   Now, let's define:\n\n        For a built tower at i, the maximum left extension is i (if we set p_i = i, then the left endpoint is 1) and the maximum right extension is n (if we set p_i = n-i+1, then the right endpoint is n).\n\n   However, we must assign powers so that the entire [1, n] is covered and the intervals do not overlap.\n\n   Another idea: consider that the set S must form a set of centers that can \"chain\" together to cover the entire [1, n] without gaps. Moreover, the condition that the intervals do not extend beyond [1, n] is automatically satisfied if we choose the power appropriately (we can always choose a power that just covers the necessary part). But note: we must cover without gaps and without overlaps.\n\n   How can we cover [1, n]?\n\n   We can use the following greedy idea:\n\n        We must cover 1. The only way to cover 1 is by a tower at 1 (with power 1) or by a tower at 2 (with power at least 2) or by a tower at 3 (with power at least 3) ... but wait, a tower at i (>=1) can cover 1 if and only if |1-i| < p_i, i.e., p_i > |1-i| = i-1. So the smallest power we can assign to tower i to cover 1 is i (since we need p_i >= i). However, note that if we assign p_i = i, then the left endpoint is 1 (since i - i + 1 = 1). Then the interval for tower i is [1, 2*i-1]. \n\n        But then, if we use tower i (>=2) to cover 1, then the next town (2) must be covered by either the same tower (if 2 is in [1, 2*i-1]) or by another tower. However, if we use tower i (>=2) to cover 1, then the interval [1, 2*i-1] will cover at least from 1 to 2*i-1. Then we must cover the rest from 2*i to n.\n\n   However, note that if we use a tower at i (>=2) to cover 1, then we must not use a tower at 1. Then how do we cover 2? It could be covered by the same tower i if 2 is in [1, 2*i-1] (which it is, because 2 <= 2*i-1 for i>=2). But then we have covered both 1 and 2 by the same tower. Then what about the next town? \n\n   But the condition requires that each town is covered by exactly one tower.\n\n   Therefore, if we use a tower at i (>=2) to cover 1, then we cannot use a tower at 2 (because then 2 would be covered by two towers: the one at i and the one at 2). Similarly, we must not use a tower at any j in [1, 2*i-1] except i? Actually, no: we can use other towers, but their intervals must not overlap.\n\n   However, note: if we use a tower at i (>=2) and set p_i = i, then it covers [1, 2*i-1]. Then we cannot use any tower at positions from 1 to 2*i-1 (except i) because:\n\n        If we use a tower at j (in [1, i-1]), then it must not cover the segment [1, 2*i-1] (or at least the part that is already covered by i). But note: the condition is that each town is covered by exactly one tower. Therefore, if two intervals overlap, then the condition fails.\n\n   Therefore, the set S must be such that the intervals (assigned optimally) do not overlap and cover [1, n].\n\n   Now, consider that we can choose the powers arbitrarily (within the constraints). How to assign powers optimally?\n\n   We can use the following strategy:\n\n        We break the segment [1, n] into contiguous blocks. Each block is covered by one tower. The tower that covers a block must be at the center of the block? Not necessarily, but note: the interval is symmetric about the center. \n\n        However, observe: the interval [L, R] must be centered at an integer i (the tower location) and the length is (R-L+1) = (i+p_i-1) - (i-p_i+1) + 1 = 2*p_i-1. \n\n        Also, the block must be contained within [1, n] and the center i must be in [L, R] (actually, the center is the middle of the interval).\n\n        Moreover, the condition that the intervals do not overlap and cover [1, n] forces that the blocks are adjacent.\n\n   Another idea: we can use a greedy covering from left to right.\n\n        The first town 1 must be covered by a tower. The candidate towers that can cover 1 are those at positions i>=1, and the minimal power needed for tower i is i (to cover 1). But if we choose a tower at i, then it will cover from 1 to 2*i-1. Then the next uncovered town is 2*i.\n\n        Then we must cover from 2*i to n. The next tower must be placed at 2*i (because we cannot use a tower at a position less than 2*i: why? because if we use a tower at j < 2*i, then it would cover from j-(min_power) to j+(min_power)-1, but note we have already covered [1, 2*i-1] so j must be at least 2*i. Actually, the next tower must be at 2*i, and then we set its power to 1 (so it covers [2*i, 2*i])? But wait, the condition for the next tower: we need to cover 2*i. The minimal power for tower at 2*i to cover 2*i is 1. Then the next uncovered town is 2*i+1.\n\n        However, what if we set the power of the next tower to more than 1? Then it would cover more. But we want to avoid overlapping. Actually, the previous tower's coverage ends at 2*i-1, so the next tower must start at 2*i. The minimal power to cover 2*i is 1 (so the interval is [2*i, 2*i]). Then the next town 2*i+1 must be covered by a tower at 2*i+1 (with power 1) or by a tower at 2*i+2 (with power at least 2) or a tower at 2*i-1? But wait, we cannot use a tower at 2*i-1 because then the interval for 2*i-1 would extend to (2*i-1)-p_{2*i-1}+1 to (2*i-1)+p_{2*i-1}-1. We already set the power for the first tower to i (which covers up to 2*i-1) and then the next tower at 2*i-1? But 2*i-1 is already covered by the first tower (if i>=2, then 2*i-1 >= 3, and the first tower covers up to 2*i-1, so 2*i-1 is already covered). So we cannot use a tower at 2*i-1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a tower at 2*i+1 to cover 2*i+1, but then we must set its power to 1. Or we can use a tower at 2*i+2 to cover 2*i+1? Then the power for that tower must be at least 2 (because |(2*i+1)-(2*i+2)|=1, so we need p_{2*i+2} > 1 -> at least 2). Then the interval for 2*i+2 would be [2*i+2-2+1, 2*i+2+2-1] = [2*i+1, 2*i+3]. Then we cover 2*i+1 and 2*i+3 (if we set p=2). Then the next town 2*i+2 is already covered by the tower at 2*i+2? Actually, the tower at 2*i+2 is at 2*i+2, so it covers 2*i+2 as well. Then we have:\n\n          First tower: [1, 2*i-1]\n          Second tower: [2*i, 2*i] (if we set power=1 at 2*i) OR [2*i+1, 2*i+3] (if we set power=2 at 2*i+2) but then we have a gap at 2*i+2 if we set the second tower at 2*i+2 and power=2? Actually, the second tower at 2*i+2 with power=2 covers [2*i+1, 2*i+3]. Then the town 2*i is left uncovered.\n\n        So we must cover 2*i. Therefore, we must have a tower at 2*i with power 1, or a tower at 2*i+1 with power at least 2 (so that it covers 2*i)? \n\n        Let's try: \n          If we set a tower at 2*i+1 with power 2: then it covers [2*i+1-2+1, 2*i+1+2-1] = [2*i, 2*i+2]. Then we cover 2*i, 2*i+1, and 2*i+2. Then we don't need a tower at 2*i.\n\n        Then the pattern is:\n\n          Use a tower at i (with power i) to cover [1, 2*i-1].\n          Then use a tower at 2*i (optional) to cover [2*i, 2*i] (if we don't use the next tower to cover 2*i, then we must use a tower at 2*i) OR use a tower at 2*i+1 with power 2 to cover [2*i, 2*i+2].\n\n        This suggests that the set S must include certain positions to cover the entire [1, n].\n\n   We can define:\n\n        Let F(i) be the minimal requirement for covering starting at i.\n\n        However, note: the problem is symmetric and we can use a recursive structure.\n\n   After reading the examples and the sample answers, note:\n\n        Input: 2 -> Output: 748683265 (which is 1/4 mod 998244353: because 1/4 mod 998244353 is 748683265, since 4*748683265 % 998244353 = 1)\n\n        Input: 3 -> Output: 748683265 (again 1/4)\n\n        Input: 5 -> Output: 842268673 (which is 5/32 mod 998244353)\n\n        Input: 200000 -> Output: 202370013\n\n   Let me compute the real probabilities for small n:\n\n        n=1: \n            Towns: 0,1,2.\n            We build tower at 1 with probability 1/2.\n            If built, we set power to 1: then it covers [1-1+1, 1+1-1] = [1,1]. \n                Conditions: \n                  Town 0: not covered (ok)\n                  Town 2: not covered (ok)\n                  Town 1: covered by the tower (exactly one) -> ok.\n                So the set S={1} is good.\n\n            If not built, then we cannot cover town1. So only one good set: {1}.\n            Probability = 1/2.\n\n            But wait, the problem says: we build the tower with probability 1/2. So the probability is 1/2.\n\n            However, the example outputs for n=2 and n=3 are 1/4. \n\n            Let me check n=1: \n                The answer should be 1/2. \n\n            But the example input did not include n=1. The sample inputs are n=2, n=3, n=5, and n=200000.\n\n            The problem states: \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the example input includes ['2','3','5','200000'].\n\n            However, note the problem says: \"There are n+2 towns\", so for n=1, we have 3 towns.\n\n            But wait, the example for n=2: \n                Probability 1/4.\n\n            Let me compute for n=2:\n\n                Towns: 0,1,2,3.\n\n                We have two towns (1 and 2) where we build a tower (each with probability 1/2).\n\n                The good sets S:\n\n                    Option 1: S = {1,2}\n                        We can assign:\n                            Tower1: p1=1 -> covers [1,1]\n                            Tower2: p2=1 -> covers [2,2]\n                        Then:\n                            Town0: not covered -> ok.\n                            Town3: not covered -> ok.\n                            Town1: covered by tower1 -> ok.\n                            Town2: covered by tower2 -> ok.\n\n                    Option 2: S = {1} (tower at 1 only)\n                        We set p1=1 -> covers [1,1]. Then town2 is not covered -> fails.\n\n                    Option 3: S = {2} (tower at 2 only)\n                        We set p2=1 -> covers [2,2]. Then town1 is not covered -> fails.\n\n                    Option 4: S = {} -> obviously fails.\n\n                So only the set {1,2} is good. The probability is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4.\n\n            Now for n=3:\n\n                We have towns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\n                We build towers at 1,2,3 independently with prob 1/2.\n\n                Good sets S:\n\n                    Option 1: S = {1,2,3}\n                        We can assign:\n                            p1=1 -> [1,1]\n                            p2=1 -> [2,2]\n                            p3=1 -> [3,3] -> works.\n\n                    Option 2: S = {2} \n                        We set p2=2 -> [2-2+1, 2+2-1] = [1,3] -> then covers towns 1,2,3. \n                            Conditions: \n                                Town0: not covered -> ok.\n                                Town4: not covered -> ok.\n                                Town1: covered by tower2 -> ok.\n                                Town2: covered by tower2 -> ok.\n                                Town3: covered by tower2 -> ok.\n                        So {2} is good.\n\n                    Option 3: S = {1,2}: \n                        We can assign:\n                            p1=1 -> [1,1]\n                            p2=2 -> [0,3] but wait: the condition for the tower at 2: p2=2 -> covers [1,3]. Then town1 is covered by both tower1 and tower2 -> fails.\n\n                        Alternatively, we might assign p1=2: then the tower at 1 covers [1-2+1,1+2-1] = [0,2] -> then covers 0 (which is forbidden) -> invalid.\n\n                    Option 4: S = {1,3}: \n                        We can assign:\n                            p1=1 -> [1,1]\n                            p3=1 -> [3,3]\n                        Then town2 is not covered -> fails.\n\n                    Option 5: S = {1,2,3} already considered.\n\n                    Option 6: S = {2,3}: \n                        We can assign:\n                            p2=1 -> [2,2]\n                            p3=1 -> [3,3]\n                        Then town1 is not covered -> fails.\n\n                        Or p2=2 -> [1,3] and p3=1 -> [3,3]: then town1 is covered by tower2, town2 by tower2, town3 by both -> fails.\n\n                    Option 7: S = {1,2,3} already.\n\n                    Option 8: S = {1,2,3} already.\n\n                    So the good sets are {1,2,3} and {2}. \n\n                    Probability = (probability of {1,2,3}) + (probability of {2})\n                                = (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^1 \n                                = 1/8 + 1/2 = 5/8.\n\n                But wait, the example output for n=3 is 748683265, which is 1/4 mod 998244353. \n\n                However, 5/8 mod 998244353 is not 1/4.\n\n                Let me check: 1/4 mod 998244353 is 748683265, and 5/8 mod 998244353 is:\n\n                    5 * pow(8, -1, 998244353) mod 998244353.\n\n                But the example output for n=3 is 748683265, which is 1/4.\n\n                I must have made a mistake.\n\n                Let me reexamine n=3:\n\n                The condition for n=3: we must cover towns 1,2,3.\n\n                Option: {2} is valid: \n                    Tower2 with power2: covers [2-2+1, 2+2-1] = [1,3] -> covers 1,2,3 -> yes.\n\n                Option: {1,2,3} is valid.\n\n                But wait, are there more?\n\n                What about {1,2}? We tried and it didn't work.\n\n                What about {1,3}? Didn't work.\n\n                What about {2,3}? Didn't work.\n\n                What about {1}? Doesn't cover 2 and 3.\n\n                What about {3}? Doesn't cover 1 and 2.\n\n                So only two sets: {2} and {1,2,3}. \n\n                The probability is (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^1 = 1/8 + 1/2 = 5/8.\n\n                But the example output for n=3 is 748683265, which is 1/4.\n\n                Wait, the example output for n=2 is 748683265 (1/4) and for n=3 is also 748683265 (1/4). \n\n                So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\n                Re-read the problem statement: \"Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\"\n\n                For n=3, the example output is 1/4.\n\n                Why did I get 5/8?\n\n                Let me recount the possibilities for n=3:\n\n                There are 2^3 = 8 possible subsets.\n\n                We found that {2} and {1,2,3} are good.\n\n                But wait, what about {2,1}? No, we already considered {1,2} and {1,2,3}. \n\n                Actually, the set {1,2} is not good, but what about {1,2,3} and {2} and ... ?\n\n                What about {2,3}? We said no. {1,3}? no. {1,2}? no.\n\n                Then why is the answer 1/4? \n\n                Let me read the example explanation for n=3:\n\n                \"The real answer for the second example is 1/4: with probability 1/8, the towers are built in towns 1,2, and 3, so we can set their signal powers to 1; with probability 1/8, only one tower in town 2 is built, and we can set its signal power to 2.\"\n\n                Wait, the example says: \n                    - With probability 1/8: all three are built -> then we can set powers to 1 (or any valid assignment, but they mentioned 1). \n                    - With probability 1/8: only town2 is built -> then set power to 2.\n\n                Then the total probability is 1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4.\n\n                But wait, there is also the set {1,2,3} and {2}. \n\n                Why did the example not mention the set {1,2,3}? Actually, they did: they said \"towers are built in towns 1,2, and 3\". \n\n                But note: the set {1,2,3} has probability 1/8, and {2} has probability 1/8.\n\n                So the example counts these two.\n\n                Then why did I get 5/8 earlier? Because I included {1,2,3} and {2}, but also I thought about {1,2,3} and {2} only. But wait, did I miss some sets?\n\n                The example says: \"with probability 1/8, the towers are built in towns 1,2, and 3\" and \"with probability 1/8, only one tower in town 2 is built\".\n\n                That is two sets: {1,2,3} and {2}. \n\n                But wait, there are other sets that are good? \n\n                Let me check:\n\n                The example says: \"after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers\"\n\n                For n=3, are there other sets?\n\n                Consider the set {1,2,3}: good.\n\n                Consider the set {2}: good.\n\n                Consider the set {1,2}: \n                    We must cover 1,2,3.\n                    If we set tower1 to 1: covers [1,1]; tower2 to 2: covers [0,3] -> invalid because covers 0.\n                    If we set tower1 to 2: covers [0,2] -> invalid because covers 0.\n                    So no.\n\n                Consider the set {1,3}:\n                    We must cover 1,2,3.\n                    Tower1: set to 1 -> covers [1,1]; Tower3: set to 1 -> covers [3,3]; then 2 is missing.\n                    If we set Tower1 to 2: covers [0,2] -> invalid (covers 0) and also covers 2 twice if tower3 is set to 1.\n                    If we set Tower3 to 2: covers [2,4] -> but then 4 is not allowed (n+1=4) -> invalid.\n\n                Consider the set {1,2,3} and {2} are the only ones.\n\n                Then the probability is 2/8 = 1/4.\n\n                Why did I think {1,2,3} was 1/8 and {2} was 1/8, so 2/8 = 1/4.\n\n                So my earlier calculation was correct: the probability is 1/4.\n\n                But wait, why did I initially think that {1,2,3} was the only one and then later added {2}? Actually, I did find two sets.\n\n                So the answer for n=3 is 1/4.\n\n                Now, what is the pattern?\n\n                For n=1: \n                    Good sets: {1} -> probability 1/2.\n\n                For n=2:\n                    Good sets: {1,2} -> probability 1/4.\n\n                For n=3:\n                    Good sets: {1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that, after building radio towers in some towns (each with a probability of 1/2 independently), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower, and each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower. The solution involves analyzing the conditions under which such an assignment is possible and then computing the probability modulo 998244353.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that the set of built towers must form a structure where each segment between consecutive \"critical\" points can be covered without overlapping. Specifically, the solution involves identifying segments where towers must be placed to cover the towns without extending beyond the boundaries (towns 0 and n+1) and ensuring no overlaps.\n2. **Insight**: The valid configurations are those where the set of built towers forms a sequence of intervals that exactly cover [1, n] without overlapping and without covering towns 0 or n+1. This leads to a recurrence relation where the probability for a given n depends on the probabilities for smaller values of n.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use dynamic programming to compute the number of valid subsets of towers for each n. The recurrence relation is derived by considering whether the leftmost tower is included or not, based on the distance from the start of the segment.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each value of n from 1 to the given n, performing constant-time operations for each step. Thus, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the constraint n â‰¤ 2Â·10^5.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    \n    inv2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    dp[1] = 1\n    \n    if n >= 2:\n        dp[2] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD\n    \n    ans = dp[n] * pow(pow(2, n, MOD), MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input value n and initializes necessary variables, including the modular inverse of 2 (inv2) for later calculations.\n2. **Base Cases**: The base cases for n=0, n=1, and n=2 are handled directly. For n=0, the probability is 1 (though not used). For n=1 and n=2, the probabilities are set to 1.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: An array `dp` is initialized where `dp[i]` will store the number of valid subsets for a segment of length i.\n4. **Recurrence Relation**: For each i from 3 to n, `dp[i]` is computed as the sum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`, modulo 998244353. This relation captures the valid configurations by considering whether the current segment can be covered by including or excluding certain towers.\n5. **Probability Calculation**: The result is computed by multiplying the number of valid subsets (`dp[n]`) by the modular inverse of 2^n (the total number of subsets), modulo 998244353.\n6. **Output**: The final result is printed, which is the probability modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired probability by leveraging dynamic programming and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure correctness under the given constraints.",
