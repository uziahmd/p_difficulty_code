Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem requires processing a series of string substitutions on an initial string of digits, and then computing the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n However, note: The total length of all 'ti' in queries is at most 10^5, but the initial string s can be up to 10^5, and we have up to 10^5 queries. But if we try to do each substitution naively (by scanning the entire string for each digit and replacing), the worst-case scenario might be too slow.\n\n Also note: the queries are applied in order, and each query replaces every occurrence of a digit d with a string t. This can lead to exponential growth in the string length? But wait: the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. However, the same digit might be replaced multiple times, and the replacements can be done in any order.\n\n But observe: the problem says that after all queries, we have to compute the number from the resulting string.\n\n Important: The example \"222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7\" -> becomes first 000 then each 0 is replaced by 7, so 777.\n\n However, if we do the first replacement: replace '2' by '0', then the string becomes \"000\". Then the next replacement: replace '0' by '7'. So we get \"777\".\n\n But note: the second replacement applies to the entire string, including the digits that were inserted by the first replacement.\n\n We cannot simply do the replacements one by one because the string length might become very large (even though the total length of all ti is bounded by 10^5, the intermediate steps might be long). However, note the constraint: the sum of lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. But the initial string is up to 10^5, and we are going to do up to 10^5 queries. However, the replacements might chain: we are replacing one digit with a string that may contain digits that will be replaced again.\n\n But note: the problem says that the queries are performed in the given order. And we have to do each replacement for every occurrence of the digit in the current string.\n\n However, doing this naively (by scanning the entire string for each query) would be too slow because the string can grow exponentially in the worst-case.\n\n Alternative approach: we need to process the queries in reverse order? Or use dynamic programming or state machines.\n\n Observation: Each query is independent in terms of the mapping from a digit to a string. But the catch: a later query might change digits that were inserted by an earlier query.\n\n Another observation: the problem is similar to a system of transformations that are applied sequentially. Since we are going to process all queries, we can precompute for each digit (from '0' to '9') what the final transformation should be.\n\n However, note: the queries are in order, so the last query that affects a digit is the one that matters. But wait, consider:\n\n Query 1: 2 -> 00\n Query 2: 0 -> 7\n\n Then, initially, a '2' is replaced by \"00\", and then each '0' in that string is replaced by \"7\", so the '2' becomes \"77\".\n\n Similarly, if we have a digit that appears in the initial string and then is replaced by a string that contains digits that are subject to later queries.\n\n But note: the queries are applied in the order given, so we can process them from last to first and combine the transformations.\n\n Idea: Instead of processing from left to right, we can process from the last query to the first and build a transformation for each digit.\n\n Let's define for each digit d, a function f_d(s) = the string that d is transformed into at the end, taking into account all the queries that occur after the ones that introduced d.\n\n However, the catch: the transformation of a digit d in an early query might be affected by a later query that changes some digit in the replacement string for d.\n\n Alternatively, we can think of it as: each digit in the final string comes from an original digit that was transformed through a sequence of queries. But note: the transformation is sequential and each query replaces every occurrence of a specific digit.\n\n We can use dynamic programming backwards. Let T(d) be the transformation for digit d after processing all queries. Then, when we process a query \"d -> t\", we want to update T(d) to be the transformation that takes the current representation of d and then applies the subsequent queries to the digits in t.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We are going to process the queries in reverse order (from last to first).\n 2. For each digit d, we start with an initial transformation: T(d) = d (the identity).\n 3. When processing a query (in reverse) for digit d0 with string t, then for each digit d in t, we replace d with T(d) (which has been updated by the subsequent queries). Then set T(d0) to be that new string.\n\n However, wait: the queries are applied in the forward order, so the last query is the one that is applied last. Therefore, when we are processing the queries from last to first, we are updating the transformation for the digit in the query to account for the fact that the digits in its replacement string will be transformed by the following (later) queries.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        s = \"2\"\n        Queries: \n            Query1: \"2->00\"\n            Query2: \"0->7\"\n\n   We process queries in reverse order (first Query2, then Query1).\n\n   Step 1 (reverse first): Process Query2: \"0->7\"\n        Now, for digit '0', we set T('0') = \"7\" (because after Query2, the digit '0' becomes \"7\", and there are no queries after Query2 so we just use the replacement).\n\n   Step 2: Process Query1: \"2->00\"\n        Now, the replacement string is \"00\". But now, when we see '0' in \"00\", we use the current T('0') which is \"7\". So the replacement for '2' becomes \"77\".\n\n   Then, the initial string \"2\" is transformed by Query1 (forward) to \"00\", and then Query2 transforms each '0' to \"7\", so we get \"77\".\n\n   But note: the transformation we built for '2' is \"77\", so when we apply the transformation to the initial string, we can simply replace each digit by its final transformation.\n\n However, how do we apply the transformation to the initial string?\n\n   We need to compute the number represented by the transformed string modulo 1000000007.\n\n   But the transformed string might be very long (because the total length of all replacement strings is bounded by 10^5, but the chaining might make the initial string expand to a longer string, but note the constraint: the sum of the lengths of ti for all queries is <= 10^5. However, the intermediate steps might be long, but we are not storing the entire string.\n\n   We cannot build the entire string because the length might be huge (exponential in the worst-case?).\n\n   We must compute the number modulo 1000000007 without building the entire string.\n\n   How to compute the number from a string of digits without building the whole string?\n\n   We can process the string from left to right and keep:\n\n     value: the current value of the number modulo mod\n     power: the current power of 10 (i.e., the multiplier for the next digit)\n\n   But note: the string might have leading zeros. However, the problem says: ignore the leading zeros. But wait: the example \"222\" becomes \"000\" then \"777\", and the answer is 777. So we have to consider that the entire string is the decimal representation, including the zeros at the beginning? Actually, no: the problem says \"ignore the leading zeroes\", meaning that if the string is \"000\", then the number is 0. However, in the example, the transformation \"0->7\" changes the zeros to sevens, so \"000\" becomes \"777\", and that is 777.\n\n   But note: the example input \"1000000008\\n0\" (zero queries) gives output 1. The number 1000000008 mod 1000000007 is 1.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\n   So, we have to account for the entire string, but leading zeros are part of the number only if they are not at the beginning? Actually, the representation is the entire string. But note: the number is formed by concatenating the digits. So \"000\" is the number 0, but \"0000001\" is the number 1.\n\n   However, the example \"3->\" (empty string) for \"123123\": becomes \"1212\", which is 1212. There's no leading zeros issue here because the replacement of '3' by empty string doesn't introduce leading zeros arbitrarily.\n\n   But note: if we have a string that starts with zeros, then the number is the integer represented by that string. For example, \"00123\" represents 123.\n\n   However, the problem does not remove leading zeros arbitrarily. It says: \"ignore the leading zeroes\", meaning that the number is the same as if you removed the leading zeros. But wait, actually the problem says: \"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes\". This means that the entire string is interpreted as a decimal number, so leading zeros are allowed and they are part of the number? Actually, no: the standard interpretation of a decimal number is that leading zeros are ignored. So \"00123\" is 123.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not specify that the string is non-empty. If the string is empty, then the number is 0.\n\n   But the transformation process: we are replacing digits by strings, and the replacement strings are arbitrary (including empty). The resulting string might have leading zeros, but the number is computed by ignoring the leading zeros? Actually, no: the entire string is the decimal representation. The standard rule is that the number is formed by the digits in the usual way, so leading zeros don't add anything. However, if we have an empty string, then the number is 0.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"ignore the leading zeroes\", meaning that the number is the same as if you had a string without the leading zeros. However, if the entire string is zeros, then we have to count the zeros? Actually, no: the standard rule is that the number is the integer value. So \"000\" is 0, and \"00123\" is 123.\n\n   However, note: the example \"222\" with two queries becomes \"777\", and 777 is the number. The transformation does not remove the leading zeros until the end? Actually, the problem says: after all the queries, the resulting string is used to form the number (ignoring the leading zeros).\n\n   But note: the transformation might insert zeros in the middle, and those zeros are meaningful. Only the leading zeros (if the entire string becomes zeros, then we have to consider the entire string as zeros) but the problem says \"ignore the leading zeros\", so if the string is \"000\", then we ignore the leading zeros and the number is 0.\n\n   However, the standard way to compute the number from a string of digits is to interpret the entire string as a base-10 number, which automatically ignores leading zeros. But note: if the string is \"0\", then the number is 0. If the string is \"00\", then the number is 0.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n   Step 1: Precompute the transformation for each digit (from '0' to '9') after processing all queries in reverse order.\n\n   Step 2: Transform the initial string s by replacing each digit d by T(d) (the final transformation string for d).\n\n   Step 3: Compute the number from the transformed string (without building the entire string, because it might be too long) modulo 1000000007.\n\n   However, the transformed string might be extremely long (like 10^5 * 10^5) but note: the total length of all replacement strings (across queries) is bounded by 10^5, and the initial string is up to 10^5. But the chaining: the transformation T(d) might be a string that itself contains digits that are transformed by later queries. But the total length of all T(d) for d in '0'..'9' is bounded by the total length of all ti (which is 10^5) plus the fact that we are replacing digits by their own T(d) (which are built from the subsequent queries). However, note that the reverse processing: we start with T(d)=d and then for each query we replace the digits in the replacement string by the current T(d). \n\n   But the length of T(d) for a digit d might become large. However, note that the total length of the replacement strings for all queries is 10^5, and we are only storing the transformations for 10 digits. But the transformation for a digit d is built from the replacement string and the subsequent transformations. The length of T(d) might be increased by the expansion of each digit in the replacement string.\n\n   However, the problem states that the sum of the lengths of the ti (the replacement strings) is <= 10^5. But note: the reverse processing: we start from the last query and update the transformations. The length of T(d) might grow as we go backwards, but the total expansion is limited by the fact that the entire input (initial string and queries) is bounded.\n\n   But wait: consider if we have a query that replaces a digit d by a string that includes d again. For example:\n        Query1: \"1->11\"\n        Query2: \"1->1\"\n\n        Then, processing in reverse order:\n          Start with T(d)=d for all d.\n          Process Query2: for d='1', T('1') = \"1\" (but wait, the replacement string is \"1\", and then we replace each digit in \"1\" by T(d) (which for '1' is still the old one? Actually, we update T('1') to be the result of replacing each digit in the replacement string by the current T(d) (which is the state after processing the subsequent queries). \n\n        However, the reverse processing: we start from the last query and then update the previous ones. In the example above, we process Query2 first (since it's the last query). Then for d='1', we set T('1') = \"1\" (because the replacement string is \"1\", and then we look up T('1') at that time? But at the time of processing Query2, we haven't processed Query1, so T('1') is still the identity (which is \"1\"). Then we process Query1: for d='1', the replacement string is \"11\", and we replace each digit in \"11\" by T('1') which is \"1\", so we get \"11\" becomes \"11\". Then the transformation for '1' becomes \"11\".\n\n        Now, the initial string \"1\" becomes \"11\", then the number is 11.\n\n        But if we process the forward direction:\n            Query1: replace '1' by \"11\", so \"1\" becomes \"11\".\n            Then Query2: replace '1' by \"1\" in the entire string \"11\", so we get \"11\" -> becomes \"1\" for the first '1' and then the second '1' becomes \"1\", so \"11\" becomes \"11\" (each '1' is replaced by \"1\")? That would be \"11\" -> becomes \"11\", which is 11.\n\n        But wait, the example above: \n            Query2: \"1->1\" doesn't change the string, so the result is the same as if we only did Query1.\n\n        However, the reverse processing must account for the fact that Query2 is applied after Query1. But in the example, the replacement for '1' in Query1 is \"11\", and then in Query2, we replace each '1' in the string by \"1\". So the entire string \"11\" becomes \"11\" (each '1' becomes \"1\", so two '1's become two \"1\"s). \n\n        The reverse processing: we start from the last query (Query2) and set T('1') = \"1\". Then we update Query1: the replacement string for Query1 is \"11\", and we replace each '1' in \"11\" by T('1') (which is \"1\"), so the transformation for Query1 is \"11\". Then, the initial string \"1\" is replaced by \"11\".\n\n        This matches.\n\n   But what about a cycle? Consider:\n        Query1: \"1->2\"\n        Query2: \"2->1\"\n\n        Reverse processing:\n          Start: T(d)=d for all d.\n          Process Query2: for d='2', T('2') = \"1\" (then update)\n          Process Query1: for d='1', T('1') = \"2\", but then we look at the replacement string \"2\", and replace each digit in \"2\" by T('2') (which is \"1\"), so T('1') becomes \"1\".\n\n        Then, the initial string \"1\" becomes \"1\", and the entire transformation is identity.\n\n        Forward: \n          Start with \"1\", apply Query1: becomes \"2\", then apply Query2: becomes \"1\". So the result is \"1\", which matches.\n\n   However, note: the reverse processing uses the updated transformations for the subsequent queries. \n\n   Implementation:\n\n   Let T[0..9] be an array of strings, initially T[d] = str(d) (the string containing the digit d).\n\n   Then, for each query (in reverse order, from last to first) of the form \"d->t\":\n        Let d0 = the digit (a character, say '2')\n        Let t_str = the replacement string (a string of digits, possibly empty)\n\n        Then, for each character c in t_str:\n            Append T[int(c)] to the new transformation string for d0.\n\n        Then set T[d0] = that new string.\n\n   After processing all queries, we have T[d] for each digit d.\n\n   Then, we transform the initial string s: for each character c in s, append T[int(c)].\n\n   But note: the transformed string might be extremely long (the length is the sum of the lengths of T[c] for each c in s). However, the problem constraints say the total length of all replacement strings (the ti) is <= 10^5, but the chaining might lead to a much longer string. However, we cannot build the entire string because the length might be astronomical.\n\n   We must compute the number modulo 1000000007 without building the entire string.\n\n   How to compute the number from a string of digits without building the entire string?\n\n   We can use the idea of processing the entire string from left to right and keeping:\n\n     value = 0\n     base = 1   (current base for the next digit)\n\n   But wait, if we have a string \"123\", we can compute:\n\n        value = ((1 * 10 + 2) * 10 + 3) % mod\n\n   However, the modulus is 1000000007.\n\n   But the transformed string is built by concatenating the transformations of each digit. And the transformation for a digit d is a string, say \"abc\", then the entire string is ... + \"abc\" + ...\n\n   We need to compute the value of the entire string.\n\n   However, the entire string is the concatenation of several parts (each part is the transformation of a digit from the original string). But note: the transformation for a digit d is a string that we built (which itself is the result of replacing each digit in the replacement string by the subsequent transformations). \n\n   But we cannot build the entire string because the length might be too large (exponentially many digits). \n\n   Alternative: we need to compute the value of the concatenated string without building it.\n\n   We can precompute for each digit d (after processing all queries) the following:\n\n        value[d] = the integer value of the string T[d] modulo mod, and \n        len_val[d] = the length of T[d] (so that we know the power of 10 by which we have to multiply the next part)\n\n   But wait: the entire number is the concatenation of the transformations of each digit in the original string.\n\n   How to combine two parts?\n\n        Suppose we have two consecutive digits d1 and d2 in the original string, and we know:\n            value[d1] = v1, and the length of T[d1] is L1.\n            value[d2] = v2, and the length of T[d2] is L2.\n\n        Then, the entire number for the two digits is: v1 * (10^(L2)) + v2.\n\n        Why? Because the first part (T[d1]) is a number that has L1 digits, and then the second part (T[d2]) is appended, so the first part must be shifted by L2 digits.\n\n   Therefore, we can precompute for each digit d:\n\n        val[d]: the value of the final transformation string for d, modulo 1000000007\n        len[d]: the length of the final transformation string for d (in terms of digits)\n\n   Then, we traverse the initial string s from left to right, and for each digit d:\n\n        result = (result * (10^(len[d])) + val[d]) % mod\n\n   But wait: the initial string is being transformed by replacing each digit by its transformation string. The entire transformed string is the concatenation of the transformation strings for each digit in the original string.\n\n   However, note: the transformation T[d] is built from the queries. We have already defined T[d] as the string (without modulus) for the final transformation. But we cannot store the entire string if it is too long.\n\n   Therefore, we must compute for each digit d:\n\n        val[d] = the value of T[d] mod mod\n        len[d] = the length of T[d] (which is the total number of digits in the final transformation)\n\n   How to compute these for each digit?\n\n   We can do the reverse processing not only for the string T[d] but also for the value and the length.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Initially, for each digit d (from '0' to '9'):\n            val[d] = d (as integer) % mod\n            len[d] = 1\n\n        Then, for each query in reverse order (from last to first):\n\n            Let d0 = the digit (say, '2')\n            Let t_str = the replacement string\n\n            Then, we want to compute the new value for d0 and the new length for d0.\n\n            The new transformation for d0 is the concatenation of the transformations for each digit in t_str.\n\n            So, for the value:\n\n                new_val = 0\n                new_len = 0\n\n                For each char c in t_str:\n                    digit = int(c)\n                    new_val = (new_val * (10 ** len[digit])) % mod   # But wait, we are shifting the current new_val by the length of the next part? Actually, no.\n\n            Actually, we are going to build the value from left to right.\n\n            Example: t_str = \"12\", then we first process '1', then '2'.\n\n                Start: new_val = 0, new_len = 0.\n\n                Process '1': \n                    new_val = (0 * (10 ** len['1'])) + val['1'] = val['1']\n                    new_len = new_len + len['1']\n\n                Then process '2':\n                    new_val = (val['1'] * (10 ** len['2'])) + val['2']\n                    new_len = new_len + len['2']\n\n            So, the formula:\n\n                new_val = 0\n                new_len = 0\n                for c in t_str:\n                    d = int(c)\n                    # We are going to append the transformation for d to the current new_val and new_len.\n\n                    # But note: the current new_val is the value of the part we've built so far. Now we append the transformation for d.\n\n                    # The current part we've built (new_val) has new_len digits, so we shift it by the length of the next part (len[d]) and add the value of the next part (val[d]).\n                    new_val = (new_val * pow(10, len[d], mod)) % mod\n                    new_val = (new_val + val[d]) % mod\n                    new_len = (new_len + len[d]) % (mod-1)   # But wait, we are using modulus for exponentiation? We need the actual length for the exponentiation and also for the modulus of the exponent? \n\n            However, the length is used as an exponent in base 10. The exponent (length) might be very large (more than mod). But note: we are only interested in the value modulo mod, and the exponentiation modulo mod can be done with pow(base, exponent, mod). But the exponent (length) can be huge, and we cannot compute 10^(length) mod mod for a length that is, say, 10^18.\n\n            But wait: the length is the total number of digits, and we are storing the length for each digit. However, the length itself might become very large (exponential). We cannot store the exact length as an integer because the length could be astronomical.\n\n            Alternative: we store the value and the length (for the purpose of shifting) modulo something? \n\n            However, note: the shifting operation is: to combine two numbers A (with L1 digits) and B (with L2 digits), the combined value is A * (10^(L2)) + B.\n\n            But the modulus for the value is 1000000007. The shifting exponentiation: we need 10^(L2) mod 1000000007. But L2 (the length) is an integer that might be huge. However, we can use modular exponentiation with modulus 1000000007. But note: the modulus for exponents in modular arithmetic is handled by Euler's theorem, but the exponent L2 might be reduced modulo phi(mod) if we were doing exponents in the exponent, but here we are just computing 10^L2 mod 1000000007. \n\n            However, the modulus for exponentiation is 1000000007, and we can use pow(10, L2, 1000000007). But the problem: if L2 is huge (like 10^18), then we can use pow(10, L2, 1000000007) which uses modular exponentiation and is efficient.\n\n            BUT: the length L2 is stored for each digit. The length is the total number of digits in the transformation for that digit. However, the length itself is the sum of the lengths of the transformations of the digits in the replacement string. And the replacement strings are built from the queries. \n\n            However, the total length of all replacement strings (the ti) is 10^5, so the maximum length for a transformation might be bounded by the total expansion from the initial 10^5 digits? Actually, no: because we have 10 digits, and each query replaces one digit by a string, and the replacement strings are bounded by 10^5 total. But the reverse processing: we start with 1-digit transformations and then expand by replacing each digit in the replacement string by the current transformation (which might be long). The length can become very large.\n\n            Example: a query \"1->11\", then the transformation for '1' becomes \"11\", which is length 2. Then if we have another query \"1->11\", then the transformation becomes \"1111\", length 4, then again \"11111111\", etc. So the length doubles each time. With 10^5 queries, the length would be 2^(number of queries that target '1') which is 2^(10^5) — that's too big.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot store the actual length (as an integer) because it would be too big.\n\n   Alternative approach: we need to compute the value of the entire transformed string without storing the entire string and without storing the entire transformation for each digit (which might be too long).\n\n   We must find a way to compute the value and the length (for shifting) without storing the entire transformation string.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints say the total length of the replacement strings (the ti) is <= 10^5. However, the chaining might lead to a very long string, but we are only asked for the value modulo 1000000007.\n\n   However, the exponent (the length) is needed to compute the shifting. But the shifting exponent is the length of the next part, and the length might be huge. But we can compute the exponentiation modulo 1000000007 using pow(10, exponent, 1000000007) even if the exponent is huge (because of Euler's theorem, we can reduce the exponent modulo the totient of 1000000007). \n\n   But wait: the exponent (length) is used in two ways:\n\n        1. To compute the value: we need to know the length of the next part to shift the current value.\n        2. To compute the value of the next part: we need to know the value of the transformation for each digit, which in turn depends on the length.\n\n   However, the value of a transformation for a digit d is computed by combining the values and the lengths of the digits in its replacement string. And the length of the transformation for d is the sum of the lengths of the transformations of each digit in the replacement string.\n\n   So, we need to compute:\n\n        val[d] = the value of the entire transformation for d (mod 1000000007)\n        len[d] = the total number of digits in the transformation for d (this is used for shifting and also to compute the value of the next parts)\n\n   But the problem: the length might be too big to store as an integer. However, note that the modulus for the exponentiation (1000000007) is fixed, and we can use Euler's theorem to reduce the exponent modulo φ(1000000007) for the exponentiation base 10. But the length is used as an exponent in base 10, and we are only interested in 10^length mod 1000000007.\n\n   Euler's theorem: if 10 and 1000000007 are coprime (they are, since 1000000007 is prime and doesn't divide 10), then 10^k ≡ 10^(k mod φ(mod)) mod mod, where φ(mod) = mod-1.\n\n   So we can store the length modulo (mod-1) for the purpose of exponentiation. However, note: the length is also used to compute the value of the transformation for d. The value of the transformation for d is built by concatenation:\n\n        val[d] = ( ... ( (val[c0] * 10^(len[c1]) + val[c1]) * 10^(len[c2]) + val[c2] ) ... ) mod mod\n\n   But wait, the exponentiation 10^(len[c1]) must be computed modulo mod, and we can do that using pow(10, len_mod, mod) where len_mod = len[c1] % (mod-1) [if we use Euler reduction] but note: Euler reduction requires that the exponent is reduced modulo φ(mod) = mod-1, and then we can use:\n\n        pow(10, exponent, mod) = pow(10, exponent % (mod-1), mod)   [only if exponent >= mod-1? Actually, yes, by Euler's theorem, but note: if exponent is 0 then we don't reduce, and Euler's theorem holds for exponents that are nonnegative integers.\n\n   However, the length (number of digits) is always positive, and we are only interested in the exponentiation for shifting.\n\n   But note: the value computation for a transformation is not linear in the length. We need the actual length to compute the shifting, but the length is used only in the exponentiation (which we can reduce modulo mod-1) and also in the shifting.\n\n   However, the value computation for a transformation is:\n\n        val[d] = 0\n        len_d = 0\n        for each char c in t_str (the replacement string for d):\n            digit = int(c)\n            # Shift the current value by the length of the next part (which is the transformation for digit) and add val[digit]\n            val[d] = (val[d] * pow(10, len[digit], mod)) % mod\n            val[d] = (val[d] + val[digit]) % mod\n            len_d = (len_d + len[digit]) % (mod-1)   # But wait, we are storing the length modulo (mod-1) for the purpose of exponentiation, but is that valid?\n\n   However, the length is used as an exponent in base 10. We are using the property that 10^a * 10^b = 10^(a+b) mod mod, and 10^(a+b) mod mod = (10^a mod mod * 10^b mod mod) mod mod. But the exponents are additive. However, the exponentiation base 10 is periodic with period φ(mod)=1000000006. So we can store the length modulo 1000000006.\n\n   But note: the length is the total number of digits, and we are only using it for exponentiation. So we can store the length modulo (mod-1) for the purpose of exponentiation.\n\n   However, the length is also used in the shifting: the shifting factor is 10^(len[digit]), and we compute that with modular exponentiation. So we don't need the exact length, we only need the length modulo (mod-1) for the exponentiation.\n\n   But wait: the value computation for a transformation d is:\n\n        val[d] = ( ... ( (val[c0] * 10^(len[c1]) + val[c1]) * 10^(len[c2]) + val[c2] ) ... ) mod mod\n\n   And the length of d is the sum of the lengths of c0, c1, c2, etc. (the digits in the replacement string). \n\n   However, the length is used only in the exponentiation. So we can store for each digit d:\n\n        val[d] = the value of the transformation for d (mod 1000000007)\n        len_exp[d] = the length of the transformation for d modulo (1000000006)   [because φ(1000000007)=1000000006]\n\n   Then, when processing a query in reverse order:\n\n        For a query \"d0->t_str\":\n\n            new_val = 0\n            new_len = 0   # but we'll store the exponent (length) modulo 1000000006\n\n            for each char c in t_str:\n                digit = int(c)\n                # Shift the current new_val by the length of the transformation for digit (using len_exp[digit])\n                new_val = (new_val * pow(10, len_exp[digit], mod)) % mod\n                new_val = (new_val + val[digit]) % mod\n                new_len = (new_len + len_exp[digit]) % (mod_phi)   # mod_phi = 1000000006\n\n            Then set val[d0] = new_val, len_exp[d0] = new_len.\n\n   However, wait: the length is the total number of digits, and the exponentiation base 10 uses the entire length (not modulo 1000000006) for the exponent. But by Euler's theorem, we have:\n\n        10^k mod 1000000007 = 10^(k mod 1000000006) mod 1000000007\n\n   So it is correct to reduce the exponent k modulo 1000000006.\n\n   But note: the length is the total number of digits, and when we concatenate, the length is",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of string substitutions on an initial string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the substitutions without explicitly constructing the potentially very large intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible due to exponential growth.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: Instead of processing each query in the given order, we process them in reverse. This allows us to build the final transformation for each digit by considering all subsequent queries, ensuring that each digit's transformation accounts for all later replacements.\n2. **Dynamic Tracking of Transformations**: For each digit (0-9), maintain two pieces of information:\n   - **Value (val)**: The numeric value of the final transformed string for the digit, modulo 1000000007.\n   - **Length (len_exp)**: The total number of digits in the transformed string, modulo 1000000006 (since 1000000007 is prime, Euler's theorem allows exponent reduction modulo 1000000006).\n3. **Efficient Computation**: For each query processed in reverse, update the transformation of the queried digit by combining the transformations of each digit in its replacement string. Use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 1000000007\nmod_phi = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        print(0)\n        return\n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n_line = data[1].strip()\n    n = int(n_line) if n_line else 0\n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        parts = data[i].split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d_str = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((d_str, t_str))\n    \n    val = [0] * 10\n    len_exp = [0] * 10\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        val[i] = i % mod\n        len_exp[i] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n        d_str, t_str = queries[i]\n        if len(d_str) != 1:\n            continue\n        d_digit = int(d_str)\n        new_val = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        \n        for char in t_str:\n            if char == '':\n                continue\n            digit = int(char)\n            new_val = (new_val * pow(10, len_exp[digit], mod)) % mod\n            new_val = (new_val + val[digit]) % mod\n            new_len = (new_len + len_exp[digit]) % mod_phi\n        \n        val[d_digit] = new_val\n        len_exp[d_digit] = new_len\n    \n    result = 0\n    power_shift = 1\n    for char in s:\n        digit = int(char)\n        result = (result * pow(10, len_exp[digit], mod) + val[digit]) % mod\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input. Each query specifies a digit to replace and the replacement string.\n2. **Reverse Processing**: Queries are processed in reverse order. For each query, the transformation of the queried digit is updated by replacing each digit in its replacement string with its current transformed value and length.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The value of the transformed string for each digit is computed using modular arithmetic to keep numbers manageable. The length is stored modulo 1000000006 (Euler's totient of 1000000007) to leverage periodic properties of exponents.\n4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all queries, the initial string `s` is transformed by replacing each digit with its final transformed value. The result is computed by processing each digit's contribution, shifting the current result appropriately, and taking modulo 1000000007 at each step to prevent overflow.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the potentially exponential growth of intermediate strings by leveraging modular arithmetic and reverse processing, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
