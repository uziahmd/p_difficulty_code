Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given R and B (number of rebels and bases) and then R lines for rebels and B lines for bases.\n Since R, B are at most 10, we can use combinatorial methods.\n\n Conditions:\n  - We must assign each base to exactly one rebel and each rebel to exactly one base (perfect matching).\n  - The straight paths (from base to its assigned spaceship) must not intersect (in the galaxy plane).\n\n Important: The problem does not require that the entire set of points is in general position (except no three collinear and no two coincide) but note that we have two sets: rebels and bases.\n\n However, note: the condition is that the straight paths (the line segments) do not intersect. But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths from a base to its assigned spaceship\" do not intersect. This means that the matching must be such that the drawn edges (from base to its matched rebel) do not cross.\n\n Observation:\n  In the plane, non-intersecting straight-line matchings are similar to planar graphs. But note: we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily. However, the problem states that the assignment is a perfect matching (so |R| = |B|) and we are matching rebels (one set) to bases (another set). Actually, note: the input has R rebels and B bases, and we need a perfect matching (so we require R == B). But the problem says: \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\", and \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So implicitly, we must have R == B.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. If R != B, then there is no perfect matching? Actually, the problem says: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So if R != B, we cannot have a perfect matching. But note: the example input has first example: 3 3, so R=B=3. Second example: 2 1 -> R=2, B=1, so clearly no perfect matching.\n\n Therefore, if R != B, we output 'No'.\n\n 2. But wait, the problem says: \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian\". So yes, we must have R == B.\n\n However, note: the problem statement says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and the example input format. So the input has two integers R and B, and then R lines for rebels and B lines for bases. The example inputs are:\n\n   Example 1: \"3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2\"\n   Example 2: \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\"\n\n So for the second example, R=2, B=1 -> not equal, so no perfect matching.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If it is possible to connect ...\", so if R != B, we don't even try to form a matching? Actually, the condition of perfect matching requires that the two sets have the same size.\n\n Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Read R and B.\n   Step 2: If R != B, output \"No\".\n   Step 3: Else, read the next R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n However, wait: the example input format: \n        First line: \"3 3\"\n        Then 3 lines for rebels (spaceships)\n        Then 3 lines for bases.\n\n   But note: the example input string is given as: \n        ['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n   So the second example is: \n        First line: \"2 1\"\n        Then 2 lines for rebels: [1,0] and [2,2]\n        Then 1 line for base: [3,1]\n\n   So our code should read:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().strip().splitlines()\n        first_line = data[0].split()\n        R = int(first_line[0]); B = int(first_line[1])\n\n   Then, read next R lines for rebels, then next B lines for bases.\n\n 3. Now, we have two sets: \n        Rebels: list of R points (x_i, y_i)\n        Bases: list of B points (x_j, y_j)\n\n 4. We wish to know if there exists a bijection f from Rebels to Bases such that the edges (from base j to rebel i, but wait: actually the path is from base to its assigned spaceship? \n\n    Note: the problem says: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect\".\n\n    So the edges are from base to rebel. But note: the rebels are one set and bases are the other. So we are matching a base to a rebel. The edge is from the base to the rebel.\n\n    However, the example: \n        Input: 3 3\n        Rebels: [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n        Bases: [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\n    How to assign? The example says: \"one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order\". \n\n    Let me assume the example assignment is:\n        Base (-2,1) to Rebel (0,0) -> edge from (-2,1) to (0,0)\n        Base (0,3) to Rebel (2,0) -> edge from (0,3) to (2,0)\n        Base (2,2) to Rebel (3,1) -> edge from (2,2) to (3,1)\n\n    Now, check if these edges intersect.\n\n    We can check for edge intersections by writing a function.\n\n    But note: the problem says the entire assignment must have non-intersecting edges.\n\n    However, note: the edges are drawn from base to rebel. The rebels and bases are distinct sets. Also, the problem states that no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry about degenerate cases.\n\n    But wait: what if an edge passes through a third point? The condition is about the edges (line segments) intersecting. The problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" meaning two edges.\n\n    So we must check for any two edges (that are not sharing an endpoint) not crossing.\n\n    However, note: the edges are between two sets. There are two possibilities: the edges might share endpoints (they do, by definition, because each edge connects a base and a rebel, and they are distinct). But the condition says \"paths\" from base to its assigned spaceship. So we consider two distinct edges (i.e., two different bases) and their connecting edges.\n\n    How to check for non-intersecting edges?\n\n    We can use the following idea:\n\n        We are to assign rebels (set A) to bases (set B) and draw edges from base to rebel.\n\n        Condition: The edges must not cross.\n\n    This is equivalent to drawing a planar graph with edges only between the two sets. And since the two sets are disjoint, this is a bipartite graph.\n\n    There is a well-known fact: a bipartite graph drawing (with two sets in convex position) can be drawn without crossings if and only if the matching is non-crossing. However, our two sets are not necessarily in convex position.\n\n    Alternate approach:\n\n        We can use the following: \n            Sort all the points (both rebels and bases) by x-coordinate (and then by y-coordinate if necessary) and then check if the matching is non-crossing.\n\n        But note: the edges are from base to rebel. We are free to choose the matching.\n\n        However, the problem is: does there exist a matching such that the edges do not cross?\n\n        Steps:\n\n          a. Check if R != B -> No.\n\n          b. Otherwise, we have to check if there is a non-crossing perfect matching between the two sets.\n\n        How to check for the existence of a non-crossing matching?\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n          - Consider the two sets of points. We can merge the two sets and sort by x (and then by y, or use a key that breaks ties appropriately). Then, the non-crossing matching in a bipartite graph for two sets in the plane (without three collinear) is similar to matching parentheses or non-crossing partitions.\n\n        However, note: the two sets are distinct (rebels and bases) and the edges are only from bases to rebels.\n\n        Idea: \n\n          We can consider the following: \n\n          Step 1: Combine the two sets and sort by x-coordinate (if two points have the same x, then sort by y). But note: we have two types: rebels and bases.\n\n          Step 2: We traverse the sorted list and whenever we see a base, we know that the next rebel (if we are to form a matching) must be the next one (in the sorted order) to avoid crossing? \n\n        Actually, consider: \n\n          We want to match the bases to the rebels. The non-crossing condition is similar to matching parentheses: if we have a base and then a rebel, then the next base must be matched to the next rebel (if we are going to avoid crossing). \n\n        But wait, let's think: \n\n          Suppose we have two bases and two rebels. The sorted order (by x) is:\n\n            base1, base2, rebel1, rebel2\n\n          Then if we connect base1 to rebel1 and base2 to rebel2, the edges do not cross. But if we connect base1 to rebel2 and base2 to rebel1, then the edges cross.\n\n        Therefore, the matching must be such that the relative orders of the bases and rebels in the sorted order (by x) must be preserved.\n\n        More precisely, if we consider the entire set of points (merging the two sets) and we mark which is base and which is rebel, then the matching is non-crossing if and only if:\n\n          When we go from left to right, we never have an unmatched base that is connected to a rebel that appears to the left of the current base's potential connection.\n\n        Actually, the standard way to draw non-crossing bipartite matchings is to use the following:\n\n          Sort the bases and rebels independently by x (and then by y). Then, if we match the leftmost base to the leftmost rebel, the next base to the next rebel, etc., then the edges will not cross.\n\n        But wait, is that sufficient? \n\n          Example: \n            Bases: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]\n            Rebels: [ (1,1), (3,1) ]\n\n          Sort by x: bases: [(0,0), (2,0)] and rebels: [(1,1), (3,1)]\n\n          Matching: base (0,0) to rebel (1,1) and base (2,0) to rebel (3,1): \n            Edge1: (0,0) to (1,1)\n            Edge2: (2,0) to (3,1)\n\n          These edges do not cross.\n\n          Now, what if we swap the rebels?\n            Matching: base (0,0) to rebel (3,1) and base (2,0) to rebel (1,1):\n            Edge1: (0,0) to (3,1)\n            Edge2: (2,0) to (1,1)\n\n          Now, check if they cross: \n            The two segments: (0,0)-(3,1) and (2,0)-(1,1)\n\n          The segment (0,0)-(3,1) goes from (0,0) to (3,1) and (2,0)-(1,1) goes from (2,0) to (1,1). These two segments do cross.\n\n        So the matching must preserve the order: if we sort the bases and the rebels by x, then we must match the i-th smallest base to the i-th smallest rebel.\n\n        However, what if the bases and rebels are interleaved differently?\n\n        Example: \n          Bases: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]\n          Rebels: [ (1,1), (3,1) ] -> same as above.\n\n        But what if we have:\n\n          Bases: [ (0,0), (1,0) ]\n          Rebels: [ (0,1), (2,1) ]\n\n          Matching by order: \n            base (0,0) to rebel (0,1): edge from (0,0) to (0,1) [vertical]\n            base (1,0) to rebel (2,1): edge from (1,0) to (2,1)\n\n          They don't cross.\n\n        What if we have:\n\n          Bases: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]\n          Rebels: [ (1,1), (3,1) ]\n\n          Matching by order: non-crossing.\n\n        But what if we have:\n\n          Bases: [ (0,0), (1,0) ]\n          Rebels: [ (0.5,1), (1.5,1) ]\n\n          Matching by order: base (0,0) to (0.5,1) and base (1,0) to (1.5,1): non-crossing.\n\n        However, what if we have:\n\n          Bases: [ (0,0), (2,0) ]\n          Rebels: [ (1,1), (3,1) ]\n\n          and we match base (0,0) to (3,1) and base (2,0) to (1,1): crossing.\n\n        So the condition is: we must match the bases in increasing x to rebels in increasing x.\n\n        But wait: what if the bases and rebels have the same x? The problem says: no two points coincide and no three points are on the same line. So same x is allowed? Then we break tie by y.\n\n        However, the problem says: |xi|,|yi|<=10000, and no two points coincide. So same x is allowed as long as y differs.\n\n        So we must sort by x, and if x is the same, then by y.\n\n        But note: what if the bases and rebels are not aligned in the same way in terms of y? \n\n        Actually, the matching by sorted order (base_i to rebel_i) is always non-crossing? \n\n        Let me test with two bases and two rebels:\n\n          Bases: [ (0,0), (0,1) ]  -> same x, different y.\n          Rebels: [ (1,0), (1,1) ] -> same x, different y.\n\n          Sort by x: both bases have x=0, then by y: base (0,0) then (0,1). Similarly, rebels: (1,0) then (1,1).\n\n          Matching: base (0,0) to (1,0) and base (0,1) to (1,1): \n            Edges: (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1): these are two horizontal edges? Actually, from (0,0) to (1,0) is horizontal, and (0,1) to (1,1) is also horizontal. They don't cross.\n\n          Now, if we swap the rebels: base (0,0) to (1,1) and base (0,1) to (1,0): \n            Edges: (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,1)-(1,0). These are two diagonals that cross.\n\n        So the condition is: we must match the bases in increasing x (and increasing y if x is same) to the rebels in increasing x (and increasing y if x is same). \n\n        However, note: the entire set of points (bases and rebels) must be considered together? Or separately?\n\n        Actually, the standard non-crossing bipartite matching in a plane is achieved by matching the base and rebel in the same order when we sort the bases and the rebels by x (and then y) independently.\n\n        But wait, what if we have:\n\n          Bases: [ (0,0), (1,1) ]\n          Rebels: [ (0,1), (1,0) ]\n\n          Sort bases by x: [ (0,0), (1,1) ]\n          Sort rebels by x: [ (0,1), (1,0) ]\n\n          Matching: base (0,0) to (0,1) and base (1,1) to (1,0): \n            Edge1: (0,0) to (0,1) [vertical]\n            Edge2: (1,1) to (1,0) [vertical] -> they don't cross.\n\n          Now, if we match base (0,0) to (1,0) and base (1,1) to (0,1): \n            Edge1: (0,0) to (1,0) [horizontal]\n            Edge2: (1,1) to (0,1) [horizontal] -> they don't cross? Actually, wait: \n                (0,0) to (1,0) is from (0,0) to (1,0) and (1,1) to (0,1) is from (1,1) to (0,1). These two edges do not share an endpoint and they are two horizontal lines at y=0 and y=1, so they don't cross.\n\n          But wait, are these two matchings valid? \n\n          Actually, the matching by independent sorting of the two sets (by x) gives the first matching: \n            base (0,0) -> (0,1) and base (1,1) -> (1,0)\n\n          But the second matching is: base (0,0) -> (1,0) and base (1,1) -> (0,1)\n\n          How do we decide which matching is the one that avoids crossing? \n\n          Actually, the condition for non-crossing is more subtle.\n\n        Alternate insight:\n\n          Consider the entire set of points (bases and rebels) and sort them by x (and then by y). Then, we traverse from left to right. We have two pointers: one for bases and one for rebels. But note: the edges are from base to rebel.\n\n          We can use a greedy method: \n\n            Sort all points (both bases and rebels) by x (and then y). Then, we traverse the sorted list and whenever we encounter a base, we match it to the next available rebel (which is the next point in the sorted list that is a rebel) if that rebel hasn't been taken. But wait, what if the next available rebel is not the very next one? \n\n          Actually, we can use the following:\n\n            We are going to simulate the entire set of points (all points) and whenever we see a base, we match it to the next rebel (in the sorted order) that hasn't been matched yet. But then we must ensure that the edges do not cross.\n\n          However, note: if we have:\n\n            Points (sorted by x): [base, base, rebel, rebel] -> then matching the first base to the first rebel and the second base to the second rebel is non-crossing.\n\n          But what if the sorted order is: [base, rebel, base, rebel]? \n\n            Then if we match the first base (at index0) to the first rebel (index1) and then the next base (index2) to the next rebel (index3), then the edges are (base0, rebel1) and (base2, rebel3). These edges might not cross because base0 is left of base2 and rebel1 is left of rebel3.\n\n          However, what if the sorted order is: [base, base, rebel, rebel] but the two bases are at the same x? Then the sorting by x and then y: \n\n            [base1 (same x, lower y), base2 (same x, higher y), rebel1 (same x, lower y?), rebel2]\n\n          Wait, but we have two sets. So we cannot mix the two sets arbitrarily.\n\n        Standard solution for non-crossing bipartite matching:\n\n          We can use the following algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Sort all bases by x (and then by y).\n          Step 2: Sort all rebels by x (and then by y).\n          Step 3: Check if for every i, the i-th base (in sorted order) and the i-th rebel (in sorted order) form edges that do not cross.\n\n          But wait, that is just one matching (the one that matches base_i to rebel_i). However, we are allowed to choose any matching.\n\n          However, there is a known fact: In a set of two points (from two sets) the non-crossing matching is unique if we fix the order of the two sets? Actually, no: the matching by sorted order (base_i to rebel_i) is the non-crossing matching that uses the \"greedy\" method. But there might be multiple non-crossing matchings.\n\n        Actually, the problem is: does there exist any non-crossing matching?\n\n        We can use a recursive backtracking? But R, B <= 10, so we could in theory generate all permutations (10! = 3628800) which is acceptable for n=10? Actually, 10 is the maximum, so 10! is about 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Python if we do it smartly.\n\n        However, we can use a more efficient method.\n\n        Another idea: \n\n          We can use the following necessary and sufficient condition:\n\n          For the bipartite matching to be non-crossing, the following must hold:\n\n            For any four distinct points (a,b) from the two sets (a and b from one set, say base; c and d from the other set, say rebel) such that a.x < b.x and c.x < d.x, we must have that the matching does not assign a to d and b to c.\n\n          In other words, the matching must preserve the order: if a base a is to the left of base b, then the rebel assigned to a must be to the left of the rebel assigned to b.\n\n          But note: the rebels are fixed in the plane, so we can pre-sort the rebels by x.\n\n          Then, the condition is: the matching must be order-preserving (when both sets are sorted by x). \n\n          However, what if the bases are not sorted by x? We can sort the bases by x and then the rebels by x, and then check if the matching (which is a permutation) is increasing in the index of the rebels.\n\n          Actually, we can re-index the rebels so that they are sorted by x. Then, we require that the rebels assigned to the bases (in increasing base x) must be in increasing order of their x (or y?).\n\n          But wait, the condition is about the edges not crossing. The standard way to check for non-crossing is to use the \"monotone\" matching: match the i-th base (in sorted order) to the i-th rebel (in sorted order). \n\n          However, is that the only non-crossing matching? \n\n          Consider: \n\n            Bases: [A, B] (A.x < B.x)\n            Rebels: [C, D] (C.x < D.x)\n\n          Then the matching A->C and B->D is non-crossing.\n\n          The matching A->D and B->C is crossing.\n\n          Now, what if we have three points? \n\n          Example: \n            Bases: [A, B, C] (A.x < B.x < C.x)\n            Rebels: [D, E, F] (D.x < E.x < F.x)\n\n          Then the matching A->D, B->E, C->F is non-crossing.\n\n          Now, is there another non-crossing matching? \n\n          Consider: A->D, B->F, C->E: \n            This would be: \n              A->D, B->F, C->E.\n\n          Now, check: \n            The edges: \n              A-D, B-F, C-E.\n\n          Now, the edge B-F and C-E: \n            Since B.x < C.x and F.x > E.x, then the edge from B to F and from C to E might cross.\n\n          How to check: \n\n            We have two edges: (B, F) and (C, E). \n            Condition for crossing: \n              (B.x < C.x < F.x and E.y < B.y < F.y) OR something? Actually, we can use the standard segment intersection check.\n\n          But note: the two edges (B-F) and (C-E) do not necessarily cross if the points are arranged in a particular way.\n\n          Actually, the condition for two segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) to cross is that the points p1, p2 lie on opposite sides of the line q1q2 and vice versa.\n\n          However, we are not required to find the matching, only to check existence.\n\n        Given the small constraints (n<=10), we can do:\n\n          Step 1: If R != B, output \"No\".\n\n          Step 2: Read the points.\n\n          Step 3: Sort the bases by x (and then y) and the rebels by x (and then y).\n\n          Step 4: Now, note: the matching that matches the i-th base to the i-th rebel (in sorted order) is one candidate. But there might be others.\n\n          However, there is a theorem: the non-crossing bipartite matching exists if and only if there exists a non-crossing matching, and one way to get one is to use the \"greedy\" matching (matching the sorted bases to sorted rebels). But wait, is that true?\n\n          Actually, the greedy matching (matching sorted bases to sorted rebels) is always non-crossing? \n\n          Let me test with the example above with three points:\n\n            Bases: [A, B, C] (x-coordinates: 0,1,2)\n            Rebels: [D, E, F] (x-coordinates: 0,2,3) -> wait, then sorted rebels: D(0), E(2), F(3). Then matching: A->D, B->E, C->F.\n\n            Now, check the edges: \n              A(0) to D(0) -> vertical? \n              B(1) to E(2) -> from (1,?) to (2,?)\n              C(2) to F(3) -> from (2,?) to (3,?)\n\n            Now, if we change the rebels: \n                Rebels: [D(0), E(3), F(2)] -> then sorted: D(0), F(2), E(3). Then matching: A->D, B->F, C->E.\n\n            Now, edges: A->D, B->F, C->E.\n\n            Check if they cross: \n                Edge1: A-D (from base A to D)\n                Edge2: B-F (from base B to F)\n                Edge3: C-E (from base C to E)\n\n            Now, check for crossing between Edge1 and Edge2: they don't share endpoints and are from A (leftmost base) to D (leftmost rebel) and B (middle base) to F (middle rebel). \n            Similarly, Edge2 and Edge3: B to F and C to E. \n\n            We have to check if (B-F) and (C-E) cross.\n\n            Conditions for two segments (B-F) and (C-E) to cross:\n\n            Let B = (1, y1), F = (2, y2) -> wait, the rebels are sorted by x: D(0), F(2), E(3). So the rebels' y coordinates? Actually, we don't know, so we have to use the actual coordinates.\n\n            But note: the problem says no three points are collinear, but we don't know the y's.\n\n            We must check for segment intersection.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the following known fact: \n\n            In a set of two sets of points (no three collinear) the non-crossing bipartite matching exists if and only if the following holds: \n\n            For any two bases a, b (with a.x < b.x) and two rebels c, d (with c.x < d.x), if we assign a to d and b to c, then the edges (a-d) and (b-c) must cross. Therefore, we must avoid such assignments.\n\n          However, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n            Generate all perfect matchings (permutations of size R for the bases to rebels) and check for each if the edges do not cross.\n\n          But note: R, B <= 10, so the number of perfect matchings is R! (which is up to 10! = 3628800). This is acceptable in C++ but in Python we must be careful.\n\n          However, 10! is about 3.6 million, which is acceptable in Python if we do it efficiently.\n\n          Steps for checking a matching:\n\n            We have a permutation p of [0, R-1] such that base i is matched to rebel p[i].\n\n            Then, we have R edges: from base i to rebel p[i] (for i in range(R)).\n\n            We need to check that no two edges (i and j) cross.\n\n          How to check if two edges (i and j) cross?\n\n            We have two edges: (base_i, rebel_i) and (base_j, rebel_j)\n\n            The two edges cross if and only if the two segments intersect and they are not the same segment.\n\n            Conditions for two segments (A,B) and (C,D) to intersect (proper intersection, not at endpoints) is not exactly what we need: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" do not intersect. So including endpoints? \n\n            But note: the endpoints are distinct (because the sets are disjoint) and the edges are from base to rebel. So the endpoints are distinct. However, two edges might share an endpoint? \n\n            Actually, the edges are from base to rebel, and the base set and rebel set are disjoint. So the endpoints of two different edges are distinct. Therefore, the edges only share endpoints if the matching assigns the same point to two different edges? But wait, the matching is one-to-one. So the endpoints are distinct.\n\n            However, two edges might share an endpoint if the matching is such that two edges share a base or a rebel? But no: each base is used once and each rebel is used once.\n\n            Therefore, the edges are disjoint in endpoints.\n\n            Now, the condition for two segments (A,B) and (C,D) (with A, B, C, D distinct) to cross is:\n\n                (A.x < C.x < B.x and D.y between A.y and B.y) OR (C.x < A.x < B.x and D.y between A.y and B.y) ... \n\n            Actually, we can use the standard orientation test.\n\n            We can use the cross product method.\n\n            Two segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect if and only if:\n\n                (p1, q1, p2) are not collinear and (p1, q1, q2) are not collinear, and \n                (p2 is on one side of the line p1q1 and q2 is on the opposite side) and vice versa.\n\n            More precisely, we can define:\n\n                def ccw(A, B, C):\n                    return (C[0]-A[0])*(B[1]-A[1]) > (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1])\n\n                Then, the segments AB and CD intersect if and only if \n                    (ccw(A, B, C) != ccw(A, B, D)) and (ccw(C, D, A) != ccw(C, D, B))\n\n            However, note: if the segments are not proper (like overlapping) but the problem says no three points are collinear, so we don't have to worry about collinearity.\n\n            But wait: the segments might be defined by two sets: base and rebel. The four points are distinct and no three collinear, so the above condition is sufficient.\n\n          Therefore, for a given matching (represented by a permutation p of length R, where we match base i to rebel p[i]), we can:\n\n            For i in range(R):\n                For j in range(i+1, R):\n                    Let A = base_i, B = rebel_p[i], C = base_j, D = rebel_p[j]\n                    Check if the segment (A,B) and (C,D) intersect.\n\n            If we find any pair (i,j) that intersects, then this matching is invalid.\n\n          Then, if we find at least one matching that does not have any crossing, we output \"Yes\", otherwise \"No\".\n\n        However, generating all permutations (R! possibilities) and for each permutation checking O(R^2) intersections (each using a constant-time check) would be O(R! * R^2). \n\n        The worst-case R=10, then 10! * 10^2 = 3628800 * 100 = 362880000, which is about 363 million checks. Each check is a few arithmetic operations. \n\n        In Python, 363 million operations might take a few seconds (if each operation is a few cycles, say 10 cycles per check, then 3.63e9 cycles, and a typical CPU does about 1e9 cycles per second, so about 3.6 seconds). This is acceptable for a competition problem? \n\n        But note: the problem says R, B from 1 to 10. So worst-case 10.\n\n        However, we can optimize by breaking early: as soon as we find one non-crossing matching, we can output \"Yes\" and exit.\n\n        Also, we can use symmetry: if we have already checked many matchings, but worst-case we might have to check all.\n\n        But 10! is 3.6e6, and for each we do 45 (n=10, so C(10,2)=45) checks, so 3.6e6 * 45 = 162e6, which is 162 million checks. \n\n        Actually, for each matching, we do:\n\n            for i in range(10):\n                for j in range(i+1, 10):\n\n            That is 45 pairs per matching.\n\n        So total operations: 3628800 * 45 = 163296000, which is 163 million.\n\n        Each check (for one pair) involves two ccw() calls (each ccw is 4 multiplications and some subtractions). \n\n        But note: the condition for two segments (A,B) and (C,D) is:\n\n            if (ccw(A, B, C) != ccw(A, B, D)) and (ccw(C, D, A) != ccw(C, D, B)):\n                then they intersect.\n\n        So two ccw() calls for the first condition, and two for the second.\n\n        Total operations per pair: 8 multiplications and several additions/subtractions.\n\n        163 million * 8 = 1.3 billion multiplications. \n\n        In Python, this might be slow, but let's hope that the input sizes are small (worst-case 10) and the numbers are integers (so fast).\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a more efficient representation and hope that the test cases are not worst-case.\n\n        But note: the problem says R, B from 1 to 10. Worst-case is 10.\n\n        However, we can use memoization? Not really, because the matching is a permutation.\n\n        Another idea: we can use dynamic programming with bitmasks? But R=10, so state space is 2^10 = 1024, but then we have to check for non-crossing condition during the DP? \n\n        Actually, we can use the following: \n\n          We sort the bases and rebels by x (and then y) and then use DP that considers the convex hull property? \n\n        But the problem does not require the matching to be the one that is order-preserving. However, we can use the following:\n\n          Theorem: A non-crossing bipartite matching exists if and only if there exists a matching that is non-crossing.\n\n          And we can use the following algorithm:\n\n            Sort the bases by x (and then y).\n            Sort the rebels by x (and then y).\n\n            Then, we wish to know if there exists a non-crossing matching. \n\n          We can use a greedy matching: \n\n            We consider the bases in increasing x. For the first base, we can match it to any rebel that is not blocked by the condition. But the condition is global.\n\n        After research, I recall that non-crossing bipartite matching can be found by:\n\n          Sort the bases and rebels by x (and then y). Then, the matching is non-crossing if and only if we can match the i-th base to a rebel with x >= the i-th base's x (in the sorted order) and then use a stack-like structure.\n\n        Actually, there is a known greedy algorithm for non-crossing matching in two sets: \n\n          Step 1: Sort bases by x (and then y).\n          Step 2: Sort rebels by x (and then y).\n          Step 3: Traverse the bases from left to right. For the current base, we consider all rebels to the right (in x) that",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and a set of bases such that the straight-line paths connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between the bases and spaceships to see if any permutation satisfies the non-intersecting condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a perfect matching (a bijection) between two sets of points (bases and spaceships) such that no two connecting line segments intersect. The key observation is that the assignment must be a permutation where the line segments between the matched points do not cross.\n2. **Intuition**: Given the constraints (R and B are at most 10), a brute-force approach is feasible. We generate all possible permutations of assignments between the bases and spaceships and check each permutation for non-intersecting line segments.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Permutation Generation**: Use itertools.permutations to generate all possible ways to assign bases to spaceships.\n   - **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, check every pair of line segments to see if they intersect using the cross product method (ccw function).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The number of permutations for R=10 is 10! (3,628,800). For each permutation, we check C(10,2) = 45 pairs of segments. Each intersection check involves a constant-time computation using the cross product. The total operations are manageable within the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) > (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    if not (ccw(a, b, c) ^ ccw(a, b, d)):\n        return False\n    if not (ccw(c, d, a) ^ ccw(c, d, b)):\n        return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    R = int(first_line[0])\n    B = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    rebels = []\n    bases = []\n    \n    index = 1\n    for i in range(R):\n        coords = data[index].split()\n        index += 1\n        x = int(coords[0])\n        y = int(coords[1])\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    for i in range(B):\n        coords = data[index].split()\n        index += 1\n        x = int(coords[0])\n        y = int(coords[1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    if R == 0:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        return\n        \n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(R)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            a = bases[i]\n            b = rebels[perm[i]]\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                c = bases[j]\n                d = rebels[perm[j]]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, parsing the number of Rebels (R) and Bases (B). The subsequent lines contain the coordinates of the Rebels and Bases.\n2. **Initial Checks**: If the number of Rebels and Bases are not equal, output \"No\" immediately since a perfect matching is impossible. If both sets are empty, output \"Yes\".\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the Rebels list, the code checks if the line segments connecting each Base to its assigned Rebel in the permutation do not intersect. The `segments_intersect` function uses the cross product (ccw) to determine if two segments intersect.\n4. **Output Result**: If any permutation is found where all line segments do not intersect, output \"Yes\"; otherwise, output \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible assignments by leveraging permutations and a geometric intersection check, ensuring correctness within the problem constraints.",
