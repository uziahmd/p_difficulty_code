Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add some cards (each card's value between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] for the additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n  We want the minimum number of cards. So we want to use as few cards as possible to get a total of -S.\n\n 4. Consider:\n    - If S == 0, then we don't need any additional cards -> answer 0.\n\n 5. Otherwise, we have to make up the difference D = -S (so we need to add numbers that sum to D).\n\n 6. Since each card can be at most x (or at least -x), we can think:\n\n    Case 1: If D is positive (meaning we need to add positive numbers to increase the sum to zero)\n        Then we can use as many cards as needed, each card at most x, so the minimum number of cards required is ceil(D / x)\n\n    Case 2: If D is negative (meaning we need to add negative numbers to decrease the sum to zero)\n        Similarly, the minimum number of cards is ceil(|D| / x) [but note: if D is negative, then |D| = -D]\n\n 7. However, wait: what if we can mix positive and negative? Actually, note: we are allowed to choose any integers from -x to x.\n\n    But note: we are trying to minimize the number of cards. The best way is to use the maximum absolute value per card.\n\n    However, consider: \n        Example 1: Current sum S = 1, x = 2. Then D = -1. We can use one card with -1 (which is in [-2,2]) -> so answer 1.\n\n        Example 2: Current sum S = 3, x = 2. Then D = -3. We cannot do it with one card (because the smallest negative is -2, which is not enough). \n                    With two cards: we can use two -2's: -2 + (-2) = -4, which is less than -3. Alternatively, we might use a combination? \n                    But note: we are allowed to use any integers. We can use one card of -1 and one card of -2: that's two cards and gives -3. \n                    However, wait: the problem says we can choose any integer from -x to x. So we can also choose 0? But 0 doesn't help.\n\n        Actually, the minimal number of cards is determined by the fact that we want to cover the deficit D (which is negative) and we can use at most -x per card (if we use negative) or positive if we have a positive deficit.\n\n    However, note: the problem does not require that we only use negative or positive. But observe: if we have a positive deficit (D positive), then using negative cards would only make the deficit worse. Similarly, if we have a negative deficit, positive cards would make it worse. Therefore, we should only use the appropriate sign.\n\n    So the plan:\n\n      Let D = - (current sum)\n\n      If D == 0: 0.\n\n      Else if D > 0:\n          We need to add positive cards. Each card can contribute at most x (so we need at least ceil(D / x) cards).\n\n      Else (D < 0):\n          We need to add negative cards. Each card can contribute at most -x (so we need to cover a deficit of |D|, and each card can remove at most x). Therefore, the number of cards is ceil(|D| / x).\n\n    BUT wait: Example 2 above: S=3, x=2 -> D=-3, |D|=3, then ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> correct.\n\n    However, let's test with another example: \n        Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, and the two cards are [-2,-2]. \n        Sum S = -4, so D = 4.\n        Then we need ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.33) = 2. So output 2.\n\n    This matches the sample.\n\n    BUT wait:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on his cards equals zero. Each card can have any integer value from -x to x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be zero after adding some number of cards. The additional cards can have values ranging from -x to x. The solution involves calculating the deficit (or surplus) from the current sum to reach zero and then determining the minimum number of cards required to cover this deficit or surplus.\n2. **Insight**: \n   - If the current sum is already zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - If the current sum is positive, the deficit is the negative of the sum. We need to cover this deficit using the maximum possible negative value per card (-x). The number of cards required is the ceiling of the absolute deficit divided by x.\n   - Similarly, if the current sum is negative, the deficit is the absolute value of the sum. We cover this deficit using the maximum possible positive value per card (x), again requiring the ceiling of the deficit divided by x.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves straightforward arithmetic operations—calculating the total sum, determining the deficit, and computing the ceiling of the division of the deficit by x. This approach efficiently addresses the problem with minimal computational steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    cards = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(cards)\n    deficit = -total_sum\n    \n    if deficit == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        num_cards = abs(deficit) / x\n        result = (num_cards).__ceil__()\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers (n and x) followed by a list of n integers representing the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. This sum determines whether additional cards are needed.\n3. **Deficit Calculation**: The deficit is the value needed to make the total sum zero. If the current sum is positive, the deficit is negative, and vice versa.\n4. **Card Count Calculation**: The number of additional cards required is the ceiling of the absolute deficit divided by x. This is because each card can contribute at most ±x towards covering the deficit.\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the minimum number of cards needed to achieve a zero sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging basic arithmetic and ensures optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of found cards.",
