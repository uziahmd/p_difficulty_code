Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given m and then m lines of either '0' or '1'\n\n We note that Morse code representations for letters are of length 1 to 4, and there are 26 letters, but 30 possible binary strings (from length 1 to 4) and 4 are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\n We are building a string S one character at a time (each character is '0' or '1'). After each modification, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code.\n\n Important: The entire string S might be long (up to 3000 characters) and we cannot check every substring (which would be O(n^2)) because m can be up to 3000 and then the total number of substrings would be about 4.5e6 * 3000 which is too many.\n\n However, note: the representation of a letter is at most 4 bits. So we can use a sliding window and dynamic programming to count the valid representations.\n\n But note: the problem is asking for the number of distinct sequences of English letters. However, note that the same Morse code string (if it represents a valid letter) might appear multiple times, but the problem says \"non-empty sequences\" meaning we are counting sequences of letters. However, note: the example counts \"TT\", \"TM\", etc. as distinct sequences (even if the Morse code string \"11\" corresponds to one letter, then \"TT\" is two letters, each being 'T').\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters\". This means that we are counting the distinct ways to break a substring of S into consecutive valid Morse code representations? Or does it mean that we count every occurrence? \n\n Let me read the example: \n   After S=\"111\", the answer is 7.\n   They list: \n      \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\"\n\n But note: \n   - \"T\" is one letter (valid Morse code \"1\")\n   - \"M\" is one letter (valid Morse code \"11\")\n   - \"O\" is one letter (valid Morse code \"111\")\n   - \"TT\": two T's -> the substring must be broken as \"1\" and \"1\", so the entire substring \"11\" is used and broken into two \"1\"s. But wait, the substring \"11\" can also be interpreted as one letter \"M\". However, note the problem says: \"sequences of English letters\". So we are allowed to break the substring arbitrarily (as long as each part is a valid Morse code for a letter). But the example counts \"TT\" as a sequence (meaning two T's) and also counts \"M\" (the single letter M) and \"TT\" is different from \"M\".\n\n However, the example does not say that we are counting distinct Morse code strings. It says: \"non-empty sequences of English letters\". So we are counting the ways to break a substring into consecutive letters, and each breaking is a distinct sequence.\n\n But note: the same substring might be broken in multiple ways? For example, the string \"111\" can be broken as:\n   [1,1,1] -> T,T,T -> \"TTT\"\n   [11,1] -> M,T -> \"MT\"\n   [1,11] -> T,M -> \"TM\"\n   [111] -> O -> \"O\"\n\n However, the example lists \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\", and also \"T\", \"M\". \n\n Wait, the example also includes single letters: \"T\", \"M\", \"O\". And then the two-letter and three-letter sequences.\n\n How do we count?\n   We are to count every contiguous substring of S that can be partitioned into consecutive valid Morse code representations (each representation is one of the 26 letters) and then consider that as a sequence (and the same substring broken in different ways is considered different? Actually, the example counts \"TT\" (which is two T's) and \"M\" (which is one M) separately.\n\n But note: the problem does not require distinct sequences. It requires the number of non-empty sequences. However, the same sequence of letters (i.e., same string of letters) might be formed by multiple substrings? Actually, no: the sequence is defined by the order of letters and the breaks. But note: the same letter can appear multiple times and in different positions, but the problem says \"that are represented with some substring of S\". \n\n However, the example counts each distinct way to break a substring (each valid segmentation) as a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to efficiently count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a dynamically built string S. The string S is constructed by appending either '0' (dot) or '1' (dash) one character at a time. After each modification, we need to compute the answer modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that each valid Morse code sequence must be a substring of S and can be segmented into parts where each part is a valid Morse code for an English letter (length 1 to 4, excluding \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\"). The challenge is to count all possible valid segmentations of all substrings of S up to the current length.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array `dp[i]` which represents the number of ways to form valid sequences ending exactly at position `i` in S. The recurrence relation involves checking all possible valid Morse code lengths (1 to 4) ending at `i` and summing the valid segmentations.\n\n3. **Sliding Window and Validity Check**: For each new character added to S, we consider all possible substrings ending at the current position. For each substring, we check if it can be segmented into valid Morse codes. If valid, we update the DP array accordingly.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: By maintaining a sliding window and leveraging the fact that Morse codes are of bounded length (1 to 4), we ensure that each step processes only a constant number of previous positions, leading to an O(m) solution where m is the number of modifications.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    m = int(data[0])\n    s_list = []\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        s_list.append(data[i].strip())\n    \n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    total_ans = 0\n    ans_lines = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        char = s_list[i - 1]\n        new_dp = dp[i - 1][:]  # Copy previous state\n        \n        for j in range(i - 1, i - 5, -1):\n            if j < 0:\n                continue\n            substr = ''.join(s_list[k] for k in range(j, i))\n            valid = True\n            invalid_strings = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n            for pos in range(len(substr)):\n                if substr[pos] not in ['0', '1']:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                continue\n                \n            if len(substr) == 1:\n                if substr in invalid_strings:\n                    valid = False\n            elif len(substr) == 2:\n                if substr in invalid_strings:\n                    valid = False\n            elif len(substr) == 3:\n                if substr in invalid_strings:\n                    valid = False\n            elif len(substr) == 4:\n                if substr in invalid_strings:\n                    valid = False\n                    \n            if valid:\n                if j == 0:\n                    new_dp[i] = (new_dp[i] + 1) % MOD\n                else:\n                    new_dp[i] = (new_dp[i] + dp[j-1]) % MOD\n        \n        total_ans = (total_ans + new_dp[i]) % MOD\n        dp[i] = new_dp[i]\n        ans_lines.append(str(total_ans))\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(ans_lines))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values and initializes the DP array `dp` to store the number of valid sequences ending at each position.\n2. **Processing Each Character**: For each new character added to S, the code checks all possible substrings ending at the current position. Each substring is validated to ensure it represents a valid Morse code sequence (not one of the four invalid strings).\n3. **Dynamic Programming Update**: If a substring is valid, the DP value at the current position is updated by adding the number of valid sequences ending at the start of the substring. This ensures all valid segmentations are accounted for.\n4. **Output**: After processing each character, the total number of valid sequences up to that point is printed. The result is computed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks valid sequences by leveraging dynamic programming and sliding window techniques, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
