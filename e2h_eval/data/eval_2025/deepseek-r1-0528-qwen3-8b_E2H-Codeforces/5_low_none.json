Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (each string has n characters) and we need to form the maximum number of pairs (each pair: one left and one right) such that the colors are compatible.\n\n Conditions for compatibility:\n   - If both are specific letters: they must be the same.\n   - If one is '?' and the other is a letter: compatible.\n   - If both are '?': compatible.\n\n However, note that we have two separate arrays (left and right) and we cannot use a boot more than once.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can think of this as a bipartite matching problem, but note that n can be up to 150000. We cannot use general bipartite matching algorithms (like Hopcroft–Karp or network flow) because the graph might be too big.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider grouping by colors. But note: the colors are only lowercase letters and '?'. \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We want to maximize the number of pairs. Notice that:\n\n    - A '?' in either string can match any color. So we can use the '?' to fill in for any missing matches.\n\n 2. We can break down the problem:\n\n    Let's consider two types of boots: fixed (non '?') and wildcards (those with '?'). But note: even a fixed color might be matched with a '?' on the other side.\n\n 3. We can first try to match the fixed boots. Then, use the wildcards to match the remaining ones.\n\n However, note: sometimes we can use a wildcard to match two fixed boots? Actually, no: the problem says an indefinite color is compatible with any. So:\n\n    We can form a pair if:\n        (a) The left boot is fixed and the right boot is the same fixed letter, OR\n            the left boot is fixed and the right boot is '?', OR\n            the left boot is '?' and the right boot is fixed (any fixed), OR\n            both are '?'.\n\n 4. We can try to count the maximum pairs by:\n\n    Step 1: Count the frequency of each fixed color in the left and right.\n\n    But note: the wildcards are also present and they can match anything.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n    Let's define:\n\n        left_fixed: dictionary for non '?' in l\n        left_wild: count of '?' in l\n\n        right_fixed: dictionary for non '?' in r\n        right_wild: count of '?' in r\n\n    However, the catch is that we can use the fixed boots to match with fixed boots, and then the wildcards can match the leftovers. But note: a '?' in left can also match a fixed boot in the right, and vice versa.\n\n 6. Actually, we can form pairs in three ways:\n\n        a) Both fixed and same letter.\n        b) One fixed and one wildcard.\n        c) Both wildcards.\n\n    But note: we are allowed to assign arbitrarily (we don't care which exact pairs as long as we maximize). And the problem requires outputting the pairs (by index).\n\n 7. However, the problem is that the indices matter. We have to output the actual indices of the boots used.\n\n 8. Another idea: we can try to greedily match the fixed boots first, then use wildcards.\n\n    But note: the same fixed color might appear multiple times. We can match two fixed boots of the same color only if they are the same.\n\n    However, there is a caveat: if we have:\n\n        Left: \"a?b\"\n        Right: \"?a\"\n\n        We can match the first left 'a' with the first right '?', or the second left '?' with the second right 'a'. But note: the problem does not require the pairs to be formed by the same index, so we are free to assign arbitrarily.\n\n    But wait: the example output uses indices (the j-th left boot is at index j (1-indexed? actually the problem says \"the index of the left boot\", so the first boot is index 1). In the input, the first character is index 1.\n\n 9. We must output the pairs with the actual indices (from the input order). So we cannot simply group by color without tracking the index.\n\n 10. We can do:\n\n     We'll create two lists for left and right, each element being (color, index). Then we want to form as many pairs as possible.\n\n     Since n is large, we cannot iterate over all possibilities.\n\n 11. We can use a greedy matching on fixed colors, and then use wildcards for the rest. But how?\n\n     Steps:\n\n        Step 1: For each color (excluding '?'), we can match the fixed boots of that color from left and right, but note: we can also use a wildcard to match a fixed boot of that color? Actually, no: because the fixed boot",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility is defined such that two specific colors must be the same, an indefinite color ('?') can match any color, and two '?' characters are also compatible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots based on their colors, considering both fixed colors and wildcards ('?'). The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs efficiently, especially given the constraints where the number of boots can be as large as 150,000.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves categorizing boots into fixed colors and wildcards. Fixed colors can only match other fixed colors of the same letter or wildcards. Wildcards can match any color. The strategy is to first match boots with fixed colors, then use wildcards to match the remaining boots.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Frequency Counting**: For each fixed color, count occurrences in both left and right boots.\n   - **Greedy Matching**: Match fixed colors by pairing left and right boots of the same color. Use the minimum of the counts of each color for left and right boots.\n   - **Wildcard Handling**: After matching fixed colors, use wildcards to match any remaining boots. This involves pairing all remaining left and right wildcards.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot once for fixed colors and once for wildcards, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_fixed = []\n    left_wild = []\n    right_fixed = []\n    right_wild = []\n    \n    for i, (lc, rc) in enumerate(zip(l_str, r_str)):\n        if lc != '?':\n            left_fixed.append((lc, i + 1))\n        else:\n            left_wild.append(i + 1)\n            \n        if rc != '?':\n            right_fixed.append((rc, i + 1))\n        else:\n            right_wild.append(i + 1)\n            \n    left_dict = defaultdict(int)\n    for color, idx in left_fixed:\n        left_dict[color] += 1\n        \n    right_dict = defaultdict(int)\n    for color, idx in right_fixed:\n        right_dict[color] += 1\n        \n    pairs = []\n    \n    for color in set(left_dict.keys()) | set(right_dict.keys()):\n        if color == '?':\n            continue\n        count_left = left_dict.get(color, 0)\n        count_right = right_dict.get(color, 0)\n        common = min(count_left, count_right)\n        pairs.extend([(color, left_fixed.pop(0), right_fixed.pop(0)) for _ in range(common)])\n        \n    while left_fixed:\n        color, idx = left_fixed.pop(0)\n        if color in right_dict and right_dict[color] > 0:\n            right_dict[color] -= 1\n            pairs.append((color, idx, right_fixed.pop(0)))\n            \n    while right_fixed:\n        color, idx = right_fixed.pop(0)\n        if color in left_dict and left_dict[color] > 0:\n            left_dict[color] -= 1\n            pairs.append((color, left_fixed.pop(0)[1], idx))\n            \n    total_pairs = len(pairs)\n    print(total_pairs)\n    \n    for color, left_idx, right_idx in pairs:\n        print(f\"{left_idx} {right_idx}\")\n        \n    left_wild_remaining = left_wild[:]\n    right_wild_remaining = right_wild[:]\n    \n    while left_wild_remaining and right_wild_remaining:\n        left_idx = left_wild_remaining.pop(0)\n        right_idx = right_wild_remaining.pop(0)\n        print(f\"{left_idx} {right_idx}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boots `n`, followed by two strings representing the left and right boots' colors.\n2. **Categorization**: Boots are categorized into fixed colors and wildcards ('?').
