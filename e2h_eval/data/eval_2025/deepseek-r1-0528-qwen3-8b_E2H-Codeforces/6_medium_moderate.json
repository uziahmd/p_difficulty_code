Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x (total duration of two vouchers must be x)\n Then n lines, each: li, ri, costi\n\n Conditions for two vouchers i and j:\n 1. They are disjoint: either ri < lj or rj < li.\n 2. The sum of durations (ri - li + 1) + (rj - lj + 1) = x.\n\n Let d_i = ri - li + 1 (duration of voucher i)\n\n Then we require d_i + d_j = x.\n\n We want the minimal total cost (cost_i + cost_j) for which the two vouchers do not intersect.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute the duration for each voucher.\n\n 2. We can group vouchers by their duration. But note: two vouchers with the same duration might have different intervals.\n\n However, note that we require the two vouchers to be disjoint. So even if two vouchers have durations adding to x, they must not overlap.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can iterate over the vouchers and for each voucher i, we look for a voucher j such that:\n   d_i + d_j = x and the two intervals [l_i, r_i] and [l_j, r_j] do not intersect.\n\n But n and the days can be up to 200,000, so we cannot try all pairs.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Let's consider grouping by duration. For each distinct duration d, we store all vouchers (intervals) with that duration.\n\n Then, for each voucher i (with duration d_i), we need to find a voucher j (with duration x - d_i) such that the intervals don't intersect.\n\n However, how to check non-intersection? \n Two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] do not intersect if b < c or d < a.\n\n Since we are dealing with two intervals, we can also note that the condition is equivalent to:\n   Either: r_i < l_j   OR   r_j < l_i.\n\n But note: we are considering two specific intervals.\n\n However, we cannot simply take any interval from the group of duration (x-d_i) because the non-intersection condition depends on the actual endpoints.\n\n Idea:\n\n For each duration d, we want to quickly query: given an interval [l_i, r_i] (for voucher i) and we are looking for an interval in the set of duration (x-d) that does not intersect with it.\n\n Specifically, we require:\n   Condition 1: r_i < l_j   (then the first ends before the second starts)\n   Condition 2: r_j < l_i   (then the second ends before the first starts)\n\n We can preprocess for each duration d (and for the complementary duration x-d) the following:\n\n   We want to quickly get the minimum cost among all intervals of duration d that start after r_i+1 (for condition 1) or end before l_i-1 (for condition 2).\n\n But note: condition 1: we require an interval j with duration d' = x-d such that r_i < l_j. Also note that the duration of j is fixed (d') so the interval j has length d', hence the starting day l_j must be <= (max_day - d' + 1). Similarly, the ending day is l_j + d' - 1.\n\n Alternatively, we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n   Part 1: For a given voucher i, we are going to look for a voucher j (with duration d_j = x - d_i) that satisfies either:\n        (a) r_i < l_j   (so we need an interval j that starts after r_i) OR\n        (b) r_j < l_i   (so we need an interval j that ends before l_i)\n\n   But note: condition (a) requires that the entire interval i is before j, and condition (b) requires that the entire interval j is before i.\n\n   However, the problem does not require the two vouchers to be taken in order. So we must consider both possibilities.\n\n   But note: the condition is symmetric? Actually, the condition is defined as \"at least one\" of the two. So we must check both.\n\n   How to store the intervals for each duration?\n\n   We can create two dictionaries (or arrays) for each duration d (if d is within [1, 200000]):\n\n     dict1: for condition (a): we need to know the minimal cost for an interval of duration d that starts at or above a certain value. But actually, we want the minimal cost among all intervals of duration d that start after r_i. \n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d:\n\n     - A sorted list of the starting days (or ending days) and then use segment trees or binary search to get the minimal cost for intervals that start after a given day.\n\n   However, note that we are iterating over n vouchers, and for each we would do two queries (one for condition (a) and one for condition (b)) and then take the minimum of the two.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Precomputation:\n\n     Let's create an array (or dictionary) for each duration d (from 1 to maybe max_duration=200000) that stores:\n\n        Option 1: For condition (a) and (b) separately.\n\n     But note: condition (a) uses the starting day of j (must be > r_i) and condition (b) uses the ending day of j (must be < l_i). Also, the duration d_j is fixed (x-d_i).\n\n     Alternatively, we can store for each duration d:\n\n        - A sorted list of the starting days (or the entire intervals) and then also store the minimal cost for intervals that start at a certain day or above.\n\n     However, we can also store:\n\n        For each duration d, we can have two structures:\n\n          Structure A (for condition (a)): \n             We want to quickly get the minimal cost of an interval of duration d that starts at least after a given day 'low'.\n\n          Structure B (for condition (b)):\n             We want to quickly get the minimal cost of an interval of duration d that ends at most before a given day 'high'. (Note: an interval of duration d has end = start + d - 1, so if we fix the start, we can compute the end. Alternatively, we can index by the end.)\n\n     Alternatively, we can store:\n\n        For condition (a): \n            For a fixed duration d, let's have a list of (start, cost) for each interval of duration d. Then sort by start. Then we can also precompute an array min_cost_from_start[d] or min_cost_after_start[d] but note: we want the minimal cost for any interval with start >= some value.\n\n        Similarly, for condition (b):\n            We can store the same list by start, but then the condition is: the end (start+d-1) must be < l_i. That is, start < l_i - d + 1.\n\n        But wait, condition (b) is: the entire interval j must end before l_i, i.e., start_j + d - 1 < l_i -> start_j < l_i - d + 1.\n\n        So condition (b) can be rephrased in terms of the start: we require start_j < (l_i - d + 1).\n\n        However, note: condition (a): we require start_j > r_i (because the interval j must start after the current voucher i ends).\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          For each duration d, we have a list of (start, cost) and we sort by start.\n\n          Then, for condition (a): we want the minimal cost among intervals with start > r_i.\n          For condition (b): we want the minimal cost among intervals with start < (l_i - d + 1) [but note: d here is the duration of j, which is x-d_i].\n\n        But wait: in condition (b), the duration d is the duration of j, which is x-d_i. So when we are looking for j, we know d_j = x-d_i.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          Let d1 = d_i, then d2 = x - d1.\n\n          Then, for voucher i (with duration d1) we look in the group for duration d2:\n\n            Condition (a): find an interval j (in d2) with start_j > r_i, and take the minimal cost.\n\n            Condition (b): find an interval j (in d2) with start_j < (l_i - d2 + 1) [because then the end of j is start_j + d2 - 1 < l_i], and take the minimal cost.\n\n        Then the candidate for this voucher i is the minimum of the two conditions (if they exist).\n\n        Then, we combine the candidate from every voucher i.\n\n   However, note: we must consider that the same voucher might appear twice? No, we choose two distinct vouchers.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     Step 1: Precompute the duration for each voucher and store them.\n\n     Step 2: Group the vouchers by duration. But note: the duration can be from 1 to 200000 (since li, ri up to 200000, so maximum duration is 200000).\n\n        Let groups = {}  # key: duration d, value: list of (start, end, cost) but actually we only need start and cost, and we know d from the key.\n\n        But wait, for condition (b) we need the start to be less than (l_i - d2 + 1). However, we are storing by duration, and d2 is known from the key.\n\n     Step 3: For each duration d that appears, we build two structures:\n\n        Structure for condition (a): \n            We want to quickly query: given a value 'low', what is the minimal cost of an interval (voucher) in the group with duration d that has start >= low?\n\n        Structure for condition (b):\n            We want to quickly query: given a value 'high' (which is actually the start threshold: we require start < high), what is the minimal cost of an interval in the group with duration d that has start < high?\n\n        But note: condition (b) is expressed in terms of the start, and we can use the same sorted list for the start.\n\n        However, we can build:\n\n            For each duration d, we have a list of starts (and we can also store the minimal cost overall, but we need to query by start).\n\n        We can do:\n\n            For condition (a): sort the list of starts and then also keep a suffix minimum array (minimal cost from the right) for the sorted starts.\n\n            For condition (b): sort the list of starts and then keep a prefix minimum array (minimal cost from the left) for the sorted starts.\n\n        Example for condition (a):\n\n            Let L = list of starts (for duration d) and we sort them: L_sorted.\n            Then, we create an array M where M[i] = min{ cost for the voucher with start = L_sorted[j] for j from i to end }.\n\n            Then, for a given r_i, we find the smallest start in L_sorted that is greater than r_i (using bisect_right or bisect_left). Then the minimal cost for condition (a) is the minimal cost from that index to the end.\n\n        Similarly, for condition (b):\n\n            We sort the starts (same L_sorted) and then create an array P where P[i] = min{ cost for the voucher with start = L_sorted[j] for j from 0 to i }.\n\n            Then, for a given l_i and d2 (the duration of j, which is x-d1), the threshold is high = l_i - d2 + 1 (but note: condition is start < high). Then we find the largest start that is < high, and then the minimal cost for condition (b) is the minimal cost from the beginning to that point.\n\n     Step 4: Iterate over each voucher i (with duration d1, start l_i, end r_i, cost cost_i) and:\n\n            d2 = x - d1\n\n            If d2 is not in the groups (or d2 is negative or zero, then skip) then no solution for this voucher.\n\n            Then, we do two queries:\n\n                Query (a): in group[d2] (which has duration d2), find the minimal cost for an interval with start > r_i.\n\n                Query (b): in group[d2], find the minimal cost for an interval with start < (l_i - d2 + 1).\n\n            Then candidate = min( candidate(a), candidate(b) ) [if both exist]\n\n            Then update the global answer with candidate.\n\n     Step 5: If we found no candidate, output -1.\n\n   However, note: the two vouchers must be distinct. Our method by grouping and querying does not consider the same voucher twice? \n\n        We are storing the entire list of vouchers for duration d2. But if the same voucher is used twice? We must avoid using the same voucher.\n\n        But note: the problem requires two distinct vouchers.\n\n        How can we ensure that? \n\n        In our grouping, we store all vouchers. Then when we query, we are getting the minimal cost from the entire group. However, if the same voucher i is in the group for d2 (which is x-d1) then we might pick voucher i again. \n\n        But wait, when d1 + d2 = x, and if d1 == d2, then the group for d2 contains all vouchers of duration d1, including voucher i. \n\n        So if we are at voucher i (duration d1) and we are querying the group for d2 = x-d1, and if d1 == d2, then we must not use voucher i.\n\n        However, note: the condition for non-intersection: the two vouchers must not intersect. Even if we remove voucher i from the group, we still must check the non-intersection condition. But note: the non-intersection condition is independent.\n\n        But wait, the problem does not say that the two vouchers must be distinct in the sense of not being the same, but the input says \"choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j)\".\n\n        Therefore, we must not consider the same voucher.\n\n        How to handle?\n\n        We can either:\n\n          Option 1: When building the groups, we do not remove anything. Then, when we query, we might get the same voucher. Then we must check that the voucher we pick is not the same as i. But note: we don't have an id for the voucher. \n\n          Option 2: We can store the vouchers with their own identity (like index) and then when querying, we remember which voucher we are excluding.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints are large, and we are storing by duration. We cannot store the entire list of vouchers (including the index) and then for each voucher i, we remove the ones that are the same as i? That would be too slow.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute for each duration d the minimal cost for the entire set, and then if the minimal cost comes from a voucher that is the same as i (when d1 == d2) then we need to look for the next best. But wait, we are storing the entire list and building a structure that gives the minimal cost above a certain start. We cannot easily exclude a particular voucher.\n\n        Another idea: Do not use the same voucher. We can store the list of vouchers (with start, end, cost, and maybe an index) and then when we query, we can check if the voucher we found is the same as i. But without storing the index, we cannot.\n\n        Alternatively, we can build the groups without the index, and then we don't care about the identity. But then if the same voucher is included, then the condition (non-intersection) might be broken by the fact that the same voucher doesn't satisfy the non-intersection condition? Actually, the same voucher would have the same interval, and then the condition is:\n\n            Condition (a): r_i < l_i? (if we use the same voucher) -> no, because the interval is [l_i, r_i] and we require the other voucher to have start > r_i, but the same voucher has start = l_i, which is not > r_i (unless the duration is 0, but duration>=1). Similarly, condition (b): the same voucher would have end = r_i, and we require the other voucher to end < l_i, but the same voucher ends at r_i which is >= l_i (actually, the entire interval is [l_i, r_i] so the start is l_i and the end is r_i). So condition (b) requires an interval j that ends < l_i, but the same voucher j=i ends at r_i which is >= l_i (since the interval starts at l_i). \n\n        Therefore, the same voucher cannot be selected by either condition (a) or (b). \n\n        Why? \n\n          Condition (a): requires the other voucher to start after r_i. But the same voucher starts at l_i, and we know that for the same voucher: l_i <= r_i (by definition) and if l_i > r_i, then the duration would be negative, which is not allowed. So condition (a) fails.\n\n          Condition (b): requires the other voucher to end before l_i. But the same voucher ends at r_i, and we know that for the same voucher: r_i >= l_i (because the interval is [l_i, r_i]). So condition (b) requires r_i < l_i, which is false.\n\n        Therefore, we don't have to worry about the same voucher being selected because the non-intersection condition naturally excludes the same voucher.\n\n        BUT WAIT: what if the two vouchers are different but have the same interval? \n\n        The input does not guarantee distinct intervals. So two different vouchers might have the same interval [l, r]. Then, if we have two identical intervals, then:\n\n          Condition (a): for the first voucher, we require the second voucher to start after the first's end. But the second voucher starts at l, and the first ends at r. Then we require l > r -> which is false (because l<=r). Similarly, condition (b): the second voucher must end before the first's start -> r < l -> false.\n\n        So two identical intervals (same [l, r]) will not satisfy the non-intersection condition.\n\n        Therefore, even if there are duplicate intervals, we are safe because the condition (a) or (b) will fail for the same interval.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"exactly two vouchers\", and they can be duplicates? The input allows duplicate intervals? The problem does not say they are distinct.\n\n        But note: the condition for non-intersection is defined by the intervals. So if two intervals are identical, they do intersect (overlap completely). Therefore, they are not disjoint.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        However, what if two different vouchers have the same start and same end? Then they are the same interval. Then we cannot use them together because they are not disjoint.\n\n        But note: the grouping by duration: two identical intervals have the same duration. Then, when we query for condition (a) or (b) we are including all intervals of that duration. But the condition (a) or (b) requires the other interval to be disjoint, so two identical intervals are not disjoint.\n\n        However, our query method for condition (a) or (b) does not check the non-intersection beyond the start/end conditions. Actually, we are using the start and the fixed duration to determine the end. But wait, we are only using the start and the duration to check the non-intersection? \n\n        Actually, the condition (a) is: the entire interval i is before j: [l_i, r_i] and [l_j, r_j] must satisfy r_i < l_j. This is equivalent to the intervals not overlapping.\n\n        Similarly, condition (b): r_j < l_i.\n\n        But note: condition (a) does not depend on the entire duration of j? Actually, we know the duration of j is d2, so the interval j is [l_j, l_j+d2-1]. Then condition (a) is: r_i < l_j, which is sufficient because then the entire i is before j.\n\n        Similarly, condition (b): we require the entire j to be before i: r_j = l_j + d2 - 1 < l_i.\n\n        But note: the condition (a) and (b) are complete: they ensure non-overlap.\n\n        However, we are using the start of j to check. But note: the start of j determines the entire interval j (if we know the duration). So the condition (a) is: the end of i (r_i) is less than the start of j (l_j). This ensures that i is entirely before j.\n\n        Similarly, condition (b) is: the end of j (l_j + d2 - 1) is less than the start of i (l_i). This ensures that j is entirely before i.\n\n        Therefore, we are correctly capturing the non-overlap.\n\n        But note: what if the two intervals are not aligned by the same duration? \n\n        Example: \n          i: [1, 3] (duration 3)\n          j: [5, 6] (duration 2)\n\n        Then condition (a): 3 < 5 -> true, so they are disjoint.\n\n        Condition (b): 6 < 1 -> false.\n\n        So condition (a) holds.\n\n        Now, if we have:\n\n          i: [1, 3] (duration 3)\n          j: [2, 4] (duration 3)\n\n        Then condition (a): 3 < 2 -> false.\n        Condition (b): 4 < 1 -> false.\n\n        So they are not disjoint.\n\n        Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Read n, x.\n          2. Read the n lines and compute the duration d = ri - li + 1 for each.\n\n          3. Build a dictionary (or list) for groups by duration. But note: the duration can be from 1 to 200000, so we can use an array of size maybe 200001 (index from 1 to 200000) and initialize with empty lists.\n\n          4. For each voucher (l, r, cost), compute d = r-l+1, then append (l, cost) to group[d]. Note: we don't need the entire interval, just the start and the cost.\n\n          5. For each duration d that exists, we build two structures:\n\n                Let arr = group[d]   # list of (start, cost)\n\n                We will build:\n\n                  - A sorted list of the starts (for condition (a) and (b) we use the same list).\n                  - Then, for condition (a) (query: start > X): \n                      Sort the list of starts, and then create an array min_cost_suffix such that min_cost_suffix[i] = min(cost for all elements from index i to the end) in the sorted list.\n\n                  - For condition (b) (query: start < Y):\n                      We can use the same sorted list and then create an array min_cost_prefix such that min_cost_prefix[i] = min(cost for all elements from index 0 to i).\n\n                But note: we want to query by the start, and the condition (a) is on the start (we need start > X) and condition (b) is on the start (we need start < Y).\n\n                However, the condition (b) is expressed in terms of the start, and we know that the start must be less than (l_i - d2 + 1). And d2 is the duration of j, which is x-d1.\n\n          6. We'll create a dictionary `groups_by_duration` that maps duration d to a tuple (sorted_list_of_starts, min_cost_suffix, min_cost_prefix) for condition (a) and (b) respectively.\n\n          7. Then, for each voucher i (with l_i, r_i, cost_i and duration d1):\n\n                d2 = x - d1\n\n                If d2 < 1 or d2 > 200000 (or if d2 is not in the groups_by_duration) then skip.\n\n                Then, for condition (a):\n\n                    We want to query the group for d2: get the minimal cost for an interval with start > r_i.\n\n                    Steps for condition (a):\n\n                      Let arr = groups_by_duration[d2][0]   (the sorted starts)\n                      Let suffix_min = groups_by_duration[d2][1]   (min_cost_suffix)\n\n                      Find the first index in arr that is > r_i. We can use bisect_right: \n\n                         pos = bisect.bisect_right(arr, r_i)   -> returns the insertion position, which is the index of the first element > r_i.\n\n                      If pos >= len(arr): then no interval for condition (a).\n\n                      Otherwise, candidate_a = suffix_min[pos]\n\n                Similarly, for condition (b):\n\n                    We want to query the group for d2: get the minimal cost for an interval with start < (l_i - d2 + 1)\n\n                    Let threshold = l_i - d2 + 1\n\n                    If threshold <= 0, then no interval (because start must be at least 1) so skip condition (b).\n\n                    Then, find the last index in arr that is < threshold. \n\n                      pos2 = bisect.bisect_left(arr, threshold) - 1   -> the index of the last element < threshold is pos2 = bisect_left(arr, threshold) - 1.\n\n                    Then, if pos2 < 0, no interval.\n\n                    Otherwise, candidate_b = min_cost_prefix[pos2]   (the prefix min at that index)\n\n                Then, candidate = min(candidate_a, candidate_b) if both exist, else the one that exists.\n\n                Then, update global_ans = min(global_ans, candidate)\n\n          8. If global_ans remains infinity, output -1, else output global_ans.\n\n   However, note: condition (b) uses the same group (d2) and the same list of starts. But the condition (b) is expressed by the start being below a threshold, and we built the prefix min array for the entire sorted list.\n\n   But wait: the condition (b) requires the entire interval j to end before l_i, which is equivalent to start_j + d2 - 1 < l_i. But we are storing the start_j. However, we are not checking the entire condition (b) by the start_j alone? \n\n        Actually, condition (b): the entire interval j must end before l_i. The end is start_j + d2 - 1. So we require start_j + d2 - 1 < l_i  => start_j < l_i - d2 + 1.\n\n        So we are using the correct threshold.\n\n   But note: the condition (b) is independent of the duration d1, but we are using d2 (which is x-d1). This is correct.\n\n   However, what if d2 is negative? Then skip. Also, if d2 is not in the groups, skip.\n\n   But note: d2 = x - d1, and d1 is at least 1, so d2 can be as low as x-200000 (if d1 is 200000) and x can be up to 200000, so d2 could be negative. We should check d2>=1.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   One more thing: the groups_by_duration for a particular duration d2 might be empty. Then we skip.\n\n   Time complexity:\n\n        We have up to 200000 vouchers, and we are grouping by duration (at most 200000 distinct durations). For each duration, we sort the list and build two arrays. The total number of vouchers is n, so the total work for sorting and building arrays is O(n log n).\n\n        Then, we iterate over each voucher (n times) and do two binary searches (each O(log n)). So overall O(n log n).\n\n   Edge: when there are no vouchers for a particular duration, then we skip.\n\n   Let's test with the example:\n\n        Input: \n           4 5\n           1 3 4\n           1 2 5\n           5 6 1\n           1 2 4\n\n        Vouchers:\n\n          voucher0: l=1, r=3, cost=4 -> duration=3\n          voucher1: l=1, r=2, cost=5 -> duration=2\n          voucher2: l=5, r=6, cost=1 -> duration=2\n          voucher3: l=1, r=2, cost=4 -> duration=2\n\n        x=5, so d2 for each:\n\n          voucher0 (d1=3): d2=2 -> exists (there are three vouchers of duration2)\n          voucher1 (d1=2): d2=3 -> exists (voucher0)\n          voucher2 (d1=2): d2=3 -> exists (voucher0)\n          voucher3 (d1=2): d2=3 -> exists (voucher0)\n\n        Now, for voucher0 (duration3, start1, end3, cost4):\n\n          condition (a): d2=2, we need an interval in duration2 with start > 3.\n          The duration2 group: starts [1,1,5] (from vouchers1,3,2). Sorted: [1,1,5]\n          suffix_min for [1,1,5]: \n            sorted: [1,1,5]\n            suffix_min[0] = min(4,5,1) -> wait, no: we are storing (start, cost) for each voucher. Actually, we stored for duration2: \n                voucher1: (1,5)\n                voucher2: (5,1)\n                voucher3: (1,4)\n\n            So the list for duration2: [(1,5), (5,1), (1,4)] -> then we extract the starts: [1,1,5] and the costs: [5,1,4] -> then we build:\n\n                sorted starts: [1,1,5]\n                Then, we also need to associate the costs. So we should store the list of (start, cost) and then sort by start, and then for the same start, we can take the minimal cost? Actually, we want the minimal cost for the entire set of intervals with start greater than 3.\n\n            Alternatively, we can store the entire list (start, cost) and then when building the suffix_min, we consider the minimal cost from that index to the end.\n\n            Steps for building for duration2:\n\n                Start list: [1,1,5]\n                We also need to have the corresponding costs: [5,4,1] (if we sort by start, then the first two starts are 1, and we want the minimal cost for start>=some value).\n\n                Actually, we can build:\n\n                    sorted_start = sorted(starts)  -> [1,1,5]\n                    Then, we need to know the minimal cost from each start onward.\n\n                    But note: if two intervals have the same start, we want the minimal cost for that start and beyond.\n\n                    So we can do:\n\n                      data = sorted( [(start, cost) for (start, cost) in ...], key=lambda x: x[0])\n                      Then, we extract the starts and the costs, and then build a suffix_min array for the costs.\n\n                However, we have multiple starts. We can do:\n\n                    data = []\n                    for each voucher in group[d]:\n                        data.append( (start, cost) )\n                    sort data by start.\n\n                    Then, create a list of starts and a list of costs (in the same order).\n\n                    Then, build suffix_min for the costs: from last element to first.\n\n                    Example: data = [(1,5), (1,4), (5,1)] -> sorted by start: [(1,5), (1,4), (5,1)]\n\n                    Then, starts = [1,1,5]\n                    costs = [5,4,1]\n                    suffix_min = [min(5,4,1)=1, min(4,1)=1, 1]\n\n                But wait, we want the minimal cost for starts >= some value. So if we are at index0 (start=1) then the minimal cost for starts>=1 is 1 (from the last element). However, we are going to query by the condition (a): start>3 -> then we look for the first index where start>3. That is index2 (start=5). Then the minimal cost from index2 is 1.\n\n                Condition (a) for voucher0: minimal cost for duration2 with start>3 is 1.\n\n                Condition (b) for voucher0: we require start < (l0 - d2 + 1) = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0 -> no interval.\n\n                So candidate for voucher0 = 1.\n\n          Then, for voucher1 (duration2, start1, end2, cost5):\n\n                d2=3, group[3] has only voucher0: [(1,4)]\n\n                Condition (a): start>2 (voucher1's end is 2) -> we need an interval in group3 with start>2. \n                    group3: sorted_start=[1] -> no element >2 -> condition (a) fails.\n\n                Condition (b): start < (1-3+1) = -1 -> fails.\n\n                candidate = not available.\n\n          Similarly, voucher2 (duration2, start5, end6, cost1):\n\n                Condition (a): d2=3, group3: we need start>6 -> none.\n\n                Condition (b): start < (5-3+1)=3 -> we need an interval in group3 with start<3. \n                    group3: starts=[1] -> minimal cost=4.\n\n                candidate = 4.\n\n          voucher3 (duration2, start1, end2, cost4):\n\n                Condition (a): start>2 -> group3: no element (only start1) -> fail.\n                Condition (b): start < (1-3+1)=-1 -> fail.\n\n          Then the minimal candidate is min(1, 4) = 1.\n\n          But the sample output is 5.\n\n          Wait, what? \n\n          Let me re-check the sample: \n\n            The sample says: Leha should choose first and third vouchers. \n\n            First voucher: [1,3] with cost4, third voucher: [5,6] with cost1 -> total cost 5.\n\n          Why did we get 1?\n\n          Because we considered the pair (voucher0, voucher2) and got 1 (from voucher2's cost) but wait: the total cost for the two vouchers is 4 (voucher0) + 1 (voucher2) = 5.\n\n          But in our method, we are storing the entire list for duration2 (voucher0: duration3) and then for voucher0 we queried for duration2 and found the minimal cost (voucher2) is 1. Then we update global_ans to 1? \n\n          This is incorrect because the total cost is the cost of voucher0 (which is 4) plus the cost of the found voucher (which is 1) -> 5.\n\n          But wait, in our code, when we are processing voucher0, we are not adding the cost of voucher0. We are only using the cost of the found voucher. \n\n          Correction:\n\n          In the problem, we choose two vouchers. The cost is the sum of the two.\n\n          But in our method, we are storing the entire list of vouchers (by duration) and then for a given voucher i (with cost_i) we are finding a voucher j (with cost_j) and then the total cost is cost_i + cost_j.\n\n          However, in our query we are returning the minimal cost_j for the condition. Then we should add cost_i? \n\n          But wait, no: because we are storing the entire list of vouchers (without the current one) and then we are looking for the minimal cost_j. Then the candidate for the pair (i, j) is cost_i + cost_j.\n\n          But in our code, we are not including cost_i in the candidate. \n\n          We are doing:\n\n            candidate = minimal cost_j (from the query) \n\n          Then we are updating global_ans with candidate. \n\n          But that candidate is only the cost of the second voucher. We must include the cost of the first voucher.\n\n          How to fix?\n\n          We can do:\n\n            candidate_total = cost_i + candidate_j\n\n          Then update global_ans = min(global_ans, candidate_total)\n\n          But then, we must store the cost_i as well.\n\n          However, note: the query returns candidate_j (the minimal cost for the second voucher). Then we add cost_i.\n\n          But wait, in our example for voucher0 (cost_i=4) and we found candidate_j=1, then candidate_total=5.\n\n          Then, for voucher2 (cost_i=1) and we found candidate_j=4 (from condition (b)), then candidate_total=5.\n\n          Then, the minimal candidate_total is 5.\n\n          But in our code, we were not storing cost_i. We are iterating over each voucher i, and we have its cost_i.\n\n          So we must modify:\n\n            For voucher i, we have (l_i, r_i, cost_i, d1)\n\n            Then, for condition (a): candidate_j = query_a(d2, r_i)   (minimal cost for j in group[d2] with start>r_i)\n\n            Then candidate_total = cost_i + candidate_j\n\n            Similarly for condition (b): candidate_total = cost_i + candidate_j\n\n          Then update global_ans = min(global_ans, candidate_total) for each candidate.\n\n          But note: we must consider both conditions independently. So we do:\n\n            candidate1 = a big number\n            candidate2 =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently grouping the vouchers by their duration and then querying these groups to find valid pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires selecting two non-overlapping vouchers whose durations sum to `x`. The key challenge is efficiently checking all possible pairs without resorting to a brute-force approach, which would be computationally expensive for large inputs.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By grouping vouchers by their duration, we can quickly access all vouchers that could potentially form a valid pair with a given voucher. For each voucher, we look for another voucher in the complementary duration group (i.e., `x - current_duration`) that does not overlap with it.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration into a dictionary where each key is a duration, and the value is a list of tuples containing the start day and cost of each voucher in that duration group.\n   - **Binary Search for Efficiency**: For each duration group, we sort the start days and precompute prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays. This allows us to quickly find the minimal cost voucher in a specified range (either starting after a certain day or before a certain day) using binary search.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: The solution involves sorting and processing each voucher's duration group, which takes O(n log n) time due to sorting. Each query operation (for finding the minimal cost voucher in a range) is O(log n) per voucher, leading to an overall O(n log n) time complexity.\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space required is O(n) to store the grouped vouchers and their associated structures (prefix and suffix minima).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        cost_i = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost_i))\n        \n    max_day = 200000\n    groups_by_duration = {}\n    for d in range(1, max_day+1):\n        groups_by_duration[d] = ([], [], [])\n    \n    for (l, r, cost_i) in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        if d < 1 or d > max_day:\n            continue\n        starts_list, costs_list = groups_by_duration[d][0], groups_by_duration[d][2]\n        bisect.insort(starts_list, l)\n        bisect.insort(costs_list, cost_i)\n        \n    for d in range(1, max_day+1):\n        starts = groups_by_duration[d][0]\n        costs = groups_by_duration[d][2]\n        if not starts:\n            continue\n            \n        sorted_starts = starts\n        sorted_costs = costs\n        \n        prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_starts)\n        prefix_min[0] = sorted_costs[0]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_starts)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_costs[i])\n            \n        suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_starts)\n        suffix_min[-1] = sorted_costs[-1]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_starts)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_costs[i])\n            \n        groups_by_duration[d] = (sorted_starts, suffix_min, prefix_min)\n        \n    INF = 10**18\n    global_ans = INF\n    \n    for (l, r, cost_i) in vouchers:\n        d1 = r - l + 1\n        d2 = x - d1\n        if d2 < 1 or d2 > max_day or d2 not in groups_by_duration:\n            continue\n            \n        s_arr, suffix_min_arr, prefix_min_arr = groups_by_duration[d2]\n        candidate_a = INF\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(s_arr, r)\n        if pos < len(s_arr):\n            candidate_a = suffix_min_arr[pos]\n            \n        candidate_b = INF\n        threshold = l - d2 + 1\n        if threshold <= 0:\n            pass\n        else:\n            pos2 = bisect.bisect_left(s_arr, threshold)\n            if pos2 > 0:\n                candidate_b = prefix_min_arr[pos2-1]\n                \n        total_candidate = INF\n        if candidate_a != INF:\n            total_candidate = min(total_candidate, cost_i + candidate_a)\n        if candidate_b != INF:\n            total_candidate = min(total_candidate, cost_i + candidate_b)\n            \n        if total_candidate < global_ans:\n            global_ans = total_candidate\n            \n    if global_ans == INF:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(global_ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each characterized by its start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration (computed as `end - start + 1`). Each group stores the start days and costs of its vouchers.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration group, the start days are sorted, and prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays are computed. These arrays allow efficient range queries to find the minimal cost voucher starting after a certain day or before a certain day.\n4. **Query Processing**: For each voucher, the algorithm checks if there exists a voucher in the complementary duration group (i.e., `x - current_duration`) that does not overlap with it. The minimal cost valid voucher is found using binary search on the preprocessed data.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimal total cost of valid pairs is tracked and printed. If no valid pair is found, `-1` is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
