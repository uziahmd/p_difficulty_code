He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n, k and a list of n integers.\n Conditions: \n   - We have to split the list of n problems (in order) into exactly k contiguous non-empty segments.\n   - Each day's profit is the maximum difficulty in that segment.\n   - We want to maximize the total profit.\n\n Observation:\n   The total profit is the sum of the maximums of each contiguous segment.\n\n We can use dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] be the maximum total profit for the first i problems (i.e., the prefix of length i) over j days.\n However, note that we have to assign exactly k segments and we must cover all n problems.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n   Let dp[j][i] = maximum total profit from the first i problems using j days.\n\n How to compute?\n   We know that the last day (the j-th day) will cover a contiguous segment from some index x to i (inclusive). Then the profit for the last day is the maximum in the segment [x, i].\n\n   But note: the entire segment [x, i] has maximum value M. Then the state transition would be:\n        dp[j][i] = max_{x from 0 to i-1} { dp[j-1][x] + M } \n   However, M is the maximum from x to i. We can precompute the maximums for all segments? But n and k up to 2000, so we need an efficient way.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate the end of the last segment and use a pointer to extend and update the maximum.\n\n   Steps for dp:\n     dp[0][0] = 0, but we need at least one problem per day. We'll consider segments of at least one problem.\n\n   Actually, let dp[i][j] = maximum total profit for the first i problems (i.e., problems 0 to i-1) using j days.\n\n   Then we have:\n        dp[i][j] = max_{x from j-1 to i-1} { dp[x][j-1] + max_segment(x, i) }\n\n   But note: the segment from x to i-1 (if our array is 0-indexed) has maximum which we can precompute with a 2D array or using a sparse table? \n   However, n is only 2000, so we can do an O(n^2) solution.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a different approach: we know that the maximum in a segment is non-decreasing as we extend the segment. So we can try to fix the starting point and then move the ending point.\n\n   But note: we are required to output the distribution as well.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use greedy and note that the optimal segmentation is determined by the condition that the maximum in a segment should be as large as possible, and we want to \"capture\" the large numbers as much as possible.\n\n   Another idea: the total profit is the sum of the maximums of contiguous segments. Note that the same large number might appear again and we cannot break a segment arbitrarily without affecting the maximum.\n\n   We can also think about the fact that the maximum for a segment must be one of the elements in the array. Moreover, if we look at the array, we can consider breaking the array such that the maximum of a segment is at least the next higher element.\n\n   However, we can use the following:\n\n   Let dp[i][j] = maximum total profit for the first i problems (using j days) and we know that the j-th day ends at i-1.\n\n   Then, we can let:\n        dp[i][j] = max_{p from j-1 to i-1} { dp[p][j-1] + max(a[p:i]) }\n\n   But we need to compute max(a[p:i]) quickly. We can precompute a 2D array for the maximums? That would be O(n^2) memory and time, which is acceptable for n=2000? Actually, 2000*2000 = 4e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we have to be cautious.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a technique where we iterate the end of the segment and then move the start and keep track of the maximum.\n\n   However, note that the problem requires also to output the distribution. So we need to store not only the maximum profit but also the segmentation.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Precomputation: \n        Let's define a 2D array seg_max, where seg_max[i][j] = maximum of a[i:j+1] (for i<=j). But we can compute this by:\n            seg_max[i][i] = a[i]\n            for j from i+1 to n-1: seg_max[i][j] = max(seg_max[i][j-1], a[j])\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp gets from solving all problems over exactly `k` days. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The key insight is to use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the optimal segmentation of the problem list into `k` contiguous segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the first `i` problems and `j` represents the number of days used. The value `dp[i][j]` stores the maximum total profit achievable by segmenting the first `i` problems into `j` days.\n\n2. **Segment Maximum Precomputation**: To efficiently compute the maximum difficulty in any segment, we precompute a 2D array `max_val` where `max_val[l][r]` holds the maximum value in the segment from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). This allows us to quickly access the maximum difficulty for any segment during the DP transitions.\n\n3. **DP Transition**: For each state `dp[i][j]`, we consider all possible starting points `x` for the last segment (from `x` to `i-1`). The transition involves taking the best value from `dp[x][j-1]` and adding the maximum difficulty of the segment from `x` to `i-1`.\n\n4. **Backtracking for Solution**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact segmentation that achieves the maximum profit. This involves identifying the segments used in each day by checking which segments contributed to the maximum value in the DP table.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    \n    max_val = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_val[i][i] = a[i]\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            max_val[i][j] = max(max_val[i][j-1], a[j])\n            \n    dp = [[-1]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            if i < j:\n                continue\n            best = -1\n            for x in range(j-1, i):\n                seg_max_val = max_val[x][i-1]\n                prev_profit = dp[x][j-1]\n                total_profit = prev_profit + seg_max_val\n                if total_profit > best:\n                    best = total_profit\n            dp[i][j] = best\n            \n    total_profit = dp[n][k]\n    print(total_profit)\n    \n    x = n\n    y = k\n    segments = []\n    while x > 0 and y > 0:\n        found = False\n        for i in range(y-1, x):\n            seg_max_val = max_val[i][x-1]\n            if dp[x][y] == dp[i][y-1] + seg_max_val:\n                segments.append(x - i)\n                x = i\n                y -= 1\n                found = True\n                break\n        if not found:\n            segments.append(1)\n            x -= 1\n    segments.reverse()\n    \n    print(\" \".join(map(str, segments)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of problems `n`, the number of days `k`, and the list of problem difficulties.\n2. **Precomputing Segment Maximums**: The `max_val` table is built such that `max_val[l][r]` contains the maximum difficulty in the segment from `l` to `r`.\n3. **DP Table Initialization**: The DP table `dp[i][j]` is initialized with `-1` to denote unreachable states, except for `dp[0][0]` which is set to `0`.\n4. **Filling DP Table**: For each `i` (number of problems considered) and `j` (days used), the algorithm checks all possible segments ending at `i-1` and updates `dp[i][j]` with the maximum profit achievable.\n5. **Backtracking**: Starting from `dp[n][k]`, the algorithm backtracks to determine the exact segments used each day, ensuring the solution meets the problem's requirements. The segments are then reversed to present them in the correct order.\n6. **Output**: The maximum total profit and the corresponding segment lengths are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal segmentation using dynamic programming and ensures correctness by leveraging precomputed segment maximums and careful backtracking.",
