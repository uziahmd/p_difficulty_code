    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge.\n\n Observation:\n For the i-th ring (0-indexed in our mind, but the problem says first one is i=1), the inner rectangle size is (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n However, note that the ring has a width of 1 cell. The ring is the border of the inner rectangle.\n\n But note: the example input \"3 3 1\" gives 8. \n   w=3, h=3, k=1: \n      The entire plate is 3x3. The first ring is the outer border. The inner rectangle for the first ring is (3 - 4*0) = 3x3. Then the border of 3x3 is 3*4 - 4 = 8? Actually, wait:\n\n How many cells in the border of a rectangle of size n x m?\n   If n>=2 and m>=2, then the border is: 2*n + 2*m - 4 (because each side has n or m, but subtract the 4 corners which are counted twice).\n\n However, note: if we have a rectangle of size n x m (with n and m at least 1), then the border (the outermost ring) has:\n   top row: n cells\n   bottom row: n cells\n   left column: m-2 cells (excluding the two already counted in top and bottom)\n   right column: m-2 cells\n   Total: 2*n + 2*(m-2) = 2*n + 2*m - 4.\n\n But note: the problem states that the first ring goes along the edge of the plate (which is w x h). So for the first ring (i=1):\n   inner rectangle is w x h -> so the ring is the border of the original plate: 2*w + 2*h - 4.\n\n However, let's check with the example: w=3, h=3 -> 2*3 + 2*3 - 4 = 6+6-4 = 8. Correct.\n\n Now the second ring (if k>=2) would be built on the inner rectangle that is (w-4) x (h-4). But wait: the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. \n   So the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w - 4) x (h - 4). Then the ring itself is the border of that inner rectangle: 2*(w-4) + 2*(h-4) - 4.\n\n However, note the example input \"7 9 2\": \n   First ring: 2*7 + 2*9 - 4 = 14+18-4 = 28.\n   Second ring: 2*(7-4) + 2*(9-4) - 4 = 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+10-4 = 12.\n   Total = 28 + 12 = 40. But the example output for \"7 9 2\" is 40.\n\n However, wait: the example input \"7 9 2\" is provided as an example and the expected output is 40. But the example input list was: ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2'] and outputs ['8','28','40'].\n\n But note: the problem says the first ring is the edge, the second is 2 cells away. The inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4) because we moved 2 cells inward on each side (so 2*2=4 reduction per dimension).\n\n Therefore, the total gilded cells = sum_{i=1}^{k} [ 2*(w - 4*(i-1)) + 2*(h - 4*(i-1)) - 4 ]\n\n However, let me re-express: \n   Let d = i-1 (the step index). Then for the i-th ring (starting at i=1) we have:\n        ring_i = 2*(w - 4*d) + 2*(h - 4*d) - 4\n               = 2*w + 2*h - 8*d - 4\n\n But wait: we can factor this as:\n        = 2*(w+h-1) - 8*d - 4   [but wait, 2*w+2*h-4 - 8*d]?\n\n Actually, 2*w+2*h-4 is the first term (d=0). Then subtract 8 for each step.\n\n Alternatively, we can write the total as:\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            d = i   # because we start from the first ring (d=0) to the k-th ring (d=k-1)\n            side1 = w - 4*i\n            side2 = h - 4*i\n            if side1 < 3 or side2 < 3: \n                # Actually, according to the problem, k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) so we don't go below 3?\n                # But note: the condition ensures that we have at least a 3x3 for the first ring, and for the next rings we subtract multiples of 4. \n                # However, the problem says k is at most floor((min(n,m)+1)/4). So for the last ring, the inner rectangle will be at least 3x? (but actually both dimensions must be at least 3? Because the border requires at least 3x3 to form a ring? Actually, the ring is defined by the border of the inner rectangle. The inner rectangle must have at least 2x2 to have a border? But wait, the formula 2*n+2*m-4 for a border: if n=1 or m=1, then it breaks. However, the problem says k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n But note: the condition on k: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). This ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is (w-4*(k-1)) x (h-4*(k-1)) and both dimensions are at least 3? \n\n Let's check: \n   min(w,h) >= 3, and k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). Then the smallest dimension of the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is:\n        min_side = min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= 3 - 4*(k-1)\n\n But wait, we need the inner rectangle to be at least 3x3? Actually, the problem says the first ring is the edge (so the entire plate must be at least 3x3). For the second ring, the inner rectangle must be at least 3x3? Actually, the second ring requires the inner rectangle to be (w-4) x (h-4) and we require that (w-4) >= 1 and (h-4) >= 1? But the formula for the border of a rectangle requires at least 2x2? However, the problem states that k is bounded such that the rings do not go beyond the plate.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — 2 cells away from the edge and so on\". And the example: 7x9 plate, k=2: the second ring uses an inner rectangle of 3x5, which is valid.\n\n But note: the border of a 3x5 rectangle: 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+10-4 = 12. That is correct.\n\n However, the formula for the i-th ring (0-indexed i from 0 to k-1) is:\n        s1 = w - 4*i\n        s2 = h - 4*i\n        If s1 < 2 or s2 < 2, then we cannot form a border? But the problem condition on k ensures that the last ring has s1 and s2 at least 3 (if we consider the minimal requirement for having a ring? Actually, the ring is defined as the border of the inner rectangle. The border of a rectangle of size a x b (a,b>=1) is defined only if a>=1 and b>=1, but the formula 2*a+2*b-4 becomes negative if a=1 or b=1? \n\n However, the problem's k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). Let m = min(w,h). Then the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is (m - 4*(k-1)) x ... and we require m - 4*(k-1) >= 3? Actually, the condition is: \n        k <= floor((m+1)/4)  => 4*k - 4 <= m - 1  => 4*k <= m+3  => m - 4*(k-1) >= m - 4*(floor((m+1)/4)-1) ?\n\n Since k is bounded, we don't have to worry about negative values or invalid rectangles.\n\n Steps:\n\n We can compute the total number of cells by iterating from i=0 to i=k-1 (for the k rings) and summing:\n        ring_i = 2*(w - 4*i) + 2*(h - 4*i) - 4\n\n But note: the above formula for the border is valid only when the rectangle has at least 2 rows and 2 columns? Actually, if the rectangle is 1x? then the border is just the entire thing? But the problem condition ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 3x3 (or at least 3 in one dimension and ...) but wait: the minimal condition is that the inner rectangle must be at least 3 in the smaller dimension? \n\n Actually, the problem condition is: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n Example: w=3, h=3, k=1 -> floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1 -> valid.\n\n Another: w=7, h=9, k=2 -> min(7,9)=7, floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2 -> valid.\n\n But for the second ring: \n        w' = 7-4=3, h'=9-4=5 -> valid.\n\n However, if we had k=3 for w=7, h=9: \n        floor((7+1)/4)=2, so k=3 is not allowed. Hence, we don't have to worry.\n\n Therefore, we can simply iterate and compute.\n\n Alternatively, we can derive a closed form:\n\n        total = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [ 2*(w - 4*i) + 2*(h - 4*i) - 4 ]\n             = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [ 2*w + 2*h - 4 - 8*i ]\n             = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8 * (0+1+...+(k-1))\n             = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8 * (k*(k-1)//2)\n             = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 4*k*(k-1)\n\n Let me test with the examples:\n\n Example 1: w=3, h=3, k=1\n        = 1*(2*3+2*3-4) - 4*1*0\n        = 1*(6+6-4) = 8. Correct.\n\n Example 2: w=7, h=9, k=1\n        = 1*(2*7+2*9-4) - 0\n        = 14+18-4 = 28. Correct.\n\n Example 3: w=7, h=9, k=2\n        = 2*(2*7+2*9-4) - 4*2*1\n        = 2*(14+18-4) - 8\n        = 2*28 - 8 = 56-8 = 48 -> wait, but expected is 40.\n\n Wait, what? \n\n Let me recalculate the closed form:\n\n        Each term for i=0: 2*(7+9) - 4 - 8*0 = 2*16-4 = 32-4=28.\n        Each term for i=1: 2*(7-4+9-4) - 4 - 8*1 = 2*(3+5)-4-8 = 2*8-12 = 16-12=4? \n        Actually, no: the formula for the second ring (i=1) is 2*(w-4*1) + 2*(h-4*1) - 4 = 2*3 + 2*5 - 4 = 6+10-4=12.\n\n        So the closed form I derived was: \n            term_i = 2*w + 2*h - 4 - 8*i   [But wait, is that correct?]\n\n        Let me break down the term for i=0: 2*w+2*h-4-8*0 = 2*7+2*9-4 = 14+18-4=28 -> correct.\n        For i=1: 2*7+2*9-4-8*1 = 28 -8 = 20 -> but that is not 12.\n\n Why? The formula I used in the closed form was:\n\n        ring_i = 2*(w - 4*i) + 2*(h - 4*i) - 4\n               = 2*w - 8*i + 2*h - 8*i - 4\n               = 2*w + 2*h - 4 - 16*i\n\n Ah! There's a mistake: I said 8*i, but it's 8*i for the width and 8*i for the height? Actually, 2*(w -4*i) is 2*w -8*i, and similarly 2*(h-4*i) is 2*h -8*i. Then the whole term is 2*w+2*h-8*i-8*i-4 = 2*w+2*h-16*i-4.\n\n So the closed form should be:\n\n        total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 16 * (0+1+...+(k-1)) \n        = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 16 * (k*(k-1)//2)\n        = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n Now test with w=7, h=9, k=2:\n\n        = 2*(14+18-4) - 8*2*1\n        = 2*28 - 16 = 56 - 16 = 40. Correct.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n But wait, why did I get confused? The term for i-th ring (0-indexed) is:\n\n        term_i = 2*(w - 4*i) + 2*(h - 4*i) - 4\n               = 2*w + 2*h - 4 - 8*i - 8*i   ??? No, wait: 2*(w-4*i) = 2*w - 8*i, and 2*(h-4*i)=2*h-8*i. Then we subtract 4. So total for the i-th term: 2*w+2*h-8*i-8*i-4? Actually, no:\n\n        It's 2*w - 8*i (from the width part) plus 2*h - 8*i (from the height part) minus 4.\n\n        So: 2*w + 2*h - 16*i - 4.\n\n Then the sum over i from 0 to k-1:\n\n        total = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} [2*w+2*h-4 - 16*i]\n              = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 16 * (sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i)\n              = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 16 * (k*(k-1)//2)\n              = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n So the code can be:\n\n        Read w, h, k\n        total = k * (2*w + 2*h - 4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n However, note: the problem says k is at least 1 and at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n But wait: is the formula valid for k=0? The problem k>=1, so we don't care.\n\n Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> w=3, h=3, k=1\n        total = 1*(2*3+2*3-4) - 8*1*0 = 1*(6+6-4) = 8.\n\n Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> 1*(14+18-4) = 28.\n\n Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> 2*(14+18-4) - 8*2*1 = 2*28 - 16 = 56-16=40.\n\n But wait, there's an alternative way: we can also iterate. Since k is at most about 25 (because w,h<=100, so floor((100+1)/4)=25) but actually min(w,h) is at least 3 and at most 100, so k is at most 25. So we can also do:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            s1 = w - 4*i\n            s2 = h - 4*i\n            # The border of the rectangle s1 x s2 is 2*s1 + 2*s2 - 4, provided that s1>=2 and s2>=2 (which is ensured by the condition on k).\n            ring = 2*s1 + 2*s2 - 4\n            total += ring\n\n This iterative method is safe and clear.\n\n However, we must ensure that the iterative method does not try to compute a border for a rectangle that is too small (like 1x something). But the problem condition on k ensures that for the i-th ring (0-indexed) we have:\n        s1 = w - 4*i >= 3 (if i=k-1, then k<=floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) implies w-4*(k-1) >= 3? Not exactly: the condition is k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n        Let m = min(w, h). Then the condition is k <= (m+1)//4 (using integer floor division). Then the minimal dimension for the k-th ring is m - 4*(k-1) >= m - 4*((m+1)//4 - 1) ? \n\n        Example: w=3, h=3, k=1: m=3, (3+1)//4 = 1, then 3-4*0=3 -> ok.\n        Example: w=7, h=9, k=2: m=7, (7+1)//4=2, then 7-4*1=3 -> ok.\n\n        In fact, we require that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has both dimensions at least 3? Actually, the problem doesn't say that, but note: the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. The border requires the rectangle to have at least 2 rows and 2 columns (so that the border is non-empty). However, the problem condition ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 3 in the minimal dimension? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). Then the minimal dimension for the k-th ring is min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= 3? \n\n        Let m = min(w,h). Then the condition: k <= (m+1)//4  => 4*k <= m+1 + 3? Actually, floor((m+1)/4) is the largest integer <= (m+1)/4.\n\n        We have: m - 4*(k-1) >= 3?\n        => 4*(k-1) <= m-3\n        => k-1 <= (m-3)/4\n        => k <= (m-3)/4 + 1 = (m-3+4)/4 = (m+1)/4.\n\n        Since k is integer, k <= floor((m+1)/4). So yes, the condition ensures that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has minimal dimension at least 3.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n We can choose either method. Let's use the iterative method for clarity.\n\n However, note: the iterative method might be more straightforward and less error-prone.\n\n Code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            # The current ring is the border of the rectangle (w-4*i) x (h-4*i)\n            s1 = w - 4*i\n            s2 = h - 4*i\n            # The border: top and bottom: s1 * 2, left and right: (s2 - 2)*2? Actually, no: the border is the outer perimeter of the rectangle, which is 2*s1 + 2*s2 - 4 (because the four corners are counted twice, so we subtract 4).\n            # But wait, we can also compute as: 2*s1 + 2*s2 - 4.\n            ring = 2*s1 + 2*s2 - 4\n            total += ring\n\n        print(total)\n\n However, let me test with w=3, h=3, k=1: \n        i=0: s1=3, s2=3 -> ring=2*3+2*3-4=6+6-4=8 -> correct.\n\n But wait: there's another way to think: the border of a 3x3 is 8, which is correct.\n\n But consider a 5x5 plate, first ring (k=1): \n        ring = 2*5+2*5-4 = 10+10-4=16. \n        Alternatively, we can count: the outer ring of 5x5: \n            top row: 5, bottom row:5, left and right: 3 each (because the corners are already counted) -> 5+5+3+3=16. Correct.\n\n Now, the second ring for 5x5: k=2, then i=1: \n        s1=5-4=1, s2=5-4=1 -> ring=2*1+2*1-4=4-4=0. \n        But wait, the condition: k must be at most floor((min(5,5)+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1. So k=2 is not allowed. \n\n Therefore, the iterative method naturally stops at k=1 for 5x5.\n\n So we are safe.\n\n However, note: the problem says k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So we don't have to worry about k being too large.\n\n But what if k is 0? The problem says k>=1, so we don't handle k=0.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n        Read the input, split into w, h, k.\n        Initialize total=0.\n        For i in range(k):\n            s1 = w - 4*i\n            s2 = h - 4*i\n            ring = 2*s1 + 2*s2 - 4\n            total += ring\n\n        Print(total)\n\n Alternatively, we can use the closed form to avoid the loop (since k is at most 25, but still, sometimes closed form is preferred for performance, but 25 is small).\n\n However, the problem constraints are very small, so either way is acceptable.\n\n Let me write the closed form version for efficiency (though it's the same complexity):\n\n        total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n But wait, we had to fix the factor: we subtracted 8*k*(k-1) but in the expansion we saw that each term subtracts 16*i (so the total subtraction is 16 * (0+1+...+(k-1)) = 16 * (k*(k-1)//2) = 8*k*(k-1). \n\n So the closed form is:\n\n        total = k*(2*(w+h)-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n But wait: 2*w+2*h is the same as 2*(w+h). Then:\n\n        total = k*(2*(w+h)-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n Test with 3,3,1: 1*(2*(3+3)-4) - 0 = 1*(12-4)=8. Correct.\n\n Test with 7,9,1: 1*(2*(7+9)-4) = 1*(32-4)=28. Correct.\n\n Test with 7,9,2: 2*(2*(7+9)-4) - 8*2*1 = 2*(32-4) - 16 = 2*28 -16=56-16=40. Correct.\n\n Which one to use? Both are acceptable. Let's use the closed form for simplicity and without a loop.\n\n However, note: the closed form is algebraically equivalent. \n\n But wait: the closed form we derived is:\n\n        total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n And we can write it as:\n\n        total = 2*k*(w+h-2) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n But I'll stick to the expanded form.\n\n Code using closed form:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = k * (2*w + 2*h - 4) - 8 * k * (k-1)\n        print(total)\n\n However, wait: the example 5x5 with k=1: \n        total = 1*(2*5+2*5-4) - 0 = 20-4=16. Correct.\n\n But note: the condition k<=floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) is enforced by the problem input, so we don't have to check.\n\n However, what if k=0? The problem says k>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n But wait: what if k is 0? The problem says k>=1. So we are safe.\n\n However, the problem says: \"The only line contains three integers w, h and k (3≤w,h≤100, 1≤k≤floor((min(w,h)+1)/4))\"\n\n Therefore, we can use the closed form.\n\n But wait, let me check the derivation again: \n        term_i = 2*(w-4*i) + 2*(h-4*i) - 4 = 2*w+2*h-4 - 8*i -8*i? No, wait: 2*(w-4*i)=2*w-8*i, and 2*(h-4*i)=2*h-8*i, so together 2*w+2*h-16*i-4.\n\n Then the sum over i from 0 to k-1 is:\n\n        = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 16 * (0+1+...+(k-1))\n        = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 16 * (k*(k-1)//2)\n        = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n This is correct.\n\n However, note: the expression 0+1+...+(k-1) is k*(k-1)//2.\n\n Therefore, we can write:\n\n        total = k * (2*w + 2*h - 4) - 8 * k * (k-1)\n\n But wait, we can factor out k:\n\n        total = k * [ (2*w + 2*h - 4) - 8*(k-1) ]\n\n However, the above is the same.\n\n Let's run the code for the examples.\n\n Example: w=3, h=3, k=1 -> 1*(2*3+2*3-4) - 8*1*0 = 8.\n\n Example: w=7, h=9, k=2 -> 2*(14+18-4) - 8*2*1 = 2*28 - 16 = 56-16=40.\n\n Example: w=5, h=5, k=1 -> 1*(10+10-4) - 0 = 16.\n\n Example: w=10, h=10, k=1 -> 1*(20+20-4)=36.\n        Count manually: 10x10 plate, the border: 10*4-4=36. Correct.\n\n Example: w=10, h=10, k=2 -> \n        Condition: min(10,10)=10, floor((10+1)/4)=floor(11/4)=2 -> allowed.\n        Using formula: 2*(2*10+2*10-4) - 8*2*1 = 2*(40-4) - 16 = 2*36 -16 = 72-16=56.\n\n        Alternatively, by iteration:\n          i=0: 2*10+2*10-4=36\n          i=1: 2*(10-4)+2*(10-4)-4 = 2*6+2*6-4=12+12-4=20\n          total=36+20=56.\n\n        Correct.\n\n So I'll use the closed form.\n\n However, note: the formula for the i-th term is 2*(w-4*i)+2*(h-4*i)-4, and we are summing for i from 0 to k-1.\n\n The closed form is:\n\n        total = k*(2*w+2*h-4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n But wait, in the expansion we subtracted 16*i for each term, and the sum of i from 0 to k-1 is k*(k-1)//2, so 16 * (k*(k-1)//2) = 8*k*(k-1). \n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = k * (2 * (w + h) - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n        print(total)\n\n However, wait: 2*w+2*h is the same as 2*(w+h). So we can write:\n\n        total = k * (2 * (w + h) - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n\n But note: the order of operations: 2*(w+h) is done first, then subtract 4, then multiply by k, then subtract 8*k*(k-1).\n\n Alternatively, we can write without intermediate variable.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n However, wait: there is a possibility that the closed form might be less clear to readers. But the problem is simple.\n\n But note: the problem says the input is one line with three integers.\n\n Final code:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = k * (2 * (w + h) - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n        print(total)\n\n But wait: the example \"7 9 1\" becomes: 1*(2*(7+9)-4)=1*(32-4)=28, and \"7 9 2\" becomes 2*(32-4)-16=2*28-16=56-16=40.\n\n However, wait: the expression inside the parentheses: 2*(w+h) is 2*w+2*h, so we can also write:\n\n        total = k * (2*w + 2*h - 4) - 8*k*(k-1)\n\n This is the same.\n\n But let me check: 2*(w+h) is the same as 2*w+2*h. So it's the same.\n\n I'll choose the version without breaking the parentheses.\n\n However, there is a potential issue with operator precedence: 2*(w+h) is clear, but if we write 2*w+2*h, that is the same as 2*(w)+2*(h) due to left-to-right associativity, but addition and multiplication have the same precedence and multiplication is done first? Actually, no: * has higher precedence than +. So 2*w+2*h is parsed as (2*w)+(2*h). \n\n But 2*(w+h) is the same as 2*w+2*h.\n\n So both are the same.\n\n We can write either.\n\n I'll write:\n\n        total = k * (2 * (w + h) - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n\n But wait, the expression 2*(w+h) is computed first, then subtract 4, then multiply by k, then subtract 8*k*(k-1). \n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        total = k * (2 * w + 2 * h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n\n It's the same.\n\n Let me choose the latter because it avoids the nested parentheses.\n\n However, they are the same.\n\n But note: the problem says the input is three integers, so we read them.\n\n Code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            # But the problem says there is one line, so we assume non-empty.\n            pass\n        else:\n            w = int(data[0])\n            h = int(data[1])\n            k = int(data[2])\n\n        total = k * (2 * w + 2 * h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n        print(total)\n\n However, we can use:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = k * (2 * w + 2 * h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n        print(total)\n\n But wait: what if k=0? The problem says k>=1, so we don't need to worry.\n\n Let's submit the closed form solution.\n\n However, wait: there is a possibility of negative numbers? But k>=1, so k-1 is at least 0.\n\n But note: the condition on k: k is at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So k is positive.\n\n One more test: w=3, h=100, k= floor((3+1)/4)=1 -> total=1*(2*3+2*100-4) - 0 = 6+200-4=202.\n\n        Alternatively, the first ring: the border of 3x100 is 2*3+2*100-4=6+200-4=202. Correct.\n\n So the code is ready.\n\n However, wait: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. The first ring is the edge. Our calculation is for the entire edge. \n\n But wait: what if the plate is not square? The formula works for any w and h.\n\n Example: w=2, h= something? But the problem says w>=3, h>=3.\n\n Therefore, we are safe.\n\n I'll output the code.\n\n But wait: there's an alternative interpretation: the problem says the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Our formula subtracts 4*i from both dimensions. That is because each ring moves inward by 2 cells in both directions (so 2*2=4 per dimension). \n\n This matches the problem statement.\n\n Therefore, the final code is:\n\n        w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n        total = k * (2 * w + 2 * h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\n        print(total)\n\n However, wait: the above closed form was derived from the iterative formula. But let me verify the derivation again:\n\n        term_i = 2*(w - 4*i) + ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells away from the previous one. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the total number of cells covered by `k` concentric rings on a `w x h` grid. The first ring is the outermost border of the grid. Each subsequent ring is indented by 2 cells from the previous one, meaning its dimensions are reduced by 4 cells in both width and height (2 cells on each side).\n2. **Key Insight**: For each ring `i` (0-indexed), the inner rectangle's dimensions are `(w - 4*i) x (h - 4*i)`. The number of cells in the border of this rectangle is given by `2*(w - 4*i) + 2*(h - 4*i) - 4`.\n3. **Mathematical Formulation**: The total number of cells for all `k` rings can be derived as a closed-form expression:\n   - Total cells = `k * (2*w + 2*h - 4) - 8*k*(k - 1)`\n   This formula efficiently sums the cells of all rings without iterating through each one, leveraging arithmetic series properties.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = k * (2 * w + 2 * h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads three integers `w`, `h`, and `k` from standard input, representing the plate dimensions and the number of rings.\n2. **Closed-Form Calculation**: The formula `k * (2 * w + 2 * h - 4) - 8 * k * (k - 1)` computes the total cells by considering each ring's contribution. The term `2 * w + 2 * h - 4` calculates the cells in the first ring (the outer border). The subtraction `8 * k * (k - 1)` accounts for the cumulative reduction in dimensions and cells for each subsequent ring.\n3. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the total number of cells to be gilded across all `k` rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution in constant time, making it optimal for the given constraints.",
