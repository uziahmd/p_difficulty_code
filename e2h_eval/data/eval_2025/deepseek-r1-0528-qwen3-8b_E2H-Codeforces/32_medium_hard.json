    "thought": "\n We are to remove exactly one element from the array and minimize the instability (max-min) of the resulting array.\n\n Observation:\n Let the original array be `a` with `n` elements. The instability after removing one element is determined by the new max and min.\n\n Note: Removing an element might change the max or the min (or both).\n\n Since the array has at least 2 elements, we can consider:\n\n Let `b = sorted(a)`\n Then the original instability is `b[n-1] - b[0]`.\n\n After removing one element, the instability could be one of two cases (if we remove an element that is not the current max or min, then the min and max remain the same. But if we remove an element that is the max, then the new max becomes `b[n-2]`; similarly, if we remove the min, the new min becomes `b[1]`.)\n\n However, note: sometimes the array might have duplicate values. For example, [1, 3, 3, 7]: \n   Original: min=1, max=7, instability=6.\n   If we remove a '3', the array becomes [1,3,7] -> instability=6; [1,3,3] -> instability=2; [3,3,7] -> instability=4.\n   But note: we can also remove the 1 or the 7.\n\n Actually, we have to consider every removal. However, we cannot try every removal for n up to 10^5 (that would be O(n)) but note that we only need to consider the effect of removing one occurrence of each distinct value? \n\n Insight: The instability of the entire array without a particular element is either:\n   Option 1: Remove an element that is the minimum (then the new min is the next smallest, and the max remains the same) -> instability = (max - new_min)\n   Option 2: Remove an element that is the maximum (then the new max is the next largest, and the min remains the same) -> instability = (new_max - min)\n   Option 3: Remove an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then the min and max remain the same -> instability = (max - min)\n\n But wait: what if there are multiple minima or maxima? Then removing one of them might not necessarily change the min or max if there's still another minimum or maximum remaining.\n\n Actually, we can think of the following: the resulting array's min and max will be the min and max of the entire set without that one element.\n\n So, we can consider:\n   Let `b` be the sorted array.\n\n   We want to compute the instability for each removal and take the minimum.\n\n However, note: we cannot iterate over all n removals and compute the min and max for each (that would be O(n^2)).\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider that the overall instability is determined by the spread of the entire array. The removal of an element might help in reducing the instability if we remove an extreme value (min or max) and if there are multiple copies of the min or max, then removing one copy doesn't change the min or max.\n\n Therefore, we can consider:\n\n   Let `min_val = b[0]`, `max_val = b[-1]`\n\n   The candidate instabilities are:\n\n   Candidate 1: Remove the global minimum (if there is at least one occurrence of min_val). Then the new min is the next smallest distinct number? Not necessarily. It depends on how many min_vals there are.\n\n   Actually, let:\n     Let `left` be the first index where the element is greater than `min_val` (if any) OR if there are duplicates, then the new min is still `min_val` if there is at least one more `min_val`. So we must consider:\n\n     We can define:\n        If we remove an element `x` at position i, then the new min is:\n          If `x == min_val` and there exists at least one other `min_val` in the array (i.e., the frequency of `min_val` is more than 1), then the new min is still `min_val`.\n          Otherwise, the new min is the next smallest value (which is the first element in `b` that is not `min_val`).\n\n     Similarly for the max.\n\n   However, note: the array is sorted. So we can precompute:\n\n     Let `freq` be a dictionary of frequencies? But note: we are only concerned with the boundaries.\n\n   Actually, we don't need to know the exact frequency, we can use:\n\n     Let `first_occurrence_of_non_min` be the first index where `b[i] != min_val`. Then if we remove an element that is `min_val`, the new min is `b[first_occurrence_of_non_min]` if we remove the last `min_val`? Actually, no: we don't know which occurrence we remove.\n\n   Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n     The instability after removing an element `x` is:\n        new_min = \n          if x == min_val: then we look at the array without x. The min becomes the smallest element that is >= min_val. But note: if there are multiple min_vals, then the min remains min_val unless we remove all min_vals? But we remove one.\n\n        So: \n          new_min = min_val if there is at least one other min_val, otherwise the next distinct value.\n\n        Similarly, new_max = max_val if there is at least one other max_val, otherwise the next distinct value.\n\n   But note: we are removing one element. So:\n\n        If we remove one occurrence of `min_val` and there are `count_min` copies of `min_val`, then after removal there are `count_min - 1` copies. Then the new min is:\n            min_val if count_min - 1 > 0, else the next value (which is the smallest value greater than min_val).\n\n        Similarly for the max.\n\n   However, we don't know the frequencies? We can compute the frequency of min_val and max_val, but note: the entire array is sorted so we can do:\n\n        left_index = 0\n        while left_index < n-1 and b[left_index] == min_val:\n            left_index += 1\n        Then the first index where the value is not min_val is left_index, so if we remove one min_val, the new min is:\n            if left_index < n: then min_val (because there are still min_vals remaining) OR actually, if we remove one min_val, then the remaining array still has min_val if there was more than one.\n\n   Actually, we can determine the new min and max without knowing the frequency explicitly:\n\n        Let `min_remaining` = \n            if we remove an element that is the min_val, then the new min is:\n                min_val if (the number of min_vals) > 1, else the next distinct value (which is b[0] if we removed the only min_val? Actually, if we remove the only min_val, then the next min is the next element).\n\n        But wait, we don't know which element we remove. We are allowed to choose any one element.\n\n   We can break down the problem:\n\n        The instability without removing an element x is:\n\n            If x == min_val and there are at least two min_vals, then the min remains min_val, and the max remains max_val -> instability = max_val - min_val.\n            If x == min_val and there is only one min_val, then the new min is the next distinct value (say m') and the max remains max_val -> instability = max_val - m'.\n\n            Similarly, if x == max_val and there are at least two max_vals, then the max remains max_val, and the min remains min_val -> instability = max_val - min_val.\n            If x == max_val and there is only one max_val, then the new max is the previous distinct value (say M') and the min remains min_val -> instability = M' - min_val.\n\n            For an x that is neither min_val nor max_val, then the min and max remain the same -> instability = max_val - min_val.\n\n   However, wait: what if we remove an element that is not the min or max, but it is the only occurrence of some value in the middle? Then the min and max remain the same because the min and max are still present.\n\n   Therefore, the candidate instability values are:\n\n        candidate1 = max_val - min_val   # if we remove an element that is neither min nor max, but note: we can also get this by removing an element that is min (if there are duplicates) or max (if there are duplicates) as well.\n\n        candidate2 = max_val - (next distinct value above min_val)   # if we remove the only min_val\n        candidate3 = (previous distinct value below max_val) - min_val # if we remove the only max_val\n\n   But note: there might be more than two distinct values. However, we can compute:\n\n        Let `distinct_min` = min_val, and `distinct_max` = max_val.\n\n        To find the next distinct value above min_val (if we remove the only min_val): \n            We can traverse from the start until we find a value different from min_val. Similarly, from the end for max_val.\n\n        However, note: the array is sorted, so we can do:\n\n            Let `next_min` = None\n            for i in range(n):\n                if b[i] != min_val:\n                    next_min = b[i]\n                    break\n\n            Similarly, `prev_max` = None\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                if b[i] != max_val:\n                    prev_max = b[i]\n                    break\n\n        Then the candidate when removing the only min_val is: max_val - next_min\n        And the candidate when removing the only max_val is: prev_max - min_val\n\n        But what if we remove an element that is both the only min and the only max? (like an array with two elements: [1,1] then min_val=1, max_val=1, and then next_min and prev_max would be None? Actually, in that case, the array has only 1's. Then removing one element leaves [1] -> instability 0.\n\n        Actually, we must consider:\n\n            The instability of an array with one element is 0.\n\n        But note: the problem states that we remove exactly one element, so the resulting array has n-1 elements (which could be 1 or more). However, the problem says n>=2, so n-1>=1.\n\n        Now, if the array is [1,1] (n=2), then:\n            Removing one element: [1] -> instability 0.\n\n        How does our candidate work?\n\n            min_val = 1, max_val = 1.\n            We remove an element that is the only min? Yes, because there is only one occurrence? Actually, there are two 1's. So the frequency of 1 is 2.\n\n            Then when we remove one 1, there is still one 1 left, so the new min is 1, and the new max is 1. Then instability = 0.\n\n        So our condition for candidate2 (removing the only min_val) must be: if there is exactly one min_val, then we use next_min. But if there are multiple min_vals, then removing one min_val doesn't change the min.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            candidate_list = []\n\n            candidate_list.append(max_val - min_val)   # This is the instability if we remove an element that is not changing the min or max (i.e., not the only min or the only max, or even if it is min or max but there are duplicates, then the min/max remains)\n\n            But wait: if we remove an element that is the only min_val, then the instability is (max_val - next_min) and similarly for max.\n\n            Also, if we remove an element that is the only max_val, then the instability is (prev_max - min_val)\n\n            However, note: it is possible that the array has more than two distinct values, but we are only concerned with the boundaries.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Sort the array.\n\n            Step 2: Find the first index where the element is not min_val -> next_min_index, then next_min = b[next_min_index] if exists.\n            Step 3: Find the last index where the element is not max_val -> prev_max_index, then prev_max = b[prev_max_index] if exists.\n\n            But note: we don't need the entire array, just the next distinct value above min_val and the previous distinct value below max_val.\n\n            Actually, we can also consider: what if we remove an element that is the min_val (and there are multiple) but the min_val is duplicated? Then we don't change the min. Similarly for max.\n\n            So we can compute:\n\n                candidate1 = max_val - min_val   # This is the base candidate (if we remove an element that is not the only min or the only max, or even if it is min or max but duplicates exist)\n\n                candidate2 = max_val - next_min   # if we remove the only min_val\n                candidate3 = prev_max - min_val    # if we remove the only max_val\n\n            Then the answer is min(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n            However, wait: what if we remove an element that is the only min_val and the only max_val? Then the array has no min_val and no max_val? Actually, that would require an array of length 1? But n>=2. \n\n            Example: [1,2] \n                min_val=1, max_val=2.\n                Removing the only min_val (1) leaves [2] -> instability 0. But according to candidate2: next_min = 2, so candidate2 = 2-2 = 0.\n                Removing the only max_val (2) leaves [1] -> instability 0. candidate3 = 1-1=0.\n\n            Another example: [1,3,7] (n=3)\n                min_val=1, max_val=7.\n                Removing the only min_val (1) leaves [3,7] -> instability 4.\n                Removing the only max_val (7) leaves [1,3] -> instability 2.\n                Removing the middle element (3) leaves [1,7] -> instability 6.\n\n                candidate1 = 7-1 = 6.\n                candidate2 = 7 - 3 = 4.\n                candidate3 = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\n                Then the minimum is 2.\n\n            But wait: the example input provided: \n                Input: ['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n            For the first example: \n                Array: [1,3,3,7]\n                candidate1 = 7-1 = 6.\n                candidate2: remove the only min_val? There is only one 1, so next_min is 3 -> candidate2 = 7-3=4.\n                candidate3: remove the only max_val? There is only one 7, so prev_max is 3 -> candidate3 = 3-1=2.\n\n                Then answer = min(6,4,2)=2. Correct.\n\n            But note: what if the array has multiple min_vals and/or max_vals? \n\n            Example: [1,1,2,3] (min_val=1, max_val=3)\n                Removing one 1: the min remains 1, so candidate for removal of 1 is 3-1=2.\n                Removing the 2: candidate is 3-1=2.\n                Removing the 3: the max remains 3? No, because there is only one 3, so removing 3 gives max=2 -> instability 2-1=1.\n                Removing the other 1: same as above.\n\n                candidate1: 3-1=2.\n                candidate2: if we remove the only min_val? Actually, there are two 1's, so we don't use candidate2 (because we don't remove the only min_val) OR we should consider: we can remove one min_val and there are duplicates, so the min remains. Then we don't get candidate2 from removing a min_val? \n\n            Correction: We must consider two types of removals:\n\n                Type A: Removal of an element that is the min_val (and there are duplicates) -> then the min remains, so the instability is max_val - min_val (same as candidate1).\n                Type B: Removal of an element that is the max_val (and there are duplicates) -> then the max remains, so the instability is max_val - min_val (same as candidate1).\n\n                But wait: if we remove an element that is the min_val and there are duplicates, then the instability is still max_val - min_val. Similarly for max.\n\n                The only time we get a change is when we remove the only occurrence of the min_val (making the min become the next distinct value) or the only occurrence of the max_val (making the max become the previous distinct value).\n\n            Therefore, we can reframe:\n\n                candidate1 = max_val - min_val   # This is the instability if we remove an element that is not the only min or the only max.\n\n                candidate2 = (if the frequency of min_val is 1) then (max_val - next_min) else candidate1   [But wait, if we remove a non-min element, then the min remains, so we don't get candidate2 from removing a non-min?]\n\n            Actually, we are allowed to choose any element. So we have two special cases: removing the only min_val, and removing the only max_val.\n\n            But note: we might have an array with only one distinct value (all the same). Then:\n\n                min_val = max_val = x.\n                Then removing one element: the array becomes [x, x, ..., x] (n-1 times). Then the instability is 0.\n\n                candidate1 = x - x = 0.\n                candidate2: if we remove the only min_val? Actually, the frequency of min_val is n, which is >1, so we don't use candidate2 (because we don't remove the only min_val) -> candidate2 is not defined, but we don't need it because candidate1 already covers the case of removing any element.\n\n            However, note: if we remove an element that is the min_val (and there are duplicates) then the min remains, so the instability is 0. Similarly, if we remove an element that is the max_val (and there are duplicates) then the max remains, so the instability is 0.\n\n            But wait: in the all-same array, the candidate1 is 0, and that is the answer.\n\n            Now, what if the array has two distinct values? [1,2,2,3] (min_val=1, max_val=3, and next_min=2, prev_max=2)\n\n                Removing the only min_val (1) -> instability = 3-2 = 1.\n                Removing the only max_val (3) -> instability = 2-1 = 1.\n                Removing a 2: the min is 1 and max is 3, so instability=2.\n\n                candidate1 = 3-1=2.\n                candidate2 = 3-2=1 (since we remove the only min_val) -> but wait, is 1 the only min_val? Yes, so candidate2=1.\n                candidate3 = 2-1=1.\n\n                Then the minimum is 1.\n\n            But note: we can also remove a 2 (non-min and non-max) and then the instability is 2 (which is worse). So the best is 1.\n\n            So the algorithm:\n\n                Sort the array.\n\n                Let min_val = b[0], max_val = b[-1]\n\n                Let next_min = None\n                i = 0\n                while i < n and b[i] == min_val:\n                    i += 1\n                if i < n:\n                    next_min = b[i]\n\n                Let prev_max = None\n                j = n-1\n                while j >= 0 and b[j] == max_val:\n                    j -= 1\n                if j >= 0:\n                    prev_max = b[j]\n\n                Now, we have three candidates:\n\n                candidate1 = max_val - min_val   # This is the base candidate (when we remove an element that is not the only min or the only max)\n\n                candidate2 = float('inf')\n                candidate3 = float('inf')\n\n                # Check if there is a unique min (only one occurrence of min_val)\n                # But note: we don't have the full frequency, but we can check the first segment of min_vals.\n\n                # How many min_vals?\n                count_min = 0\n                k = 0\n                while k < n and b[k] == min_val:\n                    count_min += 1\n                    k += 1\n\n                # Similarly, count_max = n - k?

However, if we remove an element that is not the only min_val, then the min remains, so the instability is candidate1.\n                    # Similarly for max.\n                    pass\n\n                if count_max == 1:\n                    candidate3 = prev_max - min_val\n                else:\n                    pass\n\n                Then the answer is min(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n            However, wait: candidate1 is always available (by removing an element that is not the only min and not the only max). But note: we can also remove an element that is the only min_val and get candidate2, or the only max_val and get candidate3.\n\n            But note: we must consider that if we remove an element that is the only min_val, we don't necessarily get candidate1. Similarly for candidate3.\n\n            However, we are taking the minimum of candidate1, candidate2, candidate3.\n\n            But what if we remove an element that is the only min_val and the only max_val? Then we have candidate2 and candidate3, but note: if the array has only two distinct values, and we remove the only min_val (which is also the only max_val?) then that element must be the only one of both? Actually, if the array is [1,2] then removing the 1: then the min becomes 2 (so next_min is 2) and the max remains 2, so instability=0. Similarly, removing the 2: then the max becomes 1, so instability=0.\n\n            But wait: in [1,2] the min_val=1, max_val=2, and next_min=2, prev_max=1.\n\n            Then candidate1 = 2-1=1.\n            candidate2: count_min=1 -> candidate2 = 2-2=0.\n            candidate3: count_max=1 -> candidate3 = 1-1=0.\n\n            Then the minimum is 0.\n\n            That is correct.\n\n            However, consider: [1,2,3] \n                min_val=1, max_val=3, next_min=2, prev_max=2.\n\n                count_min=1 -> candidate2 = 3-2=1.\n                count_max=1 -> candidate3 = 2-1=1.\n\n                candidate1=3-1=2.\n\n                Then answer=min(2,1,1)=1.\n\n            But let's verify: \n                Removing 1: [2,3] -> instability=1.\n                Removing 2: [1,3] -> instability=2.\n                Removing 3: [1,2] -> instability=1.\n\n            So the minimum is 1. Correct.\n\n            But wait: what if the array is [1,2,3,4]?\n                candidate1=4-1=3.\n                candidate2: count_min=1 -> candidate2=4-2=2.\n                candidate3: count_max=1 -> candidate3=3-1=2.\n\n                Then answer=2.\n\n            Let's check:\n                Remove 1: [2,3,4] -> instability=4-2=2.\n                Remove 2: [1,3,4] -> instability=4-1=3.\n                Remove 3: [1,2,4] -> instability=4-1=3.\n                Remove 4: [1,2,3] -> instability=3-1=2.\n\n            So indeed, the minimum is 2.\n\n            However, note: what if we remove an element that is not the min or max? Then the instability remains 3. But we are taking the minimum over the three candidates.\n\n            But note: we must consider that removing an element that is not the only min or the only max (like 2 or 3) might not give the minimum. We are only considering three candidates:\n\n                candidate1: the base candidate (which is the original instability) is achieved by removing an element that is not the only min and not the only max? Actually, no: if we remove an element that is the min_val (but there are duplicates) then the instability remains candidate1. Similarly for max_val.\n\n            However, note: candidate1 is the original instability, but if we remove an element that is the only min_val, then the instability changes. Similarly for the only max_val.\n\n            But wait: candidate1 is computed as the original instability (without removal) and we are using it as the candidate for removal of an element that is not the only min or the only max? Actually, that's not entirely accurate.\n\n            Actually, if we remove an element that is not the only min and not the only max, then the instability remains the same as the original? \n\n            Example: [1,1,2,3] (min_val=1, max_val=3)\n                Original instability: 3-1=2.\n\n                Removing a non-min and non-max (the 2) leaves [1,1,3] -> instability=3-1=2 (same).\n                Removing one of the 1's (min_val, but not the only one) leaves [1,2,3] -> instability=3-1=2 (same).\n                Removing the 3 (max_val, but not the only one) leaves [1,1,2] -> instability=2-1=1? Wait, no: the min is 1, the max is 2 -> instability=1.\n\n            So wait, we must account for: \n\n                Removing an element that is the max_val (even if there are duplicates) does not necessarily leave the max unchanged. Actually, if we remove one occurrence of the max_val, then the new max is the next distinct value below max_val (if there are duplicates, then the max remains the same). \n\n            Correction: \n\n                The min and max of the array without an element x:\n\n                The min is the smallest value in the array that is >= min_val (unless we remove all min_vals, then the smallest value greater than min_val becomes the min). Similarly for the max.\n\n                But note: if there are duplicates, then removing one occurrence of the min_val does not change the min if there is at least one other min_val. Similarly for max.\n\n            Therefore, the instability after removal is:\n\n                new_min = \n                    if we remove an element that is min_val and there is no other min_val, then the next distinct value (which is the smallest value greater than min_val) OR if we remove an element that is min_val and there is another min_val, then min_val.\n                    Otherwise (we didn't remove a min_val) then min_val.\n\n                Similarly for max.\n\n            However, we don't know which element we remove. We are trying to minimize the instability.\n\n            We can consider:\n\n                candidate1: the original instability (max_val - min_val) is achieved if we remove an element that is not the only min_val and not the only max_val? Actually, no: because if we remove an element that is the max_val (and there are duplicates) then the max remains the same, so the instability remains the same. Similarly, if we remove an element that is the min_val (and duplicates) then the min remains the same.\n\n                But if we remove an element that is the max_val and there is only one max_val, then the instability changes.\n\n            So we can compute:\n\n                candidate1 = max_val - min_val   # This candidate is achieved if we remove an element that is not the only min and not the only max, OR if we remove a min_val (with duplicates) OR a max_val (with duplicates) then the instability remains the same.\n\n                candidate2 = (if there is exactly one min_val) then (max_val - next_min) else candidate1   # This is the instability if we remove the only min_val.\n\n                candidate3 = (if there is exactly one max_val) then (prev_max - min_val) else candidate1   # This is the instability if we remove the only max_val.\n\n            Then the answer is min(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n            But wait: what if we remove an element that is the only min_val and the only max_val? Then we have both candidate2 and candidate3. But note: an element cannot be both the only min and the only max unless the array has one element (which is not allowed) or two elements: [x,y] with x<y, then the min is x and the max is y, and they are distinct. So an element cannot be both the only min and the only max unless the array is of length 1 (which we don't have) or if the array has two same elements? Then min_val = max_val, and then we are removing the only occurrence of that value (which is the entire array) but wait: the array has two same elements, then we have two copies. So in that case, there are duplicates.\n\n            Actually, if the array has two same elements, then the min_val = max_val, and then:\n\n                candidate1 = 0 (since max_val-min_val=0)\n                candidate2: if the frequency of min_val is 2, then candidate2 is not defined (we don't use it) -> candidate2 = candidate1 (we skip candidate2 because the condition fails) -> so we use candidate1.\n                candidate3: same.\n\n            So the algorithm:\n\n                Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n                Step 2: Sort the list.\n                Step 3: Let min_val = a[0], max_val = a[-1].\n                Step 4: Count the frequency of min_val (from the beginning until the value changes) and max_val (from the end until the value changes).\n\n                Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                    count_min = 1\n                    i = 1\n                    while i < n and a[i] == min_val:\n                        count_min += 1\n                        i += 1\n\n                    count_max = 1\n                    j = n-2\n                    while j>=0 and a[j]==max_val:\n                        count_max += 1\n                        j -= 1\n\n                Step 5: Find next_min and prev_max:\n\n                    i = 0\n                    while i < n and a[i] == min_val:\n                        i += 1\n                    if i < n:\n                        next_min = a[i]\n                    else:\n                        next_min = None   # This case should not happen if n>=2 and we have sorted array, but if n==1 then we don't have next_min, but n>=2.\n\n                    j = n-1\n                    while j>=0 and a[j]==max_val:\n                        j -= 1\n                    if j>=0:\n                        prev_max = a[j]\n                    else:\n                        prev_max = None\n\n                Step 6: candidate1 = max_val - min_val\n\n                candidate2 = candidate1\n                candidate3 = candidate1\n\n                if count_min == 1:\n                    # Then removing the only min_val: the new min becomes next_min (if exists) and the max remains max_val (unless we also remove the only max_val? But note: we are only removing one element. But if the array is [1,2] then removing 1: the max remains 2, but if the array is [1,3] (with two distinct values) then yes. However, if the array is [1,1,1,2] then removing the only 1? Actually, wait: we counted count_min as 3, so we wouldn't be here. So we are only in this branch if there is exactly one min_val.\n\n                    # Then the new min is next_min, so instability = max_val - next_min\n                    candidate2 = max_val - next_min\n\n                if count_max == 1:\n                    # Then removing the only max_val: the new max becomes prev_max, so instability = prev_max - min_val\n                    candidate3 = prev_max - min_val\n\n                Answer = min(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n            But wait: what if we remove an element that is the only min_val and the array has multiple distinct values, but the max_val is not the only max_val? Then the max remains the same, so candidate2 = max_val - next_min.\n\n            Example: [1,2,2,3] -> min_val=1, max_val=3, next_min=2, prev_max=2, count_min=1, count_max=1 (because the last element is 3, and the second last is 2, so we break and count_max=1). Then candidate2 = 3-2=1, candidate3=2-1=1, candidate1=2.\n\n            However, we must consider: what if we remove an element that is the min_val (and there is only one) and the max_val is not the only one? Then the max remains the same. So candidate2 is correct.\n\n            But note: what if the array is [1,2,3,3]? \n                min_val=1, max_val=3, count_min=1, count_max=2.\n\n                candidate1 = 3-1=2.\n                candidate2 = 3 - (next_min=2) = 1.\n                candidate3 = since count_max>1, we don't update candidate3 (so candidate3 remains 2).\n\n                Then the answer is min(2,1,2)=1.\n\n            Let's verify: \n                Remove the 1: [2,3,3] -> min=2, max=3 -> instability=1.

But wait, an element cannot be both the min and the max unless the entire array is the same. In that case, we already handled (min_val==max_val) and then candidate1=0, and we don't update candidate2 or candidate3 because count_min and count_max are greater than 1 (if there are duplicates) or if not, then we update candidate2 and candidate3 to 0.\n\n            Example: [1,1,2,2] -> min_val=1, max_val=2, count_min=2, count_max=2.\n                candidate1=2-1=1.\n                candidate2 and candidate3 remain 1.\n\n                Then answer=1.\n\n            But wait: \n                Removing one 1: [1,2,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability=1.\n                Removing one 2: [1,1,2] -> min=1, max=2 -> instability=1.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            However, note: we must be cautious about the definitions of next_min and prev_max.\n\n            In [1,1,2,2]:\n                next_min: first element that is not 1 -> index2: 2.\n                prev_max: last element that is not 2 -> index1: 1.\n\n            But we don't use candidate2 and candidate3 because counts are not 1.\n\n            Therefore, the code:\n\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                a.sort()\n\n                min_val = a[0]\n                max_val = a[-1]\n\n                # Count the frequency of min_val from the start\n                count_min = 1\n                i = 1\n                while i < n and a[i] == min_val:\n                    count_min += 1\n                    i += 1\n\n                # Count the frequency of",

The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the new minimum and maximum values after removing an element.\n2. **Identify Key Elements**: The original minimum (`min_val`) and maximum (`max_val`) values are identified from the sorted array.\n3. **Count Frequencies**: The number of occurrences of `min_val` and `max_val` is counted to determine if they are unique in the array.\n4. **Determine Next and Previous Values**: The next value greater than `min_val` and the previous value less than `max_val` are found to handle cases where the minimum or maximum is removed (and there are no duplicates).\n5. **Calculate Candidates**: Three candidate values for the minimum instability are considered:\n   - **Candidate1**: The original instability (`max_val - min_val`), which remains unchanged if the removed element is not the only occurrence of `min_val` or `max_val`.\n   - **Candidate2**: The instability after removing the only occurrence of `min_val` (if it exists), calculated as `max_val - next_min`.\n   - **Candidate3**: The instability after removing the only occurrence of `max_val` (if it exists), calculated as `prev_max - min_val`.\n6. **Result**: The minimum among the three candidates is chosen as the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    min_val = a[0]\n    max_val = a[-1]\n    \n    count_min = 1\n    i = 1\n    while i < n and a[i] == min_val:\n        count_min += 1\n        i += 1\n        \n    count_max = 1\n    j = n - 2\n    while j >= 0 and a[j] == max_val:\n        count_max += 1\n        j -= 1\n        \n    next_min = None\n    k = 0\n    while k < n and a[k] == min_val:\n        k += 1\n    if k < n:\n        next_min = a[k]\n        \n    prev_max = None\n    l = n - 1\n    while l >= 0 and a[l] == max_val:\n        l -= 1\n    if l >= 0:\n        prev_max = a[l]\n        \n    candidate1 = max_val - min_val\n    \n    candidate2 = candidate1\n    candidate3 = candidate1\n    \n    if count_min == 1:\n        candidate2 = max_val - next_min\n        \n    if count_max == 1:\n        candidate3 = prev_max - min_val\n        \n    ans = min(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.\n2. **Frequency Counting**: The code counts how many times the smallest and largest elements appear. This helps in determining if removing one occurrence will change the minimum or maximum of the array.\n3. **Finding Adjacent Values**: The next value after the smallest element and the previous value before the largest element are identified to compute the new instability if the smallest or largest element is removed.\n4. **Candidate Calculation**: The three candidate values for the minimum instability are computed. These candidates represent scenarios where the smallest or largest element is removed (and they are unique) or when removing any other element leaves the instability unchanged.\n5. **Result Determination**: The smallest value among the three candidates is selected as the result, ensuring the minimal possible instability after removing one element from the array. This approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging sorting and careful analysis of boundary conditions.",
