Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers A, B, C, D (with 1<=A<=B<=C<=D<=500000) and we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles (x,y,z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nThe triangle condition for sides (x,y,z) is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. However, note that we have fixed ordering: \n   x <= y <= z.\n\nIn a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the only condition we need to check is: x + y > z.\n\nBut note: our sides are constrained by intervals: x in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D].\n\nWe can break down the problem:\n\nLet x, y, z be integers with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D, and we require x+y>z.\n\nWe can iterate over x and y, but note the ranges can be up to 500000, so iterating over x from A to B and y from B to C would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which can be too slow (e.g., if A=1, B=500000, then x has 500000 values, and if C-B+1 is also large, it would be 500000*500000 = 250e9, which is too slow in Python).\n\nWe need a more efficient method.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can fix z (from C to D) and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, with x in [A, B] and y in [B, C]. But note: we also have the constraints that x<=y and y<=C, and note that x<=B and y>=B (so actually x<=B<=y) so the condition x<=y is automatically satisfied? Actually, note: the input conditions say A<=B<=C<=D, and we have A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So indeed x<=B<=y, so x<=y.\n\nBut wait: the condition x<=y is given by the ranges. So we can assume x<=y.\n\nNow, the triangle condition is x+y>z.\n\nWe can also note that for a fixed z, the condition becomes x+y>z, with x in [A, B] and y in [B, min(C, z)]? Actually, note that y must be at least B and at most C, and also since we require x+y>z and x>=A, then y must be at least max(B, z - x_min + 1) but wait, we can do:\n\nFor fixed z, we want:\n   x+y > z, with x in [A, B] and y in [B, C].\n\nBut note: since x<=B and y>=B, then the smallest x+y is A+B (if A+B>B then we have x+y >= A+B, but note A<=B so A+B <= 2B). However, the condition might fail for some x and y.\n\nActually, we can think: for fixed z, we need to count the pairs (x,y) such that:\n   x in [A, B], y in [B, C] and x+y>z.\n\nBut note: we can split the condition on y: for a fixed x, we need y > z - x. Since y is at least B, we require y from max(B, floor(z-x)+1) to C (if floor(z-x)+1 <= C). Also, note that x+y>z implies y>z-x, so the smallest integer y is floor(z-x)+1.\n\nBut then we can iterate over x from A to B and for each x, set y_low = max(B, z - x + 1) and then count the y's from y_low to C (if y_low <= C).\n\nHowever, we cannot iterate over z from C to D and then over x from A to B (which is about 500000 * 500000 again).\n\nWe need to reverse the thinking.\n\nLet me consider:\n\nTotal pairs (x,y) without the triangle condition: (B-A+1) * (C-B+1). Then subtract the pairs that do not satisfy x+y>z? But note: we have different z from C to D.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix x and y and then find the range of z that satisfies the condition. But note the condition is x+y>z, so z < x+y. And z is in [C, D]. So for a given",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The key insight here is recognizing that for three sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) (with \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\)) to form a non-degenerate triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triplets \\((x, y, z)\\) within the given ranges where the triangle inequality holds. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach would be infeasible due to the large possible range sizes (up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\)).\n2. **Key Insight**: For each possible \\(z\\) (from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\)), determine the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\), \\(x\\) is in \\([A, B]\\), and \\(y\\) is in \\([B, C]\\). This transforms the problem into efficiently counting valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) for each \\(z\\).\n3. **Efficient Counting**: For each \\(z\\), the condition \\(x + y > z\\) can be rewritten as \\(y > z - x\\). For each \\(x\\) in \\([A, B]\\), the valid \\(y\\) values are those greater than \\(z - x\\) and within \\([B, C]\\). By iterating over \\(x\\) and using prefix sums, we can quickly compute the number of valid \\(y\\) values for each \\(x\\) and \\(z\\).\n4. **Prefix Sum Optimization**: Precompute prefix sums for the range \\([B, C]\\) to allow quick calculation of the number of valid \\(y\\) values for any given lower bound derived from \\(z - x\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    n = C - B + 1\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + 1\n        \n    total_triangles = 0\n    for z in range(C, D + 1):\n        low_bound = z - B + 1\n        if low_bound <= B:\n            start_y = B\n        else:\n            start_y = max(B, low_bound + 1)\n            \n        if start_y > C:\n            continue\n            \n        end_y = C\n        count_y = prefix[C - B] - prefix[start_y - B - 1] if start_y - 1 >= B else prefix[C - B]\n        if start_y - 1 < B:\n            count_y = prefix[C - B]\n        else:\n            count_y = prefix[C - B] - (prefix[start_y - 1 - B] if start_y - 1 - B >= 0 else 0)\n        \n        total_triangles += count_y\n        \n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: A prefix sum array is constructed for the range \\([B, C]\\) to facilitate quick counting of valid \\(y\\) values later.\n3. **Iterating Over \\(z\\)**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), the algorithm calculates the minimum \\(y\\) value required to satisfy \\(x + y > z\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\([A, B]\\). This is done by determining the lower bound for \\(y\\) as \\(z - x + 1\\).\n4. **Counting Valid \\(y\\) Values**: Using the prefix sum array, the algorithm counts how many \\(y\\) values in \\([B, C]\\) are greater than the calculated lower bound. This count is added to the total number of valid triangles.\n5. **Output Result**: The total count of valid triangles is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to manageable computations by leveraging mathematical insights and prefix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for large input ranges.",
