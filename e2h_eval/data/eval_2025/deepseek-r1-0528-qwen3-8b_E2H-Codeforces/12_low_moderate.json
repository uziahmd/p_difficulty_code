The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of m integers (the task locations)\n Since the houses are arranged in a ring (clockwise) and we start at house 1, we can think of the ring as:\n   House numbers: 1, 2, ..., n, and then it wraps around.\n\n Important: The problem states that Xenia must complete tasks in the given order, and for the i-th task she must be at house a_i and have completed all previous tasks.\n\n We note that moving from one house to a neighboring one takes 1 unit. So the distance from house x to house y in a clockwise ring of n houses is:\n   If x <= y: distance = y - x\n   Else: distance = n - x + y   [because we go from x to n, then from n to 1 and then to y? Actually, no: we can only move clockwise. \n        Alternatively, we can compute the clockwise distance from x to y as: (y - x) mod n, but ensuring non-negative and if negative, add n and subtract 1? \n\n However, note: we are allowed to traverse the entire ring. But since we are starting at 1 and the tasks are given in order, we can break down the journey:\n\n Example: n=4, tasks = [3, 2, 3]\n\n Steps:\n   Start at 1.\n   Then go to 3: from 1 to 3: 1->2->3, so 2 steps. Then from 3 to 2: but wait, from 3 to 2 in a clockwise ring? \n        Actually, the ring is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...\n        So from 3 to 2: we cannot go backwards. We must go from 3 to 4, then 4 to 1, then 1 to 2? That would be 3 steps. But wait, the example output is 6.\n\n Let's recount the example: \n   They say: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. \n   How many moves? \n        From 1 to 2: 1\n        From 2 to 3: 2\n        From 3 to 4: 3\n        From 4 to 1: 4\n        From 1 to 2: 5\n        From 2 to 3: 6\n\n However, note that the example says \"This is optimal sequence\" and the total time is 6.\n\n But wait, the example input is: \n        Input: \"4 3\\n3 2 3\"\n\n Why did they choose to go from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2 to 3? Why not from 3 to 2 by going backwards? \n Because the ringroad is one-way and clockwise. So you can't go from 3 to 2 directly. You must go from 3 to 4, then 4 to 1, then 1 to 2.\n\n Therefore, the distance from house x to house y (with x and y between 1 and n) in a clockwise ring is:\n        If x <= y: d = y - x\n        Else: d = (n - x) + y\n\n But wait, let's test from 3 to 2: \n        x=3, y=2: since 3>2, then d = (4-3) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 -> which matches.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the clockwise distance from x to y as:\n        d = (y - x) % n   but that doesn't work because (2-3)%4 = (-1)%4 = 3, and indeed 3 is the distance.\n\n However, note: the modulus operation for positive modulo might not be the standard way because we want the minimal clockwise steps.\n\n Actually, we can use: \n        d = (y - x) % n   if (y-x) is negative, then we get a positive value. But wait, we want the clockwise distance. \n\n But note: In modular arithmetic, the clockwise distance from x to y is (y - x) mod n, but when negative we adjust by adding n.\n\n However, we can also define:\n        d = (y - x) if y>=x else (y - x + n)\n\n But note: if y==x, then d=0.\n\n Alternatively, we can use: \n        d = (y - x) % n   but this gives negative if y < x, so we can do:\n        d = (y - x) % n\n        But wait, if y < x, then (y-x) is negative, and (y-x) % n = (y-x +",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks by moving along a ring-shaped road where houses are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. For each task, she needs to be at a specific house. The challenge is to compute the minimal time required to move from her current position to the next task's location, considering the ring structure (i.e., moving clockwise only).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The distance between two houses x and y on a ring of size n can be calculated as:\n   - If y ≥ x, the distance is (y - x).\n   - If y < x, the distance is (n - x + y). This accounts for moving from x to the end of the ring (house n) and then from house 1 to house y.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Start at house 1.\n   - For each subsequent task location, calculate the clockwise distance from the current position to the next task's location.\n   - Sum these distances to get the total time required.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, leading to a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    tasks = list(map(int, data[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        a = tasks[i]\n        if a >= current:\n            total_time += a - current\n        else:\n            total_time += (n - current + a)\n        current = a\n        \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses (n), the number of tasks (m), and the list of task locations.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1, with total time initialized to 0.\n3. **Processing Tasks**: For each task location:\n   - If the task location is greater than or equal to the current position, move directly to it by adding the difference (a - current) to the total time.\n   - If the task location is less than the current position, move to the end of the ring (house n) and then from house 1 to the task location. The distance is calculated as (n - current + a) and added to the total time.\n4. **Output**: After processing all tasks, the total time is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the minimal time by leveraging the ring structure and ensures optimal performance even for large inputs.",
