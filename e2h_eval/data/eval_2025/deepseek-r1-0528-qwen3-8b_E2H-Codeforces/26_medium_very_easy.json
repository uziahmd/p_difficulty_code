    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers A, B, C, D (with 1<=A<=B<=C<=D<=500000) and we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles (x,y,z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nThe triangle condition for sides (x, y, z) is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.\nBut note: We have x<=y<=z (because A<=B<=C and so x<=y<=z). Therefore, the most restrictive condition is x+y>z.\n\nWe can think of it as:\n   For fixed x in [A, B], y in [B, C] and z in [C, D] with the condition x+y>z.\n\nHowever, iterating over all x, y, z would be too slow because the ranges can be up to 500000.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can fix x and y, then count the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x+y. But note that z must be at least C and at most D, and also note that since x<=y<=z, we have x+y>=z+? Actually, the condition is x+y>z, so z must be less than x+y.\n\nBut note: because x<=y<=z, we have z>=y, so we require z < x+y and z>=C. So for a fixed (x,y), the valid z's are from max(C, y) to min(D, x+y-1) but wait: actually, the condition is z < x+y and z>=C. However, note that since y<=z, we must have z>=y, so the lower bound is max(y, C) but wait: the problem says B<=y<=C and C<=z<=D, so z>=C (which is >=y because y<=C). So the lower bound for z is C, and the upper bound is min(D, x+y-1).\n\nBut note: the condition for a triangle requires x+y>z, so z must be strictly less than x+y. Also, we have z>=C (from the input constraints). Therefore, for a fixed (x,y), the z must be in [C, min(D, x+y-1)].\n\nSo the number of z for (x,y) is: \n   Let L = C, R = min(D, x+y-1)\n   If L <= R, then the count is (R - L + 1); otherwise 0.\n\nThen the total count is the sum over x from A to B, and for each x, sum over y from B to min(C, x+y condition?) but wait: note that y goes from B to C, but we also have to consider that for a fixed x, the condition on y might be more restrictive? Actually, we can do:\n\n   total = 0\n   for x in range(A, B+1):\n        for y in range(B, C+1):\n            # Then for this (x,y), count the number of z in [C, min(D, x+y-1)]\n            low_z = C\n            high_z = min(D, x+y-1)\n            if high_z >= low_z:\n                total += (high_z - low_z + 1)\n\nBut this is O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)) which can be about (500000)^2, which is 25e10, too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient way.\n\nLet's change the order: fix x and then y, but we can precompute or use mathematical formulas.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix the side z first and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and x<=B, y<=C, and also note that x<=y and y<=z (but wait, the problem does not require x<=y<=z? Actually, the condition is A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D, so x<=B<=y<=C<=z, so indeed x<=y<=z.\n\nWait, but the triangle condition is x+y>z. And we have x<=y<=z, so the condition is the same as x+y>z.\n\nNow, we can also fix z and count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and x<=y<=z (but note: the condition is y<=C and C<=z, so y<=z is automatically satisfied because y<=C<=z). So we only have to consider x in [A,B] and y in [B, C] and x+y>z.\n\nBut note: we have to satisfy x<=y. The constraints say x<=B<=y, so x<=y is given.\n\nNow, if we fix z (from C to D), then we need to count the number of pairs (x,y) with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=min(C, z) [actually, y is from B to C, but also we require y<=z? But note: the condition is y<=C and C<=z, so y<=z is always true because y<=C and C<=z. So y runs from B to C, and x from A to B, and we require x+y>z.\n\nBut wait, the problem does not require y<=z explicitly, but we have y<=C and C<=z, so y<=C<=z, so indeed y<=z.\n\nSo for fixed z, we need:\n   x+y > z, with x in [A, B], y in [B, C].\n\nWe can rewrite: x+y>z => x > z - y.\n\nBut note that x is at least A, so we require x in the interval [max(A, floor(z-y)+1), B] (if there is any). Similarly, for y, we can iterate over y from B to min(C, z) [but note: y<=C<=z, so we just use [B, C]].\n\nBut then we can do:\n\n   total = 0\n   for z in range(C, D+1):\n        # Count pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, with x in [A,B], y in [B,C]\n        # We can fix y and then x must be > z-y, i.e., x >= max(A, floor(z-y)+1) and x<=B.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can precompute the number of pairs (x,y) for the entire rectangle and subtract those that don't satisfy x+y>z.\n\nBut note: we can also use two pointers or cumulative sums.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix y and then the condition on x is x > z-y. Since x is from A to B, the condition is x >= max(A, floor(z-y)+1) to B.\n\nBut then we need to do for each z and for each y from B to C, and then check the x range. That would be O((D-C+1)*(C-B+1)) which is again too slow.\n\nAnother idea: use two-dimensional prefix sums?\n\nBut note: the conditions are independent for x and y, but we have a linear constraint (x+y>z). \n\nWe can precompute a 2D grid for x and y? But x and y go up to 500000, so we cannot build a 2D array of size 500000x500000.\n\nWe need to reframe the problem.\n\nLet me try to fix the two smaller sides and then the largest side must be less than x+y, but here we have three sides with x<=y<=z.\n\nActually, we are counting triangles with sides (x,y,z) where x in [A,B], y in [B,C], z in [C,D] and x+y>z.\n\nBut note: the condition for a triangle is the strict inequality. Since x,y,z are integers, the condition is x+y>=z+1.\n\nWe can count the total number of triples (x,y,z) without the triangle condition and then subtract the ones that do not satisfy x+y>z? But the total without condition is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1). Then subtract the cases where x+y<=z. But that might be harder.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix the two smaller sides (x,y) and then the largest side (z) must be in [C, min(D, x+y-1)]. But then we are back to the original.\n\nBut note: we can swap the summation: instead of iterating over x and y, we can use the fact that the condition is x+y>z, and then for each z, we want the pairs (x,y) with x+y>z, then sum over z.\n\nHow to count the pairs (x,y) for a fixed z quickly?\n\nWe have x in [A, B] and y in [B, C]. We require x+y > z.\n\nWe can precompute an array for the x values: let F(x) = 1 for x in [A, B] and 0 otherwise. Similarly, for y in [B, C] we have G(y)=1.\n\nThen the condition is x+y>z. We can use two pointers for y and then for each y, the condition on x is x>z-y. Then the number of x in [A,B] that are > (z-y) is: \n   Let L = max(A, z-y+1), then if L<=B, then the count for x is (B - L + 1), else 0.\n\nBut then we have to do this for each y from B to C and for each z from C to D.\n\nBut the total work is (D-C+1) * (C-B+1) which is (D-C+1) can be up to 500000 and (C-B+1) up to 500000, so worst-case 25e10, which is too slow.\n\nWe need to optimize further.\n\nLet me change the order: for each z, we need to count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z. This is equivalent to the total pairs (x,y) (without condition) minus the pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z.\n\nBut the total pairs (x,y) is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). \n\nNow, how to count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y<=z quickly for each z?\n\nWe can precompute an array for all possible s = x+y (for x in [A,B] and y in [B,C]) and then use a frequency array for the sums. Then we can use a Fenwick tree or prefix sums.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Precompute the minimum and maximum sum: \n   min_sum = A+B (since x>=A, y>=B, and A<=B so smallest sum is A+B)\n   max_sum = B+C (since x<=B, y<=C)\n\nBut note: our x and y are independent. However, we can compute the frequency of each sum s from min_sum to max_sum.\n\nThen for a fixed z, the condition x+y<=z is the sum of frequencies for s from min_sum to min(max_sum, z).\n\nBut note: z can be as large as D (which is up to 500000) and our max_sum is B+C (which is <= 1000000). So we can precompute an array for all sums from min_sum to max_sum.\n\nBut note: the total distinct sums is (max_sum-min_sum+1) which is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1) which can be up to 500000, so acceptable.\n\nHow to compute the frequency array for x+y?\n\nWe can do:\n\n   Let F[s] = number of pairs (x,y) such that x+y = s, with x in [A,B] and y in [B,C].\n\nBut note: x+y = s => y = s-x, and we require x in [A,B] and y=s-x in [B,C].\n\nSo for a fixed s, the x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] and also s-x must be between B and C.\n\nBut note: the condition for x is:\n   x >= A, x<=B, and\n   s-C <= x <= s-B, and also x<=s-B (so that y=s-x>=B) and x>=s-C (so that y=s-x<=C).\n\nBut note: the condition y=s-x must be between B and C: \n   B <= s-x <= C  =>  s-C <= x <= s-B.\n\nAnd we also have x in [A, B]. So x must be in [L, R] where:\n   L = max(A, s-C)\n   R = min(B, s-B)\n\nThen if L <= R, then the count is (R - L + 1), else 0.\n\nBut we have to do this for every s from min_sum to max_sum. However, the number of s is (max_sum-min_sum+1) which is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1) which is up to 500000, and for each s we do a constant time check. So that is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we are going to use this frequency array for s from min_sum to max_sum, and then we want to answer queries for each z (from C to D): \n   Count = (total pairs) - (sum_{s=min_sum}^{min(max_sum, z)} F[s])\n\nBut wait, the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, so we want the pairs with x+y>z, which is the total pairs minus the pairs with x+y<=z.\n\nBut note: the pairs with x+y<=z are the ones with s from min_sum to z (if z>=min_sum) and if z<min_sum, then 0.\n\nBut note: our z starts from C, and min_sum = A+B. Since A<=B<=C, we have A+B <= B+B <= 2*B, and C>=B, so A+B <= 2*B <= C+B (since C>=B) but wait, we don't know the relation between A+B and C. Actually, A+B might be less than C? \n\nExample: A=1, B=2, C=3 -> min_sum=3, and z starts at 3. Then for z=3, we subtract the pairs with s<=3.\n\nBut note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, so when z=3, we require x+y>=4.\n\nBut the pairs (x,y) are: x in [1,2], y in [2,3]. \n   (1,2): 3 -> not counted (since 3<=3)\n   (1,3): 4 -> counted\n   (2,2): 4 -> counted\n   (2,3): 5 -> counted\n\nTotal pairs: 4, pairs with s<=3: 1 (only (1,2)), so the count is 4-1=3.\n\nBut wait, the example input \"1 2 2 5\" gives output 3. In the example, the sides are (1,2,2), (2,2,2), (2,2,3). But note: the condition is A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D, so for the example \"1 2 2 5\": \n   x in [1,2], y in [2,2] (because B=2, C=2), z in [2,5]. But wait, the input is \"1 2 2 5\", so A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nThen the pairs (x,y) are: \n   x from 1 to 2, y from 2 to 2.\n   So two pairs: (1,2) and (2,2).\n\nThen for each pair, we count the z in [2,5] such that z < x+y.\n\nFor (1,2): x+y=3 -> z from 2 to min(5,2) [wait, no: z must be at least 2 and less than 3, so z=2. Then (1,2,2) is valid.\nFor (2,2): x+y=4 -> z from 2 to 5, but condition z<4, so z=2,3. Then (2,2,2) and (2,2,3) are valid.\n\nTotal 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nBut note: the example input \"1 2 2 5\" is provided and output is 3.\n\nBut in our alternative method: we can fix z from 2 to 5 and for each z, count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z.\n\nFor z=2: pairs (x,y) with x+y>2. Both pairs (1,2) and (2,2) satisfy. So count=2.\nFor z=3: pairs (x,y) with x+y>3. Only (2,2) satisfies (since 2+2=4>3). So count=1.\nFor z=4: pairs (x,y) with x+y>4. None, because (1,2)=3<=4 and (2,2)=4<=4 -> no.\nFor z=5: same, none.\n\nThen total triangles = 2+1+0+0 = 3.\n\nBut wait, in the above we are counting the same triangle multiple times? Actually, no: we are counting by fixing z and then counting the pairs (x,y) that form a triangle with that z. Each triple (x,y,z) is uniquely determined by (x,y) and z.\n\nBut note: the condition is that the sides are (x,y,z) with x<=y<=z. In our counting, we fixed x,y and then z must be at least C (which is 2) and at most D (which is 5) and also z must be less than x+y. \n\nBut in the alternative method we fixed z and then counted the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z. This is correct because for each triple (x,y,z) we have one z and one (x,y). \n\nHowever, note that in the problem statement, the sides are labeled as (x,y,z) with the constraints A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So the side x is the smallest, then y, then z. But the triangle condition must hold for all three, but because x<=y<=z, the condition reduces to x+y>z.\n\nBut in our counting by fixing z, we are including all (x,y) that satisfy x+y>z, but note that in the problem, we also require that x<=y and y<=z. However, note that our (x,y) are chosen from [A,B] and [B,C] respectively, so by definition x<=B<=y (so x<=y) and y<=C<=z (so y<=z). Therefore, the condition x<=y<=z is automatically satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\nStep 1: Precompute an array F for s from min_sum to max_sum (min_sum = A+B, max_sum = B+C) such that F[s] = number of pairs (x,y) with x+y=s, x in [A,B], y in [B,C].\n\nStep 2: Build a prefix sum array P for s from min_sum to max_sum (and beyond, but beyond max_sum we don't care) so that P[s] = F[0]+F[1]+...+F[s] (but we only need from min_sum to max_sum). But note: we are going to query for z from C to D, and we need the sum of F[s] for s from min_sum to min(max_sum, z).\n\nBut note: if z < min_sum, then the condition x+y<=z has 0 pairs, so the number of pairs satisfying x+y>z is total_pairs. But our z starts from C, and min_sum = A+B. Since A<=B<=C, we have A+B <= B+B <= 2*B. But C can be as low as B, so if B is small, min_sum might be less than C. However, we know that x+y>=A+B, and z>=C, so if C > max_sum, then for all z>=C, the condition x+y<=z is the entire set (because x+y<=B+C < C <=z, so actually no: wait, if C>B+C? No, because C>=B, so B+C >= C+C? Not necessarily. Actually, the maximum x+y is B+C, and if z >= B+C, then x+y<=z for all pairs, so the condition x+y>z fails for all pairs. \n\nBut note: we are counting the pairs (x,y) for a fixed z by the condition x+y>z. \n\nAlternatively, we can compute:\n\n   total_triangles = 0\n   for z in range(C, D+1):\n        # Condition: x+y>z\n        # The pairs (x,y) that do NOT satisfy x+y>z are those with x+y<=z.\n        # But note: if z < min_sum, then all pairs satisfy, so we don't subtract anything.\n        # But our z starts from C, and min_sum = A+B. Since A<=B<=C, then A+B <= B+B <= 2*B. But C>=B, so we have to check: is A+B <= C? It might be.\n\n        # Actually, we can use the precomputed F and the prefix sum to get the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z.\n\n        # However, we must consider that our F array is defined only for s from min_sum to max_sum, and for s outside that, F[s]=0.\n\n        # Let S = min(max_sum, z)   [because for s>max_sum, F[s]=0]\n        # Then the number of pairs with x+y<=z is the sum_{s=min_sum}^{min(max_sum, z)} F[s]\n\n        # Then the number of pairs with x+y>z is: total_pairs - (that sum)\n\n        # But note: if z < min_sum, then the sum is 0, so the pairs are all total_pairs.\n\n        # But in our case, z starts from C, and min_sum = A+B. We need to consider two cases:\n        #   Case 1: z < min_sum -> then we use the entire set of pairs (all pairs) because no pair has x+y<=z (since the smallest x+y is min_sum, which is greater than z).\n        #   Case 2: z >= min_sum and z <= max_sum -> then we subtract the prefix sum up to z.\n        #   Case 3: z > max_sum -> then we subtract the entire set (prefix sum up to max_sum).\n\n        # Alternatively, we can define the prefix sum for all s from 0 to max_sum (or even to a limit, say MAX_S = max_sum) and then for z from C to D:\n\n        #   if z < min_sum:\n        #       count_pairs = total_pairs\n        #   else:\n        #       if z > max_sum:\n        #           count_pairs = 0\n        #       else:\n        #           count_pairs = total_pairs - prefix[z]\n\n        # But wait: the condition is x+y>z, so we subtract the pairs with x+y<=z. But note: the pairs with x+y<=z are the ones with s from min_sum to min(max_sum, z). So:\n\n        #   Let Q(z) = (number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z) = \n        #        if z < min_sum: 0\n        #        elif z >= min_sum and z <= max_sum: prefix[z] (where prefix[z] = sum_{s=min_sum}^{z} F[s])\n        #        else (z>max_sum): prefix[max_sum]\n\n        # Then the count for z is: total_pairs - Q(z)\n\n        # Then we add that to total_triangles.\n\nBut note: we are counting the same triple (x,y,z) for each z. But that is correct because we are iterating over z.\n\nHowever, wait: the triple (x,y,z) is uniquely determined by (x,y) and z. But in the problem, the triple (x,y,z) must have x<=y<=z. Our counting by fixing z and then (x,y) that satisfy x+y>z and x<=y<=z (by the input constraints) is correct.\n\nBut note: the input constraints already enforce x<=y<=z (because x<=B<=y and y<=C<=z). So we don't have to worry about ordering.\n\nBut note: the example \"1 2 2 5\": \n   total_pairs = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) = (2-1+1)*(2-2+1)=2*1=2.\n\n   Then for z=2: \n        min_sum = 1+2=3, so z=2<3 -> then count_pairs = total_pairs = 2.\n   Then for z=3:\n        min_sum=3, max_sum=4 (B=2, C=2 -> max_sum=2+2=4). \n        z=3: so Q(3) = prefix[3] = F[3] (since min_sum=3, and for s=3: F[3] = number of pairs (x,y) with x+y=3, x in [1,2], y in [2,2]: \n            x+y=3: x=1, y=2 -> valid.

So F[4]=1) -> 2.\n        Then count_pairs = 2-2=0.\n   Then for z=5: \n        z=5>max_sum=4, so Q(5)=prefix[4]=2, count_pairs=0.\n\n   Total_triangles = 2 (for z=2) + 1 (for z=3) + 0 + 0 = 3.\n\nThis matches.\n\nBut note: the example \"1 2 3 4\": \n   Input: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n   total_pairs = (2-1+1)*(3-2+1)=2*2=4.\n\n   min_sum = 1+2=3, max_sum=2+3=5.\n\n   Build F for s from 3 to 5.\n\n   s=3: x+y=3 -> x in [1,2], y in [2,3]: \n        x=1, y=2 -> valid. x=1,y=3 -> 4; x=2,y=2->4; x=2,y=3->5.

However, the example lists: (1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4). \n\nBut note: the triple (1,3,3): x=1,y=3,z=3 -> valid? 1+3>3 -> 4>3 yes. \n        (2,2,3): 2+2>3 -> 4>3 yes.\n        (2,3,3): 2+3>3 -> 5>3 yes.\n        (2,3,4): 2+3>4 -> 5>4 yes.\n\nSo 4 triangles.\n\nBut in our counting by z:\n\n   z=3: \n        pairs (x,y) with x+y>3: \n            (1,3): 4 -> valid (z=3: then (1,3,3))\n            (2,2): 4 -> valid (z=3: (2,2,3))\n            (2,3): 5 -> valid (z=3: (2,3,3))\n        So 3 pairs for z=3.\n\n   z=4:\n        pairs (x,y) with x+y>4: \n            (2,3): 5 -> valid (z=4: (2,3,4))\n        So 1 pair for z=4.\n\n   Total 4.\n\nBut wait, why did we get 3 for z=3 and 1 for z=4? That matches.\n\nBut note: the example input \"1 2 3 4\" is the first example and the expected output is 4.\n\nSo the method is:\n\n   Step 1: Read A,B,C,D.\n\n   Step 2: Let min_sum = A+B, max_sum = B+C.\n\n   Step 3: Precompute F for s from min_sum to max_sum (inclusive) such that:\n        F[s] = number of x in [A, B] such that y = s-x is in [B, C] and x<=B, y<=C.\n\n        Actually, we can compute F[s] as:\n            x_min = max(A, s-C)\n            x_max = min(B, s-B)\n            if x_min <= x_max:\n                F[s] = x_max - x_min + 1\n            else:\n                F[s] = 0\n\n   Step 4: Build an array for s from min_sum to max_sum (we'll index from min_sum to max_sum). Then build a prefix sum array P for s from min_sum to max_sum (so that P[i] = F[min_sum] + F[min_sum+1] + ... + F[i] for i from min_sum to max_sum).\n\n   Step 5: total_pairs = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)\n\n   Step 6: total_triangles = 0\n        for z from C to D:\n            if z < min_sum:\n                count_z = total_pairs   # because all pairs (x,y) satisfy x+y>z (since x+y>=min_sum > z)\n            elif z >= min_sum and z <= max_sum:\n                # The number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z is P[z] (but note: our prefix array P is built for indices from min_sum to max_sum, and we assume that for s < min_sum, F[s]=0, and for s>max_sum, F[s]=0. But we built P only from min_sum to max_sum. We can extend the prefix array to cover [0, max_sum] by setting P[i] = 0 for i < min_sum, and then from min_sum to max_sum.\n\n                # Actually, we should build the prefix array for all s from 0 to max_sum (or at least from min_sum to max_sum) and then for z from C to D, we can use:\n\n                #   if z < min_sum: use 0\n                #   elif z <= max_sum: use P[z] (which is the sum from min_sum to z, but wait: our F array is defined from min_sum to max_sum, and we set F[s]=0 for s<min_sum. Then we can build a prefix array from 0 to max_sum.\n\n                # Alternatively, we can define an array F_full of length (max_sum+1) (indexed 0..max_sum) such that F_full[s] = F[s] if s>=min_sum and s<=max_sum, else 0. Then build a prefix sum for F_full from 0 to max_sum.\n\n                # Then the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z is the sum_{s=0}^{z} F_full[s]. But note: we only care about s from min_sum to z (if z>=min_sum) and if z<min_sum, then 0.\n\n                # But note: our F was defined for s from min_sum to max_sum, and we set zeros elsewhere. Then we can build a prefix array for the entire range [0, max_sum] (with zeros for indices below min_sum and above max_sum? Actually, we only need up to max_sum, and our z goes from C to D (which is <=500000, and max_sum=B+C<=1000000). But we don't need beyond max_sum.\n\n                # We'll build an array F_arr of length (max_sum+1) (index 0..max_sum) with zeros, then for s from min_sum to max_sum, set F_arr[s] = F[s] (as computed above).\n\n                # Then build prefix[z] = F_arr[0]+F_arr[1]+...+F_arr[z] (for z from 0 to max_sum).\n\n                # Then the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z is prefix[z] (if z<=max_sum) and if z>max_sum, then it's prefix[max_sum].\n\n            else: # z > max_sum\n                count_z = 0   # because all pairs (x,y) have x+y<=max_sum < z, so none satisfies x+y>z.\n\n            Then add count_z to total_triangles.\n\n   But wait: the above condition for z>=min_sum and z<=max_sum: the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y<=z is prefix[z] (the prefix sum up to z). Then the pairs (x,y) with x+y>z is total_pairs - prefix[z].\n\n   However, note: the pairs (x,y) are independent of z, and the total_pairs is the total number of (x,y) pairs. But the condition for the triple is that the same (x,y) must be used with the z. And we are iterating z.\n\n   But note: the same (x,y) can be used with multiple z. However, in our counting, for each z we are counting the (x,y) that satisfy x+y>z. Then we are adding these counts for each z.\n\n   Example: (x,y)=(2,2) with z from 2 to 5 in the second example: \n        For z=2: (2,2) is included (because 2+2>2) -> count for z=2: 1.\n        For z=3: (2,2) is included (because 2+2>3) -> count for z=3: 1.\n        For z=4: (2,2) is not included (because 2+2<=4) -> count 0.\n\n   Then the same (x,y) is used for two different z's.\n\n   This is correct: the triple (x,y,z) is (2,2,2) and (2,2,3). So two different triangles.\n\n   So the method is correct.\n\n   However, note: we must build the prefix array for the entire range [0, max_sum] (which is up to 1000000) and then we iterate z from C to D (which is up to 500000) and for each z we do a constant-time lookup.\n\n   But note: the memory for an array of 1000000 integers is about 4 MB, which is acceptable.\n\n   Steps in code:\n\n   Let MAX_S = max_sum (which is B+C, at most 1000000)\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Read A, B, C, D.\n\n   2. min_sum = A+B\n      max_sum = B+C\n\n   3. total_pairs = (B-A+1)*(C-B+1)\n\n   4. Create an array F_arr of zeros with length (max_sum+1) [indices 0 to max_sum]\n\n   5. For s from min_sum to max_sum:\n        x_low = max(A, s-C)\n        x_high = min(B, s-B)\n        if x_low <= x_high:\n            F_arr[s] = x_high - x_low + 1\n        else:\n            F_arr[s] = 0\n\n   6. Build prefix array for F_arr from 0 to max_sum:\n        prefix[0] = F_arr[0]\n        for i from 1 to max_sum:\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + F_arr[i]\n\n        But note: our F_arr is defined for s from 0 to max_sum, and we set zeros for s<min_sum and s>max_sum? Actually, we only set the values from min_sum to max_sum, and the rest are zeros.\n\n        However, we built F_arr for indices 0 to max_sum, and we set all to zero initially, then set the ones from min_sum to max_sum.\n\n   7.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The key insight here is recognizing that for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the constraints \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the most restrictive condition simplifies to \\(x + y > z\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), and \\(x + y > z\\). Directly iterating over all possible values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) would be computationally infeasible for large ranges (up to \\(5 \\times 10^5\\)).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: Instead of checking each triple, we can fix \\(z\\) and count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y > z\\). This transforms the problem into efficiently calculating, for each \\(z\\) in \\([C, D]\\), the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs.\n\n3. **Mathematical Optimization**: For each \\(z\\), the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs is the total number of pairs minus those pairs where \\(x + y \\leq z\\). To compute this efficiently, we:\n   - Precompute the frequency array \\(F\\) where \\(F[s]\\) counts the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y = s\\).\n   - Build a prefix sum array from \\(F\\) to quickly compute the number of pairs with \\(x + y \\leq z\\) for any \\(z\\).\n\n4. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Frequency Array Construction**: For each possible sum \\(s\\) (from \\(A+B\\) to \\(B+C\\)), count the valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs.\n   - **Prefix Sum Array**: This allows us to compute the cumulative count of pairs up to any sum \\(z\\) in constant time.\n   - **Iterate Over \\(z\\)**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), use the prefix sum to determine the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs and accumulate the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    min_sum = A + B\n    max_sum = B + C\n    \n    total_pairs = (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1)\n    \n    if total_pairs == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    F_arr = [0] * (max_sum + 1)\n    \n    for s in range(min_sum, max_sum + 1):\n        x_low = max(A, s - C)\n        x_high = min(B, s - B)\n        if x_low <= x_high:\n            F_arr[s] = x_high - x_low + 1\n        else:\n            F_arr[s] = 0\n            \n    prefix_arr = [0] * (max_sum + 1)\n    if min_sum == 0:\n        prefix_arr[0] = F_arr[0]\n    else:\n        prefix_arr[0] = 0\n        \n    for i in range(1, max_sum + 1):\n        prefix_arr[i] = prefix_arr[i-1] + F_arr[i]\n        \n    total_triangles = 0\n    for z_val in range(C, D + 1):\n        if z_val < min_sum:\n            count_z = total_pairs\n        elif z_val <= max_sum:\n            count_z = total_pairs - prefix_arr[z_val]\n        else:\n            count_z = 0\n        total_triangles += count_z\n        \n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n2. **Initial Checks**: If there are no possible pairs \\((x, y)\\) (i.e., when \\(B < A\\) or \\(C < B\\)), the result is immediately 0.\n\n3. **Frequency Array Construction**: The array `F_arr` is built where each entry `F_arr[s]` holds the count of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y = s\\). This is done by checking the valid range of \\(x\\) for each sum \\(s\\).\n\n4. **Prefix Sum Array**: The `prefix_arr` is constructed to store cumulative counts of pairs up to each sum \\(s\\), enabling efficient range queries.\n\n5. **Counting Valid Triples**: For each \\(z\\) from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\), the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs is derived by subtracting the count of pairs with \\(x + y \\leq z\\) (obtained via the prefix array) from the total number of pairs. The results are summed up to get the final count of non-degenerate triangles.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem using mathematical insights and prefix sums, avoiding the need for brute-force checks and ensuring optimal performance even for large input ranges.",
