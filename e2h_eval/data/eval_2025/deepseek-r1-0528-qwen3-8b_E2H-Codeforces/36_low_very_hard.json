The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (from 1 to 200000). There are n+2 towns (0 to n+1) and we build a tower in each town i (from 1 to n) independently with probability 1/2.\n\n Conditions:\n  - Towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal.\n  - Each town from 1 to n must get signal from exactly one radio tower.\n\n How the signal works: A tower at town i with power p covers all towns c such that |c-i| < p.\n\n Observation:\n\n Since we can choose the signal powers arbitrarily (each from 1 to n), we have freedom. However, the constraints require that:\n\n  For town 0: no tower's signal reaches it. \n      Note: The closest tower is at town 1 (if built). If a tower at town 1 has power p, then it reaches [1-p+1, 1+p-1] -> [2-p, p] (if p>=1). To avoid covering 0, we require that 1-p+1 > 0? Actually, the condition for town 0 is |0-i| >= p. \n      For a tower at town i: |0-i| = i, so we require i >= p. But note: if a tower is built at town i, then we can set its power p to be at most i (so that it doesn't reach 0). However, we also have to cover the adjacent towns appropriately.\n\n  Similarly, for town n+1: the closest tower is at town n (if built). We require that the tower at town n (if built) does not reach n+1, so we must set its power to at most n (which is the distance from n to n+1 is 1, so actually we need p <= n? Actually, the condition for n+1 is |n+1 - i| >= p. For a tower at i, |n+1-i| = n+1-i. So to avoid covering n+1, we require that for every tower at i, n+1-i >= p. But note: we are free to choose p for each tower. However, we also have to cover the intermediate towns.\n\n But note: the main constraint is that each town j (from 1 to n) must be covered by exactly one tower.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Condition 1: Towers must not cover town 0 and town n+1.\n   - For town 0: We must have that no tower i (built or not) can cover it. But note: if a tower is built at i, we can set its power to at most i (because |0-i| = i, so we set p <= i). However, we don't necessarily have to set it to at most i? Actually, if we set a tower at i to a power p > i, then it would cover town 0 (since |0-i| = i < p). Therefore, if a tower is built at i, we must set p <= i. Similarly, for the other side, for a tower at i, to not cover n+1, we must set p <= n+1 - i.\n\n Condition 2: Each town j (from 1 to n) must be covered by exactly one tower.\n\n How do we assign signals?\n\n Consider that the towers are built only in some of the towns 1..n. We are free to assign any integer power from 1 to n to each built tower, but with the constraints that:\n   - For a tower at i: the power p must satisfy p <= i and p <= n+1-i (so that it doesn't cover 0 and n+1 respectively).\n\n However, note: we don't require that the power must be set to the minimum possible. We can set higher powers as long as they don't exceed the minimum of i and n+1-i (to avoid covering 0 and n+1). But wait, there is more: the condition for covering the intermediate towns.\n\n Actually, the problem is about assigning powers so that the coverage of the entire set of towns 1..n is exactly partitioned by the towers.\n\n Another observation: the entire setup is symmetric. The towns are on a line from 0 to n+1.\n\n In fact, we can think of the problem as: we have a set S of built towers (each chosen independently with probability 1/2). Then we wish to assign to each tower i in S a power p_i (an integer between 1 and min(i, n+1-i)) such that for each town j (from 1 to n):\n\n   - There is exactly one tower i (in S) such that |j-i| < p_i.\n\n Moreover, note that the power p_i must be at least enough to cover j? Actually, we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in some towns (each town independently with probability 1/2), we can set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 are not covered by any tower, and each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower. The solution involves combinatorial mathematics and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a given set of built towers, we must be able to assign signal powers such that:\n   - Each tower's power is at most its distance to town 0 and town n+1 (to avoid covering them).\n   - Each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower.\n   \n2. **Insight**: The problem reduces to counting the number of valid subsets of towns where the towers can be placed such that the coverage conditions are met. The solution involves dynamic programming and combinatorial sums over intervals of towns.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We use DP to count the number of valid configurations. The DP state `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to cover towns up to position `i`.\n   - **Combinatorial Mathematics**: The solution involves summing over all possible intervals and using precomputed binomial coefficients for efficient computation.\n   - **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, we compute everything modulo 998244353.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time with O(n) space complexity, which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 2 × 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1, end='')\n        return\n\n    inv2 = pow(2, MOD-2, MOD)\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 2):\n        left = max(0, i - n)\n        right = i\n        L = left\n        R = right\n        \n        if L >= 1:\n            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[L-1]) % MOD\n        \n        k = i - L\n        if k <= 0:\n            pass\n        else:\n            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[L-1] * pow(2, k-1, MOD)) % MOD\n            if L >= 1:\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] - dp[L-1] * pow(2, k-1, MOD)) % MOD\n\n    ans = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i + 1 < n + 1:\n            low = i + 1\n            high = n + 1\n            seg_length = high - low + 1\n            ways = pow(2, seg_length, MOD)\n            ans = (ans + dp[i] * ways) % MOD\n\n    total_subsets = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    ans = ans * pow(total_subsets, MOD-2, MOD) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input value `n` and handles the special case where `n = 1` separately.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` as the base case.\n3. **DP Array Population**: For each position `i`, the code calculates the valid configurations by considering the left and right bounds of the town coverage. It uses combinatorial sums and modular exponentiation to update the DP array efficiently.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is computed by summing over all valid configurations and adjusting for the total number of subsets (each tower is built with probability 1/2). The final result is printed modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the valid configurations using dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics, ensuring optimal performance for large values of `n`.",
