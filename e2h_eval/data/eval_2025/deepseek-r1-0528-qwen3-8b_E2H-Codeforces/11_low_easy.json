A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line of input with 8 positive integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np\n Steps:\n 1. Each bottle has 'l' milliliters. Total drink = k * l.\n 2. Each lime is cut into 'd' slices. So total lime slices = c * d.\n 3. We have 'p' grams of salt.\n\n For one toast:\n   - Each friend needs: nl milliliters (so for all friends: n * nl? Actually note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" and they all drink the same amount. However, the toasts are made for the entire group? Let's read the problem again.\n\n But note: The problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\n And they want to make as many toasts as they can so that each friend drinks the same amount.\n\n However, the sample: \n   Input: \"3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\"\n   Explanation: \n      Drink: 4*5=20 ml -> enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (since each toast for one friend requires 3 ml? Actually wait: each toast for one friend requires nl=3 ml? Then how many toasts for the whole group? \n\n But note: the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for a toast. So if there are n friends, then one toast requires n * nl milliliters? Or does one toast require nl milliliters per friend, meaning that for one toast we need nl * n milliliters?\n\n Actually, let's read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink\" for a toast. So if a friend makes one toast, they need nl ml. But if there are n friends and they are making t toasts in total (each friend making t toasts?), then the total drink needed is t * n * nl? \n\n However, the sample explanation says: \"it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". Here they divided the total drink by 3 (nl). This suggests that the drink requirement per toast is nl (for one friend) but wait, there are n friends. \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for a toast. So if we are making T toasts, then each friend will have T toasts? But then each friend needs T * nl milliliters. And the total drink is k*l. Therefore, the maximum T such that T * n * nl <= k * l.\n\n Similarly, for lime: each toast requires one slice per friend? Or one slice per toast? The problem says: \"a slice of lime\" for each toast. Since each friend needs one slice per toast they are having, then for T toasts and n friends, we need T * n slices? But wait, the example: \n   Lime: 10 limes * 8 slices = 80 slices. Then 80 / (n * T) ? \n\n However, note the sample calculation: min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n In the sample, they calculated:\n   Drink: 20 ml -> 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (meaning they considered that one toast requires 3 ml for the entire group? or per friend?).\n\n Let me re-read: \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for a toast. Then for one toast, how much drink is required? It would be n * nl (because n friends each having one toast requires n * nl). But wait, actually: if we are making T toasts, then each friend will have T drinks? And each drink is nl ml. So total drink for T toasts is T * n * nl.\n\n Alternatively, think: one toast is shared by the whole group? No, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters\" for a toast. That means every time a friend toasts, they take nl ml. But if they are making T toasts, then each friend must have T toasts (each toast being a drinking event). So total drink needed is T * n * nl.\n\n But then the drink constraint: T * n * nl <= k * l  => T <= (k * l) / (n * nl)\n\n Similarly, for lime: each toast requires one slice per friend? Then T * n slices. So T <= (c * d) / n.\n\n For salt: each toast requires np grams per friend? Then T * n * np <= p  => T <= p / (n * np)\n\n However, the sample calculation did:\n\n   Drink: 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But according",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the available resources. The key is to calculate the maximum number of toasts possible based on the constraints of drink, lime slices, and salt, then divide by the number of friends to ensure everyone drinks the same amount.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves calculating the maximum number of toasts that can be made considering the available drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a certain amount of drink per friend, one lime slice per friend, and a certain amount of salt per friend.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves three main constraints:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` milliliters per toast).\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Total lime slices available are `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend).\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `n * np` grams (since each of the `n` friends needs `np` grams per toast).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The maximum number of toasts is determined by the minimum value derived from dividing the total available resources by their respective requirements per toast. This minimum value is then divided by the number of friends to ensure each friend makes the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    k = int(data[1])\n    l = int(data[2])\n    c = int(data[3])\n    d = int(data[4])\n    p = int(data[5])\n    nl = int(data[6])\n    np = int(data[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    \n    max_toasts_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl) if n * nl != 0 else 0\n    max_toasts_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n if n != 0 else 0\n    max_toasts_by_salt = p // (n * np) if n * np != 0 else 0\n    \n    max_toasts = min(max_toasts_by_drink, max_toasts_by_lime, max_toasts_by_salt)\n    \n    print(max_toasts)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input consists of eight integers which are read and split into individual variables.\n2. **Resource Calculation**: \n   - **Total Drink**: Calculated as `k * l`.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Calculated as `c * d`.\n3. **Constraint Calculation**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: The maximum toasts based on drink is `total_drink // (n * nl)`, ensuring integer division.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: The maximum toasts based on lime slices is `total_lime_slices // n`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: The maximum toasts based on salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the three constraints gives the maximum number of toasts possible. This value is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all constraints and ensures the solution is both correct and optimal.",
