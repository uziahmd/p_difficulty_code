He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n Conditions:\n 1. The string is built in three steps:\n    - Step 1: A has a string of one or more 'a's.\n    - Step 2: B appends some number (at least one) of 'b's to the end.\n    - Step 3: C appends some number of 'c's (equal to the total number of 'a' OR the total number of 'b' OR both) to the end.\n\n Important constraints:\n   - The entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? Actually, note that step 3 appends 'c's, so if there are no 'c's then it would be impossible? But wait: the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's (so at least one). However, note that the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR to the number of 'b' in the string\". But note: the string at the time C appends does not include the 'c's he is going to append. So:\n\n Let:\n   n_a = number of 'a' in the entire string (which is the same as the number A originally had, because B and C don't add 'a')\n   n_b = number of 'b' in the entire string (which is the number B appended, because A didn't put any and C doesn't add 'b')\n   n_c = number of 'c' in the entire string (which is the number C appended)\n\n But note: when C appends, the string already has the 'a's and the 'b's (from steps 1 and 2). Then C appends n_c which must be either n_a or n_b (or both). However, the total length of the string is n_a + n_b + n_c.\n\n Also, the order must be: \n   All the 'a's must come first, then all the 'b's, then all the 'c's.\n\n Why? Because:\n   - A gives a string of 'a's -> so we have a contiguous block of 'a's at the beginning.\n   - Then B appends 'b's -> so after the 'a's we have 'b's (if any).\n   - Then C appends 'c's -> so after the 'b's we have 'c's (if any).\n\n Therefore, the string must be non-decreasing in the sense: no 'a' after 'b', no 'b' after 'c'.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check the order: the string should only contain a block of 'a's, then a block of 'b's, then a block of 'c's. If there's an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'c', or a 'b' after a 'c', then it's invalid.\n\n 2. Count the frequency of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Let:\n      n_a = count('a')\n      n_b = count('b')\n      n_c = count('c')\n\n 3. Conditions on counts:\n    - There must be at least one 'a' (given by A) and at least one 'b' (appended by B) and at least one 'c' (appended by C). But note: the problem says that the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b' before C's turn, but C appends at least one 'c'. So the final string must have at least one of each.\n\n    However, what if the string doesn't have all three? For example, if there is no 'c'? Then condition fails.\n\n 4. The condition for the counts is that n_c must be either n_a or n_b (or both). But note: the n_a and n_b in the condition for C are the counts from the string BEFORE C appends the 'c's. However, the problem states: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR to the number of 'b' in the string\" â€” meaning the string at the time C appends (which is the original without the c's). \n\n    But note: the string without the c's has:\n        total a's = n_a (unchanged)\n        total b's = n_b (unchanged)\n        and then C appends n_c c's, and then the condition is that n_c (the appended number) must be either n_a or n_b.\n\n    However, in the final string, the counts for a and b remain the same, so the condition is: n_c must be equal to n_a OR n_b.\n\n    But wait: the problem says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by following a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the order of characters in the string and the counts of each character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Character Order**: The string must consist of a contiguous block of 'a's followed by a contiguous block of 'b's and then a contiguous block of 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'c') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Check Character Counts**: The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Additionally, the string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Check if the string is composed of three segments: a's, b's, c's in that order.\n    i = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        i += 1\n        \n    if i != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Order Check**: The code first checks if the string starts with zero or more 'a's, followed by zero or more 'b's, and ends with zero or more 'c's. If any character appears out of this order, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Count Validation**: After verifying the order, the code counts the occurrences of each character. The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If both conditions are satisfied, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it's \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural and numerical constraints required for the string to be valid according to the problem's specifications.",
