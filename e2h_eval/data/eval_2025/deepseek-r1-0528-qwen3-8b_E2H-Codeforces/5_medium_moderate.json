Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two strings `l` and `r` of length n (each string has n characters) and we need to form the maximum number of pairs (each pair uses one left and one right boot) such that:\n - The colors must be compatible: \n        ('?', '*') -> '?' matches any, so if either is '?' then it's compatible.\n        Otherwise, the two letters must be equal.\n\n However, note: the problem says an indefinite color (?) is compatible with any, and two specific colors are compatible only if they are exactly the same.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We want to maximize the number of pairs. Since each boot can be used at most once, we need to assign as many boots as possible.\n\n 2. We have two types of boots: fixed color and question marks.\n\n 3. The idea: \n    - We can try to first match the fixed colors. But note: sometimes using a '?' to match a fixed color might prevent matching other '?' or fixed colors in a way that leads to more pairs? However, the problem says: maximum number.\n\n    But note: the problem does not require to use all boots. We just want the maximum.\n\n 4. We can consider two kinds of pairs:\n    a) Both boots are fixed: then we require l_i == r_j (and both are not '?').\n    b) At least one is a '?': then they are compatible.\n\n 5. However, we cannot use a boot twice.\n\n 6. How to solve?\n\n    We can break down the problem:\n\n    Let's define:\n        Let L = list of left boots, each represented by (color, index)\n        Let R = list of right boots, each represented by (color, index)\n\n    We want to form k pairs. The problem is similar to bipartite matching, but note n can be up to 150000.\n\n    However, note that the compatibility condition is very flexible: \n        - A '?' matches anything.\n\n    This means that we can use a greedy approach:\n\n    Step 1: Count the frequency of each color (excluding '?') on the left and right.\n\n    But wait: also we have the possibility to use '?' as a wildcard.\n\n    Alternate approach:\n\n    We can think of two stages:\n\n    Stage 1: Match fixed boots with fixed boots. Then, we have some remaining boots (both left and right) that are either '?' or unmatched fixed boots.\n\n    However, note: we are allowed to match a fixed boot with a '?' (if the fixed boot is not matched already). Similarly, a '?' can match a fixed boot.\n\n    Actually, the problem is: we can form a pair between a left boot i and a right boot j if:\n        (l[i] == r[j]) or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]!='?') or (l[i]!='?' and r[j]=='?') or (l[i]=='?' and r[j]=='?')\n\n    But note: the condition is symmetric for '?' and fixed. So we can say:\n\n        Condition: \n            if l[i] == '?' or r[j]=='?' or l[i]==r[j]:\n                then compatible.\n\n    However, note: the condition \"l[i]=='?' or r[j]=='?'\" covers the case where at least one is wildcard, and the condition l[i]==r[j] covers the case where both are fixed and equal.\n\n    But wait: if both are fixed and equal, then we don't need the wildcard condition. And if one is fixed and the other is wildcard, then we don't require the fixed ones to be equal.\n\n    However, the above condition is correct.\n\n    But now, how to maximize the pairs?\n\n    We can use a two-step matching:\n\n    Step 1: Match as many fixed boots as possible without using the '?'.\n\n        For each fixed color c (that is not '?'), count the frequency on the left and right.\n\n        Then, for each color c, the maximum pairs we can form between left and right for this color is min(freq_left(c), freq_right(c)).\n\n        However, note: we cannot mix different colors because two boots must have the same color to form a pair (unless one or both is '?'). So we can do:\n\n            total_fixed_matches = 0\n            Let freq_left = dictionary for left without '?' (but we will separate the '?' later)\n            Let freq_right = dictionary for right without '?'\n\n            For each color c in the alphabet (or just the colors that appear in fixed boots) that is not '?':\n                total_fixed_matches += min(freq_left.get(c,0), freq_right.get(c,0))\n\n        But wait: we cannot simply add all fixed matches because the same boot cannot be used twice.\n\n    However, note: the matching of fixed boots is independent per color? Actually, we can match a fixed left boot of color 'a' only with a fixed right boot of color 'a'. So we can do:\n\n        We can create a bipartite graph for fixed boots: but note the fixed boots are independent. The graph is actually a union of complete bipartite graphs for each color (only edges between left and right with the same color). \n\n        The maximum matching for the fixed part is the sum over colors of min(freq_left[c], freq_right[c]). But note: we are allowed to use each boot only once, and the graph is multi-partite (by color). This is correct.\n\n    Step 2: Then we have the remaining boots (which are either '?' or unmatched fixed boots). Now, we can form pairs between any two remaining boots (left and right) because:\n\n        - A left boot that is fixed (unmatched) can be matched with any right boot that is either fixed (unmatched) or '?'.\n        - Similarly, a right boot that is fixed (unmatched) can be matched with any left boot that is either fixed (unmatched) or '?'.\n        - And a left boot that is '?' can be matched with any right boot (whether fixed or '?') that is left.\n        - Similarly, a right boot that is '?' can be matched with any left boot that is left.\n\n    But note: we want the maximum number of pairs. In fact, the maximum pairs we can form from the remaining boots is:\n\n        Let L_remaining = all left boots that were not used in fixed matching (so these are: all the '?' and the unmatched fixed boots).\n        Similarly, R_remaining = all right boots that were not used in fixed matching.\n\n        Then, we can form a complete bipartite graph between L_remaining and R_remaining. The maximum matching in this complete bipartite graph is min(|L_remaining|, |R_remaining|).\n\n    However, wait: is that true? Actually, no. Because the fixed boots that are unmatched can be matched with any remaining boot (including the '?'). But note: the condition is that a fixed boot (say 'a') can only be matched with a boot of color 'a' or a '?'. However, in the remaining set, we have:\n\n        - On the left: some fixed boots (say color 'a', which was not matched) and some '?'.\n        - On the right: some fixed boots (say color 'b', which was not matched) and some '?'.\n\n    Then, we can form a pair between a fixed left boot (color 'a') and a right boot that is either '?' or 'a'. Similarly, a fixed right boot (color 'b') can be matched with a left boot that is either '?' or 'b'.\n\n    But note: the remaining set may contain multiple colors. However, the condition for matching a fixed boot (with a non '?') is that the other boot must be the same color OR a '?'. So we can use the '?' to fill in for any missing color.\n\n    However, the above two-step approach (first match fixed boots, then match the rest arbitrarily) does not necessarily yield the maximum.\n\n    Why? Consider: maybe by leaving out a fixed boot (color 'a') and instead using it to match with a '?' that could have been used to match two other boots, we can get more pairs? Actually, the two-step approach is valid because:\n\n        In the fixed part, we matched as many fixed boots as possible (without using the '?') and then we use the '?' to match the leftovers. But note: the fixed boots that are unmatched can only be matched with boots of the same color or '?'. So if we don't use the fixed boots in the second step, we can only use them if we have a matching right boot of the same color or a '?'. \n\n    However, the second step is not arbitrary: we can form a bipartite graph where every left boot (from the remaining) is connected to every right boot (from the remaining). Why? Because:\n\n        Condition for a pair (l_i, r_j): \n            if l_i is fixed (say 'a') and r_j is fixed (say 'b'): then they can be matched only if a==b OR if one is '?' (but then one of them is not fixed). But note: in the remaining set, we have already removed the fixed boots that were matched. However, we have not removed the fixed boots that were not matched. And we have the '?'.\n\n        Actually, the condition for a remaining left boot (whether fixed or '?') and a remaining right boot (whether fixed or '?') is that they are compatible if:\n            (l_i == r_j) or (l_i=='?' and r_j!='?') is not the whole condition. Actually, the condition is:\n\n            if (l_i != '?' and r_j != '?' and l_i == r_j) OR (l_i == '?' and r_j != '?') OR (l_i != '?' and r_j == '?') OR (l_i == '?' and r_j == '?')\n\n        But note: the condition for a fixed left boot and a fixed right boot is that they must be equal. However, if we have a fixed left boot and a fixed right boot of different colors, then they cannot be matched. But wait: in the remaining set, we have not used the fixed boots arbitrarily. We only removed the fixed boots that were matched by their own color. So the remaining fixed boots are the ones that either don't have a matching fixed boot of the same color (on the opposite side) or they are left because we didn't have enough on the other side.\n\n        However, we can still match two fixed boots (one left and one right) if they are the same color? But wait: we did the fixed matching by color. So if we have a fixed left boot of color 'a' and a fixed right boot of color 'a' that wasn't matched, then we should have matched them in the first step. Therefore, the remaining fixed boots are those that do not have a matching boot of the same color.\n\n        But note: we did a matching by color independently. We matched min(freq_left[c], freq_right[c]) for each color. So the leftover fixed boots are:\n\n            For color c, the leftover left fixed boots are: freq_left[c] - min(freq_left[c], freq_right[c])\n            Similarly, for color c, the leftover right fixed boots are: freq_right[c] - min(freq_left[c], freq_right[c])\n\n        And for a fixed boot of color c (left) to be matched, we would require a right boot of color c (if it's fixed) or a '?' (if the right boot is '?'). But note: we haven't considered the '?' in the fixed matching.\n\n        So the second step: we have a set of left boots (remaining) which includes:\n            - Leftover fixed boots (each with a specific color, say c)\n            - All the '?' (because we did not remove them in the first step)\n\n        Similarly, the right set includes:\n            - Leftover fixed boots (each with a specific color, say d)\n            - All the '?' (because we did not remove them in the first step)\n\n        Now, the condition for a pair (l_i, r_j) is that they are compatible. This is equivalent to:\n\n            if l_i is fixed (color c) then we require that r_j is either '?' or c.\n            if l_i is '?' then we require that r_j is any (so we don't care).\n\n        Similarly for r_j.\n\n        But note: we want to maximize the number of pairs. The maximum matching in the second step is min(|L_remaining|, |R_remaining|) because the bipartite graph is complete? Actually, no: the graph is not complete in the sense that two fixed boots of different colors cannot be matched (unless one is '?'). But note: in the remaining set, we have:\n\n            Left: { fixed boots (each with a color) and '?' }\n            Right: { fixed boots (each with a color) and '?' }\n\n        And the condition for a fixed left boot (color c) to match a fixed right boot (color d) is that c == d. However, we can also use the '?' to match any.\n\n        This is more complex than a complete bipartite graph.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a greedy matching for the entire set (both fixed and '?') by considering:\n\n        We are allowed to use a '?' to match any, and fixed boots can only match the same color or '?'.\n\n    We can use a two-phase algorithm:\n\n    Phase 1: Match as many fixed boots as possible (without using '?') for each color.\n\n    Phase 2: Then, we have a bipartite graph between the remaining left boots and the remaining right boots, but the edges are defined by:\n        - If the left boot is fixed (color c), then it can connect to right boots that are either '?' or c.\n        - If the left boot is '?', then it can connect to all right boots (even fixed ones) that are not yet matched.\n\n        Similarly for the right.\n\n    But note: we want the maximum matching. The total number of pairs is the fixed pairs plus the matching in phase 2.\n\n    However, the problem requires to output the pairs. We need to know which indices are used.\n\n    Considering the constraints (n up to 150000), we cannot run a general bipartite matching (like Hopcroft–Karp or DFS based) because the graph in phase 2 might be dense.\n\n    Alternate Insight:\n\n    We can consider:\n\n        Let X = set of left boots (with indices) and Y = set of right boots (with indices). We want to form pairs.\n\n        We can break the boots into two sets: \n            Fixed left: F_l = { (index, color) for each left boot that is not '?' }\n            Fixed right: F_r = { (index, color) for each right boot that is not '?' }\n\n        Then, the matching in phase 1 is: for each color c, match min(count_F_l(c), count_F_r(c)) pairs.\n\n        Then, we are left with:\n            Left: \n                L1: the fixed left boots that are not matched (for each color c, there are count_F_l(c) - min(count_F_l(c), count_F_r(c)) )\n                L2: all the left boots that are '?' (we don't know how many, let m = count of '?' in left)\n\n            Right:\n                R1: the fixed right boots that are not matched (for each color c, count_F_r(c) - min(count_F_l(c), count_F_r(c)))\n                R2: all the right boots that are '?' (count = p)\n\n        Now, note: the remaining left boots (L1 ∪ L2) and right boots (R1 ∪ R2) can form pairs as long as:\n\n            - A left boot in L1 (fixed color c) can be paired with a right boot in R2 (any '?' in right) OR with a right boot in R1 that has color c.\n            - A left boot in L2 (color '?') can be paired with any right boot (from R1 and R2).\n\n        Similarly, a right boot in R1 (fixed color d) can be paired with a left boot in L2 (any) or L1 with color d.\n\n        Now, we want to maximize the number of pairs. The total available boots is (|L1|+|L2|) and (|R1|+|R2|). The maximum pairs we can form is min(|L1|+|L2|, |R1|+|R2|). But wait: is that always achievable?\n\n        Actually, no. Consider: we have a fixed left boot (color 'a') and no fixed right boot of color 'a' left, but we have a fixed right boot of color 'b' and a '?' on the right. Then the fixed left boot (a) can be matched with the '?' (which is acceptable). Similarly, the fixed right boot (b) can be matched with a '?' (if available) or with a fixed left boot of color b (if available) or with another '?'.\n\n        However, note: the '?' on the right can be used for multiple purposes. But we have a limited number of '?'.\n\n        Let x = min(|L1|+|L2|, |R1|+|R2|). But we must ensure that we don't use the same '?' twice.\n\n        Actually, we can model the problem as:\n\n            We have two sets of left: L1 (fixed) and L2 (wildcard '?')\n            Two sets of right: R1 (fixed) and R2 (wildcard '?')\n\n            The edges:\n                - Each node in L1 (color c) is connected to:\n                    * All nodes in R1 that have color c (because fixed matches fixed)\n                    * All nodes in R2 (because wildcard matches anything)\n                - Each node in L2 is connected to all nodes in R1 and R2.\n\n            Similarly, each node in R1 (color d) is connected to:\n                    * All nodes in L1 that have color d\n                    * All nodes in L2\n                and each node in R2 is connected to all nodes in L1 and L2.\n\n        Now, we want to find a matching that covers as many as possible (min(|L1|+|L2|, |R1|+|R2|)) but note: the graph is very dense.\n\n        However, note: the maximum matching in this bipartite graph is indeed min(|L1|+|L2|, |R1|+|R2|) because:\n\n            We can use the wildcards (L2 and R2) to cover the mismatches. Specifically:\n\n            Let T = min(|L1|+|L2|, |R1|+|R2|)\n\n            We can first use the wildcards (L2 and R2) to match the non-matching fixed boots. But note: the fixed boots (L1 and R1) can also match with the wildcards.\n\n            Actually, the entire graph is a combination of two complete bipartite graphs:\n\n                Graph1: Between L1 and R1, but only edges for the same color (so it's a union of complete bipartite graphs for each color, but note: we already removed the fixed matches from phase1, so the remaining fixed boots in R1 are the ones that are not matched by their color. However, we can still use the same color for matching in phase2? Actually, no: because the fixed boots of the same color were already matched in phase1. So the remaining fixed boots in R1 are of various colors, and similarly for L1.\n\n            But wait: in phase1, we matched the fixed boots by color. So the remaining fixed boots (L1) are the ones that were not matched because there weren't enough fixed boots of the same color on the opposite side. Now, in phase2, we can use the wildcards to match the fixed boots of any color? Yes.\n\n            However, the fixed boots (L1) and (R1) are of specific colors, and we cannot match two fixed boots of different colors (unless one is a wildcard). But note: the fixed boots (L1) are of color c, and they can be matched with a right boot that is either of color c (but we don't have any in R1 because we matched them all) or a wildcard (R2). Similarly, a fixed boot in R1 (color d) can be matched with a left boot of color d (which we don't have) or a wildcard (L2).\n\n            Therefore, the fixed boots (L1 and R1) can only be matched via the wildcards (if available) or if there's a fixed boot of the same color on the opposite side (which we already matched in phase1). \n\n            So the only way to match the remaining fixed boots is to use the wildcards.\n\n            Now, the wildcards (L2 and R2) are also available to match each other. But note: we can use a wildcard left boot to match a fixed right boot, and vice versa.\n\n            The total number of pairs we can form is:\n\n                Let T1 = min(|L1|, |R1|)   [But wait, we cannot match two fixed boots of different colors? Actually, we cannot match a fixed left (color a) with a fixed right (color b) unless a==b, but we don't have any fixed right of color a because we matched them in phase1. So actually, we cannot match fixed boots across different colors. Therefore, the fixed boots (L1 and R1) are not connected to each other by edges? They are only connected to the wildcards.\n\n            Therefore, the bipartite graph for the remaining set is:\n\n                Left nodes: \n                    Type A: fixed boots (L1) with color c_i (each has degree = |R2| + (number of wildcards in R2? Actually, no: the edge from a fixed left boot (c_i) goes to all right boots that are either wildcard or fixed boot of color c_i. But there are no fixed right boots of color c_i left (because we matched them all). So the fixed left boot (c_i) can only be matched to the wildcards in R2.\n\n                Similarly, fixed right boots (R1) can only be matched to the wildcards in L2.\n\n            And the wildcards (L2 and R2) can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n            Then, the problem reduces to:\n\n                We have two sets of fixed boots (L1 and R1) and two sets of wildcards (L2 and R2).\n\n                The fixed boots in L1 can only be matched to R2, and the fixed boots in R1 can only be matched to L2.\n\n                The wildcards (L2 and R2) can be matched together or with the opposite fixed boots.\n\n            Now, what is the maximum matching?\n\n                We can use the wildcards to cover the fixed boots. Specifically:\n\n                Let x = min(|L1|, |R2|)\n                Then, we can match x fixed left boots (from L1) to x wildcards (from R2).\n\n                Similarly, after that, we can use the remaining wildcards to cover the fixed right boots.\n\n                But note: we have |L2| wildcards on the left and |R2| on the right.\n\n                Alternatively, we can think:\n\n                    Total pairs from the wildcards and fixed boots:\n\n                        Let a = number of wildcards used to match fixed left boots (from L1)\n                        Let b = number of wildcards used to match fixed right boots (from R1)\n\n                    Then, the remaining wildcards (|L2| - a) and (|R2| - b) can be matched together: min(|L2|-a, |R2|-b)\n\n                    Total pairs from phase2 = a + b + min(|L2|-a, |R2|-b)\n\n                    And we have the constraint: a <= min(|L1|, |R2|)\n                    and b <= min(|R1|, |L2| - a)   [because we use a wildcards from left, so the available wildcards for right is |L2| - a]\n\n                    But note: we can also choose to use the wildcards arbitrarily. However, the optimal way is to use as many wildcards as needed for the fixed boots, and then the rest can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n                Actually, the maximum pairs we can form is:\n\n                    Let t1 = min(|L1|, |R2|)   // matching fixed left with wildcards right\n                    Let t2 = min(|R1|, |L2| - t1)   // then, from the remaining wildcards on the left, match with fixed right\n\n                    Then, the leftover wildcards: \n                         left_wildcard_remaining = |L2| - t1\n                         right_wildcard_remaining = |R2| - t1   // wait, no: we used t1 wildcards on the right for the fixed left, so the remaining right wildcards is |R2| - t1? But then we use t2 from the left wildcards (which is |L2| - t1) to match fixed right. Actually, we use t1 from the right wildcards and t2 from the left wildcards.\n\n                    Then, the leftover wildcards: \n                         left_wildcard_remaining = |L2| - t1   (but we used t2 from the left wildcards, so actually we used min(t2, |L2| - t1) for fixed right? Actually, we set t2 = min(|R1|, |L2| - t1). Then the remaining wildcards are:\n\n                         left_wildcard_remaining = |L2| - t1 - t2   (but wait: we used t1 from the right and t2 from the left, but note: the matching is independent? Actually, the matching is:\n\n                         Step 1: Use t1 = min(|L1|, |R2|) to match fixed left with wildcard right.\n                         Step 2: Use t2 = min(|R1|, |L2| - t1) to match fixed right with wildcard left (the remaining wildcard left after step1).\n\n                         Then, the remaining wildcards are: \n                             left: |L2| - t1 - t2\n                             right: |R2| - t1\n\n                         Then, we can match the remaining wildcards arbitrarily: min(|L2| - t1 - t2, |R2| - t1)\n\n                    So total pairs in phase2 = t1 + t2 + min(|L2| - t1 - t2, |R2| - t1)\n\n                However, we can also consider: \n\n                    Alternatively, we can use the wildcards to match the fixed boots arbitrarily (without distinguishing left and right). The total pairs from fixed boots and wildcards is:\n\n                    Let U = |L1| + |R1|   [the total fixed boots that are unmatched]\n                    Let W = |L2| + |R2|   [the total wildcards]\n\n                    Then, we can form at most min(U+W, |L1|+|L2|+|R1|+|R2|) pairs? Actually, the entire set of remaining boots is |L1|+|L2|+|R1|+|R2|? Wait, no: we have two separate sets (left and right). The remaining left boots are L1 and L2 (size |L1|+|L2|) and the remaining right boots are R1 and R2 (size |R1|+|R2|). The maximum pairs is min(|L1|+|L2|, |R1|+|R2|).\n\n                But wait: the condition is that the fixed boots (L1) can only be matched to wildcards (R2) and fixed boots (R1) can only be matched to wildcards (L2). However, the wildcards can also match with each other.\n\n                Actually, the maximum matching is:\n\n                    Let x = min(|L1|, |R2|)   [fixed left matched to wildcards right]\n                    Then, the remaining wildcards on the right: |R2| - x\n                    Then, we can use the wildcards on the left (originally |L2|) to match the fixed right: y = min(|R1|, |L2|)\n                    But wait: we used x wildcards from the right, so the left wildcards are still |L2| (because they weren't used in the previous step). Then we can use min(|R1|, |L2|) for matching fixed right with wildcards left.\n\n                    Then, the remaining wildcards: \n                         left: |L2| - y\n                         right: |R2| - x\n\n                    Then, we can match the remaining wildcards arbitrarily: z = min(|L2| - y, |R2| - x)\n\n                    Then, the total pairs in phase2 = x + y + z.\n\n                But note: we are not forced to use the fixed boots first. However, the above steps are valid.\n\n                But is that the maximum? \n\n                    Total pairs = x + y + z.\n\n                Also, note: we must have x+y+z <= min(|L1|+|L2|, |R1|+|R2|) because:\n\n                    |L1|+|L2| = |L1| + |L2|\n                    |R1|+|R2| = |R1| + |R2|\n\n                    The total pairs we form is x + y + z, and we use:\n\n                        x from L1 (so L1 used x, then the rest |L1|-x is not used)\n                        y from R1 (so R1 used y, then the rest |R1|-y is not used)\n                        and we use x+y from the wildcards (x from R2 and y from L2) and then z from the remaining wildcards.\n\n                    The total left boots used: x + y + z_left_part (actually, the left boots used are: x (from L1) and y+z (from L2: because we use y from L2 for R1, and z from L2 for R2) -> but wait, no: the left boots are:\n\n                        L1: x (used) and |L1|-x (unused)\n                        L2: y (used for R1) and z (used for R2) and |L2| - y - z (unused)\n\n                    Similarly, the right boots used:\n\n                        R1: y (used) and |R1|-y (unused)\n                        R2: x (used) and z (used) and |R2| - x - z (unused)\n\n                    Then, the total pairs is x+y+z.\n\n                However, we can also consider: \n\n                    We can use the wildcards to match the fixed boots arbitrarily, and then the rest of the wildcards match each other.\n\n                This two-step (first use wildcards to match fixed boots) might not be optimal? But note: the fixed boots can only be matched via wildcards (since we don't have matching fixed boots). So we must use wildcards to match the fixed boots.\n\n                But wait: what if we use a wildcard to match a wildcard? That doesn't help the fixed boots. So we must use as many wildcards as necessary to match the fixed boots.\n\n                However, we can also decide: maybe we leave some fixed boots unmatched if we can use a wildcard to match two boots (one fixed and one wildcard) and then use the other wildcard to match another fixed boot? Actually, the matching is one-to-one.\n\n                The above procedure:\n\n                    x = min(|L1|, |R2|)   [use wildcards right to match fixed left]\n                    y = min(|R1|, |L2|)   [use wildcards left to match fixed right]   (Note: we didn't subtract x from |L2| here? Actually, we should: because we have |L2| wildcards on the left, and we are going to use some of them for fixed right. But we are not using the same wildcards twice.)\n\n                Actually, we have two separate sets: L2 and R2. The matching is:\n\n                    Step 1: Match fixed left (L1) with wildcards right (R2). We can use at most min(|L1|, |R2|) from L1 and R2.\n\n                    Step 2: Then, the remaining wildcards on the right: |R2| - x, but we don't use them for fixed left anymore (they are already used). Then, for fixed right (R1), we can use wildcards from the left (L2). But note: the wildcards on the left (L2) are still available (we didn't use any in step1). So we can use min(|R1|, |L2|) from R1 and L2.\n\n                    Then, step3: The remaining wildcards (both sides) can be matched arbitrarily: min(|L2| - y, |R2| - x)\n\n                Then, total pairs = x + y + min(|L2| - y, |R2| - x)\n\n                Now, is that the maximum? \n\n                Example: \n                    L1: [a] (size=1), R1: [b] (size=1)\n                    L2: [w1, w2] (size=2), R2: [w3, w4] (size=2)\n\n                Step1: x = min(1,2)=1 -> use w3 to match a.\n                Step2: y = min(1,2)=1 -> use w1 to match b.\n                Step3: min(2-1, 2-1)=1 -> match w2 and w4.\n\n                Total pairs = 1+1+1 = 3.\n\n                Without the two-step, we have 4 boots: 2 left and 2 right, so maximum 2 pairs? But wait, we have:\n\n                    Left: [a, w1, w2] (3)\n                    Right: [b, w3, w4] (3)\n\n                So maximum pairs is 3.\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    Step1: match a and w3.\n                    Step2: match b and w1.\n                    Step3: match w2 and w4.\n\n                So the above procedure gives 3.\n\n                But what if we change the order?\n\n                    Step1: match a and w3.\n                    Step2: match b and w4 (from R2) -> then y = min(1, 2) but wait, in step2 we are using L2 (wildcards left) for R1 (fixed right). But we have two wildcards on the left. Then step3: min(2-1, 2-1)=1.\n\n                Same result.\n\n                Now, what if we use a wildcard to match two different things? We cannot: each boot only once.\n\n                Therefore, the total pairs in phase2 is x + y + z, where:\n\n                    x = min(|L1|, |R2|)\n                    y = min(|R1|, |L2|)\n                    z = min(|L2| - y, |R2| - x)\n\n                Then, the overall answer is: fixed_pairs (from phase1) + x + y + z.\n\n                However, wait: is that correct? \n\n                Let me check with the example:\n\n                    Input: \n                        n=1\n                        l = \"a\"\n                        r = \"b\"\n\n                    Then, phase1: fixed matching: \n                        color 'a' in left: count=1, in right: count=0 -> min=0\n                        color 'b' in left: count=0, in right: count=1 -> min=0\n                        So fixed_pairs=0.\n\n                    Then, L1: left fixed: ['a'] -> |L1|=1, R1: right fixed: ['b'] -> |R1|=1\n                    L2: left '?' -> 0, R2: right '?' -> 0\n                    Then, x = min(1,0)=0, y=min(1,0)=0, z=min(0,0)=0 -> total pairs=0.\n\n                Another example:\n\n                    n=2\n                    l = \"a?\"\n                    r = \"?b\"\n\n                    Phase1: \n                        fixed: \n                            left: 'a' -> count=1, right: 'b' -> count=1 -> no fixed color 'a' or 'b' on both sides? \n                            Actually, we look for each color (excluding '?'):\n\n                                For 'a': left has 1, right has 0 -> min=0\n                                For 'b': left has 0, right has 1 -> min=0\n\n                    Then, \n                        L1 = [0] (if we index from0: the left boot0 is 'a', which is fixed) -> |L1|=1\n                        R1 = [1] (the right boot1 is 'b') -> |R1|=1\n                        L2 = [1] (the left boot1 is '?') -> |L2|=1\n                        R2 = [0] (the right boot0 is '?') -> |R2|=1\n\n                    Then, x = min(|L1|=1, |R2|=1) = 1\n                    y = min(|R1|=1, |L2|=1) = 1\n                    z = min(|L2| - y = 0, |R2| - x = 0) = 0\n\n                    Total pairs in phase2 = 2, and overall = 0 (from phase1) + 2 = 2.\n\n                    But the entire set has 2 left and 2 right, so maximum pairs is 2.\n\n                    The pairs: \n                        Phase2 step1: match left0 ('a') with right0 ('?') -> valid.\n                        Phase2 step2: match left1 ('?') with right1 ('b') -> valid.\n\n                    So the pairs are (0,0) and (1,1). But wait, the indices: the input uses 1-indexed.\n\n                    However, note: the input example uses 1-indexed indices. Our code should output the indices (from 1 to n) for the left and right boots.\n\n                    The left boot0 is the first boot, so index=1, and right boot",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility is defined such that two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same, while an indefinite color ('?') is compatible with any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires matching left and right boots based on their colors. The key observation is that '?' can match any color, making it a wildcard. The challenge is to maximize the number of pairs by efficiently utilizing these wildcards along with fixed color matches.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves two main phases:\n   - **Phase 1**: Match as many fixed color boots (non '?') as possible. For each color, the number of pairs is the minimum of its occurrences in left and right boots.\n   - **Phase 2**: Handle the remaining boots (both fixed and '?'). Here, fixed boots can only be matched with '?' or the same color (but since same color matches were already considered, they must use '?'), and '?' can match any remaining boot. The goal is to maximize the use of wildcards to form additional pairs.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Phase 1** uses frequency counts of each color to determine the maximum fixed color matches.\n   - **Phase 2** calculates the maximum pairs from remaining boots by first using wildcards to match fixed boots and then pairing leftover wildcards.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each boot once during frequency counting and then performs linear operations on the counts. The overall complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 150000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    l_str = data[1].strip()\n    r_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    left_fixed = []\n    left_wild = []\n    right_fixed = []\n    right_wild = []\n    \n    for i, (lc, rc) in enumerate(zip(l_str, r_str)):\n        if lc != '?':\n            left_fixed.append((i+1, lc))\n        else:\n            left_wild.append(i+1)\n            \n        if rc != '?':\n            right_fixed.append((i+1, rc))\n        else:\n            right_wild.append(i+1)\n            \n    freq_left = defaultdict(int)\n    for _, color in left_fixed:\n        freq_left[color] += 1\n        \n    freq_right = defaultdict(int)\n    for _, color in right_fixed:\n        freq_right[color] += 1\n        \n    fixed_pairs = 0\n    used_fixed_left = defaultdict(int)\n    used_fixed_right = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    for color in set(left_fixed) | set(right_fixed):\n        if color == '?':\n            continue\n        count_left = freq_left.get(color, 0)\n        count_right = freq_right.get(color, 0)\n        m = min(count_left, count_right)\n        fixed_pairs += m\n        \n    total_pairs = fixed_pairs\n        \n    L1_count = len(left_fixed) -
