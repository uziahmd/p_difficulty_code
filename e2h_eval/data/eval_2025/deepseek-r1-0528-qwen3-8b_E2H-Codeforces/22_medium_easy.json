After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines each with a string of m digits (each digit from '1' to '9')\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input.\n 2. We have a grid of n rows and m columns (each row is a string of m characters).\n\n For each subject (column), we want to know the maximum mark and which students achieved that maximum.\n\n However, note: a student is successful if there exists at least one subject in which he is the best (i.e., has the highest mark in that subject, and note: if multiple students have the same highest mark, then they are all considered best in that subject? Actually, the problem says: \"Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject.\" So if multiple have the same highest, then none has a higher one, so all with the max mark are best in that subject.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the best must be unique. So if two students have the same highest mark, then both are best in that subject.\n\n Then, for each student, we need to check if there is at least one subject where his mark is equal to the maximum mark of that subject.\n\n Approach:\n - First, for each column j, find the maximum value (as integer or character) and the set of rows (students) that have that maximum.\n\n However, note: the input is given as strings of digits, but we can compare by their integer value or by the character? Since '1' to '9', we can compare as characters because the ASCII order is the same as numerical for these.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n Let marks = list of n strings, each of length m.\n\n For each j in range(m):\n   col_j = [marks[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n   max_mark = max(col_j)   # This will be a char, but we can use it as is since the digits are in increasing order.\n\n Then, for each student i, we want to check for any subject j: \n   marks[i][j] == max_mark_per_subject[j]\n\n But note: we don't need to store the entire set of best students per subject? We can precompute for each subject the maximum and then for each student, check if in any subject the student's mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n\n However, wait: what if the same student is best in multiple subjects? That's okay, we only need one subject to be best for him.\n\n Alternative plan:\n\n Step 1: Read n and m, then the next n lines.\n\n Step 2: Precompute for each subject j (0-indexed) the maximum mark and the condition for each student.\n\n But note: we don't actually need to know the set of best students, just whether a student has at least one subject where he is best.\n\n We can do:\n\n Let success = [False] * n   # initially no student is successful\n\n For each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n   Let max_char = max( marks[i][j] for i in range(n) )\n   Then, for each student i:\n        if marks[i][j] == max_char and not success[i]:\n            success[i] = True\n\n However, wait: if a student gets the max in multiple subjects, we mark him as soon as we see one. And if we set success[i] to True, then we don't care about the rest. But note: if we break out or continue? Actually, we can break the inner loop for that student once we set it to True, but the above doesn't break the inner loop. But we can break the inner loop for that student if we set it to True.\n\n But the problem: the same subject j might be processed multiple times for the same student? Actually, no: we are iterating j from 0 to m-1, and for each j, we set success[i] to True for every student i that has the maximum in j and hasn't been marked yet.\n\n However, if we mark a student in one subject, then in a later subject we don't need to mark him again. But we can avoid checking the same student again in the same subject? Actually, we are checking the same student in the same subject only once (because we are iterating j). The issue is that we are updating the success[i] multiple times (if the student is best in multiple subjects) but that's okay because once set to True, we don't change it.\n\n But the above code for a fixed j: we set success[i] to True for every student i that has the max in j (even if already True). We can optimize by breaking early for a student if we set it to True, but we don't have to because the inner loop runs for all i anyway.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n For each subject j, compute max_mark = max(column j)\n Then, for each student i, if marks[i][j] == max_mark, then set success[i] = True.\n\n Then, after processing all subjects, count the number of True in success.\n\n This is simpler and we don't need to break early.\n\n Example with the first sample:\n\n Input: \n   3 3\n   223\n   232\n   112\n\n Represented as:\n   marks = ['223', '232', '112']\n\n For subject0 (j=0): column = ['2','2','1'] -> max_mark = '2'\n   Check: \n     student0: '2' == '2' -> True\n     student1: '2' == '2' -> True\n     student2: '1' != '2' -> False\n\n For subject1 (j=1): column = ['2','3','1'] -> max_mark = '3'\n   Check:\n     student0: '2' != '3' -> False\n     student1: '3' == '3' -> True (so now student1 is True)\n     student2: '1' != '3' -> False\n\n For subject2 (j=2): column = ['3','2','2'] -> max_mark = '3'\n   Check:\n     student0: '3' == '3' -> True (so student0 is True)\n     student1: '2' != '3' -> False\n     student2: '2' != '3' -> False\n\n Then, we have two students (0 and 1) are successful.\n\n But wait: the example output is 2.\n\n However, note: the example says:\n   student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3 -> wait, let me index from 1: \n      In the example, the rows are:\n        Row1: 223\n        Row2: 232\n        Row3: 112\n\n   They are numbered from 1. So row0 is student1, row1 is student2, row2 is student3.\n\n   So student1 (row0) is successful (True) and student2 (row1) is successful (True) and student3 (row2) is not.\n\n   Therefore, we have 2 successful students.\n\n   Our method gives two students (index0 and index1) which correspond to student1 and student2.\n\n   But wait: the example output is 2, so that matches.\n\n   However, note: the example input representation: the first line is \"3 3\", then three strings.\n\n   Now, let's check the second sample:\n\n   Input: \n        3 5\n        91728\n        11828\n        11111\n\n   We expect 3.\n\n   Let me break down:\n\n   n=3, m=5.\n\n   marks = [\n        \"91728\",\n        \"11828\",\n        \"11111\"\n   ]\n\n   For each subject j (0 to 4):\n\n   j0: column = ['9','1','1'] -> max='9'\n        student0: '9'=='9' -> True\n        student1: '1'!='9' -> False\n        student2: '1'!='9' -> False\n\n   j1: column = ['1','1','1'] -> max='1'\n        all three students: True (but student0 already True, so set student1 and student2 to True)\n\n   j2: column = ['7','8','1'] -> max='8'\n        student0: '7' != '8'\n        student1: '8' == '8' -> True (student1 was already True from j1, but we set again, but doesn't matter)\n        student2: '1' != '8'\n\n   j3: column = ['2','2','1'] -> max='2'\n        student0: '2'=='2' -> True (already True)\n        student1: '2'=='2' -> True (already True)\n        student2: '1' != '2'\n\n   j4: column = ['8','8','1'] -> max='8'\n        student0: '8'=='8' -> True (already True)\n        student1: '8'=='8' -> True (already True)\n        student2: '1' != '8'\n\n   So all three students are marked as True. Count=3.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, code:\n\n   Steps:\n     Read the first line to get n and m.\n     Then read the next n lines.\n\n     Initialize a list `success` of booleans of length n, all set to False.\n\n     For j in range(m):\n        column = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            column.append(marks[i][j])\n\n        max_char = max(column)\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            if marks[i][j] == max_char:\n                success[i] = True\n\n     Then, count = sum(success)\n\n     Print count.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the input is given as a string without spaces. We are reading n and m first.\n\n But note: the example input is given as a list of strings in the example, but in the problem, the input is from standard input.\n\n Example input format:\n\n     Input: \n          3 3\n          223\n          232\n          112\n\n     Or sometimes in the example: \n          ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', ...] \n\n     But we are reading from stdin.\n\n     We can do:\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if not data: then n and m are not provided.\n\n     Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        first_line = input().split()\n        n = int(first_line[0])\n        m = int(first_line[1])\n\n        marks = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            s = input().strip()\n            marks.append(s)\n\n     But note: the input might have multiple lines, and we are reading until n lines.\n\n     However, the problem says: first line contains n and m, then n lines.\n\n     Let's code accordingly.\n\n     But wait: the example input is given as a single string in the example, but that's just an example representation.\n\n     We'll assume standard input.\n\n     Code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if not data:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        first_line = data[0].split()\n        n = int(first_line[0])\n        m = int(first_line[1])\n\n        marks = []\n        for i in range(1, 1+n):\n            # Each line is a string of m characters, no spaces\n            s = data[i].strip()\n            marks.append(s)\n\n        # Then proceed as above.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        marks = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n     But note: the problem says the first line has two integers, then n lines.\n\n     Let me use:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        marks = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            marks.append(input().strip())\n\n     However, the problem states: \"Next n lines each containing m characters\"\n\n     This should work.\n\n     But wait: what if there are extra spaces? The problem says: \"Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9\", and the marks are not separated by spaces.\n\n     So we can safely use strip().\n\n     Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n     Edge cases: n=0 or m=0.\n\n     According to constraints: n, m ≥ 1, so no need to handle 0.\n\n     Code:\n\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        marks = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        success = [False] * n\n\n        for j in range(m):\n            # Build the j-th column\n            col = [marks[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n            max_mark = max(col)\n            for i in range(n):\n                if marks[i][j] == max_mark:\n                    success[i] = True\n\n        count = sum(success)\n        print(count)\n\n Let me test with the first sample:\n\n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        marks = ['223','232','112']\n\n        j=0: col = ['2','2','1'] -> max_mark='2'\n            i0: '2'=='2' -> True -> success[0]=True\n            i1: '2'=='2' -> True -> success[1]=True\n            i2: '1'=='2' -> False\n\n        j=1: col = ['2','3','1'] -> max_mark='3'\n            i0: '2'=='3' -> False\n            i1: '3'=='3' -> True -> success[1] becomes True (already True, so no change)\n            i2: '1'=='3' -> False\n\n        j=2: col = ['3','2','2'] -> max_mark='3'\n            i0: '3'=='3' -> True -> success[0] becomes True (already True)\n            i1: '2'=='3' -> False\n            i2: '2'=='3' -> False\n\n        Then count = number of True: 2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n     Let me test with the second sample:\n\n        Input: \n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        marks = ['91728','11828','11111']\n\n        j0: col=['9','1','1'] -> max='9'\n            i0: True, i1:False, i2:False -> success=[True,False,False]\n\n        j1: col=['1','1','1'] -> max='1'\n            i0: True -> success[0] remains True; i1: True -> success[1]=True; i2: True -> success[2]=True -> now [True,True,True]\n\n        Then the rest of the columns won't change.\n\n        Count=3.\n\n     This is correct.\n\n     But note: the example input representation in the problem statement is given as a list of strings in quotes, but we are reading from stdin.\n\n     We'll submit this.\n\n     However, note: the input might have leading/trailing spaces? The problem says: \"Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9\" and the marks are not separated by spaces. So we can use strip() to remove any accidental spaces.\n\n     This solution is O(n*m) which is acceptable since n,m <= 100 (so 100*100=10000 operations).\n\n     Let me run the code with the provided examples.\n\n     Example 1: \n        Input: \n            3 3\n            223\n            232\n            112\n\n        Output: 2\n\n     Example 2:\n        Input:\n            3 5\n            91728\n            11828\n            11111\n\n        Output: 3\n\n     So we are good.\n\n     Write the code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m) from the first line of input. Then, read the next n lines, each representing a student's marks across m subjects.\n2. **Tracking Successful Students**: For each subject, identify the highest mark achieved by any student. Then, for each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, mark them as successful.\n3. **Counting Successful Students**: After processing all subjects, count how many students have been marked as successful.\n\nThe key insight here is that a student needs only one subject where they have the highest mark to be considered successful. The solution efficiently checks each subject's maximum mark and updates the success status of each student accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    marks = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        s = data[i].strip()\n        marks.append(s)\n        \n    success = [False] * n\n    \n    for j in range(m):\n        col = [marks[i][j] for i in range(n)]\n        max_mark = max(col)\n        for i in range(n):\n            if marks[i][j] == max_mark:\n                success[i] = True\n                \n    count = sum(success)\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input data line by line. The first line contains two integers, n (number of students) and m (number of subjects). The subsequent lines contain the marks for each student.\n2. **Initialization**: A boolean list `success` is initialized to keep track of which students are successful. All entries start as `False`.\n3. **Processing Subjects**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined. Then, every student who achieved this highest mark in the subject is marked as successful (`True`).\n4. **Result Calculation**: The total number of successful students is counted by summing up the `True` values in the `success` list and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects and determines their success status with optimal time complexity, O(n*m), which is feasible given the constraints (n and m are at most 100).",
