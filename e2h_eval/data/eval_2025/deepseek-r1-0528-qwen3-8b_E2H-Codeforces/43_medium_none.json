He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "\n Okay, let's break down the problem:\n\n Conditions:\n 1. The string is built in three steps:\n    - Step 1: A has a string of one or more 'a's.\n    - Step 2: B appends some number (at least one) of 'b's to the end.\n    - Step 3: C appends some number of 'c's (equal to the total number of 'a' OR the total number of 'b' OR both) to the end.\n\n Important constraints:\n   - The entire string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'? Actually, note that C appends 'c' but the condition says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR to the number of 'b' in the string\". However, note that after step 3, the string has the original 'a's and 'b's and then the appended 'c's.\n\n But wait: the problem states that initially A gives a string with at least one 'a' and one 'b' (because B appends 'b' and then the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'). Then C appends 'c's. So the final string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"aabc\" -> Output: \"YES\"\n\n Steps for \"aabc\":\n   Count: \n     a: 2, b: 1, c: 1\n   Condition: number of 'c' should be either the number of 'a' (which is 2) or the number of 'b' (which is 1). Here it is 1, which equals the number of 'b'. Also, the order is correct: the string is \"aa\", then \"b\", then \"c\".\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the exact counts of the original a's and b's, only that the first part is all 'a's (so contiguous), then all 'b's (contiguous), then all 'c's (contiguous). \n\n Therefore, we can deduce the following:\n\n 1. The string must be divided into three contiguous segments: [a's] [b's] [c's]. Because:\n      - A appends only 'a's at the beginning, then B appends only 'b's, then C appends only 'c's.\n\n 2. There must be at least one 'a', at least one 'b', and at least one 'c'.\n\n 3. Let:\n        n_a = count of 'a'\n        n_b = count of 'b'\n        n_c = count of 'c'\n\n 4. The condition for the number of 'c's: n_c must be either n_a or n_b (or both).\n\n However, note: when C appends the 'c's, the total number of 'a's and 'b's are fixed (from the original string from A and B). So the condition is on the entire string? Actually, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR to the number of 'b' in the string\". \n\n But note: the string at the time C appends the 'c's is the one from A and B. So the number of 'a' and 'b' that C sees is the same as in the final string? Actually, no: because when C appends, the string already has the 'a's and 'b's. Then the condition is on the state before appending the 'c's. However, the problem says \"in the string\", meaning the entire string at that moment? Or the one that C is given?\n\n Let me read: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' OR to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\n The word \"in the string\" likely refers to the current string (the one from A and B) at the time C receives it. So the condition is based on the counts of 'a' and 'b' from the first two steps.\n\n However, note: the entire string after C's appending will have the same number of 'a' and 'b' as the string before C's appending, because C only appends 'c'. Therefore, the condition for the number of 'c's is: \n        n_c_appended = either n_a (from the entire string after C's appending, but wait: the entire string after C's appending has the same n_a as the original, because the original didn't change) OR n_b (same reason).\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends\" must be equal to the number of 'a' (in the string that C received, i.e., the original string without 'c') OR to the number of 'b' (again, in that original string).\n\n But note: the original string (without the appended 'c's) has the same number of 'a' and 'b' as the entire string (because the 'c's are appended and don't change the existing 'a' and 'b').\n\n So condition: the total number of 'c' in the final string must be equal to the original n_a (which is the same as the final n_a) OR the original n_b (which is the same as the final n_b).\n\n Therefore, condition: n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b.\n\n However, wait: what if there are no 'b's in the original string? But the problem states that B appends some number of 'b's (at least one). Similarly, A appends at least one 'a'. So the original string (without 'c') has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then the final string has the same n_a and n_b, plus n_c (which is either n_a or n_b).\n\n But note: the entire string must be in the form: a's (at least one), then b's (at least one), then c's (at least one). \n\n Therefore, we must check:\n\n 1. The string is non-decreasing in the sense: no 'a' after 'b' or 'c', and no 'b' after 'c'. So we can split the string by 'b' and 'c' to see the pattern.\n\n Steps:\n\n   - Check that the string is composed of three contiguous parts: one or more 'a's, then one or more 'b's, then one or more 'c's.\n\n   How to check the contiguous segments?\n        We can traverse and check that we don't see an 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', and similarly for 'b' after a 'c'.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n        if the string does not contain the letter 'c' in the prefix until the last 'a' and 'b', and the 'c's are at the end.\n\n   Example: \n        \"aabc\" -> valid: ['aa','b','c'] -> but note: actually the string is \"aa\", then \"b\", then \"c\". \n\n   However, what if the string is \"aaccc\"? Then we have two a's, then no b's? That violates the condition because B must append at least one 'b'. So the string must have at least one 'b'.\n\n   Therefore, we require:\n\n        The string must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n\n   And the arrangement must be: \n        All 'a's (if any) must be at the beginning, then all 'b's (if any) then all 'c's (if any).\n\n   But note: the problem says that A gives a string of 'a's (so only 'a'), then B appends 'b's (so the string becomes a's followed by b's). Then C appends 'c's. Therefore, the entire string must be in non-decreasing order (each character is less than or equal to the next) but with the constraint that the characters are only 'a','b','c' and they appear in increasing order.\n\n   So we can check:\n\n        s[0] must be 'a' (unless the string is empty, but |S|>=1)\n        Then, we can traverse and ensure that we never see an 'a' again after a non-'a', and similarly for 'b' after a non-'b'.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        - If the string contains a letter that is not the smallest so far, then we require that we haven't seen a higher letter and then a lower one.\n\n   Since the allowed letters are only 'a','b','c', we can check:\n\n        For i in range(1, len(s)):\n            if s[i] < s[i-1]: \n                then invalid.\n\n        But note: the string must be non-decreasing. However, the condition of the problem requires that the string is built by appending only 'b's and then only 'c's. So the string should be non-decreasing.\n\n   Example: \"aabc\" -> \n        a <= a <= b <= c -> valid.\n\n   But consider: \"abac\" -> this would have an 'a' after a 'c'? Actually, we don't have to worry about that because the condition is that the entire string is built in three contiguous blocks.\n\n   However, the condition of contiguous blocks is stronger: we cannot have any 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', and similarly for 'b' after a 'c'. \n\n   We can check:\n\n        Let i = 0\n        while i < len(s) and s[i]=='a': i++\n        Then from i to end, while s[i]=='b': i++\n        Then from i to end, while s[i]=='c': i++\n\n        If we reach the end and i==len(s), then the string is in the form of a's then b's then c's.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Let n = len(s)\n\n        # Check for at least one of each\n        if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s or 'c' not in s:\n            return \"NO\"\n\n        # Now check the contiguous segments\n        i = 0\n        # Count the consecutive 'a's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n\n        # Now we should have passed the 'a's and reached a 'b' or 'c'\n        j = i\n        while j < n and s[j]=='b':\n            j += 1\n\n        k = j\n        while k < n and s[k]=='c':\n            k += 1\n\n        if k != n:\n            return \"NO\"\n\n        # Now we have the counts: \n        n_a = i   # because we counted i times 'a'\n        n_b = j - i   # from index i to j-1\n        n_c = n - j   # from index j to n-1\n\n        # Condition for the number of 'c's: n_c (the appended ones) must be equal to either n_a (the total a's) or n_b (the total b's) OR the condition is on the original string (which has the same n_a and n_b as the entire string) but note: the problem says the number of 'c' appended is equal to the number of 'a' OR 'b' in the string that C received (which is the same as the entire string's a and b). So the condition is: \n        # The number of 'c' appended is n_c, and that must be equal to the number of 'a' (n_a) OR the number of 'b' (n_b) in the entire string (which is the same as the original string) because the 'c' are appended at the end.\n\n        # But wait: the condition says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends\", so we are comparing n_c (the actual appended length) with the original counts (n_a and n_b). However, note: the entire string's a and b are the same as the original. So we compare n_c with n_a and n_b.\n\n        if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, wait: the example \"aabc\": \n        s = \"aabc\"\n        n_a = 2, n_b = 1, n_c = 1 -> condition: 1==2 or 1==1 -> true -> YES.\n\n   Example \"aaabccc\": \n        s = \"aaabccc\"\n        n_a = 3, n_b = 1, n_c = 3 -> condition: 3==3 or 3==1 -> true -> YES.\n\n   Example \"bbacc\": \n        This example is given as \"NO\". Why? \n        Let's check: \n            Does it have at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c'? -> yes.\n            Check the contiguous segments: \n                Start: first char is 'b' -> so the while loop for 'a' does nothing -> n_a=0 -> but we require at least one 'a'. Actually, our code above checks for the presence of 'a','b','c' first, but then we also check the contiguous segments.\n\n        In \"bbacc\":\n            First char is 'b', so we skip the 'a' segment. Then we look for 'b's: we take two 'b's. Then we look for 'c's: we find one 'c'. Then we have two more 'a's? Actually, the string is \"bbacc\": \n                The contiguous segments: \n                    We start at index0: 'b' -> so we break the a-segment (we found 0 a's). Then we break the b-segment at the first non-'b'? Actually, we are only looking for 'b's until we hit a non-'b'. Then we look for 'c's. But then we have an 'a' after the 'c'? \n\n        Actually, the code above for the contiguous segments would break at the first non-'b' (which is 'a' in \"bbacc\" at index2). Then we try to parse the rest as 'c's? But we have an 'a' in the middle.\n\n        So our code would set:\n            i = 0 (since no 'a' at the beginning) -> then j starts at 0 and counts two 'b's (so j becomes 2). Then we look for 'c's from index2: the next two characters are 'a' and 'c'. The while loop for 'c' will break at the first 'a' (because 'a' != 'c'). Then k=2, which is not equal to 5 (the length) -> returns \"NO\".\n\n        This matches the example.\n\n   But wait: what if the string doesn't have the three contiguous segments? Then we return \"NO\".\n\n   However, there is an edge case: what if the string has no 'a'? Then the initial condition fails (we require at least one 'a'). Similarly for 'b' and 'c'.\n\n   But note: the problem states that the process ensures at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from A and B) and then C appends at least one 'c' (because the number of 'c' is either the number of 'a' (at least one) or the number of 'b' (at least one)).\n\n   Therefore, the conditions we check are:\n\n        Condition1: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n        Condition2: The string must be in the form of a contiguous block of 'a's (possibly empty? but we require at least one 'a' so not empty) then a contiguous block of 'b's (at least one) then a contiguous block of 'c's (at least one).\n        Condition3: The number of 'c's (the entire block) must be equal to the number of 'a's (entire block) or the number of 'b's (entire block).\n\n   However, wait: the problem says that the string is built by A (only a's), then B (appends b's), then C (appends c's). So the entire string must have the three segments. And the condition for the c's is on the entire string's a and b (which are fixed). \n\n   But note: the condition for the c's is that the number of c's appended is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's. The entire string's a's and b's are the same as the original because the c's are appended at the end. So the condition is on the entire string's a and b.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        Steps:\n\n        1. Check that the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c'.\n        2. Check that the string is in non-decreasing order (i.e., no character out of order) and the order is a's, then b's, then c's.\n\n        Alternatively, we can check the contiguous segments without relying on the presence of all three first? Actually, we can do the contiguous segment check and then check the counts.\n\n        However, note: the contiguous segment check already implies the presence of the three segments? Not necessarily: we might have a string without a particular letter, but then the contiguous segment check would fail because we would break at the first non-matching segment.\n\n        Example: \"aaa\" -> \n            Condition1: missing 'b' and 'c' -> so we return NO.\n\n        So we can combine:\n\n        Let s = input string.\n\n        Step1: Check the contiguous segments.\n\n        i = 0\n        # Read a's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n        # Read b's\n        j = i\n        while j < n and s[j]=='b':\n            j += 1\n        # Read c's\n        k = j\n        while k < n and s[k]=='c':\n            k += 1\n\n        if k != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Now, we have the counts: \n        n_a = i\n        n_b = j - i\n        n_c = n - j\n\n        # Conditions for the problem: \n        #   At least one 'a', one 'b', one 'c': so n_a>=1, n_b>=1, n_c>=1 (from the problem, because A appends at least one 'a', B at least one 'b', and C appends at least one 'c' (since the number of 'c' is either n_a or n_b, which are at least 1) -> but note: if n_a=0, then we wouldn't have entered the a's loop, so n_a=0 is allowed by the contiguous segment check? Actually, the contiguous segment check would have set i=0, then j=0, then k=0, and then k!=n -> we output NO.\n\n        # However, the problem states that the process ensures at least one 'a' and one 'b' (so n_a>=1, n_b>=1) and then C appends at least one 'c' (so n_c>=1). Therefore, we must have n_a>=1, n_b>=1, n_c>=1.\n\n        if n_a == 0 or n_b == 0 or n_c == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the problem says that the string is built by A (at least one 'a'), then B (at least one 'b'), then C (at least one 'c') because the condition for C's appending is that the number of 'c' is either the number of 'a' (which is at least one) or the number of 'b' (at least one). So the condition n_c>=1 is inherent.\n\n   But wait: what if the condition is met by having zero? Actually, the condition says \"the number of letters 'c' he appends\" is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. If there are zero 'a' or zero 'b', then the condition would require zero 'c'? But the problem states that the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b' (from the first two steps) so n_a>=1 and n_b>=1. Then C appends at least one 'c'? Actually, no: the condition says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. Since the number of 'a' and 'b' are at least one, then the number of 'c' must be at least one? Actually, no: if the number of 'a' is 0, then the condition would say 0, but we don't have that. But note: the problem states that the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So we are safe.\n\n   However, our contiguous segment check and the condition on the counts (n_a>=1, n_b>=1, n_c>=1) are necessary.\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"aabbcc\" (without the condition on the numbers)? \n        n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=2 -> condition: 2==2 or 2==2 -> true -> YES.\n\n   Another example: \"aaabbcc\" -> \n        n_a=3, n_b=2, n_c=2 -> condition: 2==3? no, 2==2? yes -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" -> \n        n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> condition: 3==4? no, 3==3? yes -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" -> \n        n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=4 -> condition: 4==4 or 4==3 -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaaabbbcc\" -> \n        n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=2 -> condition: 2==4? no, 2==3? no -> NO.\n\n   Example: \"abc\" -> \n        n_a=1, n_b=1, n_c=1 -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aabbcc\" -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aabbc\" -> \n        n_a=2, n_b=2, n_c=1 -> condition: 1==2? no, 1==2? no -> NO.\n\n   Example: \"aabbbc\" -> \n        n_a=2, n_b=3, n_c=1 -> NO.\n\n   Example: \"aaabbbccc\" -> YES (as above).\n\n   Example: \"aaabccc\" -> \n        n_a=3, n_b=1, n_c=3 -> YES.\n\n   Example: \"aaabccb\" -> \n        This string: \n            a's: 3, then b's: 1, then c's: 2, then b? -> but our contiguous segment check would fail because after the c's we have a 'b'. So we return NO.\n\n   But note: the problem says the string is built by appending at the end. So the entire string must be a's then b's then c's. Therefore, we must have the contiguous segments.\n\n   However, what if the string is \"ac\"? \n        Contiguous segments: \n            a: then next is 'c' -> so we break at the first non-'a'. Then we look for 'b's: we don't have any. Then we look for 'c's: we have one. But we broke because we didn't have a 'b' segment? Actually, the contiguous segment check:\n\n            i=0: reads the 'a', then j=i=1: tries to read 'b' but s[1] is 'c' -> so j remains 1. Then we read c's: from index1 to end: one 'c'. Then k=2, which is the length -> so we proceed.\n\n            Then we check: n_a=1, n_b=0, n_c=1 -> then we check: n_b==0 -> so we output NO.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: the problem requires at least one 'b' from B. So if the contiguous segment check passes (i.e., we read a's, then b's, then c's) but the b's part is empty, then we must output NO.\n\n   Our code does that because we check n_b>=1.\n\n   However, note: the contiguous segment check does not require that the b's part is non-empty? Actually, in the contiguous segment check, we read the b's until we hit something else. If there are no b's, then j remains i (the start of the b segment) and then we move to c's. Then we read all the remaining as c's. Then we check n_b = j-i = 0, and then we output NO.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        i = 0\n        # Read a's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n\n        j = i\n        # Read b's\n        while j < n and s[j]=='b':\n            j += 1\n\n        k = j\n        # Read c's\n        while k < n and s[k]=='c':\n            k += 1\n\n        if k != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        n_a = i\n        n_b = j - i\n        n_c = n - j\n\n        if n_a == 0 or n_b == 0 or n_c == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, wait: the problem does not require that the string has at least one 'c'? Actually, the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's (and the condition requires that the number of 'c's is either the number of 'a' or the number of 'b', which are at least 1). So the string must have at least one 'c'. Therefore, the condition n_c>=1 is inherent.\n\n   But note: the problem states that C appends some number (so at least one) because the condition is set to the number of 'a' (which is at least one) or the number of 'b' (at least one). Therefore, the condition n_c>=1 is enforced by the requirement.\n\n   However, what if the condition is met by having zero? The problem states that the string is built by the three steps, and the third step appends at least one 'c'. So the entire string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n   Therefore, we can remove the n_c>=1 check if we rely on the condition that the contiguous segment check passes and the condition on the counts (n_c must be equal to n_a or n_b, and n_a>=1, n_b>=1) implies n_c>=1.\n\n   But note: if n_c==0, then the condition fails because we require n_c==n_a (which is>=1) or n_c==n_b (>=1) -> so n_c must be at least 1. Therefore, we can just check:\n\n        if n_a == 0 or n_b == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, we already checked that the contiguous segments cover the entire string, and if there is no 'c', then the contiguous segment check would have set k to j (the end of the b's) and then k != n (if there's leftover) -> so we already output NO. But what if the string ends with b's and there's no c? Then k==j, and if j==n then k==n -> so we don't catch it in the contiguous segment check.\n\n   Actually, the contiguous segment check: \n        We read a's, then b's, then we try to read c's. If there are no c's, then we break immediately and k remains j (which is n). Then we proceed.\n\n   So we must check that n_c>=1. But note: the problem requires at least one 'c' (because C appends at least one). Therefore, we must check that n_c>=1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note: the condition n_c==n_a or n_c==n_b, and since n_a>=1 and n_b>=1, then n_c must be at least 1. So if n_c==0, then the condition fails. But we don't need to check separately for n_c>=1 because the condition will fail anyway.\n\n   However, the problem requires the string to have at least one 'c' (from the process). So if n_c==0, then the string is built without the third step? Actually, the problem says C appends, so the string must have the c's. Therefore, we must have n_c>=1.\n\n   But our contiguous segment check does not require that there are c's. It allows the string to end at the b's. Then we have:\n\n        Example: \"aab\" -> \n            n_a=2, n_b=1, n_c=0 -> condition: 0==2 or 0==1 -> false -> NO.\n\n   And that is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can simplify:\n\n        if n_a == 0 or n_b == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   But wait, what if the contiguous segment check passes and we have no 'c'? Then the condition fails because n_c==0, and that's caught.\n\n   However, the problem says the string must have at least one 'c'. So we are okay.\n\n   But note: the problem statement says: \"B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" So if there are no 'c', then C did not append any? But the condition says the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or 'b'. If the number of 'c' is zero, then unless the number of 'a' or 'b' is zero, it fails. And we already check that n_a and n_b are at least one.\n\n   Therefore, we can write the code as above.\n\n   However, let me test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example1: \"aaabccc\" -> YES (correct)\n        Example2: \"bbacc\" -> NO (correct)\n        Example3: \"aabc\" -> YES (correct)\n\n   One more edge: \n        \"aaaabbbccc\" -> n_a=4, n_b=3, n_c=3 -> YES (correct)\n\n   But wait: what if the string is \"ab\"? \n        This string: \n            a's: 'a' -> n_a=1\n            then b's: 'b' -> n_b=1\n            then c's: none -> n_c=0\n            Condition: n_c==1 or n_c==1 -> false -> NO. Correct because the process requires C to append at least one 'c'.\n\n   Another edge: \"ac\" -> \n        a's: 1, then b's: 0 -> fails (n_b==0) -> NO. Correct.\n\n   Another edge: \"a\" -> NO (n_b==0, n_c==0) -> correct.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the string is built by A (at least one 'a'), then B (at least one 'b'), then C (at least one 'c'). So the minimal string is \"abc\".\n\n   Therefore, we are covering all cases.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the string is given and we must check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way.\n\n   One more corner: \n        What if the string is \"abbccc\"? \n            a's: 'a' -> n_a=1\n            b's: 'bb' -> n_b=2\n            c's: 'ccc' -> n_c=3\n            Condition: 3==1 or 3==2 -> no -> NO.\n\n        But wait: the condition is that the number of 'c' appended is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' (in the string that C received). The string that C received was \"abb\", so the number of 'a' is 1, the number of 'b' is 2. Then C appends 3 'c's. 3 != 1 and 3 != 2 -> so NO.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        i = 0\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n\n        j = i\n        while j < n and s[j]=='b':\n            j += 1\n\n        k = j\n        while k < n and s[k]=='c':\n            k += 1\n\n        if k != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        n_a = i\n        n_b = j - i\n        n_c = n - j\n\n        if n_a == 0 or n_b == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n   However, wait: what if the string is \"aab\"? \n        n_a=2, n_b=1, n_c=0 -> condition: 0==2 or 0==1 -> false -> NO. Correct.\n\n   But note: the problem says that the string must have at least one 'c'. So we are good.\n\n   However, there's one more thing: what if the string has extra letters? \n        Example: \"aabbc\" -> valid, but what if \"aabbcx\"? \n        Our contiguous segment check: \n            We read a's, then b's, then c's, then we hit an 'x'. Then k != n -> NO.\n\n   So the string must not contain any other letters.\n\n   Since the problem says the string consists of 'a','b','c', we don't have to worry about other letters.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'\".\n\n   Therefore, we are safe.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example: \"aaabccc\" -> YES\n        Example: \"bbacc\" -> NO\n        Example: \"aabc\" -> YES\n\n   But wait: the example \"aabc\" has 2 a's, 1 b, 1 c. Condition: 1==2 or 1==1 -> YES.\n\n   However, note: the condition is on the entire string's a and b (which are the same as the original). The original string (before C appends) is \"aab\", so the number of a's is 2, the number of b's is 1. Then C appends 1 'c'. So condition holds.\n\n   One more: \"aaabccc\" -> original string is \"aaab\", so a's=3, b's=1, then C appends 3 'c's. Condition: 3==3 or 3==1 -> YES.\n\n   But wait: the problem says that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string (that C received). In the example \"aaabccc\", the string that C received is \"aaab\", so the number of 'a' is 3, the number of 'b' is 1. Then C appends 3 'c's. So condition is met.\n\n   However, note: the example \"aabc\" has the string that C received as \"aab\", so the number of 'a' is 2 and the number of 'b' is 1. Then C appends 1 'c'. Condition: 1==2 or 1==1 -> YES.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n   But wait: the example \"aabc\" is given as \"YES\", and our code returns \"YES\".\n\n   However, note the example \"bbacc\": \n        The string is \"bbacc\". \n        Our contiguous segment check: \n            Start: first char is 'b' -> so the a's loop doesn't run -> i=0.\n            Then we try to read b's: from index0 to index1 (both 'b') -> j=2.\n            Then we try to read c's: from index2: 'a' -> fails, so k=2, which is not equal to 5 -> output NO.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        i = 0\n        while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n            i += 1\n\n        j = i\n        while j < n and s[j] == 'b':\n            j += 1\n\n        k = j\n        while k < n and s[k] == 'c':\n            k += 1\n\n        if k != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        n_a = i\n        n_b = j - i\n        n_c = n - j\n\n        if n_a == 0 or n_b == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n                print(\"YES\")\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and end with one or more 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the entire string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Contiguous Segments**: The string must be divided into three contiguous segments: 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like an 'a' after a 'b' or 'c') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: After verifying the contiguous segments, count the number of 'a's (n_a), 'b's (n_b), and 'c's (n_c) in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' (as per the problem's requirements). Then, check if the number of 'c's (n_c) is equal to either the number of 'a's (n_a) or the number of 'b's (n_b). If both conditions are met, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\n\ni = 0\nwhile i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n    i += 1\n\nj = i\nwhile j < n and s[j] == 'b':\n    j += 1\n\nk = j\nwhile k < n and s[k] == 'c':\n    k += 1\n\nif k != n:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    n_a = i\n    n_b = j - i\n    n_c = n - j\n\n    if n_a == 0 or n_b == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if n_c == n_a or n_c == n_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Contiguous Segment Check**: The code first checks if the string starts with zero or more 'a's, followed by zero or more 'b's, and ends with zero or more 'c's. If the entire string does not conform to this structure, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n2. **Character Count Validation**: After confirming the contiguous segments, the code calculates the counts of 'a's (n_a), 'b's (n_b), and 'c's (n_c). It ensures there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. \n3. **Final Validation**: The code checks if the number of 'c's (n_c) matches either the number of 'a's (n_a) or the number of 'b's (n_b). If this condition is satisfied, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the string's structure and character counts, ensuring compliance with the problem's specified conditions.",
