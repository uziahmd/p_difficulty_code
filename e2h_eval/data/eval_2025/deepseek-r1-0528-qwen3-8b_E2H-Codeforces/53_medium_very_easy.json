    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We'll consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates.\n 3. However, note: the problem asks for the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n Alternate approach:\n   We can iterate over all possible substring lengths (from the maximum down to 1) and check if there exists any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: The problem says \"longest\", so we can start from the maximum possible substring length (which is n-1, because you need two non-overlapping? Actually, they can overlap. So even two overlapping ones: e.g., \"aaa\" has \"a\" repeated, but also \"aa\" repeated? Actually, in \"ababa\", the substring \"aba\" appears twice (at index0 and index2). However, note that the problem says occurrences can overlap, so we can have overlapping occurrences.\n\n However, note: We are looking for the longest substring that appears at least twice. So we can do:\n\n   Let n = len(s)\n   For length in range(n-1, 0, -1):  # from n-1 down to 1\n        Create a set (or dictionary) of all substrings of this length.\n        If we find at least one substring that appears at least twice, then output the length and break.\n\n   But wait: what if no substring of length L appears twice? Then we try L-1.\n\n However, note: It's possible that the same substring might appear more than twice, but we only care about at least twice.\n\n But the problem: the entire string might be the same letter? Then the substring of length 1 (the letter) will appear many times. But we are going from large to small, so we would first check the largest possible substring (length n-1) and then n-2, etc.\n\n Example: \n   Input \"abcd\": no duplicate substring of length 3 or 2 or 1? \n        length 3: substrings are \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> unique\n        length 2: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> unique\n        length 1: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> unique -> so answer 0.\n\n   Input \"ababa\":\n        length 4: \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate.\n        length 3: \"aba\", \"bab\", \"aba\" -> \"aba\" appears twice -> answer 3.\n\n   Input \"zzz\":\n        length 2: \"zz\", \"zz\" -> two substrings of length2: both \"zz\", so duplicate -> answer 2.\n\n However, note: In \"zzz\", the substring \"zz\" appears twice (overlapping). But the problem says occurrences can overlap.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We can do:\n      n = len(s)\n      for length in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n          seen = {}\n          found = False\n          for i in range(0, n - length + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+length]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  # We found a duplicate, so this length is the answer.\n                  found = True\n                  break\n              else:\n                  seen[substr] = 1\n\n          if found:\n              print(length)\n              exit(0)\n\n      If we don't find any duplicate, then print 0.\n\n But wait: what if we break at the first duplicate we find for a given length? That gives us the longest substring that appears twice, because we are checking from the largest length downward.\n\n However, note: It is possible that a substring of a larger length might appear twice, but we break at the first occurrence. Since we are iterating from large to small, the first duplicate we find is the largest length that satisfies the condition.\n\n But note: we are checking for each length independently. This is correct.\n\n However, we must consider: if we break at the first duplicate we find for a given length, then we don't check the entire set for that length? Actually, we break as soon as we find one duplicate. But that is okay because we just need one substring of that length that appears twice.\n\n But note: the set `seen` is built for the current length. We break when we see a duplicate.\n\n However, there is a catch: we are building the set by iterating from left to right. When we see a duplicate, we break. But it's possible that we see a substring that we've seen before, so we break.\n\n Example \"ababa\": \n   length=3: \n        i=0: substr=\"aba\" -> not seen -> add to set.\n        i=1: substr=\"bab\" -> not seen -> add to set.\n        i=2: substr=\"aba\" -> seen! -> break and return 3.\n\n But what if we don't break and continue? Then we might find a longer duplicate? No, because we are checking from the maximum length downward. So we are sure that if we break, we have found the longest.\n\n However, note: the maximum length we check is n-1, which is the maximum possible for two distinct starting indices (since the substring must appear at least twice, the maximum length is floor((n)/1) but actually the two occurrences must be at least one apart? They can overlap, so the maximum length for two occurrences is n-1? Actually, no: the two occurrences must be at least one character apart? \n\n Actually, consider: \n   For a substring of length L to appear twice, the second occurrence must start at an index i such that i <= n-L. The first occurrence starts at j (with j < i). The two occurrences can overlap arbitrarily.\n\n But note: the maximum length we can have for two occurrences is limited by the entire string. The two occurrences must fit in the string. The maximum length L must satisfy: L <= n - (i - j) [but the second occurrence starts at i and the first at j, and they must be contiguous with the substring]. Actually, the minimal distance between the two starting indices is 0 (overlap) but the substring must be contiguous. The maximum length is n-1 because if we take a substring of length n, there is only one occurrence.\n\n So our loop from n-1 down to 1 is correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty and length<=100. So worst-case, we have 100, then we check lengths from 99 down to 1. For each length, we iterate over (n - length + 1) substrings. The total number of operations is about:\n\n   Sum_{length=1}^{n-1} (n - length + 1) \n\n But we are going from high to low, and we break at the first duplicate we find for a given length.\n\n But worst-case (if no duplicate is found until length 1) then we do:\n\n   For length = n-1: 2 substrings\n   length = n-2: 3 substrings\n   ... \n   length=1: n substrings\n\n Total number of substrings considered: (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = n*(n-1)//2, which for n=100 is about 5000, which is acceptable.\n\n But note: we are storing each substring in a set. The maximum length of a substring is 99, and we are storing up to 100 substrings per length. The total storage is O(n^2) in the worst-case (if we don't break early). However, 100^2 = 10000 characters, which is acceptable.\n\n However, we can optimize by breaking early in the inner loop as soon as we find a duplicate.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a set for each length. But since the maximum length is 100 and the string length is 100, we can do:\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        substrs = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in substrs:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            else:\n                substrs.add(substr)\n\n   Then if we finish the loop without breaking, we continue to the next L.\n\n   If we never break, then after the loops we print 0.\n\n But note: we must break out and output the first (largest) L for which we find a duplicate.\n\n Let me test with the examples:\n\n   Example \"abcd\": \n        L=3: substrs = {\"abc\", \"bcd\"} -> no duplicate -> next L=2: {\"ab\",\"bc\",\"cd\"} -> no duplicate -> L=1: {\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\"} -> no duplicate -> output 0.\n\n   Example \"ababa\":\n        L=4: substrs = {\"abab\", \"baba\"} -> no duplicate -> L=3: \n            i=0: \"aba\" -> add\n            i=1: \"bab\" -> add\n            i=2: \"aba\" -> already in set -> output 3.\n\n   Example \"zzz\":\n        L=2: \n            i=0: \"zz\" -> add\n            i=1: \"zz\" -> already in set -> output 2.\n\n This matches the sample outputs.\n\n However, note: the problem says the string is given as a list of strings? Actually, the example input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'].\n\n But the problem says: the first input line contains the string.\n\n So we read one string from stdin.\n\n Code:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n\n   n = len(s)\n   # If the string is empty, but guaranteed non-empty, so skip.\n\n   # We'll iterate from L = n-1 down to 1.\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        substrs = set()\n        found = False\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in substrs:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            else:\n                substrs.add(substr)\n\n   # If we get here, no duplicate found for any length.\n   print(0)\n\n But wait: what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the first duplicate we see, which is correct.\n\n However, note: we are breaking at the first duplicate we see for a given L. That is sufficient because we only need to know if there is at least one substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: we are using a set. The set doesn't record the frequency, but we break as soon as we see a substring that is already in the set. This is correct because we only need one duplicate.\n\n However, consider: what if we have two different substrings of the same length that are duplicates? We break at the first one we find. But that's okay because we are looking for the longest substring that appears twice. The first one we find for a given length is the one we want.\n\n But wait: we are iterating from the largest length to smallest, so we break at the largest L for which we have a duplicate.\n\n One more edge: if the string has two identical substrings of length L, but the same substring also appears again? Then we break at the first duplicate.\n\n But that's correct.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"at least twice\". We break when we see the second occurrence of the same substring.\n\n But what if we have three occurrences? Then we break at the second occurrence we see. That's correct.\n\n But what if we have two occurrences of two different substrings of the same length? Actually, no: we break at the first duplicate we see. But we are iterating through the string, so we might see:\n\n   Example: s = \"abcabc\"\n\n   We are looking for length 3: \n        substrings: \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", \"abc\"\n\n        i0: \"abc\" -> set = {\"abc\"}\n        i1: \"bca\" -> set = {\"abc\", \"bca\"}\n        i2: \"cab\" -> set = {\"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\"}\n        i3: \"abc\" -> duplicate -> break and output 3.\n\n This is correct.\n\n But wait: the two \"abc\" are at indices 0 and 3. They are not overlapping? Actually, they are separated. But the problem allows overlapping.\n\n However, the example \"abcabc\" has two non-overlapping \"abc\", which is allowed.\n\n Another example: s = \"aabaac\"\n\n   We are looking for length 3: \n        i0: \"aab\"\n        i1: \"aba\"\n        i2: \"baa\"\n        i3: \"aac\"\n\n        None duplicate? Then we try length 2:\n            i0: \"aa\"\n            i1: \"ab\"\n            i2: \"ba\"\n            i3: \"aa\" -> duplicate -> output 2.\n\n But wait, is there a duplicate of length 3? Actually, no. But the substring \"aa\" appears twice (at indices0 and indices3). So the answer is 2.\n\n However, note: the substring \"aa\" is of length 2.\n\n But what about overlapping duplicates for length 2? \n        In \"aabaac\", the substring \"aa\" appears at index0 and index3. There is also an overlapping possibility: \n            index0: \"aa\"\n            index1: \"ab\" -> not \"aa\"\n            index2: \"ba\" -> not \"aa\"\n            index3: \"aa\"\n\n        So we found two non-overlapping ones.\n\n But note: the problem allows overlapping. So we should also consider overlapping occurrences. Our method does consider all consecutive substrings, so if there is an overlapping occurrence, we will see the same substring again.\n\n Example: s = \"aaaa\"\n   We want to find the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n   Consider length 3: \n        \"aaa\" (from index0) and then from index1: \"aaa\" -> duplicate -> output 3.\n\n   But wait, the substring \"aaa\" appears twice (overlapping). So the answer is 3.\n\n   How does our code handle?\n        n = 4\n        L=3: \n            i0: \"aaa\" -> set.add(\"aaa\")\n            i1: \"aaa\" -> already in set -> output 3.\n\n   Correct.\n\n Therefore, the code is:\n\n   s = input().strip()\n   n = len(s)\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen_substrings = set()\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen_substrings:\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)\n            seen_substrings.add(substr)\n   print(0)\n\n However, note: the problem input is given as a list of strings? The example input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'].\n\n But the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n So we read one string.\n\n But wait, the example input is provided as a list? Actually, the problem says:\n\n   Input\n      The first input line contains the string.\n\n   Example Input\n      ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n This is confusing. Actually, the example input format is showing multiple test cases? But the problem says the first input line is the string.\n\n Let me re-read: \n      \"Input\n       The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\"\n\n So we are reading one string.\n\n But the example input is given as a list of three strings. This might be because the problem statement was copied from a multi-test case environment. However, the problem says \"the first input line\", meaning one string per test.\n\n Clarification: the problem is likely to be run with one test case. The example input is provided as a list for illustration of multiple outputs.\n\n Since the problem says the first input line is the string, we read one string.\n\n However, if we are to process multiple test cases, then we would read until EOF. But the problem says the first input line is the string, and then presumably the program ends.\n\n But the example input is given as a list. The problem statement says \"You're given a string\", so I think we are to read one string.\n\n But wait, the example output is given as a list of answers: ['0','3','2'].\n\n How is that? \n\n   Input: \n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   Then output:\n        0\n        3\n        2\n\n Or maybe the example input is provided in one line? \n\n   Example Input: \n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   Then we would read three lines.\n\n However, the problem says \"The first input line contains the string.\" and then the example input is shown as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'].\n\n This is ambiguous.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Output one number\", so for one test case.\n\n And the example input is given as a list of three strings. This suggests that the problem might be intended to be run with multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says \"You're given a string\", singular.\n\n Since the constraints say the string length is at most 100 and non-empty, and there is no mention of multiple test cases, but the example input is given as a list, we must check the actual competition problem.\n\n But the problem says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then describes the input as \"The first input line contains the string\".\n\n So the intended format is one string per run.\n\n However, the sample test 2 is \"ababa\", and the expected output is 3.\n\n But the example input is given as:\n\n      Input\n          ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n      Output\n          ['0', '3', '2']\n\n This implies that the problem might be testing multiple test cases. But the problem description does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"The first input line contains the string.\" and then \"Output one number\".\n\n So if we are to process multiple test cases, then we would read until EOF. However, the problem does not specify that.\n\n But note: the problem statement says \"the string\" (singular) and \"its length doesn't exceed 100\", so one string.\n\n However, the example input is given as a list of three strings. This is confusing.\n\n Since the problem says \"You're given a string\", we assume one string.\n\n But wait, the example output is a list of numbers. \n\n What if the problem expects multiple test cases? \n\n The problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" and then the example input is shown as a list of three strings. \n\n I think there is a misunderstanding. In many problems, the input may contain multiple test cases. The problem statement sometimes says \"t\" for the number of test cases, but here it doesn't.\n\n But the example input is provided as a list. \n\n To clarify: the problem says \"You're given a string\", so we are given one string. However, the example input is written in a way that suggests three test cases.\n\n Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the constraints are small, let's consider:\n\n   Option 1: The problem is for one test case. Then we read one string.\n\n   Option 2: The problem is for multiple test cases, and the input is terminated by EOF.\n\n But the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" (singular) and then the example input is a list.\n\n However, looking at the example output, it is a list of three numbers. \n\n After re-examining: the problem says \"Output one number\", so for one test case. But the example input has three test cases.\n\n I think the example input format is meant to show three separate inputs, each on a new line. So the actual input would be:\n\n     abcd\n     ababa\n     zzz\n\n And then the output would be:\n\n     0\n     3\n     2\n\n But the problem says \"Output one number\", so if we are to process multiple test cases, we must output multiple numbers.\n\n The problem statement does not specify whether there is one test case or multiple.\n\n Since the problem says \"The first input line\", it implies one string per execution. But then how do we explain the example?\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be designed to read until EOF. \n\n Let me check the constraints: the string length is at most 100, but there could be multiple test cases.\n\n Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the example input is provided as a list, I think we should read until EOF.\n\n But the problem says \"The first input line\", so one string. \n\n However, the sample test 2 is \"ababa\", and the expected output is 3.\n\n Another possibility: the problem statement is poorly written and the example input is just illustrating the output for three different strings.\n\n But the problem says: \"Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\"\n\n And the input is one string.\n\n How can we resolve?\n\n   We can ask for clarification, but since we cannot, we must rely on the problem statement.\n\n   The problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So if we are to write a program that reads from stdin, we can read the first line and process that string.\n\n   But if the input has multiple lines, then we are reading the first line and ignoring the rest.\n\n   However, the example input is given as three lines. \n\n   This suggests that the problem might have multiple test cases.\n\n   Since the problem statement does not specify the number of test cases, and the example input has three, we can assume that the input may consist of multiple test cases (each test case being a string) and we process until EOF.\n\n   But the problem says \"the first input line\", so the first line is the string for the first test case.\n\n   However, the example output is three numbers, one per test case.\n\n   Therefore, we must process multiple test cases.\n\n   How to read until EOF? \n\n   We can use:\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                s = input().strip()\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n            # process s and output the answer\n\n   Then for each string, we compute the answer.\n\n   Example: \n        Input:\n            abcd\n            ababa\n            zzz\n\n        Output:\n            0\n            3\n            2\n\n   But the problem says \"Output one number\", but if there are multiple test cases, we output multiple numbers.\n\n   The problem statement does not specify the number of test cases, so we assume there could be multiple.\n\n   However, the original problem statement says \"You're given a string\", singular. But the example input is plural.\n\n   Since the constraints say the string length doesn't exceed 100, and the string is non-empty, we can read multiple test cases.\n\n   But wait, the problem says \"The first input line\", which implies the first line is the first string, and then what? \n\n   Let me check the sample test 2: the sample test 2 is provided as \"ababa\", so if we are to read multiple test cases, then we must read until EOF.\n\n   Since the problem statement does not specify the input format beyond the first line, and the example input is multiple lines, we assume multiple test cases.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Output one number\", but if there are multiple test cases, we output one number per test case.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, we change the code to:\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                s = input().strip()\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n            n = len(s)\n            # Now, for this string, find the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n            found = False\n            # We are going from the largest possible length (n-1) down to 1.\n            for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n                seen = set()\n                for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                    substr = s[i:i+L]\n                    if substr in seen:\n                        print(L)\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                    seen.add(substr)\n                if found:\n                    break\n            if not found:\n                print(0)\n\n   But wait, we can break out of the outer loop as well? Actually, we break the inner loop and then break the outer loop.\n\n   However, we can structure it differently.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                s = input().strip()\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n            n = len(s)\n            ans = 0\n            for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n                seen = set()\n                found_duplicate = False\n                for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                    substr = s[i:i+L]\n                    if substr in seen:\n                        ans = L\n                        found_duplicate = True\n                        break\n                    seen.add(substr)\n                if found_duplicate:\n                    break\n            print(ans)\n\n   But note: if we break in the middle of the L loop, we break the inner loop and then the outer loop. Then we print the last found_duplicate L.\n\n   However, we can also use the previous method.\n\n   But note: we are breaking the inner loop and then the outer loop, then printing.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the flag and use:\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                s = input().strip()\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n            n = len(s)\n            ans = 0\n            for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n                seen = set()\n                for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                    substr = s[i:i+L]\n                    if substr in seen:\n                        ans = L\n                        break\n                    seen.add(substr)\n                else:\n                    # This else corresponds to the for loop finishing normally (without break)\n                    continue\n                break\n            print(ans)\n\n   But this is a bit more complex.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                s = input().strip()\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n            n = len(s)\n            ans = 0\n            for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n                seen = set()\n                duplicate_found = False\n                for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                    substr = s[i:i+L]\n                    if substr in seen:\n                        duplicate_found = True\n                        break\n                    seen.add(substr)\n                if duplicate_found:\n                    ans = L\n                    break\n            print(ans)\n\n   But note: if we break the inner loop, we break the outer loop and set ans to L. Then print ans.\n\n   However, if we don't break the inner loop, then we continue to the next L. Then if we don't break the outer loop, ans remains 0 and we print 0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait, if we break the inner loop, we break the outer loop. Then we print the current L (which is the largest L for which we found a duplicate).\n\n   However, we set ans = L and break the outer loop, then print ans.\n\n   But the above code sets ans = L only if we break the inner loop. Then breaks the outer loop and prints.\n\n   Alternatively, we can simply break the outer loop when we find a duplicate.\n\n   But the above code does that.\n\n   However, the problem says the string length is at most 100, so we can use this.\n\n   But note: the example input is one string per line, and we are reading until EOF.\n\n   Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: s = \"abcd\"\n            n=4, then L from 3 down to 1.\n            L=3: set becomes {\"abc\",\"bcd\"} -> no duplicate -> next L=2: set becomes {\"ab\",\"bc\",\"cd\"} -> no duplicate -> L=1: set becomes {\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\"} -> no duplicate -> ans remains 0 -> output 0.\n\n        Example 2: s = \"ababa\"\n            n=5, L=4: set becomes {\"abab\",\"baba\"} -> no duplicate -> L=3: \n                i0: \"aba\" -> add\n                i1: \"bab\" -> add\n                i2: \"aba\" -> found duplicate -> set ans=3, break outer loop, output 3.\n\n        Example 3: s = \"zzz\"\n            n=3, L=2: \n                i0: \"zz\" -> add\n                i1: \"zz\" -> duplicate -> ans=2, output 2.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But note: the problem statement example input is given as a list of three strings, so we assume we are reading from standard input until EOF.\n\n   However, the problem says \"The first input line\", which might mean one test case. But the example input has three lines.\n\n   Since the problem statement does not specify the number of test cases, and the example input has three, we assume multiple test cases.\n\n   But wait, the problem statement says \"You're given a string\", singular. \n\n   There is ambiguity. But the example input format is three lines. \n\n   In competitive programming, sometimes problems have multiple test cases and sometimes they don't. \n\n   Given the problem statement says \"the string\", but the example input is three strings, we must decide.\n\n   After reading the problem statement again: \"The first input line contains the string.\" \n\n   This implies that the first line is the string. Then what about the rest? \n\n   The problem does not say that there are multiple test cases.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   But then the example input is three lines. \n\n   How is that? \n\n   The example input is:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This might be a representation of three separate runs, each with one string.\n\n   So we should read one string and output one number.\n\n   But the example output is three numbers.\n\n   Now I am confused.\n\n   Let me check the problem statement example: \n\n        Input\n            ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        Output\n            ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   This is likely just showing the outputs for the three inputs.\n\n   In the actual competition, the input is provided as three separate lines (one per test case) or as one string of three test cases? \n\n   The problem says the first input line is the string. \n\n   So if the input file has three lines, then we have three test cases.\n\n   But the problem statement does not specify the input format beyond the first line.\n\n   Since the constraints say the string length doesn't exceed 100, and the string is non-empty, and there is no specification of the number of test cases, we must assume the input may have multiple test cases.\n\n   But the problem says \"The first input line\", so if there are multiple test cases, then the first line is the first string, the second line is the second string, etc.\n\n   Therefore, we should read until EOF.\n\n   Final decision: read until EOF.\n\n   Code:\n\n        while True:\n            s = input().strip()\n            if s == '':\n                # Some systems might provide an empty line? But the string is non-empty.\n                # But if we get an empty line, we break.\n                break\n            n = len(s)\n            ans = 0\n            for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n                seen = set()\n                duplicate_found = False\n                for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                    substr = s[i:i+L]\n                    if substr in seen:\n                        ans = L\n                        duplicate_found = True\n                        break\n                    seen.add(substr)\n                if duplicate_found:\n                    break\n            print(ans)\n\n   However, what if the input is provided with an empty line? The problem says the string is non-empty.\n\n   But the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the first input line contains the string. So if we are reading the first line and it's empty, then it's invalid. But the problem guarantees non-empty.\n\n   But note: the input might end with an empty line? \n\n   We can use:\n\n        try:\n            while True:\n                s = input().strip()\n                if s == '':\n                    # If we get an empty string, then break (but the problem says non-empty, so this might be the last newline?)\n                    # But the problem says the string is non-empty, so we assume we don't get empty.\n                    # However, if we get an empty string, we break.\n                    break\n                # process s\n        except EOFError:\n            pass\n\n   But the problem says the string is non-empty, so we can assume that the input will always have at least one non-empty string until EOF.\n\n   However, the problem says \"The first input line\", so if we are reading the first line and it's empty, then it's an error. But the problem guarantees non-empty.\n\n   We'll assume the input is as described.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list, so we don't know the exact format.\n\n   Since the problem is from a competition, and the example input is three strings, we assume multiple test cases.\n\n   Let me run the code with the example:\n\n        Input:\n            abcd\n            ababa\n            zzz\n\n        Output:\n            0\n            3\n            2\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, if the problem intended only one test case, then we would read one string and output one number. \n\n   But the example input is three lines, so the problem intended multiple test cases.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code for multiple test cases.\n\n   But wait, the problem statement says \"You're given a string\", singular. \n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   After careful thought, I think the problem statement is poorly written. The example input is three separate test cases, but the problem statement says \"the string\", meaning one string.\n\n   How did the example input become three? \n\n   I think the problem statement example is meant to show three separate examples, not one input file with three strings.\n\n   But the problem says \"Input\" and then shows a list. \n\n   In summary, we must follow the example input format.\n\n   Since the example input is provided as a list of three strings, and the expected output is a list of three numbers, we assume the input consists of multiple strings (each on its own line).\n\n   Therefore, we read until EOF.\n\n   Code:\n\n        while True:\n            s = input().strip()\n            if s == '':\n                # If we encounter an empty string, then break (but the problem says non-empty, so this might be the last newline)\n                # But note: the problem says the string is non-empty, so we expect at least one non-empty string per line.\n                # However, if the input ends with a newline, we might get an empty string.\n                # We can break on EOFError too.\n                break\n            n = len(s)\n            # We are going to find the answer for this string.\n            # Start from the maximum possible substring length (n-1) down to 1.\n            found_length = 0\n            for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n                seen = set()\n                duplicate_found = False\n                for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                    substr = s[i:i+L]\n                    if substr in seen:\n                        found_length = L\n                        duplicate_found = True\n                        break\n                    seen.add(substr)\n                if duplicate_found:\n                    break\n            print(found_length)\n\n   But wait, we are using s = input().strip() and then processing. We break when we get an empty string.\n\n   However, the problem says the string is non-empty, so we can also break on EOFError.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        import sys\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        for line in data:\n            s = line.strip()\n            if s == '':\n                continue\n            # process\n\n   But the problem says to read from stdin.\n\n   Since the problem is small, we can use:\n\n        import sys\n        input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        for line in input_lines:\n            s = line.strip()\n            if s == '':\n                continue\n            # process\n\n   But the problem says \"first input line\", so we are reading sequentially.\n\n   However, the original code using input() is simpler.\n\n   But note: input() raises EOFError when there is no input. \n\n   We can handle EOFError:\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                s = input().strip()\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n            if s == '':\n                continue   # but the problem says non-empty, so this might not occur, but just in case.\n            # process s\n\n   But the problem says non-empty, so we can assume s != ''.\n\n   However, to be safe, we can do:\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                s = input().strip()\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n            if s == '':\n                # Skip empty lines, but the problem says non-empty, so this is an error in input? \n                # But if the input has empty lines, skip.\n                continue\n            # process\n\n   But the problem says the string is non-empty, so we assume no empty lines.\n\n   We'll go with the simple version:\n\n        while True:\n            s = input().strip()\n            if s == '':\n                break\n            n = len(s)\n            ans = 0\n            for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n                seen = set()\n                found = False\n                for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                    substr = s[i:i+L]\n                    if substr in seen:\n                        ans = L\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                    seen.add(substr)\n                if found:\n                    break\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution should efficiently handle all edge cases.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters within a string that repeats at least once, allowing for overlapping occurrences. For example, in the string \"ababa\", the substring \"aba\" appears twice starting at positions 0 and 2.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the string from the largest possible length down to the smallest. For each length, we examine all substrings of that length and use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, we immediately return its length as the result since we are checking lengths in descending order, ensuring the first valid length found is the longest possible.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over possible substring lengths from the maximum (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it generates all substrings of that length and checks for duplicates using a set. If a duplicate is found, the algorithm records the length and exits early, optimizing performance by leveraging the descending order check.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3) due to nested loops (length and substring generation), but given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is efficient enough. The space complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case, as we store all unique substrings for the current length.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    out_lines = []\n    for line in data:\n        s = line.strip()\n        if s == '':\n            continue\n        n = len(s)\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found_duplicate = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    found_duplicate = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found_duplicate:\n                break\n        out_lines.append(str(ans))\n    \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once from standard input and split into lines. Each line is processed individually.\n2. **Processing Each String**: For each non-empty line, the algorithm initializes the maximum possible substring length (n-1) and checks each length from largest to smallest.\n3. **Checking Substrings**: For each length, the algorithm generates all substrings of that length and checks for duplicates using a set. If a duplicate is found, the length is recorded, and the loop exits early to ensure efficiency.\n4. **Output**: The results for all test cases are collected in a list and printed at once, each on a new line. This approach ensures optimal performance and handles all edge cases, including strings with no repeating substrings (outputting 0).",
