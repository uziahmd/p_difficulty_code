Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n We are going to read three lines from stdin.\n The idea is to check if the third string (the pile) contains exactly the letters of the first two strings, with the exact counts.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the three lines and strip any newline characters.\n 2. Combine the first two strings to form the target string (since we need to form both names).\n 3. Compare the sorted list of characters of the combined target string with the sorted list of characters of the pile.\n 4. However, note: the example input is given as a list of three strings in a list, but the actual input is three separate lines.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n      SANTACLAUS\n      DEDMOROZ\n      SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\n   We combine \"SANTACLAUS\" and \"DEDMOROZ\" to get \"SANTACLAUSDED MOROZ\" (without space) -> \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\"\n\n But wait, let's count the example: \n   Guest: SANTACLAUS -> 11 letters\n   Host: DEDMOROZ -> 8 letters\n   Combined length: 19\n\n   Pile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> Let's count: \n        SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS -> \n        S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S -> 19 letters.\n\n However, note that the example output is \"YES\".\n\n But note: the example input provided in the problem is a list of three strings. The sample input is:\n\n   ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n   Input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the host's name, the third line contains the pile.\n\n So, we read three lines.\n\n However, in the example input provided in the problem statement, there are three examples. But the example input format is:\n\n   Example 1:\n     Line1: \"SANTACLAUS\"\n     Line2: \"DEDMOROZ\"\n     Line3: \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\"\n\n   Example 2:\n     Line1: \"PAPAINOEL\"\n     Line2: \"JOULUPUKKI\"\n     Line3: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   Example 3:\n     Line1: \"BABBONATALE\"\n     Line2: \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\"\n     Line3: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\"\n\n We are to output either \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n Approach:\n   - We can remove all spaces and newlines from each line (if any) and then combine the first two.\n   - Then, check if the sorted string of the combined two is equal to the sorted string of the third.\n\n But wait: what if the third string has extra letters? Then the sorted lists will be different.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a frequency counter for the letters.\n\n Steps using frequency counter:\n\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   s1 = first line (guest)\n   s2 = second line (host)\n   s3 = third line (pile)\n\n   target = s1 + s2\n\n   if Counter(target) == Counter(s3):\n        print(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n However, note: the problem says the letters are uppercase and no other characters.\n\n But what if the lengths differ? Then the Counters will automatically differ because the total counts per letter must match.\n\n But note: the pile might have more or less letters than the combined two.\n\n Example 2: \n   guest = \"PAPAINOEL\", host = \"JOULUPUKKI\", pile = \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\"\n\n   Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\" -> length 16\n   Pile: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" -> let's count: \n        J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I -> 20 letters.\n\n   But wait, the example output is \"NO\", so our method would work.\n\n However, the example 2 also says: \"letter 'P' is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter 'L'\".\n\n So, let's break down:\n\n   Combined: \"PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI\"\n   Letters: \n        P: 2 (from guest: two P's) and host: one P? -> actually guest: PAPA -> two P's, host: JOULUPUKKI -> one P? Actually, host: JOULUPUKKI has one P?",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether the letters found in the pile can be rearranged to exactly form the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the frequency of each letter in the pile matches exactly with the frequency of letters in the combined names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The input consists of three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Combine the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Frequency Count**: Use a frequency counter to compare the letters in the combined names with those in the pile. If the frequencies match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of letters required by comparing their counts, ensuring no extra or missing letters are present in the pile.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three lines from standard input, stripping any extraneous whitespace.\n2. **Combining Names**: The guest's name and host's name are concatenated into a single string.\n3. **Frequency Comparison**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile. If these counts match exactly, it means the pile contains precisely the letters needed to form both names without any extras or missing letters, hence the output \"YES\". Otherwise, the output is \"NO\".\n\nThis method ensures an efficient and straightforward solution by leveraging Python's built-in tools for handling character frequencies.",
