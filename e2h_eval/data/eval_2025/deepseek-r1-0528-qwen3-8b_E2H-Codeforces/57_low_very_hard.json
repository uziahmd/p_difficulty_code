His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n, x\n   list a of n integers (first tour points)\n   list b of n integers (second tour points)\n\n We know that Vasya is one of the participants, but we don't know which one. However, we know that there exist indices i, j such that a_i + b_j >= x.\n\n But note: the problem says that the two numbers (i, j) correspond to the same participant? Actually, no: the input has two lists, and each participant has one score in the first tour and one in the second. But the problem says: \"the results have only points, no names\". So we are given two arrays, and we know that Vasya's two scores are one from the first array and one from the second array (but we don't know which ones). And we know that his total is at least x.\n\n However, note the guarantee: there are two integers i, j (1<=i,j<=n) such that a_i + b_j >= x. But wait, actually, the problem says: \"there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x\", meaning that we can choose any two? Actually, no: because each participant is defined by one element from the first array and one from the second, but the same index? Actually, the problem does not specify that the same index must be used for the same participant. But note: the problem says \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours\", so we have n participants, each with an a_i and a b_j. However, the two arrays are given arbitrarily. \n\n But wait: the problem says \"the teacher has the results of the first and the second tour\" — meaning that we have two lists of n numbers. Then, the total points for a participant is a_i + b_j, but we don't know which a_i and b_j belong together. \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"the participants' points are given in the arbitrary order.\" So we can assume that the two arrays are independent: we are free to assign any a_i with any b_j? No, because each participant is uniquely identified by their two scores. However, note that the problem does not say that the two arrays are given for the same set of participants in the same order. \n\n But the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\"\n\n However, here's the catch: the problem does not say that the participant corresponding to a_i and b_j must be the same. Actually, the two arrays are given for the same set of participants, but independently. So we have n participants, and we know that for participant k, they have a score a_k (from the first array) and a score b_k (from the second array)? But the problem says the points are given in arbitrary order, meaning that the two arrays are just two sets of n numbers, and we are allowed to match them arbitrarily.\n\n Actually, let me clarify: the problem says \"each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad\", so there are n participants. The first array has n numbers (the first tour scores) and the second array has n numbers (the second tour scores). However, the assignment between the two arrays is arbitrary. \n\n This means: we can form a list of pairs (a_i, b_j) arbitrarily? Actually, no. Each participant has one first tour score and one second tour score. But we don't know which pair goes together. So we have two multisets: A and B. Then the entire set of participants is the multiset { (a_i, b_j) for all i,j }? Not exactly. Actually, we have n participants, so we need to assign each a_i to one b_j, and each b_j to one a_i. But note: the problem doesn't require the same index. \n\n However, the problem says: \"the participants' points are given in the arbitrary order\". So we can rearrange the two arrays arbitrarily. In fact, we can consider that we are given two multisets A and B, and then we can form a list of participants by taking any bijection between A and B? Or is it a multiset? Actually, the problem does not specify that the same score cannot appear multiple times.\n\n But note: the example input: \n     5 2\n     1 1 1 1 1\n     1 1 1 1 1\n\n Here, all are 1s. Then the total for each",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible places Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on the given points from two tours. The key insight is that we can independently sort the participants' points from both tours to find the optimal scenarios for Vasya's placement.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - Vasya's total points from both tours must be at least `x`.\n   - The participants are ranked by the sum of their points from both tours. If sums are equal, the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily.\n   - We need to find the best (highest) and worst (lowest) rank Vasya could get by considering all possible pairings of the first and second tour points.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Best Rank**: To maximize Vasya's rank, we should pair his highest possible score with another high score. This means pairing Vasya's best performance in one tour with the best available performance in the other tour.\n   - **Worst Rank**: To minimize Vasya's rank, we should pair his lowest possible score with the lowest available scores. However, we must ensure that his total points meet or exceed `x`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sorting**: Sort the first tour points in descending order and the second tour points in ascending order. This allows us to efficiently compute the best and worst possible scenarios.\n   - **Binary Search**: For each candidate pair of scores (one from each tour), use binary search to determine if a valid pairing exists that meets the minimum total `x`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - Sorting both arrays takes O(n log n) time.\n   - Binary search for each candidate pair takes O(log n) time, and there are O(n) candidate pairs, leading to an overall O(n log n) time complexity, which is efficient for the given constraints (n ≤ 10^5).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    b_list = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+2*n]))\n    \n    a_list.sort(reverse=True)\n    b_list.sort()\n    \n    best = 1\n    worst = 1\n    \n    total_needed = x\n    total = a_list[0] + b_list[-1]\n    if total < x:\n        best = 2\n    else:\n        for i in range(n):\n            s1 = a_list[i]\n            needed = total_needed - s1\n            if needed <= 0:\n                best = min(best, i+1)\n            else:\n                j = bisect.bisect_left(b_list, needed)\n                if j < n:\n                    best = min(best, i+1 + j+1)\n    \n    total_needed = x\n    total = a_list[-1] + b_list[0]\n    if total < x:\n        worst = 2\n    else:\n        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n            s1 = a_list[i]\n            needed = total_needed - s1\n            if needed <= 0:\n                worst = min(worst, n - i)\n            else:\n                j = bisect.bisect_left(b_list, needed, 0, n)\n                if j >= 0:\n                    index_in_sorted_b = j\n                    count_lower = j + 1\n                    count_higher = n - index_in_sorted_b - 1\n                    if count_higher > 0:\n                        worst = min(worst, n - i + count_lower + 1)\n                    else:\n                        worst = min(worst, n - i + count_lower)\n    \n    print(str(best) + \" \" + str(worst))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum required points `x`, and the lists of points from the first and second tours.\n2. **Sorting**: The first tour points are sorted in descending order to prioritize higher scores, and the second tour points are sorted in ascending order to facilitate efficient binary search operations.\n3. **Best Rank Calculation**:\n   - For each participant's score from the first tour, calculate the minimum required score from the second tour to meet `x`.\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest score in the sorted second tour list that, when added to the current first tour score, meets or exceeds `x`.\n   - Track the best rank by considering the earliest position where such a valid pair exists.\n4. **Worst Rank Calculation**:\n   - Similarly, for each participant's score from the first tour, determine the minimum required score from the second tour.\n   - Use binary search to find the largest score in the second tour list that, when paired, meets `x`.\n   - Track the worst rank by considering the latest position where such a valid pair exists.\n5. **Output**: The best and worst ranks are printed, providing Vasya's teacher with the range of possible placements for Vasya in the Olympiad.",
