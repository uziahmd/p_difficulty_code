Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates.\n 2. Since the string length is at most 100, we can do an O(n^3) solution by checking each substring and then checking if it appears elsewhere.\n\n However, we can do better by:\n   - Considering all substring lengths from the maximum possible (which is floor(n/2) because two copies must fit) down to 1.\n   - For a given length L, we can check every substring of length L and see if there is at least one duplicate.\n\n But note: the problem says occurrences can overlap. So even if the substring appears three times, that's okay.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"abcd\" -> no substring of length>=1 appears twice? Actually, let's check:\n        length 4: \"abcd\" -> only once -> skip.\n        length 3: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicates.\n        length 2: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> no duplicates.\n        length 1: \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" -> no duplicates.\n\n   Output: 0.\n\n   Input: \"ababa\"\n        Let's check for length 3: \n            \"aba\" -> appears at index0 and index2 (if we consider overlapping: \n                substring starting at index0: \"aba\"\n                substring starting at index2: \"aba\"\n            )\n            Also, \"bab\" appears at index1 and ... actually, \"bab\" appears at index1 and index3? \n            But wait, the entire string: \n                indices: \n                    0: 'a'\n                    1: 'b'\n                    2: 'a'\n                    3: 'b'\n                    4: 'a'\n\n            Substrings of length 3:\n                \"aba\" (index0), \"bab\" (index1), \"aba\" (index2), \"ba\" (index3) but wait, we are considering length 3, so index3: \"ba\" is length2? Actually, for length3, we have:\n                index0: \"aba\"\n                index1: \"bab\"\n                index2: \"aba\"\n\n            So \"aba\" appears twice. Also, what about \"bab\"? It appears once. So the maximum duplicate substring is \"aba\" with length 3.\n\n        But wait, the sample output for \"ababa\" is 3.\n\n   However, note that the problem says \"longest substring\". We are to return the length.\n\n Approach:\n\n   We can iterate over the possible lengths from n//2 down to 1 (or from max_length down to 1) and for each length, check if there exists a substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n   However, note: the two occurrences can be non-overlapping or overlapping. But the problem does not require non-overlapping. So we can use a set for each length.\n\n   Steps for a fixed length L:\n      Use a dictionary (or set) to record all distinct substrings of length L.\n      If any substring appears more than once, then we found that L is the length we want and we break.\n\n   But note: we are looking for the longest such substring. So we should start from the maximum possible length (which is n//2, because two disjoint copies would require 2*L <= n, but note: they can overlap, so actually we can have two overlapping copies even if the total length is less than 2*L. However, the condition is just that the same substring appears twice. The maximum L such that there are two (possibly overlapping) occurrences is limited by the fact that the substring must appear at least twice. The maximum L cannot exceed n-1 (but then two identical copies would require at least 2*L <= n + (L-1) because of overlap? Actually, no: the two occurrences can start at different positions. The maximum L can be up to floor((n+1)/2) ??? Let me think:\n\n   Example: \"aaa\" (n=3). Then the entire string is \"aaa\". The substring \"aa\" (length2) appears three times: \n        [0:2] = \"aa\", [1:3] = \"aa\". So maximum duplicate substring length is 2.\n\n   Actually, the maximum length L must satisfy that there are at least two starting indices i and j (with i < j) such that the substring from i to i+L-1 equals the substring from j to j+L-1.\n\n   The condition for two occurrences is that j >= i+1 (so they can overlap). The total length of the string must be at least (i+L-1)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, which means they don't necessarily have to be non-overlapping. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves checking all possible substrings of the input string to determine if any substring appears more than once. The key insight is that the longest such substring will have a length that allows it to appear at least twice in the string, possibly overlapping.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves iterating over all possible substring lengths from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, we check if there exists at least one substring of that length that appears more than once in the string. The first length found where this condition is met is our answer, as we are checking from the largest possible length downwards.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a nested loop approach where the outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths, and the inner loop checks all substrings of that length for duplicates. This approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging the fact that longer substrings are checked first.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, the solution remains efficient even with a brute-force approach. The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3), but this is manageable due to the small input size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    max_length = (n // 2) + 1\n    found = False\n\n    for L in range(max_length, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = True\n\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The length of the string is determined, and the maximum possible substring length (`max_length`) is set to half the string length plus one, ensuring we start checking from the largest possible substring.\n3. **Checking Substrings**: For each possible substring length from `max_length` down to 1, the code checks all substrings of that length. If a substring is encountered more than once, its length is printed, and the program exits immediately.\n4. **Output Result**: If no duplicate substring is found after checking all lengths, the program outputs 0, indicating no such substring exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging the problem constraints and ensures optimal performance for the given input size.",
