Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (possibly overlapping).\n 3. We can consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates, but since n<=100, we can do this without too much worry.\n\n However, note: We need the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n Alternate approach:\n - We can iterate over all possible substring lengths from the maximum down to 1.\n - For a given length L, check if there exists any substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: The problem says occurrences can overlap. So, \"aaa\" has two occurrences of \"aa\": one starting at index0 and one at index1.\n\n Steps:\n Let s be the input string.\n\n Option 1: \n   For L from floor(n/2) down to 1 (since the maximum length of a substring that can appear twice must be at most half the string length, but actually it's not necessarily half because of overlapping, but we can go from max_len = n down to 1, but then we break when we find one)\n\n Actually, the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice can be up to floor((n+1)/2) ? Not exactly. Consider \"abcabc\", the substring \"abc\" appears twice and has length 3 which is more than half of 6? Actually, the maximum length that can appear twice is at most floor(n/2) if we don't allow overlapping? But the problem allows overlapping.\n\n Example: \"aaa\" -> the substring \"aaa\" appears only once, but \"aa\" appears twice (at positions 0 and 1). So the maximum length in \"aaa\" is 2.\n\n However, consider \"ababa\": \n   substring \"aba\" appears twice (at index0 and index2) and the length is 3.\n\n So the maximum length can be as large as floor((n+1)/2)? Actually, we can have a substring of length L appearing twice even if L is large.\n\n But note: if we have a string of length n, the maximum length of a substring that appears twice is at most n-1 (if the entire string appears twice? no, because then we would need two copies, but the entire string can appear only once). Actually, we cannot have two non-overlapping copies of the entire string. But with overlapping, we can have a substring that is almost the entire string? \n\n However, consider: \"abcabc\" -> the entire string \"abcabc\" appears only once. But the substring \"abc\" (length 3) appears twice. The next candidate: can we have a substring of length 4? \"abca\" appears only once, \"bcab\" only once, etc. So the maximum is 3.\n\n So how to find the maximum L?\n\n We can iterate L from min(n, some_max) down to 1, and for each L, check all contiguous substrings of length L and see if any duplicate.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least twice\". So we need to check for duplicates.\n\n However, we can do:\n\n Let seen = {} for a fixed L, but we are iterating L from high to low.\n\n Alternatively, we can generate all substrings for each L and check for duplicates.\n\n Since n is at most 100, the total number of substrings is about n*(n+1)/2 which is around 5050, and we can check for duplicates by storing them in a set.\n\n But we want the maximum L for which there exists at least one substring that appears at least twice.\n\n Algorithm:\n\n   n = len(s)\n   # We'll consider L from n down to 1 (but note: if we take L = n, then we have only one substring, so no duplicate. Similarly, for L = n-1, we have two substrings? Actually, for L = n-1, we have n - (n-1) + 1 = 2 substrings? Only two if n>=2? Then we can check if these two substrings are equal? But wait, they are consecutive? Actually, the two substrings of length n-1 are the first n-1 and the last n-1. They are adjacent and might be different.\n\n   However, we can break early: if we find a duplicate for a given L, then we output L and break.\n\n   But what if there are multiple L with duplicates? We want the maximum L.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n        substrings = set()\n        # Actually, we need to check if any substring of length L appears more than once.\n        # We can use a dictionary to count occurrences? Or simply a set and then check if we have a",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, which means we need to consider all possible substrings of varying lengths and check for duplicates efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves examining all possible substrings of the input string to determine the longest one that appears at least twice. Given the constraints (string length ≤ 100), a brute-force approach is feasible.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings from the longest to the shortest. For each possible length, we generate all substrings of that length and use a set to detect duplicates. The first length where a duplicate is found is our answer since we are checking from the largest possible length downwards.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n) down to 1.\n   - For each length, generate all substrings of that length and store them in a set.\n   - If any substring appears more than once in the set, return the current length as the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3) due to nested loops (for each length, generating all substrings). However, given the constraint (n ≤ 100), this approach is efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    if n <= 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n        seen_substrings = set()\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            if substr in seen_substrings:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            seen_substrings.add(substr)\n\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and its length is determined. If the string length is 1 or less, the output is immediately 0 since no substring can appear twice.\n2. **Iterating Over Lengths**: The loop starts from the maximum possible substring length (n) down to 1. For each length, it checks all substrings of that length.\n3. **Checking for Duplicates**: For each substring of the current length, it checks if the substring has been seen before in the current iteration. If a duplicate is found, the current length is printed as the result, and the program exits.\n4. **Output Result**: If no duplicates are found for any length, the program outputs 0, indicating no such substring exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging the problem's constraints and using a set for quick duplicate detection.",
