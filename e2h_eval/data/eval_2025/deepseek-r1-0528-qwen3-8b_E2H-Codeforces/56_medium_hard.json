Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given R and B (each between 1 and 10) and then R lines for rebels and B lines for bases.\n We need to assign each base to exactly one rebel and each rebel to exactly one base such that the straight line segments (from base to its assigned rebel) do not intersect.\n\n Since the total number of points (R+B) is at most 20 (and R, B <=10), we can try to use combinatorial methods.\n\n However, note: the condition is that no two paths (i.e., the segments connecting a base to a rebel) intersect. But note: the problem does not require the entire set of segments to be non-intersecting in the plane? Actually, the problem says: \"any two (straight) paths from a base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect\".\n\n But note: the example input format is two integers R and B, then R lines for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\n Important: The assignment must be a perfect matching (bijection). And the condition is that the segments connecting the bases to their assigned rebels do not cross.\n\n However, note that the bases and rebels are distinct sets. We have R rebels and B bases, and we are to assign each base to one rebel (so if R != B, there is no matching? Actually, the problem states: \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\", meaning that we need a bijection. So R must equal B? \n\n But wait, the input says: \"The first line contains two space-separated integers R, B\", and then R lines and then B lines. The condition for perfect matching requires |R| = |B|. However, the problem says \"each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\" and \"every base has exactly one guardian\". Therefore, if R != B, it's impossible.\n\n However, looking at the example: \n Example 1: \"3 3 ...\" -> R=3, B=3 -> matching possible.\n Example 2: \"2 1 ...\" -> R=2, B=1 -> no matching because we cannot assign two bases (but wait, there is only 1 base) so we need to assign 1 base to 2 rebels? That would leave one rebel without a base, but the problem says each spaceship must have one base. So indeed, we require R == B.\n\n But wait, the example input second example: \"2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1\" -> R=2, B=1, which is not equal. Then the output is 'No'. So we can immediately output 'No' if R != B.\n\n However, note the problem statement says: \"if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". This implies R must equal B.\n\n Therefore, the first check: if R != B, then output 'No'.\n\n Now, if R == B (let n = R = B), we have n rebels and n bases.\n\n How to check for non-intersecting matching?\n\n We can consider that the matching is a set of n segments from a set of n rebels to a set of n bases. We need to assign each base to a rebel without crossing.\n\n Note: The problem does not require the entire set of points to be in any particular order. But note that the condition is that the segments do not intersect.\n\n However, note: two segments AB and CD (where A,B are rebels or bases? Actually, the segment is from a base to a rebel. So we have two segments: (base_i, rebel_j) and (base_k, rebel_l). They should not cross.\n\n How to check for non-intersection? We can use the standard method for checking if two line segments intersect. But note: the problem says \"any two (straight) paths\" do not intersect. So all pairs of segments must not intersect.\n\n But note: the segments are drawn between two distinct sets. However, the problem does not specify that the rebels and bases are in convex position or anything. Also, note that the rebels and bases are distinct and no three points are collinear.\n\n However, we are allowed to choose the matching arbitrarily. So we need to know: Is there a perfect matching (bijection) between the n bases and the n rebels such that when we draw the n segments (from base i to rebel j, for each base i) they do not cross?\n\n Alternatively, we can think: we want to assign each base to a unique rebel and have the segments not cross.\n\n How about we fix an ordering? Note: In the plane, two segments (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) (where a1, a2 are bases and b1, b2 are rebels) do not cross if and only if the two pairs (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) form a non-crossing matching? \n\n There is a known fact: a set of non-crossing segments between two sets of points (if the points are in general position) can be found by sorting the points appropriately.\n\n Idea: \n Step 1: If R != B, output 'No'.\n Step 2: Let n = R = B.\n\n We have two sets: \n   Rebels: list of coordinates R_list\n   Bases: list of coordinates B_list\n\n We can try to sort both sets. But what is the canonical way to get a non-crossing matching?\n\n Consider: if we sort both the rebels and the bases by x-coordinate, then we can connect the i-th smallest base to the i-th smallest rebel. Then check if the segments cross.\n\n However, is that sufficient? Not necessarily. Consider:\n\n   Base: [(0,0), (1,0)]\n   Rebel: [(-1,0), (2,0)]\n\n Connecting (0,0) to (-1,0) and (1,0) to (2,0): these are two horizontal segments that don't cross.\n\n But now consider:\n\n   Base: [(0,0), (1,0)]\n   Rebel: [(0,1), (1,-1)]\n\n If we sort by x: \n   Bases: [(0,0), (1,0)]\n   Rebels: [(0,1), (1,-1)]\n\n Then we connect (0,0) to (0,1) and (1,0) to (1,-1). These are two vertical lines? Actually, the first is a vertical line from (0,0) to (0,1) and the second from (1,0) to (1,-1). They don't cross.\n\n But what if we have:\n\n   Base: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n   Rebel: [(1,1), (1,-1)]\n\n Sort by x: \n   Bases: [(0,0), (2,0)]\n   Rebels: [(1,1), (1,-1)]\n\n Connect (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,0) to (1,-1). These two segments cross at (1,0).\n\n So the naive sorting by x and connecting in order does not guarantee non-crossing.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following idea:\n\n We can fix an outermost base and an outermost rebel. But note: the problem does not specify any ordering.\n\n Another idea: use a recursive backtracking to try all permutations? Since n<=10, we have up to 10! = 3628800, which is acceptable in worst-case. But 10! is about 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Python if implemented carefully.\n\n However, note: we have two sets of size n (n<=10). We need to assign each base to a rebel. We can represent the matching as a permutation: for each base i, we assign a rebel j.\n\n Steps for backtracking:\n\n   Let bases = list of base coordinates (size n)\n   Let rebels = list of rebel coordinates (size n)\n\n   We want to find a bijection f: {0,...,n-1} -> {0,...,n-1} such that for the matching defined by the segments (bases[i], rebels[f(i)]) for i=0..n-1, no two segments cross.\n\n   How to check for crossing between two segments (i, j) and (k, l)? We have four distinct points: \n        A = bases[i], B = rebels[f(i)]\n        C = bases[k], D = rebels[f(k)]\n\n   The segments are AB and CD. They cross if and only if the points A, B and C, D are interleaved. \n\n   We can use the orientation method: \n        Let orient(A, B, C) = (Bx - Ax)*(Cy - Ay) - (By - Ay)*(Cx - Ax)\n        Similarly, orient(A, B, D), etc.\n\n   Two segments AB and CD intersect if:\n        orient(A, B, C) * orient(A, B, D) < 0 and\n        orient(C, D, A) * orient(C, D, B) < 0\n\n   But note: we have two segments (A,B) and (C,D). The condition for intersection of two line segments (without requiring proper intersection, but since no three points are collinear, we don't have to worry about degenerate cases) is:\n\n        (orient(A, B, C) * orient(A, B, D) < 0) and (orient(C, D, A) * orient(C, D, B) < 0)\n\n   However, there is a simpler condition: the two segments AB and CD intersect if and only if the points A and B separate the points C and D, and vice versa.\n\n   But note: the four points are distinct and no three are collinear.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        bool1 = (orient(A, B, C) * orient(A, B, D) < 0)\n        bool2 = (orient(C, D, A) * orient(C, D, B) < 0)\n\n        Then the segments intersect if both bool1 and bool2 are true.\n\n   However, we must note: if two segments share a point, then they don't cross? But in our matching, the bases and rebels are disjoint sets (given: no two points coincide). So the four points are distinct.\n\n   Therefore, we can write a helper function:\n\n        def segments_intersect(p1, p2, p3, p4):\n            # p1, p2 define the first segment, p3, p4 the second.\n            def orient(o, a, b):\n                # returns (a.x - o.x)*(b.y - o.y) - (a.y - o.y)*(b.x - o.x)\n                x1 = a[0] - o[0]\n                y1 = a[1] - o[1]\n                x2 = b[0] - o[0]\n                y2 = b[1] - o[1]\n                return x1 * y2 - x2 * y1\n\n            o1 = orient(p1, p2, p3)\n            o2 = orient(p1, p2, p4)\n            if o1 * o2 < 0:\n                # The points p3 and p4 are on opposite sides of the line p1p2\n                o3 = orient(p3, p4, p1)\n                o4 = orient(p3, p4, p2)\n                if o3 * o4 < 0:\n                    return True\n            return False\n\n   However, note: this condition is symmetric. But we must be cautious: the above condition is standard.\n\n   But wait: there is a well-known condition for two segments (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) to intersect:\n\n        def ccw(A, B, C):\n            return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\n        def segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n            o1 = ccw(A, C, B)\n            o2 = ccw(A, D, B)\n            o3 = ccw(C, A, D)\n            o4 = ccw(C, B, D)\n            if ((o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0)):\n                return True\n            return False\n\n   But wait, the standard method uses four ccw checks. However, note that our condition above is actually equivalent to checking the two conditions independently. But note: the standard method also works.\n\n   However, there is a catch: sometimes the segments are collinear? But the problem states: no three points are collinear. So we don't have to worry about zero.\n\n   But note: the four points are distinct and no three are collinear, so the above condition is safe.\n\n   However, let me verify with an example:\n\n        A = (0,0), B=(2,0), C=(1,1), D=(1,-1)\n\n        Segment AB is from (0,0) to (2,0) and CD is from (1,1) to (1,-1).\n\n        Check: AB and CD should not intersect.\n\n        Using our function:\n\n          o1 = orient((0,0), (2,0), (1,1)) = (2-0)*(1-0) - (0-0)*(1-0) = 2*1 - 0 = 2\n          o2 = orient((0,0), (2,0), (1,-1)) = (2-0)*(-1-0) - (0-0)*(1-0) = 2*(-1) - 0 = -2\n          o1 * o2 = 2 * (-2) = -4 < 0 -> condition1 holds.\n\n          Now check the other side: \n          o3 = orient((1,1), (1,-1), (0,0)) = (1-1)*(0-1) - (-1-1)*(0-1) = 0 - (-2)*(-1) = 0 - 2 = -2\n          o4 = orient((1,1), (1,-1), (2,0)) = (1-1)*(0-1) - (-1-1)*(2-1) = 0 - (-2)*1 = 2\n          o3 * o4 = -2 * 2 = -4 < 0 -> condition2 holds.\n\n          Then we return True, but they shouldn't intersect.\n\n        Wait, why? Let me plot: \n          AB is the x-axis from (0,0) to (2,0). \n          CD is the vertical line from (1,1) to (1,-1). \n          They do not intersect because the vertical line goes from y=-1 to y=1, and the x-axis from x=0 to x=2, but the vertical line is at x=1 and the x-axis at y=0. They meet at (1,0) but (1,0) is on AB and also on CD? \n\n        However, note: the segment CD goes from (1,1) to (1,-1) and includes (1,0). And AB includes (1,0). So they do intersect at (1,0).\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"any two (straight) paths ... do not intersect\". So even if they just touch at an endpoint, that is an intersection? \n\n        Let me read the problem: \"any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane\"\n\n        Typically, in computational geometry, we consider endpoints as part of the segment. So if two segments share an endpoint, then they intersect.\n\n        But note: the bases and rebels are distinct sets. Therefore, the endpoints of the segments are either a base or a rebel, and no two bases coincide, and no two rebels coincide, and no base equals a rebel. So the four endpoints are distinct.\n\n        In the example above, (1,0) is not a base or a rebel? Actually, the example I used: \n          Base: [(0,0), (2,0)] -> wait, no, in the example I connected base (0,0) to rebel (1,1) and base (2,0) to rebel (1,-1). Then the four points are: (0,0), (1,1), (2,0), (1,-1). The point (1,0) is not one of them, so the segments do not share an endpoint.\n\n        Let me recalc with the correct points: \n          Segment1: (0,0) to (1,1) and Segment2: (2,0) to (1,-1)\n\n        Now, check intersection:\n\n          Condition1: \n            o1 = orient((0,0), (1,1), (2,0)) = (1-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) = 1*0 - 1*2 = -2\n            o2 = orient((0,0), (1,1), (1,-1)) = (1-0)*(-1-0) - (1-0)*(1-0) = 1*(-1) - 1*1 = -1-1 = -2\n            o1 * o2 = (-2)*(-2)=4 >=0 -> condition1 fails.\n\n          Condition2: \n            o3 = orient((2,0), (1,-1), (0,0)) = (1-2)*(0-0) - (-1-0)*(0-2) = (-1)*0 - (-1)*(-2) = 0 - 2 = -2\n            o4 = orient((2,0), (1,-1), (1,1)) = (1-2)*(1-0) - (-1-0)*(1-2) = (-1)*1 - (-1)*(-1) = -1 - 1 = -2\n            o3 * o4 = (-2)*(-2)=4 >=0 -> condition2 fails.\n\n        So no intersection.\n\n        Now, let me test the crossing example:\n\n        Example: Base: [(0,0), (2,0)] and Rebel: [(1,1), (1,-1)] but we want to connect (0,0) to (1,-1) and (2,0) to (1,1). Then the segments are (0,0)-(1,-1) and (2,0)-(1,1). Do they cross?\n\n        Condition1 for segment (0,0)-(1,-1) and (2,0)-(1,1):\n\n          o1 = orient((0,0), (1,-1), (2,0)) = (1-0)*(0-0) - (-1-0)*(2-0) = 1*0 - (-1)*2 = 0 + 2 = 2\n          o2 = orient((0,0), (1,-1), (1,1)) = (1-0)*(1-0) - (-1-0)*(1-0) = 1*1 - (-1)*1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n          o1 * o2 = 2*2 = 4 >=0 -> condition1 fails.\n\n        Condition2 for segment (2,0)-(1,1) and (0,0)-(1,-1):\n\n          o3 = orient((2,0), (1,1), (0,0)) = (1-2)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(0-2) = (-1)*0 - 1*(-2) = 0+2=2\n          o4 = orient((2,0), (1,1), (1,-1)) = (1-2)*(-1-0) - (1-0)*(1-2) = (-1)*(-1) - 1*(-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n          o3 * o4 = 2*2=4>=0 -> condition2 fails.\n\n        So no intersection? But wait, the two segments (0,0)-(1,-1) and (2,0)-(1,1) do cross at (1,0) if we extend them? Actually, they do not: the first segment goes from (0,0) to (1,-1) (downward) and the second from (2,0) to (1,1) (upward). They cross at (1,0) but (1,0) is not an endpoint. \n\n        However, wait: (0,0) to (1,-1) is the line y = x, and (2,0) to (1,1) is the line from (2,0) to (1,1): slope = (1-0)/(1-2) = 1/-1 = -1, so y = -x + 2. The intersection of y=x and y=-x+2 is x = 1, y=1. But wait, that is (1,1) which is an endpoint of the second segment. \n\n        Actually, (1,1) is the endpoint of the second segment, and (1,-1) is the endpoint of the first. The first segment doesn't reach (1,1) because (1,1) is not on the segment (0,0) to (1,-1). Similarly, the second segment doesn't reach (1,-1). So they do not share an endpoint, but do they cross?\n\n        Let me check: \n          First segment: (0,0) to (1,-1): parametric equations: x=t, y=-t, t from 0 to 1.\n          Second segment: (2,0) to (1,1): parametric equations: x=2-s, y=0+s, s from 0 to 1 -> so when s=1, (1,1). Then the equation: from (2,0) to (1,1): y = (1-0)/(1-2)*(x-2) + 0 = -1*(x-2) = -x+2.\n\n        Now, set y = -x+2 and y = -t, and x=t. Then: t = -t+2 -> 2t=2 -> t=1. Then y=-1. But the second segment at x=1 has y=1 (because from (2,0) to (1,1): when x=1, y=1). So the first segment at x=1 is (1,-1) and the second at x=1 is (1,1). They do not meet.\n\n        Actually, the two lines cross at (1,1) and (1,-1)? No, wait: the first segment does not extend to (1,1) because when x=1, y=-1, and the second segment does not extend to (1,-1) because when x=1, y=1.\n\n        So they do not cross.\n\n        Now, let me take an actual crossing example:\n\n        Example: Base: [(0,0), (0,2)] and Rebel: [(1,1), (-1,1)]\n\n        Then if we connect (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,2) to (-1,1): \n\n        Segment1: (0,0) to (1,1) -> y=x\n        Segment2: (0,2) to (-1,1) -> slope = (1-2)/(-1-0) = (-1)/(-1)=1, so y = x + 2? Actually, from (0,2) to (-1,1): \n            y = 1*x + 2? Let me check: at x=0, y=2; at x=-1, y=1 -> 1 = -1 + 2 -> 1=1, yes.\n\n        The two lines: y=x and y=x+2. They are parallel and never cross. But wait, they are not the same line and parallel, so they don't cross.\n\n        Another example: Base: [(0,0), (2,2)] and Rebel: [(1,1), (1,-1)]\n\n        Connect (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,2) to (1,-1):\n\n        Segment1: (0,0) to (1,1): y=x\n        Segment2: (2,2) to (1,-1): slope = (-1-2)/(1-2) = (-3)/(-1)=3, so y-2=3(x-2) -> y=3x-4\n\n        Intersection: x=3x-4 -> 2x=4 -> x=2, y=2. But (2,2) is the endpoint of the second segment and the first segment only goes to (1,1). So they meet at (2,2) which is an endpoint of the second segment, but not of the first. So they don't share an endpoint. But the first segment doesn't go beyond (1,1). \n\n        Actually, the two segments: \n          Segment1: from (0,0) to (1,1)\n          Segment2: from (2,2) to (1,-1)\n\n        They do not share an endpoint. Do they cross? \n\n        The line for segment1: y=x (for x from 0 to 1)\n        The line for segment2: from (2,2) to (1,-1): y = 3x-4 (for x from 1 to 2)\n\n        For x in [0,1]: the segment1 is defined. For x in [1,2]: segment2 is defined. At x=1, segment1 ends at (1,1) and segment2 is at (1, -2)? Wait, wait: at x=1, segment2: y=3*1-4 = -1. So (1,-1) is the endpoint. \n\n        Now, the two segments: \n          Segment1: (0,0) to (1,1)\n          Segment2: (2,2) to (1,-1)\n\n        They do not cross because the first segment is in the first quadrant and the second is from (2,2) down to (1,-1). They might meet at (1,?) but the first segment at x=1 is (1,1) and the second at x=1 is (1,-1). So no common point.\n\n        Let me take a crossing example: \n          Base: [(0,0), (0,4)]\n          Rebel: [(1,1), (-1,3)]\n\n        Connect (0,0) to (1,1) and (0,4) to (-1,3)\n\n        Segment1: (0,0) to (1,1): y=x\n        Segment2: (0,4) to (-1,3): slope = (3-4)/(-1-0)= (-1)/(-1)=1, so y=x+4? \n          At x=0, y=4 -> 4 = 0+4 -> holds.\n          At x=-1, y=3 -> 3 = -1+4 -> 3=3, holds.\n\n        So the two lines: y=x and y=x+4.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between a set of Rebel spaceships and a set of bases such that the straight-line segments connecting each base to its assigned spaceship do not intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between the bases and spaceships to see if any permutation satisfies the non-intersecting condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking for a bijection (perfect matching) between two sets of points (bases and spaceships) such that no two connecting segments intersect. The key observation is that if the number of bases and spaceships differ, it's impossible to form such a matching, so we immediately return \"No\" in that case.\n2. **Intersection Check**: For each candidate matching (permutation of assignments), we need to verify that no two segments intersect. This involves using computational geometry techniques to check if two line segments intersect by examining their orientations.\n3. **Backtracking with Permutations**: Since the constraints are small (R and B up to 10), we can generate all possible permutations of assignments between bases and spaceships. For each permutation, we check all pairs of segments to ensure none intersect.\n4. **Efficiency**: The approach leverages the fact that the maximum number of permutations (10! = 3,628,800) is manageable within typical time constraints for Python, especially given the problem's input size limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    R = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    \n    rebels = []\n    index = 2\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(data[index])\n        y = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(data[index])\n        y = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        \n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n        \n    n = R\n    \n    def orient(A, B, C):\n        ax, ay = A\n        bx, by = B\n        cx, cy = C\n        return (bx - ax) * (cy - ay) - (by - ay) * (cx - ax)\n        \n    def segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n        o1 = orient(a1, a2, b1)\n        o2 = orient(a1, a2, b2)\n        if o1 == 0 or o2 == 0:\n            return False\n            \n        if (o1 < 0 and o2 < 0) or (o1 > 0 and o2 > 0):\n            return False\n            \n        o3 = orient(b1, b2, a1)\n        o4 = orient(b1, b2, a2)\n        if (o3 < 0 and o4 < 0) or (o3 > 0 and o4 > 0):\n            return False\n            \n        return True\n        \n    bases_list = list(bases)\n    rebels_list = list(rebels)\n    \n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(n)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i + 1, n):\n                base_i = bases_list[i]\n                rebel_i = rebels_list[perm[i]]\n                base_j = bases_list[j]\n                rebel_j = rebels_list[perm[j]]\n                \n                if segments_intersect(base_i, rebel_i, base_j, rebel_j):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n                \n        if valid:\n            found = True\n            break\n            \n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, parsing the number of Rebels (R) and Bases (B), followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Immediate Check**: If the counts of bases and spaceships differ, the solution immediately outputs \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Orientation and Intersection Check**: The `orient` function calculates the orientation of three points, which helps determine the relative position of points. The `segments_intersect` function checks if two line segments intersect by verifying their orientations.\n4. **Permutation Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible assignments of bases to spaceships are generated. For each permutation, the solution checks if any pair of segments intersects. If a valid assignment is found where no segments intersect, it outputs \"Yes\"; otherwise, it outputs \"No\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible matchings by leveraging permutations and geometric intersection checks, ensuring correctness within the problem constraints.",
