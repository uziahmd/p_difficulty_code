They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given a graph with n nodes and m edges. Each edge has two numbers: gcd and lcm.\n\n We know that for an edge (u, v) with gcd = g and lcm = l, the numbers of mushrooms on u and v must satisfy:\n   Let the numbers be a and b.\n   Then, g = gcd(a, b) and l = lcm(a, b).\n\n Also, note the identity: a * b = g * l * gcd(a//g, b//g)   [But actually, we have: a = g * a', b = g * b', and then lcm(a,b)=g*a'*b'//gcd(a',b')?]\n\n Actually, we have:\n   g = gcd(a, b)\n   l = lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // g\n\n So, we can write: a * b = g * l.\n\n Moreover, we know that the prime factorization of a and b must be such that the minimum exponent for each prime in a and b is the exponent in g, and the maximum is the exponent in l.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require a unique solution, so we can choose one.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if the input data is consistent.\n\n Conditions for an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l:\n   - It must hold that g divides both a and b, and also g divides l, and l must be divisible by g (which is always true because l = (a*b)//g and g divides a and b so divides a*b, but note: we don't know a and b yet).\n   - Also, from the identity, we must have: g <= a, b <= l, and moreover, we must have that g divides l (since g divides a and a divides l? Actually, note: \n        Since g = gcd(a, b), then g divides a and b, and since a divides l (because l is the lcm and must be divisible by a) and similarly for b, then g divides l.\n\n But wait, let's derive:\n   Let a = g * x, b = g * y, then we require that gcd(x,y)=1 and l = g * x * y (because lcm(a,b) = g * x * y / gcd(x,y) = g*x*y). Therefore, we must have that l is divisible by g and the quotient l//g must be equal to x * y, and x and y must be coprime.\n\n 2. However, we have multiple edges and nodes. The entire graph must be consistent.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can try to assign values to the nodes. Note that the entire graph might be disconnected? The problem says \"no road connects lawn to itself\" and \"no two lawns are connected by more than one road\", but doesn't specify connectivity.\n\n But note: the problem says \"restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn\". So even if the graph is disconnected, we must assign a value to every lawn.\n\n How?\n\n Idea: For each edge, we know that the two numbers must be multiples of the gcd and their product must be g*l. Moreover, the two numbers must be divisors of the lcm (actually, they must divide the lcm? Not necessarily, because the lcm is the least common multiple, so each number must divide the lcm? Actually, yes: because the lcm is the smallest number that is a multiple of both, so both numbers divide the lcm.\n\n So for an edge (u, v): \n   a must divide l and b must divide l.\n\n Additionally, we have: gcd(a, b) = g and lcm(a, b) = l.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. For each edge, check that g divides l (otherwise, invalid). Also, the product of the two numbers (if we knew them) must be g*l, but we don't know the numbers.\n\n 2. We can use the following: for each node, we can consider the constraints from all incident edges.\n\n Alternatively, we can set up equations for each node. However, the problem is about assigning numbers to nodes such that for each edge (u, v) the gcd(u, v) is given and the lcm(u, v) is given.\n\n Another idea:\n\n   Let the number at node i be x_i.\n\n   For an edge (u, v) with gcd = g and lcm = l:\n        gcd(x_u, x_v) = g\n        lcm(x_u, x_v) = l\n\n   Then, we know:\n        x_u * x_v = g * l   [if we assume that the product of two numbers is the product of their gcd and lcm? Actually, we have: gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a*b. So yes.]\n\n   So, for each edge, we have: x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\n   But wait: is that always true?\n        Yes: because a = g * a', b = g * b', and then lcm(a,b) = g * a' * b' / gcd(a', b')? Actually, no: the standard identity is: \n            a * b = gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b)\n\n        Example: a=4, b=6 -> gcd=2, lcm=12, and 4*6=24=2*12. So yes.\n\n   Therefore, we can write for each edge: x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\n   Now, we have a system of equations: for each edge, the product of the two node values is fixed.\n\n   But note: the graph may not be connected, and we have n nodes and m edges.\n\n   However, the system of multiplicative equations over the edges is a non-linear system. But we can use the following:\n\n   We can assign a value to one node arbitrarily (within constraints) and then propagate along the edges.\n\n   But note: the product condition is for pairs. This is similar to a graph where the product of adjacent nodes is fixed.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let's define an array x[0..n-1] for the n nodes.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        Step 1: Check for each edge (u, v) that g divides l. If not, output \"NO\".\n\n        Step 2: Then, we can consider that the entire graph is built from these products.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the same node might appear in multiple edges, and the product conditions must hold simultaneously.\n\n        We can use a BFS/DFS to traverse the graph and assign values.\n\n        But note: the equations are multiplicative. We can fix a starting node (say node 0) to a value, then use the edges to determine the adjacent nodes.\n\n        However, we have multiple edges and the graph might be cyclic. We must ensure consistency.\n\n        Also, note that the product condition gives x_v = (g*l) / x_u. But what if x_u is zero? The problem states that the numbers are at least 1, so no zeros.\n\n        But there is another issue: the gcd condition. We cannot only use the product condition, because the gcd condition must also hold.\n\n        Actually, the product condition is necessary but not sufficient. For example, if we have an edge (u, v) with gcd=2 and lcm=12, then the product must be 24. But the possible pairs (a,b) are (2,12), (4,6), (6,4), (12,2). However, note that the gcd condition must be 2. \n\n        In the pair (4,6): gcd(4,6)=2, which is correct. In (2,12): gcd(2,12)=2, correct. In (6,4): same as (4,6). In (12,2): same.\n\n        So the product condition is necessary, but we must also check the gcd condition.\n\n        However, we can use the product condition to assign values and then check the gcd condition on the assigned values.\n\n        But wait: if we assign x_u and x_v such that x_u * x_v = g*l, then the gcd condition might not hold. For example, if we have an edge with g=2, l=12, and we assign x_u=8 and x_v=3 (product 24, but 8*3=24) but then gcd(8,3)=1, which is not 2. So this assignment would fail the gcd condition.\n\n        Therefore, we must ensure that the gcd(x_u, x_v) is g.\n\n        How can we do that?\n\n        From the product condition, we have x_u = g * a, x_v = g * b, and then a*b = (g*l)/(g*g) = l/g, and gcd(a,b)=1? Actually, no: the standard representation is that we factor out the gcd.\n\n        Alternatively, note that the product condition and the gcd condition together imply that the two numbers must be of the form:\n            x_u = g * k, x_v = g * (l//g) // k\n        and then we require that gcd(k, (l//g)//k) == 1? Actually, no: the condition is that the gcd of the two numbers is g. So:\n\n            Let x_u = g * a, x_v = g * b, then gcd(a,b)=1 and l = g * a * b.\n\n        Why? Because the lcm(a,b) when gcd(a,b)=1 is a*b, so the lcm of the original numbers is g * a * b.\n\n        Therefore, the condition is: \n            x_u = g * a, x_v = g * b, with gcd(a,b)=1 and a*b = l//g.\n\n        So the product condition is necessary and the gcd condition then requires that the cofactors (after removing g) are coprime.\n\n        So for an edge, we can set the two numbers as divisors of l//g (which is an integer because we already checked that g divides l) and that multiply to l//g and are coprime.\n\n        However, how do we assign the entire graph?\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n          Let d = l // g. Then the two numbers must be two divisors of d (not necessarily, but their product is d and they are coprime) and then the actual numbers are g times those divisors.\n\n        But note: the same node might be involved in multiple edges. So we must assign the same value to the node in all edges it is part of.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          We'll build a graph where each edge is represented by (u, v, g, l) and we also store the product = g*l.\n\n        Then, we can use a union-find or DFS to assign values.\n\n        However, note: the product condition must hold for every edge, and the gcd condition must hold for every edge.\n\n        But the system is underdetermined. We can assign arbitrary divisors as long as the product condition holds and the gcd condition holds.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          Since the entire graph must have consistent assignments, we can use the product condition to set:\n\n            x[u] * x[v] = g_uv * l_uv   for each edge (u,v)\n\n          This is a system of multiplicative equations. We can fix one node (say node 0) to a value, then use the edges to set the neighbors.\n\n          But note: the equations are multiplicative and the graph may have cycles. Then, we must check that the product around a cycle is consistent.\n\n        However, the product condition is defined per edge, so for a cycle, the product of the edge products must be 1? Actually, let's say we have a cycle: a-b-c-a.\n\n          a*b = P_ab\n          b*c = P_bc\n          c*a = P_ca\n\n          Then, (a*b)*(b*c)*(c*a) = P_ab * P_bc * P_ca\n          => a^2 * b^2 * c^2 = P_ab * P_bc * P_ca\n\n          But also, from the equations, we can express everything in terms of a. Then we get a quadratic equation. Alternatively, we can fix a and then solve for b and c.\n\n        However, there is an easier way: we can take logarithms and turn the problem into an additive one (like electrical networks) but that might lead to floating point inaccuracies.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a graph coloring approach for multiplicative constraints? \n\n        But note: the problem does not require a unique solution, so we can choose one.\n\n        Steps for assignment:\n\n          1. For each edge, we know the product. We can assign a value to node 0 arbitrarily (but we must choose a value that is consistent with the gcd conditions). However, the gcd condition depends on the divisor representation.\n\n        This becomes complicated.\n\n        Another approach: factorize the numbers.\n\n        However, the constraints: n, m up to 10^5? (the problem says n, m and the numbers up to 10^6, but n and m can be up to 10^5? Actually, the problem statement says: \"The first line contains two numbers n and m (1≤n,m≤10^5)\".\n\n        So we need an efficient solution.\n\n        Let's reframe:\n\n          Condition for an edge (u, v): \n            x_u * x_v = g * l   (1)\n            gcd(x_u, x_v) = g   (2)\n\n          From (2): we can write x_u = g * a, x_v = g * b, with gcd(a,b)=1 and a*b = (g*l)//(g*g) = l//g.\n\n          So the value of a node must be divisible by the gcd of the edges it is incident to? Not exactly.\n\n        But note: we have multiple edges incident to a node. The value of the node must be a common multiple of the gcds of all edges incident to it? Actually, the value must satisfy the gcd condition for each edge.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set:\n\n          Let the value of node i be x_i.\n\n          For an edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, we have:\n            x_u * x_v = g * l   (equation A)\n            and x_u and x_v must be multiples of g, and then the cofactors must be coprime.\n\n        We can try to assign the entire graph by:\n\n          Step 1: For each edge, compute d = l // g. Then the two numbers must be two divisors (a, b) of d (meaning they divide d) such that a*b = d and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n          However, note: the divisors a and b must be such that x_u = g * a and x_v = g * b. Then, the same node might appear in multiple edges, so the value x_u must be the same in all edges.\n\n        So we can:\n\n          Build a graph where each edge has a set of candidate pairs (a, b) (with a*b = d, and gcd(a,b)=1). Then, we want to assign to each node a value that is consistent with the candidate pairs on the edges.\n\n        But the number of candidate pairs for an edge could be large (up to about 100 for d up to 10^6, because the number of divisors is small). And then we have up to 10^5 edges, which is too many.\n\n        Another idea: we know that the entire graph must be such that the value of a node is fixed by the product and the gcd conditions. However, we can also note:\n\n          The value of a node must be a divisor of the lcm of the entire graph? Or more precisely, the value must be such that for each edge, it is a divisor of the lcm of that edge? Actually, from the edge condition, the value must divide the lcm of the edge (because the lcm is the common multiple and the value is a divisor of the lcm). But wait, the value is a divisor of the lcm? Not necessarily: the lcm is the least common multiple, so the value must divide the lcm only if the value is one of the two numbers? Actually, yes: from the definition of lcm, we have that the value divides the lcm.\n\n        Therefore, for an edge (u, v) with lcm = l, we have x_u divides l and x_v divides l.\n\n        Then, the value for node u must divide the lcm of every edge incident to u? \n\n        Let L_u = product of the lcms of all edges incident to u? Actually, no, we can take the least common multiple of all the lcms of edges incident to u? But note: the value x_u must divide each of the lcms of the edges it is incident to. Therefore, x_u must divide the gcd of all the lcms of the edges incident to u? Actually, no: the value x_u must divide each individual lcm of the edges. So x_u must divide the greatest common divisor of all the lcms? Actually, no: the condition is that x_u divides each lcm (for each incident edge). Then, x_u must divide the greatest common divisor of all the lcms of the edges incident to u? \n\n        Let me think: \n          Suppose node u is incident to two edges: \n            Edge1: (u, v) with lcm = l1 -> then x_u divides l1.\n            Edge2: (u, w) with lcm = l2 -> then x_u divides l2.\n          Then x_u must divide gcd(l1, l2). \n\n        So for node u, we can define:\n\n            Let L_u = gcd_{for each edge incident to u} (lcm of that edge)\n\n        Then, x_u must divide L_u.\n\n        Similarly, from the product condition, we have that for each edge (u, v): x_u * x_v = g*l. \n\n        Now, we can set an upper bound for x_u: it must divide L_u and also be a divisor of the product condition.\n\n        But note: the product condition for an edge (u, v) is x_u * x_v = g*l, and we know g and l for that edge.\n\n        So, for each edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, we have:\n\n            x_u must divide l, and x_u must be a divisor of L_u (which is the gcd of all lcms of edges incident to u).\n\n        Then, we can iterate over the divisors of L_u for each node? But L_u might be large, and n up to 10^5, which is too slow.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          Step 1: Precompute for each node u, the value L_u = gcd_{e incident to u} (lcm(e)). If the node has no edges, then we have no constraint from the edges, but we still need to assign a value. However, if a node has no edges, then the product condition does not constrain it? Actually, the problem does not say anything about edges, so we can assign any positive integer? But wait, the problem says \"It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 10^6\", but the node without edges might be assigned a value arbitrarily.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn\". There are no constraints from edges for isolated nodes. So we can assign any positive integer. But wait, if the graph is disconnected, then we must assign independently.\n\n        But the problem does not specify that the entire map was connected. So we must handle disconnected graphs.\n\n        However, the problem does not require a unique solution, so we can assign any value for isolated nodes.\n\n        But note: the problem says the initial map had numbers at least 1 and at most 10^6. So we can assign a value between 1 and 10^6 arbitrarily? But the problem does not specify bounds for the restored values. Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were ...\", meaning that the original numbers were in [1,10^6]. But the restored numbers might be any positive integer? The problem does not restrict the range.\n\n        However, the example outputs are within the same range.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"restore any one\", so we can choose any positive integer for isolated nodes.\n\n        But let's read the problem statement again: \"use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn\". The map he has is the part with m roads. So for the other parts (nodes without edges) we have no constraints.\n\n        However, the problem does not say that the entire graph was connected. So we can assign arbitrarily.\n\n        Steps for the algorithm:\n\n        We are going to:\n\n          1. Read n, m and the m edges.\n\n          2. Build a graph with n nodes and m edges.\n\n          3. For each node, compute the gcd of the lcms of all incident edges. Let this be L[u].\n\n          4. For each edge (u, v) with gcd g and lcm l, we must have that g divides l (otherwise, invalid). Also, the value for u must divide L[u] and the value for v must divide L[v], and also for the edge: x_u * x_v = g*l.\n\n          5. We can set up a system:\n\n                Let x[u] be the value for node u.\n\n                Constraints:\n                  For each edge (u, v): x[u] * x[v] = g * l   (product condition)\n                  For each edge (u, v): gcd(x[u], x[v]) = g   (gcd condition)\n\n          6. We can use the product condition to relate the nodes. We can fix one node (say node 0) to a value, then use the edges to determine the neighbors.\n\n          However, the gcd condition is non-linear and we cannot directly fix the value arbitrarily.\n\n        Alternate Insight:\n\n          From the edge (u, v): \n            x[u] = g * a, x[v] = g * b, with gcd(a,b)=1 and a*b = l//g.\n\n          Then, the entire graph's node values must be of the form: x_i = g_i * a_i, but wait, the g_i (the gcd) is fixed per edge, but different edges might have different gcds.\n\n          Actually, the gcd condition is per edge. So the value x_i must be divisible by the gcd of the edge, but note: the gcd of an edge is the gcd of the two numbers, so it must divide both.\n\n          However, the value x_i might be divisible by a common divisor that is the gcd of several edges? Not necessarily.\n\n        After reading the problem again, note: the entire map was torn, but the original map had numbers for every lawn. The known roads are the m roads. The arrangement must satisfy the given gcd and lcm for the known roads.\n\n        We can use the following:\n\n          Since the product condition is linear (in logarithmic space) and the gcd condition is multiplicative, we can use the following:\n\n          Let F be the set of all prime factors that appear in any edge.\n\n          But the constraints on the numbers (up to 10^6) and n, m up to 10^5 make factorization too heavy.\n\n        Another idea: use two-coloring in logarithmic space? But the product condition is multiplicative.\n\n        Let me consider: if we take logarithm base 2, then the product condition becomes:\n\n            log2(x_u) + log2(x_v) = log2(g) + log2(l)\n\n        Then, we can define a value for each node: y_u = log2(x_u). Then we have a system of linear equations in the real numbers (logarithms). However, the logarithms must be such that 2^(y_u) is an integer (the value x_u). Moreover, the gcd condition must hold.\n\n        This seems too abstract.\n\n        We need a simpler approach.\n\n        Let's break down the problem:\n\n          Condition 1: For each edge, g divides l (if not, return \"NO\").\n          Condition 2: For each edge, the product condition: x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\n          Condition 3: For each edge, gcd(x_u, x_v) = g.\n\n        How to satisfy condition 3 with condition 2?\n\n          From condition 2: x_u * x_v = g * l.\n          Let x_u = g * a, x_v = l // a. Then, condition 3: gcd(g*a, l//a) = g.\n\n          Then, we require that gcd(a, l//a) = 1.\n\n          Why? Because:\n            gcd(g*a, l//a) = g * gcd(a, l/(g)) ? Not exactly.\n\n          Actually, note: l = g * (l//g) and we know that a * (l//a) = l//g? Wait, no:\n\n            We have: x_u * x_v = g*a * (l//a) = g * (l)   -> so l//a = (g*l) / (g*a) = l/a.\n\n          But then, we require that gcd(g*a, l/a) = g.\n\n          Let d = gcd(a, l/a). Then, we can write a = d * a', l/a = d * b', then gcd(a', b')=1.\n\n          Then, gcd(g*a, l/a) = gcd(g*d*a', d*b') = d * gcd(g*a', b').\n\n          We require that to be g.\n\n          So, d must divide g, and gcd(g*a', b') must be g/d.\n\n          This seems messy.\n\n        Alternatively, from the standard representation:\n\n          Let g0 = gcd(x_u, x_v). Then, we can write x_u = g0 * a, x_v = g0 * b, with gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n          And then, lcm(x_u, x_v) = g0 * a * b.\n\n          Therefore, we must have: g0 * a * b = l  => a * b = l // g0.\n\n          But note: the given gcd is g. So we require g0 = g.\n\n          Therefore, we must have g = gcd(x_u, x_v) and then a and b are coprime and a*b = l//g.\n\n          So the condition is automatically satisfied if we set x_u = g * a and x_v = g * b with a*b = l//g and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n        Therefore, the necessary and sufficient conditions for an edge are:\n\n          (i) g divides l.\n          (ii) There exist integers a, b such that a*b = l//g and gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n        Now, how to assign the entire graph?\n\n          We can try to assign to each node a value that is a multiple of some base value (the gcd of the edges incident to it?) but we don't know.\n\n        Let's define:\n\n          Let the value for node i be x_i.\n\n          For each edge (u, v): \n            x_u = g_uv * a_uv, x_v = g_uv * b_uv, with a_uv * b_uv = l_uv // g_uv and gcd(a_uv, b_uv)=1.\n\n          But the same node u appears in multiple edges, so the value x_u must be expressed in terms of the base g_uv in each edge.\n\n        However, note: the base g_uv is the gcd for that edge, and the value x_u must be divisible by g_uv for every edge incident to u.\n\n        Let G[u] = the greatest common divisor of all the g's of the edges incident to u. Then, x_u must be divisible by G[u] (if there is at least one edge). But wait, is that true?\n\n          Consider: for each edge incident to u, x_u must be divisible by the gcd of that edge. Therefore, x_u must be divisible by the greatest common divisor of all the edge-gcds? Actually, no: the gcd of the edge-gcds is not necessarily a divisor of x_u. Example:\n\n            Edge1: (u, v1) with gcd=g1, then x_u divisible by g1.\n            Edge2: (u, v2) with gcd=g2, then x_u divisible by g2.\n\n            Then x_u must be divisible by the least common multiple of g1 and g2? Actually, no: divisibility by g1 and g2 separately means divisible by the least common multiple of g1 and g2.\n\n          Therefore, let G[u] = lcm{ g for each edge incident to u }.\n\n          Then, x_u must be divisible by G[u].\n\n        Then, for each edge (u, v) with gcd=g and lcm=l, we have:\n\n          x_u = G[u] * k_u, but wait, we don't know the base. Alternatively, we can set:\n\n          x_u = M[u] * d[u]   where M[u] is the product of the primes with exponents from the edge gcds? \n\n        This is getting complicated.\n\n        Another idea: since the product condition is x_u * x_v = g*l, we can fix the value for one node arbitrarily (as long as it is divisible by the gcd of the edges incident to it) and then propagate.\n\n        However, the gcd condition must hold, which is determined by the product and the divisor.\n\n        Let me try a different approach:\n\n          We know that for an edge (u, v): x_u * x_v = g*l.\n\n          Let x_u = d * a, x_v = d * b, then we require that d divides both x_u and x_v, and then the gcd(x_u, x_v) = d * gcd(a,b). But we know the gcd is g. \n\n          So, d must be a divisor of g. \n\n          But wait, from the edge (u, v), we have g = gcd(x_u, x_v). Then, we can write:\n\n            x_u = g * a, x_v = g * b, with gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n          So d = g, and then a and b are coprime.\n\n          Therefore, the value of a node must be divisible by the gcd of the edge, but also, the entire value is the gcd times a coprime part.\n\n        Then, we can factor out the gcd of the incident edges to get a reduced value for the node.\n\n        Specifically, for a node u, let:\n\n          Let G[u] = the greatest common divisor of the gcd's of all edges incident to u. Actually, we need the least common multiple? \n\n        Actually, for node u, the value x_u must be divisible by the gcd of every incident edge. Therefore, x_u must be divisible by the least common multiple of all the edge-gcds incident to u.\n\n        Let LCM_g[u] = lcm{ g for each edge incident to u }\n\n        Then, x_u must be divisible by LCM_g[u].\n\n        Now, for an edge (u, v) with gcd=g and lcm=l, we have:\n\n          x_u = LCM_g[u] * a, x_v = LCM_g[v] * b.\n\n          But then, the product condition: x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\n          And the gcd condition: gcd(x_u, x_v) = g.\n\n          We can try to set:\n\n          Let g0 = gcd(LCM_g[u], LCM_g[v]). Then, we can write LCM_g[u] = g0 * a0, LCM_g[v] = g0 * b0, with gcd(a0, b0)=1.\n\n          Then, x_u = g0 * a0 * a, x_v = g0 * b0 * b.\n\n          Then, gcd(x_u, x_v) = g0 * gcd(a0*a, b0*b) = g0 * 1 = g0. But we require gcd(x_u, x_v) = g.\n\n          So g0 must equal g.\n\n        Therefore, we require that the gcd of LCM_g[u] and LCM_g[v] is g.\n\n        This is a very strong condition.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. For each node u, compute LCM_g[u] = lcm of all g for edges incident to u. (If there are no edges, then we can set LCM_g[u]=1.)\n\n          2. For each edge (u, v) with gcd=g and lcm=l:\n                a. Check that g divides l.\n                b. Check that the gcd(LCM_g[u], LCM_g[v]) == g.\n                c. Check that there exist a divisor d of l//g such that d divides LCM_g[u] and l//g // d divides LCM_g[v] and gcd(d, l//g//d)==1? Actually, we have:\n\n                    We require: x_u = LCM_g[u] * a, x_v = LCM_g[v] * b, and the product condition: x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\n                    But also, from the edge condition, we have x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\n                    And note: LCM_g[u] must divide x_u, and LCM_g[v] must divide x_v.\n\n                    Then, we can write: \n                         x_u = LCM_g[u] * a, x_v = LCM_g[v] * b, and then LCM_g[u]*LCM_g[v] * a * b = g * l.\n\n                    But we also know that gcd(LCM_g[u], LCM_g[v]) = g.\n\n                    Let L = LCM_g[u] * LCM_g[v] // g   [since gcd(LCM_g[u], LCM_g[v]) = g, then LCM_g[u] * LCM_g[v] = g * (LCM_g[u]//g * LCM_g[v]//g) * (g) ???]\n\n                    Actually, LCM_g[u] = g * a0, LCM_g[v] = g * b0, with gcd(a0, b0)=1.\n\n                    Then, x_u = g * a0 * a, x_v = g * b0 * b.\n\n                    Then, the product: x_u * x_v = g^2 * a0 * b0 * a * b = g * l.\n\n                    So, g * a0 * b0 * a * b = l.\n\n                    But a0 * b0 is fixed (from the node's incident edges) and must divide l. \n\n                    And then, a * b = (l) / (g * a0 * b0).\n\n                    And we require that gcd(a, b)=1.\n\n                    But note: the value a must be chosen such that x_u = g * a0 * a is divisible by LCM_g[u] (which is g*a0) -> yes, because a is an integer.\n\n                    And similarly for b.\n\n                    So the only additional condition for the edge is that (l) / (g * a0 * b0) is an integer and can be expressed as a product of two coprime integers a and b.\n\n                    But note: the entire expression is: \n                         a * b = l // (g * a0 * b0)\n\n                    And since a0 and b0 are coprime, and g is the gcd(LCM_g[u], LCM_g[v]), then g * a0 * b0 = LCM_g[u] * LCM_g[v] // something? Actually, we have:\n\n                         LCM_g[u] = g * a0, LCM_g[v] = g * b0, and since gcd(a0, b0)=1, then LCM_g[u] * LCM_g[v] = g^2 * a0 * b0.\n\n                    So, a * b = l // (g^2 * a0 * b0) * g = l // (g * a0 * b0)   [Wait, I see: from above, we have: g * a0 * b0 * a * b = l, so a*b = l // (g * a0 * b0)].\n\n                    But note: g * a0 * b0 = (LCM_g[u] * LCM_g[v]) // g   [because LCM_g[u] = g*a0, LCM_g[v]=g*b0, so product = g^2 * a0*b0, then divided by g is g * a0*b0].\n\n                    So, a*b = l // (g * a0 * b0) = l // ( (LCM_g[u] * LCM_g[v]) // g ) = (l * g) / (LCM_g[u] * LCM_g[v])\n\n                    But we also know that for the edge, the product x_u * x_v = g * l, and x_u = LCM_g[u] * a = g*a0*a, x_v = LCM_g[v] * b = g*b0*b, so indeed:\n\n                         (g*a0*a) * (g*b0*b) = g^2 * a0*b0*a*b = g * l   => a0*b0*a*b = l/g.\n\n                    But wait, we already know that the edge condition requires that l/g is an integer (from step 1a) and then a0*b0*a*b = l/g.\n\n                    And we have a0*b0 = (LCM_g[u] * LCM_g[v]) / (g^2)   [because LCM_g[u] = g*a0, LCM_g[v]=g*b0 -> a0 = LCM_g[u]/g, b0 = LCM_g[v]/g, and a0*b0 = (LCM_g[u]*LCM_g[v]) / g^2].\n\n                    Then, a*b = (l/g) / (a0*b0) = (l/g) / ( (LCM_g[u]*LCM_g[v]) / g^2 ) = (l * g) / (LCM_g[u]*LCM_g[v])\n\n                    So, the product a*b is fixed.\n\n                    And we require that a and b are coprime.\n\n                    But note: the entire system is defined by the node's LCM_g values and the edge's g and l.\n\n          Given the complexity, it",
