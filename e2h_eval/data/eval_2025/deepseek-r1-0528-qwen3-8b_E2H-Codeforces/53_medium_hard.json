    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (and they can overlap).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates.\n 2. Since the string length is at most 100, we can do an O(n^3) solution by checking each substring.\n\n However, we can be smarter: \n We can iterate over possible lengths from the maximum (n-1) down to 1, and for each length, check if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and occurrences can overlap.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a dictionary to record every substring and its starting index, but then we have to check for non-overlapping? Actually, the problem allows overlapping, so two occurrences can share some letters.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice\". So we are looking for the same substring (same consecutive sequence) appearing at least twice (and they can overlap). \n\n Example: 'ababa' -> the substring 'aba' appears starting at index0 and index2.\n\n Approach:\n Let n = len(s)\n We can try from the largest possible duplicate substring (which would be as long as n//2, but actually we can go up to n-1, but if we have two same substrings of length L, then we need at least 2*L <= n? Actually no, because they can overlap. For example, in 'aaa', we can have two 'aa' overlapping: one starting at 0 and one at 1.\n\n Actually, the maximum length of a substring that can appear at least twice is floor((n+1)/2) ? Not exactly. Consider 'abcabcabc' - but our n is at most 100.\n\n However, we don't know the pattern. So we can:\n\n Idea 1: for each substring, record it and check if we've seen it before. Then we want the maximum length of substring that has at least two occurrences.\n\n But note: we are asked for the length, not the substring.\n\n We can do:\n   seen = {}  # key: substring, value: set of starting indices (or just count, but we need to know the length and also ensure we have two distinct occurrences, but if the same substring appears at the same index twice? Actually, a substring is defined by consecutive characters, so same substring at same index is one occurrence. But we are only concerned with two distinct starting positions.\n\n However, we can do:\n\n   Let s = input string.\n   Let n = len(s)\n\n   We want to find the maximum L such that there exists a substring t of length L that appears at least twice (i.e., at two different starting indices).\n\n   We can iterate L from min(n, ...) down to 1, and for each L, check all contiguous substrings of length L and see if any substring appears at least twice.\n\n   How to check for a given L?\n        Create a dictionary for this L: mapping substring -> list of starting indices (or just count, but we don't care about the exact indices, just if we have at least two)\n        Or we can use a set for each substring, but we are iterating L.\n\n   But note: the total number of substrings for a fixed L is (n - L + 1). And L goes from 1 to n.\n\n   The worst-case total operations: sum_{L=1}^{n} (n-L+1) * L = O(n^3). Since n<=100, the worst-case is about 100^3/2 which is 500000, which is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can break early: we start from the largest L and go downwards until we find one that has at least two occurrences. Then we output L.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     n = len(s)\n     for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n        seen_substrings = {}\n        for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen_substrings:\n                # We already saw this substring at a different starting index (since i != the previous index)\n                print(L)\n                exit(0)  # or break out and return L\n            else:\n                seen_substrings[substr] = True   # or just record that we've seen it, but we don't need the indices\n\n        # If we finish the inner loop without finding a duplicate for this L, continue to the next smaller L.\n\n     If we don't find any duplicate, then we output 0.\n\n   But wait: what if we have two identical substrings that are the same but at different indices? This method will catch the first duplicate.\n\n   However, note: we are storing the substring itself. So if the same substring appears again, we catch it.\n\n   But note: what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the second occurrence.\n\n   Example: s = 'aaaa'\n        L=4: 'aaaa' -> no duplicate because we haven't seen it before (we are processing from left to right, and we store the first occurrence, then when we see the same substring again (if any) we break)\n        Actually, for L=4: we have only one substring: 'aaaa'. So no duplicate.\n        Then L=3: substrings: 'aaa' (from index0), then 'aaa' (from index1) -> duplicate found, so output 3.\n\n   However, the problem says: the substring must appear at least twice. In 'aaaa', the substring 'aaa' appears at index0 and index1, so two times.\n\n   But wait: the sample test: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> outputs [0,3,2]\n\n   Example 1: 'abcd' -> no duplicate substring, so output 0.\n   Example 2: 'ababa' -> the substring 'aba' appears at index0 and index2, so length 3. Also, the substring 'ab' appears at index0 and index2? \n        Actually, let's check: \n          'ababa': \n            length 5: no duplicate (only one substring)\n            length 4: substrings: 'abab', 'baba' -> no duplicate\n            length 3: substrings: \n                'aba' (index0), 'bab' (index1), 'aba' (index2) -> duplicate 'aba'\n            so we output 3.\n\n   Example 3: 'zzz'\n        length 3: 'zzz' -> no duplicate (only one occurrence)\n        length 2: substrings: 'zz' (index0), 'zz' (index1) -> duplicate, so output 2.\n\n   This matches the sample.\n\n   However, note: the above algorithm does not require storing all the substrings for different L, we break as soon as we find a duplicate for the current L (starting from the largest L). \n\n   But note: we must check for the largest L first. Because we want the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n   However, there is one more consideration: what if a longer substring has a duplicate? Then we break at the larger L.\n\n   This is correct because we are going from large L to small L.\n\n   But wait: is it possible that a longer substring has a duplicate, but we didn't check it because we broke earlier? Actually, we break as soon as we find a duplicate at a given L. But we are iterating from large L to small L, so the first duplicate we find is the longest.\n\n   However, we must note: the same substring might appear multiple times, but we are only concerned with the length.\n\n   But what if there are two different substrings of the same length L that both appear at least twice? Then we break at the first one we find (but we don't need to know which one, we just need the length L).\n\n   So the plan is:\n\n        n = len(s)\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                else:\n                    seen.add(substr)\n\n        print(0)\n\n   However, wait: in the inner loop, we are adding the substring to the set. But if we see the same substring again, we break. But what if the same substring appears again later? We break at the second occurrence.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But note: what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the second time we see it.\n\n   However, the problem requires at least two, so two is enough.\n\n   But there is a catch: the same substring might appear non-consecutive? Actually, we are storing the substring and checking for duplicates. The order of checking doesn't matter because we are storing all we've seen so far.\n\n   But wait: we are iterating from the beginning. So if we have two same substrings, we break at the second occurrence.\n\n   Example: 'aabaac' and L=2: \n        i=0: 'aa' -> not seen, add.\n        i=1: 'ab' -> not seen, add.\n        i=2: 'ba' -> not seen, add.\n        i=3: 'aa' -> seen! -> break and output 2.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, there is an alternative: what if we have two same substrings but they are not consecutive? Our method still catches them.\n\n   But note: the set stores the substring and we don't care about the order.\n\n   But wait: we are iterating from the largest L downward. What if a substring of length L1 (larger) appears twice, then we break and never check a substring of the same length L1 that might also appear twice? \n\n   Actually, we are only concerned with the first duplicate we find for the current L. But we are iterating over all substrings of length L. We break as soon as we find one duplicate.\n\n   However, we want the longest L for which there is at least one substring that appears at least twice. \n\n   So if we find a duplicate for L, then we output L and exit.\n\n   But note: it is possible that for a given L, there are multiple substrings that are duplicates, but we break at the first duplicate we meet. That's okay because we just need to know that there is at least one.\n\n   However, the above code does not break the outer loop immediately when a duplicate is found? Actually, we break the inner loop and then we break the outer loop by exiting.\n\n   But wait, we break the inner loop and then we break the program. We don't check the rest of the substrings for the same L? Actually, we break the inner loop and then the outer loop by exiting.\n\n   But we should not exit immediately after the first duplicate in the inner loop? Actually, we can break the inner loop and then break the outer loop because we found the answer.\n\n   However, we are breaking the inner loop by using an exit(0). Alternatively, we can set a flag and break out.\n\n   But note: we are iterating from the largest L to the smallest. We break at the first L (the largest) for which we find a duplicate. That is what we want.\n\n   But wait: what if we have two different substrings of the same maximum length? Then we break at the first one we find. But we are scanning from left to right. The maximum L is fixed, and we break as soon as we find one duplicate. That is acceptable because the length is the same.\n\n   However, there is a potential issue: the same substring might appear twice, but we are storing the substring and comparing. \n\n   But what if the same substring appears twice in two different parts of the string, but we see the first occurrence and then the second occurrence is not adjacent? Our method works because we are storing all the substrings we've seen so far.\n\n   But wait: in the inner loop for a fixed L, we are storing every substring we've encountered. When we see a substring that is already in the set, we break.\n\n   Example: 'ababa' for L=3: \n        i=0: 'aba' -> not seen, add.\n        i=1: 'bab' -> not seen, add.\n        i=2: 'aba' -> seen, so break and output 3.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   But wait: what if the two duplicate substrings are not the same as the ones we are storing? Actually, we are storing the exact substring. \n\n   However, there is an edge case: empty string? The problem states the string is non-empty.\n\n   Another edge case: string of length 1? Then L goes from 1 to 1. There is only one substring of length 1. So no duplicate. Output 0.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the string is non-empty and consists of lower-case Latin letters. \n\n   Example: \"a\" -> output 0.\n\n   However, note: what if we have two same characters? e.g., \"aa\": \n        n=2\n        L=2: substring \"aa\" -> no duplicate (only one occurrence) -> then L=1: \n            i=0: substring \"a\" -> not seen, add.\n            i=1: substring \"a\" -> seen, so output 1.\n\n   But wait, the substring \"a\" appears twice (at index0 and index1). So the answer for \"aa\" should be 1.\n\n   However, the sample test: ['zzz'] -> output 2. So in \"zzz\": \n        L=3: \"zzz\" -> no duplicate (only one occurrence) -> L=2: \n            i=0: \"zz\" -> not seen, add.\n            i=1: \"zz\" -> seen, so output 2.\n\n   But wait: in \"aa\", the substring \"a\" is of length 1, and we output 1. But the problem says: the longest substring that appears at least twice. \n\n   However, note: the entire string \"aa\" is of length 2 and does not appear twice (it appears once). But the substring \"a\" (length 1) appears twice.\n\n   So the answer for \"aa\" is 1.\n\n   Now, consider \"aaa\": \n        L=3: \"aaa\" -> no duplicate -> L=2: \n            i=0: \"aa\" -> not seen, add.\n            i=1: \"aa\" -> seen, so output 2.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   But wait: in \"aaa\", the substring \"a\" (length 1) also appears three times. But we are checking from the largest L first. So we break at L=2, which is longer than 1. So we output 2.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string length is 0, but the problem says non-empty, so skip.\n\n        # We are going to iterate L from n down to 1.\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    exit(0)\n                else:\n                    seen.add(substr)\n\n        print(0)\n\n   But wait: what if we have a string like \"aabb\"? \n        We are looking for the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n        Substrings of length 4: \"aabb\" -> unique.\n        length 3: \"aab\", \"abb\" -> unique.\n        length 2: \"aa\", \"ab\", \"bb\" -> \n            \"aa\" is unique, \"ab\" is unique, \"bb\" is unique.\n        length 1: \"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"b\" -> \"a\" appears twice, \"b\" appears twice. So we break at L=1 and output 1.\n\n   However, is there a substring of length 2 that appears twice? In \"aabb\", the substring \"ab\" appears once, \"aa\" once, \"bb\" once. But note: the substring \"a\" and \"b\" are both repeated, but we break at the first duplicate we find for L=1. \n\n   But wait, we are iterating from L=4 down to 1. For L=1, we start at i=0: 'a' -> not seen, add.\n        i=1: 'a' -> seen -> output 1.\n\n   But is there a substring of length 1 that appears at least twice? Yes, so we output 1.\n\n   However, is there a longer substring that appears twice? No, so 1 is the answer.\n\n   But wait, consider: \"abab\"\n        length 4: \"abab\" -> unique.\n        length 3: \"aba\", \"bab\" -> unique.\n        length 2: \"ab\", \"ba\", \"ab\" -> \n            \"ab\" appears at index0 and index2 -> duplicate. So we break at L=2 and output 2.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above code uses exit(0) which terminates the program. We are reading from stdin and writing to stdout.\n\n   But the problem says: the first input line contains the string.\n\n   We assume the input is one string.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as a list: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] but that's just examples. The actual input is one string.\n\n   So we read:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n   However, the problem says: the first input line contains the string.\n\n   But wait: the example input format is shown as a list, but the problem says the first input line. So we assume one string per input.\n\n   But note: the sample input is provided as:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is just showing the examples. The actual input is:\n\n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" So there is only one string per run.\n\n   Therefore, we read one string.\n\n   However, the example output is a list: ['0','3','2'] meaning that the example has three test cases? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Input: The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   And the example shows:\n\n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   But wait, the problem statement might be showing multiple examples. However, the problem says: \"You're given a string\", singular.\n\n   Clarification: the input is one string. The example output is given for three different strings, but the program should read one string from stdin.\n\n   But the problem is presented as a competitive programming problem, so typically we read one test case.\n\n   However, the example input format is ambiguous. But the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So we assume one string per execution.\n\n   But wait: the example output is shown as a list of three numbers. This might be because the problem intended to show multiple examples, but the input is one string.\n\n   Actually, looking at the example:\n\n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   This suggests that the problem expects to process multiple test cases? But the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   Let me re-read: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then \"Input: The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   But wait, the example input is given as a list of strings. This is confusing.\n\n   After checking the problem statement again: it says \"Input\" and then lists three examples. However, the problem says the input is one string.\n\n   I think the example is showing three separate examples. The problem does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   So we assume one test case per run.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"competitive programming problem\", and sometimes they have multiple test cases.\n\n   However, the input description says \"The first input line contains the string.\" and the string length is at most 100.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n   But the example output is given as a list of three numbers. This might be a formatting issue.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be providing multiple test cases in one run? \n\n   Let me read the problem statement again: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So we read one string.\n\n   But wait, the example input is written as:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This might be a typo. Actually, in many problems, the input is one string per test case, and there are multiple test cases. But the problem statement does not specify.\n\n   However, the constraints say: \"the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100\".\n\n   And the example output is three numbers. \n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output: Output one number\".\n\n   So each test case produces one number.\n\n   Now, if the problem intended to have multiple test cases, then we would need to read until EOF. But the problem says the first input line contains the string.\n\n   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, but the sample test is given as a list of three strings, and the output is a list of three numbers, I suspect that the problem actually expects multiple test cases.\n\n   However, the problem says \"The first input line contains the string\", so one string.\n\n   But wait, the example input format is shown as:\n\n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is confusing. It might be that the problem intended to say that there are multiple test cases, each on its own line.\n\n   But the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\"\n\n   So if we are to process multiple test cases, then the input would be:\n\n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   with each test case on a separate line.\n\n   But the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning the very first line. Then subsequent lines? \n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be giving a list of strings as input. But the problem says \"the first input line\", so the entire input is one string.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: it says \"Input: The first input line contains the string.\" and then the example is given as a list.\n\n   This is inconsistent.\n\n   I think there is a misunderstanding. The problem is from a competition, and in many competitions, the input is one string per test case, and there can be multiple test cases. But the problem statement here is ambiguous.\n\n   However, note the example output: ['0','3','2'].\n\n   Since the problem says \"Output one number\", and if there are three test cases, then we would output three numbers.\n\n   But the problem statement says \"Output one number\", meaning one number per test case.\n\n   So if we are to process multiple test cases, we would read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem says \"The first input line contains the string\", which implies that the entire input is one string.\n\n   After checking the sample tests, I see the problem statement says:\n\n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   This suggests that the input is three strings, one per line.\n\n   How did the problem statement present it? As a list. But in reality, the input is three lines.\n\n   Clarification: the problem says \"The first input line\", meaning the first line is the first string, the second line is the second string, etc.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" and then the example input is given as a list of three strings. \n\n   This is ambiguous.\n\n   However, the problem's example output is three numbers. So we must output three numbers for three inputs.\n\n   Therefore, the problem likely expects multiple test cases, each string on a separate line.\n\n   But the problem statement says \"The first input line\", implying that the input is one string.\n\n   Let me check the original problem statement link? But we don't have a link.\n\n   Since this is a text-based problem and we are to write a script, and the sample input is given as a list, we must decide.\n\n   However, the problem constraints say the string is non-empty and length <= 100.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I will assume the input is one string per line, and there can be multiple test cases (until EOF). But the problem statement says \"The first input line\", so perhaps it's one test case.\n\n   But the example input is three strings, so three test cases.\n\n   How should we handle?\n\n   Option 1: Read until EOF, and for each string, output the answer.\n\n   Option 2: Read one string and output one answer.\n\n   The problem says: \"The first input line\", so if there is only one line, then one test case.\n\n   But the example input is three lines. \n\n   Since the problem statement says \"Input: The first input line contains the string\", and then the example input is given as a list, it is likely that the example input is meant to be one string, but they showed multiple examples.\n\n   However, the output is also shown as a list.\n\n   I think the intended input format is one string per test case, and the test cases are separated by newlines. We should read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   Given the confusion, I will follow the sample: the sample input is three strings, so we assume multiple test cases.\n\n   Steps for multiple test cases:\n\n        while True:\n            try:\n                s = input().strip()\n                # process s and output the answer for s\n            except EOFError:\n                break\n\n   But the problem says \"The first input line\", so if we are reading multiple lines, then the first line is the first string.\n\n   However, the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases, but the example input is three strings.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have provided the sample input as a single string that contains commas? But the example input is given as a list.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input/output examples.\n\n   The example input is:\n\n        ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n   This is likely just a way to show the examples. The actual input is:\n\n        abcd\n        ababa\n        zzz\n\n   So three test cases, one per line.\n\n   Therefore, we read until EOF.\n\n   But the problem statement says \"The first input line\", so we are reading multiple lines.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Output one number\", meaning for each test case, one number.\n\n   So we output one number per test case.\n\n   Revised plan:\n\n        We read lines until EOF.\n        For each line, we strip to get the string.\n\n        Then apply the algorithm above.\n\n   But note: the problem says the string is non-empty and consists of lower-case Latin letters, and the length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n   We assume each test case is one string.\n\n   Code for multiple test cases:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        for line in data:\n            s = line.strip()\n            if s == '': \n                # skip empty lines, but the problem says non-empty string, so we assume no empty lines.\n                continue\n            n = len(s)\n            # Apply the algorithm for one string s\n\n        But the problem says the first input line, so we can also use:\n\n        while True:\n            s = input().strip()\n            if s == '':\n                break\n            # process s\n\n   However, the problem does not specify that there is an empty line to signal the end. It says the string is non-empty.\n\n   But we can read until EOF.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem may have exactly one test case.\n\n   Given the sample input has three test cases, we assume multiple.\n\n   But wait, the problem statement says: \"The first input line contains the string.\" \n\n   This implies one string. \n\n   However, the example input is three strings. \n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   After thinking: the problem statement might be from a source that intended to have one test case, but the example was copied incorrectly.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Input: The first input line contains the string.\" and then the example input is a list of three strings.\n\n   I think the intended input is one string, but the example input is showing three different examples.\n\n   How should we proceed?\n\n   Let me look at the problem statement again: it says \"Input: The first input line contains the string.\" and then \"Output: Output one number\".\n\n   Then the example input is given as a list: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and the example output is a list: ['0','3','2'].\n\n   This suggests that the problem expects one test case, but the example input is three test cases.\n\n   But wait, the example input is not the actual input. The example input is just to illustrate.\n\n   Since the problem says \"The first input line\", we assume one test case.\n\n   But the sample output is three numbers, which would be for three test cases.\n\n   This is very confusing.\n\n   I decide to clarify with the user or the problem setter, but since I cannot, I will assume the input is one string.\n\n   However, the problem says \"competitive programming\", and many competitive programming problems have multiple test cases.\n\n   But the problem statement does not specify multiple test cases.\n\n   After re‐reading the problem statement: it says \"You're given a string.\" (singular) and then the input format is one string.\n\n   Therefore, we assume one test case.\n\n   But the example input is given as a list of three strings. \n\n   I think the example input is just illustrative. The actual input is one string.\n\n   However, the sample output is three numbers. \n\n   This is inconsistent.\n\n   Let me re‐examine the sample: \n\n        Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n        Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\n   This means that if the input is the string 'abcd', output '0'; if the input is 'ababa', output '3'; if the input is 'zzz', output '2'.\n\n   So the example input is three separate test cases.\n\n   Therefore, the problem expects multiple test cases.\n\n   But the problem statement says \"The first input line\", which could mean that the first line is the first test case, and then the next line is the second, etc.\n\n   Conclusion: we read until EOF, and for each non-empty line, we process the string.\n\n   However, the problem statement says \"The first input line\", which might imply that the entire input is one line. But the example input is three lines.\n\n   I think the problem statement is poorly worded.\n\n   Since the sample input is three test cases, we assume multiple test cases.\n\n   We change the code to read until EOF.\n\n   But wait, the problem says the string is non-empty, so we don't have to worry about empty strings.\n\n   Code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        for line in data:\n            s = line.strip()\n            if s == '':\n                continue\n            n = len(s)\n            # Algorithm for one string s\n\n   But the problem says the first input line contains the string. If there are multiple lines, then the first line is the first string, and then the next line is the next string.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   However, the problem statement says \"The first input line\", so if there is only one test case, then we read the first line and stop.\n\n   But the example input has three lines, so we read three lines.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        for s in sys.stdin:\n            s = s.strip()\n            if s == '':\n                continue\n            # process s\n\n   But the problem says the first input line, so we are reading all lines until EOF.\n\n   Since the problem statement is ambiguous, and the sample input has three lines, we assume multiple test cases.\n\n   But wait, the problem statement says \"The first input line\", which might be interpreted as the entire input is one line. However, the example input is three lines.\n\n   I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n   Since the sample input is three lines, and the expected output is three numbers, we output one number per line.\n\n   Therefore, we output the answer for each test case on a separate line.\n\n   However, the problem says \"Output one number\", so for each test case, one number.\n\n   But if we have three test cases, we output three numbers, each on a separate line? Or space separated? The problem says \"Output one number\", so for one test case one number.\n\n   The example output is given as a list: ['0','3','2'].\n\n   But the problem does not specify the output format for multiple test cases.\n\n   Typically, in competitive programming, if there are multiple test cases, we output the answer for each test case on a separate line.\n\n   So we output one number per test case, one per line.\n\n   But the example output is shown as a list, which might be just for convenience.\n\n   Therefore, we modify the code to read all test cases and output the answer for each test case.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        import sys\n\n        def main():\n            data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n            for line in data:\n                s = line.strip()\n                if s == '':\n                    continue\n                n = len(s)\n                # We'll iterate L from n down to 1\n                found_duplicate = False\n                for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n                    seen = set()\n                    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                        substr = s[i:i+L]\n                        if substr in seen:\n                            print(L)\n                            found_duplicate = True\n                            break\n                        else:\n                            seen.add(substr)\n                    if found_duplicate:\n                        break\n                if not found_duplicate:\n                    print(0)\n\n        if __name__ == '__main__':\n            main()\n\n   However, we can break the outer loop as well.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    return   # if we are in a function, but we are not in a function for the whole program.\n\n   But we are reading multiple test cases, so we cannot return.\n\n   We can structure the code to not use exit(0) but break out of the loops and then continue to the next test case.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        for line in data:\n            s = line.strip()\n            if s == '':\n                continue\n            n = len(s)\n            ans = 0\n            for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n                seen = set()\n                found = False\n                for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                    substr = s[i:i+L]\n                    if substr in seen:\n                        ans = L\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        seen.add(substr)\n                if found:\n                    break\n            print(ans)\n\n   But note: we want to break at the first L (largest) we find a duplicate.\n\n   This code sets ans to L and breaks the outer loop, then prints ans.\n\n   But what if no duplicate is found? Then ans remains 0, and we print 0.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   Let me test with \"abcd\": \n        n=4, L from 4 down to 1.\n        L=4: no duplicate -> set ans=0 and go to next L.\n        L=3: no duplicate.\n        L=2: no duplicate.\n        L=1: no duplicate -> then print 0.\n\n   With \"ababa\": \n        L=5: no duplicate.\n        L=4: no duplicate.\n        L=3: at i=2, we see 'aba' again -> set ans=3, break.\n\n   With \"zzz\":\n        L=3: no duplicate.\n        L=2: at i=1, we see 'zz' again -> set ans=2, break.\n\n   But wait, in the above code, we break the inner loop and then break the outer loop by finishing the if found.\n\n   However, the code does not break the outer loop explicitly, but we break the inner loop and then check found, and then break the outer loop by continuing to the next test case.\n\n   But note: the outer loop is broken by the 'break' inside the if found, which breaks the innermost loop (the for i loop). Then we check if found and break the outer for L loop? Actually, no.\n\n   The code above does not break the outer loop. We break the inner loop, then check if found, then break the outer loop? \n\n   Actually, no: the break in the inner loop only breaks the inner for loop. Then we check if found is True, and then break the outer for loop (the L loop). \n\n   But wait, the code does not have a break for the outer loop. Let me see:\n\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                ...\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    found = True\n                    break   # breaks the inner loop\n            if found:\n                break   # breaks the outer loop\n\n   Yes, we break the outer loop.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    ans = L\n                    break_outer = True\n                   ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution should efficiently handle all edge cases.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters (substring) that repeats at least once in the input string. The solution must consider overlapping occurrences, meaning substrings can share some characters.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the input string, starting from the longest possible down to the shortest, to find the first occurrence of a duplicate substring. This approach ensures that the first duplicate found will be the longest possible substring meeting the criteria.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a nested loop structure where the outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1. For each length, the inner loop checks all substrings of that length, using a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, its length is recorded, and the search terminates early.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm's worst-case time complexity is O(n^3), where n is the length of the string. This is because for each possible substring length (O(n)), we check up to O(n) substrings, each of length O(n). Given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is feasible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in data:\n        s = line.strip()\n        if s == '':\n            continue\n        n = len(s)\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    ans = L\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input lines from standard input. Each line is processed as a separate test case.\n2. **Processing Each String**: For each non-empty string, the algorithm initializes the answer to 0, indicating no duplicate substring was found initially.\n3. **Checking Substrings**: The outer loop starts from the longest possible substring length (n-1) and decrements down to 1. For each length, the inner loop checks every possible substring of that length.\n4. **Tracking Seen Substrings**: A set is used to keep track of substrings encountered during the current length iteration. If a substring is found in the set, it means the substring has appeared before, and its length is recorded as the answer.\n5. **Early Termination**: Once the longest valid substring length is found, the program breaks out of the loops and proceeds to the next test case, ensuring efficiency.\n6. **Output**: The result for each test case is printed, which is the length of the longest repeating substring or 0 if no such substring exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the solution by leveraging early termination and set operations to track duplicates, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
