    "thought": "\n We are given an integer n and then a list of n integers.\n We have to remove exactly one element and minimize the instability (which is max - min).\n\n Observation:\n The instability of the entire array is (max - min). When we remove one element, the new instability will be:\n   max_new = max without that element, and min_new = min without that element.\n\n However, note that if we remove an element, the new min might be higher than the original min, and the new max might be lower than the original max.\n\n The key idea: \n Since the instability is determined by the max and min, we can consider removing either the current minimum or the current maximum.\n\n But note: sometimes removing an element that is not the extreme might lead to a better instability? Actually, let's think:\n\n The overall instability after removal is (new_max - new_min). The new_max is at most the original max (if we don't remove the max) and similarly the new_min is at least the original min (if we don't remove the min). However, if we remove an element that is not the min or the max, then the min and max remain the same. Therefore, the instability remains the same as the original.\n\n So, the only chance to reduce the instability is to remove one of the extremes (min or max). \n\n Then, what are the candidates?\n  Candidate 1: Remove the smallest element -> then the new min is the next smallest (the second smallest) and the max remains the same (unless there are multiple mins, but then even if we remove one min, the next smallest might still be the same as the original min? Actually, no: we have to consider duplicates.\n\n Actually, we can do:\n\n Let the sorted array be b.\n\n Option 1: Remove the first occurrence (smallest) -> then the new array has min = b[1] (if exists) and max = b[n-1] (if we don't remove the last element). But note: the array may have duplicate values.\n\n However, note: if we remove one element, the min and max are recalculated from the remaining array.\n\n We can consider two cases:\n   Case 1: Remove the smallest element (b[0])\n        Then the new min is b[1] (if n>=2) and the max is b[-1] (unless the smallest element is also the largest? but no, because if we remove one occurrence, the array still has the largest element unless we removed the largest too, but in this case we are removing the smallest).\n\n        So instability becomes: b[-1] - b[1]\n\n   Case 2: Remove the largest element (b[-1])\n        Then the new min is b[0] and the new max is b[-2] (if n>=2)\n        Instability becomes: b[-2] - b[0]\n\n But wait, what if the array has duplicate minima or maxima?\n\n Example: [1,1,3,7]\n   Removing one of the 1's: \n        If we remove the first 1: [1,3,7] -> min=1, max=7 -> instability=6.\n        But if we remove the second 1: [1,3,7] -> same.\n\n However, note: the problem doesn't specify distinct elements.\n\n Actually, we must consider that the array can have duplicates.\n\n But note: the instability is defined by the max and min of the entire remaining array.\n\n Alternate approach: \n   Since the entire array is sorted, we can consider every candidate removal of an element and compute the instability. However, n can be up to 10^5 so we cannot check each removal (n possibilities) and for each do an O(n) scan (which would be O(n^2)).\n\n Insight:\n The instability after removing an element x is:\n   Let M = max(original array), m = min(original array).\n   If x is the only occurrence of M, then the new max is the next largest value (the largest value less than M) but if there are multiple Ms, then the new max is still M (if at least one M remains). Similarly for m.\n\n Actually, we can consider:\n\n   Let the sorted array be b.\n\n   Consider removing an element at index i (0-indexed). Then the new min is:\n        If b[i] == b[0] and there is no other b[0] (i.e., the frequency of b[0] is 1) then the new min is b[1]. Otherwise, if there are multiple b[0], then the new min is still b[0] (because we only remove one occurrence).\n\n   Similarly, the new max is:\n        If b[i] == b[-1] and the frequency of b[-1] is 1, then the new max is b[-2]. Otherwise, it remains b[-1].\n\n However, we can simplify:\n\n   The instability after removing an element at index i is:\n        instability_i = max(remaining) - min(remaining)\n\n   But note: the remaining array is the entire array without the element at i.\n\n   But note: the entire array is sorted. The remaining array's min and max are:\n\n        min_remaining = \n            if b[i] == b[0]:\n                then we need the smallest element that is >= b[0] and not necessarily b[0]. However, if there are duplicates, then the next smallest might be b[0] (if there are multiple b[0]) or b[1] (if we remove the only b[0]).\n\n   Actually, we can precompute:\n\n        Let left_min[i] = the minimum value in the subarray from 0 to i (but that doesn't help directly)\n\n   Alternatively, note that the min of the entire array without the element at i is:\n        If we remove an element that is the minimum, then the new min is the next minimum (which is the minimum of the rest). But we can use:\n\n        min_after_removal = \n            if b[i] == b[0]:\n                then if there is any other element equal to b[0] (i.e., if i < n-1 and b[i+1] == b[0] OR if the count of b[0] is more than 1) then the min_after_removal is still b[0].\n                Otherwise, min_after_removal = b[1] (if i==0 and the next is different).\n\n   Similarly for max.\n\n   However, we don't want to iterate over each element (n can be 10^5) and for each do an O(n) operation.\n\n Another Insight:\n\n   The instability of the array without one element is determined by the min and max of the remaining array.\n\n   Notice that the min of the remaining array is at least the original min, and the max is at most the original max.\n\n   Also, the instability is (max_remaining - min_remaining).\n\n   We can consider:\n\n        Option 1: Remove an element that is the global min. Then the new min is the next smallest (which is the second distinct smallest, but note: there might be duplicates).\n\n        However, note: we are allowed to remove any element. But the goal is to minimize the instability.\n\n   What is the best way?\n\n   Consider: The overall instability of the original array is M - m.\n\n   After removing one element, the instability can be:\n\n        Option A: Remove an element that is not the min and not the max -> then the min and max remain the same -> instability = M - m.\n\n        Option B: Remove the min -> then the new min is the next smallest, so the instability becomes M - (next smallest) [if we remove the min, then the next smallest is the smallest that is not the removed min]\n\n        Option C: Remove the max -> then the new max is the next largest, so the instability becomes (next largest) - m.\n\n        Option D: Remove an element that is both min and max? Actually, if the array has only one distinct value, then removing any element leaves the same value, so instability becomes 0.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is the minimum among:\n\n        Option B: M - (the smallest value that is not the min)   [if we remove the min and there is a next smallest distinct value]\n        Option C: (the largest value that is not the max) - m     [if we remove the max and there is a next largest distinct value]\n        Option E: The original instability (if we remove an element that is neither min nor max) but that is the same as original, so we don't need to consider if we can get lower.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to remove any element. So we have to consider all possibilities? But note: if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, then the min and max remain the same. Therefore, the instability remains the same as the original.\n\n   So the minimal instability we can achieve is the minimum between:\n\n        Option B: M - (the next distinct min)   [if we remove the min, then the new min is the next distinct min, which is the smallest value that is not the original min? Actually, no: if there are duplicates, then even if we remove one min, the min might still be the original min. So we have to consider:\n\n        Actually, the next min after removing one occurrence of the min is:\n\n            If the frequency of the min is more than 1, then the min remains the same (min is still the original min). Then the instability is M - min (same as original).\n\n            If the frequency of the min is 1, then the new min is the next distinct value (which is the smallest value that is greater than the min).\n\n        Similarly, for the max.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        Sort the array.\n\n        Let m = b[0], M = b[-1]\n\n        Count the frequency of m and M? Actually, we can use:\n\n        If we remove the min and the min appears only once, then the new min is the next distinct value (which is the first element that is not m). But note: the array is sorted, so the next distinct value is the first element that is greater than m. However, if we remove one occurrence of m, then the new min is the minimum of the remaining array, which is the smallest element that is at least m. But since we removed one m, if there is another m then the min remains m.\n\n        Therefore, the instability when removing the min is:\n\n            If the first occurrence of m is at index i and there is another m (i.e., the array has at least two m's), then the new min is m (so instability = M - m, same as original).\n\n            Else (only one m): then the new min is b[1] (the next element) and the instability is M - b[1].\n\n        Similarly, for the max:\n\n            If the last occurrence of M is at index j and there is another M (so the array has at least two M's), then the new max is M (so instability = M - m, same as original).\n\n            Else (only one M): then the new max is b[-2] and the instability is b[-2] - m.\n\n        But wait, what if we remove an element that is neither the min nor the max? Then the min and max remain the same, so the instability is M - m.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability we can get is:\n\n            candidate1 = M - m   [if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, or if removing the min or max doesn't change the min or max]\n\n            candidate2 = (M - b[1]) if (the frequency of m is 1) else (M - m)   [from removing the min]\n            candidate3 = (b[-2] - m) if (the frequency of M is 1) else (M - m)   [from removing the max]\n\n        Then the answer is the minimum of candidate1, candidate2, candidate3.\n\n        However, note: candidate1 is the original, and candidate2 and candidate3 are improvements only if they are less than candidate1.\n\n        But wait, if we remove the min and the min appears only once, then candidate2 = M - b[1] which is definitely <= M - m (since b[1] >= m, and actually b[1] > m because if there was another m then we wouldn't be in this branch). Similarly, candidate3 = b[-2]-m <= M-m.\n\n        However, we must consider that the original instability (candidate1) is the same as candidate2 and candidate3 in the case of duplicates. But note: if we remove the min and there are duplicates, then the instability remains M-m, which is the same as candidate1. Similarly for the max.\n\n        So the answer is the minimum among:\n\n            candidate2 = (if the min appears only once) then M - b[1] else M-m\n            candidate3 = (if the max appears only once) then b[-2]-m else M-m\n\n        And we know that if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, we get M-m. But note: we are allowed to choose any removal. So we can choose the removal that gives the minimum of these three.\n\n        However, note: we don't have to consider the original M-m separately because:\n\n            candidate2 and candidate3 are either M-m (if duplicates) or smaller (if unique). \n\n        So the minimal instability is the minimum between candidate2 and candidate3.\n\n        But wait, what if the array has more than two distinct values? \n\n        Example: [1,3,4,5] (n=4)\n\n        Original instability: 5-1=4.\n\n        Removing the min (1): then the array becomes [3,4,5] -> instability=5-3=2.\n        Removing the max (5): then the array becomes [1,3,4] -> instability=4-1=3.\n\n        candidate2 = 5 - 3 = 2 (since min appears only once)\n        candidate3 = 4 - 1 = 3 (since max appears only once)\n\n        Then the answer is 2.\n\n        Another example: [1,2,3,4] (n=4)\n\n        Removing the min (1): [2,3,4] -> instability=4-2=2.\n        Removing the max (4): [1,2,3] -> instability=3-1=2.\n\n        Now, if we remove the min: candidate2 = 4-2=2.\n        candidate3 = 3-1=2.\n\n        But note: the original array has duplicates? No, so we consider candidate2 and candidate3.\n\n        However, wait: what if we remove an element in the middle? Then the instability is 4-1=3, which is worse.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n        But note: the above method does not consider removing an element that is not the min or the max. However, the problem requires removing exactly one element. We are only considering the removals that are the min and the max. Why is that sufficient?\n\n        Because the min and max of the remaining array can only be improved by removing one of the extremes. Removing an interior element doesn't change the min or max, so the instability remains the same as the original.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n            candidate2 = (if the first element is unique) then (last element - second element) else (original instability)\n            candidate3 = (if the last element is unique) then (second last element - first element) else (original instability)\n\n        But wait: what if the array has more than two distinct values and we remove an element that is the min but there are multiple mins? Then candidate2 becomes the original instability. Similarly for candidate3.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            Let b = sorted(a)\n\n            original_instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n\n            # Check uniqueness of the min and max.\n\n            # For the min: \n            if b[0] != b[1]:\n                candidate_min_removed = original_instability - (b[0] - b[1])   # Wait, no: if we remove the min, then the new max is still the original max, and the new min is b[1]. So the instability is b[-1] - b[1].\n                # But wait, that is not the same as subtracting (b[0]-b[1]) from original_instability (which is b[-1]-b[0]).\n                # Actually: original_instability = b[-1] - b[0]\n                # candidate_min_removed = b[-1] - b[1] = (b[-1] - b[0]) - (b[1] - b[0])? Not exactly.\n\n            Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n            candidate_min_removed = b[-1] - (b[0] if there are duplicates of the min else b[1])\n\n            But wait, if there are duplicates, then the new min is still b[0], so candidate_min_removed = b[-1] - b[0] (same as original).\n\n            Similarly, candidate_max_removed = (b[-1] if there are duplicates of the max else b[-2]) - b[0]\n\n            However, how do we check duplicates?\n\n            We can check the first two and the last two:\n\n            candidate_min_removed = b[-1] - (b[1] if b[0] != b[1] else b[0])\n            candidate_max_removed = (b[-2] if b[-1] != b[-2] else b[-1]) - b[0]\n\n            But wait, is that always correct?\n\n            Example: [1,1,3,7] -> remove one of the 1's: the min remains 1, so instability = 7-1=6 (same as original). Using our formula: \n                candidate_min_removed = 7 - (if b[0]!=b[1]? b[0]==b[1] so use b[0]) -> 7-1=6.\n\n            Example: [1,3,3,7] -> remove the min (1): then min becomes 3, so instability=7-3=4. \n                Our formula: candidate_min_removed = 7 - (b[0]!=b[1] -> True, so use b[1]=3) -> 7-3=4.\n\n            Example: [1,3,7,7] -> remove the max (7): then max becomes 3? Actually, no: the array becomes [1,3,7] -> max=7? Wait, because there are two 7's. So the max remains 7. Then instability=7-1=6 (same as original). \n                Our formula for candidate_max_removed: \n                    We look at the last two: b[-1]==b[-2] -> yes, so use b[-1] (which is 7) then 7-1=6.\n\n            So the formulas are:\n\n                candidate_min_removed = b[-1] - (b[1] if b[0] != b[1] else b[0])\n                candidate_max_removed = (b[-2] if b[-1] != b[-2] else b[-1]) - b[0]\n\n            However, note: what if the array has length 2? Then b[1] exists (for candidate_min_removed) and b[-2] exists (for candidate_max_removed). \n\n            Example: n=2, [1,10] -> \n                candidate_min_removed = 10 - (if 1!=10 then use 10? no: condition is b[0]!=b[1] -> 1!=10 -> True, so use b[1]=10) -> 10-10=0.\n                candidate_max_removed = (b[-2]=1 if 10!=1 then use 1) - 1 = 0.\n\n            But wait, if we remove the min (1) from [1,10]: then the array becomes [10] -> instability=10-10=0.\n            Similarly, remove the max (10) becomes [1] -> instability=0.\n\n            That matches.\n\n            However, note: the above formulas assume that the array is sorted. But what if the array has more than two distinct values and we remove an element that is not the min? Then the min and max might not change. But we are only concerned with the two candidate removals: the min and the max.\n\n            But note: the problem says we can remove any element. However, we have argued that removing an interior element doesn't help. Therefore, the answer is the minimum between:\n\n                candidate_min_removed and candidate_max_removed\n\n            However, wait: what if the array has only one distinct value? Then:\n\n                b = [x, x, ..., x] (n times)\n\n                candidate_min_removed = x - (if x != x? False -> so use x) = x-x=0.\n                candidate_max_removed = (if x != x? False -> use x) - x = 0.\n\n                So the answer is 0.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            But wait: what if we have an array like [1,2,3]?\n\n                candidate_min_removed = 3 - (if 1!=2 -> True, so use 2) = 3-2=1.\n                candidate_max_removed = (if 3!=2 -> True, so use 2) - 1 = 2-1=1.\n\n                Answer = 1.\n\n            Let's verify: \n                Original: [1,2,3] -> remove 1: [2,3] -> 3-2=1; remove 3: [1,2] -> 2-1=1; remove 2: [1,3] -> 3-1=2. So the minimum is 1.\n\n            So the algorithm:\n\n                Step 1: Read n and the list a.\n                Step 2: Sort the list -> b.\n                Step 3: \n                    candidate1 = b[-1] - (b[1] if b[0] != b[1] else b[0])\n                    candidate2 = (b[-2] if b[-1] != b[-2] else b[-1]) - b[0]\n\n                Step 4: Print the minimum of candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n            However, wait: is it possible that candidate1 or candidate2 is negative? No, because the array is sorted.\n\n            But note: candidate1 is computed as: \n                candidate1 = b[-1] - (b[1] if b[0]!=b[1] else b[0])\n\n            This is always non-negative because b[-1] >= b[0] and if we use b[0] then b[-1] >= b[0] so candidate1>=0.\n\n            Similarly, candidate2: (b[-2] if ...) is at least b[0] (since sorted) and we subtract b[0] so non-negative.\n\n            However, there's a catch: what if the array has two elements? Then:\n\n                b = [x,y] (sorted, so x<=y)\n\n                candidate1: if x != y -> use y - x (because the new min is y) -> but wait: if we remove x, then the array is [y] -> instability 0? \n                Actually, we are using: candidate_min_removed = y - (if x!=y then y else x) -> if x!=y, then we use y (the next element) but wait, the next element in the sorted array is y. So then candidate_min_removed = y - y = 0.\n\n                candidate_max_removed = (if y != x then use x) - x = x - x = 0.\n\n                Then the answer is 0.\n\n            But wait: the example [1,2] (n=2) should yield:\n\n                Removing 1: [2] -> instability 0.\n                Removing 2: [1] -> instability 0.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            However, wait: the formula for candidate_min_removed in the two-element case: \n                We are removing the min (which is the first element) and then the new min is the next element (which is the only element left). So the instability is (max of [2]) - (min of [2]) = 2-2=0.\n\n            But note: the formula uses the next element (b[1]) which is 2, and then subtracts that from the max (which is 2) -> 0.\n\n            Similarly, candidate_max_removed: \n                We remove the max (which is the last element) and then the new max is the previous element (if the max is unique) -> so if the max is unique, we use the previous element (b[-2]=1) and then subtract the min (1) -> 0.\n\n            But wait: in the two-element case, the array is [1,2]. \n                candidate_min_removed = 2 - (if 1!=2 then 2 else 1) -> 2-2=0.\n                candidate_max_removed = (if 2!=1 then 1 else 2) - 1 -> 1-1=0.\n\n            It works.\n\n            However, note: the formula for candidate_min_removed uses the entire array's max (b[-1]) and the next distinct min (if the min is unique then use the next element, else use the min). But wait, in the two-element case, the next element is the max. And that is correct because after removing the min, the remaining array has one element (the max) so the min and max are the same.\n\n            Therefore, the code:\n\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                a.sort()\n                if n == 1:\n                    # but n>=2 per the problem, so we don't need this.\n                    print(0)\n                else:\n                    # candidate when removing the smallest element\n                    if a[0] != a[1]:\n                        cand1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n                    else:\n                        cand1 = a[-1] - a[0]   # because even if we remove one occurrence of the min, the min remains the same (since there are duplicates)\n\n                    # candidate when removing the largest element\n                    if a[-1] != a[-2]:\n                        cand2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n                    else:\n                        cand2 = a[-1] - a[0]\n\n                    # However, wait: the above cand1 and cand2 are not symmetric in the sense that we are not considering the entire array's min and max.\n\n                    # But note: the entire array's min is a[0] and max is a[-1]. The instability when removing the min (if unique) is a[-1] - a[1] (because the min becomes a[1] and the max remains a[-1]). \n                    # Similarly, when removing the max (if unique) is a[-2] - a[0].\n\n                    # However, in the case of duplicates for the min, we don't change the min (so instability remains a[-1]-a[0]), but we don't change the max either? Actually, no: the min remains the same, so the instability remains the same.\n\n                    # But wait, we are only removing one element. The entire array's min and max are fixed. \n\n                    # However, note: the above cand1 and cand2 are computed correctly.\n\n                    # But wait: what if we remove the min and the min is duplicated? Then the min doesn't change, so the instability is still the same (a[-1]-a[0]). Similarly for the max.\n\n                    # But note: we are comparing two candidates: one from removing the min and one from removing the max.\n\n                    # However, is it possible that removing the min or the max gives the same result as the original? Then we are okay.\n\n                    # But note: the problem allows removing any element. However, we have argued that removing an interior element doesn't change the instability, so the minimal instability we can get is the minimum between cand1 and cand2.\n\n                    # However, wait: what if the array has more than two elements and we remove an element that is the min and there are duplicates, then cand1 = a[-1]-a[0] (same as original). Similarly, cand2 might be the same.\n\n                    # But note: we are allowed to remove any element. So we are not forced to remove the min or the max? However, we have argued that the only chance to reduce the instability is to remove the min or the max. Removing an interior element doesn't change the min or the max, so the instability remains the original. Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between the original (if we don't remove the min or the max) and the two candidates (if we remove the min or the max). However, note: the original instability is the same as cand1 and cand2 in the case of duplicates.\n\n                    # But wait: if we remove an element that is not the min and not the max, the instability remains the same as the original. So we don't need to consider it because we are already including the original (via cand1 and cand2 being the same as the original in the duplicate cases). However, the minimal instability we can get is the minimum between cand1 and cand2.\n\n                    # But note: the original instability is the same as cand1 and cand2 in the duplicate cases, so we are covering the possibility of not reducing the instability.\n\n                    # Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n                    ans = min(cand1, cand2)\n\n                    However, wait: is it possible that cand1 and cand2 are the same as the original, but there's a removal that gives an even lower instability? \n\n                    Example: [1,2,3,4] -> cand1 = 4-2=2, cand2=3-1=2 -> answer=2.\n\n                    But note: we cannot get lower than 2 because the entire array spans from 1 to 4, and if we remove one element, the remaining array must have a spread of at least 2 (if we remove 1 or 4, we get 2 or 3 respectively). \n\n                    So the code is:\n\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                    a.sort()\n                    if a[0] != a[1]:\n                        cand1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n                    else:\n                        cand1 = a[-1] - a[0]   # because after removing one min, the min is still a[0] (if duplicates) so instability remains the same.\n\n                    if a[-1] != a[-2]:\n                        cand2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n                    else:\n                        cand2 = a[-1] - a[0]\n\n                    print(min(cand1, cand2))\n\n            Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: Input: \"4\\n1 3 3 7\"\n                a = [1,3,3,7] -> sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n                cand1: a[0]!=a[1] -> 1!=3 -> True, so cand1 = 7 - 3 = 4.\n                cand2: a[-1]!=a[-2] -> 7!=3 -> True, so cand2 = 3 - 1 = 2.\n                Then min(4,2)=2 -> Output: 2.\n\n            Example 2: Input: \"2\\n1 100000\"\n                a = [1,100000] -> sorted is [1,100000]\n                cand1: 1!=100000 -> True, so cand1=100000-100000=0? \n                    Wait: no: a[1] is 100000, so cand1 = 100000 - 100000 = 0.\n                cand2: 100000 != 1 -> True, so cand2=1-1=0.\n                Then output 0.\n\n            However, wait: the example input was \"2\\n1 100000\", and the expected output is 0. Correct.\n\n            But wait: in the example [1,100000] (two elements), removing the min (1) leaves [100000] -> instability 0. Removing the max (100000) leaves [1] -> instability 0. So 0 is correct.\n\n            Another test: [1,2,3,4] (as above) -> output 2.\n\n            However, wait: the example [1,3,3,7] worked.\n\n            But wait, the example [1,3,3,7] gave 2, which is correct.\n\n            But wait: what if we have [1,2,2,3]?\n\n                cand1: remove the min (1) -> the array becomes [2,2,3] -> instability=3-2=1.\n                cand2: remove the max (3) -> the array becomes [1,2,2] -> instability=2-1=1.\n\n                Our code:\n\n                a = [1,2,2,3] -> sorted is [1,2,2,3]\n                cand1: a[0]!=a[1] -> 1!=2 -> True, so cand1 = 3 - 2 = 1.\n                cand2: a[-1]!=a[-2] -> 3!=2 -> True, so cand2 = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\n                Then answer=1.\n\n            But wait, what if we remove the middle 2? Then the array is [1,2,3] -> instability=3-1=2. Worse.\n\n            So the minimal instability is 1.\n\n            One more test: [1,1,1,1] -> all ones.\n\n                cand1: a[0]==a[1] -> True, so cand1 = 1-1=0.\n                cand2: a[-1]==a[-2] -> True, so cand2=1-1=0.\n\n                Answer=0.\n\n            It seems correct.\n\n            However, wait: what if the array has more than two distinct values and we remove the min or the max, but the resulting array has a min that is not the next distinct value because the next distinct value is not contiguous? \n\n            Example: [1,2,4,5] (remove the min)\n\n                cand1: remove min -> the new min is 2, so instability=5-2=3.\n\n                Our code: \n                    a = [1,2,4,5]\n                    cand1: a[0]!=a[1] -> 1!=2 -> True, so cand1 = 5 - 2 = 3.\n\n                cand2: remove max -> new max is 4, so instability=4-1=3.\n\n                Our code: a[-1]!=a[-2] -> 5!=4 -> True, so cand2=4-1=3.\n\n                Then the answer is 3.\n\n            But note: the original instability is 5-1=4. And indeed, if we remove the min, we get 3, and if we remove the max, we get 3. And if we remove the interior (2 or 4) we get 4 (if remove 2: [1,4,5] -> 5-1=4; remove 4: [1,2,5] -> 5-1=4). So the minimal is 3.\n\n            But wait, what if we remove 2? Then the array becomes [1,4,5] -> instability=4. \n            Removing 4: [1,2,5] -> instability=4.\n\n            So the minimal is 3.\n\n            However, note: is there a possibility that by removing an element that is not the min or the max we can get a lower instability? \n\n            Example: [1,2,4,5] -> no, because the min and max remain the same.\n\n            But wait, consider [1,10,11,12] (n=4)\n\n                Removing the min (1): [10,11,12] -> instability=12-10=2.\n                Removing the max (12): [1,10,11] -> instability=11-1=10.\n                Removing the middle 10: [1,11,12] -> instability=12-1=11.\n                Removing the middle 11: [1,10,12] -> instability=12-1=11.\n\n            Our code:\n\n                a = [1,10,11,12]\n                cand1: 1!=10 -> True, so cand1=12-10=2.\n                cand2: 12!=11 -> True, so cand2=11-1=10.\n\n                Then answer=2.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                a.sort()\n                if a[0] != a[1]:\n                    cand1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n                else:\n                    cand1 = a[-1] - a[0]\n\n                if a[-1] != a[-2]:\n                    cand2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n                else:\n                    cand2 = a[-1] - a[0]\n\n                print(min(cand1, cand2))\n\n            But wait, why in the example [1,10,11,12] we set cand2 to 11-1? \n\n                cand2 is computed as: if the last element is unique then use the last but one element (which is 11) and subtract the min (1). So 11-1=10.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the minimal instability is achieved by either removing the smallest or the largest element from the array. Removing any other element does not change the min or max values, hence the instability remains the same as the original array.\n2. **Intuition**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the smallest and largest elements. The instability after removing the smallest element (if unique) is the difference between the largest element and the next smallest element. Similarly, the instability after removing the largest element (if unique) is the difference between the next largest element and the smallest element.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Sort the array to easily identify the smallest and largest elements.\n   - Check if the smallest element is unique. If it is, compute the instability after its removal; otherwise, the instability remains unchanged.\n   - Similarly, check if the largest element is unique. If it is, compute the instability after its removal; otherwise, the instability remains unchanged.\n   - The answer is the minimum value between the two computed instabilities (or the original instability if no reduction is possible).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif a[0] != a[1]:\n    cand1 = a[-1] - a[1]\nelse:\n    cand1 = a[-1] - a[0]\n\nif a[-1] != a[-2]:\n    cand2 = a[-2] - a[0]\nelse:\n    cand2 = a[-1] - a[0]\n\nprint(min(cand1, cand2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest (`a[0]`) and largest (`a[-1]`) elements.\n3. **Candidate Calculation**:\n   - **cand1**: If the smallest element is unique, the instability after its removal is `a[-1] - a[1]` (the largest element minus the next smallest). Otherwise, the instability remains `a[-1] - a[0]`.\n   - **cand2**: If the largest element is unique, the instability after its removal is `a[-2] - a[0]` (the next largest element minus the smallest). Otherwise, the instability remains `a[-1] - a[0]`.\n4. **Result**: The minimum value between `cand1` and `cand2` is printed, representing the minimal possible instability after removing one element.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem to checking only two critical scenarios (removing the smallest or largest element) and leverages sorting for quick access to these elements, ensuring optimal performance even for large arrays.",
