Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n and x (the total desired duration) and then n lines of [l, r, cost]\n Each voucher has duration = r - l + 1.\n\n Conditions:\n We need two distinct vouchers i and j such that:\n   (duration_i + duration_j == x) and the two intervals [li, ri] and [lj, rj] do not intersect (at least one condition: ri < lj or rj < li).\n\n We want the minimal total cost.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since x can be up to 200,000 and the days (l, r) are also in [1, 200000], we can consider grouping by duration.\n\n Let's define:\n   For each voucher, let d = r - l + 1.\n\n Then we are looking for two durations d1 and d2 such that d1 + d2 = x.\n\n But note: the two vouchers must not overlap. So we have two cases for non-overlap:\n   Case 1: [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] with r1 < l2 (so the first ends before the second starts)\n   Case 2: [l2, r2] and [l1, r1] with r2 < l1 (so the second ends before the first starts)\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the first voucher to be before the second. So we have two possibilities.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Group the vouchers by their duration. But note: there may be multiple vouchers with the same duration.\n\n    Let's create a dictionary (or list of lists) for durations from 1 to x (since d1+d2=x, then each d must be at least 1 and at most x-1).\n\n    But note: the duration of a voucher can be from 1 to (max_day - min_day + 1) but our days are up to 200000, so maximum duration is 200000.\n\n    However, x can be up to 200000, so we only need to consider durations d such that 1 <= d <= x-1 (because if d > x-1 then d2 = x-d would be negative, which is invalid).\n\n 2. But wait, we have two conditions: \n        Condition A: r1 < l2   (voucher1 ends before voucher2 starts)\n        Condition B: r2 < l1   (voucher2 ends before voucher1 starts)\n\n    We cannot simply group by duration and then pick two with the same cost because the time intervals must not overlap.\n\n 3. How to enforce non-overlap? \n\n    We can precompute for each duration d, the set of vouchers (each voucher is (l, r, cost)) and then for each pair of durations (d, x-d) we need to check non-overlap.\n\n    However, the number of vouchers can be up to 200000, so we cannot iterate over all pairs.\n\n 4. Alternative idea:\n\n    We are going to break the problem into two parts:\n\n    Part 1: For each duration d, we want to store the vouchers (with duration d) in a way that we can quickly retrieve the minimum cost for a voucher that ends by day t (for condition A: we need a voucher with duration d and ending at most t, and similarly for condition B).\n\n    But note: condition A requires that the first voucher ends (r1) before the second voucher starts (l2). Similarly, condition B requires that the second voucher ends (r2) before the first voucher starts (l1).\n\n    We can think of two cases separately.\n\n    Case 1: First voucher (duration d1) and second voucher (duration d2) with d1+d2 = x, and they don't overlap because the first ends before the second starts.\n\n        We require: r1 < l2.\n\n        For a fixed d1, we want to find a voucher of duration d2 = x - d1 such that its start day l2 is greater than r1.\n\n        Also, we want the minimal cost for the second voucher (of duration d2) that satisfies l2 > r1.\n\n    Case 2: Similarly, the second voucher ends before the first starts: r2 < l1.\n\n        Then we require: r2 < l1, and d1+d2 = x.\n\n        Now, for a fixed d1, we are looking for a voucher of duration d2 = x-d1 with end day r2 < l1.\n\n 5. We can precompute for each duration d:\n\n        We'll store two things for each voucher of duration d?\n        Actually, we need to relate the start and end days.\n\n    But note: we have three parameters: l, r, cost. And we know that d = r-l+1 => r = l + d - 1.\n\n    So for a voucher (l, r, cost) with duration d, we have r = l + d - 1.\n\n    Therefore, we can represent a voucher by (l, d, cost) and then r = l+d-1.\n\n    Conditions become:\n\n        Case 1: (voucher1: l1, d1) and (voucher2: l2, d2) with d1+d2=x, and we require r1 < l2 -> l1+d1-1 < l2.\n\n        Case 2: (voucher1: l1, d1) and (voucher2: l2, d2) with d1+d2=x, and we require r2 < l1 -> l2+d2-1 < l1.\n\n 6. We can precompute:\n\n        For each duration d (that is between 1 and x-1), we want to store:\n\n          - The minimum cost for any voucher of duration d (but that is not enough, we need to consider the start and end as well)\n\n        Alternatively, we can preprocess for each duration d:\n\n          - A sorted list of the start days (l) and then for a given l, the end day is fixed: r = l+d-1.\n\n          - Then, for a fixed d, we can also store the minimal cost for a voucher that starts at a particular l, but we don't need to go that far.\n\n 7. Instead, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute an array for each duration d (from 1 to maybe max_duration, but note we only care about d in [1, x-1]) and store:\n\n            For each d, we want to record:\n                - The minimal cost for a voucher of duration d, but that alone is not sufficient because we have constraints on l and r.\n\n        However, we can also consider storing for each duration d:\n\n            - A list of (l, cost) for each voucher.\n\n        Then, for a fixed d, we can sort the list by l. Then, we can also precompute for each d:\n\n            - A prefix minimum for cost (by l) and also the suffix part for l? Actually, we need to query: for a given threshold (say, for Case 1: we require l2 > r1 = l1+d1-1), then we want the minimal cost among all vouchers of duration d2 that have l2 > some value.\n\n        Similarly, for Case 2, we require l1 > r2 = l2+d2-1, so we can use the same structure but then query by l1 being greater than (l2+d2-1).\n\n 8. We can build:\n\n        Let's create two dictionaries:\n\n            dict1: key = duration d, value = list of (l, cost) for vouchers of duration d.\n\n        Then, for each duration d, we sort the list by l, and then we can precompute:\n\n            prefix_min[d]: for increasing l, the minimal cost from the beginning to current index.\n            suffix_min[d]: for decreasing l, the minimal cost from current index to the end.\n\n        But actually, for Case 1:\n\n            We have two durations: d1 and d2 = x-d1.\n\n            We are going to iterate over vouchers of duration d1 (each voucher gives l1, then we require for the second voucher (duration d2): l2 > l1+d1-1.\n\n            Then we want the minimal cost of any voucher of duration d2 with l2 > (l1+d1-1).\n\n        So for each d2, we have a sorted list of l's (and we have stored the minimal cost for each l? Not exactly, but we can do binary search to find the first l2 that is greater than (l1+d1-1) and then take the minimal cost from that point onward.\n\n        Similarly, for Case 2, we require for the first voucher (duration d1) that l1 > (l2+d2-1). But note: in Case 2, the roles are reversed: the second voucher is of duration d2 and we are using it to set the condition for the first. So we can do:\n\n            For each voucher of duration d2 (with l2, then condition: l1 > l2+d2-1) and then look for the minimal cost of a voucher of duration d1 (with l1 > l2+d2-1).\n\n 9. However, note that we have two cases and we are iterating over two different sets. We can combine by processing both cases by symmetry.\n\n    Alternatively, we can process:\n\n        For each duration d1 (from 1 to x-1) such that d2 = x-d1 is also a valid duration (i.e., d2 in the dictionary and d1 <= x-d1, to avoid double counting? But note: we are allowed to use two distinct vouchers and the two durations are fixed. But wait: d1 and d2 might be the same if x is even? Then we must ensure that we use two different vouchers. However, the problem allows two distinct vouchers (same duration is allowed if there are two different vouchers).\n\n        But note: the condition for non-overlap is symmetric, but we have two cases.\n\n    However, we must consider that the two vouchers are distinct, so if d1==d2, then we are looking for two different vouchers (so we cannot use the same voucher twice).\n\n    But note: the input does not say that the vouchers are distinct, but we are choosing two distinct ones (i≠j). So we must ensure that when d1==d2, we are not accidentally taking the same voucher twice.\n\n 10. Steps:\n\n        Let's create:\n\n            durs = defaultdict(list)   # key: duration, value: list of (l, cost)\n\n        Then, for each voucher, compute d = r-l+1, and append (l, cost) to durs[d].\n\n        Then, for each duration d, we sort the list of (l, cost) by l. Then, we can precompute for each d:\n\n            arr_d = sorted(durs[d], key=lambda x: x[0])   # sort by l\n            Then, we can extract the l's and costs, and then build an array of (l, cost) and then for each l, we want to know the minimal cost for any voucher with start >= L.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            For each d, we sort by l, and then we can create an array of l's and then a suffix minimum array for the cost.\n\n            Example for d: \n                Let arr = sorted([ (l, cost) for ... ])\n                Let L_arr = [a[0] for a in arr]\n                Let cost_arr = [a[1] for a in arr]\n\n                Then, we can compute an array min_suffix[i] = minimum cost from index i to the end.\n\n            Then, for a given threshold T (we require l2 > T), we can find the smallest index i such that L_arr[i] > T. Then the minimal cost for that d is min_suffix[i] (if exists).\n\n        Similarly, we can build a structure for querying minimal cost for a given d and a lower bound on l.\n\n        But note: we have two cases. In Case 1, we fix a voucher of duration d1 (with l1) and then we require for duration d2: l2 > l1+d1-1.\n\n        Then, the minimal cost for duration d2 above that l is the candidate.\n\n        Similarly, in Case 2, we fix a voucher of duration d2 (with l2) and then require for duration d1: l1 > l2+d2-1.\n\n        However, we can also consider processing both cases together by symmetry. But note: the two cases are symmetric only if we swap the order. Actually, the problem does not specify which voucher comes first. So we can consider:\n\n            Total solution = min( case1_result, case2_result )\n\n        But note: in Case 1, we assume the first voucher is the one with duration d1 and the second with duration d2. In Case 2, we assume the first is d2 and the second is d1. But the condition is independent of order. Actually, the condition \"don't intersect\" is symmetric. However, we must account for both orders because the two vouchers are distinct and we are allowed to assign either one as the first.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider that the two vouchers are unordered. Then, we can just consider the two cases without fixing the order? Actually, no: the two conditions (Case 1 and Case 2) are the two ways the two intervals can be disjoint. So we must consider both.\n\n        However, note: the two conditions are mutually exclusive (if one holds then the other doesn't necessarily hold, and we require at least one). But we are allowed to use both? Actually, we are just requiring non-overlap, and the two conditions cover all non-overlapping cases (the intervals are either separated or one is entirely to the left of the other). So we have two types of non-overlap.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            ans = a very big number\n\n            Case 1: For each duration d1 from 1 to x-1 (if d1 <= x-d1, then d2 = x-d1 is at least d1? Actually, we don't need to restrict d1<=d2, but we can iterate without duplication? Actually, we can iterate over all d1 from 1 to x-1, and then d2 = x-d1. Then, we consider both d1 and d2. But note: if d1 != d2, then we are going to consider the same pair twice (once for (d1,d2) and once for (d2,d1))? We should avoid that.\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate for each voucher of duration d1 (and then d2 = x-d1) and then check the two cases without worrying about order? Actually, we can break the problem into:\n\n            For each voucher i (duration d1) and for each voucher j (duration d2) such that d1+d2=x and the two are non-overlapping.\n\n        But that is O(n^2) and n=200000, so we cannot do that.\n\n 11. We need an efficient method.\n\n        Idea:\n\n            Precomputation:\n\n                Let D = {}  # mapping from duration d to a sorted list of (l, cost) for that duration.\n\n                Then, for each d, we build a sorted list of the start days (l) and also a mapping from l to the minimal cost for that l? Not exactly, we want to query by l.\n\n                Actually, for each d, we build:\n\n                    events: sorted by l, and then we precompute an array for the minimal cost for any voucher with start >= L.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    For each d, let arr = sorted([(l, cost) for each voucher of duration d])\n                    Then, we can create an array of l's and then a suffix min array for the cost.\n\n            Then, we iterate over each duration d1 from 1 to x-1:\n\n                d2 = x - d1\n\n                If d1 not in D or d2 not in D: skip.\n\n                Then, we consider two cases:\n\n                    Case 1: non-overlap via first ends before second starts.\n\n                        For each voucher of duration d1 (l1, cost1):\n\n                            We require for the second voucher (duration d2): l2 > l1 + d1 - 1.\n\n                            Then, we look in D[d2] for the minimal cost among vouchers with l2 > (l1+d1-1).\n\n                            Then, candidate = cost1 + (minimal cost found in D[d2] for l2 > (l1+d1-1))\n\n                    Case 2: non-overlap via second ends before first starts.\n\n                        Similarly, for each voucher of duration d1 (l1, cost1):\n\n                            We require for the second voucher (duration d2): l2 + d2 - 1 < l1.\n\n                            Then, we look in D[d2] for the minimal cost among vouchers with l2 < (l1 - (d2-1))  [because l2 + d2 - 1 < l1  => l2 < l1 - (d2-1)]\n\n                But note: in Case 2, the condition is: the second voucher (which has duration d2) must end before the first starts. The first voucher starts at l1, and the second ends at l2+d2-1, so we require l2+d2-1 < l1.\n\n                However, we are iterating over the first voucher (d1) and then checking the second (d2). But what about the other order? \n\n                Actually, we are covering both orders by considering both cases. But note: in Case 1, we are assuming the first voucher is d1 and the second is d2. In Case 2, we are assuming the first voucher is d1 and the second is d2? Wait, no: in Case 2, the condition is that the second voucher (which is d2) must end before the first (d1) starts. So the order is fixed: the first voucher is d1 and the second is d2. But the condition is on the second voucher (d2) to end before the first (d1) starts.\n\n                However, note: the problem does not specify an order of travel. The two vouchers are chosen arbitrarily. But the non-overlap condition is defined by the intervals. We are allowed to assign the two vouchers arbitrarily to the two parts of the vacation? Actually, the problem says: split his own vacation into two parts. So the two parts must be consecutive? \n\n                Let me re-read: \"Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x\"\n\n                There is no requirement that one voucher must come before the other. However, the condition for non-intersection is given by two conditions: either the first ends before the second starts, OR the second ends before the first starts. But note: the two parts of the vacation are consecutive? The problem does not specify the order. \n\n                However, the condition for non-intersection is independent of order. The two intervals must not overlap. So if we have two intervals [a, b] and [c, d], then they do not overlap if b < c or d < a. This is symmetric.\n\n                Therefore, we can consider:\n\n                    Condition 1: [d1] ends before [d2] starts: r1 < l2 -> (l1+d1-1) < l2.\n                    Condition 2: [d2] ends before [d1] starts: r2 < l1 -> (l2+d2-1) < l1.\n\n                These are two independent conditions. So we must consider both.\n\n                But note: we are iterating over the first voucher (d1) and then the second (d2). Then, we are covering:\n\n                    Case 1: condition1 (using d1 as first and d2 as second)\n                    Case 2: condition2 (using d1 as first and d2 as second)\n\n                However, in Case 2, we are requiring that the second voucher (d2) ends before the first (d1) starts. But what if we consider the other order? \n\n                Actually, we are not. Because we are always iterating over the first voucher (d1) and then the second (d2). But the problem does not require the first voucher to be the one we are iterating over. \n\n                But note: the two conditions are:\n\n                    Condition1: d1 ends before d2 starts -> we require r1 < l2.\n                    Condition2: d2 ends before d1 starts -> we require r2 < l1.\n\n                These two conditions are independent. And note that the two conditions cannot both be true (unless the intervals are adjacent or something, but actually if one condition holds the other might not, and we require at least one). But we are looking for any non-overlap.\n\n                However, we are covering the two possibilities by:\n\n                    Case1: Condition1 (first ends before second starts) -> we use d1 as the first and d2 as the second.\n\n                    Case2: Condition2 (second ends before first starts) -> we use d1 as the first and d2 as the second.\n\n                But wait, what if we have two vouchers and we want to use d2 as the first and d1 as the second? Then we would get:\n\n                    Condition1: r2 < l1 -> (l2+d2-1) < l1 -> same as Case2 above? No, wait:\n\n                    Condition1: if we consider d2 as the first and d1 as the second, then Condition1: r2 < l1 -> (l2+d2-1) < l1.\n\n                    Condition2: then Condition2: r1 < l2 -> (l1+d1-1) < l2.\n\n                So actually, the two conditions are symmetric. Therefore, we can consider:\n\n                    We are iterating over all pairs (d1, d2) and then for each voucher of d1 we check both conditions (against the set of vouchers of d2). \n\n                But note: we are iterating by d1 and d2 = x-d1, and we are checking for each voucher of d1 against the set of d2. This covers:\n\n                    For a given pair (d1, d2) (with d1+d2=x), we check:\n\n                      Case1: for a voucher of d1 (with start l1) and a voucher of d2 (with start l2): condition1 (d1 ends before d2 starts) -> l1+d1-1 < l2.\n                      Case2: for a voucher of d1 (with start l1) and a voucher of d2 (with start l2): condition2 (d2 ends before d1 starts) -> l2+d2-1 < l1.\n\n                But note: the same pair (d1, d2) is considered only once (since d1 and d2 are fixed by the equation d1+d2=x). And we are iterating over all vouchers of d1.\n\n                However, what if d1 == d2? Then we must ensure that we don't use the same voucher twice. But note: the input vouchers are distinct, and we are storing by duration, so if d1==d2, then we are storing all vouchers of that duration. Then, when we are iterating over a voucher of d1, we are allowed to use another voucher of d2 (which is the same duration) as long as it is distinct.\n\n                But wait: in the condition, we require two distinct vouchers. So if d1==d2, then we must make sure that we don't use the same voucher twice. However, in our method, we are storing all vouchers for a given duration, including duplicates (if two vouchers have the same (l, cost) and same duration, that's okay). But we are storing the entire list. Then, when we query for the second voucher, we are getting the entire list of d2 (which is the same as d1). Then, we are including the same voucher? \n\n                How do we avoid that?\n\n                We are iterating over each voucher of d1, and then for each we query d2 (which is the same as d1) for vouchers that satisfy the condition. Then, if a voucher is used as the first, we must not use it again as the second. But note: the condition is defined by the intervals. The same voucher cannot be used twice because the two vouchers must be distinct.\n\n                However, the condition for non-overlap might be satisfied by the same voucher? \n\n                Example: two identical vouchers (same l, same r, same cost) with duration d. Then, for two copies, we can use them. But if we have only one copy, then we cannot.\n\n                Therefore, we must not use the same voucher twice. But our data structure for d2 (which is d1) includes all vouchers of duration d1. Then, when we query for a voucher in d1, we are including the current one? \n\n                How do we avoid that? \n\n                We could store the vouchers per duration and then, for a given voucher (l1, cost1) of duration d1, we must not use a voucher in d2 (which is the same duration) that is the same voucher? But wait: the input does not tell us which voucher is which. We are just storing (l, cost). \n\n                Actually, the problem does not say that the two vouchers are identified by distinct (l, cost). There could be two vouchers with the same (l, cost). \n\n                However, we are storing the entire list. Then, when we query for d2, we are getting the minimal cost for any voucher (including the same one). But we don't know which one is the same. \n\n                But note: we are iterating over each voucher of d1 and then querying d2. We are not excluding any voucher. \n\n                This will include the possibility of using the same voucher twice if the condition holds. However, if the same voucher is used twice, then we have:\n\n                    Condition1: r1 < l2 -> but if the voucher is the same, then r1 = l1+d1-1, and l2 = l1, so we require l1+d1-1 < l1 -> d1-1 < 0 -> d1<1, which is impossible. Similarly, Condition2: l2+d2-1 < l1 -> same voucher: l1+d1-1 < l1 -> same condition. \n\n                Therefore, the same voucher cannot be used to satisfy both conditions (non-overlap) because the interval [l1, l1+d1-1] must contain itself and hence cannot be disjoint from itself.\n\n                But wait: the condition is that the two intervals must not intersect. Two identical intervals definitely intersect (they are the same). So the same voucher cannot be used.\n\n                However, what if we have two different vouchers with the same (l, cost)? Then they are different and we are allowed. But our query does not know which ones are the same. \n\n                Actually, we don't care: we are storing all vouchers. We are just querying by (l, cost) and the condition. We are not matching by identity. \n\n                So the issue is: if we have two different vouchers with the same (l, cost) and same duration, then they are stored as two separate entries. Then, when we query, we will see both. That's correct.\n\n                But if we have one voucher, then we cannot form a pair with itself. Our query for d2 (same as d1) will return the same voucher if it meets the condition? But we just saw that the condition for the same voucher fails. So even if we have only one voucher, the condition fails, so we don't pick it.\n\n                However, if we have two different vouchers (same duration, same l, same cost) then they are two distinct vouchers and we can use them. \n\n                But note: the condition for non-overlap: if two vouchers have the same (l, cost) and same duration, then they are identical. Then, they must overlap (if they are the same). So we cannot use two identical vouchers (same interval) because they are not disjoint. \n\n                Therefore, we must ensure that the two vouchers are distinct and non-overlapping. \n\n                How do we handle the same (l, cost) for two different vouchers? \n\n                Actually, the input may give two vouchers with the same (l, cost) and same duration. Then, they are two distinct vouchers. But note: they are the same interval. Then, they are not disjoint. \n\n                Therefore, we must not use two identical intervals. \n\n                So our method of querying by l and cost is insufficient to distinguish identical intervals? \n\n                Actually, we are storing the entire list. Then, when we query for d2, we are getting the minimal cost for any voucher in d2 that satisfies the condition. But if we have two identical vouchers, then they are two different entries, but they have the same l and same cost. Then, the condition for non-overlap (using one of them as the first and the other as the second) fails because the first voucher's interval is [l, l+d1-1] and the second is [l, l+d1-1] so they intersect.\n\n                Therefore, we don't need to worry: the condition (non-overlap) will automatically fail for two identical intervals.\n\n 12. Implementation:\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Read input.\n\n            Build dictionary D: key = duration, value = list of (l, cost)\n\n            Then, for each duration d in D, sort the list by l, and then build an array for the l's and a suffix minimum array for the costs.\n\n            Then, initialize ans = a large number (like 10**18)\n\n            Then, for each duration d1 from 1 to x-1:\n\n                d2 = x - d1\n\n                If d2 < 1: continue   (because duration must be at least 1)\n\n                If d1 not in D or d2 not in D: continue\n\n                Then, we consider the two cases:\n\n                    Case1: Condition1 (voucher1 ends before voucher2 starts)\n\n                        For each voucher in D[d1] (each element is (l1, cost1)):\n\n                            We require for voucher2 (in D[d2]): l2 > l1 + d1 - 1.\n\n                            Then, we want the minimal cost among all vouchers in D[d2] with l2 > (l1+d1-1).\n\n                        How to do that quickly?\n\n                            We have D[d2] sorted by l, and we built a suffix min array for the costs (from high l to low l). Actually, we built a sorted list by l, so we can binary search for the first index where l2 > (l1+d1-1).\n\n                            Let target = l1 + d1 - 1\n\n                            Then, in D[d2] (which is sorted by l), we can find the smallest l2 that is greater than target.\n\n                            Then, the minimal cost for D[d2] from that index to the end (if any) is the candidate.\n\n                    Case2: Condition2 (voucher2 ends before voucher1 starts)\n\n                        Similarly, for each voucher in D[d1] (l1, cost1):\n\n                            We require for voucher2 (in D[d2]): l2 + d2 - 1 < l1   -> l2 < l1 - (d2-1)\n\n                            Then, we want the minimal cost among all vouchers in D[d2] with l2 < (l1 - (d2-1))\n\n            Then, update ans = min(ans, cost1 + candidate_cost) for the candidate found in each case.\n\n            But note: we are iterating over each voucher of d1 and for each we do two queries (one for each case). This is O(n) per duration, and the total number of vouchers is n (up to 200000). But note: we are iterating over each voucher of d1, and then for each we do two binary searches (each O(log n)). Then, the total work is O(n log n) for each d1. And the sum over d1: the total number of vouchers is n, so the overall complexity is O(n log n) which is acceptable for n=200000.\n\n            However, we are iterating for each d1 from 1 to x-1 (x up to 200000). But note: many d1 values will not appear in D. We only iterate over d1 that are in D. The number of distinct durations is at most the number of distinct d in the input, which is at most 200000, but the input has n=200000, so the distinct durations might be up to 200000.\n\n            But worst-case, we have 200000 distinct durations, and then we do for each d1 (that is present) two passes (one for each case) and each pass iterates over all vouchers of d1 and does two binary searches (O(log n)).\n\n            The total work is: for each distinct duration d1, we do (#vouchers in d1) * (log n) * 2.\n\n            And the sum of (#vouchers in d1) over all d1 is n (the total number of vouchers). Therefore, the total work is O(n log n).\n\n 13. However, note: we are building for each duration d the sorted list and the suffix min array. The building of the sorted list and suffix min array for each d is O(m log m) for a duration d with m vouchers.\n\n        The total over all d: the sum of m is n, and the worst-case for building the sorted arrays is O(n log n) overall (because we are sorting each group). Then, the total complexity is O(n log n) which is acceptable.\n\n 14. Implementation details:\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            D = defaultdict(list)\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                read l, r, cost\n                d = r - l + 1\n                D[d].append( (l, cost) )\n\n            Then, for each key d in D:\n                sort D[d] by l\n                Let arr = sorted(D[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n                Let L_arr = [a[0] for a in arr]\n                Let cost_arr = [a[1] for a in arr]\n\n                Then, build a suffix minimum array for the cost_arr (from right to left):\n\n                    suffix_min[i] = minimum value in cost_arr from index i to the end.\n\n                But note: we want to query by l: we need to find the first index i such that L_arr[i] > target (for Case1) or L_arr[i] < target (for Case2). Then, for Case1, we want the minimal cost from that index to the end (suffix_min[i]). For Case2, we want the minimal cost from the beginning to the index i-1 (because we require l2 < target). \n\n                Actually, for Case2:\n\n                    We require l2 < target (where target = l1 - (d2-1))\n\n                    Then, we can use a prefix minimum array for the cost_arr (from left to right).\n\n            So we need:\n\n                For each duration d, we have:\n\n                    sorted_list_by_l = sorted list of (l, cost)\n                    L_arr = sorted_list_by_l's l's (sorted increasingly)\n                    cost_arr = corresponding costs\n\n                    prefix_min[i] = min(cost_arr[0..i])\n                    suffix_min[i] = min(cost_arr[i..end])\n\n            Then:\n\n                Case1: \n                    target = l1 + d1 - 1\n                    Find the smallest index i in L_arr such that L_arr[i] > target.\n                    If found, candidate = suffix_min[i]   (if i exists, i.e., from index i to the end)\n\n                Case2:\n                    target = l1 - (d2-1)   [Note: d2 is the other duration, and we require l2 < target]\n                    Find the largest index i such that L_arr[i] < target. Then, candidate = prefix_min[i] (if any exists, i.e., from the beginning to index i)\n\n            But note: in Case2, the condition is l2 < target. We can also do:\n\n                    Use bisect_left on L_arr for target. Then, the index found (say pos) is the first index >= target. Then, we want the part [0, pos-1] (if any) and the minimal cost in that part is prefix_min[pos-1] (if pos>0).\n\n            Steps for Case1:\n\n                pos = bisect_right(L_arr, target)   # returns the insertion position, so that all elements to the left are <= target. Then, we want the first element at pos (if any) that is > target.\n\n                Actually, we can use bisect_left and bisect_right:\n\n                To find the first index i such that L_arr[i] > target:\n\n                    pos = bisect_right(L_arr, target)   # returns the insertion position, so that all indices < pos have L_arr[i] <= target.\n                    Then, if pos < len(L_arr), then the minimal cost in the suffix from pos is suffix_min[pos].\n\n                For Case2:\n\n                    We want the last index i such that L_arr[i] < target.\n\n                    pos = bisect_left(L_arr, target)   # returns the first index i such that L_arr[i] >= target.\n                    Then, the valid indices are [0, pos-1]. Then, if pos>0, candidate = prefix_min[pos-1] (the minimal cost in [0, pos-1]).\n\n            Example for Case2:\n\n                L_arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 3\n                bisect_left(L_arr, 3) returns 2 (because 3 is at index2). Then, the valid indices are [0,1]. Then, we take prefix_min[1] (if we built prefix_min for [0,1]).\n\n            However, we built prefix",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` days, they do not overlap in time, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently processing the vouchers by grouping them by their duration and then checking for pairs of durations that sum up to `x` while ensuring they do not overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we categorize all vouchers based on their duration (i.e., `r - l + 1`). This allows us to quickly access all vouchers of a specific duration.\n2. **Sort and Precompute Minimum Costs**: For each duration group, we sort the vouchers by their start day (`l`) and precompute prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays. This helps in efficiently finding the minimum cost voucher that meets the non-overlapping condition when paired with another voucher.\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d1`, we compute the complementary duration `d2 = x - d1`. We then iterate through all vouchers of duration `d1` and use binary search to find vouchers of duration `d2` that do not overlap with the current voucher. The non-overlapping conditions are:\n   - **Case 1**: The end of the first voucher is before the start of the second (`r1 < l2`).\n   - **Case 2**: The end of the second voucher is before the start of the first (`r2 < l1`).\n4. **Update Minimum Cost**: For each valid pair found, we update the minimum total cost if the sum of their costs is lower than the current minimum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    vouchers = []\n    index = 2\n    D = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        cost_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        d = r - l + 1\n        D[d].append((l, cost_val))\n        \n    dict_structures = {}\n    for d, arr in D.items():\n        arr_sorted = sorted(arr, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        L_arr = [a[0] for a in arr_sorted]\n        costs = [a[1] for a in arr_sorted]\n        prefix_min = [0] * len(costs)\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(costs)\n        if len(costs) > 0:\n            prefix_min[0] = costs[0]\n            for i in range(1, len(costs)):\n                prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], costs[i])\n            suffix_min[-1] = costs[-1]\n            for i in range(len(costs)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], costs[i])\n        dict_structures[d] = {\n            'L_arr': L_arr,\n            'costs': costs,\n            'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n            'suffix_min': suffix_min\n        }\n    \n    INF = 10**18\n    ans = INF\n    \n    for d1, info in dict_structures.items():\n        d2 = x - d1\n        if d2 < 1 or d2 not in dict_structures:\n            continue\n            \n        arr_d1 = info['L_arr']\n        costs_d1 = info['costs']\n        prefix_min_d1 = info['prefix_min']\n        suffix_min_d1 = info['suffix_min']\n        \n        dict_d2 = dict_structures[d2]\n        arr_d2 = dict_d2['L_arr']\n        prefix_min_d2 = dict_d2['prefix_min']\n        suffix_min_d2 = dict_d2['suffix_min']\n        \n        for i in range(len(arr_d1)):\n            l1 = arr_d1[i]\n            cost1 = costs_d1[i]\n            total_duration = (l1 + d1 - 1) + d2\n            if total_duration != x:\n                continue\n                \n            target1 = l1 + d1 - 1\n            pos1 = bisect.bisect_right(arr_d2, target1)\n            if pos1 < len(arr_d2):\n                candidate_cost1 = suffix_min_d2[pos1]\n                total_cost = cost1 + candidate_cost1\n                if total_cost < ans:\n                    ans = total_cost\n                    \n            target2 = l1 - (d2 - 1)\n            if target2 >= 1:\n                pos2 = bisect.bisect_left(arr_d2, target2)\n                if pos2 > 0:\n                    candidate_cost2 = prefix_min_d2[pos2-1]\n                    total_cost = cost1 + candidate_cost2\n                    if total_cost < ans:\n                        ans = total_cost\n                        \n    if ans == INF:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into individual vouchers, each characterized by its start day, end day, and cost. The duration of each voucher is calculated as `end - start + 1`.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped into a dictionary where keys are durations and values are lists of tuples (start day, cost).\n3. **Sorting and Preprocessing**: For each duration group, the vouchers are sorted by their start day. Prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays are computed to facilitate efficient range minimum queries.\n4. **Finding Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d1`, the complementary duration `d2 = x - d1` is checked. For each voucher in `d1`, binary search is used to find vouchers in `d2` that do not overlap either by ending before the start of the current voucher or starting after the end of the current voucher.
