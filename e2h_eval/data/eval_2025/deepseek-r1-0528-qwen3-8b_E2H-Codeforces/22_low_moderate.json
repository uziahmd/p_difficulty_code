After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m on the first line, then n lines each containing a string of m digits (each digit from '1' to '9')\n Steps:\n 1. We need to find for each subject the maximum mark. Then, for each student, we check if there is at least one subject in which they are the best (i.e., their mark is equal to the maximum for that subject, and note: if multiple students have the same maximum mark, then they are all best in that subject? Actually, the problem says: \"a student is the best at some subject if there is no student with a higher mark\". So if the maximum is achieved by multiple students, then all those students are best in that subject.\n\n However, note: the problem defines a successful student as one who exists in at least one subject he is the best.\n\n Approach:\n Let's create a list (or array) for the marks of each student. Each student's data is a string of m digits.\n\n We can do:\n   Read n and m.\n   Then read the next n lines.\n\n For each subject j (0-indexed), we can compute the maximum mark (as integer or as character? but characters '1' to '9' can be compared lexicographically, but better to convert to int).\n\n But note: we are going to compare per subject.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   Step 1: For each subject j, find the maximum mark (character or integer). Since the input is digits, we can use max() on the string for that column.\n\n   Step 2: For each student i, check for at least one subject j such that the mark of student i in subject j equals the maximum mark for subject j.\n\n However, note: if the maximum mark in a subject is achieved by multiple students, then each of those students gets credit for being best in that subject.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \n        3 3\n        223\n        232\n        112\n\n   Let's break it down:\n\n   Subjects: \n      Subject0: [2,2,1] -> max = '2'\n      Subject1: [2,3,1] -> max = '3'\n      Subject2: [3,2,2] -> max = '3'\n\n   Now, for each student:\n      Student0: ['2','2','3'] -> Check: \n          Subject0: 2 == max0 (2) -> yes, so this student is best in subject0.\n          Subject1: 2 != 3 -> no\n          Subject2: 3 == 3 -> yes\n          So student0 is successful because at least one (actually two) subject.\n\n      Student1: ['2','3','2'] -> \n          Subject0: 2==2 -> yes\n          Subject1: 3==3 -> yes\n          Subject2: 2!=3 -> no\n          Successful.\n\n      Student2: ['1','1','2'] ->\n          Subject0: 1 !=2 -> no\n          Subject1: 1 !=3 -> no\n          Subject2: 2 !=3 -> no\n          Not successful.\n\n   So output 2.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read the first line to get n and m.\n   Then, read the next n lines.\n\n   We can store the marks as a list of strings (each string is a row).\n\n   Then, we can create a list `max_marks` of length m (for each subject) where:\n        max_marks[j] = max( row[j] for each row in the list )\n\n   But note: the rows are strings. We can either work with characters or integers. Since the marks are digits, we can compare the characters directly because '1' < '2' etc.\n\n   Then, for each student i (each row in our list of strings), we can look at each subject j and check if the student's mark in that subject (row[i][j]) is equal to max_marks[j]. If at least one subject j satisfies this, then student i is successful.\n\n   However, note: what if we have two different maximums? The condition is just equality to the maximum.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        successful = 0\n        for each student i (from 0 to n-1):\n            found = False\n            for each subject j (from 0 to m-1):\n                if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                    found = True\n                    break   # no need to check further subjects for this student\n            if found:\n                successful += 1\n\n   But wait: is it correct to break? Yes, because we only need one subject in which the student is best.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require breaking, but breaking is more efficient.\n\n   But note: the problem constraints are small (n, m <= 100), so even",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their marks in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject, meaning no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves analyzing a gradebook where each student's marks across multiple subjects are given. For each subject, we need to find the highest mark achieved by any student. A student is successful if their mark in any subject matches this highest mark.\n2. **Intuition**: For each subject, identify the maximum mark. Then, for each student, check if they have achieved this maximum mark in any subject. If they have, they are counted as successful.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Read the input values for the number of students (n) and subjects (m).\n   - Read the gradebook data, which consists of n strings each containing m digits.\n   - For each subject, compute the maximum mark by examining the corresponding column in the gradebook.\n   - For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in any subject. If yes, increment the count of successful students.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves two main steps: computing the maximum marks for each subject (O(n*m)) and checking each student against these maxima (O(n*m)). The overall complexity is O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    n = int(first_line[0])\n    m = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    gradebook = []\n    for i in range(1, 1 + n):\n        gradebook.append(data[i].strip())\n        \n    max_marks = [0] * m\n    for j in range(m):\n        col_max = '0'\n        for i in range(n):\n            if gradebook[i][j] > col_max:\n                col_max = gradebook[i][j]\n        max_marks[j] = col_max\n        \n    count_successful = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        found = False\n        for j in range(m):\n            if gradebook[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            count_successful += 1\n            \n    print(count_successful)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. The first line contains the number of students (n) and subjects (m). Subsequent lines contain the gradebook entries for each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), the highest mark is determined by scanning all student entries for that subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: Each student is checked against these maximum marks. If a student's mark in any subject matches the highest mark for that subject, they are marked as successful.\n4. **Output Result**: The total count of successful students is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each student's performance across all subjects to determine their success based on the problem's criteria. The solution handles all edge cases, including scenarios where multiple students share the highest mark in a subject.",
