Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers A, B, C, D (with 1<=A<=B<=C<=D<=500000) and we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles (x,y,z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nThe triangle condition for sides (x,y,z) is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. However, note that we have fixed ordering: \n   x <= y <= z.\n\nIn a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the only condition we need to check is: x + y > z.\n\nBut note: our sides are constrained by ranges: x from [A, B], y from [B, C], z from [C, D].\n\nWe can break down the problem:\n\nLet x, y, z be integers with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D, and we require x+y>z.\n\nWe can iterate over x and y, but the ranges can be up to 500000, so iterating over all x and y (which would be about 500000*500000 operations) is too slow.\n\nInstead, we can fix x and then consider the constraints on y and z.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix y and z and then count the x's? But note the condition x+y>z, which can be rewritten as x > z - y.\n\nBut note: x is at most B, and also at least A. So for fixed y and z, x must be in the interval [max(A, z-y+1), B] (if z-y+1 <= B, otherwise no x). Then we can sum over y and z.\n\nHowever, the range for y is [B, C] and for z is [C, D]. The total pairs (y,z) is (C-B+1)*(D-C+1) which might be around 500000*500000 in worst-case (if B=C and C=D, then about 500000^2 which is 250e9, too many).\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAnother idea: fix the side z (the largest side). Then we need to count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y > z, and x in [A,B], y in [B,C].\n\nBut note: we also have the condition that y <= C (already given) and z>=C (given). Also, since x<=y<=z, we have x+y>z.\n\nNow, for a fixed z (from C to D), we need to count the pairs (x,y) with:\n   A<=x<=B, B<=y<=min(C, z)   [but note: we are given that y<=C and z>=C, so actually y from B to min(C, z) is just from B to C? Not exactly: but wait, we have y<=C and y<=z? Actually, no: the condition is y<=C and z>=C, but note that z can be larger than C. However, the constraint is that y<=C and also the triangle condition requires x+y>z. Since z>=C and y<=C, if z>y then we require x>z-y. But note: the triangle condition is independent of the ordering.\n\nBut note: the problem states: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D.\n\nSo y is at most C, and z is at least C. Therefore, for a fixed z, the condition is: x+y>z, and we have x in [A, B] and y in [B, C]. However, note that for a fixed z, we must have y <= C and also note that if z is very large (like D) then even the maximum y (C) and maximum x (B) must satisfy B+C > z. So for z >= B+C, there are no triangles.\n\nBut note: we also have the constraint that x<=y<=z, but actually the problem does not require the triangle to be strictly increasing? The input conditions are A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D, so the sides are in non-decreasing order.\n\nNow, we can try to fix z from C to D, and then for each z, count the pairs (x,y) such that:\n   x in [A, B]\n   y in [B, C]\n   and x+y > z.\n\nBut note: we cannot simply iterate over z from C to D because D can be up to 500000, and for each z we do an iteration over y from B to C (which is up to 500000) and then x from A to B (another 500000) which is O(D-C+1) * (C-B+1)*(B-A+1) -> worst-case 500000 * 500000 * 500000 which is 125e15, too slow.\n\nWe need to precompute or use cumulative sums.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nTotal number of triples (without the triangle condition) is: (B-A+1) * (C-B+1) * (D-C+1). But we need to subtract the ones that are degenerate or non-triangle.\n\nBut the condition is x+y>z. We can use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut note: the condition is on three variables. Another standard method for counting triangles with integer sides and bounded ranges is to use two pointers or cumulative sums.\n\nLet me reframe:\n\nWe want to count: \n   Sum_{x=A}^{B} Sum_{y=B}^{C} Sum_{z=C}^{D} [x+y>z]\n\nBut note that for fixed x and y, z must be in [max(C, something), D] and also z < x+y.\n\nActually, for fixed x and y, the condition is z < x+y. And we require z>=C and z<=D, so the valid z for fixed (x,y) is from C to min(D, x+y-1). \n\nThen we can write:\n   Count = Sum_{x=A}^{B} Sum_{y=B}^{C} max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1)\n\nBut then we are still iterating over x and y, which is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which can be up to 500000*500000 = 250e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\nWe need to optimize further.\n\nLet me change the order: fix y from B to C, and then for each y, we consider x from A to B. Then for each (x,y) we compute the number of z: from C to min(D, x+y-1). But again, we cannot iterate over all x and y.\n\nBut note: the inner part for fixed (x,y) is independent. However, the total pairs (x,y) is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1) which is too large.\n\nWe need to use mathematical aggregation.\n\nWe can fix the value of s = x+y. Then the condition is z < s, and s must be at least (minimum x+y) which is A+B (but note x>=A, y>=B, so minimum s is A+B) and at most B+C (since x<=B, y<=C).\n\nBut note: for each s, the pairs (x,y) that yield s are: \n   For a given s, x can vary from max(A, s-C) to min(B, s-B) [because y=s-x, and y must be in [B, C]].\n\nBut then we can iterate s from (A+B) to (B+C). Then for each s, the number of pairs (x,y) is:\n   Let x_min = max(A, s-C)\n   Let x_max = min(B, s-B)\n   Then the number of x is max(0, x_max - x_min + 1) provided that x_min <= x_max.\n\nThen, for each s, the condition for z is: z in [C, min(D, s-1)]. So the number of z for this s is max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1).\n\nThen the total count is: \n   Count = Sum_{s = A+B}^{B+C} [ (number of (x,y) with x+y=s) * (number of z for s) ]\n\nBut note: the condition on the triangle is independent for each s.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that the pairs (x,y) are in the allowed ranges. This method is acceptable because s runs from A+B to B+C, which is at most (B+C - (A+B) + 1) ~ 500000, which is acceptable.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Let s_min = A+B\n2. Let s_max = B+C\n\n3. Precompute for each s from s_min to s_max:\n   - The number of (x,y) pairs such that x+y = s, with x in [A, B] and y in [B, C].\n        Conditions: \n            x must be at least max(A, s-C) and at most min(B, s-B)\n        But note: since y = s-x, and y must be between B and C, we have:\n            s-C <= x <= s-B   [because y=s-x <= C => x>=s-C; y>=B => x<=s-B]\n        Also, x must be in [A, B]. So:\n            x_low = max(A, s-C, ?)   Actually, we have two constraints: x>=A, x>=s-C, and x<=B, x<=s-B.\n        So: \n            x_low = max(A, s-C)\n            x_high = min(B, s-B)\n\n        Then the count for s is: max(0, x_high - x_low + 1)   [if x_low <= x_high]\n\n4. For each s, the z must be in [C, min(D, s-1)] (if s-1 >= C, else 0). So the count of z is: max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n\n5. Then the contribution of s is: (count of (x,y) for s) * (count of z for s)\n\n6. Sum over s from s_min to s_max.\n\nBut note: we must consider that s_min might be less than or equal to s_max, and the same for the z condition.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the condition for z is that z>=C and z<=min(D, s-1). So if s-1 < C, then no z. But s_min = A+B, and A>=1, B>=A, so s_min>=2. But if s_min < C, then we might get negative counts? Actually, the z condition requires s-1>=C, i.e., s>=C+1. So for s from max(s_min, C+1) to s_max, we have positive z count.\n\nBut note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, and z>=C. So if x+y<=C, then no z (since z>=C and then x+y<=C<=z, so condition fails). But in our formulation, we are counting z from C to min(D, s-1). So if s-1 < C, then we set the z count to 0.\n\nBut note: s_min = A+B. Since A<=B<=C, we have A+B <= B+B <= C (if B<=C, then B+B<=C? Not necessarily. Example: A=1, B=2, C=3, then A+B=3 which is <= C=3. So s_min=3, and then for s=3, the z condition: min(D,2) - C + 1 = 2-3+1 = 0. So that's okay.\n\nBut wait: what if s_min is less than C? Then we start counting from s_min, but for s_min to s_max, the z count is 0 until s_min reaches C+1? Actually, we must start counting only when s-1 >= C, i.e., s>=C+1.\n\nBut note: the condition for z is that z>=C and z<=min(D, s-1). So if s-1 < C, then the interval [C, min(D, s-1)] is empty. Therefore, we can let:\n\n   z_count(s) = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n\nBut note: if s-1 < C, then min(D, s-1) < C, so the subtraction gives negative, then we take max(0, ...) so it becomes 0.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\n   s_min = A+B\n   s_max = B+C\n\n   total = 0\n   for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n        # Count the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y = s, x in [A,B], y in [B,C]\n        x_low = max(A, s - C)   # because y = s-x <= C  => x>=s-C\n        x_high = min(B, s - B)   # because y = s-x >= B => x<=s-B\n\n        # But note: the above two conditions are necessary for y to be in [B, C]. However, we must also ensure that x is at least A and at most B, but we already used A and B in x_low and x_high.\n\n        if x_low <= x_high:\n            count_xy = x_high - x_low + 1\n        else:\n            count_xy = 0\n\n        # Now, the z condition: z in [C, min(D, s-1)]\n        if s-1 < C:\n            count_z = 0\n        else:\n            upper_z = min(D, s-1)\n            count_z = upper_z - C + 1\n\n        total += count_xy * count_z\n\n   print(total)\n\nBut wait: is this correct?\n\nLet me test with the example: \"1 2 3 4\"\n\nInput: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nThen s_min = 1+2 = 3, s_max = 2+3 = 5.\n\ns=3:\n   x_low = max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1\n   x_high = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n   count_xy = 1 (x=1, then y=2) -> but wait, y=2, but note: y must be in [B, C] i.e., [2,3]. So y=2 is valid.\n   Then z: s-1=2, which is < C (3) -> count_z=0.\n\ns=4:\n   x_low = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n   x_high = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n   Then x can be 1 or 2.\n      If x=1, y=3 -> valid (y=3 is in [2,3])\n      If x=2, y=2 -> valid (y=2 is in [2,3])\n   So count_xy=2.\n   Then z: s-1=3, so z from 3 to min(4,3) -> z=3. count_z=1.\n   Contribution: 2*1 = 2.\n\ns=5:\n   x_low = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n   x_high = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2\n   Then x=2, y=3 -> valid.\n   count_xy=1.\n   Then z: s-1=4, so z from 3 to min(4,4) -> z=3,4 -> count_z=2.\n   Contribution: 1*2 = 2.\n\nTotal = 0 (for s=3) + 2 (s=4) + 2 (s=5) = 4.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nAnother example: \"1 2 2 5\"\n\nInput: A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nThen s_min=1+2=3, s_max=2+2=4.\n\ns=3:\n   x_low = max(1,3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n   x_high = min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1 -> count_xy=1 (x=1, y=2)\n   Then z: s-1=2, which is < C (which is 2) -> wait, condition: z in [2, min(5,2)] -> so [2,2] -> count_z=1.\n   But wait: condition for z is z>=C (which is 2) and z<=min(5,2)=2. So yes, one z.\n   However, the triangle condition: x+y>z -> 1+2>2 -> 3>2 -> true.\n   So should we count this? Then the example output is 3.\n\nBut according to our code: for s=3, count_xy=1, count_z=1 -> 1.\n\ns=4:\n   x_low = max(1,4-2)=max(1,2)=2\n   x_high = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2 -> count_xy=1 (x=2, y=2)\n   Then z: s-1=3, so z from 2 to min(5,3)=3 -> count_z=2 (z=2,3)\n   Then 1*2=2.\n\nTotal=1+2=3, which matches.\n\nBut wait, the example says: (1,2,2), (2,2,2), (2,2,3). Our s=3: (1,2,2) and (2,2,2) and (2,2,3) are accounted for?\nActually, s=3: (1,2,2) -> triangle condition holds: 1+2>2 -> 3>2 -> valid. But wait, (1,2,2): is that valid? \n   The sides are 1,2,2. Then 1+2>2 -> 3>2, 1+2>2 -> same, 2+2>1 -> 4>1. So yes.\n\nBut in our breakdown by s:\n   (1,2,2): s=3 -> counted in s=3 with z=2.\n   (2,2,2): s=4 -> counted in s=4 with z=2 and z=3? Actually, for (2,2,2): s=4, and z=2 -> then s=4, z=2: condition 4>2 -> valid. But wait, we have two z for s=4: z=2 and z=3. So (2,2,2) and (2,2,3) are both included.\n\nBut note: in s=3, we have (1,2,2) and then in s=4, we have (2,2,2) and (2,2,3). So total 3.\n\nWait, but why did we get 3? Our calculation: s=3: 1*1 = 1, s=4: 1*2 = 2, total 3.\n\nBut wait, the example says 3. However, the example input was \"1 2 2 5\", and we got 3.\n\nBut the example output was 3, so that's correct.\n\nBut note: in the example, the condition for y is [B, C] i.e., [2,2] (so y must be 2). Then for x: [1,2]. Then the triples are:\n   x=1, y=2, z from 2 to min(5, 1+2-1)=min(5,2)=2 -> one triple: (1,2,2)\n   x=2, y=2, z from 2 to min(5, 2+2-1)=min(5,3)=3 -> two triples: (2,2,2) and (2,2,3)\n\nTotal 3.\n\nBut wait, in our code for s=3: we considered (1,2) and then z=2. But note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, and here 1+2>2 -> 3>2, so yes.\n\nBut note: our code counts the same as the direct method.\n\nHowever, the example \"500000 500000 500000 500000\" gives 1.\n\nLet's test with A=B=C=D=500000.\n\nThen s_min = 500000+500000 = 1000000\ns_max = 500000+500000 = 1000000.\n\nFor s=1000000:\n   x_low = max(500000, 1000000-500000)=max(500000,500000)=500000\n   x_high = min(500000, 1000000-500000)=min(500000,500000)=500000\n   count_xy=1\n\n   Then z: from 500000 to min(500000,1000000-1)=500000, so count_z=1.\n\n   Total=1.\n\nBut wait, the triangle condition: x+y>z -> 500000+500000>500000 -> 1000000>500000 -> true.\n\nBut note: the triple (500000,500000,500000) is the only one.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut note: the range of s is from A+B to B+C, which in worst-case is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1). Since A<=B<=C, then C-A+1 can be up to 500000 (if A=1 and C=500000, then 500000). So we are iterating over 500000 values of s, which is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the constraints say that A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, so the range of s is (A+B) to (B+C) which is (A+B) to (B+C). The length of this interval is (B+C) - (A+B) + 1 = (C-A+1). In worst-case, if A=1, C=500000, then 500000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious because the computation per s is O(1). So the overall time complexity is O(C-A+1) which is O(500000) and that's acceptable.\n\nBut wait: what if A is large and C is small? Then the range might be negative? No, because A<=B<=C, so A+B <= B+B <= C (if B<=C) is not necessarily true, but we have s_min=A+B, s_max=B+C, and since A<=B<=C, then A+B <= B+B <= C? Only if B+B <= C, but if B+C is the maximum, then s_min=A+B and s_max=B+C, and A+B <= B+C is always true because A<=C.\n\nBut note: if A>B, but the input condition is A<=B, so we don't have to worry.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the four integers.\n\nBut note: the input may have multiple lines? The example input has three lines: ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000'].\n\nBut the problem says: the first line contains four integers.\n\nSo we read one line.\n\nCode:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    s_min = A + B\n    s_max = B + C\n    \n    total = 0\n    # We'll iterate s from s_min to s_max\n    # But note: if s_min > s_max, then there are no pairs. However, since A<=B<=C, then A+B <= B+B <= C (if B<=C) but wait, if B+C < A+B? That cannot happen because C>=B, so B+C>=A+B.\n\n    for s in range(s_min, s_max+1):\n        # Condition for x: x in [A, B] and y = s-x in [B, C]\n        x_low = max(A, s - C)\n        x_high = min(B, s - B)\n        \n        if x_low <= x_high:\n            count_xy = x_high - x_low + 1\n        else:\n            count_xy = 0\n            \n        # Condition for z: z in [C, min(D, s-1)]\n        if s-1 < C:\n            count_z = 0\n        else:\n            upper_z = min(D, s-1)\n            count_z = upper_z - C + 1\n            \n        total += count_xy * count_z\n        \n    print(total)\n\nBut wait: is the condition for y correct? We require y to be at least B and at most C. We derived:\n   y = s - x, so we require B <= s-x <= C.\n   => s-C <= x <= s-B.\n\nBut we also require x to be in [A, B]. So x must be in the intersection [A, B] ∩ [s-C, s-B].\n\nThat is what we did.\n\nBut note: the condition for y is automatically satisfied if x is in [s-C, s-B] and x is in [A, B]? Yes.\n\nHowever, we must note that the condition for y is independent: we require y in [B, C]. But by setting x in [s-C, s-B] we are ensuring that y is in [B, C]. \n\nBut wait, what if s-C < A and s-B > B? Then we are taking the intersection. This is correct.\n\nBut note: the example \"1 2 2 5\": \n   s=3: x_low = max(1, 3-2)=1, x_high = min(2, 3-2)=1 -> correct.\n\nBut consider a different example: A=2, B=3, C=4, D=5.\n\nLet s=5: \n   x_low = max(2,5-4)=max(2,1)=2\n   x_high = min(3,5-3)=min(3,2)=2 -> so x=2, then y=3, which is in [3,4] -> valid.\n\nBut what if s=6?\n   x_low = max(2,6-4)=max(2,2)=2\n   x_high = min(3,6-3)=min(3,3)=3 -> so x can be 2 or 3.\n        x=2 -> y=4 -> valid (y=4 in [3,4])\n        x=3 -> y=3 -> valid (y=3 in [3,4])\n   Then count_xy=2.\n\nThen z: s=6, so z from 4 to min(5,5) -> 4 to 5, so two z.\n\nThen total for s=6: 2*2=4.\n\nNow, let's list them:\n   (2,4,4): 2+4>4 -> 6>4 -> valid.\n   (2,4,5): 2+4>5 -> 6>5 -> valid.\n   (3,3,4): 3+3>4 -> 6>4 -> valid.\n   (3,3,5): 3+3>5 -> 6>5 -> valid.\n\nSo 4 is correct.\n\nBut wait, the total without the triangle condition would be (B-A+1)=2, (C-B+1)=1, (D-C+1)=2 -> 2*1*2=4. Then we subtract the non-triangle ones? None, so 4.\n\nBut wait, the condition x<=y<=z is enforced by the ranges: x in [2,3], y in [3,4], z in [4,5]. Then the pairs (x,y,z) are:\n   (2,3,4): 2+3=5>4 -> valid.\n   (2,3,5): 2+3=5>5 -> no (degenerate? actually 5==5, so not strict). But wait, the condition is x+y>z, so 5>5 is false.\n   (2,4,4): valid.\n   (2,4,5): valid.\n   (3,3,4): valid.\n   (3,3,5): valid.\n   (3,4,4): invalid because y must be in [3,4] but x=3 and y=4: then the triple is (3,4,4). But wait, the condition is A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. Here, x=3, y=4: then 3<=4, so that's okay. But wait, we didn't consider (3,4,4) and (3,4,5) in our s breakdown?\n\nWait, how did we get s? \n   For (3,4,4): s=3+4=7, which is beyond s_max=3+4=7? Actually, s_min=2+3=5, s_max=3+4=7.\n\nBut in our loop, we go from s=5 to s=7.\n\nFor s=7:\n   x_low = max(2,7-4)=max(2,3)=3\n   x_high = min(3,7-3)=min(3,4)=3 -> x=3, y=4 -> valid.\n   Then z: s=7, so z from 4 to min(5,6)=5 -> two z: 4 and 5.\n   Then (3,4,4) and (3,4,5) are included.\n\nBut wait, (3,4,4): 3+4>4 -> 7>4 -> valid.\n        (3,4,5): 3+4>5 -> 7>5 -> valid.\n\nBut then we have 8 triples? \n\nLet me list all:\n\nWithout the triangle condition, the triples are:\n   (2,3,4): 2+3>4 -> 5>4 -> valid.\n   (2,3,5): 5>5 -> invalid.\n   (2,4,4): valid.\n   (2,4,5): valid.\n   (3,3,4): valid.\n   (3,3,5): valid.\n   (3,4,4): valid.\n   (3,4,5): valid.\n\nSo 7 valid triples.\n\nBut wait, I thought we had 8? Actually, we have 8 without the triangle condition? Let's count the original set:\n\nx in [2,3]: 2,3 -> 2 values\ny in [3,4]: 3,4 -> 2 values\nz in [4,5]: 4,5 -> 2 values\n\nTotal 2*2*2=8.\n\nNow, which one is invalid? (2,3,5): 2+3=5 which is not greater than 5 -> invalid.\n\nSo we have 7 valid.\n\nBut our code for s=5,6,7:\n\ns=5:\n   x_low = max(2,5-4)=2, x_high=min(3,5-3)=min(3,2)=2 -> count_xy=1 (x=2,y=3)\n   z: s=5, so z from 4 to min(5,4)=4 -> count_z=1 (z=4)\n   Then (2,3,4) -> valid.\n\ns=6:\n   x_low = max(2,6-4)=2, x_high=min(3,6-3)=3 -> count_xy=2 (x=2,y=4; x=3,y=3)\n   z: s=6, so z from 4 to min(5,5)=5 -> count_z=2 (z=4,5)\n   Then two pairs: (2,4,4), (2,4,5) and (3,3,4), (3,3,5) -> four.\n\ns=7:\n   x_low = max(2,7-4)=3, x_high=min(3,7-3)=3 -> count_xy=1 (x=3,y=4)\n   z: s=7, so z from 4 to min(5,6)=5 -> count_z=2 (z=4,5)\n   Then two: (3,4,4) and (3,4,5)\n\nTotal: 1 (s=5) + 4 (s=6) + 2 (s=7) = 7.\n\nSo the code gives 7, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in our example above we thought we had 8 and then subtracted one invalid, so 7.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut note: the condition for y is [B, C] and we assumed that the pairs (x,y) must satisfy B<=y<=C. We did that by requiring x in [s-C, s-B] and then intersecting with [A, B]. This is correct.\n\nHowever, note that the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, and we are counting by s=x+y. This is the entire set.\n\nBut wait: is there any constraint that the sides must form a triangle? The problem states: non-degenerate triangle. The condition is x+y>z, and similarly the other two: x+z>y and y+z>x. But note that with x<=y<=z, the condition x+y>z implies the others? \n\nYes: \n   x+z >= x+y > z >= y (since z>=y) -> x+z>y (because x+y>z and z>=y, so x+z>=x+y>z>=y, so x+z>y)\n   Similarly, y+z >= y+x > z >= x -> y+z>x.\n\nSo the condition x+y>z is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut wait: what if x+y>z is not the only condition? Actually, no. With x<=y<=z, the triangle inequality reduces to x+y>z.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nHowever, note: the problem constraints are up to 500000, and we are iterating from s_min to s_max, which is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1). The worst-case is when A=1 and C=500000, so 500000 iterations. This is acceptable in Python if we do a simple loop.\n\nBut note: the example inputs have s_min and s_max that are close (like in the second example: 3 to 4, which is 2 iterations). The worst-case is 500000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\nLet me run the code with A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4 -> 4, which is correct.\n\nBut note: the example \"1 2 3 4\" is the first example.\n\nWe'll submit.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious of integer boundaries and performance.\n\nBut 500000 iterations is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what if A, B, C, D are 500000? Then s_min=1000000, s_max=1000000, so only one iteration.\n\nBut worst-case is when A=1, C=500000, then s_min=1+B, s_max=B+500000. Since B>=A=1, so s_min=2, s_max=500000+B. Then the range is from 2 to 500000+B, which is about 500000+B, and B is at most 500000, so the range is 500000+500000=1000000, which is 1000000 iterations. 1000000 is acceptable in Python.\n\nBut wait, the problem says A",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). The triangle must satisfy the condition \\(x + y > z\\) to be non-degenerate.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting all possible triples \\((x, y, z)\\) where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(z\\) ranges from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\). The key insight is that for each pair \\((x, y)\\), the condition \\(x + y > z\\) must hold for \\(z\\) in its range. \n\n2. **Key Insight**: Instead of iterating over all possible values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) (which would be computationally expensive), we can iterate over possible sums \\(s = x + y\\) and count the valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) that produce each sum \\(s\\). For each sum \\(s\\), the number of valid \\(z\\) values is determined by the range \\([C, \\min(D, s-1)]\\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Sum Iteration**: For each possible sum \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\), compute the number of valid pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y = s\\), \\(x \\in [A, B]\\), and \\(y \\in [B, C]\\).\n   - **Count Valid Z Values**: For each sum \\(s\\), the valid \\(z\\) values are those in the range \\([C, \\min(D, s-1)]\\). The count of these \\(z\\) values is added to the total if \\(s > C\\).\n   \n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm iterates over \\(O(C - A)\\) possible sums. Each iteration involves simple arithmetic operations, making the overall complexity \\(O(C - A)\\), which is efficient given the constraints \\(1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    s_min = A + B\n    s_max = B + C\n    \n    total = 0\n    for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n        x_low = max(A, s - C)\n        x_high = min(B, s - B)\n        \n        if x_low <= x_high:\n            count_xy = x_high - x_low + 1\n        else:\n            count_xy = 0\n            \n        if s - 1 < C:\n            count_z = 0\n        else:\n            upper_z = min(D, s - 1)\n            count_z = upper_z - C + 1\n            \n        total += count_xy * count_z\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) which define the ranges for the sides of the triangle.\n2. **Sum Range Calculation**: The minimum and maximum possible sums \\(s = x + y\\) are calculated as \\(A + B\\) and \\(B + C\\) respectively.\n3. **Iterating Over Sums**: For each sum \\(s\\) from \\(s_{\\text{min}}\\) to \\(s_{\\text{max}}\\):\n   - **Valid Pairs Calculation**: Determine the range of \\(x\\) values that satisfy \\(x \\in [A, B]\\) and \\(y = s - x \\in [B, C]\\). The number of valid \\(x\\) values is computed as `x_high - x_low + 1` if `x_low <= x_high`, otherwise 0.\n   - **Valid Z Count**: The number of valid \\(z\\) values is the count of integers from \\(C\\) to \\(\\min(D, s-1)\\), provided \\(s > C\\).\n4. **Result Calculation**: Multiply the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs by the number of valid \\(z\\) values for each sum \\(s\\) and accumulate the result.\n5. **Output**: Print the total count of valid non-degenerate triangles.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the problem by leveraging mathematical insights to avoid brute-force checks, ensuring optimal performance even for large input ranges.",
