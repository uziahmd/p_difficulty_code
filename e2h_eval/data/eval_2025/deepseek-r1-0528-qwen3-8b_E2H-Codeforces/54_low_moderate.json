Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n and a.\n We have a regular convex n-gon. The vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n We need to choose three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 (with v1 and v3 on its sides) is as close as possible to `a`.\n\n Note: In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n\n Observation:\n The angle at vertex v2 (the middle one) can be thought of as being formed by two sides: one from v2 to v1 and one from v2 to v3.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the three points to be consecutive. But in a regular polygon, the angle at a vertex is determined by the number of edges (or vertices) between the three.\n\n Actually, the problem is about forming an angle at v2 that is formed by two chords (from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3). The angle can be calculated using the inscribed angle theorem? Or we can use the following idea:\n\n In a regular polygon, the central angles are multiples of (360/n). The angle at a vertex (the interior angle) of the polygon is ((n-2)/n)*180, but that's for the polygon itself. However, we are allowed to pick any three distinct vertices.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Consider: the entire circle is 360 degrees. The polygon divides the circle into n equal arcs. The chord lengths and the angles formed by two chords from a common vertex (v2) can be related to the arcs they subtend.\n\n Specifically, if we fix vertex v2, then let the two other vertices be chosen such that there are i vertices to the left of v2 (in the clockwise direction) and j vertices to the right (or vice versa). But note: the polygon is cyclic.\n\n However, note: the angle we form must be measured in the interior or exterior? The problem states: \"the angle (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides)\".\n\n Since it's a convex polygon, the angle we form should be an interior angle? Actually, the problem says \"three distinct vertices\" and the angle is defined with v1 and v3 lying on the sides. But note: the example input \"4 67\" -> output \"2 1 3\": \n   For square (n=4): vertices 1,2,3. The angle at 2: \n        From 2, we go to 1 and to 3. In a square, the angle at vertex 2 (if we take the two adjacent vertices) is 90 degrees. But wait, the example output is \"2 1 3\", which uses two adjacent vertices and one opposite? Actually, no: in a square, the vertices are 1,2,3,4 in order. Then 2 has neighbors 1 and 3? Actually, no: the square has four vertices. The example output is \"2 1 3\": so the angle at vertex 2 is formed by going to vertex 1 and vertex 3. But in the square, vertex 1 is adjacent and vertex 3 is also adjacent (if we consider the square as 1-2-3-4-1, then from vertex 2, the two adjacent are 1 and 3). So that is the interior angle? \n\n But wait, the example input \"4 68\": output \"4 1 2\". This is a different set: vertex 4, and then 1 and 2. In the square, from vertex 4, the two adjacent are 3 and 1. Why 1 and 2? Then the angle would be formed by going from 4 to 1 and from 4 to 2. This is not the interior angle of the square (which is 90 degrees) but an angle that is actually 45 degrees (since from vertex 4, the chord to 1 is one edge, and the chord to 2 is skipping one vertex, so the arc from 4 to 2 is two edges, and the chord length corresponds to two edges).\n\n How do we compute the angle?\n\n There is a known formula for the angle formed by two chords from a common point (vertex) on a circle (circumcircle of the polygon) in terms of the arcs.\n\n The formula: the measure of the angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point inside the circle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs? But wait, our angle is at the circumference? Actually, the angle is at the vertex (which is on the circumference) and the two sides are chords. This is an inscribed angle? Actually, no: because the vertex is on the circle and the",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex by the other two vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently checking potential angles without resorting to brute-force methods.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that in a regular convex n-gon, the angle formed by three vertices can be determined by the number of edges between them. The central angle between adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees. The angle at a vertex (v2) formed by two other vertices (v1 and v3) can be calculated based on the arcs between these vertices.\n2. **Geometric Insight**: The angle at vertex v2 is influenced by the positions of v1 and v3. Specifically, if v1 and v3 are separated by `k` edges from v2, the angle can be derived from the circle's geometry. The angle is minimized when the arcs between v2 and the other two vertices are balanced.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of checking all possible triplets (which is computationally expensive for large n), we consider angles formed by vertices that are symmetric around the polygon. For each possible vertex v2, we check angles formed by vertices at distances `d` and `n-d-2` edges away, ensuring the angle is as close as possible to `a`.\n4. **Optimization**: By iterating over possible distances `d` and calculating the corresponding angles, we can efficiently find the triplet that minimizes the difference between the formed angle and `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n    \n    if n == 3:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n        \n    total_angle = 360.0\n    central_angle = total_angle / n\n    \n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_vertices = None\n    \n    for d in range(1, (n+1)//2 + 1):\n        if d == n//2 and n % 2 == 0:\n            left_count = d\n            right_count = d\n        else:\n            left_count = d\n            right_count = n - d - 1\n            \n        angle1 = 180 - (central_angle * left_count)\n        angle2 = 180 - (central_angle * right_count)\n        \n        current_angle = min(angle1, angle2)\n        diff = abs(current_angle - a)\n        \n        if diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_vertices = [d+1, 1, n-d] if d != n-d-1 else [d+1, 1, d+2]\n            \n        if d == n-d-1 and n % 2 == 1:\n            break\n            \n    if best_vertices is None:\n        best_vertices = [1, 2, 3]\n        \n    print(f\"{best_vertices[0]} {best_vertices[1]} {best_vertices[2]}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers, `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If the polygon is a triangle (n=3), the only possible angle is 60 degrees, so the solution directly outputs the three vertices.\n3. **Central Angle Calculation**: The central angle between adjacent vertices is computed as `360/n`.\n4. **Iterating Over Distances**: For each possible distance `d` from the vertex v2, the code calculates the angles formed by vertices at distances `d` and `n-d-1` from v2. The angle is derived from the formula `180 - (central_angle * d)`.\n5. **Finding Optimal Angle**: The code checks if the computed angle is closer to `a` than any previously found angle. If so, it updates the best solution.\n6. **Output**: The best triplet of vertices is printed. The vertices are numbered starting from 1, and the solution ensures the angle is as close as possible to `a`.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using geometric properties, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `n`.",
