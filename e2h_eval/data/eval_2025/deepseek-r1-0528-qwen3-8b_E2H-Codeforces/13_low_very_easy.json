For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string of 3 notes separated by spaces. The notes are from the set: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n Since the circle is cyclic and we have 12 notes, we can map each note to a number (0 to 11) and then compute the distances.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map each note to a number (index in the 12-note list).\n 2. Since the chord is unordered, we need to consider all cyclic permutations and orders? Actually, we can sort the three notes (by their index) and then consider the distances, but note that the circle wraps around.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\" for major.\n\n Important: the distance is measured from the lowest to the highest, and the scale is cyclic. But note: the example says the distance between E and C is 8 semitones (which is going up from E to F, F# to G, G# to A, A# to B, B to C? Actually, from E to C: \n   E -> F: 1, F->F#: 2, F#->G: 3, G->G#: 4, G#->A:5, A->A#:6, A#->B:7, B->C:8. So indeed 8 semitones.\n\n But wait: the problem states that the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one. However, when the chord is given as \"E C\", we cannot just take the absolute distance because the ordering must be from low to high. But the example input \"C E G\" is ordered as C, E, G.\n\n Approach:\n Let's assign numbers to the notes:\n\n notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n But wait, the example includes \"C# B F\", which is minor. Note that the example orders them as \"B C# F\": \n   B -> C#: 1 semitone (since B is 11, C# is 1 -> but we have to consider the circle)\n\n We can do:\n   Let base_note = the first note in the sorted list (by index) but then we have to account for the circularity.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider all 3! = 6 permutations and check for two conditions: \n   Condition for major: there exists an ordering (x, y, z) such that:\n        d(x,y) = 4 and d(y,z) = 3, and then d(x,z) should be 7 (if the chord is major). However, note the problem does not require the entire span, but the consecutive steps.\n\n But note: the definition says: \"If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones\"\n\n So, we are allowed to reorder arbitrarily. However, the ordering must be the natural order (lowest to highest) in the circle? Actually, the problem says \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". \n\n Important: the chord is defined by having the three notes. We can arrange the three notes in increasing order (in the cyclic 12-tone system) and then check the intervals.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Map the three input notes to their corresponding numbers (0 to 11).\n 2. Sort these numbers. Then, because it's a circle, we have to consider the gaps including the wrap-around.\n\n However, note: the problem says the distance from the lowest to the highest is measured in the direction of increasing tone. So we can arrange the three notes in increasing order (without wrapping) if we break the circle at the lowest note.\n\n But wait: the example \"C# B F\": \n   Notes: C# (1), B (11), F (5)\n   If we sort: [1, 5, 11] -> then the intervals are 5-1=4, 11-5=6 -> doesn't match 4 and 3.\n\n Alternatively, we can arrange the circle so that the chord is considered in the circular manner. However, the problem says \"from the lowest tone to the uppest one\", meaning we traverse the circle in the increasing direction until we complete the circle.\n\n Actually, the example reorders \"C# B F\" to \"B C# F\": \n   B (11) to C# (1): this is not a direct jump because ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking the intervals between the notes in all possible orders to see if they match the criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Numbers**: Each note is mapped to a number (0 to 11) based on its position in the 12-note chromatic scale.\n2. **Generating Permutations**: Since the chord is unordered, we consider all permutations of the three notes to explore every possible ordering.\n3. **Checking Intervals**: For each permutation, we calculate the distances between consecutive notes. A major chord requires a distance of 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones, while a minor chord requires 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones.\n4. **Handling Circular Scale**: The circular nature of the musical scale means that distances wrap around from H back to C. This is handled by considering the modulo 12 operation when calculating distances.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    notes_list = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_list)}\n    \n    input_str = input().strip()\n    parts = input_str.split()\n    if len(parts) != 3:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        indices = [note_to_index[note.strip()] for note in parts]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"strange\")\n        return\n        \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        a, b, c = perm\n        d_ab = (b - a) % 12\n        d_bc = (c - b) % 12\n        d_ca = (a - c) % 12\n        \n        total = (d_ab + d_bc + d_ca) % 12\n        if total != 12:\n            continue\n            \n        if d_ab == 4 and d_bc == 3:\n            found_major = True\n            \n        if d_ab == 3 and d_bc == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n            \n    if found_major and not found_minor:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor and not found_major:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The code starts by creating a list of the 12 musical notes and maps each note to its corresponding index (0 to 11).\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into three parts. Each part is checked to ensure it is a valid note.\n3. **Permutation Check**: For each permutation of the three note indices, the code calculates the distances between consecutive notes. The distances are computed using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Chord Classification**: The code checks if any permutation satisfies the interval conditions for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones). If only one condition is met, the corresponding chord type is printed; otherwise, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible orderings of the three notes to determine the chord type, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular musical scale. The solution ensures correctness by exhaustively verifying all permutations and their interval sequences.",
