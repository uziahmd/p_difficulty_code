Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given four integers A, B, C, D (with 1<=A<=B<=C<=D<=500000) and we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles (x,y,z) such that:\n   A <= x <= B, B <= y <= C, C <= z <= D.\n\nThe triangle condition for sides (x,y,z) is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. However, note that we have fixed ordering: \n   x <= y <= z.\n\nIn a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the only condition we need to check is: x + y > z.\n\nBut note: our sides are constrained by ranges: x from [A,B], y from [B,C], z from [C,D]. \n\nWe can rewrite the condition as:\n   x + y > z, with A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D.\n\nHow to count without iterating over all possibilities (which would be too slow because the ranges can go up to 500000)?\n\nWe can fix z (from C to D) and then for each z, determine the range of (x,y) such that x+y>z, and then count the pairs (x,y) in the given ranges.\n\nBut note: we also have constraints on x and y: x in [A, B] and y in [B, C]. Since x<=y and z>=y (because z>=C and y<=C, but actually note: the condition is x<=y<=z, so we have x<=y and y<=z? Actually, the problem says: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D. So indeed x<=y<=z.\n\nTherefore, for a fixed z (which is at least C and at most D), we require:\n   x in [max(A, z+1-y_max ???), wait let's reframe:\n\nActually, we can fix z and then the condition is: x+y > z, with x in [A, B] and y in [B, min(C, z)] (but note: y must be at most C, but also since z>=C, then y<=C and y<=z is automatically satisfied because y<=C<=z). So we can ignore the upper bound of y by C? Actually, no: the condition says y<=C, and since C<=z, then y<=C<=z, so the constraint on y is [B, C]. But note: we must also have x+y>z, and since x<=B and y<=C, if B+C <= z, then there are no solutions for this z. Otherwise, we have to count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z, with x in [A, B] and y in [B, C].\n\nAlternatively, we can fix x and y and then count the z such that z < x+y and z>=C, but then we have to be careful because we have an upper bound D.\n\nBut note: the ranges are independent and the total range for x is [A,B] (size at most 500000) and similarly for y and z. We cannot iterate over all x, y, z.\n\nLet me consider counting the total number of triples (without condition) and then subtract those that do not form a triangle? But the condition is x+y>z, and note that the other conditions (x+z>y and y+z>x) are automatically satisfied because:\n   x<=y<=z, so x+z >= x+y > z >= y -> x+z>y (since x+y>z and x>=1, then x+z>y is true because z>y? Actually, not necessarily: we know x+y>z, and we want to check x+z>y: since z>=y and x>=1, then x+z >= 1+y > y? Actually, 1+y > y is always true, but note: we have x>=A (which is at least 1) so yes, x+z>y is always true. Similarly, y+z>x is obvious because y>=B>=A>=x and z>=C>=B>=y, so y+z>=B+B>=2B>=B>=x? Not necessarily: what if x is large? Actually, the condition is x<=B and y>=B, so x<=B<=y, and then y+z >= y+B >= B+B>=B>=x? Wait, no: x can be as large as B, and y is at least B, so y+z >= B + C >= B + B = 2B. Now, if x<=B, then 2B >= B >= x? Actually, 2B>=B>=x is true, but note: we don't have the condition that 2B>=x necessarily, but since x<=B and 2B>=B>=x, yes. So indeed, the only condition we need is x+y>z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: count the number of triples (x,y,z) with:\n   A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C, C<=z<=D, and x+y>z.\n\nNow, we can fix x and y, then z must be in [C, min(D, x+y-1)] (because z must be at least C and less than x+y). Then the count for (x,y) is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1).\n\nBut then we have to iterate over x from A to B and y from B to C, and for each (x,y) compute the valid z's. The total number of (x,y) pairs is (B-A+1)*(C-B+1). In worst-case, A=1, B=500000, C=500000, so (500000)^2 which is 250e9, too many.\n\nWe need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, fix z and then count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y>z. Then the total is the sum over z from C to D of [count of (x,y) with x in [A,B], y in [B,C] and x+y>z].\n\nNow, how to count the pairs (x,y) with x+y>z for a fixed z?\n\nWe have x in [A, B] and y in [B, C]. We can precompute for each z, the condition is y > z - x.\n\nBut note: we can also think of it as: for a fixed z, we need to count the pairs (x,y) such that y > z - x, and x in [A, B] and y in [B, C].\n\nBut note: y has a lower bound of B and an upper bound of C. So for a fixed x, we require y > max(B-1, z-x) and y <= C. However, we must ensure that the lower bound for y is at least B, and the condition y>z-x might set a higher lower bound.\n\nActually, for a fixed x and z, the condition is y > z - x. But note: y must be at least B. So the condition becomes y > max(B-1, z-x) and y <= C.\n\nBut note: the condition is strict: y > z-x. So the smallest y that satisfies is floor(z-x)+1, but then we also require y>=B.\n\nSo the lower bound for y is L = max(B, floor(z-x)+1) and then we need to count the y in [L, C] (if L<=C).\n\nThen the count for fixed (x,z) is: max(0, C - L + 1) for each x.\n\nBut then we have to iterate over x from A to B for each z, and then over z from C to D. The total operations would be (D-C+1)*(B-A+1) which is about 500000*500000 = 250e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\nWe need to optimize further.\n\nAnother idea: Fix x and then the condition becomes y > z - x. Then for a fixed x, we want to count the pairs (y,z) such that y in [B, C] and z in [C, D] and y>z-x.\n\nBut note: the condition y>z-x can be rewritten as z < y+x.\n\nSo for fixed x and y, we have z < x+y and z>=C. So for fixed x and y, the z runs from C to min(D, x+y-1).\n\nBut then we are back to the same problem.\n\nAlternatively, we can fix the value of s = x+y, and then for each s (from minimum possible value to maximum), count the pairs (x,y) that give that s, and then for each s, the z can be from C to min(D, s-1). Then the contribution of s is (number of pairs (x,y) with x+y=s) * (max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)).\n\nBut note: the pairs (x,y) are constrained: x in [A,B] and y in [B,C]. The minimum s is A+B (if A<=B, then x=A, y=B) and the maximum s is B+C.\n\nHow to count the pairs (x,y) for a given s?\n\nWe need to count the pairs (x,y) such that x+y=s, A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C.\n\nThen y = s-x, and we require:\n   A<=x<=B, and B<=s-x<=C.\n\nWhich implies:\n   x>=A, x<=B, and s-C<=x<=s-B.\n\nSo x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] and also x must be at least ceil(s-C) and at most floor(s-B)? Actually, we have:\n   s-C <= x <= s-B.\n\nBut also x must be in [A, B]. So the valid x are in the interval [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)].\n\nThen the number of x is: max(0, min(B, s-B) - max(A, s-C) + 1) if the interval is non-empty.\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the lower bound is <= the upper bound.\n\nHowever, the total s runs from (A+B) to (B+C). The length of s is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1). This is at most 500000, so we can iterate s from (A+B) to (B+C).\n\nThen for each s, we compute the number of pairs (x,y) that yield s, and then multiply by the number of z (from C to min(D, s-1)).\n\nBut wait: we must also note that for a fixed s, the condition for z is z in [C, min(D, s-1)] (if s-1>=C, otherwise none).\n\nBut note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, which is equivalent to z < s. Since z is integer, z from C to s-1 (if s-1>=C). And we also have z<=D.\n\nSo the number of z for a fixed s is: max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1).\n\nThen the total count is:\n   total = 0\n   for s in range(min_s, max_s+1):\n        count_s = count_pairs(s)   # number of (x,y) pairs such that x+y=s, A<=x<=B, B<=y<=C.\n        count_z = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\n        total += count_s * count_z\n\nBut note: the pairs (x,y) are uniquely determined by s? Yes, because for each x in the interval [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] we get one y = s-x, and we must check that y is in [B, C]. But the condition we used for x ensures that y=s-x is in [B, C] because we required x<=s-B and x>=s-C.\n\nBut wait: the condition for y is B<=y<=C, and y=s-x. Then x<=s-B and x>=s-C. And we also have x>=A and x<=B.\n\nHowever, note: the interval for x is [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)]. Then the corresponding y = s-x is in [s-min(B,s-B), s-max(A,s-C)]? Actually, if x is increasing, y is decreasing.\n\nBut we defined the bounds for x so that y is between B and C. Let me check:\n\n   Condition: y = s-x >= B  => x <= s-B.\n   Condition: y = s-x <= C  => x >= s-C.\n\nAnd we also require x in [A, B]. So the x must be in [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)].\n\nBut note: the condition s-C <= x <= s-B must be satisfied, and then the y is in [B, C].\n\nHowever, we must also ensure that the computed x is an integer and that s-x is an integer (which it is). And that the x we choose leads to a y that is an integer and in [B,C]. Our bounds are set so that y is in [B,C].\n\nBut note: the bounds might not be integers? Actually, s, x, and y are integers.\n\nBut the problem: the interval [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] might be empty.\n\nNow, the total s runs from (A+B) to (B+C). The range of s is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1) which is at most 500000 (since A>=1, D<=500000, and A<=B<=C<=D, so C-A+1 <= 500000). So we can iterate over s from (A+B) to (B+C) and for each s, compute the count_s.\n\nBut wait: is the range of s really (A+B) to (B+C)? Actually, the minimum s is A+B (if we take x=A, y=B) and the maximum s is B+C (if we take x=B, y=C). So yes.\n\nBut note: the total number of s is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1). However, we must be cautious because the intervals for x might be empty for some s.\n\nNow, the algorithm:\n\nStep 1: Read A, B, C, D.\n\nStep 2: Set min_s = A+B, max_s = B+C.\n\nStep 3: Initialize total = 0.\n\nStep 4: For s from min_s to max_s:\n        low_x = max(A, s-C)\n        high_x = min(B, s-B)\n\n        If low_x <= high_x:\n            count_s = high_x - low_x + 1\n        Else:\n            count_s = 0\n\n        Then, the number of z for this s is: if s-1 >= C:\n            count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n        Else:\n            count_z = 0\n\n        Then, total += count_s * count_z\n\nStep 5: Print total.\n\nBut wait: is this correct?\n\nLet me test with the first example: \"1 2 3 4\"\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nmin_s = 1+2 = 3, max_s = 2+3 = 5.\n\ns=3: \n   low_x = max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1\n   high_x = min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n   count_s = 1 (x=1, then y=2, but wait: y=3-1=2, and y must be in [B,C]=[2,3] -> yes, but note: the condition for y is y>=B (which is 2) and y<=C (which is 3). So (1,2) is valid.\n   count_z: s-1=2, which is < C (which is 3) -> count_z=0.\n\ns=4:\n   low_x = max(1,4-3)=max(1,1)=1\n   high_x = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n   Then x can be 1 or 2.\n     x=1: y=3 -> valid (since y in [2,3])\n     x=2: y=2 -> valid (since y in [2,3])\n   count_s = 2.\n   count_z: s-1=3, so from C=3 to min(D=4,3) -> [3,3] -> count_z=1.\n   Contribution: 2 * 1 = 2.\n\ns=5:\n   low_x = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2\n   high_x = min(2,5-2)=min(2,3)=2\n   count_s=1 (x=2, y=3)\n   count_z: s-1=4, so from C=3 to min(D=4,4) -> [3,4] -> count_z=2.\n   Contribution: 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nTotal = 0 (for s=3) + 2 (for s=4) + 2 (for s=5) = 4.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nSecond example: \"1 2 2 5\"\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nmin_s = 1+2=3, max_s=2+2=4.\n\ns=3:\n   low_x = max(1, 3-2)=max(1,1)=1\n   high_x = min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1\n   count_s=1 (x=1, y=2)\n   count_z: s-1=2, which is >= C=2 -> count_z = min(5,2)-2+1 = 2-2+1=1.\n   Contribution: 1.\n\ns=4:\n   low_x = max(1,4-2)=max(1,2)=2\n   high_x = min(2,4-2)=min(2,2)=2\n   count_s=1 (x=2, y=2)\n   count_z: s-1=3 -> count_z = min(5,3)-2+1 = 3-2+1=2.\n   Contribution: 1*2=2.\n\nTotal=1+2=3.\n\nThird example: \"500000 500000 500000 500000\"\n\nA=B=C=D=500000.\n\nmin_s = 500000+500000 = 1000000, max_s=1000000.\n\ns=1000000:\n   low_x = max(500000, 1000000-500000)=max(500000,500000)=500000\n   high_x = min(500000,1000000-500000)=min(500000,500000)=500000\n   count_s=1.\n   count_z: s-1=999999, which is < C=500000? No, wait: C=500000, so condition: s-1>=C? 999999>=500000 -> yes.\n        Then count_z = min(500000,999999) - 500000 + 1 = 500000-500000+1=1.\n\n   Contribution: 1.\n\nTotal=1.\n\nBut wait: the example output is 1, so it matches.\n\nHowever, wait: the condition for z is that z must be at least C (which is 500000) and at most min(D, s-1). But s-1=999999, and D=500000, so we take min(500000,999999)=500000. Then the z must be in [500000,500000] -> one value.\n\nBut note: the triangle condition requires x+y>z. Here, x+y=1000000, and z=500000, so 1000000>500000 -> yes.\n\nBut wait: the sides are (500000,500000,500000). This is an equilateral triangle, which is non-degenerate.\n\nSo the code above seems to work.\n\nBut note: the ranges for s are from (A+B) to (B+C). The maximum value of s is B+C, and the minimum is A+B.\n\nHowever, note: the condition for the triangle is x+y>z, and we are counting for each s (the sum x+y) and then counting the z from C to min(D, s-1). This is correct.\n\nBut wait: is there a possibility that the same triangle is counted multiple times? No, because the triple (x,y,z) is uniquely defined by the three sides.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require distinct triangles? It just counts the number of triples (x,y,z) satisfying the conditions.\n\nBut wait: the condition on y is B<=y<=C, and note that the input says \"A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D\". So the sides are in non-decreasing order and we are iterating over s=x+y, and then z from C to min(D, s-1). This is correct.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious about the bounds for s. The minimum s is A+B and the maximum s is B+C. But note: is it possible that for a given s, the pairs (x,y) are such that y=C and x=s-C, but then s-C must be at least A and at most B? Our method already uses the bounds.\n\nBut note: the condition for y: y<=C, and we set x>=s-C. So if s-C is greater than B, then the interval [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] becomes [s-C, B] but s-C>B, then no solution. Similarly, if s-B < A, then no solution.\n\nBut the problem: the above loop runs from s_min to s_max, which is (A+B) to (B+C). The number of iterations is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1). Since A<=B<=C<=D and each is up to 500000, the maximum value for (C-A+1) is 500000, so 500000 iterations is acceptable.\n\nHowever, wait: the example inputs have A=1, B=500000, etc., but the range of s is from (A+B) to (B+C). In the worst-case, A=1, B=500000, C=500000, then s from 500001 to 1000000, which is 500000 numbers. That's acceptable.\n\nBut wait: if A=1, B=2, C=500000, then the range of s is from 3 to 500002, which is 500000 numbers. Still acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what if A=1, B=500000, C=500000? Then s from 500001 to 1000000, which is 500000 numbers. So the total number of s is (C-A+1) but note: the actual s_min is A+B and s_max is B+C, so the number of s is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1). And C-A+1 can be up to 500000.\n\nBut note: the constraints say A>=1, D<=500000, and A<=B<=C<=D, so C-A can be at most 500000-1=499999, so the number of s is at most 500000.\n\nBut wait: what if A=1, C=500000, then C-A+1=500000, and the s_min=1+B (where B>=A=1 and <=C=500000) and s_max=B+C (B<=500000, so s_max<=1000000). The number of s is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1) = 500000. So we are iterating 500000 times.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints say that A, B, C, D can be up to 500000, and we are iterating over s from (A+B) to (B+C). The length of this interval is (C-A+1). But note: (A+B) and (B+C) are consecutive? Actually, the length is (B+C - (A+B) + 1) = (C-A+1). So we are iterating (C-A+1) times, which is at most 500000.\n\nBut wait: what if A=1, B=500000, C=500000, then C-A+1=499999+1=500000, so we iterate 500000 times.\n\nSo the code is efficient.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the calculation of count_s for each s involves two min and max operations and then a subtraction. Then the calculation of count_z is a simple min and subtraction.\n\nSo the overall complexity is O(C-A+1) which is at most 500000.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\nEdge: when s-C > B or s-B < A, then count_s=0.\n\nBut note: the bounds for x are [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)]. If s-C > B, then the lower bound is s-C and s-C>B, so the interval is empty. Similarly, if s-B < A, then the upper bound is s-B and s-B<A, so the interval is empty.\n\nBut note: the condition for the existence of x is that s-C <= s-B (which is always true because C>=B) and then the interval [max(A, s-C), min(B, s-B)] is non-empty if and only if max(A, s-C) <= min(B, s-B).\n\nBut note: s-C <= s-B is true because C>=B. But we have to check that the interval [A, B] intersects [s-C, s-B]. \n\nBut our method is safe.\n\nCode:\n\nNote: We must use integer arithmetic.\n\nLet me code accordingly.\n\nHowever, note: the condition for count_z: \n   count_z = max(0, min(D, s-1) - C + 1)   if s-1 >= C, else 0.\n\nBut we can write it as:\n   if s-1 < C:\n        count_z = 0\n   else:\n        count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n\nBut note: if s-1 < C, then the lower bound C is greater than s-1, so no z.\n\nBut we can also write:\n\n   low_z = C\n   high_z = min(D, s-1)\n   if high_z < low_z:\n        count_z = 0\n   else:\n        count_z = high_z - low_z + 1\n\nBut the above is the same.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n   if s-1 < C:\n        count_z = 0\n   else:\n        count_z = min(D, s-1) - C + 1\n\nBut note: if s-1 >= D, then we use D, otherwise s-1.\n\nBut the above formula is correct.\n\nLet me code accordingly.\n\nBut wait: the example \"1 2 3 4\" had s=3: s-1=2 < C=3 -> count_z=0.\n\ns=4: s-1=3>=3 -> count_z= min(4,3)-3+1 = 3-3+1=1.\n\ns=5: s-1=4>=3 -> count_z= min(4,4)-3+1=4-3+1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let me run the provided examples.\n\nExample 1: Input \"1 2 3 4\" -> Output 4.\nExample 2: Input \"1 2 2 5\" -> Output 3.\nExample 3: Input \"500000 500000 500000 500000\" -> Output 1.\n\nBut wait, there is another example: \"1 2 2 5\", but the example input was given as a list of strings. We read from stdin.\n\nBut note: the problem says the input is four integers in one line.\n\nWe can read with:\n\n   data = input().split()\n   A = int(data[0]); B = int(data[1]); C = int(data[2]); D = int(data[3])\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nHowever, note: the constraints say that A, B, C, D can be as large as 500000, and the s_min = A+B, which can be as large as 1000000, and s_max = B+C, which can be 1000000. But the iteration from s_min to s_max is (C-A+1) which is at most 500000, so it's acceptable.\n\nBut wait: what if A=1, B=500000, C=500000, then s_min=500001, s_max=1000000, which is 500000 numbers. The code must be able to handle that.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints say that A, B, C, D are at least 1 and at most 500000, and A<=B<=C<=D, so the worst-case is when C-A is about 500000, so we iterate 500000 times, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that the input can be as large as 500000, but we are iterating only over (C-A+1) which is 500000, so it's acceptable.\n\nLet me test with a small example: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4 -> we did.\n\nBut wait: what if A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1?\n   Then min_s=2, max_s=2.\n   s=2: \n        low_x = max(1,2-1)=max(1,1)=1\n        high_x = min(1,2-1)=min(1,1)=1\n        count_s=1.\n        count_z: s-1=1, C=1 -> count_z = min(1,1)-1+1=1-1+1=1.\n        total=1.\n\nBut the triangle: (1,1,1) -> 1+1>1 -> 2>1 -> yes. So one triangle.\n\nBut the condition: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D: 1<=1<=1<=1<=1<=1<=1 -> holds.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nAnother test: A=1, B=3, C=3, D=4.\n\nmin_s=4, max_s=6.\n\ns=4: \n   low_x = max(1,4-3)=1, high_x=min(3,4-3)=1 -> count_s=1 (x=1, y=3)\n   count_z: s-1=3, C=3 -> count_z=min(4,3)-3+1=3-3+1=1.\n   total+=1.\n\ns=5:\n   low_x = max(1,5-3)=max(1,2)=2, high_x=min(3,5-3)=min(3,2)=2 -> count_s=1 (x=2, y=3)\n   count_z: s-1=4, count_z=min(4,4)-3+1=4-3+1=2.\n   total+=2.\n\ns=6:\n   low_x = max(1,6-3)=3, high_x=min(3,6-3)=3 -> count_s=1 (x=3, y=3)\n   count_z: s-1=5, count_z=min(4,5)-3+1=4-3+1=2.\n   total+=2.\n\nTotal=1+2+2=5.\n\nNow, let me enumerate the triangles:\n\nConditions: x in [1,3], y in [3,3] (so y=3), z in [3,4].\n\nTriangle condition: x+y>z -> x+3>z.\n\nPossible (x,y,z):\n\nx=1, y=3: then z must be <4 (because 1+3=4, so z<4 -> z=3). So (1,3,3) -> one.\n\nx=2, y=3: then z must be <5, so z can be 3 or 4 -> (2,3,3) and (2,3,4)\n\nx=3, y=3: then z must be <6, so z can be 3 or 4 -> (3,3,3) and (3,3,4)\n\nBut wait, we got 5 triangles: (1,3,3), (2,3,3), (2,3,4), (3,3,3), (3,3,4). \n\nBut the problem condition: A<=x<=B<=y<=C<=z<=D -> \n   x in [1,3], y in [3,3] (so fixed to 3), z in [3,4].\n\nSo we have:\n   (1,3,3) -> valid\n   (1,3,4) -> invalid because 1+3=4 which is not >4 -> degenerate? Actually, non-degenerate requires strict inequality. So (1,3,4) is degenerate? \n        Check: 1+3>4 -> 4>4 -> false. So (1,3,4) is not allowed.\n\nBut wait, in our calculation for s=4 (x+y=4) we only allowed z=3 (because z must be <= min(D,3)=3). So (1,3,4) is not included.\n\nSimilarly, for s=5 (x+y=5): z must be <=4 (because min(D,4)=4) and >=3, so z=3,4. But for x=2, y=3: 2+3=5, so z must be <5. So z=3 and 4 are both allowed? \n   z=3: 2+3>3 -> 5>3 -> yes.\n   z=4: 2+3>4 -> 5>4 -> yes.\n\nSimilarly, for s=6 (x+y=6): z must be <=4 (because min(D,5)=4) and >=3, so z=3,4. \n   For x=3,y=3: 3+3>3 -> 6>3 -> yes, and 3+3>4 -> 6>4 -> yes.\n\nSo the valid triangles are:\n   (1,3,3) -> 1+3>3 -> 4>3 -> yes.\n   (2,3,3) -> 5>3 -> yes.\n   (2,3,4) -> 5>4 -> yes.\n   (3,3,3) -> 6>3 -> yes.\n   (3,3,4) -> 6>4 -> yes.\n\nSo 5 triangles.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"non-degenerate\", and the condition for non-degenerate is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. In the triangle (1,3,4): \n   1+3=4 -> not greater, so degenerate. But (1,3,4) is not included because we only took z=3 for s=4.\n\nBut (3,3,4): \n   3+3>4 -> ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) such that \\(A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D\\). A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is strictly greater than the third side. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach is infeasible, so we need an optimized method.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation is that for a triangle with sides \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), the only condition to check is \\(x + y > z\\). The other conditions (\\(x + z > y\\) and \\(y + z > x\\)) are automatically satisfied because \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\) implies \\(x + z \\geq y + z > y \\geq x\\) and \\(y + z \\geq x + y > z \\geq y\\).\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each possible sum \\(s = x + y\\) (where \\(x\\) ranges from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) and \\(y\\) ranges from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\)), we determine the range of valid \\(z\\) values (from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\)) such that \\(z < s\\). The number of valid \\(z\\) values for each \\(s\\) is \\(\\max(0, \\min(D, s-1) - C + 1)\\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over all possible sums \\(s\\) from \\(A + B\\) to \\(B + C\\). For each \\(s\\), we count the number of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(x + y = s\\), \\(x \\in [A, B]\\), and \\(y \\in [B, C]\\). This count is derived by finding the intersection of the intervals \\([A, B]\\) and \\([s-C, s-B]\\). The total number of valid triangles is the sum over all \\(s\\) of the product of the count of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs and the count of valid \\(z\\) values.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in \\(O(C - A + 1)\\) time, which is efficient given the constraints (since \\(C - A + 1 \\leq 500,000\\)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    min_s = A + B\n    max_s = B + C\n    \n    total_triangles = 0\n    \n    for s in range(min_s, max_s + 1):\n        low_x = max(A, s - C)\n        high_x = min(B, s - B)\n        \n        if low_x <= high_x:\n            count_xy = high_x - low_x + 1\n        else:\n            count_xy = 0\n            \n        if s - 1 < C:\n            count_z = 0\n        else:\n            count_z = min(D, s - 1) - C + 1\n            \n        total_triangles += count_xy * count_z\n        \n    print(total_triangles)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of four integers \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) read from standard input.\n2. **Initial Setup**: Calculate the minimum and maximum possible sums \\(s\\) (i.e., \\(A + B\\) and \\(B + C\\)).\n3. **Iterate Over Sums**: For each sum \\(s\\) from \\(min_s\\) to \\(max_s\\):\n   - Determine the valid range of \\(x\\) values such that \\(x\\) is in \\([A, B]\\) and \\(y = s - x\\) is in \\([B, C]\\). This is done by setting `low_x` as the maximum of \\(A\\) and \\(s - C\\), and `high_x` as the minimum of \\(B\\) and \\(s - B\\).\n   - If there are valid \\(x\\) values (`low_x <= high_x`), compute the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs (`count_xy`).\n   - For each \\(s\\), compute the number of valid \\(z\\) values (from \\(C\\) to \\(\\min(D, s-1)\\)) if \\(s-1 \\geq C\\).\n4. **Accumulate Results**: Multiply the number of valid \\((x, y)\\) pairs by the number of valid \\(z\\) values for each \\(s\\) and accumulate the result.\n5. **Output**: Print the total number of non-degenerate triangles.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts all valid triangles by leveraging mathematical insights and careful range calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
