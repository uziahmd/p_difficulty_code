The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n (number of rounds, up to 2e9)\n   two strings A and B (each of length at most 1000, containing only 'R','S','P')\n\n We need to simulate n rounds. In each round i (0-indexed), \n   Nikephoros uses A[i % len(A)]\n   Polycarpus uses B[i % len(B)]\n\n But note: n can be up to 2e9, so we cannot iterate through each round.\n\n Instead, we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n 1. We note that the entire game is periodic with period LCM(len(A), len(B))? Actually, the state (i mod m, j mod k) repeats every L = LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\n However, note: the rounds are played sequentially. The i-th round uses:\n   a_i = A[i % m]\n   b_i = B[i % k]\n\n The total number of rounds is n. We can consider that the game goes for n rounds, and we want to count the total losses for each player.\n\n How?\n Let's define:\n   For a round i (0-indexed):\n      outcome = (A[i % m], B[i % k])\n\n There are three outcomes for a round:\n   - Draw: when A[i%m] == B[i%k] -> no red spot.\n   - Loss for Nikephoros: when (A[i%m], B[i%k]) is one of the losing cases for Nikephoror (so wins for Polycarpus). \n        According to the rules:\n            Rock beats Scissors -> if A has Rock and B has Scissors, then Nikephoros wins? Actually, wait:\n\n        The rules:\n          Rock beats Scissors.\n          Scissors beat Paper.\n          Paper beats Rock.\n\n        So for a round:\n          If A[i%m] is Rock and B[i%k] is Scissors -> A wins (so no red spot for Nikephoros, but red spot for Polycarpus? Actually, the loser gets the red spot. So if A wins, then B loses -> so Polycarpus gets a red spot.\n\n        Therefore:\n          - If A[i%m] beats B[i%k]: then Polycarpus loses and gets a red spot, and Nikephoros doesn't.\n          - If B[i%k] beats A[i%m]: then Nikephoros loses and gets a red spot, and Polycarpus doesn't.\n          - If they are the same: draw.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define:\n\n          loss_Nikephoros: when B[i%k] beats A[i%m]\n          loss_Polycarpus: when A[i%m] beats B[i%k]\n\n        And note: the other case is draw.\n\n        So we have:\n          outcome = (a, b)\n          if a == b: draw.\n          else if (a, b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] then a wins -> so Polycarpus loses (so loss for Polycarpus: count for Polycarpus's red spots increases by one) and vice versa for the other three.\n\n        Actually, the six non-draw combinations split into two sets of three.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute for each pair (x,y) whether x beats y.\n\n        We can define a function:\n\n          def beats(x, y):\n              # returns True if x beats y (so the round is won by the one who plays x, and the one who plays y loses)\n              # According to the rules: \n              #   Rock beats Scissors -> ('R','S') -> True\n              #   Scissors beats Paper -> ('S','P') -> True\n              #   Paper beats Rock -> ('P','R') -> True\n\n          Then:\n            if x == y: return None (draw)\n            elif beats(x,y): then x wins -> so the player who played x doesn't get a red spot, the one who played y does.\n            else: then y wins -> the player who played y doesn't, the one who played x does.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"the loser gets the red spot\". So:\n\n          In a round:\n            if A[i%m] beats B[i%k]: then Polycarpus (who played B[i%k]) loses -> red spot for Polycarpus.\n            if B[i%k] beats A[i%m]: then Nikephoros (who played A[i%m]) loses -> red spot for Nikephoros.\n\n        So we can define:\n\n          loss_Nike = 0\n          loss_Poly = 0\n\n        For each round i from 0 to n-1:\n          a = A[i % m]\n          b = B[i % k]\n\n          if a == b:\n              continue\n          elif (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              loss_Poly += 1\n          elif (b,a) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              loss_Nike += 1\n\n        However, note: the second condition is equivalent to (a,b) being one of the losing pairs for b? Actually, the set of winning pairs is symmetric.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          if (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n             # then a wins -> so b loses -> so Polycarpus loses (if b is from his sequence) but wait: actually, we don't know who is which?\n\n        But we know: \n          a is from A (Nikephoros)\n          b is from B (Polycarpus)\n\n        So:\n          if a beats b: then Polycarpus loses -> loss_Poly += 1\n          if b beats a: then Nikephoros loses -> loss_Nike += 1\n\n        We can define a helper function or use a dictionary or if-else.\n\n 2. Since n is huge, we cannot iterate over all rounds. We must use the periodicity.\n\n    The entire sequence of rounds is periodic with period T = LCM(m, k). \n\n    However, note: the round index i uses:\n        a_i = A[i % m]\n        b_i = B[i % k]\n\n    The state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds, because T is the least common multiple of m and k, so T is divisible by both m and k.\n\n    But note: the round index i runs from 0 to n-1, and we can break the n rounds into complete periods and a remainder.\n\n    Steps:\n\n      Step 1: Precompute the period T = LCM(m, k). But note: we don't need the LCM value directly. We need to consider the entire cycle of states (i mod m, i mod k) which has length T.\n\n      Step 2: We can compute the total red spots for one full period (T rounds) for both players.\n\n      Step 3: Then, the total red spots for n rounds would be:\n          full_cycles = n // T\n          remainder_rounds = n % T\n\n          total_loss_Nike = full_cycles * (losses per cycle for Nikephoros) + (additional losses in the first remainder_rounds)\n          total_loss_Poly = full_cycles * (losses per cycle for Polycarpus) + (additional losses in the first remainder_rounds)\n\n      Step 4: However, note: the period T might be very large (m,k <= 1000, so T <= 1000*1000 / gcd(m,k) which is at most 1000*1000 = 1e6, but 2e9 / 1e6 is about 2000 cycles, but wait: we cannot simulate 1e6 rounds per cycle because T might be as large as 1000*1000 (which is 1e6) and then n//T might be 2000, so we can precompute the cycle of T rounds? But T can be up to 1000*1000 (if m and k are coprime) which is 1e6, and then we can simulate one cycle by iterating over T rounds (which is 1e6) and then multiply by the number of cycles. But note: n can be 2e9, and T might be 1e6, so the number of cycles is 2e9 / 1e6 = 2000, and then we do 2000 * 1e6 = 2e9 operations, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python might be borderline in speed? However, note that T is the LCM(m,k) and the maximum m,k is 1000, so T <= 1000000 (one million). Then, the total number of rounds simulated in one cycle is T (which is up to 1e6) and then we have to do this for the full cycles? Actually, we don't need to simulate the entire cycle for each full_cycle, we can precompute the counts for one cycle and then multiply.\n\n      But wait: we can precompute the cycle by iterating over i from 0 to T-1 (since T is the period). Then we do:\n\n          losses_Nike_cycle = 0\n          losses_Poly_cycle = 0\n          for i in range(T):\n              a = A[i % m]\n              b = B[i % k]\n              if a == b:\n                  continue\n              elif (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                  losses_Poly_cycle += 1\n              elif (b,a) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                  losses_Nike_cycle += 1\n\n      Then, for n rounds:\n\n          cycles = n // T\n          remainder = n % T\n\n          losses_Nike_total = cycles * losses_Nike_cycle + (count of losses for Nikephoros in the first 'remainder' rounds)\n          losses_Poly_total = cycles * losses_Poly_cycle + (count of losses for Polycarpus in the first 'remainder' rounds)\n\n      Now, how to compute the counts for the remainder? We can simulate the first 'remainder' rounds (which is at most T-1, and T is at most 1e6, so remainder is < T, so we can iterate over remainder rounds).\n\n      However, note: T can be as large as 1000000, and then remainder is less than T, so we can do a loop of up to 1000000 for the remainder part. But then the total work would be:\n\n          Precomputation for cycle: T (which is 1e6) and then remainder: up to 1e6, so worst-case 2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n      But wait, what if m and k are not coprime? Then T = LCM(m,k) = (m*k) / GCD(m,k). The maximum value is still 1e6 (since m,k<=1000, so maximum LCM is 1000*1000=1e6, but actually the LCM of two numbers <=1000 is at most 1000*1000/1 (if they are coprime) so 1e6). So T is at most 1000000.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Read n, string A, string B.\n\n        m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\n        T = (m * k) // gcd(m, k)   [we need to compute gcd]\n\n        Then, we need to compute the cycle of T rounds (from round0 to round T-1) and then the next remainder rounds (from round T to round n-1, but we break the n rounds into cycles and remainder).\n\n        However, note: the period is T, so the entire sequence of rounds is periodic with period T. That is, the outcome of round i is the same as round i+T.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Compute T = lcm(m, k)\n\n          Precompute an array for one cycle (length T): \n            losses_Nike_cycle = 0\n            losses_Poly_cycle = 0\n\n          Then, for i in range(T):\n              a = A[i % m]\n              b = B[i % k]\n              if a == b:\n                  continue\n              elif (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                  losses_Poly_cycle += 1\n              elif (b,a) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                  losses_Nike_cycle += 1\n\n          Then, let full_cycles = n // T\n          remainder = n % T\n\n          Now, for the remainder part, we need to simulate from round 0 to round remainder-1 (because our cycle was defined for the first T rounds, and the remainder is the next 'remainder' rounds, which is from round T*full_cycles to round T*full_cycles+remainder-1). But note: the state for round i is determined by (i mod m, i mod k). \n\n          However, the cycle is defined by the modulus, so the remainder part is just the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle (from round0 to round remainder-1). Because the cycle repeats, and the state at round i is (i mod m, i mod k). \n\n          So we can simulate the first 'remainder' rounds (without the full cycle) and count:\n\n            additional_Nike = 0\n            additional_Poly = 0\n\n            for i in range(remainder):\n                a = A[i % m]\n                b = B[i % k]\n                if a == b:\n                    continue\n                elif (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    additional_Poly += 1\n                elif (b,a) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n                    additional_Nike += 1\n\n          Then, total_Nike = full_cycles * losses_Nike_cycle + additional_Nike\n          total_Poly = full_cycles * losses_Poly_cycle + additional_Poly\n\n        Print total_Nike and total_Poly.\n\n 3. But wait: what if the period is not exactly T? Actually, the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds, so the entire outcome (whether it's a win for A, a win for B, or a draw) will repeat every T rounds.\n\n    However, note: the outcomes are determined by the pair (A[i%m], B[i%k]). The state (i mod m, i mod k) is the same for i and i+T, so the outcome is the same.\n\n    Therefore, the above method is valid.\n\n 4. Implementation details:\n\n    - We need a function to compute gcd and then lcm.\n\n    Example: \n        Input: \n          7\n          RPS\n          RSPP\n\n        Here, n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        m=3, k=4 -> T = LCM(3,4)=12.\n\n        Then we break 7 rounds into 0 full cycles (since 7//12=0) and remainder=7.\n\n        Then we simulate the first 7 rounds (from i=0 to i=6) to count the losses.\n\n        Alternatively, we can also simulate the entire cycle (12 rounds) and then take the first 7? But note: the cycle is defined for 12 rounds, so the first 7 rounds are indeed the first 7.\n\n        Let's compute for the sample:\n\n          Round0: A[0]='R', B[0]='R' -> draw.\n          Round1: A[1]='P', B[1]='S' -> P vs S: P beats S? No, wait: the rule: \n                  Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock.\n                  So: P vs S -> S is Scissors, P is Paper -> Paper beats Rock? Actually, wait: the rule says Paper beats Rock, but here we have Paper and Scissors. \n                  According to the rule: Scissors beat Paper. So the outcome: \n                  (Paper, Scissors) -> Scissors beats Paper -> so the one who played Paper loses? \n\n          Actually, let me check the condition:\n\n          Condition for a wins: (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]\n          Condition for b wins: (b,a) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> which is equivalent to (a,b) in [('S','R'), ('P','S'), ('R','P')]\n\n          Alternatively, we can define the winning conditions for a:\n\n            a wins against b if:\n                (a == 'R' and b == 'S') OR\n                (a == 'S' and b == 'P') OR\n                (a == 'P' and b == 'R')\n\n          Similarly, b wins against a if:\n                (b == 'R' and a == 'S') OR\n                (b == 'S' and a == 'P') OR\n                (b == 'P' and a == 'R')\n\n          So for (a='P', b='S'): \n            a wins condition: ('P','R') -> not matching, but wait: the rule says Paper beats Rock, so if the opponent has Rock, then Paper wins. But here, b is Scissors, and the rule says Scissors beats Paper. So actually, the condition for a wins is (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. Here, (a='P', b='S') is not in that list, but (b='S', a='P') is in [('S','P')] (which is the second element) so that means b wins.\n\n          So we can re-write without using the tuple membership test by having:\n\n          if a == b:\n              continue\n          else if (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              # a wins -> so b loses (Polycarpus loses)\n          else if (b,a) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              # b wins -> so a loses (Nikephoros loses)\n\n        Alternatively, we can check:\n\n          if a == b: draw\n          elif (a,b) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              # then a wins -> loss for Polycarpus\n          else:\n              # then b wins -> loss for Nikephoros\n\n        Now, let's do the example:\n\n          Round0: (R,R) -> draw.\n          Round1: (P,S) -> (P,S) is not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so else: then (S,P) is in [('S','P')] -> wait, no: the condition for the else is (b,a) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. Here, (b,a) = (S,P) is in [('S','P')] -> so condition holds. So we count loss for Nikephoros? \n\n          But wait, the rule: Scissors beats Paper -> so the one who played Paper (Nikephoros) loses. So yes, this is correct.\n\n          Round2: (S,P) -> (S,P) is in [('S','P')] -> so a wins -> so Polycarpus loses.\n\n          Round3: (R,P) -> (R,P) -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] (because (R,P) is not there) -> so check (P,R) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> (P,R) is the third one -> so (b,a)=(P,R) is in the list -> so b wins -> so a (Nikephoros) loses.\n\n          Round4: (P,R) -> (P,R) is in the list -> a wins -> Polycarpus loses.\n\n          Round5: (S,S) -> draw.\n\n          Round6: (R,P) -> same as round3: (R,P) -> b wins -> loss for Nikephoros.\n\n          So for the first 7 rounds:\n\n            Round0: draw\n            Round1: loss_Nike +=1\n            Round2: loss_Poly +=1\n            Round3: loss_Nike +=1\n            Round4: loss_Poly +=1\n            Round5: draw\n            Round6: loss_Nike +=1\n\n          Total: loss_Nike = 3, loss_Poly = 2.\n\n        This matches the sample.\n\n 5.

Edge: n=0, then remainder=0, and full_cycles=0, so output (0,0). \n\n 7. Let's test with the provided example: n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n      m=3, k=4, g = gcd(3,4)=1, T=12.\n\n      Then we simulate 12 rounds for the cycle? Actually, we are only simulating the first 7 rounds for the remainder.\n\n      But wait, we did the simulation for the entire cycle (T=12) to get the cycle counts, but then we only use the first 7 for the remainder.\n\n      However, the cycle counts (losses_Nike_cycle, losses_Poly_cycle) are for the entire cycle (12 rounds). But then we break the 7 rounds into 0 cycles and 7 rounds, so we don't use the cycle counts at all? \n\n      Correction: We computed the cycle counts for 12 rounds, but then we are breaking n=7 as 0 full cycles and 7 remainder. So we only use the remainder simulation.\n\n      Why did we compute the cycle counts then? Actually, we don't need them for n=7 because full_cycles=0. But if n were 12, then we would use the cycle counts.\n\n      But wait: what if n=13? Then full_cycles=1, and remainder=1. Then we need the cycle counts for 12 rounds and then the first round of the next cycle (which is the same as round0) for the remainder.\n\n      However, the above code computes the cycle counts for T=12, which is the entire cycle, and then for the remainder we simulate from 0 to remainder-1 (which is 0 to 0, i.e., one round). But the cycle counts were computed for 12 rounds, and then we add the first round (which is the same as the first round of the cycle). \n\n      This is correct because the cycle is periodic and the remainder rounds are the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle.\n\n 8. However, note: the cycle T is defined as LCM(m,k). The state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T rounds. Therefore, the outcome of round i is the same as round i mod T (if we consider modulo T). But note: our simulation for the cycle is from i=0 to i=T-1. Then the remainder part is from i=0 to i=remainder-1.\n\n 9. But wait: the state for round i is (i mod m, i mod k). The cycle T is the smallest positive integer such that for all i, (i mod m, i mod k) repeats. However, the condition for the outcome depends on the pair (a,b). And the entire sequence of pairs for i from 0 to T-1 is distinct? Actually, the state (i mod m, i mod k) repeats every T, so the sequence of pairs is periodic with period T.\n\n 10. One more edge: if n=0, then we output (0,0).\n\n 11. Another edge: if n is very small, say 1, then we only simulate 1 round.\n\n 12. Let's test with the second sample:\n\n        Input: \n          5\n          RRRRRRRR\n          R\n\n        Here, n=5, A=\"RRRRRRRR\", B=\"R\"\n\n        m=8, k=1 -> T = LCM(8,1)=8.\n\n        Cycle simulation for 8 rounds:\n\n          Each round: a = A[i % 8] = 'R', b = B[i % 1] = 'R'\n\n          So every round is a draw.\n\n          losses_Nike_cycle = 0, losses_Poly_cycle = 0.\n\n        Then, full_cycles = 5 // 8 = 0, remainder = 5.\n\n        Then we simulate the first 5 rounds:\n\n          Each round: (R,R) -> draw.\n\n        So total_Nike = 0, total_Poly = 0.\n\n        Output: \"0 0\"\n\n        This matches.\n\n 13. However, note: the LCM computation: \n        T = (m * k) // gcd(m,k)\n\n        But if m=0 or k=0? The problem says m,k>=1.\n\n 14. Code:\n\n      We'll use math.gcd.\n\n 15. But note: the T might be very large (up to 1000000) and then we are iterating T times (for the cycle) and then remainder (which is less than T). So worst-case T=1000000, and then we do two loops of about 1000000 each (for cycle and for remainder). This is acceptable in Python? 2e6 iterations is acceptable.\n\n 16. However, we can optimize by avoiding two separate loops by doing:\n\n      We can combine the two: the cycle simulation and the remainder simulation are two separate things.\n\n 17. But note: the remainder simulation is independent and we have to do it anyway.\n\n 18. Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n 19. One more thing: the condition checks for the tuple membership. We can make a set for faster lookup? Or we can use a dictionary or a function.\n\n      Since the set of winning pairs is fixed and small (only 6 tuples), the current membership test is O(1). \n\n 20. Code:\n\n      import math\n\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      A_str = input().strip()\n      B_str = input().strip()\n\n      m = len(A_str)\n      k = len(B_str)\n\n      # If either string is empty? The problem says at least length 1.\n\n      g = math.gcd(m, k)\n      T = (m * k) // g\n\n      # Precompute the cycle (T rounds)\n      losses_Nike_cycle = 0\n      losses_Poly_cycle = 0\n\n      # We'll iterate for i in range(T)\n      for i in range(T):\n          a_char = A_str[i % m]\n          b_char = B_str[i % k]\n          if a_char == b_char:\n              continue\n          # Check if a_char beats b_char\n          if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              losses_Poly_cycle += 1\n          elif (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              losses_Nike_cycle += 1\n\n      full_cycles = n // T\n      remainder = n % T\n\n      add_Nike = 0\n      add_Poly = 0\n      for i in range(remainder):\n          a_char = A_str[i % m]\n          b_char = B_str[i % k]\n          if a_char == b_char:\n              continue\n          if (a_char, b_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              add_Poly += 1\n          elif (b_char, a_char) in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]:\n              add_Nike += 1\n\n      total_Nike = full_cycles * losses_Nike_cycle + add_Nike\n      total_Poly = full_cycles * losses_Poly_cycle + add_Poly\n\n      print(total_Nike, total_Poly)\n\n 21. Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n      Example1: n=7, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n          T = 12, but we don't use the cycle counts for the full cycles because 7<12, so full_cycles=0, remainder=7.\n\n      Example2: n=5, A=\"RRRRRRRR\", B=\"R\": T=8, full_cycles=0, remainder=5, and each round is draw.\n\n 22. However, note: the example1 sample output is \"3 2\", and our simulation for the first 7 rounds gives 3 and 2.\n\n 23. It should be correct.\n\n 24. But wait: what if the cycle is not aligned? Actually, the cycle is defined by the state (i mod m, i mod k) and we start from i=0. The entire sequence is periodic with period T, so the first T rounds form a cycle.\n\n 25. Submit the code.\n\n 26. However, note: the problem says n rounds, and we are counting from round0 to round n-1. Our simulation for the cycle and the remainder is for rounds 0 to T-1 and 0 to remainder-1 (which corresponds to the first remainder rounds). This is correct.\n\n 27. One more test: n=12, A=\"RPS\", B=\"RSPP\"\n\n        We have already computed the cycle counts (for 12 rounds). \n\n        From the example, we know the first 7 rounds: \n            losses_Nike = 3, losses_Poly = 2.\n\n        Then the remaining 5 rounds (rounds 7 to 11) are:\n\n          Round7: i=7 -> A[7 % 3] = A[1] = 'P', B[7 % 4]=B[3]='P' -> draw.\n          Round8: i=8 -> A[8%3]=A[2]='S', B[8%4]=B[0]='R' -> (S,R): \n                  Check: (S,R) -> not in [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')] -> so check (R,S) in [('R','S')] -> yes, so (b,a) = (R,S) is in the list -> so condition for b wins: so a (S) loses -> loss for Nikephoros.\n\n          Round9: i=9 -> A[9%3]=A[0]='R', B[9%4]=B[1]='S' -> (R,S): a wins -> loss for Polycarpus.\n\n          Round10: i=10-> A[10%3]=A[1]='P', B[10%4]=B[2]='S' -> (P,S): same as round1: loss for Nikephoros.\n          Round11: i=11-> A[11%3]=A[2]='S', B[11%4]=B[3]='P' -> (S,P): a wins -> loss for Polycarpus.\n\n        So for rounds 7 to 11: \n            losses_Nike: 2 (round8 and round10)\n            losses_Poly: 3 (round9 and round11, and round7 is draw, so actually round9: loss_Poly, round11: loss_Poly, and round10 is loss_Nike, and round8 is loss_Nike)\n\n        Actually, round8: (S,R) -> (b,a) = (R,S) is in [('R','S')] -> so condition for b wins: so a (S) loses -> loss_Nike.\n        round9: (R,S) -> (a,b) in [('R','S')] -> loss_Poly.\n        round10: (P,S) -> same as round1: loss_Nike.\n        round11: (S,P) -> (a,b) in [('S','P')] -> loss_Poly.\n\n        So total for the cycle (12 rounds): \n            losses_Nike = 3 (from first 7) + 2 (from next 5) = 5\n            losses_Poly = 2 (from first 7) + 2 (from next 5: round9 and round11) = 4\n\n        Now, if n=12, then we use the cycle counts: \n            losses_Nike_cycle = 5\n            losses_Poly_cycle = 4\n\n        Then output: 5 4.\n\n        But wait, we did a direct simulation for the entire 12 rounds and got 5 and 4.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds\"\n\n        So for n=12, output should be \"5 4\".\n\n        But the sample input didn't provide n=12, so we are safe.\n\n 28.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played `n` rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players use predefined sequences of moves, and the game is periodic due to the cyclic nature of these sequences. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game involves two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who use repeating sequences of moves (rock, paper, or scissors). Each round's outcome depends on the current move from each player's sequence. The challenge is to efficiently compute the total losses (red spots) over `n` rounds without iterating through each round individually, especially since `n` can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences repeat every `T` rounds, where `T` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This periodicity allows us to break down the problem into analyzing one full cycle of `T` rounds and then handling any remaining rounds after complete cycles.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Cycle Detection**: Compute `T` as the LCM of the sequence lengths. For each round in one full cycle (`0` to `T-1`), determine the number of losses for each player.\n   - **Cycle Utilization**: For `n` rounds, the total losses are the sum of losses from all complete cycles multiplied by the number of cycles, plus the losses from the remaining rounds (if any).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach efficiently handles large `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences. The algorithm processes `T` rounds (where `T` is up to 1,000,000) once and then processes the remaining rounds (up to `T-1`), making it feasible for large `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    T = (m * k) // g\n    \n    losses_Nike_cycle = 0\n    losses_Poly_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            losses_Poly_cycle += 1\n        elif (b_char, a_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            losses_Nike_cycle += 1\n            \n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    \n    add_Nike = 0\n    add_Poly = 0\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_char = A[i % m]\n        b_char = B[i % k]\n        if a_char == b_char:\n            continue\n        elif (a_char, b_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            add_Poly += 1\n        elif (b_char, a_char) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n            add_Nike += 1\n            \n    total_Nike = full_cycles * losses_Nike_cycle + add_Nike\n    total_Poly = full_cycles * losses_Poly_cycle + add_Poly\n    \n    print(total_Nike, total_Poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of rounds `n`, and the two sequences `A` and `B` used by the players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence lengths is computed to determine the periodicity of the game outcomes.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in one full cycle (`0` to `T-1`), the code checks the outcome of the round (win, loss, or draw) and updates the loss counts for each player accordingly.\n4. **Complete Cycles and Remainder**: The total losses from complete cycles are calculated by multiplying the losses per cycle by the number of full cycles. The remaining rounds are processed separately to account for any partial cycles.\n5. **Output**: The total losses for both players are printed, combining losses from complete cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large input size by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
