He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, the problem is to find all positive integers n such that the factorial of n has exactly m trailing zeros.\n\n We know that the number of trailing zeros in n! is determined by the number of times n! can be divided by 10 (which is 2*5). Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, we count the factors of 5.\n\n The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is:\n   Z(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ...\n\n However, note that we are asked: for a given m, how many n have Z(n) = m?\n\n Observation:\n   Z(n) is a non-decreasing function. For example:\n     Z(0)=0, Z(1)=0, Z(2)=0, Z(3)=0, Z(4)=0, Z(5)=1, Z(6)=1, ... Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2, etc.\n\n   But note: the value of Z(n) only increases at multiples of 5. Also, for a given m, there might be a range of n with Z(n) = m.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input m=1 -> Output: 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\n So, we are to output the set of n such that Z(n) = m.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We need to find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m, and then the largest n such that Z(n) <= m? Actually, we want exactly m.\n\n 2. Alternatively, we can find the range of n for which Z(n) = m.\n\n Let's define:\n   L(m): the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m+1? Actually, we want the smallest n for which Z(n) becomes at least m? Then the numbers from the first n where Z(n) becomes m to the last n where Z(n) is still m.\n\n But note: Z(n) is constant over intervals. For example, once Z(n) reaches m, it will remain m until we hit the next multiple of 5 (or until we accumulate an extra factor of 5 and 2).\n\n Actually, we can think:\n\n   Let f(n) = Z(n). Then we want n such that f(n) = m.\n\n   We know that f(n) is constant on intervals [a, b] and then jumps at multiples of 5.\n\n   How to find the lower bound?\n     We can use binary search to find the smallest n0 such that f(n0) >= m.\n\n   Then, the condition f(n) = m holds for n from n0 (if f(n0) is exactly m) to the next n1-1, where n1 is the smallest integer such that f(n1) >= m+1.\n\n   However, note: if there is no n with f(n)=m, then we output nothing. But the problem says m>=1 and up to 100000, and we know that for sufficiently large n, f(n) will eventually exceed any m.\n\n   But note: the example m=1: \n        n0: smallest n with f(n)>=1 is 5 (since f(5)=1).\n        Then we need to find the smallest n such that f(n)>=2: that is 10 (because f(10)=2). Then the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) have f(n)=1.\n\n   Therefore, the answer for m=1 is the integers from 5 to 9.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n   Step 1: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Call this low.\n   Step 2: Find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m+1. Call this high.\n\n   Then the set of n for which f(n)=m is the integers from low to high-1.\n\n   However, what if there is no n with f(n)=m? Then high would be low, and then the set is empty.\n\n   But note: the problem says m>=1, and we know that for n=5*m, we have at least m (actually more). But also, we know that the function f(n) is defined for all n and is non-decreasing. Moreover, the problem states that we are to output the numbers in increasing order, and if there are none, output 0.\n\n   Example: m=0? The problem states m>=1, so we don't have to handle m=0. But the problem says \"positive integers n\", so n>=1.\n\n   However, note: the problem input m is from 1 to 100000.\n\n   But wait: what if m is very large? Then the smallest n such that f(n)",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The key observation here is that the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is determined by the number of times \\( n! \\) can be divided by 10, which depends on the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the product. Since there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the limiting factor is the number of 5s in the prime factorization of \\( n! \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) is given by the sum \\( Z(n) = \\lfloor n/5 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/25 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/125 \\rfloor + \\ldots \\). This sum counts the number of times 5 appears in the factorization of numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values where \\( Z(n) = m \\), we use binary search. We first find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\) (lower bound). Then, we find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\) (upper bound). The valid \\( n \\) values lie between these two bounds.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no such \\( n \\) exists (which shouldn't happen for \\( m \\geq 1 \\)), we output nothing. However, for \\( m \\) within the given range, the solution will always find a non-empty interval.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(data[0])\n    except Exception:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    low = None\n    high = None\n    \n    # Find lower bound: smallest n with Z(n) >= m\n    lo_bound, hi_bound = 0, 5 * m\n    while lo_bound < hi_bound:\n        mid = (lo_bound + hi_bound) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m:\n            lo_bound = mid + 1\n        else:\n            hi_bound = mid\n            \n    low = lo_bound\n    \n    # Find upper bound: smallest n with Z(n) >= m+1\n    lo_bound2, hi_bound2 = low, 5 * (m + 1)\n    while lo_bound2 < hi_bound2:\n        mid = (lo_bound2 + hi_bound2) // 2\n        zeros = count_trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if zeros < m + 1:\n            lo_bound2 = mid + 1\n        else:\n            hi_bound2 = mid\n            \n    high = lo_bound2\n    \n    if low >= high:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        k = high - low\n        print(k)\n        numbers = list(range(low, high))\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This helper function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by increasing powers of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.) until the divisor exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: The first binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). The search space starts from 0 to \\( 5 \\times m \\) (a safe upper bound since \\( Z(5m) \\geq m \\)).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: The second binary search finds the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m+1 \\). The search space starts from the lower bound found previously to \\( 5 \\times (m+1) \\).\n\n4. **Output**: If the lower bound is greater than or equal to the upper bound, it means no \\( n \\) satisfies \\( Z(n) = m \\), so we output 0. Otherwise, we output the count of numbers from the lower bound to the upper bound minus one, inclusive, and list them in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of valid \\( n \\) values using binary search, leveraging the non-decreasing nature of the trailing zero count function \\( Z(n) \\). The solution handles large values of \\( m \\) (up to 100,000) efficiently by avoiding brute-force checks.",
