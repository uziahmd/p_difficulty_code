    "thought": "\n Okay, we are allowed to change at most one number in the subsegment to make it strictly increasing.\n\n Approach:\n We are going to consider three cases:\n 1. The entire sequence is already strictly increasing -> then answer n (with 0 changes) or if not, we can have a segment that might require one change.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to change one number anywhere in the subsegment.\n\n We can break the problem into:\n\n Case 1: Without any change, the longest strictly increasing contiguous subsegment.\n Case 2: With one change, we might be able to fix a dip.\n\n We can think of the following:\n\n Let dp[i] be the length of the strictly increasing subsegment ending at i without any change.\n\n But note: we are allowed to change one element anywhere in the segment. So we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Use a two-pointer method to find the longest contiguous subarray that has at most one \"break\" (and then fix that break by changing one element).\n\n However, note: the problem allows changing one element arbitrarily. So the condition for the subsegment is that there is at most one index j such that after changing one element, the whole subsegment becomes strictly increasing.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n Step 1: Precompute two arrays:\n   left[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment ending exactly at i (without breaks) [so a[i-1] < a[i], etc.]\n\n   right[i]: the length of the increasing subsegment starting exactly at i (without breaks)\n\n Then, we know that the entire subsegment must have at most one violation. There are two possibilities:\n\n Possibility 1: The subsegment does not include any violation, then we can use the standard increasing subsegment.\n\n Possibility 2: The subsegment includes one violation, and we can fix that violation by changing one element.\n\n But note: the violation might be fixed by changing an element that is either the one breaking the increasing order or adjacent to the violation.\n\n Actually, we can consider:\n\n Let L = left[i] and R = right[i]. Then, if we consider a subsegment from i to j (with j-i+1 long), we can check the entire segment for at most one violation.\n\n However, we need to design an efficient way because n can be up to 10^5.\n\n Alternative idea:\n\n We can try to traverse and consider each position as the one that we change. Then, the subsegment would be the maximal contiguous part that is almost increasing (at most one violation) and we change that one violation. But note: we are allowed to change only one element, so we can fix one violation.\n\n But note: we are allowed to choose the subsegment arbitrarily. So we can consider:\n\n  For each index i (from 0 to n-1), consider making a[i] arbitrary, then we can extend the subsegment to the left until we hit a violation (without using the fixed element) and similarly to the right.\n\n However, we have to be cautious: the left side must be strictly increasing until the fixed element, and the right side must be strictly increasing from the fixed element.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute:\n    left_inc[i] = the length of the increasing subsegment ending at i (so a[i] must be greater than a[i-1], and so on)\n        left_inc[0] = 1\n        for i from 1 to n-1:\n            if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n                left_inc[i] = left_inc[i-1] + 1\n            else:\n                left_inc[i] = 1\n\n    Similarly, right_inc[i] = the length of the increasing subsegment starting at i (so a[i] < a[i+1] and so on)\n        right_inc[n-1] = 1\n        for i from n-2 down to 0:\n            if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n                right_inc[i] = right_inc[i+1] + 1\n            else:\n                right_inc[i] = 1\n\n 2. Now, we consider two types of segments:\n\n    Type A: Entirely increasing (no change needed). Then the maximum length is max(left_inc) (or we can get the max from all increasing contiguous segments).\n\n    Type B: With exactly one change (which we use to fix one violation). Then the segment must have exactly one violation.\n\n    How to account for the violation?\n\n    Consider a segment [l, r] that has exactly one violation. The violation must occur at some index i (which we are allowed to change). Then, the conditions are:\n\n        - From l to i-1: strictly increasing (if l<=i-1)\n        - From i+1 to r: strictly increasing (if i+1<=r)\n        - And the element we change at i must be such that:\n            * If i is not the first element, then a[i-1] < (changed value) and (changed value) < a[i+1] (if exists)\n\n        But note: we are allowed to set the changed value arbitrarily. So we can set it to any integer. Therefore, the condition for the entire segment to be strictly increasing is:\n\n            - The segment from l to i-1 is increasing (if l <= i-1) and the segment from i+1 to r is increasing (if i+1<=r).\n            - Additionally, we must be able to choose a value at i that is greater than a[i-1] (if i>l) and less than a[i+1] (if i<r). \n\n        However, note that if the violation is at the beginning or end, we don't have both sides.\n\n        Conditions for the entire segment [l, r] with a change at i (the violation) to be strictly increasing:\n\n            Condition 1: The left part [l, i-1] is strictly increasing (if l < i).\n            Condition 2: The right part [i+1, r] is strictly increasing (if i < r).\n            Condition 3: \n                - If i is the first element (l=0 and i=0): then we only require that a[1] (if exists) is greater than the changed value. Since we can choose arbitrarily, we just need that the right part is increasing and the changed value is less than a[1] (if r>=1). But note: we are free to choose, so we can set it to anything less than a[1] (if exists). Similarly, if i is the last element, we set it to anything greater than a[i-1].\n                - If i is in the middle (l < i < r): then we require a[i-1] < a[i+1] (because we can set a[i] to any value between a[i-1] and a[i+1]). But note: what if a[i-1] >= a[i+1]? Then we cannot fix this by changing a[i] to something that is between them? Actually, if a[i-1] >= a[i+1], then even if we set a[i] to be between, we cannot have both a[i-1] < a[i] and a[i] < a[i+1] because the entire condition requires a[i-1] < a[i] < a[i+1] and if a[i-1] >= a[i+1] then no value of a[i] can satisfy both.\n\n        So for a middle violation, we require a[i-1] < a[i+1]. Then the entire segment [l, r] can be made strictly increasing by changing a[i] to any value in (a[i-1], a[i+1]).\n\n        But note: the entire segment [l, r] must be connected and the change is only allowed at one position.\n\n        Therefore, we can consider:\n\n          candidate_length = (left_inc[i-1] if i-1>=l then we know the left part is from i-left_inc[i-1]+1 to i-1) but wait, we have precomputed left_inc and right_inc.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          For each index i (as the one we change), the candidate segment would be:\n\n            left_side = the increasing run ending at i-1 (if exists) and right_side = the increasing run starting at i+1 (if exists).\n\n            Then, the total length without the violation is: left_inc[i-1] (if i-1 exists) + 1 (for the changed element) + right_inc[i+1] (if i+1 exists). But wait, if we change the element at i, then we must also check the connection between i-1 and i+1.\n\n            Actually, the candidate segment is:\n\n            Let L = (if i>0 then the increasing segment ending at i-1, i.e., left_inc[i-1], otherwise 0)\n            Let R = (if i<n-1 then the increasing segment starting at i+1, i.e., right_inc[i+1], otherwise 0)\n\n            Then the entire segment would be from i-L to i+R (if we consider the left part from i-L to i-1, and the right part from i+1 to i+R). However, we must check that the entire segment is connected and that the change at i fixes the drop.\n\n            But note: the entire segment must be strictly increasing. We already have the left part and the right part as increasing. The only thing is that the element at i must be chosen so that the entire segment is strictly increasing.\n\n            Conditions for the entire segment [i-L, i+R] (if we take the left part of length L and the right part of length R) to be fixed by changing a[i] are:\n\n              - If L>0 and R>0, then we require a[i-1] < a[i+1] (so that we can choose a value between them for a[i]).\n              - If L==0 (meaning i is the first element) then we don't need the left condition (only the right part must be increasing and we can set a[i] to any value less than a[i+1] if R>0, or if R==0 then we don't care about the right because the segment is just [i] and then we set a[i] arbitrarily (but then the segment is length 1, which is always increasing)).\n              - Similarly, if R==0, we only require that if L>0 then a[i-1] < (arbitrary) and we can set arbitrarily high (so no constraint from the right).\n\n            However, note: if the left part is non-empty, then the condition is that the changed value must be greater than a[i-1]. Similarly, if the right part is non-empty, the changed value must be less than a[i+1]. And if both exist, then we require a[i-1] < a[i+1].\n\n        So the candidate length for centering at i (with change) is:\n\n            base = 1 (for the changed element) + (L if L>0 else 0) + (R if R>0 else 0)\n\n            But we must ensure that if both L and R are positive, then a[i-1] < a[i+1] is true.\n\n        However, note: the left_inc[i-1] and right_inc[i+1] are independent. Also, the entire segment [i-L, i+R] is of length: (L) + 1 + (R) = L+R+1.\n\n        But wait: the left_inc[i-1] gives the increasing run ending at i-1, so the left part has length L = left_inc[i-1]. Similarly, the right part has length R = right_inc[i+1]. Then the entire segment from (i - L) to (i + R) is of length L+R+1.\n\n        However, there's a catch: the left_inc[i-1] is defined from the immediate left, but the entire left part must be increasing. Similarly for the right.\n\n        But note: our left_inc and right_inc are computed without considering the entire array. They are just the consecutive increasing runs.\n\n        Example: [2, 3, 1, 5, 6] (n=5)\n\n        Let's compute left_inc:\n            a0=2 -> 1\n            a1=3 -> 2 (since 3>2)\n            a2=1 -> 1 (since 1<3)\n            a3=5 -> 2 (since 5>1)\n            a4=6 -> 3 (since 6>5)\n\n        right_inc:\n            a4=6 -> 1\n            a3=5 -> 2 (5<6)\n            a2=1 -> 1 (1<5? no, so 1)\n            a1=3 -> 1 (3>1? no, so 1) -> wait, actually: \n                a1=3, then a2=1 -> so 3>1 is false, so right_inc[1]=1.\n            a0=2 -> 1 (2<3? yes, so right_inc[0] = 1 + right_inc[1] = 2? \n\n        Correction: right_inc is computed from the current and then the next one. We should compute:\n\n            right_inc[i] = 1 + right_inc[i+1] if a[i] < a[i+1] else 1\n\n        So for i=0: a0=2, a1=3 -> 2 < 3 -> so right_inc[0] = 1 + right_inc[1] = 1+1=2.\n\n        Similarly, i=1: a1=3, a2=1 -> 3<1 false -> right_inc[1]=1.\n        i=2: a2=1, a3=5 -> 1<5 -> right_inc[2]=1+right_inc[3]=1+2=3.\n        i=3: a3=5, a4=6 -> 5<6 -> right_inc[3]=1+right_inc[4]=1+1=2.\n\n        Then the entire array's right_inc: [2,1,3,2,1]\n\n        Now, consider the example input: \n            Input: 6\\n7 2 3 1 5 6\n\n        We want to output 5.\n\n        Let me recompute for [7,2,3,1,5,6]:\n\n        left_inc: \n            a0=7 -> 1\n            a1=2 -> 1 (2<7 -> break)\n            a2=3 -> 2 (3>2)\n            a3=1 -> 1 (1<3 -> break)\n            a4=5 -> 2 (5>1)\n            a5=6 -> 3 (6>5)\n\n        right_inc:\n            a5=6 -> 1\n            a4=5 -> 2 (5<6)\n            a3=1 -> 1 (1<5 -> yes, so 1+right_inc[4]=1+2=3)\n            a2=3 -> 1 (3>1 -> no, so 1) [But wait, 3 and 1: 3>1 is true for the condition a[i] < a[i+1]? Actually, no: the condition for right_inc is a[i] < a[i+1] (for the next element). Here, a2=3 and a3=1: 3<1 is false, so right_inc[2]=1.\n            a1=2 -> 1 (2<3 -> true, so 1+right_inc[2]=1+1=2)\n            a0=7 -> 1 (7<2 -> false, so 1)\n\n        So right_inc: [1,2,1,3,2,1]\n\n        Now, we are going to consider each index i as the one to change.\n\n        Example: In the example, the solution was to change the 3rd element (which is a3, 0-indexed index 3) from 1 to 4, and then the segment [2,3,4,5,6] is strictly increasing.\n\n        For i=3 (the element 1):\n\n            Left part: from index 3-? The left_inc[2] (index2 is the element before index3) is 2, meaning the increasing run ending at index2 (value 3) is 2 (from index1 and index2: [2,3]). So the left part has length 2, so the segment from index1 to index2 is [2,3] (increasing).\n\n            Right part: right_inc[4] (index4) is 2, meaning from index4 to index5: [5,6] (increasing).\n\n            Now, we require that the left part's last element (a2=3) is less than the right part's first element (a4=5). Indeed, 3<5 -> so we can set a3 to a value between 3 and 5, say 4.\n\n            Then the entire segment from index1 to index5: [2,3,4,5,6] -> length 5.\n\n            Candidate for i=3: left_inc[2] (which is 2) + right_inc[4] (which is 2) + 1 (for the changed element) = 5.\n\n        But wait, the entire segment we are considering is from index1 to index5, but note: the left_inc[2] starts at index1 (because left_inc[2] is the increasing run ending at index2, so the run goes from index1 to index2). Similarly, the right_inc[4] goes from index4 to index5.\n\n        So the candidate segment for i=3 is from index1 to index5, which is 5 elements.\n\n        However, we must also consider the possibility that the segment might not necessarily start at the beginning of the left_inc[i-1] and end at the end of right_inc[i+1]. Actually, we are using the entire left_inc[i-1] and right_inc[i+1] so the segment is fixed.\n\n        But what if we don't take the entire left_inc and right_inc? Actually, we are forced to take the entire increasing runs because if we break the increasing run, then the condition fails. However, note that the entire segment must be contiguous.\n\n        Steps for each index i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n          candidate = 1   (minimum is 1, because we can change one element and have a segment of length 1)\n\n          If we are going to change a[i], then:\n\n            Consider the left side: if i-1 >= 0, then we can extend to the left as long as the left_inc[i-1] is defined (but note: we are taking the entire left_inc[i-1] run). Similarly, the right side.\n\n          However, we can also consider:\n\n            candidate = min( (left_inc[i] if i-1>=0 else 1), ... ) -> no, we are not.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Let L = (if i-1 >= 0) then left_inc[i-1] else 0\n          Let R = (if i+1 < n) then right_inc[i+1] else 0\n\n          Then, if L>0 and R>0:\n              if a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                  candidate = L + 1 + R\n              else:\n                  candidate = max(L+1, R+1)   # But wait, can we still have a segment? Actually, no. Because if a[i-1] >= a[i+1], then we cannot fix the entire segment by changing a[i]. However, we can still form two separate segments: one ending at i (using the left part) and one starting at i (using the right part). But note: the problem requires one contiguous segment.\n\n          However, note: we are allowed to change only one element. The entire segment must be contiguous and we are fixing the one element. The condition above (a[i-1] < a[i+1]) is necessary for the entire segment to be strictly increasing. But if that condition fails, then we cannot use the entire left and right parts together. Then the best we can do is take the longer of the two sides (either the left side including i, or the right side including i) and set the middle element arbitrarily.\n\n          Actually, if the condition fails, then we can still form two separate segments: one that ends at i (with the left part) and one that starts at i (with the right part). But note: we are allowed to change the element at i, so the entire segment can be just the left part plus the changed element, or the changed element plus the right part.\n\n          However, the problem requires one contiguous segment. We can break the segment at the violation? No, because we are only allowed to change one element, and we are changing the element at i. So the entire segment must be contiguous.\n\n          But if a[i-1] >= a[i+1] (the condition fails), then we cannot have the entire segment (left part and right part) because the change at i cannot bridge the gap. Therefore, we must drop one of the sides.\n\n          Then the candidate length in that case would be:\n\n            candidate = max(L+1, R+1)\n\n          However, wait: what if we don't use the entire left_inc[i-1] and right_inc[i+1] but a part of them? Actually, the left_inc[i-1] is the entire increasing run ending at i-1, so we can use the entire left part (if condition holds) or only part of it? \n\n          But note: the left_inc[i-1] is the maximal increasing run ending at i-1. Similarly, the right_inc[i+1] is the maximal increasing run starting at i+1.\n\n          However, if we don't use the entire left_inc[i-1] then we might be able to form a longer segment? Actually, no. Because the left_inc[i-1] is the maximal one. But wait, we are allowed to choose the subsegment arbitrarily. However, we are trying to maximize the length.\n\n          Actually, we are considering the entire left_inc[i-1] and right_inc[i+1] because they are the maximal runs. But if the condition fails, then we cannot combine them, so we take the maximum of the two.\n\n          But what about the possibility that we don't use the entire left_inc[i-1] or the entire right_inc[i+1]? \n\n          Example: [1, 3, 2, 4]\n\n          Consider i=2 (the element 2). \n            a = [1,3,2,4]\n            left_inc = [1,2,1,2]\n            right_inc = [1,1,2,1]   [Wait, let me compute right_inc:\n\n            right_inc[3] = 1\n            i=2: a[2]=2 < a[3]=4 -> True -> right_inc[2]=1+right_inc[3]=2\n            i=1: a[1]=3 < a[2]=2 -> False -> right_inc[1]=1\n            i=0: a[0]=1 < a[1]=3 -> True -> right_inc[0]=1+right_inc[1]=2\n\n            Now, for i=2 (element 2):\n                L = left_inc[1] = 2 (so the left part is [1,3])\n                R = right_inc[3] = 1 (so the right part is [4])\n\n                Condition: a[1]=3 < a[3]=4 -> True -> so candidate = 2+1+1 = 4.\n\n                The entire segment would be [1,3,2,4] -> change the 2 to something between 3 and 4, say 3.5, then [1,3,3.5,4] is strictly increasing. So that works.\n\n          Now, if we have [1,5,2,3,4] (so the entire array is [1,5,2,3,4]), then consider i=1 (element 5):\n\n            left_inc[0] = 1 (the element 1)\n            right_inc[2] = 3 (the elements [2,3,4] -> because from index2: a[2]=2, a[3]=3, a[4]=4 -> increasing)\n\n            Condition: a[0]=1 < a[2]=2 -> True, so candidate = 1+1+3 = 5.\n\n            Then the entire segment is [1,5,2,3,4] -> change 5 to something between 1 and 2, say 1.5, then [1,1.5,2,3,4] is strictly increasing.\n\n          Now, what if we have [5,1,2,3] (so the array [5,1,2,3])?\n\n            left_inc = [1,1,2,3]\n            right_inc = [1,2,1,1] -> wait, compute right_inc:\n\n            a3=3 -> 1\n            a2=2 < 3 -> True -> right_inc[2]=1+right_inc[3]=2\n            a1=1 < 2 -> True -> right_inc[1]=1+right_inc[2]=3\n            a0=5 < 1 -> False -> right_inc[0]=1\n\n            Now, consider i=0 (element 5):\n\n                L = 0 (no left side) -> then candidate = 1 + R (if R>0) but R = right_inc[1]=3 -> then condition: since L=0, we don't require the condition a[-1] (doesn't exist) < a[1] (1). Actually, for i=0, we only require that the right side is increasing (which it is) and we can set a[0] to any value less than a[1] (if we are to connect to the right). But note: the entire segment would be [x,1,2,3] (with x being the changed value). We require x < 1. So we can set x to 0, then [0,1,2,3] is strictly increasing. So candidate length = 4.\n\n            However, according to our formula for i=0: \n                L = 0, R = 3 -> condition: since L==0, we don't check the left condition (we only check the condition when both sides exist). Then candidate = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n            Now, consider i=1 (element 1):\n\n                L = left_inc[0] = 1, R = right_inc[2]=2\n                Condition: a[0]=5 < a[2]=2 -> False -> so candidate = max(1+1, 2+1)=max(2,3)=3.\n\n            But wait, if we change a[1] (element 1) to something, then the entire segment [5, x, 2,3] must be strictly increasing. We require 5 < x and x < 2. But 5 < x and x < 2 is impossible. So we cannot use both sides. Then the maximum we can get is the maximum of the two sides: left_inc[0] (which is 1) + 1 = 2, and the right_inc[2] (which is 2) + 1 = 3. But note: we cannot combine the two sides because of the condition. However, the entire segment might not necessarily start at the beginning of the left side or end at the end of the right side. Actually, we can choose the subsegment arbitrarily. We can choose [5, x] (length 2) or [x,2,3] (length 3). But note: the entire subsegment must be contiguous.\n\n            However, the problem requires that we change at most one number. We are allowed to change one number. So we can choose the subsegment [x,2,3] (by setting x appropriately) and ignore the left part. Similarly, we can choose [5,x] (then x must be greater than 5, and then we don't care about the rest). But note: we are allowed to change only one number, so we can only change one. The subsegment [5,x] is valid if we set x to something greater than 5 (but then the condition for the entire segment [5,x] is satisfied). Similarly, [x,2,3] is valid if we set x to something between 5 and 2? Actually, no: because the entire subsegment [x,2,3] must be strictly increasing. We require x < 2. Then we can set x to 1 (but then we have two 1's? no, the original element is 1 and we are changing it to 1? That's not allowed because strictly increasing requires distinct and increasing. But note: we can set x to any integer. So we set x to 0, then [0,2,3] is strictly increasing. However, the original element at index1 is 1, and we are changing it to 0. Then the entire segment [0,2,3] is strictly increasing.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"change at most one number\", so we can change one number arbitrarily. The subsegment [0,2,3] is of length 3, and we changed one number (the one at index1). Similarly, the subsegment [5, x] (with x=6) is of length 2, and we changed one number. But we are allowed to choose the subsegment arbitrarily. So the maximum we can get from i=1 is 3.\n\n            However, note: the entire array is [5,1,2,3]. We are considering the subsegment that starts at index1 (element1) and goes to index3 (element3). But wait, the subsegment must be contiguous. We cannot skip the element at index0. However, we are allowed to choose the subsegment arbitrarily. We can choose [1,2,3] and change the first element (the 1) to 0, then [0,2,3] is strictly increasing. Or we can choose [5,1,2,3] and change the 1 to 0, then [5,0,2,3] is not strictly increasing because 5>0.\n\n            So actually, when we change an element, we can choose to exclude the left part if it breaks the condition. But note: the condition for the entire contiguous segment must hold. In the case of i=1, we cannot include the left element (5) because then we require 5 < (changed value) and (changed value) < 2, which is impossible. Therefore, the entire segment must be [x,2,3] (excluding the 5). Similarly, if we consider the left part (5) and the changed element, then the segment [5,x] must be strictly increasing: 5 < x, and then we can set x arbitrarily high. But note: the entire segment [5,x] is valid (length=2). However, we can also consider [5, x, 2,3] only if we fix the entire segment, but we cannot because 5<x and x<2 is impossible.\n\n            Therefore, for i=1, the candidate is the maximum of:\n\n                Option1: Use the left part (including the element at i) and then extend to the left until the break? Actually, no: the left_inc[i-1] is the entire increasing run ending at i-1, but we are allowed to choose the subsegment arbitrarily. However, we have precomputed left_inc and right_inc for the entire array. The key is: the left_inc[i-1] is the maximal increasing run ending at i-1. But if we want to use the left part, we must include the entire increasing run that ends at i-1? Actually, no: we can take a part of the increasing run. However, that would not help because if we break the increasing run, then the condition fails.\n\n            Actually, we are not limited to the entire left_inc and right_inc. We can take any contiguous part. But note: the goal is to maximize the length.\n\n            However, the above method of using left_inc and right_inc gives the maximal possible extension on the left and right. But if the condition fails (both sides exist and a[i-1] >= a[i+1]), then we cannot combine the two sides, so we must use the maximal side (either left or right) and then the changed element. But note: we can also use a part of the left_inc or right_inc? Actually, the left_inc and right_inc are computed as the maximal increasing runs, so we cannot extend beyond that.\n\n            Therefore, the candidate for i is:\n\n                candidate = 1\n                if i-1>=0: candidate = max(candidate, left_inc[i-1] + 1)   # This is the segment from (i - left_inc[i-1]) to i (the entire left part and the changed element) but note: the entire left part must be increasing and the changed element must be greater than the last element of the left part (if we are to include the left part). However, we are allowed to set the changed element arbitrarily, so we can set it to be greater than a[i-1] (if we are including the left part) and then the segment [left part] + [changed element] is strictly increasing.\n\n                Similarly, if i+1<n: candidate = max(candidate, 1 + right_inc[i+1])\n\n                Then, if both i-1>=0 and i+1<n and a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                    candidate = max(candidate, left_inc[i-1] + 1 + right_inc[i+1])\n\n            But wait, what if we don't use the entire left_inc[i-1] and right_inc[i+1]? Actually, we are using the entire runs because we want the maximal length. However, if we use the entire left_inc[i-1] and entire right_inc[i+1], then the segment is fixed.\n\n            However, note: the left_inc[i-1] is the entire increasing run ending at i-1. But if we use only part of it, then the condition for the entire segment might be satisfied, but the length would be shorter. So we are interested in the maximal length.\n\n            But there's another possibility: the entire segment might not necessarily be centered at i. We can fix the one change at i and then extend as far as possible to the left and right, but the left and right might have more than one violation? Actually, no: we are only allowed one change. So the entire segment must have at most one violation (the one we fix). Therefore, the left part must be increasing (until the element before i) and the right part must be increasing (after i). And the condition for connecting the left and right is that a[i-1] < a[i+1] (if both sides exist).\n\n            Therefore, the above candidate for i is:\n\n                candidate_i = 1\n                if i-1>=0:\n                    candidate_i = max(candidate_i, left_inc[i-1] + 1)\n                if i+1 < n:\n                    candidate_i = max(candidate_i, 1 + right_inc[i+1])\n\n                if i-1>=0 and i+1<n and a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n                    candidate_i = max(candidate_i, left_inc[i-1] + 1 + right_inc[i+1])\n\n            Then, the overall answer is the maximum candidate_i over all i, and also we must consider the case without any change (the standard increasing subarrays).\n\n            However, note: the standard increasing subarrays (without change) can be captured by the left_inc and right_inc as well, but our candidate_i above does not cover the entire increasing subarray that does not contain i. \n\n            Example: the entire array is increasing, then the standard increasing subarray is the whole array. But in our candidate_i, we are only considering segments that include the change at i. \n\n            Therefore, we must consider:\n\n                ans = max(ans, candidate_i for every i)\n\n                and also\n\n                ans = max(ans, max_length_without_change)\n\n            But wait, the standard increasing subarray without change is already covered by the candidate_i? Not exactly: because if we don't change any element, then we are effectively not using the change. However, in our candidate_i, we are always including the change (because we are changing a[i]). So we must separately consider the case without change.\n\n            How to handle the case without change?\n\n            We can precompute the longest increasing contiguous subarray (without any change). Let base_ans = max_{i} (left_inc[i])? Actually, no: because left_inc[i] is the increasing run ending at i, and the entire increasing run is the sum of consecutive left_inc. We can do:\n\n                base_ans = 0\n                current = 1\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n                        current += 1\n                    else:\n                        base_ans = max(base_ans, current)\n                        current = 1\n                base_ans = max(base_ans, current)\n\n            But note: the problem allows at most one change, so we can also have segments that are already strictly increasing (which are the base_ans) and then the candidate_i (with one change) might be longer.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                ans = base_ans   (the maximum increasing contiguous segment without change)\n\n                Then, for each i, candidate_i is the maximum length we can achieve by changing a[i]. Then:\n\n                    ans = max(ans, candidate_i)\n\n            But wait: the candidate_i might be smaller than base_ans? Then base_ans is the answer.\n\n            However, note: the base_ans is the maximum without change. The candidate_i is the maximum with one change at i. But we are allowed to change at most one, so",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subsegment of an array where, by changing at most one element, the subsegment can be made strictly increasing. The solution involves efficiently checking all possible subsegments that can be transformed into a strictly increasing sequence with a single modification.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Arrays**: \n   - **Left Increasing Array (left_inc)**: This array stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment ending at each index.\n   - **Right Increasing Array (right_inc)**: This array stores the length of the longest increasing subsegment starting at each index.\n\n2. **Base Answer Calculation**:\n   - The initial answer is the length of the longest strictly increasing subsegment without any modifications, computed by iterating through the array and tracking the maximum length of consecutive increasing elements.\n\n3. **Candidate Evaluation for Each Element**:\n   - For each element in the array, consider it as the one to be changed. The candidate subsegment length is determined by:\n     - The left part (if it exists): The length of the increasing subsegment ending just before the current element.\n     - The right part (if it exists): The length of the increasing subsegment starting just after the current element.\n     - If both left and right parts exist and their connecting condition (a[i-1] < a[i+1]) is satisfied, combine them with the current element to form a longer subsegment.\n   - The candidate length is the maximum of the left part + 1, the right part + 1, or the combined length (left part + 1 + right part) if conditions are met.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**:\n   - The final answer is the maximum between the base answer (longest strictly increasing subsegment without changes) and the best candidate found during the evaluation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:1+n]))\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(1)\n        return\n        \n    left_inc = [1] * n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            left_inc[i] = left_inc[i-1] + 1\n        else:\n            left_inc[i] = 1\n            \n    right_inc = [1] * n\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        if a[i] < a[i+1]:\n            right_inc[i] = right_inc[i+1] + 1\n        else:\n            right_inc[i] = 1\n            \n    base_ans = 0\n    current = 1\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if a[i] > a[i-1]:\n            current += 1\n        else:\n            base_ans = max(base_ans, current)\n            current = 1\n    base_ans = max(base_ans, current)\n    \n    ans = base_ans\n    for i in range(n):\n        candidate = 1\n        if i - 1 >= 0:\n            candidate = max(candidate, left_inc[i-1] + 1)\n        if i + 1 < n:\n            candidate = max(candidate, 1 + right_inc[i+1])\n        if i - 1 >= 0 and i + 1 < n and a[i-1] < a[i+1]:\n            total_length = left_inc[i-1] + 1 + right_inc[i+1]\n            if total_length > candidate:\n                candidate = total_length\n                \n        if candidate > ans:\n            ans = candidate\n            \n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Precompute Arrays**: The `left_inc` array is built by iterating from left to right, incrementing the count if the current element is greater than the previous one.
