Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an initial string s and a number n of queries. Each query is \"di->ti\", meaning replace every occurrence of the digit di with ti.\n\n However, note that the replacements are done sequentially, and the same digit might be replaced multiple times (and also the replacement string may contain digits that are to be replaced again).\n\n But note: the total length of all ti is <= 10^5, so we cannot do naive repeated scanning and replacing for each query (which would be too slow if we do for each digit in the entire string for each query).\n\n Important: We have to compute the number modulo 1000000007. The catch: the resulting string can be very long (because we are replacing digits with strings that might be long, and then those new digits might be replaced again). However, note that the total length of all ti is bounded by 10^5, but the intermediate string might become huge.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We cannot build the entire string because it might be extremely long (exponential growth in worst-case).\n\n Instead, we need to process the queries in reverse? Or use dynamic programming or state machines that track the value and the length?\n\n However, note: the problem says that the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5. But the same query is applied to the entire current string, and then the next query is applied to the result.\n\n Another idea: process the queries from last to first, and use a transformation that composes the replacements.\n\n Let's think: \n Suppose we have a query \"d -> t\". Then, if we consider processing from the end, we can define for each digit what it becomes after all the subsequent queries.\n\n But note: the queries are applied in the given order.\n\n We can precompute for each digit (0-9) the final string that it will become after all queries. However, the issue is that the replacement for a digit d_i might include other digits, which themselves are subject to being replaced.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that there are 10 digits (0-9). Let f(d) be the final string that the digit d becomes after applying all the queries.\n\n 2. How to compute f(d)? We process the queries in reverse order, and for each digit, we want to know what it eventually becomes.\n\n However, note: the queries are applied in the given order, so we cannot simply reverse the order and apply the transformations independently? Actually, we can use a reverse processing to compute the transformation for each digit.\n\n Idea: \n   Let F be a function that maps a digit to a string (initially, F(d) = d for each digit d).\n   Then, we are going to process the queries from last to first. But wait: the queries are applied in the forward order, so the last query is the one that is applied last.\n\n Alternatively, we can simulate the entire process without building the string by keeping track of the value and the length, but that is complicated because the string is built from digits that are transformed.\n\n However, note: we are only interested in the number modulo 1000000007. \n\n Let's consider processing the entire string s by breaking it down by digits and then combining the results. But the challenge is that the same digit might appear multiple times and the replacements are global.\n\n Another idea: since the total length of all ti is <= 10^5, we can consider that the entire set of queries can be represented as a transformation on each digit. We can precompute for each digit what it becomes at the end.\n\n Steps for reverse processing:\n\n   Let ans[d] be the string that the digit d becomes after all the queries (from first to last). Initially, we have no queries, so ans[d] = d.\n\n   Then, we are going to process the queries in reverse order. For each query (from last to first), we update the mapping for the digit being replaced.\n\n   But note: the queries are of the form \"d -> t\". When we process a query (d, t) in reverse, we need to replace every occurrence of the digit d in our current mapping (i.e., in the current ans[d]) with the transformation of t? Actually, no.\n\n   Actually, we are going to update: for each digit d, when we see a query \"x->y\" (this is the k-th query, then we will later apply the remaining queries), we want to say: if we start with x, then we first replace x with y, and then apply the rest of the queries (which we have already computed). So we should set:\n\n        ans[x] = (current transformation of the string y)   [but note: the string y might contain digits that have been transformed by the subsequent queries]\n\n   However, the subsequent queries (the ones we haven't processed yet in the reverse order) are the ones that come after this query. So we are processing from last to first, and we have already computed the transformation for all digits for the queries that come after the current one.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        Let g be the current transformation for the string y (where y is the replacement string for the query). Then, we break y into its digits, and for each digit c in y, we replace c with ans[c] (which is the transformation after all the following queries). Then, we set ans[x] = g(y) = the concatenation of the transformed versions of each digit in y.\n\n   But note: the transformation for y is not just the digits, because y might be a string of digits, and each digit must be replaced according to the later queries.\n\n   Example: \n        s0 = \"123\"\n        Queries: \n            Query1: \"2->45\"\n            Query2: \"4->6\"\n\n        Then, we process in reverse order (first process Query2, then Query1).\n\n        After processing Query2: \n            For digit '4': we set ans['4'] = \"6\" (because in Query2, we replace '4' by \"6\", and then there are no more queries)\n\n        Then process Query1: \n            For digit '2': we look at the replacement string \"45\". Now, we transform each digit in \"45\": \n                '4' becomes ans['4'] = \"6\"\n                '5' becomes ans['5'] = \"5\" (since there was no query for '5')\n            So ans['2'] = \"65\"\n\n        Then, the entire string \"123\" becomes:\n            '1' -> \"1\", '2' -> \"65\", '3' -> \"3\"\n            So the string is \"1\" + \"65\" + \"3\" = \"1653\"\n\n        And then we apply the queries: \n            First, Query1: replace '2' by \"45\" -> \"1453\"\n            Then, Query2: replace '4' by \"6\" -> \"1653\"\n\n        This matches.\n\n   However, note: the example in the problem: \n        Input: \"123123\\n1\\n2->00\" -> becomes \"10031003\"\n\n        Using our method: \n            Start: ans[d] = d for all d.\n            Query: \"2->00\"\n\n            Reverse processing (only one query): \n                For digit '2': replacement string \"00\"\n                Transform \"00\": \n                    '0' -> ans['0'] = \"0\", so \"00\" becomes \"00\"\n                So ans['2'] = \"00\"\n\n            Then the string \"123123\" becomes:\n                '1' -> \"1\", '2' -> \"00\", '3' -> \"3\", so \"100300\"\n\n            But expected output is \"10031003\"\n\n            Wait, let me check: \n                Original: 123123\n                Replace '2' by \"00\": \n                    becomes 1 (then 2 becomes 00) then 3 then 1 then 2 becomes 00 then 3 -> 1 00 3 1 00 3 -> \"10031003\"\n\n            So the issue: our transformation for the entire string is done by replacing each digit by the transformed string. But note that the replacement is global and we are replacing every occurrence. However, the string has two '2's. Our method replaces each '2' by \"00\", so we get:\n\n                '1', then \"00\", then '3', then '1', then \"00\", then '3'\n\n            Which is \"10031003\". \n\n            But wait, in our example above, we said the string becomes \"100300\", which is incorrect. Why did we write that? \n\n            Actually, we broke the original string into characters: \n                s = \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\"\n                Then we replace each character by the transformed string for that digit.\n\n            So for the first '1': use ans['1'] = \"1\"\n            Second: ans['2'] = \"00\"\n            Third: ans['3'] = \"3\"\n            Fourth: ans['1'] = \"1\"\n            Fifth: ans['2'] = \"00\"\n            Sixth: ans['3'] = \"3\"\n\n            Then the entire string is \"1\" + \"00\" + \"3\" + \"1\" + \"00\" + \"3\" = \"10031003\"\n\n            So the method is correct.\n\n   But note: the example with empty string: \n        Input: \"123123\\n1\\n3->\"\n\n        Then, the transformation for '3' is the empty string.\n\n        Then the string becomes: \n            '1' -> \"1\", '2' -> \"00\", '3' -> \"\", '1' -> \"1\", '2' -> \"00\", '3' -> \"\"\n            So \"1\" + \"00\" + \"\" + \"1\" + \"00\" + \"\" = \"100100\"\n\n        But the sample output is \"1212\".\n\n        Wait, what? The sample input was: \n            ['123123\\n1\\n3->', ...]\n\n        Actually, the sample input was provided as:\n\n            Input: \n                \"123123\\n1\\n3->\"\n\n            Output: \n                \"1212\"\n\n        Let me re-read the problem: \n            Query \"3->\" (empty string) transforms s = 123123 to 1212.\n\n        Why? \n            Original: 123123\n            Replace every '3' by empty string: \n                Remove all 3's: \n                    becomes 1 2 (remove the first 3) then 1 2 (remove the next 3) -> 1212.\n\n        So the transformation for '3' is the empty string, so indeed we remove the '3's.\n\n        Then why did we get \"100100\"? Because we did the first query (2->00) and then the second query (3->) but wait, the example input only has one query: \"3->\". \n\n        But the example input says: \n            Input: \n                \"123123\\n1\\n3->\"\n\n        So only one query. \n\n        Then, the transformation for '3' is empty, and for others they are unchanged.\n\n        So the string becomes: \n            '1' -> \"1\", '2' -> \"2\", '3' -> \"\", '1' -> \"1\", '2' -> \"2\", '3' -> \"\"\n            Then: \"1\" + \"2\" + \"\" + \"1\" + \"2\" + \"\" = \"1212\"\n\n        So we did not apply the query \"2->00\", because there is only one query and it is \"3->\". \n\n        Therefore, the example input is: \n            s = \"123123\"\n            n = 1\n            query: \"3->\"\n\n        So we don't have any query for '2'. Then how did we get \"00\" for '2'? \n\n        Correction: in the example above, we were mixing two examples. \n\n        The example \"2->00\" is in the first sample, and \"3->\" is in the second sample.\n\n        So the method works.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n        Step 1: Initialize an array (or list) `trans` for digits '0' to '9'. Let trans[d] = d (as a string) for each digit d.\n\n        Step 2: Read the queries. We'll store the queries in a list.\n\n        Step 3: Process the queries in reverse order (from last to first). For each query (d_str, t_str) where d_str is a single digit and t_str is the replacement string:\n\n            We need to transform the string t_str using the current transformations (which represent the effect of all the queries that come after the current one). \n\n            How to transform a string t_str?\n                For each character c in t_str, we replace c by trans[int(c)]? But wait: trans is defined for digits, and we have stored the string representation. Actually, we can store for each digit (character) what its final transformed string is.\n\n            However, note: the transformation for a digit c is stored as a string. So we can do:\n\n                transformed_t = ''.join(trans[c] for c in t_str)\n\n            Then set trans[d_str] = transformed_t\n\n        Step 4: After processing all queries, we transform the initial string s by replacing each digit d in s with trans[d].\n\n        Step 5: Now, we have the entire transformed string. But note: the transformed string can be extremely long (because each replacement might expand the string). However, the problem says the total length of replacement strings (ti) is <= 10^5, but the expansion might be exponential? \n\n        Actually, the problem states that the sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 10^5, and the initial string is up to 10^5. But note: the transformation we are doing in reverse is such that we are effectively replacing each digit by a string, and the entire transformation is linear in the length of the replacement strings? \n\n        However, the reverse processing: we are updating the transformation for each digit. The transformation for a digit might be a string that is the concatenation of transformed digits, and these transformed digits themselves might have been updated. But note: the total length of all replacement strings is bounded, but the expanded string for a digit might be long because the replacements might chain. \n\n        But wait: the problem says the sum of lengths of ti (the replacement strings in the queries) is <= 10^5. However, the transformation we compute for a digit might be longer than the original ti because the replacement string in a query might contain digits that are further replaced. \n\n        However, the total length of the expanded string for a digit is bounded by the fact that we are only replacing digits and the original replacement strings are limited. But note: the same digit might be replaced multiple times, and the length might blow up. \n\n        Example: \n            Query1: \"1->11\"\n            Query2: \"1->111\"\n\n            Then, processing from last to first:\n                Start: trans['1'] = '1'\n                Process Query2: \"1->111\" -> transform \"111\": \n                    For each '1' in \"111\", use the current trans['1'] (which is still '1')? But wait, we haven't processed Query1 yet. Actually, we are processing from last to first, so first we process Query2 (last) then Query1.\n\n                Step for Query2: \n                    trans['1'] becomes transform(\"111\") = \"1\"*3 = \"111\"\n\n                Then process Query1: \n                    trans['1'] becomes transform(\"11\") = \"11\" transformed: each '1' becomes \"111\", so \"11\" becomes \"111111\"\n\n            So the transformation for '1' becomes \"111111\", and the length is 6, which is the product of the expansion factors.\n\n        But note: the problem does not restrict the length of the expanded string. However, the constraints say the total length of ti (the original replacement strings) is <= 10^5, but the expanded string might be much longer.\n\n        We cannot build the entire expanded string because it might be too long (exponential in the number of queries).\n\n        Alternative: we don't need the entire string, we only need the number modulo 1000000007.\n\n        We can compute the number from the transformed string without building it, by processing the transformed string from left to right and computing the value and the power of 10 for each position.\n\n        However, the transformed string is built by expanding each digit. We can compute the value and the length (in terms of digits) for the expansion of each digit.\n\n        Let's define for each digit d (from '0' to '9') two values:\n            val[d] = the integer value of the entire expanded string for d, modulo 1000000007.\n            len[d] = the length (number of digits) of the expanded string for d.\n\n        Then, we can combine the expansions:\n\n            When we have two expansions: a string A (with value v1 and length L1) and a string B (with value v2 and length L2), then the concatenation A+B has value: \n                value = v1 * (10^(L2)) + v2\n            and length = L1 + L2.\n\n        Then, for the entire string s, we can compute the total value and length by processing each character in s, and combining the results.\n\n        But note: the transformation for a digit d is stored as a string. However, we don't want to store the entire string because it might be too long. Instead, we can store for each digit d two values: \n            value[d] = the number represented by the expanded string for d, modulo 1000000007.\n            length[d] = the number of digits (base 10) in the expanded string for d.\n\n        However, wait: the expanded string for d is the result of replacing d by the replacement string (which might contain digits that are then replaced). So we can compute:\n\n            For a digit d, if we have a transformation string t, then the expanded string is the concatenation of the expanded strings for each digit in t.\n\n            Then, the value for d is the value of the concatenation of the expanded strings of each digit in t.\n\n            Similarly, the length for d is the sum of the lengths of the expanded strings for each digit in t.\n\n        How to compute value and length for a transformation string t?\n\n            Let T = t (a string of digits)\n            Then, for each digit c in T, we know the expanded value for c (val[c]) and the expanded length for c (len[c]). Then:\n\n            total_length = 0\n            total_value = 0\n\n            For each digit c in T (from left to right):\n                total_length += len[c]\n                total_value = (total_value * (10 ** (len[c])) + val[c]) % mod\n\n            Then set val[d] = total_value, and len[d] = total_length.\n\n        But note: we are processing the queries in reverse order. So we update the transformations (both value and length) for the digit being replaced.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            mod = 1000000007\n\n            Initialize for each digit d (from '0' to '9'):\n                val[d] = d (as integer)   [if d is '0', then 0; '1' then 1, etc.]\n                len[d] = 1\n\n            Then, for each query (from last to first) \"d->t\":\n                Let d_char = the digit (e.g., '2')\n                Let t_str = the replacement string.\n\n                We need to compute the combined value and length for the string t_str, using the current val and len for each digit.\n\n                How to compute for t_str?\n                    Let new_val = 0\n                    Let new_len = 0\n\n                    For each char c in t_str:\n                        digit_index = int(c)  ? But wait, we have stored for each char (which is a digit) the value and length.\n\n                    Actually, we have an array for '0' to '9'. But t_str is a string of digits. So we can iterate over each character c in t_str:\n\n                        new_val = (new_val * pow(10, len[c], mod) + val[c]) % mod\n                        new_len = (new_len + len[c]) % (mod-1)   # But wait, for length we don't mod the exponent? However, the length is the number of digits, and the base for exponentiation is 10, but the exponentiation base is fixed.\n\n                    However, note: the length can be very large (because the expansion might be exponential) but the problem doesn't specify an upper bound on the length. But the modulus for the exponentiation base (10) is 1000000007, but the exponent (the length) is used in modular exponentiation? Actually, we don't need the exponent modulo 1000000007, because the exponent is the length, and we are computing 10^(length) mod 1000000007.\n\n                    However, the length itself is the number of digits, which can be astronomical. We cannot store the exact length as an integer because the number of digits might be huge (exponential in the number of queries). \n\n        But note: the problem says the total length of ti for all queries is <= 10^5, but the expansion might be very long. However, we are storing the length as a number that we use in exponentiation. We cannot compute 10^(length) for a huge length.\n\n        Alternative: we do not store the length as an integer, but we store the value and the length in a way that we can combine them without storing the actual length as a big integer.\n\n        However, the problem requires the number modulo 1000000007, and the length is needed to shift the value. \n\n        But note: the length is the number of digits, and we need to compute 10^(L) mod mod, where L is the length. But L might be huge (like 10^100000). We can use Euler's theorem? \n\n        Euler's theorem: a^(φ(mod)) ≡ 1 (mod mod) if gcd(a,mod)=1. Here, φ(1000000007)=1000000006.\n\n        Then, we can reduce the exponent L modulo 1000000006 (the totient) for the base 10? \n\n        However, we must be cautious: the modulus for exponents in modular exponentiation is φ(mod) for base and modulus coprime. Since 10 and 1000000007 are coprime, we can use:\n\n            power = pow(10, L, mod)   but if L is too big, we cannot compute directly.\n\n        But we can reduce L modulo φ(mod) for the exponentiation? \n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            pow(10, L, mod) = pow(10, L % φ(mod), mod)   if L >= φ(mod) and gcd(10, mod)==1.\n\n        However, note: 10 and mod (1000000007) are coprime, so yes.\n\n        But wait: the length L is the total number of digits. We are going to use the length to shift the value. We need to compute 10^(L) mod mod. We can store L modulo φ(mod) (which is 1000000006) for the purpose of exponentiation.\n\n        However, note: the length is also used to combine the lengths (to get the total length). But the total length is needed for the next transformations. \n\n        The problem: we are storing the length as an integer that might be huge. But we are only using it for two things:\n          1. To compute the exponentiation base 10 raised to the length (for shifting the value).\n          2. To add the lengths together (for the next transformation).\n\n        But if we store the length modulo φ(mod) (1000000006) for the exponentiation, then we lose the actual length. However, the length is also used in the next transformation: we need to know the total length of the transformed string to compute the next shifts.\n\n        But note: the exponentiation base 10 requires the exponent (the length) to be reduced modulo φ(mod) (because of Euler's theorem). However, the combining of lengths (for the next transformation) requires the actual length (not modulo) because we are adding the lengths (which are exponents in the next shift). \n\n        Example: \n            Suppose we have two parts: part1 has length L1, part2 has length L2, then the total length is L1+L2, and the shift for part2 is 10^(L1) (mod mod). But wait, actually when we combine two parts, we do:\n\n                value = (value1 * (10^(L2)) + value2) % mod\n\n            And the total length is L1+L2.\n\n        So we need to know the exact total length (in digits) to compute the exponentiation for the shift. But the total length can be enormous (like 10^100000). \n\n        However, note: we are only storing the value and the length (for each digit) and we are updating the value and length for each digit. \n\n        We cannot store the entire length as an integer because it is too big. But we can store the length modulo (mod-1) for the purpose of exponentiation? \n\n        Actually, we need the length for two purposes:\n\n          a) To compute the exponentiation: 10^(L) mod mod, we can reduce L modulo φ(mod)=1000000006.\n\n          b) To compute the total length for the next transformation: we need the actual length (in decimal digits) to shift the next part. But wait, is that true?\n\n        Let me clarify: \n\n          In the transformation for a digit d, we break the replacement string t into digits. Then, the value of the entire replacement string is computed by:\n\n            value = 0\n            for each digit c in t:\n                value = (value * (10^(len[c])) + val[c]) % mod\n\n          And the total length is the sum of len[c] for all c in t.\n\n          Now, note: the value is computed modulo mod, and the exponentiation 10^(len[c]) is computed modulo mod, and we can reduce the exponent (len[c]) modulo φ(mod) because 10 and mod are coprime.\n\n          However, the length (the total number of digits) is used to compute the exponentiation. But if we store the length modulo φ(mod) (say, L_mod = len % 1000000006), then we can compute the exponentiation as:\n\n            shift = pow(10, L_mod, mod)\n\n          BUT: is that correct? \n\n          We have: 10^(L) mod mod = 10^(L mod φ(mod)) mod mod, provided that L >= 0 and gcd(10,mod)=1.\n\n          However, the length L is the actual length (number of digits) and we are using it in two different ways:\n\n            - As an exponent for the base 10 (modular exponentiation) to shift the value.\n\n            - As a number to add to the total length.\n\n          For the exponentiation, we can use the reduction modulo φ(mod). But for the total length, we cannot: because the total length is the sum of the lengths of the expanded digits, and that is necessary to compute the next exponentiation.\n\n        But note: the next transformation uses the stored length (the total length) to compute the exponentiation. So we must store the actual length (or at least the length modulo φ(mod) and the total length without modulo? \n\n        However, the problem is that the length might be astronomically large. We cannot store the entire integer. \n\n        Alternative: we store two things for each digit:\n\n            val[d]: the value of the expanded string for d, modulo mod.\n\n            len_exp[d]: the exponent for the base 10 (the total length) modulo φ(mod) (for the purpose of exponentiation) and also the total length (without modulo) is not stored because it is too big.\n\n        But wait, we need the total length (the actual number of digits) to compute the next transformation's exponentiation. However, we can store the length modulo φ(mod) for the exponentiation, and then use that for the exponentiation. However, the length is also used to compute the total length (by adding) in the next transformation. But we cannot add modulo φ(mod) because the length is used as an exponent and we need to combine the exponents by addition (and then take modulo φ(mod)).\n\n        Actually, we can store:\n\n            value[d] = the numeric value of the expanded string for d, modulo mod.\n\n            exp_len[d] = the length (number of digits) of the expanded string for d, modulo φ(mod) (1000000006) [for exponentiation base 10]\n\n        Then, when processing a transformation string t for a query (d->t):\n\n            new_value = 0\n            new_exp_len = 0   (this will be the exponent length modulo φ(mod))\n\n            For each char c in t:\n                c_digit = c\n                # Multiply the current new_value by 10^(exp_len[c]) and add value[c]\n                new_value = (new_value * pow(10, exp_len[c], mod) + value[c]) % mod\n                new_exp_len = (new_exp_len + exp_len[c]) % 1000000006   # because φ(mod)=1000000006\n\n            Then set value[d] = new_value, and exp_len[d] = new_exp_len.\n\n        But wait: is that correct? \n\n        The exponentiation base 10 with exponent L (the length) is computed as 10^(L mod φ(mod)) mod mod. And we are storing the length modulo φ(mod) for each digit. Then, when combining, we use the stored exponent (modulo φ(mod)) for the shift. \n\n        However, the length is the total number of digits, and we are representing it modulo φ(mod). Then, when we use the length for shifting, we are effectively using the exponent modulo φ(mod). \n\n        But note: the formula for the value of the entire transformed string is:\n\n            value = (value_part1 * (10^(L_part2)) + value_part2) % mod\n\n        And we are using the stored exponent (L_part2 mod φ(mod)) for the exponentiation. This is valid because:\n\n            value_part1 * (10^(L_part2)) mod mod = value_part1 * (10^(L_part2 mod φ(mod))) mod mod\n\n        because 10 and mod are coprime.\n\n        However, there is a caveat: the length (the exponent) must be non-negative, and the reduction modulo φ(mod) is valid.\n\n        But also note: the length is the number of digits, which is an integer. The exponentiation 10^(L_part2) mod mod is periodic with period φ(mod). So if we know L_part2 mod φ(mod), we can compute 10^(L_part2) mod mod.\n\n        However, the length is used to compute the total length (for the entire transformed string) by adding the lengths of the parts. But we are storing the total length modulo φ(mod). Then, the next transformation will use the total length modulo φ(mod) for the exponentiation, but the actual total length (without modulo) is not known. \n\n        Is that acceptable? \n\n        Consider: the entire transformation is linear in the sense of the value and the exponent length. The value is computed correctly modulo mod, and the exponent length is stored modulo φ(mod) so that the exponentiation for shifting is correct. \n\n        But note: the length is also used to compute the total length (for the entire string) at the end. However, the problem does not require the length, only the value modulo 1000000007.\n\n        Therefore, we only care about the value and the shifting exponent, which can be computed using the length modulo φ(mod). \n\n        However, there is a catch: the length is the number of digits, and when we shift, we use the entire length (the actual integer) as the exponent. But by Euler's theorem, we can reduce the exponent modulo φ(mod). \n\n        Steps for the algorithm:\n\n            mod = 1000000007\n            mod_exp = 1000000006   # Euler's totient for mod (since mod is prime)\n\n            Initialize:\n                value = [0]*10   # for digits 0 to 9\n                exp_len = [0]*10   # for digits 0 to 9\n\n            For digit d from 0 to 9:\n                value[d] = d\n                exp_len[d] = 1   # because one digit\n\n            Then, read the queries and store them.\n\n            Then, process the queries in reverse order (from last to first).

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to process a series of string replacement queries on an initial digit string and then compute the resulting number modulo 1000000007. The challenge lies in efficiently handling the replacements without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous intermediate strings, which could be computationally infeasible due to their exponential growth.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing multiple queries where each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit in the current string with another string. The key observation is that each query's effect can be precomputed by processing the queries in reverse order, leveraging dynamic updates for each digit's transformation.\n2. **Insight**: For each digit, we maintain two values:\n   - `value[d]`: The numeric value of the string obtained by replacing digit `d` with its corresponding replacement strings from all subsequent queries, modulo 1000000007.\n   - `exp_len[d]`: The length of this resulting string, modulo 1000000006 (since 1000000007 is prime, Euler's theorem allows exponent reduction).\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize `value` and `exp_len` arrays for digits 0-9. Initially, each digit maps to itself.\n   - Process each query in reverse order. For each query \"d->t\", compute the new `value` and `exp_len` for digit `d` by combining the transformations of each digit in the replacement string `t`.\n   - Use modular exponentiation to handle large powers efficiently during value computation.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The approach processes each query once in reverse, and for each query, processes each character in the replacement string. Given that the sum of all replacement string lengths is up to 10^5, the total operations are linear, making the solution efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nmod = 1000000007\nmod_exp = 1000000006\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data: \n        print(0)\n        return\n    s = data[0].strip()\n    n_line = data[1].strip()\n    n = int(n_line) if n_line else 0\n    \n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        parts = data[i].split('->')\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        d_str = parts[0].strip()\n        t_str = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((d_str, t_str))\n    \n    value = [i for i in range(10)]\n    exp_len = [1] * 10\n    \n    for i in range(len(queries)-1, -1, -1):\n        d_char, t_str = queries[i]\n        if len(d_char) != 1:\n            continue\n        d_digit = ord(d_char) - ord('0')\n        if t_str == \"\":\n            value[d_digit] = 0\n            exp_len[d_digit] = 0\n            continue\n        \n        new_value = 0\n        new_exp_len = 0\n        for c in t_str:\n            if c in '0123456789':\n                c_digit = ord(c) - ord('0')\n                new_value = (new_value * pow(10, exp_len[c_digit], mod) + value[c_digit]) % mod\n                new_exp_len = (new_exp_len + exp_len[c_digit]) % mod_exp\n        \n        value[d_digit] = new_value\n        exp_len[d_digit] = new_exp_len\n\n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char in '0123456789':\n            d_digit = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            result = (result * pow(10, exp_len[d_digit], mod) + value[d_digit]) % mod\n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The `value` array starts with each digit mapping to itself, and `exp_len` starts with each digit having a length of 1 (since each digit is a single character).\n2. **Query Processing**: Queries are processed in reverse order. For each query, the replacement string's digits are transformed using the current `value` and `exp_len` values. The new `value` and `exp_len` for the queried digit are computed by combining these transformations.\n3. **Result Computation**: After processing all queries, the initial string is transformed digit by digit using the final `value` and `exp_len` values. The result is computed by iteratively combining each digit's contribution, using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n4. **Efficiency**: By processing queries in reverse and using dynamic updates, the solution avoids explicitly constructing large intermediate strings, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
