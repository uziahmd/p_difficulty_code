The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$. Note that $$$mod$$$ may not be a prime.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$mod$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 500$$$, $$$1\\le mod\\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer, which is the answer modulo $$$mod$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 403458273']\n\n### Output\n['17']\n\n## Note\nThe following are all valid pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ when $$$n=4$$$.  $$$p=[1,3,4,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,2,3]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,4,3]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,3,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,3,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,1,3]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,4,2]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,2,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,2,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,1,2]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,3,2]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,2,1,3]$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are counting pairs (p, q) of permutations of [1, n] such that:\n 1. p is lexicographically smaller than q.\n 2. The inversion count of p is greater than the inversion count of q.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let I(p) be the inversion count of permutation p.\n\n Conditions: \n   p < q (lexicographically) and I(p) > I(q).\n\n We note that the total number of permutation pairs is n! * n! which is huge, so we cannot iterate over all.\n\n We can use dynamic programming to count the pairs.\n\n However, note that the constraints are n up to 500, so we need an efficient DP.\n\n Idea:\n\n We consider building the permutation from left to right. We have two permutations p and q.\n\n We can think of the following:\n\n   Let dp[i][a][b] = number of ways for the first i positions such that:\n        - the inversion count of p's first i elements is a,\n        - the inversion count of q's first i elements is b,\n        - and the condition that p is lexicographically less than q (so far) holds? \n\n But note: the lexicographic condition is global. We cannot wait until the entire permutation to check because we need to compare two sequences.\n\n Alternatively, we can use generating functions or combinatorial identities, but note that the conditions are complex.\n\n Another idea: we break down the problem by considering the relative order at each position.\n\n But note: the condition on inversions is about the entire permutation. Also, the lexicographic condition is built as we go.\n\n We can consider state:\n\n   dp[i][x][y] where:\n        i: the current position (from 0 to n)\n        x: the inversion count of p[0:i] (this might be too big, because inversion count can be up to ~n^2/2, and n=500 -> 125000 states per i, and i from 0 to 500 -> 500*125000 = 62.5e6 states, but then we have two more dimensions for inversion counts? Actually, we have two inversion counts (for p and q) and they range from 0 to max_inv, which is O(n^2). So the state space would be about 500 * (125000) * (125000) which is too big.\n\n We need a different approach.\n\n Insight:\n\n We can fix the two permutations by their common length. But note that the lexicographic condition is defined by the entire sequence.\n\n Alternate known approach for counting inversion pairs with lex conditions?\n\n We can also note that the lexicographic condition is independent of the inversion count condition? \n\n However, note that we require both: p < q and I(p) > I(q).\n\n We can use generating functions for inversions and then combine with lex order.\n\n But note: the inversion count for a permutation of length n is between 0 and n*(n-1)//2, which is 124750 for n=500. That is too high for a DP dimension.\n\n We must use a different method.\n\n Another idea: inclusion-exclusion or generating permutations in a smarter way.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider the following:\n\n Let F(n) be the number of pairs (p, q) of permutations of [1, n] such that p < q and I(p) > I(q).\n\n How to relate F(n) to F(k) for k < n?\n\n Consider building the permutations from left to right. At the first position, we choose two distinct numbers for p_1 and q_1.\n\n But note: the entire set of numbers is {1,2,...,n}. However, we are free to assign the numbers arbitrarily to p and q? Actually, no: the condition is that p and q are permutations of [1, n]. So we are assigning two distinct numbers for the first element? Actually, we can assign any two distinct numbers, but then the rest must be assigned without repetition.\n\n However, we can consider the following:\n\n   Let the first element of p be x and the first element of q be y.\n\n Conditions at the first step:\n\n   Case 1: x < y -> then p is lexicographically less than q (so far). Then we can continue with the remaining n-1 numbers for both p and q, but note: the remaining numbers are the original set minus {x,y}. And the inversion counts for the rest will depend on the choices.\n\n   Case 2: x > y -> then p is lexicographically greater than q (so far), so this entire branch is invalid.\n\n   Case 3: x == y -> not allowed since we are using distinct numbers.\n\n Therefore, we must have x < y at the first position.\n\n But wait:",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of pairs of permutations (p, q) of length n such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the inversion count of p is greater than that of q. The solution involves dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics to efficiently compute the result modulo a given number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires counting pairs of permutations under two conditions: lexicographical order and inversion count comparison. Direct enumeration is infeasible for large n (up to 500), so we use dynamic programming to break the problem into smaller subproblems.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution leverages the fact that the first element of p must be less than the first element of q for p to be lexicographically smaller. We then consider the remaining elements, ensuring the inversion counts meet the required condition.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We define DP states `dp[i][j][k]` where:\n   - `i` is the current position being processed.\n   - `j` is the difference in inversion counts between p and q up to position `i`.\n   - `k` is the minimum inversion count observed so far in p or q.\n\n4. **Transition**: For each position, we consider all possible pairs of numbers not yet used in p or q, updating the inversion count differences and ensuring the lexicographical condition is met.\n\n5. **Combinatorial Counting**: The solution uses combinatorial terms to count valid sequences efficiently, avoiding the need for brute-force checks.\n\n6. **Modulo Handling**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo the given number, which may not be prime.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(10000)\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    mod = int(data[1])\n    \n    total_perm = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        total_perm = (total_perm * i) % mod\n        \n    max_inv = n*(n-1)//2\n    if n <= 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    def inv_count(n):\n        if n <= 1:\n            return 0\n        return (n*(n-1))//2\n\n    def nCr(n, r):\n        if r < 0 or r > n:\n            return 0\n        num = 1\n        den = 1\n        for i in range(1, r+1):\n            num = num * (n -
