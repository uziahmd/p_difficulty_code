He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. One of them might be 'R' (Roman numerals) or both integers.\n Then a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (might have leading zeros, but length <= 1000).\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the number from base a to decimal (base 10) first, and then convert that decimal number to Roman numerals.\n    However, note: the input c is given in base a. So we must first convert c (which is a string in base a) to an integer in base 10.\n\n 2. If b is an integer, then we convert the given string c (base a) to base 10, then from base 10 to base b.\n\n But note: the problem says that the input c is in base a and may contain digits beyond 9? Actually, the base a is between 2 and 25, and the digits can be represented by 0-9 and then letters for digits above 9. Since a is at least 2 and at most 25, the digits can go up to 24 (so we might have digits represented by 'A' for 10, 'B' for 11, ... up to 'X' for 24? Actually, we don't know the exact representation, but note the example: \"12 13\\nA\" -> output 'A'. In base 12, the digit A represents 10.\n\n However, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^10^15\" — wait, that seems very large. Actually, the note says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^10^15.\" — This is confusing because 10^10^15 is astronomically huge. But note: the base a is at most 25, and the string length is at most 1000. So the maximum value in base 25 with 1000 digits is 25^1000, which is way bigger than 10^10^15. However, the problem says that if not Roman, the number (in base 10) won't exceed 10^10^15? Or is there a typo?\n\n Let me re-read: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\". Wait, the example input has numbers like '1111001' (base 2) and 'A' (base 12). The problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\" — wait, no, the example says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510\", but then the sample input has base 2 with 7 digits (which is 127) and base 12 with one digit 'A' (which is 10). \n\n Actually, the problem statement says: \n   \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\n But wait, 101510 is 101510. So the non-Roman numbers are guaranteed to be <= 101510? That's a small number. Also, the Roman numbers are guaranteed to be between 1 and 300010.\n\n However, note: the input c is in base a. So even if the base a is 2, the number 1111001 (base 2) is 121 in base 10. But wait, the example input says: \n      Input: '2 2\\n1111001' -> Output: '1111001'\n\n So we have two cases:\n\n Case 1: b is an integer (2 to 25)\n   Steps:\n     Step 1: Convert the string c (which is in base a) to a base 10 integer.\n        How? We know that the string c uses digits that represent values from 0 to a-1.",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, where the target base could be either an integer between 2 and 25 or the Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to base 10, and then converting the base 10 number to the desired target base (either an integer base or Roman numerals).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The first step is to convert the input number from its original base (given as `a`) to a decimal (base 10) number. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its numerical value, and then computing the total value by considering its position in the original base.\n2. **Conversion to Target Base**:\n   - **Integer Base**: If the target base `b` is an integer, convert the decimal number to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders. The remainders are then mapped back to their respective digits (including letters for values greater than 9).\n   - **Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals. This involves breaking down the number into its constituent values (like thousands, hundreds, tens, and units) and mapping each part to the corresponding Roman numeral symbols, following the rules of additive and subtractive notation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1] if len(first_line) > 1 else None\n    \n    c_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    try:\n        a = int(a_str)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid base a\")\n        return\n        \n    try:\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            target_base = 'R'\n        else:\n            b = int(b_str)\n            target_base = b\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid base b or R\")\n        return\n\n    # Convert the input string from base `a` to base 10\n    num_base10 = 0\n    digits = []\n    for char in c_str:\n        if char in '0123456789':\n            d = int(char)\n        else:\n            d = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n        digits.append(d)\n        \n    for i, digit_val in enumerate(digits):\n        power = len(digits) - 1 - i\n        num_base10 += digit_val * (a ** power)\n        \n    if num_base10 == 0:\n        print(\"\")\n        return\n        \n    if target_base == 'R':\n        roman_numerals = []\n        num = num_base10\n        \n        roman_map = [\n            (1000, 'M'),\n            (900, 'CM'),\n            (500, 'D'),\n            (400, 'CD'),\n            (50, 'L'),\n            (40, 'XL'),\n            (10, 'X'),\n            (9, 'IX'),\n            (5, 'V'),\n            (4, 'IV'),\n            (1, 'I')\n        ]\n        \n        for value, symbol in roman_map:\n            while num >= value:\n                roman_numerals.append(symbol)\n                num -= value\n                \n        print(''.join(roman_numerals))\n    else:\n        b = target_base\n        if b < 2 or b > 36:\n            print(\"Invalid base b\")\n            return\n            \n        digits_b = []\n        num = num_base10\n        if num == 0:\n            digits_b.append('0')\n        else:\n            while num:\n                remainder = num % b\n                if remainder < 10:\n                    digit_char = str(remainder)\n                else:\n                    digit_char = chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10)\n                digits_b.append(digit_char)\n                num //= b\n                \n        if not digits_b:\n            print('0')\n        else:\n            digits_b.reverse()\n            result = ''.join(digits_b)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the bases `a` and `b` (or 'R' for Roman numerals) and the number string `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The input string `c` is processed digit by digit. Each digit is converted from its character representation to its numerical value (handling both numeric digits and alphabetic digits for bases higher than 10). These values are then used to compute the decimal equivalent by considering each digit's positional value in base `a`.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**:\n   - **Integer Base**: The decimal number is converted to the target base by repeatedly dividing by the base and collecting remainders. The remainders are mapped to their corresponding digits (using letters for values 10 and above).\n   - **Roman Numerals**: The decimal number is broken down into parts that correspond to Roman numeral symbols (like thousands, hundreds, etc.). Each part is converted to its Roman numeral representation using predefined mappings, ensuring correct subtractive notation (e.g., 4 is 'IV', 9 is 'IX').\n4. **Output**: The result is printed, omitting any leading zeros. If the conversion results in an empty string (like when converting 0 to Roman numerals), an empty string is printed.",
