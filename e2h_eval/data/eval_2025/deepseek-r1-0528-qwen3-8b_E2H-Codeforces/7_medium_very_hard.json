The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 10,000 test cases and n can be as large as 10^18.\n\n Let's analyze the snowflake construction:\n\n Rule 1: Start with one vertex.\n Rule 2: The initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k > 1). Now we have 1 + k vertices.\n Rule 3: Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., leaves) must be connected to k more new vertices. And this step should be done at least once.\n\n But note: after the first expansion, we have one central vertex and k leaves. Then, each of these k leaves will be connected to k new vertices? However, the rule says \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" — initially, the central vertex has degree k (so not a leaf) and the k leaves have degree 1. Then we do the step at least once: so we expand from the k leaves.\n\n However, note that when we expand from a leaf, we add k new vertices, but then that leaf now has degree 2 (it was connected to the center and then we added k edges from it) — so it is no longer a leaf. But also, the new vertices are leaves.\n\n Actually, the process is:\n\n Layer 0: 1 vertex (the center)\n Layer 1: k vertices attached to the center. Now total vertices = 1 + k.\n Then, for each leaf in layer 1 (there are k leaves), we add k new vertices. So we add k * k vertices. Then total vertices = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n But wait, the rule says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" — so after the first expansion, there are k leaves (each with degree 1). Then we do the second expansion: we take each of these k leaves and connect them to k new ones. Then the original leaves become non-leaves (they now have degree 2) and the new ones are leaves.\n\n Now, can we do this again? The problem says \"at least once\", meaning the second expansion is mandatory? Actually, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n So the minimum number of expansions is two: the first expansion (from the center) and at least one expansion from the leaves.\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify the total number of expansions. So we can have:\n\n - Expansion 1: center -> k leaves. Total layers: 1 (center) + 1 (first ring) and then we must do at least one more expansion.\n\n But actually, the problem says:\n   Step 1: initial vertex connected to k new -> then we have 1+k vertices.\n   Then, \"this step\" (meaning connecting leaves to k new) should be done at least once.\n\n So the minimal snowflake has two expansions: \n   Layer0: 1\n   Layer1: k\n   Layer2: k*k\n\n Total n_min = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require exactly two expansions. We can do more than one additional expansion? \n\n Actually, the description says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\" \n\n But note: after the second expansion, the leaves are the new ones (from the second expansion). Then we can do a third expansion: from those leaves, we add k new ones, so then total vertices would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\n In fact, the snowflake can have multiple layers. The entire snowflake is built by:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   (with m>=1, meaning at least two layers: m=0 gives just the center, but then we must have at least one expansion so m>=1)\n\n But wait, the problem says \"at least once\" for the second step, meaning the first expansion (from center) is mandatory and then at least one expansion from the leaves. So the minimal is two layers (m=1) and then we can have more.\n\n However, note that the first expansion is also described as part of the construction. The problem does not explicitly say we can stop after the first expansion? It says:\n\n   Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\n So the first expansion (the one from the center) is followed by at least one more expansion (from the leaves). Therefore, the minimal number of expansions is two: one from the center and one from the leaves.\n\n But note: the example smallest snowflake for k=4: \n   Layer0: 1\n   Layer1: 4\n   Layer2: 4*4 = 16\n   Total: 1+4+16 = 21? Actually, wait the example says the smallest for k=4, but the example input doesn't show 21. \n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact structure beyond the rules. But note: we can have more than two layers? \n\n Actually, the problem does not say that we stop after two layers. It says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning we do the expansion from leaves at least once. But we can do more than one time? \n\n Let me re-read: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n The step (connecting leaves to k new) is done at least once. It does not say we cannot do it more than once.\n\n Therefore, the snowflake can have any number of layers (m) from 2 to infinity, and the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   (with m>=1, meaning at least two layers)\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the first expansion (layer1) is mandatory, then we do at least one expansion (so layer2 is mandatory). Then we can do layer3, etc.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the entire graph to have the same k for all layers? Actually, the rule is that each leaf (vertex of degree 1) must be expanded to k new vertices. So k is fixed for the entire snowflake.\n\n So the total number of vertices is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   (geometric series)\n\n We are given an integer n (from 1 to 10^18) and we need to check if there exists an integer k>1 and an integer m>=1 such that:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n Note: the geometric series sum is:\n\n   n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n Also note: we can have m=0? No, because the problem says at least one expansion (so m>=1). But wait, what if we consider the center alone? Then n=1. However, the problem says k>1, and the first expansion requires k>1, but the problem also says the step (expanding leaves) must be done at least once. So n=1 is not allowed because we must have at least two layers? \n\n But note: the problem says \"This step should be done at least once\", meaning the expansion from leaves must occur at least once. However, the expansion from leaves requires the existence of leaves. The leaves come from the first expansion. So the minimal configuration is:\n\n   Layer0: 1 (center) -> no leaves? Actually, the center has degree k (which is >1) so it is not a leaf. Then we have k leaves. Then we expand each leaf (so we do the step once).\n\n Therefore, the minimal n is:\n\n   n_min = 1 + k + k^2   (for m=1, meaning two expansions: the first expansion (from center) and one expansion from leaves)\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify that we must stop at two layers. We can have more. So for a fixed k, we can have:\n\n   n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)   for some m>=1 (so at least two layers).\n\n But note: the problem does not require the entire graph to have the same k? Actually, the rule says that each leaf is connected to k new ones, so k is fixed.\n\n Now, the problem: Given n, determine if there exists integers k>1 and m>=1 such that n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1).\n\n However, note: the series representation is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n And note that m>=1 (so at least two layers: the center, the first ring, and the second ring) OR wait, actually the first expansion is the first ring (m=1 term) and then we do at least one expansion from the leaves (so the next ring, m=2). Therefore, the minimal m is 1 (meaning two layers: the center and the first ring) plus the expansion from the leaves (so the second ring) — that is, m (the exponent) is at least 2? \n\n Let me clarify:\n\n   m = 0: n = (k^1-1)/(k-1) = 1. Not allowed (because k>1, but even if k=2, n=1; however, the problem requires at least one expansion from leaves, which requires leaves. The leaves come from the first expansion, so we must have at least the center and the first ring, and then at least one expansion from the leaves. So minimal is two expansions, meaning:\n\n   m = 1: then the series has terms from exponent 0 to 1: 1 + k. But wait, that is only two layers: the center and the first ring. Then we must expand the leaves (the first ring) at least once, so we must have the next ring (exponent 2). Therefore, the minimal is m=2: \n\n   n = (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n However, the problem statement says: \n   Step 1: initial vertex connected to k new (so we get 1+k).\n   Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (which are the k leaves) is connected to k new. So we add k*k, so total is 1+k+k^2.\n\n Therefore, the minimal is indeed two expansions (the first expansion and then one expansion from the leaves). So m (the exponent) must be at least 2.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   Let r = m+1, then we have:\n\n      n = (k^r - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   and r >= 2 (since m>=1, so r>=2). But note: if we let r be the total number of layers (including the center as layer0), then the exponents go from 0 to r-1, so the series has r terms. Then:\n\n      n = (k^r - 1) / (k-1)   for r>=2.\n\n However, note: the first expansion (center to k) is r=1 (only center and the first ring) but then we must do at least one expansion from the leaves, so r must be at least 2 (then we have center, first ring, and second ring). \n\n But wait, the problem says the first expansion (from the center) is done, and then the expansion from leaves is done at least once. So the total layers (r) is at least 2 (meaning two rings: the center is layer0, the first ring is layer1, and the second ring is layer2). Then the formula uses exponent r (which is the total layers, meaning the highest power is k^(r-1))? \n\n Actually, the standard geometric series for a snowflake with r layers (r>=2) is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(r-1) = (k^r - 1) / (k-1)\n\n So we require:\n\n   n = (k^r - 1) / (k-1)   for some integer k>1 and integer r>=2.\n\n However, note: we can also consider the possibility of having only two layers (r=2) and three layers (r=3), etc.\n\n How to solve for n up to 10^18?\n\n Since n can be as large as 10^18, we cannot iterate over k and r blindly.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   For a fixed r (number of layers, which is at least 2), we can try to find an integer base k>1 such that:\n\n        (k^r - 1) / (k-1) = n\n\n   Rearranged:\n\n        k^r = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   Or, for fixed r, we can solve for k. However, note that r is at least 2 and the maximum value of r is logarithmic (base 2) of n, because k>=2, so:\n\n        n = (k^r - 1) / (k-1) >= (2^r - 1) / 1 = 2^r - 1\n\n        => 2^r <= n+1, so r <= log2(n+1)\n\n   Since n <= 10^18, then r is at most about 60 (because 2^60 is around 1e18).\n\n Therefore, we can iterate over the possible exponents r from 2 up to about 60 (or until 2^r > n+1). Then, for each r, we need to solve for k in:\n\n        k^r = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   But note: the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n        k^r = n*k - n + 1\n\n        => k^r - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   However, we can also think: for a fixed r, we can use binary search for k? But note that k is an integer and k>1.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the left side (k^r) must equal n*(k-1)+1. We can rearrange:\n\n        k^r - 1 = n*(k-1)\n\n        => (k^r - 1) / (k-1) = n\n\n   We can also write:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(r-1)\n\n   We know that for a fixed r, the function f(k) = (k^r-1)/(k-1) is increasing for k>1. Therefore, we can try to find an integer k such that f(k)=n.\n\n   How to compute k for a given r? We can use the fact that:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(r-1)\n\n   Since k>=2, we can bound k:\n\n        n >= 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^(r-1) = 2^r - 1.\n\n        => k >= 2.\n\n        Also, note that the largest term is k^(r-1) and the entire sum is roughly k^(r-1)*r/(r) (but actually dominated by the last term). We can set:\n\n        k^(r-1) <= n < (k+1)^(r-1) * r/(r) ? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use binary search for k for a fixed r. But note: the equation is:\n\n        n = (k^r - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   We can compute k by solving:\n\n        k^r = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   However, note that k must be an integer. So we can iterate k from 2 to ... but what is the upper bound for k?\n\n        Since n = (k^r-1)/(k-1) >= k^(r-1) (because the geometric series has at least the last term)\n\n        => k^(r-1) <= n\n\n        => k <= n^(1/(r-1))\n\n   But note: for r=2, then k <= sqrt(n). For r=3, k <= n^(1/2). And so on.\n\n   However, since r is at most 60, and n can be up to 10^18, then for r=2, k can be up to 10^9, which is too many to iterate.\n\n Therefore, we need a smarter way.\n\n Let's consider: we are iterating over r from 2 to about 60. Then for each r, we can solve for k by using the fact that k must satisfy:\n\n        k^r = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   But note: we can also use the formula for the geometric series to express k in terms of n and r.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that k is the root of the equation:\n\n        (k^r - 1) = n*(k-1)\n\n   This equation is:\n\n        k^r - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   We can use binary search for k in the range [2, floor(n^(1/(r-1)))]? But the exponentiation might be expensive and the upper bound for k is about n^(1/(r-1)), which for r=2 is sqrt(n) (about 10^9) which is too many to iterate.\n\n Another idea: for fixed r, we can use the formula:\n\n        n = (k^r - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   => k^r = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   We can rearrange to:\n\n        k^r - n*k + (n-1) = 0\n\n   And note that k must be an integer. We can try to find k by checking the candidate bases. However, the degree is r, which is small (<=60) but k might be very large (like 10^9 for r=2) so we cannot iterate over k.\n\n We need to avoid iterating over k. Instead, we can use the following:\n\n   Consider that the equation:\n\n        k^r = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   is equivalent to:\n\n        k^(r-1) + k^(r-2) + ... + k + 1 = n\n\n   We can use the method of bounding k by the dominant term:\n\n        k^(r-1) < n < r * k^(r-1)   [since the geometric series with base k and r terms is bounded by k^(r-1)*(1 + 1/k + ... ) < k^(r-1)* (1/(1-1/k)) = k^(r-1) * (k/(k-1))]\n\n   Therefore, k^(r-1) <= n <= (k/(k-1)) * k^(r-1)\n\n   But note: the upper bound is not linear. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        k^(r-1) <= n <= (k^r-1)/(k-1) = n, so that doesn't help.\n\n   Actually, we can use:\n\n        k^(r-1) <= n   (since the last term is k^(r-1) and the rest are positive)\n\n        and n < k^r / (k-1)   [but we don't have a simple inequality]\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the fact that k must be the base of a geometric series that sums to n. We can use binary search on k for a fixed r, but the range of k is from 2 to about n^(1/(r-1)). For r=2, that's 2 to 10^9, which is too big for a binary search (each binary search would take about 30 iterations, but then we do that for each r from 2 to 60, and 59*30 ~ 1770 checks per test case? But wait, we have up to 10,000 test cases, so 10,000 * 1770 is 17.7e6, which is acceptable in C++ but in Python we must be cautious.\n\n   However, note: the test cases are up to 10,000, but the r loop goes from 2 to about 60 (so 59 values) and for each r we do a binary search for k in the range [2, n^(1/(r-1))]. The total number of operations would be 10,000 * 59 * (log2(n^(1/(r-1)))).\n\n   For r=2: n^(1/1)=sqrt(n) which is 10^9, so log2(10^9) is about 30. So 59 * 30 * 10,000 = 17.7e6 * 10,000? Wait, no: the 10,000 is the number of test cases, and for each test case we do 59 * (binary search steps). Each binary search for a fixed r and n takes about O(log2(high)) steps, and high = n^(1/(r-1)).\n\n   For r=2: high = n, so we cannot do that because then the binary search would be from 2 to n, which is 10^18, and the logarithm base 2 of 10^18 is about 60, so 60 steps per r=2.\n\n   Then for each test case, we do:\n\n        for r from 2 to 60:\n            low = 2\n            high = n**(1/(r-1))   (but wait, we cannot compute n**(1/(r-1)) for n=10^18 and r=2? That is 10^9, which is acceptable, but for r=3, we do n**(1/2) which is 10^9, same as r=2. For r=4, n**(1/3) is about 10^6, etc.)\n\n   Actually, for r=2: we have the equation: n = (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1, so k = n-1. Then we just need to check if k = n-1 is an integer and k>1. But wait, that is the solution for r=2.\n\n   However, note: the equation for r=2:\n\n        n = (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1   (if k != 1)\n\n        => k = n-1.\n\n   So for r=2, we can simply check: if n-1 is an integer greater than 1, then k = n-1 is a solution.\n\n   Similarly, for r=3:\n\n        n = (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 + k + k^2.\n\n        We can solve for k: k^2 + k + 1 - n = 0.\n\n        Then k = (-1 + sqrt(1+4*(n-1))) / 2.\n\n        Then we check if the discriminant is a perfect square and the resulting k is an integer greater than 1.\n\n   Similarly, for general r, we can use the equation:\n\n        n = (k^r - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   This is a polynomial equation of degree r-1. We can use the fact that k must be an integer and use the rational root theorem? But we are iterating over r, and for each r we can solve for k.\n\n   However, note: we have up to 10,000 test cases and we want to avoid heavy computation.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the problem is symmetric: the equation for fixed r is:\n\n        k^r = n*(k-1)+1\n\n   We can use binary search for k for each r, but the range for k is [2, n^(1/(r-1))]. The upper bound for k is n^(1/(r-1)).\n\n   Steps for a fixed test case n:\n\n        If n==1: then no, because we require at least two layers (so n>=1+k+k^2, and k>=2, so n>=5) but wait, minimal n is 1+2+4=7? Actually, minimal n is for k=2, r=2: n= (2^3-1)/(2-1)=7? \n\n        Wait, let's recast: \n\n          r=2: n = (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1. For k=2: n=3. So minimal n for k=2, r=2 is 3.\n\n        But note: the problem says k>1, and the minimal k is 2.\n\n        So the minimal n is 3 (for k=2, r=2).\n\n        Then what about n=1? -> NO.\n        n=2? -> NO.\n        n=3? -> YES (k=2, r=2).\n\n        However, the example input:\n\n            Input: ['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n            Output: ['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\n        So for n=3 -> YES, but our example output says:\n\n            1: NO\n            2: NO\n            3: NO   (according to the example output) -> wait, the example output says:\n\n            Input: \n                9\n                1\n                2\n                3\n                6\n                13\n                15\n                255\n                10101\n                1000000000000000000\n\n            Output:\n                NO\n                NO\n                NO\n                NO\n                YES\n                YES\n                YES\n                YES\n                NO\n\n        So n=3 is NO, but our reasoning says n=3 is YES (k=2, r=2). \n\n        Let me double-check the example: \n\n            n=3: \n                k=2, then the snowflake has:\n                    Layer0: 1\n                    Layer1: 2 (from center)\n                    Then we must do at least one expansion from leaves (so layer2): each leaf (2 leaves) is expanded to 2 new leaves, so we add 2*2=4 more vertices. Then total = 1+2+4=7, which is not 3.\n\n        What's going on?\n\n        The problem says: \n            Step 1: initial vertex connected to k new -> then we have 1+k = 1+2=3.\n            Then, the step (expanding leaves) must be done at least once. But wait, after step 1, we have 3 vertices. Now, the leaves are the two new vertices (each has degree 1). Then we must expand each leaf: so we add k new vertices for each leaf. That means we add 2 * 2 = 4 new vertices. Then total becomes 3+4=7.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal snowflake for k=2 is 7, not 3.\n\n        So the equation for r=2 (which corresponds to two expansions? Actually, no: the equation (k^r-1)/(k-1) for r=2 gives:\n\n            (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1.\n\n        But note: the number of expansions (layers) is r (the exponent in the numerator) but the series includes the center and then the next r-1 rings? Actually, the series is from exponent 0 to r-1, so the number of layers (including the center) is r. \n\n        The problem requires at least two expansions: the first expansion (from center) and then one expansion from the leaves. Therefore, the minimal is r=3 (three layers: center, first ring, second ring). \n\n        Then the minimal n is for k=2, r=3: (2^3-1)/(2-1)=7.\n\n        But wait, the example output says n=3 is NO, which matches because 3 is not 7.\n\n        Then why is n=13 YES?\n\n        Let me check: n=13.\n\n        We need to check if there exists k>1 and r>=3 (since minimal layers is 3) such that:\n\n            (k^r - 1) / (k-1) = 13\n\n        Possibilities:\n\n          r=3: (k^3-1)/(k-1)=k^2+k+1=13 -> k^2+k-12=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(1+48) )/2 = ( -1±7 )/2 -> k=3 (positive). So k=3, r=3: n=1+3+9=13. Correct.\n\n        Then n=15: \n\n          r=3: (k^3-1)/(k-1)=k^2+k+1=15 -> k^2+k-14=0 -> discriminant=57, not a perfect square -> no.\n          r=4: (k^4-1)/(k-1)=k^3+k^2+k+1=15 -> k^3+k^2+k-14=0. Try k=2: 8+4+2-14=0? 8+4+2=14 -> 14-14=0 -> yes. So k=2, r=4: n=1+2+4+8=15. Correct.\n\n        Then n=255:\n\n          r=3: k^2+k+1=255 -> k^2+k-254=0 -> discriminant=1+1016=1017 (not a perfect square).\n          r=4: k^3+k^2+k+1=255 -> k^3+k^2+k=254. k=6: 216+36+6=258 -> too big. k=5: 125+25+5=155, k=6 too big -> no.\n          r=5: k^4+k^3+k^2+k+1=255. k=3: 81+27+9+3+1=121, k=4: 256+64+16+4+1=341 -> too big. k=3 gives 121, k=4 too big -> no.\n          r=6: k^5+...+1=255. k=2: 64+32+16+8+4+2+1=127, k=3: 3^5=243, then 243+81+27+9+3+1=364 -> too big. k=2 gives 127, k=3 too big -> no.\n          r=7: k=2: 128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255. So (2^8-1)/(2-1)=255. So r=8? Wait, the formula for r layers (exponents from 0 to r-1) is (k^r-1)/(k-1). Here, we used k=2 and r=8: (2^8-1)/(2-1)=255. But note: the minimal layers is 3, but 8 is allowed. So n=255 is YES.\n\n        Then n=10101:\n\n          We need to check for r from 2 to about 60? But note: minimal r is 3, so r>=3.\n\n          We can try r=3,4,... until the minimal base k=2 gives a sum exceeding 10101.\n\n          For k=2: \n            r=3: 7\n            r=4: 15\n            r=5: 31\n            r=6: 63\n            r=7: 127\n            r=8: 255\n            r=9: 511\n            r=10: 1023\n            r=11: 2047\n            r=12: 4095\n            r=13: 8191\n            r=14: 16383 -> too big.\n\n          So for k=2, we have up to r=13.\n\n          But we need to check for other k as well.\n\n          Alternatively, we can iterate over r from 3 to, say, 60, and for each r, solve for k (if the equation is a polynomial of degree r-1, we can use the fact that k must be integer and the equation is monotonic to check if there is an integer solution).\n\n          However, note: the equation for fixed r is:\n\n                n = (k^r - 1) / (k-1)\n\n          We can use binary search for k in the range [2, floor(n^(1/(r-1)))] for each r.\n\n        But note: the example input has n=1000000000000000000 (10^18). We cannot iterate over r from 3 to 60 and for each r do a binary search for k (with a range that can be as large as 10^18^(1/(r-1)) which for r=3 is 10^9, which is acceptable for binary search (log2(10^9) is 30) but for r=2 we already saw that we don't need to consider r=2 (minimal layers is 3) so we start from r=3.\n\n        However, note: the minimal layers is 3 (r=3) and the equation for r=3 is:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2\n\n        We can solve this quadratic equation:\n\n            k^2 + k + 1 - n = 0\n\n            k = [-1 ± sqrt(1-4*(1-n)]/2 = [-1 ± sqrt(4*n-3)]/2\n\n        Then k must be a positive integer, so:\n\n            discriminant = 4*n-3 must be a perfect square, and then (-1+sqrt(4*n-3)) must be even.\n\n        Similarly, for r=4:\n\n            n = 1+k+k^2+k^3\n\n            We can solve for k: \n\n                k^3 + k^2 + k + 1 - n = 0\n\n            This is a cubic equation. We can use binary search for k in [2, floor(n^(1/3))].\n\n        Algorithm for a given n:\n\n          If n < 7: then NO (because minimal n is 7).\n\n          Then, for r from 3 to max_r (where max_r is the smallest integer such that 2^r > n+1, i.e., r <= log2(n+1)):\n\n            We want to know if there exists an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n                n = (k^r - 1) / (k-1)\n\n            We can use binary search for k in the range [2, floor(n^(1/(r-1)))] (note: k^(r-1) <= n, so k <= n^(1/(r-1))). \n\n            However, note: the equation is:\n\n                (k^r - 1) / (k-1) = n\n\n            We can compute the left-hand side for a candidate k and compare to n.\n\n            Steps for fixed r:\n\n                low = 2\n                high = int(round(n**(1/(r-1)))) + 1   # but careful: we need to take the integer part.\n\n            But note: k^(r-1) <= n, so k <= floor(n^(1/(r-1))). However, we can set high = 2 while (2**(r-1)) <= n: then we can set high = 10**6 or something? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                high = 1000000000000000000  # but that is too big.\n\n            We can set high = n if r==2, but we are not considering r=2.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a central vertex, with each subsequent layer expanding by connecting \\( k \\) new vertices to each leaf vertex from the previous layer. The key observation is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must satisfy a specific geometric series condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph is built in layers. The first layer (center) has 1 vertex. Each subsequent layer \\( i \\) (for \\( i \\geq 1 \\)) adds \\( k^i \\) vertices. The total number of vertices after \\( m \\) layers (including the center) is given by the geometric series sum \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\). This can be rewritten as \\( n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\), where \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 1 \\) (ensuring at least two layers).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists integers \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 1 \\) such that \\( n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). Since \\( n \\) can be as large as \\( 10^{18} \\), we need an efficient method to verify this without brute-forcing all possible values of \\( k \\) and \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Iterate Over Possible Layers (m)**: For each test case, iterate over possible values of \\( m \\) (number of layers minus one) starting from 2 up to a maximum where \\( 2^m \\leq n \\). This limits the number of iterations to around 60 for \\( n \\leq 10^{18} \\).\n   - **Binary Search for Base (k)**: For each \\( m \\), use binary search to find an integer \\( k > 1 \\) such that \\( n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\). The binary search range is determined by \\( k \\) being at least 2 and at most \\( \\sqrt[m]{n} \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: For each test case, the algorithm checks up to 60 values of \\( m \\). For each \\( m \\), it performs a binary search which takes \\( O(\\log(\\text{upper\\_bound})) \\) steps. Given the constraints, this approach efficiently handles the problem within feasible time limits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_power(x, r):\n    low = 2\n    high = x\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        power = pow(mid, r)\n        if power == x:\n            return True\n        elif power < x:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    out_lines = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n_val = int(data[index]); index += 1\n        if n_val < 7:\n            out_lines.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        \n        found = False\n        max_exponent = 1\n        temp = 1\n        while temp <= n_val:\n            max_exponent += 1\n            temp *= 2\n        max_exponent -= 1\n        \n        for m in range(2, max_exponent + 1):\n            low_k = 2\n            high_k = 10**18\n            while low_k <= high_k:\n                mid_k = (low_k + high_k) // 2\n                try:\n                    total = (pow(mid_k, m + 1) - 1) // (mid_k - 1)\n                except ZeroDivisionError:\n                    total = None\n                if total is None:\n                    low_k = mid_k + 1\n                    continue\n                \n                if total == n_val:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                elif total < n_val:\n                    low_k = mid_k + 1\n                else:\n                    high_k = mid_k - 1\n                    \n            if found:\n                break\n                \n        if found:\n            out_lines.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            out_lines.append(\"NO\")\n            \n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Check**: If \\( n \\) is less than 7, it's immediately deemed impossible since the smallest valid snowflake (with \\( k=2 \\) and \\( m=2 \\)) requires 7 vertices.\n3. **Binary Search for Valid \\( k \\)**: For each possible layer count \\( m \\), the algorithm checks if there exists a base \\( k \\) such that the geometric series sum equals \\( n \\).
