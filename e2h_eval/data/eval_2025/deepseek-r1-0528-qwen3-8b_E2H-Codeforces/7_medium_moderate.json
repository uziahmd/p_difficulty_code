The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given up to 10^4 test cases, each with an integer n (from 1 to 10^18).\n We need to determine if there exists an integer k > 1 such that a snowflake graph with n vertices exists.\n\n According to the problem, the snowflake is constructed in layers (steps). The initial step (step 0) has 1 vertex.\n Then, step 1: the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices -> total vertices = 1 + k.\n Then, step 2: each vertex that has degree 1 (i.e., the leaves from the previous step) gets connected to k new vertices. \n But note: the central vertex already has k edges so it is not a leaf. However, at step 2, we have k leaves from step 1, and each of these k leaves will be connected to k new vertices. So we add k*k vertices. Then total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (i.e., leaves) is connected by edges to k more new vertices, and this step is done at least once. \n\n The construction process:\n   Step 0: center (1 vertex)\n   Step 1: center connects to k -> total vertices = 1 + k\n   Step 2: the k leaves from step 1 each connect to k new ones -> total vertices = 1 + k + k^2\n   Step 3: the leaves from step 2 (which are k^2 vertices) each connect to k new ones -> total vertices = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3\n\n But note: the problem states that the step of connecting leaves to k new vertices must be done at least once. So step 1 is mandatory, but then we can do step 2, step 3, etc.\n\n However, note that after the first expansion (step 1) we have k leaves. In step 2, we are going to add k*k, but note: the leaves from step 1 now become non-leaves (they have two edges: one to the center and one to their parent? Actually, wait: the rule says \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex\" (so leaves) get expanded. After step 1, the center has k edges and the others have 1 edge. Then in step 2, the leaves (the k vertices) are expanded: each leaf adds k new edges (so now that leaf has 1 (from center) + k (to its children) = k+1 edges, and the center remains with k edges). Then in step 3, the leaves from step 2 (which are k*k vertices) are expanded.\n\n Therefore, the total number of vertices after m steps (with m>=1) is:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we do exactly m steps for some m>=1. However, we can stop at any step. So n must be representable as the sum of a geometric series with base k (k>1) and at least two terms (since we must do the first expansion at least once).\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify the number of expansions (steps). So we require:\n\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for some integers k>1 and m>=1.\n\n But note: the example input includes 6 and the answer is NO. Let's check:\n\n   For k=2: \n        m=1: 1+2 = 3 -> n=3\n        m=2: 1+2+4=7\n        m=3: 15, etc.\n\n   For k=3:\n        m=1: 1+3=4\n        m=2: 1+3+9=13 -> YES for n=13\n\n   Why is 6 NO? \n        We need to check if 6 can be written as 1 + k + ... for some k>1 and m>=1.\n\n        k=2: 1+2 = 3, 1+2+4=7 -> doesn't give 6.\n        k=3: 1+3=4, 1+3+9=13 -> no.\n        k=4: 1+4=5, 1+4+16=21 -> no.\n\n        So 6 is not representable.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the entire expansion to be done. But the expansion is defined as: the initial vertex is connected to k new (that's step1). Then each leaf (from step1) is connected to k new (step2). But we are allowed to stop at any step.\n\n Therefore, n must be the sum of a geometric series with ratio k (integer) and at least two terms (because m>=1). Also note that k>1.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the entire expansion is done the same number of times for every branch? Actually, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\" This implies that we expand all leaves at the same time. So the entire snowflake is built in layers (steps). So the representation is fixed: n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to stop at any step. So we are looking for:\n\n   n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)   for some integers k>1 and m>=1.\n\n But note: k must be an integer greater than 1, and m>=1.\n\n However, n can be very large (up to 10^18). We cannot iterate over k from 2 to ... because k might be huge.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n   We note that for fixed m, we can solve for k. But m can be from 1 to about 60 (because 2^60 is around 1e18).\n\n   Alternatively, note that the equation:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n   is equivalent to:\n\n        n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)\n\n   We can consider:\n\n        k^(m+1) = n*(k-1) + 1\n\n   But solving for k is difficult.\n\n Another idea: we know that the minimal representation for a given n (if it exists) would have the smallest k. Also, note that k must be at least 2.\n\n   For m=1: n = 1 + k  => k = n-1. Then we require k>1, so n>=3. But also, we must have k>1 and integer, which is satisfied for any n>=3. However, wait: what if n=3? Then k=2 -> valid. But then why is n=2 output as NO? Because for n=2: \n        We require k>1, so for m=1: k = n-1 = 1 -> not allowed (k>1). And m>=1, so we must have at least one expansion. Then we cannot use m=1. What about m>=2?\n\n   However, note: the expansion must be done at least once (so m>=1). But we can also consider that the entire process must be done in integer steps.\n\n   But note: the problem does not say we have to use the minimal k. It just says \"exists k>1\". \n\n   However, let's break down:\n\n   Case 1: n=1 -> NO (because k>1 is required and we must do at least one expansion, so we cannot have 1 vertex).\n\n   Case 2: n=2 -> NO: because with k>1, minimum expansion gives 1+k (with k>=2) so minimum n is 3.\n\n   Case 3: n=3 -> YES: k=2, m=1.\n\n   Now, how about n=4?\n        m=1: k = 3 -> valid (k=3>1). So YES.\n\n   But wait, the example input has:\n        Input: 1 -> NO, 2->NO, 3->NO, 6->NO, 13->YES, 15->YES, 255->YES, 10101->YES, 1000000000000000000->NO.\n\n   However, our reasoning for n=3: \n        n=3: k=2, m=1 -> 1+2=3 -> YES.\n\n   But the example output says for n=3: \"NO\".\n\n   Wait, let me check the example input again:\n\n        Input: \n            ['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n        Output: \n            ['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\n        So n=3 is output as \"NO\".\n\n   Why is n=3 considered NO?\n\n   Let me reexamine the problem statement:\n\n        \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n\n        Then, the next step: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n   So note: the step of connecting leaves to k new vertices must be done at least once. That means we must have at least two expansions? \n\n   Actually, read carefully: the first expansion (from the center) is mandatory (k>1). Then, the next expansion (on the leaves) must be done at least once.\n\n   Wait, the problem says: \"This step should be done at least once.\" referring to the step of expanding the leaves. But note the first expansion is not called \"this step\". The first expansion is the initial step. Then \"this step\" is the expansion of leaves.\n\n   So the process is:\n\n      Step0: 1 vertex (center)\n      Step1: center expands to k new -> then we have 1+k vertices. Now, the center has k edges and the k new ones have 1 edge.\n      Then we must do the leaf expansion at least once: meaning we must do Step2: each leaf (the k vertices) expands to k new -> then we have 1+k+k^2.\n\n   So the minimal snowflake must have at least two expansions: step1 and step2? Then minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n   But wait, the problem says: \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\" and then \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n   The two sentences: the first expansion is separate from the step that must be done at least once. So the minimal process is:\n\n      Step0: 1 vertex.\n      Step1 (mandatory): center expands to k new (now n=1+k).\n      Then, we must do the leaf expansion at least once (so step2: expand the k leaves to k*k new, so n becomes 1+k+k^2).\n\n   Therefore, we must have at least two layers beyond the center? Actually, no: the center is the first layer, then the first expansion (step1) gives the second layer, then the leaf expansion (step2) gives the third layer. \n\n   But note: the problem says \"This step [expanding leaves] should be done at least once\", meaning we must do the leaf expansion at least one time. So the minimal n is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n   However, wait: what if we do only the first expansion and then stop? Then we have n=1+k. But the problem requires that the leaf expansion step is done at least once. So we must do the leaf expansion at least once. Therefore, the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n   Then:\n\n        n=3: 1+k+k^2 = 3 -> k^2+k-2=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(1+8))/2 = (-1±3)/2 -> k=1 or k=-2. But k>1 and integer, so no solution.\n\n        n=4: 1+k+k^2=4 -> k^2+k-3=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(13))/2 -> not integer.\n\n        n=13: 1+k+k^2+k^3=13? Or wait, we can have different numbers of steps.\n\n   Actually, the problem allows multiple steps. The process is:\n\n        Start with 1 vertex (step0).\n        Step1: add k -> total 1+k.\n        Then, we do the leaf expansion (step2): add k*k -> total 1+k+k^2.\n        Then, we can do step3: add k^3, etc.\n\n   But note: we must do the leaf expansion at least once. So the minimal expansion is two steps (step1 and step2). But we can do more.\n\n   So n must be equal to:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for some integer m>=2 (since we must do at least two steps: the initial expansion and then at least one leaf expansion) and integer k>1.\n\n   However, wait: the problem says the initial expansion is the first thing, and then the leaf expansion must be done at least once. So the entire process must have at least two expansions? Actually, the center expansion is the first expansion, and then the leaf expansion is the second expansion. So the minimal number of expansions is 2, meaning we have three layers: center, then the first ring, then the second ring.\n\n   But note: the example for k=4: the smallest snowflake (from the figure) has 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1+4+16=21 vertices? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"The smallest possible snowflake for k = 4\" is shown. So the minimal for k=4 is 21.\n\n   But then why is 13 YES? 13 = 1 + 3 + 9, so k=3 and m=2 (two expansions: step1 and step2). So that matches.\n\n   So the condition is: n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m>=1 (wait, wait: the leaf expansion must be done at least once, meaning the entire process must include at least two expansions? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        Step1: center expansion (mandatory, k>1).\n        Then, the leaf expansion (at least once).\n\n   So the total expansions (layers) is m+1, where m is the number of leaf expansion steps (so m>=1). Then the total layers is 2 (center and the first ring) plus m rings from the leaf expansions. \n\n   Alternatively, we can think of the number of expansions (including the center expansion) as being at least 2 (the center expansion and one leaf expansion). But note: the center expansion is the first expansion, then the leaf expansion is the second expansion. So the entire graph has two types of expansions: the center expansion (step1) and then the leaf expansion (step2). \n\n   However, note the example: the center expansion is the first expansion, and then the leaf expansion is the second expansion. But the problem says the leaf expansion must be done at least once, so we must have at least two expansions (the center expansion and one leaf expansion). Therefore, the minimal representation is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2   (m=1, meaning one leaf expansion)\n\n   Then the equation for n is:\n\n        n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for some integer m>=1 (because we must do the leaf expansion at least once, so m is the number of leaf expansion steps, and the center expansion is always there).\n\n   But wait, the center expansion is not counted in m? Let me clarify:\n\n        Let m be the number of leaf expansion steps (so m>=1). Then the total layers (including the center) is m+1.\n\n        The center: 1 vertex.\n        Then, we do m+1 expansions? Actually, we do:\n\n          Step0: center (1 vertex)\n          Step1: center expands (first expansion) -> adds k\n          Step2: leaf expansion (second expansion) -> adds k^2\n          ...\n          Step (m+1): the last leaf expansion adds k^(m+1) ?\n\n        Actually, the number of expansions (the operations) is m+1 (one center expansion and m leaf expansions). Then the total vertices is:\n\n          n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n        because the center expansion adds k (which is k^1) and the first leaf expansion adds k^2, the next adds k^3, etc. until k^m.\n\n        But note: the center expansion is the first expansion, and then the leaf expansion is the second expansion, so the exponents go from 1 to m.\n\n        Therefore, we have:\n\n          n = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1)   for m>=1 and k>1.\n\n   Now, let's check n=3: \n        We require m>=1 and k>1, then n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m >= 1 + k + k^2 (if m>=2) OR if m=1 then n=1+k.\n\n        For m=1: n=1+k -> k=n-1, and k>1 so n>=3. But then for n=3: k=2, which is >1 -> so n=3 would be YES if m=1 is allowed.\n\n        However, according to the problem statement, the leaf expansion must be done at least once. But note: the center expansion is the first expansion, and the leaf expansion is the second expansion. In the case m=1, we are doing two expansions: center expansion (step1) and one leaf expansion (step2). \n\n        But wait, the problem says:\n\n            \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n            Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n        The center expansion is the first part, and the leaf expansion (the second part) must be done at least once.\n\n        So the minimal case is two expansions (center expansion and one leaf expansion) which gives n=1+k+k^2. \n\n        But wait, the problem does not say that the center expansion must be followed by the leaf expansion? It says:\n\n            Step1: center expansion (k>1)\n            Then, the leaf expansion must be done at least once.\n\n        So the center expansion is done, then the leaf expansion is done at least once. Therefore, the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n        Then n=3: 1+k+k^2=3 -> k^2+k-2=0 -> k= ( -1 ± sqrt(1+8) )/2 = ( -1±3 )/2 -> k=1 or k=-2 -> invalid. So n=3 is NO.\n\n        Similarly, n=4: 1+k+k^2=4 -> k^2+k-3=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(13) )/2 -> not integer. Then we try m=2 (two leaf expansions): n=1+k+k^2+k^3=4 -> k^3+k^2+k-3=0. k>1, so k=1: 1+1+1-3=0? but k=1 not allowed. k=2: 8+4+2-3=11 !=0. So n=4 is NO.\n\n        n=5: 1+k+k^2=5 -> k^2+k-4=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(17) )/2 -> not integer. Then m=2: 1+k+k^2+k^3=5 -> k^3+k^2+k-4=0 -> k=1: 1+1+1-4=-1; k=2: 8+4+2-4=10 -> no.\n\n        n=6: 1+k+k^2=6 -> k^2+k-5=0 -> k=( -1±sqrt(21) )/2 -> no. Then m=2: 1+k+k^2+k^3=6 -> k^3+k^2+k-5=0 -> k=1: 1+1+1-5=-2; k=2: 8+4+2-5=9 -> no.\n\n        n=7: m=1: 1+k=7 -> k=6 -> valid (k>1). But wait, with m=1 we are only doing one leaf expansion? Actually, no: the formula for m=1 is 1+k (the center expansion) and then we must do the leaf expansion at least once (so m>=1). But note: the problem says the leaf expansion must be done at least once. \n\n        However, if we do the center expansion and then one leaf expansion, then we have two expansions (center and leaf) and the total is 1+k+k^2. But wait, the problem says:\n\n            Step1: center expansion (k new) -> n=1+k.\n            Then, the leaf expansion (must be done at least once) -> then we must add k^2, so n becomes 1+k+k^2.\n\n        So actually, the minimal representation for any k is 1+k+k^2. But wait, the problem does not say that we must do the leaf expansion immediately after the center expansion? Or that we must do the center expansion and then the leaf expansion in sequence?\n\n        Let me read again: \n\n            \"Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k > 1).\"\n\n            Then, \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\n        This implies that the center expansion happens first, and then the leaf expansion (which applies to all leaves from the center expansion) must be done at least once. Then we can optionally do more leaf expansions.\n\n        Therefore, the total number of vertices must be at least 1+k+k^2 (for the center expansion and one leaf expansion). \n\n        However, note that after the center expansion, we have k leaves. Then we do the leaf expansion: each leaf is replaced by k new leaves (so we remove the leaf and add k-1 new leaves? Actually, no: the problem says \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices.\" \n\n        This means: we take a leaf (which is connected to only the center) and then we add k new vertices, and we connect the leaf to these k new ones. But note: the leaf was already connected to the center. Then the leaf now has k edges (one to the center and k to the new ones). The new ones have one edge (to the leaf). Then the new ones become leaves.\n\n        So the count: \n            Start: center and k leaves (after center expansion).\n            Then, for each leaf (there are k leaves), we add k new vertices. So we add k*k = k^2 vertices.\n\n        Then the total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal n is 1+k+k^2.\n\n        Then the equation is:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for some integer m>=1 (because we must do the leaf expansion at least once, so m is the number of leaf expansion steps, and the center expansion is included in the base) but wait, the center expansion is the first term (k^1) and then the leaf expansions are k^2, k^3, ... up to k^m.\n\n        Actually, the expansion process:\n\n            Layer0: center (1 vertex)\n            Layer1: center expansion (k vertices) -> adds k^1\n            Layer2: first leaf expansion (k^2 vertices) -> adds k^2\n            Layer3: second leaf expansion (k^3 vertices) -> adds k^3\n\n        So the total is: 1 + k^1 + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m>=1.\n\n        Then for n=3: \n            We require 1 + k + ... + k^m = 3, with k>1 and m>=1.\n\n            If m=1: 1+k=3 -> k=2 -> then we have 1+2=3. But wait, does this satisfy the condition? \n\n            Condition: \n                Step1: center expansion: we have 1+2=3 vertices. Then we must do the leaf expansion at least once. But wait, after the center expansion, we have two leaves. Then we must do the leaf expansion (at least once) on these two leaves. \n\n            However, if we do the leaf expansion, we would have:\n\n                n becomes 1+2+2^2=7.\n\n            So the representation for n=3 is only the center expansion (without the leaf expansion). But the problem requires that the leaf expansion is done at least once.\n\n            Therefore, n=3 is not valid.\n\n        Now, what about n=7? \n            Without leaf expansion, we have 3. But we must do the leaf expansion at least once, so the minimal representation for k=2 is 1+2+4=7.\n\n        So the representation must include the center expansion and at least one leaf expansion. Therefore, the minimal representation is 1+k+k^2 (for m=1, meaning one leaf expansion).\n\n        Then the equation is:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m   for some integer m>=1 and integer k>1.\n\n        But note: the center expansion is the first term (k^1) and the leaf expansions are the rest (k^2, k^3, ...). \n\n        Therefore, the minimal n for a given k is 1+k+k^2 (m=1). \n\n        Then we must have:\n\n            n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^m   for m>=1 and k>1.\n\n        How to check for a given n (up to 10^18) if there exists integers k>1 and m>=1 such that:\n\n            n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n        We can consider:\n\n            For a fixed m (from 1 to, say, 60, because 2^60 ~ 1e18), we can solve for k.\n\n            Note: the equation is:\n\n                n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n\n            We can write:\n\n                n*(k-1) = k^(m+1)-1\n\n            Then k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\n        However, we cannot iterate k from 2 to ... because k might be very large (but note: m is at most 60, and n<=10^18, so k is at most around 10^18^(1/(m+1)) which for m=1 is about sqrt(n) which is 1e9, too many to iterate.\n\n        Alternative: for fixed m, we can use binary search for k? But k must be integer.\n\n        Another idea: since m is small (from 1 to about 60), we can iterate over m from 2 to 60? Actually, note: the minimal representation is m=1 (then n=1+k+k^2) but wait, we are including the center expansion (k^1) and one leaf expansion (k^2). So m=1 gives two layers (center expansion and one leaf expansion). \n\n        But note: the problem requires at least one leaf expansion (so m>=1). Then we can consider m from 1 to about 60.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          For a given n, we try all m from 1 to 60 (because 2^60 is about 1e18, so m=60 gives k^61 which is too big for k>=2, so we can set m_max = floor(log2(n))+1, but n can be 1, but we skip n=1 because we require m>=1 and k>=2 so minimal n is 1+2+4=7). \n\n          For each m, we want to find an integer k>1 such that:\n\n                n = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1)\n\n          Rearranged:\n\n                k^(m+1) = n*(k-1)+1\n\n          But we can also express:\n\n                (k^(m+1)-1) = n*(k-1)\n\n          We can try to solve for k. Since k is integer and k>1, we can use binary search for k in the range [2, ?]\n\n          However, note that k must be at least 2, and the left side (k^(m+1)) grows very fast. We can set an upper bound for k: \n\n                k^(m+1) <= n*(k-1)+1   and k>=2.\n\n          We can start from k=2 and go upward until the left side exceeds n*(k-1)+1, but note that for fixed m, the left side is exponential in k. However, k is the base and m is fixed, so we can use binary search for k.\n\n          But note: the equation is:\n\n                f(k) = (k^(m+1)-1) // (k-1) = n\n\n          We can compute the value for k and compare with n.\n\n          However, n can be as large as 10^18, and m is at most 60, so the exponentiation k^(m+1) for k=10^18 and m=60 is astronomical. We need a smarter way.\n\n        Another approach: for fixed m, we can use binary search for k. But note: k is at least 2 and at most ... well, the maximum k for which (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) <= n. \n\n        We can set an upper bound for k: \n\n            (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) <= n   =>  k^(m+1) <= n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        We can also note that k is at least 2 and the function is increasing in k.\n\n        We can use binary search for k in the range [2, n] (but n is 10^18, so we cannot iterate). However, note that for fixed m, k is not too large. Because:\n\n            k^(m+1) is approximately n*(k-1). \n\n        Alternatively, we can solve for k by taking logarithms? \n\n        But note: we are dealing with integers. We can use Newton's method or simply iterate k from 2 to a limit. However, the limit for k: \n\n            For m=1: \n                n = 1 + k + k^2 = k^2+k+1.\n                Then k^2+k+1 <= n -> k^2 < n, so k <= sqrt(n). For n=10^18, sqrt(n)=1e9, which is too many to iterate.\n\n        We need a better way.\n\n        Instead, we can use the fact that m is fixed and small (from 1 to 60). We can use binary search for k for each m. The range for k is from 2 to ...? \n\n        We note that:\n\n            (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) <= n\n\n            => k^(m+1) <= n*(k-1)+1\n\n        For k=2, we can compute the left side easily. But for larger k, we can use an upper bound.\n\n        Since the left side grows very fast, we can set the upper bound for k as follows:\n\n            Let k_min = 2, k_max = 2\n            We know that for k=2, the value is (2^(m+1)-1)/(2-1) = 2^(m+1)-1.\n\n            If 2^(m+1)-1 > n, then k=2 is too big. Otherwise, we need a larger k.\n\n        Actually, we can set an upper bound: \n\n            k^(m+1) <= n*(k-1)+1\n\n            For k>=2, we have k^(m+1) <= n*k + n   (since n*(k-1)+1 <= n*k + n)\n\n            Then k^m <= n + n/k   (dividing by k) -> not helpful.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n            We know that the sum of the geometric series is at most (k^(m+1))/(k-1) <= k^(m+1)/(k-1) <= n.\n\n            Then k^(m+1) <= n*(k-1)+1.\n\n        We can use binary search for k from 2 to, say, n (but n is huge). However, note that k is at most around n^(1/m) (if we ignore the other terms). \n\n        Example: for m=1, the equation is k^2+k+1 = n, so k is about sqrt(n). For n=10^18, sqrt(n)=1e9, which is too many for a linear scan.\n\n        But we can use binary search for k for fixed m. The function f(k) = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) is increasing in k. We can set:\n\n            low = 2\n            high = 2\n            while (high)^(m+1)-1)/(high-1) < n:\n                high *= 2\n\n            Then we have an interval [2, high] and we can do binary search.\n\n        However, even for m=1, we might end up with high being 2^30 (about 1e9) for n=10^18, which is acceptable for binary search (log2(1e9) is about 30 steps). But wait, for m=1, the equation is quadratic, so the k is about sqrt(n). Then we set high initially to 2, then double until we get an upper bound. The doubling steps: we start at 2, then 4, 8, 16, ... until we exceed n. For n=10^18, the k for m=1 is about sqrt(10^18)=1e9, so we need to double until we get to 2^30 (which is about 1e9) so about 30 steps. Then the binary search will take about 30 steps. Then we do this for each m from 1 to 60, so 60*30 = 1800 iterations per test case.\n\n        But note: t can be up to 10000 test cases. Then 10000 * 1800 = 18e6, which is acceptable in Python if we optimize the exponentiation.\n\n        However, note that for m>=2, the exponentiation k^(m+1) for k=1e9 and m=60 is impossible (the number is too big). But we don't need to compute the full number if we are using logarithms? Actually, we can use logarithms to avoid huge numbers? But we are comparing integers.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the fact that for large m, k must be small. Because the series 1+k+k^2+...+k^m grows very fast with k and m. \n\n        We can break the loop for m when the minimal value for the series (with k=2) is already greater than n.\n\n        Steps for a given test case n:\n\n            if n == 1: \n                return \"NO\"\n\n            Let m_min = 1, and m_max = 60 (or until 2^(m+1)-1 > n, but note the series with k=2 for m steps: 1+2+2^2+...+2^m = 2^(m+1)-1, and if 2^(m+1)-1 > n, then for k=2 we are already above n, but maybe a larger k? Actually, k>=2, so if k=2 already gives a series exceeding n, then for that m, there is no k? Not necessarily: if k=3, then the series grows even faster. \n\n        Actually, we are iterating m from 1 to 60, and for each m, we are searching for an integer k>=2 such that:\n\n            S(m, k) = (k^(m+1)-1)/(k-1) = n\n\n        We can do:\n\n            for m in range(1, 61):\n                # Find an integer k>=2 such that S(m,k)=n.\n\n                #",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a central vertex, followed by layers of vertices added according to specific rules. The key insight is that the total number of vertices in such a graph must be the sum of a geometric series with integer base \\( k > 1 \\) and at least two terms (since the leaf expansion must be performed at least once).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph starts with a single central vertex. The first expansion adds \\( k \\) new vertices connected to the center. Each subsequent expansion adds \\( k^2, k^3, \\ldots, k^m \\) vertices, where \\( m \\geq 1 \\). Thus, the total number of vertices \\( n \\) must satisfy \\( n = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\) for some integers \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 1 \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each test case, we need to check if \\( n \\) can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series with an integer base \\( k > 1 \\) and at least two terms. Given the constraints \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18} \\), we iterate over possible values of \\( m \\) (from 1 to 60, since \\( 2^{60} \\) exceeds \\( 10^{18} \\)) and for each \\( m \\), perform a binary search to find an integer \\( k \\) such that the sum of the geometric series equals \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each \\( m \\), compute the minimal and maximal possible \\( k \\) values using binary search. The sum of the geometric series \\( S(m, k) = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} \\) must equal \\( n \\). The binary search efficiently narrows down the possible \\( k \\) values by leveraging the monotonic nature of \\( S(m, k) \\) with respect to \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each test case by checking up to 60 values of \\( m \\). For each \\( m \\), it performs a binary search over a range of \\( k \\) values, which is logarithmic in the upper bound of \\( k \\). Given the constraints, this approach efficiently handles up to \\( 10^4 \\) test cases.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    tests = [int(x) for x in data[1:1+t]]\n    \n    results = []\n    for n in tests:\n        if n < 7:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n            continue\n            \n        found = False\n        for m in range(1, 61):\n            low = 2\n            high = 2\n            while (high ** (m+1) - 1) // (high - 1) < n:\n                high *= 2\n                if high > n:\n                    break\n                    \n            k_found = None\n            while low <= high:\n                mid = (low + high) // 2\n                try:\n                    total = (mid**(m+1) - 1) // (mid - 1)\n                except:\n                    total = None\n                    \n                if total == n:\n                    k_found = mid\n                    break\n                elif total < n:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n                    \n            if k_found is not None:\n                found = True\n                break\n                \n        results.append(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n        \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Check**: If \\( n \\) is less than 7, it's impossible to form a valid snowflake graph (since the smallest valid graph has \\( 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \\) vertices).\n3. **Binary Search for Valid \\( k \\)**: For each possible layer count \\( m \\) (from 1 to 60), the algorithm determines an upper bound for \\( k \\) by doubling a starting value until the geometric series sum exceeds \\( n \\).
