    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (possibly overlapping).\n 3. We can consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates, but since n<=100, we can do this without too much worry.\n\n However, note: We need the longest substring that appears at least twice. So we can iterate over possible lengths from the maximum (n-1) down to 1, and for each length, check if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a set for each length? But we want the longest one.\n\n Approach:\n Let n = len(s)\n We'll start by checking the largest possible substring (which is the entire string) and then go down until we find one that appears at least twice.\n\n But note: The problem says \"at least twice\". The entire string might appear twice only if the string is repeated, but we don't require non-overlapping. However, the entire string cannot appear twice unless the string is duplicated, and then we would have found a longer duplicate? Actually, the entire string as a substring can only appear once in the string (unless the string is periodic). But wait: if the string is \"aaa\", then the entire string \"aaa\" appears only once. However, the substring \"aa\" appears multiple times.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the longest substring that appears at least twice. So if we have \"aaa\", then the substring \"aa\" (length 2) appears three times, but also \"a\" (length 1) appears many times. We want the longest, which is 2.\n\n However, what about overlapping? The problem says occurrences can overlap. So for \"aaa\", the substring \"aa\" appears at positions 0 and 1.\n\n Steps:\n  - We can iterate the length from min(n, ...) but we start from the maximum possible duplicate substring length, which is floor((n+1)/2) ??? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, the maximum length of a substring that can appear at least twice is at most floor(n/2) because if we have two non-overlapping occurrences, then the first occurrence must end before the second starts, so 2 * L <= n + 1 (if they can overlap, then actually we can have two overlapping occurrences: for example, in \"abcabc\", the substring \"abc\" of length 3 appears twice and the string length is 6). But wait, the two occurrences can be overlapping. Example: \"ababa\" -> substring \"aba\" (length 3) appears at index0 and index2. The total length is 5, so 3*2=6 which is more than 5, but they overlap.\n\n Actually, the condition for having two occurrences (overlapping allowed) is that the substring of length L must appear at least twice. The starting indices can be any i and j with |i-j| < L.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the two occurrences to be distinct in terms of being non-overlapping. They can overlap arbitrarily.\n\n Since n is at most 100, we can do:\n\n Let ans = 0\n For L in range(floor(n/2), 0, -1):   # We can start from the maximum possible L that could have two occurrences? Actually, the maximum L for which two occurrences can fit is when the two occurrences are as close as possible. The minimal gap is 0 (overlap). The condition is: we need two starting indices i and j such that the substring s[i:i+L] == s[j:j+L]. There is no restriction on the gap between i and j.\n\n However, note: if we have two identical substrings, then the maximum length L for which we can have two occurrences is limited by the entire string. In fact, the maximum L cannot exceed n-1 (because if we take a substring of length n, it can only appear once). Actually, the maximum L for which we can have two occurrences is n-1? Let me think: \n   Example: \"abc\" has n=3. Can we have two substrings of length 2? Yes: \"ab\" and \"bc\". But wait, the entire string is 3, so the maximum L for which two occurrences exist is 2? Then we can have L up to n-1.\n\n But note: if we take a substring of length n, then we have only one occurrence. So the maximum L we need to check is n-1.\n\n However, we are asked for the longest substring that appears at least twice. So we can have a substring of length L (which is n-1) if the string is like \"aab\" then we have \"aa\" (if n=3, then n-1=2) but wait, for n=3, the substring of length 2: \n   s[0:2] = \"aa\", s[1:3] = \"ab\" -> so only \"aa\" appears twice? Actually, no: in \"aab\", the substring \"aa\" appears only once. \n\n Actually, the substring of length L must appear at least twice. So we can have two occurrences of a substring of length L, and these two occurrences must be at different starting indices.\n\n Since n is small, we can do:\n\n   Let s = input string, n = len(s)\n   If n == 0: print(0) and exit.\n\n   We'll check for L from min(n-1, ...) down to 1, but we can also check from max_possible = n-1 down to 1.\n\n   However, note: the two occurrences can be anywhere. We can use a dictionary to record the frequency of each substring of a fixed length? But we are going from large L to small, and we want the first (largest) L for which we find at least one substring that appears at least twice.\n\n   Alternatively, we can iterate over all substrings and record their lengths and frequencies, but then we have to remember the longest one that appears at least twice.\n\n   Since n<=100, the total number of substrings is n*(n+1)//2 which is about 5050, which is acceptable.\n\n   But the problem: we are to output the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice.\n\n   We can do:\n\n     Let seen = {}  # mapping from substring to count (or just a set for each length? Actually, we want the maximum length, so we can store by length? Or we can just record all substrings and their lengths, then take the maximum length for which the count>=2.\n\n   However, we are only required to output the length. We can:\n\n     Option 1: Iterate over all substrings, store them in a dictionary keyed by length, then for each length, if there's at least one substring of that length that appears at least twice, then the answer is that length. Then we choose the maximum length that satisfies the condition.\n\n     But note: we want the longest substring (by length) that appears at least twice. So we can do:\n\n        max_length = 0\n        freq_dict = {}  # key: substring, value: count\n\n        But then we have to remember the length. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let's create a dictionary that maps substring to its frequency. Then we can iterate over the keys and look for the key (substring) that has frequency>=2 and then take the maximum length of such substring.\n\n        However, we are only concerned with the length, so we can do:\n\n        best = 0\n        freq = {}\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n+1):\n                substr = s[i:j]\n                if substr in freq:\n                    freq[substr] += 1\n                else:\n                    freq[substr] = 1\n\n        Then, we can iterate over the freq dictionary and for every substring that has freq>=2, update best = max(best, len(substr))\n\n        But wait, that will give us the maximum length of any substring that appears at least twice. However, note: we are iterating over all substrings. The problem says \"longest substring\", so we are looking for the maximum length.\n\n        Example: \"aaa\" \n          substrings: \n            'a' -> 3 times\n            'aa' -> 2 times\n            'aaa' -> 1 time\n\n          Then we take the substring 'aa' (length 2) because it has frequency 2, and 'a' (length 1) has frequency 3, but 2>1, so answer is 2.\n\n        This method works.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice\". So we are looking for the maximum length L such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n        But note: if a substring of length L appears twice, then any substring of length < L that is contained in it may also appear more, but we don't care about the shorter ones because we are looking for the longest.\n\n        This method will give the correct answer.\n\n        But note: we are storing every substring and counting. The total number of substrings is O(n^2) and n<=100, so maximum 5050 substrings, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can optimize by breaking early? Actually, we are required to output the maximum length, so we must check all substrings.\n\n        But there's an alternative: we can iterate from L = n-1 down to 1, and for each L, check if there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice. Then we break at the first L (largest) that satisfies the condition.\n\n        How to do that?\n\n          for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n              seen = {}\n              for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                  substr = s[i:i+L]\n                  if substr in seen:\n                      seen[substr] += 1\n                  else:\n                      seen[substr] = 1\n                  # If we see a substring with count>=2, we can break out of the inner loop and return L?\n                  # But wait, we are checking for at least two occurrences. We don't know if we've seen two until we finish the inner loop.\n\n              # After the inner loop, check if any substring in seen has count>=2.\n              found = False\n              for count_val in seen.values():\n                  if count_val >= 2:\n                      found = True\n                      break\n\n              if found:\n                  print(L)\n                  exit(0)\n\n          If we don't find any, then we continue to the next (smaller) L.\n\n          But what if no substring appears twice? Then we should output 0.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"at least twice\". It is possible that no substring appears twice? Actually, the empty substring? But the problem says non-empty string, and we are considering non-empty substrings? Actually, the problem doesn't specify that the substring must be non-empty, but the input is non-empty. Also, the example outputs 0 for the first example.\n\n          Example: Input \"abcd\" -> output 0. Because no substring (of positive length?) appears twice.\n\n          But note: the substring must appear at least twice. The empty substring would appear everywhere, but the problem likely considers non-empty substrings? The problem statement does not specify, but the examples: \n            Input: \"abcd\" -> output 0.\n\n          Let's read the problem: \"longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice\". The substring is part of the string, and typically in such problems, we consider contiguous parts. And the example input \"abcd\" has no duplicate substring.\n\n          However, the problem says the string is non-empty and consists of lower-case Latin letters.\n\n          According to the sample: \n            ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] -> ['0','3','2']\n\n          So for \"abcd\": output 0; for \"ababa\": output 3; for \"zzz\": output 2.\n\n          Now, for \"zzz\": \n            Substrings: \n              length 1: 'z' -> appears 3 times -> so we would have found a substring of length 1 that appears 3 times, but we are looking for the longest. However, we are iterating from L=2 (since n=3, then n-1=2) down to 1.\n\n          For L=2: \n            substrings: \"zz\", \"zz\" (from indices 0 and 1). So we have two occurrences of \"zz\". Therefore, we output 2.\n\n          Why didn't we output 1? Because we are iterating from the largest L (which is 2) and we break as soon as we find one. So we output 2.\n\n          But wait, the problem says the longest substring that appears at least twice. In \"zzz\", the substring \"zz\" (length 2) appears twice, and the substring \"z\" (length 1) appears three times. The longest is 2.\n\n          So the method above is correct.\n\n        However, note: the example \"abcd\": \n          n=4, so we check L from 3 down to 1.\n          For L=3: substrings: \"abc\", \"bcd\" -> no duplicate.\n          For L=2: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"cd\" -> no duplicate.\n          For L=1: \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" -> no duplicate. So we output nothing and then after the loop we output 0? Actually, we break only when we find one. We should output 0 if we don't find any.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          ans = 0\n          for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n              seen = {}\n              for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                  substr = s[i:i+L]\n                  seen[substr] = seen.get(substr, 0) + 1\n                  # We can check if we have already two? But we don't know until we finish the inner loop.\n\n              # Now, check in seen: if any value is >=2, then we set ans = L and break.\n              duplicate_found = False\n              for count_val in seen.values():\n                  if count_val >= 2:\n                      duplicate_found = True\n                      break\n\n              if duplicate_found:\n                  ans = L\n                  break\n\n          print(ans)\n\n        But wait, is that efficient? The worst-case scenario: we are iterating for each L from n-1 down to 1, and for each L we iterate over n-L+1 substrings. The total work is about sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1) ~ O(n^2). Since n<=100, the worst-case is about 100^2/2 = 5000, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we can break early in the inner loop if we find a duplicate? Actually, we are storing the entire set for the current L. But we can break early by noticing that if we have already found two occurrences of a substring, we can break the inner loop? But we are storing all substrings for the current L. \n\n        Alternatively, we can break the inner loop when we have already found two of the same substring? But note: we are checking for at least two. However, we might encounter the same substring multiple times. But we are storing the count. \n\n        But we can break the inner loop if we have two of the same substring? Actually, we don't know if the same substring will appear again until we see it. However, we are storing the entire set for the current L. \n\n        Actually, we don't need to store the entire set for the current L if we are only interested in whether there is at least one substring that appears at least twice. We can break the inner loop as soon as we find a substring that we have seen before (so we have at least two occurrences)? \n\n        But note: we are counting the frequency. We can do:\n\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:   # but then we are storing the seen ones, and we haven't updated the count. Actually, we can do:\n\n          We can use a set? No, because we need to know if we have seen it at least once, but we are counting the frequency.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          We are only interested in knowing if there is at least two occurrences of any substring of length L. So we can break the inner loop as soon as we see a substring that we have seen before (even if we have seen it once, then we have two occurrences). But wait, if we see a substring for the second time, then we have two. However, we might see the same substring multiple times, but we don't need to count beyond 2.\n\n        We can modify the inner loop:\n\n          seen = set()\n          for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n              substr = s[i:i+L]\n              if substr in seen:\n                  # We found a duplicate, so we can break and set duplicate_found = True.\n                  break\n              else:\n                  seen.add(substr)\n\n          But wait, what if the same substring appears more than twice? Then we break at the second occurrence. However, we are only checking for at least two.\n\n        However, there is a catch: the same substring might appear twice, but we are storing the set of substrings. We are not storing the frequency. But if we break at the second occurrence, then we don't need the frequency. But note: we are only concerned with existence of at least two.\n\n        But is that correct? Yes, because if we have seen the substring once and then we see it again, then we have two. So we can break.\n\n        However, we must note: the same substring might appear in two different places, but we are storing the set. But if we break at the second occurrence, we don't need to check the rest.\n\n        But what if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the second occurrence and we don't need to check the third.\n\n        But wait: we are storing the set, and we are breaking when we see a substring that is already in the set. That means we break at the second occurrence. \n\n        However, we must consider that the same substring might appear again later, but we break at the second occurrence and that's enough.\n\n        But there's a problem: the two occurrences must be distinct (different starting indices). Our set method doesn't care about the starting index, but we are storing the substring. The substring is the same, so two different occurrences (with different starting indices) of the same substring are two occurrences.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n              seen = set()\n              duplicate_found = False\n              for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                  substr = s[i:i+L]\n                  if substr in seen:\n                      duplicate_found = True\n                      break\n                  else:\n                      seen.add(substr)\n              if duplicate_found:\n                  ans = L\n                  break\n\n        Then, if we break, we output L. Otherwise, we continue.\n\n        But wait, is that correct? What if the same substring appears three times? Then we break at the second occurrence, which is correct.\n\n        However, note: we are not counting the frequency, we are just checking for presence. And we break at the first time we see a duplicate. \n\n        Example: \"aaa\" for L=2: \n          substrings: \n            i=0: \"aa\" -> add to seen.\n            i=1: \"aa\" -> found in seen -> break.\n\n        Example: \"ababa\" for L=3:\n          i=0: \"aba\" -> add\n          i=1: \"bab\" -> add\n          i=2: \"aba\" -> found -> break.\n\n        This gives L=3, which is correct.\n\n        But what if the duplicate occurs not consecutively? \n\n          Example: \"abcabc\" for L=3:\n            i0: \"abc\" -> add\n            i1: \"bca\" -> add\n            i2: \"cab\" -> add\n            i3: \"abc\" -> found -> break.\n\n        This also works.\n\n        However, note: the set method doesn't remember how many times we've seen a substring, but we only need to know if we've seen it at least once. Then when we see it again, we break.\n\n        But wait: what if a substring appears three times, but we break at the second occurrence. That's okay because we only care about at least two.\n\n        However, there is a caveat: what if two different substrings are the same? Then we break at the second occurrence. But that's what we want.\n\n        But note: we are storing the substring as a key. So if two different substrings (by content) are the same, then they are the same substring.\n\n        This method is correct.\n\n        However, there is a potential issue: the set method does not account for the fact that the same substring might appear twice, but we are storing the substring and comparing by value. This is correct.\n\n        But what if we have two different substrings that are equal? Then they are the same substring.\n\n        So the code becomes:\n\n          n = len(s)\n          # Edge: if n==0, but the problem says non-empty, so skip.\n          # Check for the maximum L from n-1 down to 1\n          ans = 0\n          for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n              seen = set()\n              duplicate_found = False\n              for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                  substr = s[i:i+L]\n                  if substr in seen:\n                      duplicate_found = True\n                      break\n                  else:\n                      seen.add(substr)\n              if duplicate_found:\n                  ans = L\n                  break\n\n          print(ans)\n\n        But wait, what if no duplicate is found? Then we output 0.\n\n        Let's test with \"abcd\": \n          n=4, L from 3 down to 1.\n          L=3: \n            i0: \"abc\" -> add\n            i1: \"bcd\" -> add -> no duplicate, so L=3 fails.\n          L=2:\n            i0: \"ab\" -> add\n            i1: \"bc\" -> add\n            i2: \"cd\" -> add -> no duplicate.\n          L=1:\n            i0: \"a\" -> add\n            i1: \"b\" -> add\n            i2: \"c\" -> add\n            i3: \"d\" -> add -> no duplicate.\n\n          Then ans remains 0, which is correct.\n\n        Another test: \"zzz\": \n          n=3, L from 2 down to 1.\n          L=2:\n            i0: \"zz\" -> add\n            i1: \"zz\" -> found in seen -> break, set ans=2.\n\n        Another test: \"ababa\": \n          n=5, L from 4 down to 1.\n          L=4: \n            substrings: \n              \"abab\", \"baba\" -> no duplicate -> move to L=3.\n          L=3:\n            i0: \"aba\" -> add\n            i1: \"bab\" -> add\n            i2: \"aba\" -> found -> break, ans=3.\n\n        But wait, the substring \"aba\" appears at index0 and index2, so that's two occurrences. Correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"occurrences can overlap\". Our method allows overlapping because we are taking contiguous substrings and the same substring can appear in overlapping positions.\n\n        But what if we have a string like \"aabaac\" and we are looking for length 2: \n          substrings: \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aa\", \"ac\"\n          When we are at L=2, we see:\n            i0: \"aa\" -> add\n            i1: \"ab\" -> add\n            i2: \"ba\" -> add\n            i3: \"aa\" -> duplicate -> break.\n\n        So we get 2.\n\n        However, note: the two \"aa\" are at i0 and i3, which are not overlapping (they are separated by one character). But the problem allows overlapping, so that's fine.\n\n        But wait, the problem says \"These occurrences can overlap\", meaning they can, but they don't have to. Our method doesn't require the two occurrences to be adjacent or overlapping, it just checks for any two.\n\n        This solution is O(n^2) in the worst-case (if we don't break early) but in our inner loop we break as soon as we find a duplicate. However, the worst-case for a given L is when there is no duplicate, then we have to check all n-L+1 substrings. And we do this for each L from n-1 down to 1. So the worst-case total operations is still about O(n^2) because the number of substrings is O(n^2). But n<=100, so worst-case 5050 substrings, which is acceptable.\n\n        However, we are doing:\n\n          for L in range(n-1,0,-1):\n              for i in range(0, n-L+1):\n                  substr = s[i:i+L]   # slicing a string of length L, which is O(L) per slice.\n\n          The total cost is: for each L, we do (n-L+1) slices, each of length L, so the total operations is sum_{L=1}^{n-1} (n-L+1)*L.\n\n          Let n=100: \n            Sum_{L=1}^{99} (100-L)*(L) = Sum_{L=1}^{99} (100L - L^2) = 100 * (99*100//2) - (sum_{L=1}^{99} L^2) \n\n          The first term: 100 * (99*100//2) = 100 * 4950 = 495000\n          The second term: 99*100*199//6 = (approx) 99*100*199/6 ~ 328350\n\n          So total operations is about 495000 - 328350 = 166650, which is acceptable for n=100.\n\n        But note: worst-case is when we don't break early, so we do all the slices. However, in the worst-case (no duplicate) we do all the slices.\n\n        Since 166650 is acceptable for modern computers, we can proceed.\n\n        However, we can optimize the slicing by using a rolling hash or something, but n is only 100, so it's acceptable.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the string is non-empty and up to 100. We are doing O(n^3) in the worst-case? Actually, the inner loop for a fixed L does (n-L+1) slices, each slice of length L, so the total is O(n^3). \n\n        For n=100, 100^3 = 1e6, but our calculation above was 166650, which is less than 1e6, so it's acceptable.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute the hash for all substrings to avoid the O(L) per slice. But since n is 100, we can keep it simple.\n\n        Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n        One more edge: what if the string is very short? For example, n=1: then we iterate L from 0 down to 1? Actually, our loop is for L in range(n-1,0,-1). If n=1, then n-1=0, and the range(0,0,-1) doesn't run. Then we output 0.\n\n        Example: \"a\" -> output 0. Correct.\n\n        Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        # If the string is empty, but the problem says non-empty, so skip.\n        # We are going to iterate from L = n-1 down to 1.\n        ans = 0\n        # If n==0, but guaranteed non-empty, so skip.\n\n        # Consider: if n==0, but we are told non-empty, so assume n>=1.\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            found_duplicate = False\n            # Generate all substrings of length L\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    found_duplicate = True\n                    break\n                else:\n                    seen.add(substr)\n            if found_duplicate:\n                ans = L\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n        But wait, the problem says the input is given as the first line. The example input format is given as an array of strings, but actually the problem says:\n\n          The first input line contains the string.\n\n        So we do:\n\n          s = input().strip()\n\n        However, the example input is given as:\n\n          ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input format is one string per line.\n\n        But wait, the example input is shown as an array. Actually, the problem says:\n\n          Input\n          The first input line contains the string.\n\n        So we read one string.\n\n        Let me check the sample tests: \n          Input: \"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\"\n\n        But the example output is: \"0\", \"3\", \"2\"\n\n        However, the example input is given as an array, but the problem says the first input line contains the string.\n\n        So we read one string.\n\n        But wait, the example input format is ambiguous. Actually, the problem says:\n\n          The first input line contains the string.\n\n        So we assume one string per test.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"You're given a string\", meaning one string.\n\n        However, the example input is provided as:\n\n          ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n        This might be just showing the examples. The actual input is one string.\n\n        So the code reads one string.\n\n        But wait, the problem says the input is from stdin. So we read one line.\n\n        Let me run the code with the examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"abcd\" -> output 0\n        Example 2: \"ababa\" -> output 3\n        Example 3: \"zzz\" -> output 2\n\n        It matches.\n\n        However, let me test with another example: \"aab\" (n=3)\n\n          L=2: \n            i0: \"aa\" -> add\n            i1: \"ab\" -> add -> no duplicate, so we go to L=1.\n          L=1:\n            i0: \"a\" -> add\n            i1: \"a\" -> found -> duplicate, so output 1.\n\n        But wait, the expected output for \"aab\" should be 1? Because the substring \"a\" (length 1) appears twice. But is there a longer substring? \n          The substring of length 2: \"aa\" appears once, \"ab\" appears once. So the longest substring that appears at least twice is of length 1.\n\n        However, the problem says \"longest substring\", so 1 is the answer.\n\n        But wait, the example \"zzz\" has length 2 and that's longer than 1. So the code returns 2 for \"zzz\", which is correct.\n\n        But in \"aab\", the substring \"aa\" (length2) only appears once, so we don't consider it. The substring \"a\" (length1) appears twice.\n\n        But note: the substring \"a\" appears at index0 and index1, so two times.\n\n        So the code returns 1 for \"aab\", which is correct.\n\n        However, the example \"aab\" is not provided, but according to our reasoning, the answer is 1.\n\n        But wait, the problem says \"longest substring\", so if there is a substring of length 1 that appears twice, then even if there is a substring of length 2 that appears once, we don't care. We are looking for the longest one that appears at least twice. In \"aab\", the longest substring that appears at least twice is of length 1.\n\n        But wait, what about the substring \"a\" of length 1? It appears twice. And there is no substring of length 2 that appears twice. So the answer is 1.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have \"aabaac\"? We found that the substring \"aa\" (length2) appears twice (at indices0 and 3). Then the answer would be 2.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        But wait, there is a possibility: what if a substring of length L appears twice, and a substring of length L-1 (which is contained in the substring of length L) appears more than twice? But we don't care, because we are iterating from the largest L and we break at the first L that has at least one substring appearing twice.\n\n        Example: \"aaa\" (n=3): \n          L=2: substring \"aa\" appears twice -> so we output 2.\n\n        But note: the substring \"a\" (length1) also appears three times, but 2>1, so we output 2.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can submit the code.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the string is non-empty and consists of lower-case Latin letters.\n\n        Final code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        if n == 0:\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        # We'll iterate from L = n-1 down to 1\n        ans = 0\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            duplicate_found = False\n            for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    duplicate_found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if duplicate_found:\n                ans = L\n                break\n\n        print(ans)\n\n        However, note: the set `seen` is created for each L. We break as soon as we find a duplicate for that L.\n\n        But wait, in the inner loop we break and then we break the outer loop. So we don't check the rest of the L's.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Let me run with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"abcd\" -> 0\n        Example 2: \"ababa\" -> 3\n        Example 3: \"zzz\" -> 2\n\n        Example 4: \"aab\" -> 1\n\n        Example 5: \"aabaac\" -> 2\n\n        Example 6: \"abcde\" -> 0\n\n        Example 7: \"aaaa\" -> \n          n=4, L from 3 down to 1.\n          L=3: \n            substrings: \"aaa\", \"aaa\" -> duplicate at the second substring? \n            i0: \"aaa\" -> add\n            i1: \"aaa\" -> found -> break, output 3.\n\n        But wait, the string \"aaaa\" has two overlapping occurrences of \"aaa\": at index0 and index1. So the answer 3 is correct.\n\n        Example 8: \"abcabc\" -> \n          n=6, L from 5 down to 1.\n          L=5: \n            \"abcab\", \"bcabc\" -> no duplicate.\n          L=4:\n            \"abca\", \"bcab\", \"cabc\" -> no duplicate.\n          L=3:\n            \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", \"abc\" -> duplicate at the last one -> output 3.\n\n        But wait, \"abc\" appears at index0 and index3. So the answer 3 is correct.\n\n        However, note: there is a substring of length 3 that appears twice, but also a substring of length 2 that appears multiple times? \n          \"ab\" appears at index0 and index3? Actually, \"ab\" at index0 and index3: \n            \"abcabc\": \n              \"ab\" at index0: \"ab\"\n              \"ab\" at index3: \"ab\" (from \"abcabc\" -> substring starting at index3: \"abc\", so \"ab\" is not contiguous at index3? Actually, the substring of length2 starting at index3 is \"ca\", then index4 is \"bc\", index5 is \"c\". So no.\n\n          Actually, the substring \"ab\" appears at index0 and index4? \n            index0: \"ab\"\n            index4: \"bc\" -> no, then index1: \"bc\", index2: \"ca\", index3: \"ab\", index4: \"bc\", index5: \"c\" -> wait, no \"ab\" at index3: \n            s[3:5] = \"ab\"\n\n          So \"ab\" appears at index0 and index3. But wait, we are checking for L=2: \n            i0: \"ab\" -> add\n            i1: \"bc\" -> add\n            i2: \"ca\" -> add\n            i3: \"ab\" -> duplicate -> so we break at L=2 and output 2.\n\n          But wait, we are iterating from L=5 down to 1, so we break at the first L (largest) that has a duplicate. \n\n          In \"abcabc\", the largest L for which there's a duplicate is 3? Actually, we found a duplicate at L=3, but then we",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of these substrings can overlap, and the solution should efficiently handle all edge cases.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters within a string that repeats at least once. The key insight is that the solution must check all possible substrings of decreasing lengths from the largest possible (n-1) down to 1. For each length, we examine all substrings of that length to see if any appear more than once.\n2. **Intuition**: By checking larger substrings first, we can quickly determine the longest valid substring without having to process smaller ones unnecessarily. This approach leverages the fact that longer substrings are less likely to repeat, so finding one early allows us to terminate the search early.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm iterates over possible substring lengths from the largest (n-1) down to 1. For each length, it uses a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, the algorithm records the length and breaks out of the loop early for efficiency.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^3) due to nested loops (iterating over substring lengths and then over all starting positions). However, given the constraint that the string length does not exceed 100, this approach is feasible and efficient enough.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nif n == 0:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\nans = 0\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    duplicate_found = False\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            duplicate_found = True\n            break\n        seen.add(substr)\n    if duplicate_found:\n        ans = L\n        break\n\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the string is empty (though the problem guarantees it's non-empty), the code outputs 0 and exits.\n3. **Iterating Over Substring Lengths**: The outer loop starts from the largest possible substring length (n-1) and decrements down to 1.\n4. **Tracking Substrings**: For each length, the inner loop generates all substrings of that length. A set is used to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered more than once, the loop breaks early, and the current length is recorded as the answer.\n5. **Output Result**: Once the loop finds the longest valid substring length, it prints the result. If no such substring is found, it defaults to 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest repeating substring by leveraging early termination upon finding the first valid length, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
