There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m and then m lines of l, r, x.\n Since n, m <= 50, we can use dynamic programming with state compression or try to use constraints.\n\n However, note that the restrictions might overlap. The key is that in each spot i, the height must be at most the minimum of:\n   - h (the overall maximum)\n   - the maximum allowed by any restriction that covers i.\n\n But note: it's not just the minimum of all restrictions covering i, because a restriction says \"the tallest house from [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i\".\n However, if we set a house to a value too high, it might break a restriction even if other restrictions allow higher.\n\n Alternate approach: \n   Step 1: Precompute for each spot i, the maximum height allowed at i (call it A[i]) as follows:\n        A[i] = min( h, min_{for each restriction j that covers i} (x_j) )\n\n But wait: is that sufficient? Consider two restrictions:\n        Restriction 1: [1,3] <= 5\n        Restriction 2: [1,2] <= 3\n        Then for spot 1: both restrictions apply -> min(5,3)=3.\n        For spot 2: both restrictions apply -> min(5,3)=3.\n        For spot 3: only restriction 1 -> 5.\n\n However, note: the restriction [1,3] <=5 does not require that every house is <=5, but the tallest in the entire segment [1,3] must be <=5.\n But if we set the house at spot 3 to 6, then the tallest in [1,3] would be 6 which violates the first restriction. Similarly, the second restriction requires that the tallest in [1,2] is <=3.\n\n However, if we set each house independently to the minimum of h and the restrictions that cover it, then:\n     house1: min(h, 3) = 3\n     house2: min(h, 3) = 3\n     house3: min(h, 5) = 5\n\n But then check the first restriction: the tallest in [1,3] is max(3,3,5)=5 <=5 -> okay.\n The second restriction: the tallest in [1,2] is max(3,3)=3 <=3 -> okay.\n\n However, consider: what if we set house3 to 4? Then the first restriction: max(3,3,4)=4<=5 -> still okay, and the second restriction is still 3<=3. And 4^2 is more than 3^2? Actually, no: 3^2=9, 4^2=16 -> so we want to set house3 as high as possible (to 5) to maximize profit.\n\n But wait: the above assignment (each house set to the minimum allowed by any restriction that covers it) is actually the maximum allowed for that house? Not necessarily: because a restriction doesn't force the house to be the minimum of the restrictions, but the entire segment must have a maximum <= x_i. So for a house i, the maximum we can assign is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover i? Actually, no: consider that if there is a restriction that covers a segment including i, then the entire segment must have maximum <= x_i. Therefore, the house i cannot exceed x_i. Moreover, if multiple restrictions cover i, then the most restrictive one (the smallest x_i) must be respected.\n\n However, is the independent assignment (each house set to the maximum allowed by the restrictions that cover it, which is the minimum x_i among the covering restrictions and h) valid?\n\n Let's test with the example: \n   Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n   Without restrictions, we could set each house to 3. But with restrictions:\n        Spot1: covered by [1,1] -> min(3,1)=1 -> set to 1.\n        Spot2: covered by [2,2] -> min(3,3)=3 -> set to 3.\n        Spot3: covered by [3,3] -> min(3,2)=2 -> set to 2.\n\n   This gives [1,3,2] and profit 1+9+4=14.\n\n   But is this the best we can do? What if we set spot1 to 1 (as required), spot2 to 3 (as allowed) and spot3 to 2 (as required). It fits.\n\n   Now, why not set spot3 to 3? Because the third restriction says it must be <=2. So we cannot.\n\n   However, consider: what if we set spot2 to 2? Then we have [1,2,2]. Profit = 1+4+4=9, which is less.\n\n   So the independent assignment (each house set to the maximum allowed by its own restrictions) is indeed the maximum we can set for that house without violating any restriction that covers it.\n\n   BUT: There is a catch: sometimes, the restrictions might interact. For example, consider:\n\n        n=2, h=10, m=2\n        Restriction1: [1,2] <=5\n        Restriction2: [1,1] <=8\n\n        Then for spot1: min(10,5,8) = 5 -> set to 5.\n        For spot2: min(10,5) = 5 -> set to 5.\n\n        Profit: 5^2 + 5^2 = 50.\n\n        However, if we set spot1 to 8 and spot2 to 5, then:\n            Restriction1: max(8,5)=8 -> which is >5 -> invalid.\n\n        So our independent assignment must be done in a way that respects that the entire segment of a restriction must have max <= x_i.\n\n        The independent assignment (each house set to the minimum of h and the x_i of all restrictions covering it) is necessary, but is it sufficient?\n\n        Actually, if we set each house to the minimum of h and the restrictions, then for any restriction j (covering [l_j, r_j]), the maximum house height in that segment is at most x_j (because each house in the segment is at most x_j). So the condition is satisfied.\n\n        Therefore, we can define:\n            A[i] = min( h, min_{for each restriction j such that l_j<=i<=r_j} (x_j) )\n\n        Then, the problem reduces to: we have an array A[1..n] (each A[i] is the maximum height we can assign to house i). But note: we are allowed to choose a height for house i in the range [0, A[i]] (and we want to maximize the sum of squares).\n\n        However, we must also note: the restrictions might force some houses to be lower, but the above A[i] is the maximum allowed for house i.\n\n        Then the problem becomes: for each spot i, choose a value v_i in [0, A[i]] to maximize the sum of v_i^2.\n\n        And we know that the square function is convex and increasing for nonnegative numbers, so we would set each v_i to A[i] (the maximum allowed) to maximize the profit.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum profit is: sum_{i=1}^{n} (A[i])^2.\n\n        Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n Example 1:\n        n=3, h=3, m=3\n        Restrictions: \n            [1,1] <=1 -> A[1]=min(3,1)=1\n            [2,2] <=3 -> A[2]=min(3,3)=3\n            [3,3] <=2 -> A[3]=min(3,2)=2\n\n        Profit = 1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 1+9+4=14 -> matches.\n\n Example 2:\n        Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n        Compute A for each spot:\n            Spot1: no restriction? Then A[1]=min(10, ...) -> but we must consider all restrictions that cover it.\n            How do we compute A[i]? We need to know which restrictions cover i.\n\n        Steps for Example2:\n            n=4, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [2,3] <=8\n            Restriction2: [3,4] <=7\n\n            Spot1: no restriction -> A[1] = min(10) = 10\n            Spot2: covered by restriction1 -> min(10,8)=8\n            Spot3: covered by restriction1 and restriction2 -> min(10,8,7)=7\n            Spot4: covered by restriction2 -> min(10,7)=7\n\n            Then profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n        This matches the example.\n\n However, wait: what if there are no restrictions? Then we set each house to h, and the profit is n * h^2.\n\n But consider a different example: \n        n=1, h=10, m=0 -> profit = 10^2 = 100.\n\n        Another example: \n            n=1, h=10, m=1, restriction: [1,1] <=5 -> profit = 25.\n\n        So the method is: \n            Step1: Create an array `arr` of length n (0-indexed) with initial value h (or we can use h as the base).\n            Step2: For each restriction (l, r, x): \n                    For each index i from l-1 to r-1 (0-indexed), set arr[i] = min(arr[i], x)\n\n            Then, the answer is the sum of (a_i)^2 for each a_i in arr.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that the overall maximum height is h, and then the restrictions further limit. So we start with h and then take min with the restrictions.\n\n        But wait: what if a restriction has x greater than h? Then we don't need to change because h is already the minimum. However, the input says x_i can be up to h, so x_i>=0 and <=h. So we can safely do min(h, x_i) but our method above uses the initial value h and then takes min with x_i (which is <=h) so it's safe.\n\n        However, note: the restrictions are given with x_i in [0, h]. So we can do:\n\n            Let A = [h] * n   # for each spot, initially we can use up to h\n\n            For each restriction (l, r, x):\n                for i from l-1 to r-1:\n                    if x < A[i]:\n                        A[i] = x\n\n            Then, profit = sum(i=0 to n-1) A[i]^2\n\n        But wait: is that correct? \n\n        Example: \n            n=2, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,2] <=5\n            Restriction2: [1,1] <=8\n\n            Initially: A = [10,10]\n            After restriction1: A = [5,5]\n            After restriction2: A[0] = min(5,8)=5, so A=[5,5]\n\n            Profit = 5^2+5^2=50.\n\n        But what if we set house1 to 8? Then the first restriction says the entire segment [1,2] must have max<=5 -> so house1=8 violates the first restriction.\n\n        Therefore, the above method is correct.\n\n        However, note: the problem does not require that we set each house to the minimum of h and the restrictions? Actually, the restrictions are independent and we must satisfy all. The above method ensures that for each house, we set it to at most the minimum of h and the x_i of all restrictions that cover it.\n\n        Why is that the maximum we can set? Because if we set a house to a value higher than the minimum x_i of its covering restrictions, then that particular restriction (the one with the smallest x_i) would be violated (since the entire segment must have maximum <= x_i, and if one house is too high then the segment's maximum is too high). Also, we are not limited by h (so we don't go above h). \n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n            Read n, h, m.\n            Initialize an array A of length n with h.\n\n            For each of the m restrictions:\n                Read l, r, x.\n                For each index i in [l-1, r-1] (0-indexed):\n                    if x < A[i]:\n                        A[i] = x\n\n            Then, compute the total profit = sum(a*a for a in A)\n\n        Let's run the examples:\n\n        Example1: n=3, h=3, m=3\n            A = [3,3,3]\n            Restriction1: l=1, r=1, x=1 -> update A[0] to min(3,1)=1 -> A=[1,3,3]\n            Restriction2: l=2, r=2, x=3 -> update A[1] to min(3,3)=3 -> A=[1,3,3]\n            Restriction3: l=3, r=3, x=2 -> update A[2] to min(3,2)=2 -> A=[1,3,2]\n\n            Profit = 1+9+4=14.\n\n        Example2: n=4, h=10, m=2\n            A = [10,10,10,10]\n            Restriction1: l=2, r=3, x=8 -> update indices 1 and 2: A[1]=8, A[2]=8 -> [10,8,8,10]\n            Restriction2: l=3, r=4, x=7 -> update indices 2 and 3: \n                A[2]=min(8,7)=7; A[3]=min(10,7)=7 -> [10,8,7,7]\n            Profit = 10^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 7^2 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n        But wait, the example input was: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\", which we processed correctly.\n\n        However, consider an example where the same house is covered by multiple restrictions with different x_i:\n\n            n=1, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,1] <=5\n            Restriction2: [1,1] <=8\n\n            Then: A[0] = min(10,5,8)=5.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But note: the problem says the restrictions are given as (l_i, r_i, x_i). We are updating each house by taking the minimum x_i from all restrictions that cover it. That is correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if the same house is covered by two restrictions with x_i=5 and x_i=10? Then the house is set to 5.\n\n        But note: the square function is increasing, so setting the house to 5 is better than 10? Actually, no: we want the maximum value allowed. But 5 is the maximum allowed (because the restriction with 5 applies). So we must set it to 5.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n            A = [h] * n\n            for _ in range(m):\n                data = input().split()\n                if not data:\n                    continue\n                l = int(data[0])\n                r = int(data[1])\n                x = int(data[2])\n                # update the segment [l-1:r] (0-indexed)\n                for i in range(l-1, r):\n                    if x < A[i]:\n                        A[i] = x\n\n            total = 0\n            for a in A:\n                total += a*a\n            print(total)\n\n        However, wait: what if there are no restrictions? Then we set each house to h, and the profit is n*h^2.\n\n        But note: the problem says the maximum height per house is h, so that is correct.\n\n        But wait: is it always optimal to set each house to the maximum allowed (A[i])? \n\n        Yes, because the profit function is f(v) = v^2, which is strictly increasing and strictly convex for v>=0. Therefore, we want the highest value allowed.\n\n        However, consider: what if a restriction forces a house to be lower, but then the restriction is on a segment and we might set a house lower to allow another house to be higher? \n\n        Let me clarify: the restrictions are independent per house: each house i is constrained by the minimum x_i of the restrictions covering it. And the condition for a restriction j is that the maximum house in [l_j, r_j] is <= x_j. \n\n        The above method sets each house to the maximum value allowed by the individual restrictions. And note: if we set a house to a value lower than the maximum allowed, then we are not using the full potential. And since the square function is increasing, we want the maximum allowed.\n\n        But wait: what if by setting a house lower we can relax a restriction on another house? Actually, the restrictions are defined by the entire segment. For example, consider:\n\n            n=2, h=10, m=1\n            Restriction: [1,2] <= 5\n\n            Then our method sets both houses to 5, so profit = 25+25=50.\n\n            But what if we set house1 to 0 and house2 to 5? Then the maximum in [1,2] is 5, which is allowed. But the profit is 0+25=25, which is worse.\n\n            Or set house1 to 3 and house2 to 5? Then profit=9+25=34, still worse.\n\n        So we cannot get away with lowering a house to allow a neighbor to be higher, because the entire segment must be <= x_i. In fact, the house that is set to the maximum allowed (5) is the best we can do for that house, and the other house is similarly set.\n\n        However, consider a more complex example:\n\n            n=3, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,2] <=5\n            Restriction2: [2,3] <=5\n\n            Our method:\n                A = [10,10,10]\n                After Restriction1: [5,5,10]\n                After Restriction2: [5,5,5] -> profit=3*(5^2)=75.\n\n            Now, what if we set house2 to 10? Then the first restriction: [1,2] has max(max(?,10)) -> but wait, house1 is set to 5 (because of the first restriction) and house2 to 10: then the first restriction: [1,2] has max(5,10)=10, which violates Restriction1.\n\n            So we cannot set house2 to 10.\n\n            But what if we set house2 to 5? Then the second restriction: [2,3] has max(5, house3). If house3 is 5, then ok. But if house3 is 10, then max(5,10)=10, which violates Restriction2.\n\n            So the method is correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if we set house2 to 3 (which is less than 5) and then set house1 to 5 and house3 to 5? Then the first restriction: max(5,3)=5 -> ok; the second restriction: max(3,5)=5 -> ok. Then profit = 25+9+25=59, which is less than 75.\n\n        Therefore, the method is correct because we are allowed to set each house to the maximum allowed by the restrictions that cover it, and that is the best we can do.\n\n        But note: the above method does not consider that a restriction might be satisfied by a combination of houses, not necessarily each house at the maximum. However, the condition for a restriction j is that the maximum in [l_j, r_j] <= x_j. The maximum in [l_j, r_j] is the maximum of the values we set. Therefore, if we set any house in [l_j, r_j] to more than x_j, the restriction fails. And if we set all houses in [l_j, r_j] to <= x_j, then the maximum is <= x_j. So the condition is equivalent to: for each house i in [l_j, r_j], we must set it to <= x_j.\n\n        Therefore, the method is correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have two restrictions that overlap and one is more permissive than the other, but we set one house to the more permissive value and then the other restriction is broken? \n\n        Example: \n            n=2, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n            Restriction2: [1,2] <= 10\n\n            Then by our method, for house1: min(10,5,10)=5; for house2: min(10,5,10)=5 -> profit=50.\n\n            But note: the second restriction is automatically satisfied if the first is (since 5<=10). So the second restriction doesn't add anything.\n\n        But what if we have:\n\n            n=2, h=10, m=2\n            Restriction1: [1,2] <= 5\n            Restriction2: [1,1] <= 10   (only house1)\n\n            Then house1: min(10,5,10)=5; house2: min(10,5)=5 -> same.\n\n        So the algorithm is:\n\n            Read n, h, m.\n            A = [h] * n\n            for each of the m restrictions:\n                l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n                for i in range(l-1, r):\n                    if x < A[i]:\n                        A[i] = x\n\n            Then compute the sum of squares.\n\n        But wait: is it possible that by setting a house to the minimum of the restrictions, we are violating the condition that the entire segment must be <= the restriction's x? \n\n        No, because if we set each house i to at most the minimum x_i (from the restrictions covering i), then for any restriction j (with x_j) covering a house i, we have A[i] <= x_j (since x_j is one of the restrictions covering i, and we set A[i] to the minimum of all x's including x_j). Therefore, the entire segment [l_j, r_j] will have each house <= x_j, so the maximum in the segment is <= x_j.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is complete.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the maximum height is h, so we are bounded by h. And our initial value is h, and then we reduce by the restrictions (which are <= h). So the array A[i] is always between 0 and h.\n\n        Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n        But wait: the input says the restrictions can have x_i=0. Then we set the house to 0. And that is allowed.\n\n        Example: \n            n=1, h=10, m=1, [1,1] <=0 -> profit=0.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        One more thing: the problem says the spots are labeled from 1 to n. Our array is 0-indexed, so we adjust the indices.\n\n        Code:\n\n            import sys\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            if not data:\n                print(0)\n                exit(0)\n\n            # Parse first three integers\n            it = iter(data)\n            n = int(next(it)); h = int(next(it)); m = int(next(it))\n\n            # Initialize the array with h\n            A = [h] * n\n\n            # Process each restriction\n            for i in range(m):\n                l = int(next(it)); r = int(next(it)); x = int(next(it))\n                # Update the segment [l-1, r-1] (inclusive) in the array A\n                for idx in range(l-1, r):\n                    if x < A[idx]:\n                        A[idx] = x\n\n            total = 0\n            for val in A:\n                total += val * val\n\n            print(total)\n\n        Let me run the provided examples.\n\n        Example1: \n            Input: \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n            n=3, h=3, m=3\n            A = [3,3,3]\n            First restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1 -> update index0: A[0]=min(3,1)=1 -> [1,3,3]\n            Second: l=2, r=2, x=3 -> update index1: A[1]=min(3,3)=3 -> [1,3,3]\n            Third: l=3, r=3, x=2 -> update index2: A[2]=min(3,2)=2 -> [1,3,2]\n            Sum = 1+9+4=14.\n\n        Example2: \n            Input: \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n            n=4, h=10, m=2\n            A = [10,10,10,10]\n            First restriction: l=2, r=3, x=8 -> update indices 1 and 2: A[1]=8, A[2]=8 -> [10,8,8,10]\n            Second restriction: l=3, r=4, x=7 -> update indices 2 and 3: \n                A[2]=min(8,7)=7, A[3]=min(10,7)=7 -> [10,8,7,7]\n            Sum = 10*10 + 8*8 + 7*7 + 7*7 = 100+64+49+49 = 262.\n\n        However, wait: the example input was given as two separate lines in the example, but the problem input format is as described.\n\n        But wait: the example input in the problem statement is:\n\n            Input: ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n        This is two separate examples. Our code reads from stdin, so we have to read until EOF.\n\n        The problem says: \n            The first line contains three integers ... and then each of the next m lines ...\n\n        So we are reading the entire input.\n\n        However, the example input is provided as two strings in a list. But in reality, we are reading from stdin.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", meaning we should read from stdin.\n\n        Let me test with the provided example inputs.\n\n        But wait: the example output is ['14','262'].\n\n        However, the example input is given as two separate examples. We are writing a program that reads the entire input until EOF.\n\n        The sample input might be two separate test cases? Actually, the problem states:\n\n            The first line contains three integers n, h, m...\n\n        So the input is one instance. The example shows two examples, but they are separate.\n\n        But the problem says: \"You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\"\n\n        So we are to read one instance.\n\n        The sample input in the example is:\n\n            \"3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2\"\n\n        and \n\n            \"4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7\"\n\n        We are to output:\n\n            14\n            262\n\n        But wait, the problem says \"Print a single integer\".\n\n        So we assume one test case per run.\n\n        But the example input is given as two strings. This is just for illustration.\n\n        Our code reads one test case.\n\n        However, the problem constraints say that m (number of restrictions) is at most 50, and n at most 50. So we are safe.\n\n        But wait: what if there are multiple test cases? The problem statement does not specify.\n\n        Looking back: the input format is described as the first line has n, h, m, then m lines. So one test case.\n\n        Therefore, we output one integer.\n\n        Let me run the code with the sample inputs.\n\n        But note: the example input is given as:\n\n            ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n        This is two test cases. The problem does not say there are multiple test cases.\n\n        However, the problem statement says: \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then gives two examples.\n\n        But the problem constraints say n, h, m >=1 and <=50, and the input format is as described.\n\n        I think the intended meaning is that the input is one test case.\n\n        But the example input is given as two separate strings. This might be because the problem has two examples.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n        However, the problem says \"m\" is the number of restrictions, so we read m restrictions.\n\n        Our code is for one test case.\n\n        If we are to read multiple test cases, we would read until EOF. But the problem does not specify.\n\n        According to the problem statement, we are to read one test case.\n\n        But wait: the example input is two separate examples. How did they test? They must have tested separately.\n\n        Let me check the problem statement again: it says \"The following is a competitive programming problem.\" and then the input format.\n\n        We'll assume one test case per run.\n\n        However, the example input provided in the problem is two separate examples. This might be a copy-paste error.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output: Print a single integer\". So we output one integer.\n\n        Therefore, we'll write the code as above.\n\n        But wait: the problem constraints say n, h, m up to 50, and we are doing a loop over m and then for each restriction we iterate over (r-l+1) houses. In worst-case, r-l+1 can be up to 50 and m up to 50, so total operations 50*50=2500, which is acceptable.\n\n        We are good.\n\n        However, let me consider an alternate scenario: what if we have many overlapping restrictions? The current method updates each house for every restriction that covers it. But we can optimize by first merging the restrictions? \n\n        But note: the restrictions are independent and we are taking the minimum x_i for each house. We don't need to merge. The current method is O(n*m) which is 50*50=2500, acceptable.\n\n        But wait: the input says the restrictions are given arbitrarily. We are updating each house for every restriction that covers it. \n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute for each house the minimum x_i from all restrictions that cover it. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            Create an array B of length n, initialize with a big number (or None) and then for each restriction, update the houses in the segment to the minimum x_i of the restrictions? Actually, we are doing the same as before.\n\n        But note: the above method is straightforward.\n\n        One more edge: what if there is a restriction with x_i larger than h? Then we don't need to update because we start with h and then take min, so it remains h. But the problem says x_i in [0, h], so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n            A = [h] * n\n            for _ in range(m):\n                l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n                for i in range(l-1, r):\n                    if x < A[i]:\n                        A[i] = x\n\n            total = 0\n            for a in A:\n                total += a*a\n            print(total)\n\n        Let me run the sample tests.\n\n        Example1: \n            Input: \n                3 3 3\n                1 1 1\n                2 2 3\n                3 3 2\n\n            Output: 14\n\n        Example2:\n            Input:\n                4 10 2\n                2 3 8\n                3 4 7\n\n            Output: 262\n\n        But wait, the example input is provided as:\n\n            ['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n        In Python, if we read from stdin, we need to read until EOF. \n\n        However, the problem says the input is from stdin. So if we are running the program and pasting the entire input, we need to read until there is no more input.\n\n        But the problem says the first line is n, h, m, so we can read the entire input as:\n\n            import sys\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            if not data:\n                print(0)\n                exit(0)\n\n            n = int(data[0]); h = int(data[1]); m = int(data[2])\n\n            # Then we have m*3 remaining numbers? \n\n        But wait, the input has m lines, each containing three integers. So total numbers is 3 + m*3.\n\n        Alternatively, we can read line by line.\n\n        Since the problem constraints are small, we can read the entire input and then parse.\n\n        But the problem says the input format. Let me change to read line by line.\n\n        Actually, the problem says the first line has three integers, then m lines of three integers.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n            for i in range(m):\n                l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n                # process\n\n        This is simpler.\n\n        However, if the input is given in a file or standard input, we must read until EOF.\n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"The first line contains three integers ... Each of the next m lines ...\"\n\n        So we can read the first line, then m lines.\n\n        But what if the input comes from a pipe and has more than one test case? The problem doesn't say.\n\n        Since the problem statement does not mention multiple test cases, we assume one.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n            A = [h] * n\n            for i in range(m):\n                l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n                for idx in range(l-1, r):\n                    if x < A[idx]:\n                        A[idx] = x\n\n            total = 0\n            for a in A:\n                total += a * a\n\n            print(total)\n\n        But wait: the example input is given as two separate examples. How did the problem author provide two examples? They must have run the program twice.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code as above.\n\n        However, note: the problem constraints say n, h, m can be as low as 1 and as high as 50. Our code handles that.\n\n        Let me test with n=0? The constraints say n>=1.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Final code:\n\n            n, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n            A = [h] * n\n            for _ in range(m):\n                l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n                # Convert to 0-indexed: the segment is from l-1 to r-1 inclusive.\n                for i in range(l-1, r):\n                    if x < A[i]:\n                        A[i] = x\n\n            total = 0\n            for a in A:\n                total += a * a\n\n            print(total)\n\n        But wait: the example input in the problem statement is given as two separate examples. When we run the program, we must provide one test case.\n\n        We are ready to submit.\n\n        However, wait: I just thought of an issue. The problem says the maximum height in a house is h, and the restrictions say the tallest house in a segment must be at most x_i. But note: the restriction x_i might be greater than h? \n\n        The problem says: \"0 <= x_i <= h\", so x_i is at most h. So we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n        Let me run the provided",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to given zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The key challenge is ensuring that all zoning restrictions are satisfied, which imposes constraints on the maximum height of houses in certain segments of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the optimal heights for houses on each spot such that all zoning restrictions are met. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a particular segment must not exceed a given height. The goal is to maximize the sum of the squares of these heights.\n2. **Insight**: The optimal height for each house is the minimum value between the overall maximum height allowed (h) and the most restrictive height specified by any zoning restriction covering that house. This is because violating any restriction would require the house's height to be within the bounds set by all relevant restrictions.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: For each house, we determine its maximum allowable height by considering all zoning restrictions that include it. The maximum height for a house is the smallest value among h and all x_i values from restrictions covering that house. Once we have these maximum heights, the profit is maximized by setting each house's height to this maximum value, as the square function is strictly increasing for non-negative values.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each restriction once, updating the maximum allowable height for each house in the affected segment. With n houses and m restrictions, each involving up to n updates, the total operations are O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 50).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    h = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    \n    A = [h] * n\n    \n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n        r = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n        x = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n        for i in range(l-1, r):\n            if x < A[i]:\n                A[i] = x\n                \n    total = 0\n    for a in A:\n        total += a * a\n        \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints. The first three values are n (number of spots), h (maximum height per house), and m (number of restrictions).\n2. **Initialization**: An array `A` is initialized with the value h for each house, representing the initial maximum allowable height without any restrictions.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the code updates the maximum allowable height for each house in the specified segment. If the restriction's height (x) is less than the current value in `A`, the value is updated to x.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is calculated by summing the squares of the values in `A`. This sum is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the properties of the square function and straightforward array manipulation.",
