Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers: n and a (with 3<=n<=10^5, 1<=a<=180)\n We have a regular convex n-gon. The vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n We need to find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 (with v1 and v3 on its sides) is as close as possible to 'a'.\n\n In a regular convex polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is (360/n) degrees.\n\n How do we represent an angle formed by three vertices?\n Consider: the entire circle is 360 degrees. The angle we form at vertex v2 can be thought of as being formed by two edges: from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require the polygon's internal angle but an arbitrary angle with vertex at one of the polygon's vertices and the two other points being vertices of the polygon.\n\n Actually, the problem says: the value |angle - a| should be minimized.\n\n But note: the example input \"4 67\" -> output \"2 1 3\", which forms a 45-degree angle (since the square has two types of triangles: one with 90 and one with 45). \n\n Observation:\n In a regular polygon, the angle we can form at a vertex v2 must be an angle that is a multiple of the central angle? Actually, the angle at vertex v2 (for three vertices) is determined by the number of sides between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3.\n\n However, note that the angle we form is actually an inscribed angle? Or is it just the angle of the triangle? \n\n Let me think geometrically:\n\n We have a regular n-gon. The angle we form at v2 is the angle between two chords: from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3.\n\n The central angles corresponding to arcs from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 will determine the angle at v2.\n\n Actually, there are two cases: \n  1. The angle we form is the smaller one (the one inside the polygon) or the larger one? But note: the polygon is convex, and we are allowed to choose any three distinct vertices. However, the problem says \"the sides\" meaning the two rays from v2 going through v1 and v3. In the convex polygon, the angle we consider is the one that lies inside the polygon? Or the one that is formed by the two chords? \n\n But note: the example output for the square (n=4) with a=67: they chose an angle of 45 degrees. Also for a=68 they chose 90.\n\n However, note that the problem says: the angle is defined by the two sides (so the two rays from v2). In the plane, the angle at v2 can be measured in two ways: the smaller one (acute or obtuse) and the reflex (which is 360 minus that). But the problem likely considers the smaller one? Because the example: 45 and 90 are both less than 180.\n\n But note: the problem states: \"the value (angle - a)\" and we take absolute difference. So if we have an angle of 315, then |315-67| is 248, which is worse than 45 (which gives |45-67|=22). So we only consider the smaller angle (between 0 and 180) because the other side would be 360 - that angle, and that would be even larger.\n\n Actually, the problem says: the angle is formed by the two sides. In a convex polygon, the angle at vertex v2 for three vertices v1, v2, v3 must be the one that is facing the interior? But note: the example output for the square: \"2 1 3\" and \"4 1 2\" are provided.\n\n However, the problem does not specify whether the angle is measured inside or outside. But note: the polygon is convex, and the three points are chosen arbitrarily (distinct). The angle at v2 is the one that is formed by the two vectors (v2->v1 and v2->v3). There are two angles: the one <=180 and the one >=180. Since the problem says \"as close as possible\", we are allowed to consider both? But wait: the example input \"4 67\" and \"4 68\" show two different choices (one 45 and one 90). \n\n Actually, note that 45 and 90 are the two possibilities for a square? But also note: the entire set of angles we can",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at the vertex (v2) by the other two vertices (v1 and v3) is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. The solution involves leveraging geometric properties of regular polygons to efficiently determine the optimal vertices without resorting to brute-force methods.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Angle in Regular Polygon**: In a regular convex n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. The angle formed at any vertex (v2) by two other vertices (v1 and v3) can be derived from the number of steps between them. Specifically, if there are 'k' steps from v2 to v1 and 'm' steps from v2 to v3, the angle at v2 is calculated based on these steps.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: The angle at v2 can be computed using the formula involving the central angles corresponding to the arcs between v2 and v1, and v2 and v3. The key insight is that the angle depends on the minimum steps between the vertices, considering both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions.\n3. **Binary Search for Optimal Angle**: Given the complexity of checking all possible triplets (which is O(n^3)), we use binary search to efficiently find the triplet that minimizes the absolute difference between the formed angle and the target angle 'a'. The binary search operates on the possible step counts (k and m) around the vertex v2.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n\n    total_angle = 360.0 / n\n\n    def get_angle(k, m):\n        if k == m:\n            return 0.0\n        angle_val = min(abs(k - m) * total_angle, 360.0 - abs(k - m) * total_angle)\n        if angle_val > 180.0:\n            angle_val = 360.0 - angle_val\n        return angle_val\n\n    k_low = 1\n    k_high = n // 2 + 1\n\n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_angle = None\n    best_v1 = None\n    best_v2 = None\n    best_v3 = None\n\n    for start in range(n):\n        v2 = start + 1\n        k_low_bound = 1\n        k_high_bound = n // 2 + 1\n        \n        low_ptr = 1\n        high_ptr = n // 2 + 1\n        mid = (low_ptr + high_ptr) // 2\n        \n        found = False\n        while low_ptr <= high_ptr:\n            mid = (low_ptr + high_ptr) // 2\n            angle_mid = get_angle(mid, n - mid)\n            diff_mid = abs(angle_mid - a)\n            \n            if diff_mid < best_diff:\n                best_diff = diff_mid\n                best_angle = angle_mid\n                best_v1 = (start - mid + n) % n + 1\n                best_v2 = v2\n                best_v3 = (start + mid + 1) % n + 1\n                found = True\n            \n            angle_mid_alt = get_angle(n - mid, mid)\n            diff_mid_alt = abs(angle_mid_alt - a)\n            if diff_mid_alt < best_diff:\n                best_diff = diff_mid_alt\n                best_angle = angle_mid_alt\n                best_v1 = (start - mid + n) % n + 1\n                best_v2 = v2\n                best_v3 = (start + mid + 1) % n + 1\n                found = True\n\n            if diff_mid < best_diff:\n                high_ptr = mid - 1\n            else:\n                low_ptr = mid + 1\n\n    print(f\"{best_v1} {best_v2} {best_v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, 'n' (number of vertices) and 'a' (target angle).\n2. **Central Angle Calculation**: The central angle between two adjacent vertices is computed as 360/n degrees.\n3. **Angle Function**: The function `get_angle` calculates the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices based on the number of steps (k and m) between them. It considers both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions to ensure the minimal angle is used.\n4. **Binary Search**: For each vertex (v2), the algorithm performs a binary search on possible step counts (k) to find the optimal combination (k, m) that minimizes the absolute difference between the formed angle and the target angle 'a'.\n5. **Output**: The vertices (v1, v2, v3) that form the angle closest to 'a' are printed.
