            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles as a string in one line. Each tile is two characters: a digit and a letter (m, p, or s).\n We need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that we have at least one mentsu (which is either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check if we already have a mentsu in the hand (0 draws).\n    - Koutsu: three identical tiles (same digit and same suit). Note: [9m, 1m, 2m] is not a koutsu, but [9m,9m,9m] is.\n    - Shuntsu: three consecutive numbers (differing by 1) in the same suit. The numbers must be in increasing order? But note: [5s,7s,6s] is valid because it's the same as [5s,6s,7s]. So we can sort the numbers.\n\n However, note that the hand has only three tiles. So possibilities:\n   Case 0: Already a mentsu -> 0 draws.\n\n 2. If not, then consider drawing 1 tile. Then we would have four tiles. In four tiles, we can form a mentsu by having:\n   - A triplet (koutsu): we need three of the same. With four tiles, if we have four of a kind, we can form two triplets? Actually, we only need one mentsu. But note: the problem says \"at least one mentsu\", so one triplet is enough.\n\n   Alternatively, we might form a sequence (shuntsu) with three consecutive numbers. But note: the hand might not be three tiles after drawing, but we can use the existing ones and one drawn.\n\n However, note: the problem allows drawing any number of tiles (minimum required). We are to find the minimum.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Possibilities for 0 draws:\n   - Already a triplet: three identical tiles (same digit and same suit)\n   - Already a sequence: three tiles of same suit and consecutive numbers (ignoring order)\n\n For 1 draw:\n   - We can complete a triplet: if we have two of the same tile (same suit and same number), then we can draw one more to make triplet.\n   - We can complete a sequence: if we have two tiles that are consecutive in the same suit, then we can draw the missing one to complete a sequence. Also, if we have one tile and the next two in the sequence are available (but we can draw any tile, so we don't care about availability) then we can complete a sequence? Actually, we can draw the exact tile we need.\n\n But note: the hand may have up to three tiles initially, and then we can add one. We are allowed to draw any tile arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: we are only concerned with the minimum number of draws.\n\n Steps:\n\n Option 0: Check if already mentsu (0 draws).\n\n Option 1: Check if by drawing one tile we can form a mentsu.\n\n How?\n\n For a triplet with one draw:\n   We need two of the same tile. Then drawing one more gives three.\n\n For a sequence with one draw:\n   We need two tiles that can form a consecutive set with one more. There are two cases:\n\n   Case 1: We have two tiles that are consecutive (same suit, and two numbers that are consecutive) and then we need the third. But wait, we have three tiles. We can have:\n\n      Example: ['1m', '2m', '3m'] -> already a sequence (so 0 draws). \n\n   Now, what if we have two tiles that are part of a sequence? \n\n   Example: ['1m', '2m', '4m'] \n     We have two consecutive: [1m,2m] and then we can draw 3m to complete the sequence [1m,2m,3m].\n\n   Example: ['1m','3m','4m'] \n     We have two consecutive: [3m,4m] and we can draw 2m to complete [2m,3m,4m] OR we can draw 5m to complete [3m,4m,5m]? But wait, we have three tiles. The entire hand must form a mentsu. However, note that we are allowed to ignore the other tiles? Actually, the definition is that we must have at least one mentsu. We don't require the entire hand to be a mentsu.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"in her hand\". The hand after drawing will be four tiles. We only need one mentsu. So we can form a mentsu from three of the four tiles.\n\n   Therefore, we can look for:\n\n   Triplet possibility with one draw: \n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: If all three tiles are identical (same digit and suit), then no draws are needed.\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: If the three tiles are of the same suit and their numbers form a consecutive sequence (like 1m, 2m, 3m), then no draws are needed.\n\n2. **Check for One Draw**:\n   - **Triplet Completion**: If there are two identical tiles in the hand, drawing one more of the same tile will complete a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Completion**: If there are two tiles that can form part of a sequence (either consecutive or missing one number in between), drawing the missing tile will complete a sequence. This includes cases where two tiles are consecutive and the third is missing, or two tiles have a gap of one number (e.g., [1m, 3m] can be completed with [2m]).\n\n3. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, Tokitsukaze needs to draw two tiles to either complete a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    if len(data) != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    tiles = [tuple(tile) for tile in data]\n    \n    # Check for 0 draws: koutsu or shuntsu\n    suits = set(suit for _, suit in tiles)\n    digits = [int(dig) for dig, _ in tiles]\n    unique_tiles = set(tiles)\n\n    if len(unique_tiles) == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n        \n    if len(suits) == 1:\n        sorted_digits = sorted(digits)\n        if sorted_digits[1] == sorted_digits[0] + 1 and sorted_digits[2] == sorted_digits[0] + 2:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # Check for 1 draw\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count_by_tile = defaultdict(int)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        count_by_tile[tile] += 1\n\n    # Check for koutsu: if any tile appears twice\n    for tile, count in count_by_tile.items():\n        if count >= 2:\n            # We can draw one more of that tile to make three\n            print(1)\n            return\n\n    # Check for shuntsu: same suit and consecutive numbers\n    suits_count = defaultdict(list)\n    for dig, suit in tiles:\n        suits_count[suit].append(int(dig))\n\n    for suit, digs in suits_count.items():\n        if len(digs) < 2:\n            continue\n        digs.sort()\n        for i in range(len(digs)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(digs)):\n                a = digs[i]\n                b = digs[j]\n                diff = b - a\n                if diff == 1:\n                    print(1)\n                    return\n                elif diff == 2:\n                    print(1)\n                    return\n\n    # Check for other one-draw possibilities: having two tiles that can form a sequence with a drawn tile\n    # But note: we already checked for two consecutive or two with gap 2?

If so, it immediately returns 0.\n2. **Triplet Check**: If there are two identical tiles, drawing one more completes a triplet, so the answer is 1.\n3. **Sequence Check**: The code checks for two tiles that can form part of a sequence (either consecutive or with a single gap).
