For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given n, k, f (with n from 1 to 15, and k, f up to 200000)\n\n The problem asks: \n   We have to assign to every binary string s of length from 1 to n an integer c_s in [0, k].\n   Then, a multiset of binary strings of length exactly n is beautiful if for every string t (of length from 1 to n) the number of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix is at most c_t.\n\n   What we need to compute: the number of ways to assign the integers {c_s} for all binary strings s (each s has a length from 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\n Observation:\n\n Let T be the set of all binary strings of length exactly n. However, note that the condition applies to every string s of length from 1 to n. But note: the multiset contains only strings of length exactly n.\n\n How does the condition work?\n   For a string s of length L (1<=L<=n), the condition says: the number of strings in the multiset (which are of length n) that start with s must be <= c_s.\n\n   Note: A string of length n has exactly one prefix of length L (if we consider the first L characters). So, the condition for a string s (prefix) of length L is that the total count of strings in the multiset that start with s must be <= c_s.\n\n   Now, what is the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset?\n\n   Consider: the multiset is built by including strings of length n. Each string of length n has n prefixes (the prefixes of different lengths). The entire multiset must satisfy for every s (from length 1 to n) the condition.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of building the multiset by considering the constraints imposed by the c_s's.\n\n   In fact, the entire multiset is constrained by the c_s's. The maximum size is determined by the minimal \"constraints\" along the prefixes.\n\n   However, note that the same string of length n has multiple prefixes. The condition must hold for every prefix. Therefore, the entire multiset must satisfy:\n\n     For each string s (of any length L from 1 to n-1): the number of strings in the multiset that start with s is at most c_s.\n\n   And for the full strings (length n): the condition is automatically that the string itself must appear at most c_{s} times? Actually, note: for the full string s (which is of length n), the condition is that the count of s in the multiset is at most c_s. But note: the multiset is built from strings of length n, so the condition for the full string s is independent from the other conditions? Actually, the condition for the full string s is the same as the condition for the prefix s (if we consider s as a string of length n). \n\n   But note: the condition is defined for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So the condition for the full string s (which is a string of length n) is included.\n\n   How to maximize the multiset?\n\n   We can view the problem as: we have a rooted binary tree of depth n (each node represents a string, and we are only concerned with the complete tree of depth n). Each node (string) of length L (so at depth L) has a constraint c_s. The multiset is built by taking leaves (the nodes of depth n) and counting how many times we include each leaf.\n\n   However, note: the condition at a node (prefix) s (of length L) is that the total number of leaves (strings of length n) that pass through s (i.e., have s as prefix) is <= c_s.\n\n   This is a standard problem in a binary trie. The maximum multiset is limited by the constraints at the internal nodes.\n\n   We can also note that the entire multiset is built by including some leaves. The condition for a node s (at depth L) is that the sum of the counts of the leaves in the subtree of s is <= c_s.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum multiset is the maximum total number of leaves we can choose without violating the constraints at any node.\n\n   We can use dynamic programming or combinatorial reasoning on the tree.\n\n   However, note that the problem does not ask for the maximum multiset size for a fixed assignment of c_s, but rather we are assigning the c_s's (for all binary strings s of length from 1 to n) and then the maximum multiset size is determined by the c_s's. We want the assignment such that the maximum multiset size is exactly f.\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   Let M be the maximum multiset size. Then, M is the minimum over all nodes s (prefixes) of the value c_s, but wait: no, because the constraint at a node s is the total number of leaves in its subtree. However, note that the entire multiset is built by leaves, and each leaf is constrained by all the prefixes it contains.\n\n   Actually, the maximum multiset size is the minimum over all nodes s of the value c_s? Not exactly. Consider:\n\n     We can assign arbitrarily high c_s for the root, but if we have a constraint at a deeper node, then the entire subtree of that node is bounded by the smallest c_s encountered along the path from the root to that node? Actually, no: the constraints are additive in the sense that the same leaf is counted in every prefix.\n\n   However, note: the constraint for a node s is the total number of copies of leaves in the subtree of s. Therefore, the maximum multiset is bounded by the minimum capacity that appears in the constraints of the nodes along the path of a leaf? Actually, the entire multiset is constrained by the minimal c_s in the entire tree? No, because the same leaf is counted in every prefix. But note: the constraint for the root is the total number of leaves, and the constraint for a child node is the number of leaves in that branch.\n\n   Actually, the maximum multiset size is the minimum value of the capacities (c_s) that would limit the entire tree? Not exactly: consider two children of the root. The root constraint is the total, and the constraints of the two children are the numbers in their subtrees. Then the total is the sum of the two. But note: the root constraint might be lower than the sum of the two children constraints.\n\n   Therefore, the maximum multiset size is the minimum value among the root constraint and the constraints of the children? Actually, no: the root constraint is the total, and the children constraints are the numbers for the two halves. The maximum multiset is the root constraint (if we split the multiset arbitrarily between the two children, the root constraint must be at least the total). However, the children constraints must be at least the number of copies of leaves in their respective subtrees.\n\n   This problem is analogous to the problem of \"building a binary trie and assigning capacities to each node, then the maximum flow from the root to the leaves is the minimum value of the capacities along the critical paths?\" But note: we are allowed to assign the capacities arbitrarily (from 0 to k) for each node (each binary string).\n\n   However, note: the maximum multiset size is the maximum total number of leaves we can have such that for each node s, the total copies of leaves in the subtree of s is <= c_s.\n\n   How to compute the maximum multiset size for a given assignment of c_s? \n\n   We can use the following: the entire multiset is built by the leaves. Each leaf is contained in the paths from the root to the leaf. The constraint at a node s is the sum of the copies of the leaves in the subtree of s.\n\n   But note: the same leaf is counted in every prefix. Therefore, the constraint for the root (which is the string of length 1? Actually, the root is the empty string? Wait, our strings are of length from 1 to n. The problem says: for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So the root (empty string) is not considered. Then the root node (if we consider the first character) is actually two nodes: '0' and '1'. \n\n   Actually, we have to consider the entire set of prefixes. The root is represented by the empty string? But the problem says \"binary strings s of length from 1 to n\", so we don't have the empty string.\n\n   However, we can build a tree where the root has two children (for '0' and '1'), and then each node has two children (unless we are at depth n). The condition for the root (first character) is that the total copies of leaves that start with '0' plus the copies that start with '1' must be <= c_0 and <= c_1? Actually, no: the condition for the root (the string \"0\") is the total copies of leaves that start with \"0\", and similarly for \"1\". But note: the root (if we consider the whole tree) is not a node in our condition set. Our condition set includes:\n\n      s = \"0\", \"1\", \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\", ... etc.\n\n   So the condition for the root (the entire set of leaves) is not directly given by a single constraint. Instead, we have constraints at every node.\n\n   But note: the multiset is built from leaves (all of length n). The condition for a node s (say \"0\") is the total number of leaves (in the multiset) that have \"0\" as prefix. Similarly for \"00\", etc.\n\n   The maximum multiset size is the maximum total leaves we can have such that for every node s, the total leaves in the subtree of s (i.e., the leaves that have s as prefix) is <= c_s.\n\n   This is a standard problem: the maximum multiset is the minimum value of the capacities (c_s) that appear in the constraints when we traverse the tree? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n   We can assign the same leaf to multiple copies. The constraint for a node s is the total copies of leaves in the subtree of s.\n\n   The maximum multiset size is the minimum over all nodes s of c_s? No, because the root constraint (the entire set of leaves) is the sum of the two children constraints? Actually, the root constraint (if we had one) would be the entire set, but we don't have the root constraint. We have the constraints for the first level, which are the two halves.\n\n   However, note: the entire set of leaves is constrained by the root's children? Actually, the entire set of leaves is the union of the two subtrees. The condition for the root (if we were to consider the entire set as a prefix) is not given, but note: the problem considers only prefixes of length 1 to n. The entire set of leaves is not constrained by a single constraint. Instead, the entire set of leaves is broken down by the first character, and then the second, etc.\n\n   We can use a greedy allocation: \n\n     Let F(s) be the maximum number of copies we can put in the subtree of s (the leaves that have s as prefix) given the constraint c_s and the constraints of the children.\n\n     Then, we have:\n        F(s) = min( c_s, sum_{child t of s} F(t) )\n\n   But wait: the constraint for s is c_s, and the copies of leaves in the subtree of s is the sum of the copies in the two children. So the maximum copies we can put in the entire subtree of s is at most c_s, and also the copies in the two children must be allocated so that the total is at most c_s.\n\n   However, note: the same leaf is counted in every prefix. But the above recurrence is standard for this kind of problem (like the \"capacity\" in a tree). \n\n   Then, the maximum multiset size (the total number of leaves) is F(root) (where the root is the empty string? But our condition set does not include the empty string). Actually, our condition set starts from the first character. So the root of the tree we consider is the set of two nodes: \"0\" and \"1\".\n\n   But note: the problem does not require the empty string to be considered. Therefore, we have two root nodes: \"0\" and \"1\". The entire multiset is the union of the two subtrees.\n\n   However, the condition for the root (the two-level nodes) are independent: the total copies of leaves in the \"0\" subtree must be <= c_0, and similarly for \"1\". There is no constraint for the entire set (since the entire set is the multiset, and the condition for the entire set is not defined because the entire set is the multiset itself, but note: the entire set is not a prefix of length 1..n? Actually, the entire set is not constrained by a single constraint. The constraints are per prefix.\n\n   Actually, the entire multiset is constrained by the constraints at every prefix. But note: the entire multiset is the multiset of leaves. The condition for the entire set (if we were to consider the entire set as a prefix) is not required because the entire set is of length n (if we consider the entire leaf) but the condition applies to every prefix (so the entire leaf is a prefix of itself, which is the condition for the leaf's own string). \n\n   However, the condition for the entire multiset (as a set of leaves) is not explicitly bounded by one constraint. The root constraints (for the two halves) are the immediate ones.\n\n   But note: the entire multiset is the multiset of leaves, and each leaf is constrained by its own c_s (the leaf's string) and by all its ancestors. The maximum multiset is then the minimum between the constraints of the nodes that are on the critical path? Actually, we can use the recurrence:\n\n        Let G(s) be the maximum copies we can put in the subtree rooted at s (which is the set of leaves that have s as prefix) given the constraints for s and its descendants.\n\n        Then, G(s) = min( c_s, sum_{t in children of s} G(t) )\n\n   However, note: the constraint for s is c_s, and the copies in the subtree of s is the sum of the copies in the two subtrees. But also, the constraint for the parent of s will use G(s) (if we were to extend the parent). Since we are only concerned with the entire multiset (the root is the empty string, but we don't have that constraint), we must consider the entire tree.\n\n   But wait, the problem does not assign a constraint for the empty string. The constraints are assigned for every binary string s of length from 1 to n.\n\n   Therefore, we can model the entire multiset as:\n\n        Total = G(0) + G(1)\n\n   where G(0) is computed from the subtree of \"0\", and similarly for \"1\".\n\n   Then, the maximum multiset size is G(0) + G(1) (if we consider the entire tree with root having two children \"0\" and \"1\"). \n\n   However, note: the condition for the root (the first character) is that the entire multiset is broken into two parts: the part starting with '0' (G(0)) and the part starting with '1' (G(1)), and the condition for \"0\" is G(0) <= c_0, and for \"1\" is G(1) <= c_1. But wait, the recurrence for G(0) is:\n\n        G(0) = min( c_0, G(00) + G(01) )\n\n   and similarly for G(1). Then the total multiset size is min(c_0, G(00)+G(01)) + min(c_1, G(10)+G(11)).\n\n   However, note: the constraint for \"00\" is c_{00} and the copies in the subtree of \"00\" is G(00). Similarly for \"01\", \"10\", \"11\".\n\n   Now, we are free to assign the c_s for every string s of length from 1 to n (each s is a binary string of length from 1 to n). The assignment must be in the range [0, k].\n\n   We are to count the number of assignments (for all 2^1+2^2+...+2^n = 2^(n+1)-2 nodes) such that the maximum multiset size (the total) is exactly f.\n\n   How do we count the assignments? \n\n   We have a tree with depth n (each node has two children, unless we are at depth n). The total number of nodes is 2^(n+1)-2.\n\n   We need to assign to each node s a value c_s in [0, k]. Then, the maximum multiset size is:\n\n        T = min(c_0, min(c_00, c_01, ...) )? No, we must compute the entire tree with the recurrence.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the entire multiset size is independent of the assignment of the inner nodes? Actually, the recurrence is:\n\n        Let F(s) = min( c_s, F(left_child(s)) + F(right_child(s)) )   [if s is not a leaf]\n\n   But wait, the leaves (nodes of length n) have no children. Then for a leaf s (of length n), we define F(s) = min(c_s, 0) ? Actually, the leaf's constraint is that the number of copies of itself is at most c_s, but note: the leaf itself is the entire string and the condition for the leaf is that the count of the leaf (if we put x copies of the leaf) must be <= c_s. However, the recurrence for the leaf's parent would be:\n\n        Parent of leaf s: F(parent) = min(c_parent, F(leaf_left) + F(leaf_right))\n\n   But the leaf's F(leaf) is the maximum copies we can put in the subtree of the leaf. Since the leaf is the entire string, the copies of the leaf are independent? Actually, the leaf's subtree only contains itself. So the maximum copies for the leaf is c_s (because the constraint for the leaf is c_s, and there's no further breakdown). However, wait: the condition for the leaf is that the count of the leaf in the multiset is at most c_s. But the leaf is a string of length n, and the condition for the leaf is exactly the count of the leaf. However, the parent node (the prefix of the leaf) is the leaf without the last bit, and the parent's constraint is the total copies of the two leaves (if the parent has two leaves). \n\n   Actually, the recurrence for a node s (non-leaf) is:\n\n        F(s) = min( c_s, F(s0) + F(s1) )\n\n   For a leaf s (string of length n), we have:\n\n        F(s) = min( c_s, 0 )? But wait, the leaf has no children. However, the definition of the multiset is that we can put at most c_s copies of the leaf. But note: the leaf's copies are counted at the leaf's constraint, and also at every prefix. However, the recurrence for the parent uses the total copies of the two leaves (if any) in the subtree.\n\n   Actually, the recurrence for the leaf should be: the maximum copies we can put in the leaf's subtree (which is the leaf itself) is c_s, because the constraint for the leaf is c_s. But note: the parent's constraint is the total copies of the two leaves (if we consider the parent). However, the leaf's constraint is independent of the parent's allocation: the parent's allocation must be at least the total copies of both leaves. But the leaf's own constraint is that the copies of the leaf cannot exceed c_s.\n\n   Therefore, we can define:\n\n        For a leaf s (length n): F(s) = c_s   ??? \n\n   But wait: the condition for the leaf s is that the copies of s in the multiset is <= c_s. However, the copies of s is the same as the copies in the leaf's subtree. Therefore, the maximum copies we can put in the leaf's subtree is c_s.\n\n   However, then the parent's constraint is that the total copies in the two leaves (if we are at the parent) must be <= c_{parent}. Then the parent's F(parent) = min(c_{parent}, F(left_leaf) + F(right_leaf)) = min(c_{parent}, c_{left_leaf} + c_{right_leaf})? \n\n   But note: the parent's constraint is the total copies of the two leaves (if we break down the parent's subtree). However, the leaf's constraint is independent: the left leaf can have up to c_{left_leaf} copies, and the right leaf up to c_{right_leaf}. Then the parent's constraint must be at least the sum of the two leaves' maximums? Not necessarily: the parent's constraint might be lower than the sum.\n\n   Actually, the recurrence is:\n\n        For a non-leaf node s: \n            F(s) = min( c_s, F(s0) + F(s1) )\n\n        For a leaf node s (length n):\n            F(s) = c_s   [but wait, the leaf's constraint is c_s, so we cannot exceed c_s, so the maximum copies we can put in the leaf's subtree is c_s]\n\n   However, then the parent of the leaf (a node of length n-1) would have:\n\n        F(parent) = min( c_parent, F(leaf0) + F(leaf1) ) = min( c_parent, c_{leaf0} + c_{leaf1} )\n\n   But note: the leaf0 and leaf1 are the two children (if the parent is of length n-1, then the leaves are of length n). \n\n   Therefore, the maximum multiset size is the sum of the two leaves? Actually, the entire multiset is the set of leaves (each leaf is a string of length n). The total multiset size is the sum of the copies of each leaf. However, the condition for the parent (the node of length n-1) is that the total copies of the two leaves (the two children) is <= c_{parent}. \n\n   But note: the entire multiset is the union of all the leaves. The total multiset size is the sum of the copies of each leaf. However, the condition for the parent (node of length n-1) is the total copies of the two leaves (which is the entire multiset if the parent is the root? Actually, no: the root is the first character, and the entire multiset is the two halves. Then the root constraint is the total multiset size. \n\n   Actually, the entire multiset is the set of leaves (all of length n). The condition for the root (the two nodes \"0\" and \"1\") is:\n\n        The total copies of leaves starting with '0' is <= c_0, and the total copies of leaves starting with '1' is <= c_1.\n\n        Then the entire multiset size is the sum of the two halves.\n\n   However, note: the root constraint (if we had a constraint for the entire set, i.e., the empty string) would be the entire multiset. But we don't have that. \n\n   Therefore, the maximum multiset size is:\n\n        T = min(c_0, F(00) + F(01)) + min(c_1, F(10) + F(11))\n\n   But wait, the root does not have a direct constraint? Actually, the condition for the root (the two-level nodes) are independent. The entire multiset is broken into two disjoint sets: those starting with '0' and those starting with '1'. Then the condition for the root's children is:\n\n        Condition for \"0\": the total copies of leaves starting with \"0\" (which is the entire subtree under \"0\") must be <= c_0.\n        Similarly for \"1\": the total copies of leaves starting with \"1\" must be <= c_1.\n\n   Then, the maximum multiset size is the minimum between c_0 and the total of the subtree under \"0\", plus the minimum between c_1 and the total of the subtree under \"1\".\n\n   However, the subtree under \"0\" is broken down recursively.\n\n   But note: the entire multiset is the union of the two sets. The condition for the root (if we consider the entire set) is not explicitly stated, but the two conditions (for \"0\" and \"1\") are independent and together they give the entire multiset.\n\n   Therefore, we can define:\n\n        Let dp[s] = the maximum copies we can put in the subtree of node s (given the constraints for s and its descendants, and the assignments for the constraints of s and its descendants).\n\n        Then, for a node s (which is a string) of length L < n:\n            dp[s] = min( c_s, dp[s+'0'] + dp[s+'1'] )\n\n        For a node s of length n (leaf):\n            dp[s] = c_s\n\n        Then, the entire multiset size is dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"]? \n\n        But wait: the entire multiset is the set of leaves (each leaf is a string of length n). The condition for the root (the two-level nodes) is:\n\n            The entire multiset is the set of leaves. The condition for the root's children (the two nodes \"0\" and \"1\") is:\n\n                dp[\"0\"] = min(c_0, dp[\"00\"]+dp[\"01\"])   [if n>=2]\n                dp[\"1\"] = min(c_1, dp[\"10\"]+dp[\"11\"])\n\n            Then, the entire multiset is the set of leaves, and the total number of leaves is the sum of the copies of each leaf. But note: the copies of a leaf are stored in the leaf node. However, the parent of a leaf (the node of length n-1) aggregates the two leaves. Then, the entire multiset size is the sum of the copies of all leaves. But note: the way we computed dp, the value for a leaf is the copies of that leaf, and the parent of the leaf is the sum of the two children (if the parent is a node of length n-1) and then capped by the parent's constraint.\n\n        However, the entire multiset is the set of leaves. The total multiset size is the sum of the copies of each leaf. But note: the copies of a leaf are stored in the leaf node. Then, the entire multiset size is the sum_{leaves} (copies of the leaf). \n\n        But wait: the parent of a leaf (the node of length n-1) is not storing the entire multiset, but the total copies of the two leaves. Then, the entire multiset size is the sum of the two children of the root (the two sets of leaves). \n\n        However, the root does not have a direct constraint. The entire multiset is the two sets. Then, the entire multiset size is:\n\n            T = dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"]\n\n        But wait, dp[\"0\"] is the total copies of leaves starting with '0', and dp[\"1\"] is the total copies of leaves starting with '1'. Then T is the entire multiset.\n\n        But note: the condition for the root's children is that dp[\"0\"] <= c_0 and dp[\"1\"] <= c_1. \n\n        Therefore, we have:\n\n            T = dp[\"0\"] + dp[\"1\"]\n            and we know dp[\"0\"] = min(c_0, dp[\"00\"]+dp[\"01\"])\n            and dp[\"1\"] = min(c_1, dp[\"10\"]+dp[\"11\"])\n\n        and so on.\n\n   Now, the problem is: we are free to choose the c_s for every node (every binary string of length from 1 to n). We want the number of assignments (each c_s in [0,k]) such that T = f.\n\n   How to count the assignments?\n\n   The challenge: n is at most 15, but k and f can be up to 200000. The total number of nodes is 2^(n+1)-2, which is about 2^16-2 = 65534, which is too many to iterate over if we try to iterate over all assignments (k^(number_of_nodes)).\n\n   We need to find a combinatorial or DP that aggregates the constraints.\n\n   Another observation:\n\n   The entire multiset size T is the sum of the two children of the root (the two halves). But note: the constraints are independent for the two halves? Actually, the constraints for the nodes in the \"0\" subtree and the \"1\" subtree are independent. However, the assignment for the root (c_0 and c_1) and the assignments for the children are independent.\n\n   But note: the entire assignment is independent: we assign to each node independently.\n\n   However, the value T is determined by the entire assignment. We need to count the assignments such that T = f.\n\n   We can try to use generating functions or inclusion-exclusion, but note that the structure is a complete binary tree of depth n.\n\n   Alternatively, note that the entire multiset size T is the result of a recursive min operation. We can think of the entire process as:\n\n        T = min(c_0, min(c_00, c_01) )? No, because the recurrence is:\n\n        Let g(s) = the value at node s (which is the maximum copies we can put in the subtree of s) = min(c_s, g(s0)+g(s1))\n\n        Then T = g(\"0\") + g(\"1\")\n\n   And g(s) depends on the entire subtree.\n\n   How can we decouple the assignment? \n\n   Observation: the assignment for the nodes that are not prefixes of each other are independent. But in a complete binary tree, every node is a prefix of two leaves (if we go to depth n). \n\n   We can use the following idea: \n\n        The entire assignment is independent, but the value T is determined by the assignments in a recursive min. \n\n        We can consider the entire tree and the effect of the constraints from the leaves upward.\n\n   However, note that the problem is symmetric in the two branches. Also, the structure is a complete binary tree.\n\n   Another idea: \n\n        Let F(n, x) be the number of ways to assign the constraints for a complete binary tree of depth n (with 2^n leaves) such that the total multiset size is x.\n\n        But note: the entire tree has 2^(n+1)-2 nodes.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a state that captures the minimal constraints along the path.\n\n   But note: the recurrence is:\n\n        g(s) = min(c_s, g(s0)+g(s1))\n\n   and the entire multiset size is g(\"0\")+g(\"1\").\n\n   We can use a bottom-up dynamic programming on the tree, but the state space is too large.\n\n   Insight:\n\n   The entire multiset size T is the minimum between the root constraint and the sum of the two children's g values. But the children's g values are determined by their own constraints and the leaves.\n\n   However, note: the leaves are the deepest nodes. The value for a leaf s is c_s (its own constraint). Then, the parent of the leaf (if any) is:\n\n        g(s) = min(c_s, ...) for the leaf, but wait: the leaf has no children, so the parent's constraint is the sum of the two leaves (if the parent is at depth n-1). Then, the parent's g value is min(c_parent, g(leaf0)+g(leaf1)).\n\n   But note: the parent's constraint c_parent is independent.\n\n   We can think: the entire multiset size T is determined by the constraints from the leaves up to the root. The minimal constraint along a path from a leaf to the root determines the maximum copies that can be put in that leaf's entire path.\n\n   Specifically, consider a leaf s. The copies of s that we can put is limited by the minimal constraint along the path from the leaf to the root (including the leaf itself). Why? \n\n        Let the path be: s = s0, s1, ..., sn (where sn is the leaf, and s0 is the root's child, and s1 is the next, etc.). Then, the copies of the leaf s is limited by the minimal c_t for t in the path (from the leaf to the root) because:\n\n          g(leaf) = c_leaf\n          g(parent of leaf) = min(c_parent, g(leaf0)+g(leaf1)) \n\n        But note: the leaf's copies are used in the parent's calculation. However, the entire leaf's copies are limited by the minimal constraint along the path.\n\n   Actually, the copies of a leaf s can be at most the minimal constraint along the path from the leaf to the root (including the leaf). Why?\n\n        Consider: the leaf's constraint is c_s. Then, the parent of the leaf (if exists) requires that the sum of the two leaves (including the current leaf) is <= c_{parent}. Then, the current leaf's copies cannot exceed c_{parent} (if the other leaf is at least 1, then the current leaf cannot exceed c_{parent} - (minimum the other leaf) ... but wait, the other leaf is independent.\n\n   Actually, the copies of a leaf s is limited by the minimal constraint along the path from the leaf to the root (including the leaf) and the structure of the min operations.\n\n   Let m(s) = min{ c_t | t is a prefix of s (from the leaf to the root) }\n\n   Then, the copies of the leaf s is at most m(s). Why? Because:\n\n        At the leaf: we cannot exceed c_leaf.\n        At the parent of the leaf: the total copies of the two leaves (including s) is <= c_{parent}. But the copies of the other leaf are at least 0, so the copies of s must be <= c_{parent}.\n        Then, at the grandparent: the total copies of the four leaves (two in each child) is <= c_{grandparent}, so the copies of s must be <= c_{grandparent} / (the factor of the subtree?) ... wait, no: the grandparent constraint is the sum of the two children (each child being a subtree of two leaves). The two children's g values are the minimum of the child's constraint and the sum of their two leaves. \n\n   Actually, the copies of a leaf s is limited by the minimal constraint along the path from the leaf to the root (including the leaf) and also the structure of the min operations in the parents.\n\n   But note: the entire multiset is built by the leaves. The condition for a node s is the sum of the copies of the leaves in its subtree. The copies of a leaf s is the same as the leaf's own constraint if the entire path from the leaf to the root has constraints that are not exceeded by the sum of the copies of the leaves in the subtrees.\n\n   However, a simpler idea: \n\n        The entire multiset size T is the sum_{leaf} (copies of leaf) and the copies of a leaf s is at most the minimal constraint along the path from the leaf to the root (including the leaf). \n\n   Why? Because the leaf's copies are constrained by the leaf's constraint and then by every parent's constraint (since the parent's constraint is the sum of the two children's copies, and the leaf is one of the children). Therefore, the leaf's copies cannot exceed the minimal constraint along the path.\n\n   Let m(s) = min_{t is a prefix of s (from the leaf to the root)} c_t.\n\n   Then, the copies of the leaf s cannot exceed m(s). Moreover, the entire multiset is the sum of the copies of all leaves, and the copies of each leaf s is at most m(s). \n\n   But note: the condition for a node s (non-leaf) is the sum of the copies of its two leaves (if node s has two leaves) must be <= c_s. However, if the minimal constraint along the path for the two leaves are different, then the copies of the two leaves are bounded by their own minimal constraints. Then, the sum of the two leaves might be limited by the minimum of the two minimal constraints (if the minimum is the same for both, then we can put up to 2*m(s) in the node's children, but the node's constraint is c_s, so we take min(c_s, ... )).\n\n   However, we can use the following:\n\n        The entire multiset size T is the sum_{leaf} x_leaf, where x_leaf is the number of copies of leaf.\n\n        And for every node s (non-leaf), the sum of the x_leaf for the leaves in the subtree of s is <= c_s.\n\n        And for every leaf s, x_leaf <= c_s.\n\n        But note: the condition for a node s is the sum of the x_leaf in its subtree, not just the leaf s. However, the minimal constraint along the path gives an upper bound for the leaf s: x_leaf <= m(s). Then, the entire multiset size T is the sum_{leaf} x_leaf, and each x_leaf <= m(s).\n\n        But the condition for a node s (non-leaf) is the sum of the x_leaf in its subtree <= c_s.\n\n        Now, if we let y_s = the minimal constraint along the path from s to the root (including s), then for a leaf s, y_s = m(s). For a non-leaf node s, y_s = min(c_s, y_{left_child}, y_{right_child})? Actually, no: the minimal constraint along the path is the minimum of c_s and the minimal constraints of its children? Actually, the minimal",
