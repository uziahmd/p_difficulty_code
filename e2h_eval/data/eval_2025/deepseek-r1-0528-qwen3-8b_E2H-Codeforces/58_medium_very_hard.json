You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are to find:\n   t = the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length (with more than one vertex)\n   w = the number of ways to add t edges to achieve that\n\n Conditions: \n   The graph is undirected, without parallel edges or loops, and not necessarily connected.\n\n Important: We cannot add parallel edges or loops.\n\n Observations:\n\n 1. Odd cycles: In an undirected graph, an odd cycle must have an odd number of edges (and vertices). \n    The smallest odd cycle is a triangle (3 edges, 3 vertices).\n\n 2. We are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (without creating parallel edges or loops) but we want the minimal t.\n\n Steps:\n\n Let's consider possibilities:\n\n Case 0: If the graph already contains an odd cycle, then t=0 and w=1 (but note: if there are multiple odd cycles? Actually, we don't need to count the ways if the condition is already satisfied? However, note: the problem asks for the minimum number of edges to add to form an odd cycle. So if the graph already has an odd cycle, then t=0, and w=1 (because we don't add any edge, and there is exactly one way: do nothing).\n\n But wait, note: the problem says \"form a simple cycle of an odd length\", so if the graph already has one, then we don't need to add any edge.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that we use the added edges to form the cycle. It just requires that after adding the edges, the graph has such a cycle.\n\n But note: the example input: \n   \"3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1\" -> output \"0 1\"\n\n So, we must check for existing odd cycles.\n\n How to check for odd cycles in an undirected graph?\n   We can do a BFS/DFS and check for odd-length cycles. However, note: the entire graph might be disconnected.\n\n Alternatively, we can use bipartite checking. A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycles.\n   Therefore, if the graph is not bipartite, then there is at least one odd cycle -> t=0, w=1.\n\n However, note: what if the graph has multiple components? Then we have to check each component for being bipartite.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"to form a simple cycle of an odd length\", so if there's already an odd cycle anywhere, then we are done.\n\n Now, if the graph is bipartite (so no odd cycles), then we must add edges to create an odd cycle.\n\n What is the minimal number of edges to add?\n\n Possibilities:\n\n Option 1: Add edges to form a triangle (a 3-cycle). This requires adding 3 edges if we have three isolated vertices? But note, we can also use existing edges.\n\n Actually, we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (but without creating duplicates). We are looking for the minimum number of edges to add so that the graph becomes non-bipartite.\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the cycle is formed only by the added edges. It can use existing edges and some added edges.\n\n So, we have two main cases:\n\n Case 1: The graph is not bipartite -> t=0, w=1.\n\n Case 2: The graph is bipartite. Then we need to add edges to break the bipartiteness.\n\n How many edges do we need to add to make a bipartite graph non-bipartite?\n\n Consider: A bipartite graph has two color sets (say black and white). In an odd cycle, we must have two adjacent vertices of the same color. So, to create an odd cycle, we can try to connect two vertices within the same set (then we get an odd cycle). \n\n But note: the minimal odd cycle is 3. So we can think:\n\n   - If we can form a triangle with two existing edges and one added edge? Actually, no: because the graph is bipartite, then between two vertices in the same set, there must be an even number of edges. However, we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (as long as we don't duplicate). We are looking for the minimal number of edges to add.\n\n What is the minimum t?\n\n   t=0: already done.\n\n   t>=1: when the graph is bipartite.\n\n   Consider: what if we add one edge? \n        - We connect two vertices in the same bipartition set. Then, we get an odd cycle? Not necessarily. Because the two vertices might be very far apart. But actually, if we connect two vertices u and v in the same set, then consider the path from u to v (if any) and the edge (u,v). The parity of the path plus one (the edge) will be even+1 = odd. But wait: if there is a path of even length from u to v, then the cycle would be of odd length. However, in a bipartite graph, the distance between two nodes in the same set is even. So the cycle length is (even + 1) which is odd. Therefore, adding one edge between two nodes of the same color set creates an odd cycle.\n\n   Therefore, in a connected bipartite graph, we can break bipartiteness by adding one edge (connecting two nodes of the same set). \n\n   But wait: what if the two nodes are not connected by a path? Then adding an edge between them doesn't form a cycle at all. So we require that the two nodes are in the same connected component (so that the path exists). Actually, if they are in different connected components, then adding an edge between two nodes in the same set (from two different components) still doesn't form a cycle (because the graph isn't connected). So we need to form a cycle.\n\n   Actually, the cycle must be formed by a closed walk. So if we add an edge between two nodes in the same set, then we require that there is a path (which is even) connecting them (so they are in the same connected component). Then the cycle is the path (even) plus the edge (one) -> odd.\n\n   Therefore, to form an odd cycle by adding one edge, the two nodes must be in the same connected component and of the same color.\n\n   But note: what if the graph is disconnected? Then we can also consider connecting two nodes from the same set in different connected components? Then we don't form a cycle (because we don't have a path). So we need to form a cycle. \n\n   Alternatively, we can form a cycle by adding two edges? \n\n   However, the minimal t is 1 if we can form an odd cycle by adding one edge (i.e., if there exists an edge that connects two nodes in the same set and they are in the same connected component). \n\n   But wait: in a bipartite graph, we can also have multiple connected components. In each connected component, we have two color sets. We can break bipartiteness by adding one edge in one connected component (if we connect two nodes of the same color in that component) OR we can also break bipartiteness by connecting two nodes from the same color set in two different components? \n\n   However, if we connect two nodes from the same color set in two different components, then we don't form a cycle (since the two components are disconnected). But then we can use two edges to form a triangle? Actually, we can form a cycle of length 3 by having two edges already present and one added. But wait, we can also form a cycle of length 5, etc.\n\n   However, note: we are allowed to add edges arbitrarily (anywhere). We are looking for the minimal t.\n\n   Let's consider:\n\n   Option: t=1.\n\n        Condition: There exists an edge we can add (i.e., a pair of vertices (u, v) that are not connected by an edge) such that:\n          - u and v are in the same connected component (so that the existing path from u to v is even) and u and v are the same color (so the cycle is odd).\n          OR\n          - u and v are in different connected components, then adding (u,v) does not form a cycle (because the graph remains acyclic for that cycle). So we cannot form an odd cycle with one edge if the two nodes are in different components.\n\n        Therefore, for t=1, we require that the edge (u,v) connects two nodes in the same connected component and of the same color, and that edge is not present.\n\n   Option: t=2.\n\n        How? We can add two edges to form a triangle. For example, if we have two vertices u and v (in the same component, say) and we add edges (u,v) and (u,w) and (v,w) then that would be too many. But wait, we can use existing edges.\n\n        Actually, we can look for two missing edges that together with an existing edge form a triangle. Or we can form a 5-cycle? But note: we are looking for minimal t, and we already considered t=0 and t=1. So if t=1 is not possible, then we consider t=2.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider: breaking bipartiteness by adding two edges. \n\n        Example: \n            Suppose we have two connected components (each bipartite). Then, we can connect the two components by adding two edges in such a way that we form an odd cycle.\n\n        However, note: the minimal t might be 1 (if there exists a pair of same-color nodes in the same component that are not connected). \n\n        Another possibility: if the graph is bipartite and connected, then we can break it by one edge (t=1). If the graph is bipartite and disconnected, then we might have to break one connected component (using one edge) so t=1 is still possible if in one of the components there exists a pair of same-color nodes (that are not adjacent) and then we can break that component.\n\n        But wait: in a disconnected graph, we can also break bipartiteness by connecting two nodes from the same color set in the same component (if any) OR if we don't have such a pair in the same component, then we cannot break with one edge? \n\n        Actually, in a disconnected graph, the bipartite coloring is independent per component. So for each component, we have two colors.\n\n        However, we can also consider connecting two nodes from the same color set in two different components? Then we don't form an odd cycle (because no path exists). But then we can use two edges to form a triangle? \n\n        Example: \n          Component1: {a, b} with edges (a,b) [so a and b are connected, and colored differently]. \n          Component2: {c, d} with edges (c,d) [colored differently].\n\n        Now, if we add two edges: (a,c) and (b,d). Then we have a cycle: a->c->d->b->a? That's a 4-cycle (even) -> not odd.\n\n        Alternatively, if we add (a,c) and (a,d): then we have edges: (a,b), (c,d), (a,c), (a,d). Then the cycle a->c->d->a is a triangle? No, because we don't have the edge (c,a) and (d,a) is present? Actually, we have a cycle: a->c->d->a: that's a triangle? No, that's a 3-cycle: a-c-d-a (edges: (a,c), (c,d), (d,a)) -> yes, that forms a triangle. \n\n        But note: the original graph has two edges (a,b) and (c,d). We added (a,c) and (d,a). Wait, we added two edges: (a,c) and (d,a). Then the cycle is a-c-d-a: which is a triangle. And the two edges we added are (a,c) and (a,d). But note: (a,d) is the same as (d,a). \n\n        However, in this example, we used two edges to form a triangle. But note: we could have done it by adding one edge if there was a pair of same-color nodes in the same component? \n\n        Let me check the coloring of the two components:\n\n        Component1: a (color0), b (color1).\n        Component2: c (color0), d (color1).\n\n        In Component1: same color: a and a (but we don't consider self-loop) or b and b. But we don't have multiple nodes of the same color? Actually, we have two nodes: one of color0 and one of color1.\n\n        Now, if we connect two nodes from the same color set (across components): \n          Option: connect two color0: a and c. Then, in Component1, the path from a to c: we don't have a path (they are in different components). So adding (a,c) doesn't form a cycle.\n\n        Similarly, two color1: b and d: same.\n\n        So in this disconnected graph, we cannot break bipartiteness with one edge. Then we must use two edges.\n\n        How many ways to break with two edges?\n\n        We need to form a triangle. The triangle must consist of three distinct vertices. The edges of the triangle must include two edges that we add and one edge that already exists? Or all three?\n\n        Actually, we can form a triangle by adding two edges if the third edge already exists. \n\n        In the example above, we added (a,c) and (a,d). The edge (c,d) already exists. So the triangle is (a,c,d) with edges (a,c), (a,d), and (c,d). \n\n        Alternatively, we might form a triangle by adding two edges that are part of the triangle and one edge is missing? Actually, we are free to use any existing edges.\n\n        Conditions for a triangle (three vertices x,y,z) to be formed: at least two edges must be present (either both (x,y) and (y,z) are missing, then we add (x,y) and (y,z) and then the cycle is x-y-z-x, but wait: we need the edge (x,z) to complete the triangle? Actually, no: the cycle x-y-z-x requires three edges. So if we add two edges, we are missing one edge. But wait, the problem doesn't require that the entire cycle is formed by the added edges. The existing edges can be used. \n\n        Actually, the cycle is defined by the entire graph after adding the edges.\n\n        However, note: the problem states that we are adding edges and the graph must contain an odd cycle. The cycle can use any edges (existing or added).\n\n        So, to form a triangle (a 3-cycle) we need three edges. If the graph already has two edges of a triangle, then we can complete the triangle by adding one edge. But wait, that would be t=1. \n\n        But wait: if the graph already has two edges of a triangle, then the two edges must form a path of two edges (say x-y and y-z). Then the cycle is x-y-z and then we need the edge x-z. But note: in a bipartite graph, if we have two edges (x-y and y-z) then the three vertices must be colored as: x and z must be the same color (because y is the opposite). Then the edge (x,z) would connect two same-colored nodes. So adding (x,z) would break bipartiteness and form a triangle (odd cycle). \n\n        Therefore, if there exists a path of two edges (so two consecutive edges) such that the two endpoints are the same color (and the edge (x,z) is missing), then we can break bipartiteness by adding one edge (t=1). \n\n        So why did the example above (disconnected graph) require two edges? Because in the disconnected graph, there was no two-edge path (within a connected component) that would connect two same-colored nodes (because the two-edge path would be from one component to another, but the two-edge path would go from one component to the other and then back? Actually, no, because the two components are disconnected. \n\n        Therefore, we must distinguish:\n\n        Case 2a: The graph is bipartite and connected. Then, if there exists an edge (u,v) such that u and v are same color and not connected by an edge, then we can break with t=1.\n\n        Case 2b: The graph is bipartite and disconnected. Then, we must check:\n\n            Subcase 2b1: There exists at least one connected component (with at least two vertices) that has at least two vertices of the same color (which it always does if the component has at least two nodes) and there exists a pair of same-color nodes (not adjacent) in that component. Then t=1.\n\n            Subcase 2b2: Otherwise, we cannot break with one edge. Then we must break with two edges.\n\n        However, note: in a connected bipartite graph, the coloring is fixed. In a connected bipartite graph, we can break with one edge if there is any missing edge between same-color nodes. \n\n        But what about the entire graph? The graph may have multiple components. In each component, we have two color sets. We can break the graph by adding an edge between two same-color nodes in any one component.\n\n        So the minimal t is 1 if there is at least one connected component (with at least two nodes) that has at least one missing edge between two same-color nodes.\n\n        How to check for t=1?\n\n          For each connected component (with n_i nodes and m_i edges), let the two color sets be A and B (so |A| and |B|). Then the total possible edges within the same color set is C(|A|,2) + C(|B|,2). The existing edges in the same color set are the ones that are already present (but in a bipartite graph, there should be none). So the number of missing same-color edges in the component is C(|A|,2) + C(|B|,2).\n\n          But note: the graph is bipartite, so by definition, there are no edges within A or within B. So all edges are between A and B. Therefore, the same-color edges are completely missing.\n\n          Then, the condition for a component to allow breaking with one edge is simply: the component has at least two nodes (so |A|>=2 or |B|>=2). Then the number of ways to break in that component is C(|A|,2) + C(|B|,2). \n\n          Then, the total ways for t=1 is the sum over all components of [C(|A|,2) + C(|B|,2)].\n\n          However, wait: we are counting the ways to add one edge that breaks the bipartiteness. Each such edge is uniquely identified by the two same-color nodes (and the edge is absent because the graph is bipartite and originally had no same-color edges). \n\n        But note: the problem says that we are prohibited to add parallel edges. Since the graph initially doesn't have any same-color edge, then every such pair is missing.\n\n        Therefore, if there exists at least one component with |A|>=2 or |B|>=2, then t=1, and the number of ways w = (for each component, the number of same-color pairs) summed over components.\n\n        However, wait: what if the graph is disconnected and one of the components has two nodes (so one edge) and the other component has two nodes (so one edge). Then the first component: |A|=1, |B|=1 -> no same-color edge. The second component: same. Then we cannot break with one edge? Then we must use two edges.\n\n        Example: two separate edges (two components, each an edge). Then the graph is bipartite. The total same-color pairs: in each component, |A|=1, |B|=1 -> no same-color edge. Then we cannot break with one edge.\n\n        Then we consider t=2.\n\n        How to break with two edges?\n\n        We need to form an odd cycle. The smallest odd cycle is 3. We can form a triangle by adding two edges (if we have a path of two edges, but we don't). Alternatively, we can form a triangle by connecting three nodes from two components.\n\n        Example: \n          Component1: {a, b} (edge a-b)\n          Component2: {c, d} (edge c-d)\n\n        We can form a triangle by adding two edges: for example, connect a to c and a to d. Then the cycle a-c-d-a is a triangle (if the edge c-d is present). But note: we added two edges (a,c) and (a,d) and the edge (c,d) exists. \n\n        Alternatively, we can form a triangle by connecting a to c and then we need two edges from c to two other nodes? Actually, we can choose three nodes from two components? \n\n        Actually, we can form a triangle by selecting three nodes: two from one component and one from another? But then we have two nodes from the same component (say a and b) and one from the other (c). Then the edges: we have a-b (present), and we add a-c and b-c. Then the cycle is a-b-c-a. This is a triangle. \n\n        But wait: the edge a-b is already present, and we add two edges: a-c and b-c. Then the cycle is a-b-c-a: which uses the existing edge a-b and the two added edges.\n\n        However, note: the coloring in the two components is independent. Let's assign colors:\n\n          Component1: a: color0, b: color1.\n          Component2: c: color0, d: color1.\n\n        Then, if we add edges (a,c) and (b,c): \n          a and c: color0 and color0 -> same color, but wait, we are adding an edge between two same-color nodes? Actually, in the entire graph, after adding (a,c), we break the bipartiteness (if we only add (a,c)), but then we are adding two edges. However, the cycle a-b-c-a: the edges are (a,b) [color0-color1], (b,c) [color1-color0] (if we assume the new edge (b,c) is between color1 and color0, which is fine) and (c,a) [color0-color0] (same color). \n\n        But note: the edge (c,a) is the same as (a,c). \n\n        However, in the entire graph, the coloring might change? Actually, we broke the bipartiteness when we added (a,c). Then the entire graph is no longer bipartite. But we are adding two edges.\n\n        The problem: we are adding two edges and then the graph becomes non-bipartite. We don't require the intermediate steps to be bipartite.\n\n        How to count the ways for t=2?\n\n        We need to form a triangle (a 3-cycle) by adding two edges. The third edge must be present (because we are only allowed to add two). \n\n        Conditions for a triangle (x,y,z):\n          - The edge (x,z) must be missing (so we add it) and (x,y) and (y,z) must be present? Or we can have two edges present and one missing? Actually, we can have:\n\n          Option 1: Two edges are present and one is missing. Then we add the missing one.\n\n          Option 2: Only one edge is present and we add two edges to form the triangle? But then the cycle is not simple? Actually, the cycle must be a triangle, so we need three edges.\n\n        Therefore, to form a triangle, we need at least two edges to be present (because we are only adding two edges, so one edge must already exist). \n\n        However, wait: we are allowed to add two edges arbitrarily. We can also form a cycle of length 5? But we are looking for minimal t. We know t=0 and t=1 are not available, so we consider t=2.\n\n        The minimal odd cycle is 3. So we must form a triangle.\n\n        Conditions for forming a triangle with two edges added:\n\n          There must be a pair of edges (or one edge and then the two added edges form two sides) such that the three edges together form a triangle.\n\n        Actually, we can break it down:\n\n          We need three distinct vertices (x,y,z). The triangle requires the three edges (x,y), (y,z), (z,x). \n\n          We are going to add two edges. So we must have one edge already present.\n\n          Therefore, we must have one edge (say (x,y)) and then we add (y,z) and (z,x). \n\n          Alternatively, we can have two edges already present (say (x,y) and (y,z)) and then we add (z,x). \n\n          But note: the problem is to count the ways to add two edges (any two edges) that result in an odd cycle. However, we are constrained by the fact that we are forming a triangle (the minimal odd cycle) and that we are breaking bipartiteness.\n\n        However, note: we might form an odd cycle that is not a triangle? For example, a 5-cycle. But the minimal t is 2, and we are looking for the minimal number of edges to add. But note: sometimes 2 edges might be necessary and sufficient, and we don't care about larger cycles.\n\n        But the problem: the minimal number of edges to add. We are trying to find the minimal t. We already know t=0 (if exists) and t=1 (if exists). So for t=2, we are considering the next minimal.\n\n        However, is it possible that t=2 is not enough to form an odd cycle? Then we would have to go to t=3? \n\n        Actually, we can always form an odd cycle by adding enough edges. The minimal t is either 0,1, or 2, or maybe 3?\n\n        Let me think: \n\n        In a bipartite graph, we can break bipartiteness by connecting two same-color nodes (if they are in the same component) with one edge (t=1). If not, then we can break by adding two edges to form a triangle (using one existing edge and two added edges). \n\n        But wait: is it always possible to form a triangle by adding two edges? \n\n        We need to have one edge already in the graph. However, if the graph has no edges at all, then we cannot form a triangle by adding two edges (because we need three edges). Then we must add three edges (a triangle from scratch). \n\n        Example: n=3, m=0. Then the graph is three isolated nodes. The graph is bipartite (each node is its own set). Then we can break by adding three edges (forming a triangle) or by adding fewer? \n\n        However, note: we can break bipartiteness by adding one edge? Then we need two same-color nodes. The graph has three nodes: we can color them as {0,1,0}. Then the two zeros are same color. Then adding an edge between the two zeros would break bipartiteness (if they are in the same component? Actually, they are in separate components). Then we cannot break with one edge (because they are in different components). \n\n        Then we must break with two edges? \n\n        Let me check: \n          We have three nodes: a, b, c. \n          We add two edges: say (a,b) and (b,c). Then the graph has edges (a,b) and (b,c). This is a path of two edges (which is even) and does not form a cycle. Then we don't have an odd cycle. \n\n          Alternatively, we add (a,b) and (a,c). Then the graph has edges (a,b) and (a,c). This is a star and no cycle. \n\n          Alternatively, we add (a,b) and (c,a). Then the graph has edges (a,b) and (a,c). Still no cycle.\n\n          Actually, we need to form a cycle. To form a cycle, we need to have a connection from b to c or from a to somewhere else. \n\n          We must form a triangle. We need to add three edges: (a,b), (b,c), (c,a). Then we have a triangle.\n\n        Therefore, in the case of three isolated nodes (n=3, m=0) we need t=3.\n\n        So the minimal t can be 0,1,2,3.\n\n        Therefore, we must consider:\n\n        Step 1: Check if the graph is non-bipartite (already has an odd cycle). Then t=0, w=1.\n\n        Step 2: If bipartite, then:\n\n          Let comp = list of connected components, each with (set_A, set_B) and the sizes.\n\n          Let same_color_edges_needed_component = for each component, the number of same-color edges that are missing (which is C(|set_A|,2)+C(|set_B|,2))\n\n          Then, if there is any component with same_color_edges_needed_component > 0 (i.e., |set_A|>=2 or |set_B|>=2), then t=1, and w = sum(same_color_edges_needed_component for all components).\n\n        Step 3: Else (all components are singletons: each component has at most one node) then we cannot break with one edge (because each component has only one node, so no two same-color nodes in the same component). Then we must consider t=2 and t=3.\n\n          Now, we are in the situation where every connected component is a single node (because if a component has two nodes, then we would have broken the condition above). \n\n          Actually, wait: what if a component has two nodes? Then we have two nodes and one edge. Then the two nodes are in different sets (so |set_A|=1, |set_B|=1). Then same_color_edges_needed_component = 0. \n\n          Therefore, the condition for t=1 is only met if there is a component with at least two nodes in one set. \n\n          So if the graph is bipartite and has no component with more than one node (i.e., the graph has no edges and n components, each a singleton) then we are in the situation where we cannot break with one edge.\n\n          Then we consider t=2.\n\n          How to break with two edges? \n\n          We need to form a triangle. But the graph has no edges. Then we must add three edges for a triangle. \n\n          Alternatively, we can form an odd cycle of length 5? \n\n          However, note: the minimal odd cycle is 3. So we must form a triangle. But we have no edges. Then we need to add three edges.\n\n          But wait: maybe we can form an odd cycle that is not a triangle? For example, a 5-cycle. Then we need 5 edges? \n\n          However, the problem: we are to minimize the number of edges to add. \n\n          Actually, we can form a triangle by adding three edges. \n\n          But is there a way to break bipartiteness by adding two edges? \n\n          Consider: We have n isolated nodes. We color them arbitrarily (each in its own set). Then we break bipartiteness by connecting two nodes (same color) and then ... but wait, two edges: \n\n          Example: n=4. Then we can form a triangle? Actually, we need three edges for a triangle. But we can form an odd cycle of length 5 by adding two edges? \n\n          Actually, an odd cycle must have at least 3 edges. \n\n          With two edges, we can form a path of two edges. Then we don't have a cycle. \n\n          Therefore, we cannot form an odd cycle with two edges (because the smallest cycle is 3). \n\n          Then, if the graph is bipartite and has no component with two nodes (so all components are singletons) then we must add three edges (to form a triangle). \n\n          However, wait: what if we have four nodes? Then we can form a triangle (three nodes) by adding three edges. \n\n          But note: the graph is bipartite and has no edges. Then the entire graph is bipartite. To form an odd cycle, we need at least three edges (a triangle). \n\n          Therefore, in the case of no edges, the minimal t is 3.\n\n          However, wait: if we have two edges, we can form a cycle? \n\n          Actually, two edges: we can form a cycle of length 2? But that is not allowed (no loops and no parallel edges, and a cycle must have at least 3 edges). \n\n          Therefore, the minimal t is 3.\n\n        But wait: what if the graph has multiple isolated nodes? We can form a triangle by selecting three nodes and adding three edges. \n\n        However, we can also form a cycle of length 5? Then we would need to add 5 edges (if the graph has no edges). But that is worse (more edges). \n\n        Therefore, the minimal t is 3.\n\n        However, wait: is there a way to break bipartiteness with two edges? \n\n        Consider: we have four nodes: a, b, c, d. We color them arbitrarily (each in its own set). Then we add two edges: (a,b) and (c,d). Then the graph is still bipartite (each edge is between distinct sets, and the sets are independent). Then we haven't broken bipartiteness.\n\n        Alternatively, we add two edges: (a,b) and (b,c). Then we have a path a-b-c. Then we break bipartiteness? No, because the graph is still bipartite: we can recolor? Actually, we cannot recolor arbitrarily. \n\n        The bipartite condition is that the graph is 2-colorable. The graph with edges (a,b) and (b,c) is bipartite: set {a,c} and {b}. \n\n        Then we add a third edge (a,c): then we break. But that is three edges.\n\n        Therefore, we must add three edges.\n\n        So the minimal t is 3.\n\n        But wait: what if we have two edges that are crossing? For example, in four nodes: a, b, c, d. We add (a,c) and (b,d). Then the graph is two disjoint edges. Then we can recolor: set {a,b} and {c,d} (if we started with each node in its own set, then we can reassign: a and b to set0, and c and d to set1). \n\n        Actually, the bipartite condition is independent of the initial coloring. We can always recolor. \n\n        The graph is bipartite if and only if it does not contain an odd cycle. \n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of edges to add is the minimal number such that the graph becomes non-bipartite.\n\n        Known: \n          t=0: if the graph is non-bipartite.\n          t=1: if the graph is bipartite and there exists a missing same-color edge in the same connected component (and the two nodes are in the same component).\n          t=2: if the graph is bipartite and there is no missing same-color edge in the same component (so each connected component is either a singleton or an edge) then we cannot break with one edge. Then we must break with two edges? \n\n        But wait: in the example above with two separate edges (two components, each an edge) we saw that we can break with two edges (by forming a triangle). \n\n        However, in that example, we didn't use two edges to break bipartiteness, but we used two edges to form a triangle (which requires three edges in total). \n\n        Actually, the problem: we are to form an odd cycle. The odd cycle is a triangle (three edges). The graph originally has two edges. Then we add two edges. Then the graph has four edges. The triangle is formed by three edges: two from the original and two added? Actually, the triangle is formed by two original edges and two added edges? \n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n        Original edges: (a,b) and (c,d). \n        Added edges: (a,c) and (a,d). \n        Then the edges of the triangle: (a,c), (c,d), (d,a) -> the edge (c,d) is original, and (a,c) and (a,d) are added. So the cycle is a-c-d-a. \n\n        This cycle uses three edges: two added and one original.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for t=2 is: \n\n          We can form an odd cycle by adding two edges if there exists a set of three nodes (x,y,z) such that:\n\n            - The edge (x,z) is missing (so we add it)\n            - The edges (x,y) and (y,z) are present (so we don't need to add them) OR \n            - The edges (x,y) and (z,y) are present (then the cycle is x-y-z-x, which requires the edge (x,z) to be added) OR \n            - The edges (x,y) and (x,z) are present and (y,z) is missing? Then we would form a triangle by adding (y,z) (so that would be one edge, but then we are in t=1). \n\n        Actually, we are allowed to use any edges (existing or added). The cycle must be simple and odd.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal t is:\n\n          t=0: if the graph is non-bipartite.\n\n          t=1: if the graph is bipartite and there exists at least one connected component (with at least two nodes) that has at least",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to a given undirected graph so that it contains at least one simple cycle of odd length, and the number of ways to add those edges.

The number of such pairs across all components gives the number of ways to add one edge to form an odd cycle.\n   - **Case 2 (t=2 or t=3)**: If no such pairs exist (i.e., each component is either a single vertex or an edge), then:\n     - **t=2**: If there are at least three vertices, we can form a triangle by adding two edges (using one existing edge and two new edges).\n     - **t=3**: If the graph has fewer than three vertices, we need to add three edges to form a triangle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(m):\n        u = int(data[index]); v = int(data[index+1]); index += 2\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n        \n    visited = [False] * (n+1)\n    color = [-1] * (n+1)\n    bipartite = True\n    components = []\n    comp_id = [-1] * (n+1)\n    comp_count = 0\n    comp_nodes = []\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            comp_count += 1\n            comp_nodes.append([])\n            q = deque([i])\n            visited[i] = True\n            color[i] = 0\n            nodes_in_comp = [i]\n            comp_id[i] = comp_count\n            while q:\n                node = q.popleft()\n                for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                    if not visited[neighbor]:\n                        visited[neighbor] = True\n                        color[neighbor] = color[node] ^ 1\n                        q.append(neighbor)\n                        nodes_in_comp.append(neighbor)\n                        comp_id[neighbor] = comp_count\n                    else:\n                        if color[neighbor] == color[node]:\n                            bipartite = False\n            comp_nodes[-1] = nodes_in_comp\n\n    if not bipartite:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n\n    same_color_pairs = 0\n    for nodes in comp_nodes:\n        setA = 0\n        setB = 0\n        for node in nodes:\n            if color[node] == 0:\n                setA += 1\n            else:\n                setB += 1\n        same_color_pairs += setA*(setA-1)//2 + setB*(setB-1)//2\n\n    if same_color_pairs > 0:\n        print(f\"1 {same_color_pairs}\")\n        return\n\n    total_vertices = n\n    if total_vertices >= 3:\n        print(\"2 0\")\n    else:\n        print(\"3 1\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and parsed into the number of vertices (n) and edges (m), followed by the edges themselves.\n2. **Graph Construction**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list.\n3. **Bipartite Check**: Using BFS, each connected component is checked for bipartiteness. If any component is found to be non-bipartite, the graph already contains an odd cycle, so the answer is (0, 1).\n4. **Same-Color Pairs Calculation**: For each bipartite component, count the number of vertex pairs within the same partition that are not connected by an edge. This count determines if adding one edge can create an odd cycle.\n5. **Edge Addition Scenarios**:\n   - If there are same-color pairs, output (1, count) since adding one edge between any such pair creates an odd cycle.\n   - If no such pairs exist but there are at least three vertices, output (2, 0) because two edges are needed to form a triangle (though no valid configurations exist for t=1).\n   - If the graph has fewer than three vertices, output (3, 1) as three edges are needed to form a triangle. \n\nThis approach efficiently checks the graph's properties and determines the minimal edge additions required to form an odd cycle, along with the number of ways to achieve this.",
