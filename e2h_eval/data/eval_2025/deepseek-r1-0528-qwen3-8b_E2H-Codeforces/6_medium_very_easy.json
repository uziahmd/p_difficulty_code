Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given: n, x and then n lines of (l, r, cost)\n We need to choose two distinct vouchers i and j such that:\n  1. Their durations add up to x: (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x\n  2. They do not intersect: either the first ends before the second starts (r_i < l_j) or the second ends before the first starts (r_j < l_i)\n\n Steps:\n\n Let d_i = duration of voucher i = (r_i - l_i + 1)\n\n We are looking for two vouchers i and j with:\n   d_i + d_j = x, and they are non-overlapping.\n\n We can try to group the vouchers by their duration. Then, for each duration d (which must be <= x), we look for a complementary duration (x-d) in another group.\n\n However, we also have the condition of non-overlapping. So even if two vouchers have durations adding to x, they might still overlap.\n\n Approach:\n\n 1. Precompute the duration for each voucher and store the vouchers by their duration. But note: multiple vouchers can have the same duration.\n\n 2. We cannot check all pairs because n and x can be up to 200,000.\n\n Alternate idea:\n\n Let's define an array `min_cost_by_duration` for each duration d (from 1 to max_d, which is at most 200000) as the minimum cost for a voucher of duration d that has a particular property? But wait, the non-overlapping condition depends on the intervals [l, r].\n\n However, note: two vouchers with durations d1 and d2 (d1+d2=x) must not overlap.\n\n How to ensure non-overlapping? The condition is: \n   Either [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] satisfy r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1.\n\n But note: the two vouchers can be taken in any order. We don't know which one is taken first.\n\n Actually, we can assume without loss of generality that one voucher starts after the other ends. But we don't know which one is taken first.\n\n We can consider two cases: \n   Case 1: The first voucher (with duration d1) ends before the second (duration d2) starts: r1 < l2.\n   Case 2: The second voucher ends before the first starts: r2 < l1.\n\n However, note that the total duration is fixed (x). But we are free to choose the order.\n\n So we can think: we need to find two vouchers (i and j) with durations d and x-d, and then check if either the first voucher ends before the second starts or vice versa.\n\n But how to do this without checking every pair?\n\n We can precompute for each duration d (if it exists) the set of intervals (or rather, we want to know the minimal cost and the minimal ending time?).\n\n Alternatively, we can store for each duration d:\n\n   Option 1: For each duration d, we want to record the minimal cost and the earliest ending time (r) and the latest starting time (l)? Not exactly.\n\n Actually, we need to check non-overlapping. For two durations d and x-d:\n\n   Condition 1: There exist two vouchers i (duration d) and j (duration x-d) such that r_i < l_j.\n   Condition 2: There exist two vouchers i (duration x-d) and j (duration d) such that r_j < l_i.\n\n But note: the two vouchers are distinct and we don't know which one is which. However, we can break it into two parts:\n\n   We need two intervals: one of duration d and one of duration (x-d) that do not overlap.\n\n   Without loss of generality, we can require that the interval of duration d must end before the interval of duration (x-d) starts, OR the interval of duration (x-d) must end before the interval of duration d.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify which voucher comes first. So we have two possibilities:\n\n   Possibility 1: The first voucher (say of duration d) ends before the second (duration x-d) starts: so we require r1 < l2.\n\n   Possibility 2: The second voucher (of duration x-d) ends before the first (duration d) starts: so we require r2 < l1.\n\n However, we are allowed to assign the two vouchers arbitrarily to the two parts of the vacation? Actually, the two vouchers must cover consecutive days? Not necessarily: the entire vacation is x days, but the two vouchers are two separate trips. The condition is just that they don't overlap.\n\n But note: the entire vacation is exactly x days. However, the problem does not specify that the two trips must be contiguous. The condition is only about non-overlapping. So the two vouchers can be taken in any order and there's no requirement that the entire vacation is filled.\n\n However, the total duration of the two trips is x. This means that if we take two trips, the sum of their durations is x. But note: the two trips are taken during the vacation of x days. However, the problem does not say that the entire vacation must be used. But the condition is that the two trips do not overlap, and the sum of their durations is x.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Leha wants to split his own vacation into two parts\", meaning that the two trips together use x days? Or the two trips are two separate vacations that must fit within the x-day vacation? \n\n But note: the problem says \"split his own vacation of exactly x days\". And the two trips are two separate vouchers. The condition is that the two vouchers do not intersect and the sum of their durations is x. There is no requirement that the two trips are consecutive or that they fill the entire x days.\n\n However, the problem does not say that the two trips must be contained in the x days? Actually, the problem says: \"The duration of the i-th voucher is ri - li + 1\" and the condition is that the two durations sum to x.\n\n Since the entire vacation is x days, and the two trips are two separate periods (non-overlapping) that together last x days, then the two trips must form a partition of the x days? \n\n But note: the problem does not require that the two trips are adjacent. They just don't overlap. So we can take two trips that are disjoint and the total time they occupy is x days.\n\n However, the problem does not specify that the two trips must be contained in the x days. Actually, the problem says: \"Leha wants to split his own vacation of exactly x days\", meaning that the entire vacation is x days. So the two trips must be taken during these x days. But the condition for non-overlapping is independent of the x days? Actually, the condition for non-overlapping is purely based on the intervals.\n\n But note: the problem does not say that the two trips must be contained in the [1, x] or something. The days are absolute. The condition is just that the two intervals (vouchers) do not overlap.\n\n However, the example: \n   Input: \"4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4\"\n   Output: 5\n\n Here, the two chosen vouchers are [1,3] and [5,6]. The entire vacation is 5 days. The two trips are from day1 to day3 (3 days) and day5 to day6 (2 days). The total duration is 5, and they don't overlap.\n\n But note: the two trips do not necessarily cover the entire vacation? They cover 3+2=5 days, but the vacation is 5 days. However, the problem does not say that the two trips must cover the entire vacation, but the condition is that the sum of their durations is exactly x. \n\n Actually, the problem states: \"the sum of their durations is exactly x\", so that's the requirement.\n\n Now, how to solve:\n\n We are to find two distinct vouchers i and j such that:\n   (r_i - l_i + 1) + (r_j - l_j + 1) = x   => d_i + d_j = x\n\n And the two intervals do not overlap.\n\n We can do:\n\n   Step 1: Group the vouchers by duration. Let `groups` be a dictionary mapping duration d to a list of (l, r, cost) for each voucher of duration d.\n\n   Step 2: We are interested only in durations d and x-d (for d from 1 to (x-1)//2, and then also the symmetric case when d > x-d, but we can avoid duplicates by iterating d from 1 to floor(x/2)).\n\n   However, note: if x is even, then d = x/2 is a special case? But the two vouchers must be distinct. So if we have two vouchers of the same duration d (and d = x/2) then we cannot use two identical ones? Actually, we can use two different vouchers of the same duration, but then the condition is that they don't overlap.\n\n   But wait: the problem says two distinct vouchers (i≠j). So if two vouchers have the same duration, they are distinct.\n\n   Step 3: For each duration d (where d <= x-d) we consider two groups: group1 = group[d] and group2 = group.get(x-d, []) (if d != x-d, then we have two distinct groups; if d==x-d, then we are considering the same group but distinct vouchers).\n\n   Step 4: Now, we need to check non-overlapping between a voucher from group1 and a voucher from group2.\n\n   However, we cannot iterate over all pairs because the number of vouchers in a group can be large.\n\n   Instead, we can precompute for each group (for each duration) some structures that help us quickly find a voucher that does not overlap with a given voucher.\n\n   But note: we are looking for two vouchers (one from group1, one from group2) that do not overlap. We want the minimal total cost.\n\n   How to check non-overlapping? Two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] do not overlap if b < c or d < a.\n\n   Since we are going to consider two cases (first voucher ends before second starts, and second voucher ends before first starts), we can do:\n\n   Case 1: The first voucher (from group1) ends before the second voucher (from group2) starts: so we require that for a voucher (l1, r1) from group1 and (l2, r2) from group2, we have r1 < l2.\n\n   Case 2: The second voucher (from group2) ends before the first voucher (from group1) starts: so r2 < l1.\n\n   But note: the two vouchers are interchangeable. We don't know which one is taken first.\n\n   However, we can break the problem into two independent cases:\n\n   Case A: The voucher from group1 ends before the voucher from group2 starts.\n        Condition: r1 < l2\n\n   Case B: The voucher from group2 ends before the voucher from group1 starts.\n        Condition: r2 < l1\n\n   But note: we are allowed to assign the two vouchers arbitrarily. However, we can fix the assignment: if we choose a voucher from group1 and one from group2, then we can consider two possibilities: \n        Possibility 1: Use the group1 voucher first and then group2.\n        Possibility 2: Use the group2 voucher first and then group1.\n\n   Actually, we don't need to assign which one is first because the non-overlapping condition is symmetric in the sense that we require one ends before the other starts. But note: the condition is defined by the intervals.\n\n   However, we must consider both orders because the two groups are defined by the two durations (d and x-d). \n\n   But note: the condition for non-overlapping is independent of the order: the two intervals must not overlap. However, the condition for non-overlapping is that either the first ends before the second starts OR the second ends before the first starts. But if we fix the order (which one is taken first) then we can only use one condition. However, the problem does not specify the order.\n\n   Actually, we can consider:\n\n        Condition 1: (voucher1) ends before (voucher2) starts -> then we can take voucher1 first and then voucher2.\n        Condition 2: (voucher2) ends before (voucher1) starts -> then we can take voucher2 first and then voucher1.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require that the two trips are taken in a specific order. So we are allowed to take either one first.\n\n   Therefore, we can break the problem into two independent subproblems for each pair of groups (d and x-d):\n\n        Subproblem 1: Find a voucher in group1 (duration d) and a voucher in group2 (duration x-d) such that r1 < l2. Then the total cost is cost1 + cost2.\n\n        Subproblem 2: Find a voucher in group1 and a voucher in group2 such that r2 < l1. Then the total cost is cost1 + cost2.\n\n   But wait, note: in the second subproblem, the condition is that the voucher from group2 ends before the voucher from group1 starts. In this case, we are taking the group2 voucher first and then group1.\n\n   However, we must consider: the two vouchers are distinct and we are free to assign the order arbitrarily. But the condition for non-overlapping is symmetric: the two intervals must not overlap. So if we have two intervals [a,b] and [c,d], then they do not overlap if and only if (b < c) OR (d < a). \n\n   Therefore, we can combine the two conditions: we require that either the first ends before the second starts OR the second ends before the first starts.\n\n   But note: the two conditions are mutually exclusive (unless the intervals are adjacent, but adjacent is allowed because then one ends exactly at the start of the other, and the condition is strict inequality? Actually, the condition is at least one holds: so if one ends exactly at the start of the other, then the condition holds). However, the problem says \"don't intersect\", and typically intervals [a,b] and [b+1, c] do not intersect. But what about [a,b] and [b, c]? They intersect at day b? Actually, the problem says: two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, and the condition is either ri < lj or rj < li. Note: the condition uses strict inequalities.\n\n   So [a,b] and [b, c] would have r1 = b and l2 = b -> then condition is not satisfied (because we require ri < lj, but b < b is false) and similarly for the other condition. So they do intersect.\n\n   Therefore, we must use strict inequalities.\n\n   Now, how to efficiently solve for a given pair of groups (d and x-d)?\n\n   We need to find the minimum total cost (cost1 + cost2) such that either:\n        (voucher1: duration d, voucher2: duration x-d) satisfies r1 < l2 OR (voucher2: duration x-d, voucher1: duration d) satisfies r2 < l1.\n\n   However, note: we are free to assign the order arbitrarily, so we can consider:\n\n        Option 1: Take voucher1 (from group1) first and voucher2 (from group2) second -> condition: r1 < l2.\n        Option 2: Take voucher2 (from group2) first and voucher1 (from group1) second -> condition: r2 < l1.\n\n   So we are effectively looking for:\n\n        min_{(l1, r1, cost1) in group1, (l2, r2, cost2) in group2} { cost1+cost2 } such that (r1 < l2) OR (r2 < l1)\n\n   But note: we are not forced to assign the order arbitrarily. We are simply looking for two intervals that do not overlap.\n\n   We can reframe: we need two intervals I1 (duration d) and I2 (duration x-d) such that I1 and I2 do not overlap. This is equivalent to: \n        (I1 is completely before I2) OR (I2 is completely before I1)\n\n   So we can break into two separate queries:\n\n        Query 1: For group1 and group2, find the minimum cost1 + cost2 such that there exists an interval I1 in group1 and I2 in group2 with r1 < l2.\n\n        Query 2: Similarly, for group1 and group2, find the minimum cost1 + cost2 such that there exists an interval I2 in group2 and I1 in group1 with r2 < l1.\n\n   Then, the answer for this pair (d, x-d) is the minimum of the two query results (if both are found).\n\n   But note: the two queries are independent.\n\n   Now, how to do Query 1 for a fixed pair (group1, group2) without iterating over all pairs?\n\n   For Query 1: We want to minimize cost1 + cost2, subject to r1 < l2.\n\n   We can preprocess:\n\n        For group1: we want to consider the minimal cost for a voucher that ends by at most some value (since we require r1 < l2, so for a fixed voucher2 with start l2, we need r1 < l2). Similarly, we can preprocess group1 by storing the minimal cost for any voucher ending at or below a certain value.\n\n        Alternatively, for group2: we can consider the minimal cost for a voucher that starts at or above a certain value (l2). Then, for each voucher2 in group2, we look for the best voucher1 in group1 that ends before l2.\n\n   But we want the minimal total cost. We can do:\n\n        Step 1: Precompute for group1 an array (or a Fenwick tree / segment tree) that maps an ending day (r) to the minimal cost for a voucher in group1 that ends at r (or has ending <= some value). Actually, we want to quickly get the minimal cost for any voucher in group1 that ends before a given day L (which is the l2).\n\n        Step 2: Similarly, for group2, we have vouchers (l2, r2, cost2). For each voucher2, we look at the minimal cost from group1 for all vouchers with r1 < l2. Then the candidate is (min_cost_from_group1_before_l2) + cost2.\n\n        Then we take the minimum candidate over all voucher2.\n\n   Similarly, for Query 2: We want to minimize cost1 + cost2 such that r2 < l1.\n\n        Step 1: Precompute for group2 an array (by ending day) for minimal cost in group2 for each ending (or again, we want the minimal cost for group2 ending before a given l1).\n\n        Step 2: For each voucher1 in group1, we look for the minimal cost in group2 for vouchers with r2 < l1.\n\n   However, note: we are grouping by duration, and the same duration might appear in multiple groups (if d != x-d, then two separate groups; if d == x-d, then we are using the same group for both queries? Actually, no: in the case d = x-d, we are considering two vouchers from the same group (but distinct). Then we must be careful: we cannot use the same voucher twice.\n\n   But the problem says two distinct vouchers (i≠j). So in the case d = x-d, we are allowed to use two different vouchers from the same group.\n\n   However, in our two queries for the same group (when d == x-d) we must not use the same voucher twice. But note: we are breaking the problem into two independent queries, and in each query we are taking one voucher from group1 and one from group2. But if d==x-d, then group1 and group2 are the same. Then we are effectively doing:\n\n        Query 1: For a voucher1 and voucher2 (both from the same group) with r1 < l2 (and they are distinct).\n        Query 2: For a voucher2 and voucher1 (same condition) with r2 < l1 (distinct).\n\n   But note: the condition for Query 1 and Query 2 are symmetric, and we are essentially looking for two distinct vouchers from the same group (with duration d=x-d) that do not overlap.\n\n   However, we must avoid using the same voucher twice. But since we are storing the entire group, and we are iterating independently, we might accidentally use the same voucher twice? \n\n   Actually, in the two queries we are treating the same group as two independent sets. But we are allowed to use two distinct vouchers from the same group. The issue is that in Query 1 we are only considering pairs (v1, v2) and in Query 2 we are considering (v2, v1). But note: the condition for Query 1 is r1 < l2, and for Query 2 is r2 < l1. These are two different conditions.\n\n   However, we must ensure that in the case of the same group, we do not use the same voucher in both queries? Actually, no: the two queries are independent and we are looking for the minimal cost. We are going to combine the two queries and then take the minimum over all pairs that satisfy the condition.\n\n   But wait: in the same group, we have a set S. Then we are going to consider:\n\n        Query 1: For each voucher2 in S (as the second voucher), we look for a voucher1 in S (as the first) with r1 < l2 and distinct from voucher2.\n\n        Query 2: Similarly, for each voucher1 in S (as the first), we look for a voucher2 in S (as the second) with r2 < l1 and distinct from voucher1.\n\n   But note: the same pair (v1, v2) might be considered in both queries? Actually, no: in Query 1 the condition is r1 < l2, and in Query 2 the condition is r2 < l1. These conditions are different. However, a pair (v1, v2) can satisfy one condition and not the other.\n\n   However, we are allowed to use either order. But note: the condition for non-overlapping is symmetric: we require either r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1. So we are effectively covering both orders.\n\n   But note: the two conditions are not the same. For example, if we have two intervals [1,2] and [3,4] then condition1: 2<3 is true, condition2: 4<1 is false. So only condition1 holds.\n\n   Therefore, we can handle the case d == x-d separately? Actually, no: the same algorithm should work.\n\n   However, we must avoid using the same voucher twice. How? \n\n   In Query 1, we are taking a voucher1 from group1 and voucher2 from group2. In the case of the same group, we are taking two vouchers from the same set. We must ensure that we are not using the same element twice. But the problem requires distinct vouchers.\n\n   How can we do that? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        For Query 1: We require that the voucher1 and voucher2 are distinct. But we are storing the entire group. We can precompute for the group (say for group1) an array `min_cost_by_end` that gives the minimal cost for any voucher in the group (including itself) that ends at a particular r. But then, when we are querying for a voucher2, we want to consider only vouchers that are distinct from voucher2.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: For each group (for each duration), we want to create a data structure that allows us to query: \n                - What is the minimal cost for a voucher in the group (excluding a particular voucher?) but we don't know which voucher to exclude.\n\n   However, note: we are iterating over all vouchers in group2 (or group1) and for each we query the entire group1 (or group2) for the condition. The condition is about the ending time, not about the identity.\n\n   But wait: two vouchers in the same group can have the same (l, r) but different costs? Actually, no: the problem does not say that the intervals are unique. So we might have multiple vouchers with the same (l, r) but different costs.\n\n   Therefore, we want to consider the minimal cost for a given ending time (or for an ending time less than a bound). \n\n   However, we cannot simply remove a voucher from the group because we are iterating over the entire group. \n\n   Alternative approach for the same group (d == x-d): \n\n        We can consider splitting the group into two copies? No, because we are not allowed to use the same voucher.\n\n        But note: we are iterating over all pairs. That would be O(n^2). We cannot do that.\n\n   We need to design an efficient solution.\n\n   Let me reframe: We are going to consider two types of pairs:\n\n        Type A: (v1, v2) with v1 from group1, v2 from group2, and we require r1 < l2.\n\n        Type B: (v2, v1) with v2 from group2, v1 from group1, and we require r2 < l1.\n\n   But note: Type A and Type B are the same as the two conditions. And for distinct groups (d != x-d) we can use two separate sets. Then we don't have the problem of using the same voucher.\n\n   For the same group (d == x-d), we are effectively looking for two distinct vouchers (v1 and v2) in the same set that satisfy either r1 < l2 OR r2 < l1.\n\n   How to handle same group?\n\n        We can treat the same group as two separate sets for the two queries, but then we must avoid matching a voucher with itself.\n\n        However, note: the condition for Type A: r1 < l2. For a fixed voucher, we cannot use the same voucher in both conditions. But the two queries are independent.\n\n        But we must not use the same voucher twice. \n\n        One idea: for the same group, we can run the two queries and then combine the results, but then subtract the cases where the same voucher is used? \n\n        Alternatively, we can preprocess the group to have two copies: one copy for the first voucher and one for the second, but then we must ensure that we don't match a voucher with itself. \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            For the same group, we can consider:\n\n                Query 1: For each voucher2 in the group, we want to find the minimal cost voucher1 in the group (excluding voucher2) that has r1 < l2.\n\n                Query 2: Similarly.\n\n        But how to exclude voucher2? \n\n        We can store the entire group and then for each voucher2, we remove it temporarily? That would be too slow.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute two arrays for the group:\n\n        Array1: sort the group by ending time (r)\n        Array2: sort the group by starting time (l)\n\n        Then, for Query 1 (for the same group) we want to consider all vouchers except the current one? \n\n        We can precompute for the entire group (without removal) the minimal cost for any voucher with ending <= some value, and then adjust by the fact that the current voucher might be included.\n\n        However, note: we are not required to use the minimal cost overall, but we are allowed to use any voucher from the group (except the current one). \n\n        We can do:\n\n            For the same group, we can create a separate data structure that ignores a particular voucher? Not easily.\n\n   Another idea: we can split the same group into two separate lists for the two queries and then combine, but that doesn't help.\n\n   Alternatively, we can process the same group by:\n\n        Condition: We want two distinct vouchers (v1, v2) from the same group (with durations d and d, and d+d=x) that do not overlap.\n\n        We can break the condition: either r1 < l2 or r2 < l1.\n\n        Then, we can consider:\n\n            Candidate 1: All pairs (v1, v2) such that r1 < l2.\n            Candidate 2: All pairs (v1, v2) such that r2 < l1.\n\n        Then the answer is the minimal cost among these candidates.\n\n        Now, how to compute Candidate 1 for the same group without iterating over all pairs?\n\n        We can sort the group by r (ending time). Then, for each voucher2, we want the minimal cost of a voucher1 (distinct from voucher2) that has r1 < l2.\n\n        But note: we are not excluding voucher2 by identity, but by the condition: we require r1 < l2. If there is a voucher1 (different from voucher2) that has r1 < l2, then we can use it.\n\n        However, what if the only voucher with r1 < l2 is voucher2 itself? Then we cannot use it because we need distinct.\n\n        So we must exclude voucher2.\n\n        Similarly, for Candidate 2: sort by l (starting time) and then for each voucher1, we want the minimal cost of a voucher2 (distinct from voucher1) that has r2 < l1.\n\n        To do this efficiently, we can:\n\n            For the same group, we want to quickly get the minimal cost for a voucher (other than a given one) that has ending time < a threshold (for Candidate 1) and similarly for starting time (for Candidate 2).\n\n        We can precompute:\n\n            For Candidate 1: \n                Let T = the entire group sorted by r (and then by cost?).\n                We want to build a structure that for a threshold t (which is l2) returns the minimal cost among all vouchers (in the entire group) with r < t, excluding possibly the current one.\n\n            But we don't know which one to exclude until we consider a particular voucher.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute an array `min_cost_by_r` for the group, but also keep the entire list.\n\n            Step 2: Then, for each voucher2, we look at the minimal cost among all vouchers (in the entire group) with r < l2. Then, if the minimal cost voucher is not voucher2, then we can use it. But if the minimal cost voucher is voucher2, then we look for the next best.\n\n        However, the minimal cost voucher might be voucher2, and then we have to look for the next minimal cost that is not voucher2.\n\n        We can precompute:\n\n            Sort the group by r (so that we can binary search for r < l2) and then by cost (to get minimal cost).\n\n            Then, we can store the minimal cost for each r, but then we want to exclude a particular voucher.\n\n        This becomes complicated.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the same-group issue by not grouping by duration at first, but by the two conditions independently.\n\n   However, note: the constraints are high (n, x up to 200000) and the durations are in [1, 200000] (because ri, li up to 200000, so duration d = ri-li+1 is at most 200000).\n\n   Given the complexity, perhaps we can do:\n\n        We will consider two types of pairs: \n            Type1: d1 = d, d2 = x-d, and d < x-d (so we only consider d <= x//2)\n            Type2: d1 = d, d2 = x-d, and d > x-d (then we consider d1 and d2 swapped)\n\n        But then we miss the case when d == x-d.\n\n        Actually, we can iterate d from 1 to (x-1)//2 and then also consider the symmetric part (if d != x-d) and then separately consider d = x-d if x is even.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require that d <= x-d. We can simply iterate d from 1 to x-1, but then we would consider each pair (d, x-d) twice (once for d and once for x-d) unless we enforce d <= x-d.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        Let ans = a big number.\n\n        Consider d from 1 to floor((x-1)/2) [so that d < x-d] and then if x is even, consider d = x//2 separately.\n\n        Then, for each d:\n\n            Let d1 = d, d2 = x - d.\n\n            Group1 = list of all vouchers with duration d1.\n            Group2 = list of all vouchers with duration d2.\n\n            Then, we do:\n\n                Candidate_A = minimal_total_cost(Group1, Group2, condition: r1 < l2)\n                Candidate_B = minimal_total_cost(Group2, Group1, condition: r2 < l1)   [note: here the roles are swapped]\n\n            Then, ans = min(ans, Candidate_A, Candidate_B)\n\n        If x is even, then d0 = x//2, then:\n\n            Group0 = list of all vouchers with duration d0.\n\n            Then, we need to find two distinct vouchers in Group0 that do not overlap.\n\n            We do:\n\n                Candidate_C = minimal_total_cost_for_same_group(Group0, condition: r1 < l2)   [using two distinct vouchers]\n                Candidate_D = minimal_total_cost_for_same_group(Group0, condition: r2 < l1)\n\n            Then, ans = min(ans, Candidate_C, Candidate_D)\n\n   Now, how to implement minimal_total_cost for two distinct groups (Group1 and Group2) for condition: r1 < l2?\n\n        We want to minimize cost1 + cost2 for (l1, r1, cost1) in Group1 and (l2, r2, cost2) in Group2 such that r1 < l2.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Precompute for Group1: \n                    We want to quickly get the minimal cost for any voucher in Group1 that ends before a given day L (which is l2).\n\n            We can do:\n\n                    Sort Group1 by r (the ending day). Then, we can also create an array of (r, cost) and then for each distinct ending day, we want the minimal cost for any voucher ending at that day or earlier.\n\n                    Actually, we can create an array `min_cost_by_r1` for Group1:\n\n                        Let events = []\n                        For each voucher (l, r, cost) in Group1:\n                            Append (r, cost)\n\n                        Then, sort by r, and then do a running minimum for cost.\n\n                    Then, for a given l2 (from Group2), we want the minimal cost in Group1 for any voucher with r < l2.\n\n                    But note: we are not requiring the voucher to be exactly ending before l2, but strictly less.\n\n            Step 2: For Group2, we iterate over each voucher (l2, r2, cost2) and query the minimal cost from Group1 for r < l2.\n\n            Then, candidate_A = min(candidate_A, min_cost_from_Group1 + cost2)\n\n            Similarly, for Candidate_B (condition: r2 < l1) we do:\n\n                    Sort Group2 by r (for the condition: r2 < l1, we need to query Group2 for r2 < l1, and then use the minimal cost from Group2 for that, and then combine with Group1's cost).\n\n                    But wait: condition for Candidate_B is: r2 < l1, so we want to minimize cost1 + cost2 for (l1, r1, cost1) in Group1 and (l2, r2, cost2) in Group2 such that r2 < l1.\n\n                    We can do:\n\n                        Precompute for Group2: an array `min_cost_by_r2` (minimal cost for any voucher in Group2 ending at r or below) and then for each voucher1 in Group1 (with start l1), we query Group2 for r2 < l1.\n\n            However, note: the two conditions are independent.\n\n   Implementation for minimal_total_cost(GroupA, GroupB, condition: rA < lB):\n\n        Let A = GroupA, B = GroupB.\n\n        Step 1: Precompute for GroupA (which will be the \"left\" group in the condition) the minimal cost for vouchers ending before a given day.\n\n                Sort A by the ending day (r). Then, we want an array `min_cost_A` such that for any day t, we know the minimal cost of a voucher in A that ends at a day <= t.\n\n                How:\n\n                    events = sorted(A, key=lambda x: x[1])   # each element is (l, r, cost); we sort by r\n                    Then, create an array `costs` = [cost for each event]\n                    Then, `min_cost_so_far` = [min(costs[0:i+1]) for i in range(len(events))]\n\n                    Then, we can do a binary search on events to find the maximal r that is < L (for a given l from B) and then take min_cost_so_far at that index.\n\n                But note: we want the minimal cost for any voucher in A with r < L.\n\n                Alternatively, we can compress the r values and use a Fenwick tree or segment tree, but n is up to 200000.\n\n                However, we can do:\n\n                    Let arr = sorted(set(r for (l, r, cost) in A))\n                    Then, we can do a prefix minimum array for the cost.\n\n                But note: we have to consider all vouchers. Actually, we can:\n\n                    Step 1a: Create a list of (r, cost) for A, then sort by r.\n                   ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct travel vouchers such that the sum of their durations equals exactly `x` days, and they do not overlap in time. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these two vouchers. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: We first group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to efficiently access all vouchers of a specific duration when needed.\n2. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each possible duration `d`, we check if there exists another duration `x - d` such that the sum of their durations equals `x`. \n3. **Non-overlapping Condition**: For each valid pair of durations `(d, x - d)`, we need to ensure that there exist two vouchers (one from each group) that do not overlap. This means either the first voucher ends before the second starts or vice versa.\n4. **Efficient Query Handling**: To efficiently find the minimal cost pairs that meet the non-overlapping condition, we preprocess each group of vouchers by sorting them and maintaining prefix minima for costs. This allows us to quickly query the minimal cost voucher ending before a specific day (for one group) and combine it with the minimal cost voucher starting after a specific day (from the other group).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    if not data:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n        \n    n = int(data[0])\n    x = int(data[1])\n    intervals = []\n    index = 2\n    for i in range(n):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index+1])\n        cost_val = int(data[index+2])\n        index += 3\n        intervals.append((l, r, cost_val))\n        \n    max_day = 200000\n    groups = [[] for _ in range(max_day+1)]\n    \n    for (l, r, cost_val) in intervals:\n        d = r -

start day + 1) into an array where each index corresponds to a duration.\n3. **Checking Valid Pairs**: For each duration `d` from 1 to `x//2`, we check if there exists a complementary duration `x - d`. If such a duration exists, we proceed to find the minimal cost pair of vouchers from the two groups that do not overlap.\n4. **Non-overlapping Check**: For each voucher in one group, we use binary search on the other group's sorted list (by start or end day) to find the minimal cost voucher that does not overlap. Prefix minima arrays are used to quickly determine the minimal cost for valid non-overlapping pairs.\n5. **Special Case Handling**: If `x` is even, we handle the case where both vouchers have the same duration by ensuring they are distinct and non-overlapping.\n6. **Output Result**: The minimal total cost found is printed, or -1 if no valid pair exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using grouping and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
