The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge, and has width 1 cell.\n\n The i-th ring is defined on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)), but note that the ring is the border of that inner rectangle.\n\n However, note that the problem states: \n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i - 1)) × (h - 4(i - 1))\"\n\n But wait: when we remove the outer layers, the first ring is the border of the entire w x h. Then the second ring is the border of the inner rectangle which is 2 cells in from each edge, so the inner rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) x (h-4). \n\n How many cells does the i-th ring have?\n For a rectangle of size a x b, the border (ring) consists of:\n   top and bottom: 2 * b\n   left and right: 2 * (a - 2)   [because the corners are already counted in top and bottom]\n\n So total for one ring: 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*(b + a - 2) = 2*(a+b-2)\n\n However, note that the example: \n   Input: '3 3 1' -> Output: 8\n   Let's compute for the first ring: \n        a = 3, b = 3 -> 2*(3+3-2) = 2*(4) = 8. Correct.\n\n   Next example: '7 9 1' -> Output: 28\n        a=7, b=9 -> 2*(7+9-2)=2*(14)=28. Correct.\n\n   Next example: '7 9 2' -> Output: 40\n        First ring: 28 as above.\n        Second ring: \n            The inner rectangle for the second ring is (7-4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and (9-4*(2-1))=5.\n            Then the second ring: 2*(3+5-2)=2*(6)=12.\n            Total: 28+12=40. Correct.\n\n But note: the problem says k can be at most floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). So we don't have to worry about negative or invalid k.\n\n Steps:\n   Read w, h, k.\n   For each ring i from 1 to k:\n        Let a_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n        Let b_i = h - 4*(i-1)\n        The number of cells in the i-th ring is: 2*(a_i + b_i - 2)\n\n   Then sum the rings from i=1 to k.\n\n However, note: if after subtracting 4*(i-1) from w or h, the dimensions become too small? \n   But the problem states k is at most floor((min(n, m)+1)/4), meaning that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 1x1 (actually, the smallest dimension must be at least 1, but note: when we do the ring, the formula requires that the inner rectangle has positive dimensions? Actually, the condition ensures that the k-th ring's inner rectangle has at least 1x1, but note that the ring itself is the border, so we require the inner rectangle to have at least 2x2 to form a border? \n\n Let me check: \n   Condition: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4)\n   Example: w=3, h=3 -> min=3, floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1 -> k=1 is allowed.\n\n   In the first ring: a_1 = 3, b_1=3 -> valid.\n\n   But if k=2 for w=3, h=3: then a_2 = 3-4*(1)= -1 -> which is invalid. However, the condition ensures we don't have k beyond the limit, so we are safe.\n\n Therefore, we can simply iterate from i=1 to k and compute the ring.\n\n But note: the problem says the plate is split into w x h cells. The rings are defined for the first k rings. And k is chosen such that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is non-negative (but note: the condition is given",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells that need to be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding multiple concentric rings. The first ring is placed along the edge of the plate, and each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells away from the previous one, with each ring having a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the number of cells in each concentric ring around a rectangular plate. The key observation is that each ring corresponds to the border of an inner rectangle formed by reducing the original dimensions by 4 cells for each subsequent ring (since each ring moves 2 cells inward from the previous one, affecting both dimensions by 4 cells in total).\n2. **Insight**: For each ring, the number of cells can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle adjusted for overlapping corners. Specifically, the number of cells in the i-th ring is given by \\(2 \\times (a_i + b_i - 2)\\), where \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are the dimensions of the inner rectangle after accounting for the previous rings.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves iterating from 1 to k (the number of rings), computing the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each ring, and summing the cells required for each ring.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(k) time, which is efficient given the constraints (k is at most 50 since the minimum dimension is up to 100).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    w, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n        a = w - 4 * (i-1)\n        b = h - 4 * (i-1)\n        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:\n            break\n        total += 2 * (a + b - 2)\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: the width (w), height (h), and number of rings (k) of the plate.\n2. **Initialization**: A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total number of cells to be gilded.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k:\n   - Calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle (`a` and `b`) by subtracting \\(4 \\times (i-1)\\) from the original width and height.\n   - If either dimension becomes non-positive, break the loop as further rings would not contribute any cells.\n   - Compute the number of cells in the current ring using the formula \\(2 \\times (a + b - 2)\\) and add it to `total`.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the required cells by leveraging geometric properties of rectangles and ensures correctness by adhering to the problem constraints.",
