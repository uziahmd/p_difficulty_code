Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n  1. The two diagonals must have the same letter (say, 'X').\n  2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter (say, '.') and that letter is different from the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the example input includes:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox   -> Output \"NO\"\n\n   Why? Because in the third row (index 2, which is the middle) the third character (index 2) is 's' but it is on the diagonal? \n        Actually, the middle row and column: the center element is at (2,2) (0-indexed). But note: the condition says that non-diagonal must be the same and different from the diagonal.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n  Diagonals: \n      Main diagonal: (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n      Anti-diagonal: (i, n-1-i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n  Steps:\n  1. Check all the diagonal elements: they must be the same. Let that letter be `d`.\n  2. Check all the non-diagonal elements: they must be the same and not equal to `d`. Let that letter be `e`.\n\n However, note: the example input 2:\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n  Here, the diagonals: \n        (0,0): 'w', (1,1): 's', (2,2): 'w' -> Not the same! But wait, the example output is \"YES\".\n\n  Wait, let me re-read the problem statement: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n  But in the example, the main diagonal is ['w','s','w'] -> not all same. So why \"YES\"?\n\n  Let me check the example again: \n      Input: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      The two diagonals are:\n          Main diagonal: [0][0] = 'w', [1][1] = 's', [2][2] = 'w'\n          Anti-diagonal: [0][2] = 'w', [1][1] = 's', [2][0] = 'w'\n\n  The problem states: \"on both diagonals\" meaning each diagonal individually must have the same letter.\n\n  But in the main diagonal we have 'w','s','w' -> not same. Similarly anti-diagonal: 'w','s','w'. \n\n  However, note: the example output is \"YES\". \n\n  This implies I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again: \n      \"if: on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\n  But wait: the example has two diagonals. Each diagonal must have the same letter. In the example, the main diagonal has two different letters? \n\n  Alternatively, perhaps the problem means that the entire main diagonal is composed of one letter and the entire anti-diagonal is composed of one letter, but these two letters can be different? \n\n  But then the example: \n        Main diagonal: ['w','s','w'] -> not the same. So that would fail.\n\n  Let me check the example provided in the sample input and output:\n\n      Example 1: \n          Input: \n              5\n              xooox\n              oxoxo\n              soxoo\n              oxoxo\n              xooox\n          Output: \"NO\"\n\n      Example 2: \n          Input: \n              3\n              wsw\n              sws\n              wsw\n          Output: \"YES\"\n\n      Example 3: \n          Input: \n              3\n              xpx\n              pxp\n              xpe\n          Output: \"NO\"\n\n  After reading the problem again, note: the example input 2 is 3x3 with three rows: \"wsw\", \"sws\", \"wsw\".\n\n  Actually, the diagonals in a 3x3 are:\n      Main diagonal: [0][0], [1][1], [2][2] -> 'w','s','w' -> not the same? Then how is it \"YES\"?\n\n  But wait, the problem says: \"on both diagonals\" meaning the two diagonals. And the two diagonals must be the same letter? Or each diagonal individually?\n\n  The problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n  This could be interpreted as: the entire main diagonal has one letter and the entire anti-diagonal has one letter. It does not say that the two diagonals must have the same letter.\n\n  However, note the example 2: \n        Main diagonal: ['w','s','w'] -> not same. But wait, wait, wait, let me check the example 2 again.\n\n  The example 2 input is:\n\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n  The main diagonal: \n        row0: index0 -> 'w'\n        row1: index1 -> 's'\n        row2: index2 -> 'w'\n\n  So the main diagonal has two distinct letters. Similarly, anti-diagonal: \n        row0: index2 -> 'w'\n        row1: index1 -> 's'\n        row2: index0 -> 'w'\n\n  So both diagonals do not have all the same letter.\n\n  But the expected output is \"YES\". \n\n  There must be a misunderstanding.\n\n  Let me look at the example 2 again. The example says:\n\n        Input: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\n\n  And the example output is \"YES\".\n\n  Another possibility: the problem actually requires that the two diagonals have the same letter, and that letter is the center (which is common to both diagonals). So in a 3x3, the center is part of both diagonals. Therefore, the entire main diagonal must be the same as the entire anti-diagonal, but they share the center. \n\n  However, the example 2 has center 's'. Then the main diagonal should be all 's'? But it's not: it has 'w' and 's'. Similarly the anti-diagonal has 'w' and 's'.\n\n  Alternatively, maybe the problem allows that the diagonals are the same only if we consider the common center as shared, but the rest of the diagonal must be the same as the center? \n\n  Let me read the problem statement more carefully: \n      \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n  This means that for the main diagonal, every letter must be the same. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. \n\n  Then example 2 fails because the main diagonal has 'w' and 's'. \n\n  But the example output is \"YES\", so there must be an error in the problem statement interpretation.\n\n  Let me check the example 2 by hand: \n      The example 2 is:\n\n          w s w\n          s s s   ??? Wait, no, the second row is \"sws\", so the center is 's'. \n\n      The diagonals:\n          Main diagonal: [0][0]='w', [1][1]='s', [2][2]='w' -> not uniform.\n          Anti-diagonal: [0][2]='w', [1][1]='s', [2][0]='w' -> not uniform.\n\n  How can this be \"YES\"?\n\n  Wait, perhaps the problem does not require the entire diagonal to be the same, but only the center? \n\n  But the problem says \"all letters are the same\" on the diagonals.\n\n  Alternatively, I see now: the example input 2 is:\n\n        3\n        wsw\n        sws\n        wsw\n\n  The diagonals are defined as the set of cells (i, i) and (i, n-1-i). \n\n  Now, note that the problem says: the two diagonals must have the same letter. \n\n  But here, the main diagonal has two different letters: 'w' and 's'. The anti-diagonal also has two different letters. \n\n  However, the example output is \"YES\". \n\n  After checking the example 2 in the problem statement: \n      Input: \n          3\n          wsw\n          sws\n          wsw\n\n      Output: \"YES\"\n\n  I suspect that the problem intended to say that the two diagonals (as sets) must have the same letter, but note that the center is common. \n\n  But the example 2: \n        The main diagonal: { 'w', 's' } -> two letters, and the anti-diagonal: { 'w', 's' } -> two letters.\n\n  Another possibility: the problem requires that the two diagonals (as two separate lines) are composed of the same letter? \n\n  But in example 2, the main diagonal is not composed of one letter, and the anti-diagonal is not composed of one letter.\n\n  Alternatively, maybe the problem has a different definition of diagonals. \n\n  Let me consider the example 2: \n        w . w\n        . . .\n        w . w\n\n  But wait, the example 2 is:\n\n        w s w\n        s s s   -> Wait, no, the input is \"sws\", so second row is s, w, s? No, wait: the second row is \"sws\", meaning: \n            row0: 'w','s','w'\n            row1: 's','w','s'   -> wait, no, the example input says:\n\n                3\n                wsw\n                sws\n                wsw\n\n            So row1 is \"sws\": so the center is the second character of the second row? \n\n            Actually, the grid is:\n\n                row0: ['w','s','w']\n                row1: ['s','w','s']   ? \n\n            But wait, the example input is:\n\n                wsw\n                sws\n                wsw\n\n            So row0: \"wsw\" -> ['w','s','w']\n            row1: \"sws\" -> ['s','w','s']\n            row2: \"wsw\" -> ['w','s','w']\n\n            Now, the main diagonal: \n                (0,0): 'w'\n                (1,1): 'w'   (from row1, the middle element is 'w')\n                (2,2): 'w'\n\n            The anti-diagonal:\n                (0,2): 'w'\n                (1,1): 'w'\n                (2,0): 'w'\n\n            So both diagonals are all 'w'. \n\n            And the non-diagonal elements: \n                The four corners (excluding the diagonals) are:\n                    (0,1): 's'\n                    (1,0): 's'\n                    (1,2): 's'\n                    (2,1): 's'\n\n            So they are all 's', and 's' != 'w'. \n\n            Therefore, the example 2 is indeed an X.\n\n  Why did I think the center was 's'? Because in the second row, the string is \"sws\", so the center of the second row is the second character, which is 'w'. \n\n  Correction: \n      The grid is:\n\n          row0: \"wsw\" -> [0][0]='w', [0][1]='s', [0][2]='w'\n          row1: \"sws\" -> [1][0]='s', [1][1]='w', [1][2]='s'\n          row2: \"wsw\" -> [2][0]='w', [2][1]='s', [2][2]='w'\n\n      Now, the main diagonal: \n          [0][0] = 'w'\n          [1][1] = 'w'\n          [2][2] = 'w'\n\n      The anti-diagonal:\n          [0][2] = 'w'\n          [1][1] = 'w'\n          [2][0] = 'w'\n\n      So both diagonals are 'w'. \n\n      The non-diagonal positions: \n          (0,1): 's', (0,2) is diagonal -> skip\n          (1,0): 's', (1,2): 's'\n          (2,1): 's'\n\n      They are all 's', which is different from 'w'. \n\n  So the example 2 is \"YES\".\n\n  The mistake was in my initial parsing of the second row: I thought the second row was \"sws\" meaning ['s','w','s'], but then the center of the second row (which is the middle) is the second element (index1) which is 'w'. \n\n  Therefore, the correct algorithm:\n\n  Step 1: Read n and the grid.\n\n  Step 2: Define two sets (or just two variables) for the diagonal letter and the non-diagonal letter.\n\n  However, note: the two diagonals must be the same letter? Actually, they are both 'w' in example 2. \n\n  But wait: what if the two diagonals have two different letters? The problem says \"both diagonals\" must have the same letter? \n\n  Let me read: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\n  This does not necessarily mean that the two diagonals must have the same letter. It means that the main diagonal has one letter and the anti-diagonal has one letter, and that one letter for the main diagonal might be different from the one for the anti-diagonal? \n\n  But wait, the example 2: both diagonals are 'w'. \n\n  Now, consider a hypothetical example:\n\n        a b c\n        d e f\n        g h i\n\n      Main diagonal: a, e, i -> must be same, say 'x'\n      Anti-diagonal: c, e, g -> must be same, say 'y'\n\n  Then the center e must be both 'x' and 'y'. So if the main diagonal is 'x' and the anti-diagonal is 'y', then we must have x == y because the center is common.\n\n  Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter (the center is common). \n\n  So the condition is: the entire main diagonal must be the same letter, the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter, and these two letters must be the same (because the center is included in both). \n\n  However, note: the center is the same cell, so if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'y', then the center must be 'x' and also 'y', so x==y.\n\n  So the two diagonals must be the same letter.\n\n  Now, example 1:\n\n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox\n\n      Main diagonal: \n          (0,0): 'x'\n          (1,1): 'o'\n          (2,2): 'x'\n          (3,3): 'o'\n          (4,4): 'x'\n\n      So the main diagonal is not the same letter (has 'x' and 'o').\n\n      Therefore, condition fails -> \"NO\", which matches.\n\n  Example 3:\n\n        3\n        xpx\n        pxp\n        xpe\n\n      Main diagonal: \n          (0,0): 'x'\n          (1,1): 'p'\n          (2,2): 'e'\n\n      Already, the main diagonal has three different letters. So condition fails.\n\n  But wait, the example output is \"NO\", so that's correct.\n\n  However, note: the example 3 has the center as 'p'. The anti-diagonal: \n          (0,2): 'x'\n          (1,1): 'p'\n          (2,0): 'x'\n\n      So anti-diagonal has 'x' and 'p', which is not uniform.\n\n  So the condition fails.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n  1. Read n.\n  2. Read grid (list of strings)\n\n  3. Check the main diagonal and anti-diagonal for being uniform and the same letter.\n\n  4. Check that the non-diagonal elements are all the same and different from the diagonal letter.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  a) Traverse the main diagonal (i from 0 to n-1) and collect the letter at (i,i). Also, traverse the anti-diagonal (i from 0 to n-1) and collect the letter at (i, n-1-i).\n\n  But note: the center element (if n>=3) is included in both. \n\n  Conditions for diagonals:\n      - The main diagonal must have the same letter (say `d1`) for all its elements.\n      - The anti-diagonal must have the same letter (say `d2`) for all its elements.\n\n  Since the center is common, we must have d1 == d2.\n\n  Alternatively, we can combine: all the diagonal elements (both diagonals) must be the same? \n\n  Actually, the two diagonals together form a set of points. The entire set of diagonal points (including both) must be the same letter? \n\n  But note: the problem says \"on both diagonals\", meaning each diagonal individually. However, the center is common. \n\n  Since the two diagonals must individually be uniform, and the center is common, then the entire diagonal set must be the same letter. \n\n  So we can do:\n\n      Let d = the letter at (0,0) for the main diagonal, and the letter at (0, n-1) for the anti-diagonal. But wait, the entire main diagonal must be d, and the entire anti-diagonal must be the same d.\n\n  Alternatively, we can check:\n\n      For i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][i] != d: then break (for main diagonal)\n          if grid[i][n-1-i] != d: then break (for anti-diagonal)\n\n  But note: we don't know d. We can set d to the center? Actually, we can set d to the value at (0,0) and then check the entire main diagonal and the entire anti-diagonal against d? \n\n  However, the center is the same in both, so we can use the center as reference? \n\n  Alternatively, we can check the entire set of diagonal elements (main and anti) must be the same letter. But note: the problem requires each diagonal individually. \n\n  But since the center is common, if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then the entire diagonal set must be the same letter (because the center is fixed). \n\n  So we can do:\n\n      d = grid[0][0]   # but wait, the anti-diagonal starts at (0, n-1). What if the main diagonal is uniform but the anti-diagonal is uniform and they are different? \n\n      Example: \n          3x3:\n          a b c\n          d e f\n          g h i\n\n          Condition: main diagonal: a, e, i must be same -> say 'x'\n          Condition: anti-diagonal: c, e, g must be same -> say 'y'\n\n          Then e must be both 'x' and 'y'. So if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then they must be the same.\n\n  So we can check:\n\n      Let d = grid[0][0]  (but wait, what if the main diagonal doesn't start with grid[0][0]? Actually, the entire main diagonal must be the same, so we can set d to grid[0][0] and then check the entire main diagonal. Similarly, we can set d2 to grid[0][n-1] and check the anti-diagonal. Then compare d and d2.\n\n  But note: the main diagonal: \n        grid[0][0] = d, grid[1][1] must be d, grid[2][2] must be d, ... \n      The anti-diagonal: \n        grid[0][n-1] must be d, grid[1][n-2] must be d, ... \n\n  However, the center is grid[n//2][n//2] and must be d for the main diagonal, and also for the anti-diagonal.\n\n  Alternatively, we can check the entire set of diagonal elements (both diagonals) must be the same. Since the center is included twice, we can simply check that for every cell (i, j) that lies on either diagonal, the letter is the same. \n\n  But the problem says \"on both diagonals\", meaning each separately. However, the condition that each diagonal is uniform and they share the center forces them to be the same.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      Step 1: Check the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform.\n\n      Step 2: Check that the two diagonals have the same letter (by comparing the main diagonal's letter with the anti-diagonal's letter, or simply the center must be the same for both).\n\n  However, we can combine:\n\n      Let d1 = None\n      For i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n              d1 = grid[0][0]  # we don't need to set, but we can break and then check the anti-diagonal?\n          Actually, we can set d = grid[0][0] and then check the entire main diagonal is d.\n\n      Similarly, set d_anti = grid[0][n-1] and then check the entire anti-diagonal is d_anti.\n\n      Then we require d == d_anti.\n\n  But wait, what if the main diagonal is uniform but not starting with grid[0][0]? Actually, if the main diagonal is uniform, then all its elements are the same. So we can take any element, say the first one.\n\n  However, what if grid[0][0] is not the same as grid[0][n-1]? Then we already know the two diagonals are different.\n\n  Example:\n\n        3x3:\n        x . x\n        . y .\n        x . x\n\n        If the main diagonal is 'x' (so grid[0][0]=='x', grid[1][1]=='x', grid[2][2]=='x') and the anti-diagonal is 'x' (grid[0][2]=='x', grid[1][1]=='x', grid[2][0]=='x'), then d = grid[0][0] is 'x' and d_anti = grid[0][2] is 'x', so they are the same.\n\n  But consider:\n\n        Main diagonal: 'x', anti-diagonal: 'y'\n\n        Then grid[0][0] = 'x', grid[0][n-1] = 'y'. Then we check the main diagonal: all are 'x'. Then check the anti-diagonal: all are 'y'. Then we require that 'x' == 'y'. If not, then condition fails.\n\n  So:\n\n      Step 1: Check main diagonal is uniform (all same letter) and store that letter as d_main.\n      Step 2: Check anti-diagonal is uniform and store that letter as d_anti.\n      Step 3: If d_main != d_anti, then print \"NO\".\n\n  But note: the center is part of both, so if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then the center must be the same in both. Therefore, if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then the two letters must be the same. \n\n  Why? Because the center is included in both. So if the main diagonal is uniform (say letter A) and the anti-diagonal is uniform (say letter B), then the center must be A and also B, so A==B.\n\n  Therefore, we can skip step 3 if we have already checked the center is the same in both? Actually, the center is the same cell, so we can check the center separately.\n\n  Alternatively, we can check:\n\n      For the main diagonal: \n          for i in range(n):\n              if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n                  d_main_fail = True\n\n      For the anti-diagonal:\n          for i in range(n):\n              if grid[i][n-1-i] != grid[0][n-1]:\n                  d_anti_fail = True\n\n      Then if d_main_fail or d_anti_fail: then \"NO\"\n\n      But wait, what if the main diagonal is uniform but not with grid[0][0]? Actually, if the main diagonal is uniform, then we can use grid[0][0] as the representative. Similarly for anti-diagonal.\n\n  However, what if the main diagonal is uniform but the first element is not the same as the center? Actually, the entire diagonal is uniform, so if the main diagonal is uniform, then grid[i][i] is the same for all i, so we can use any element.\n\n  So better:\n\n      Let d = None\n      for i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n              d = grid[0][0]   # we don't need to set, we can break and then set d as grid[0][0] and then check the entire main diagonal?\n      Actually, we can do:\n\n      d_main = grid[0][0]\n      for i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][i] != d_main:\n              d_main = None\n              break\n\n      Similarly, d_anti = grid[0][n-1]\n      for i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][n-1-i] != d_anti:\n              d_anti = None\n              break\n\n      Then if d_main is None or d_anti is None -> \"NO\"\n      Then, we have two letters: d_main and d_anti. But note: the center is (n//2, n//2) and must be the same in both. \n\n      However, we already know that the center is part of the main diagonal (so if d_main is set, then grid[n//2][n//2] is d_main) and part of the anti-diagonal (so if d_anti is set, then grid[n//2][n//2] is d_anti). Therefore, d_main must equal d_anti.\n\n      So we can check: if d_main != d_anti -> \"NO\"\n\n  But wait, we set d_main = grid[0][0] and d_anti = grid[0][n-1]. What if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, but grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1]? Then the center must be both d_main and d_anti, so they must be equal. \n\n  Example: \n        Main diagonal: all 'a', anti-diagonal: all 'b', and the center is the same cell? Then the center must be 'a' and 'b', so a==b.\n\n  Therefore, if the two diagonals are uniform, then the center being the same in both forces d_main == d_anti.\n\n  But note: we are using grid[0][0] for d_main and grid[0][n-1] for d_anti. The center is grid[n//2][n//2]. \n\n  How do we know the entire main diagonal is uniform? We checked with grid[0][0]. Similarly for anti-diagonal with grid[0][n-1]. \n\n  However, the center must be the same as grid[0][0] (because main diagonal) and the same as grid[0][n-1] (because anti-diagonal). Therefore, grid[0][0] must equal grid[0][n-1]. \n\n  So we can also check: if grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1], then the two diagonals cannot be the same because the center is grid[0][0] (from main diagonal) and grid[0][n-1] (from anti-diagonal) and they are different.\n\n  But wait, the center is not grid[0][0] nor grid[0][n-1] unless n=1. \n\n  Actually, the center is (n//2, n//2). \n\n  So we must check the entire main diagonal is uniform (using grid[0][0]) and the entire anti-diagonal is uniform (using grid[0][n-1]). Then the center must be grid[0][0] (from main) and grid[0][n-1] (from anti). Therefore, we require grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1].\n\n  However, what if the main diagonal is uniform but the anti-diagonal is uniform and grid[0][0] != grid[0][n-1]? Then the center is forced to be two different letters, which is impossible.\n\n  Therefore, we can break the check into:\n\n      Step 1: Check that the main diagonal is uniform (all same letter) by checking grid[i][i] == grid[0][0] for all i. If not, \"NO\".\n      Step 2: Check that the anti-diagonal is uniform (all same letter) by checking grid[i][n-1-i] == grid[0][n-1] for all i. If not, \"NO\".\n      Step 3: Check that grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1] (because the center is common and must be the same). If not, \"NO\".\n\n  But wait, step 3 is redundant because the center is included in both diagonals. Actually, if the main diagonal is uniform and the anti-diagonal is uniform, then the center must be the same in both, so the entire diagonal set must be the same letter. \n\n  However, note: the entire main diagonal is uniform and the entire anti-diagonal is uniform, but they might be two different letters? \n\n  Example: \n        n=3\n        a b c\n        d e f\n        g h i\n\n        Main diagonal: a, e, i -> uniform: so a=e=i.\n        Anti-diagonal: c, e, g -> uniform: so c=e=g.\n\n        Then we have a=e=i and c=e=g, so a=c=g=i=e -> so the entire diagonal set is the same letter.\n\n  Therefore, the two diagonals must be the same letter. \n\n  So we can simply:\n\n      Step 1: Check the main diagonal is uniform (all same) and store that letter as d.\n      Step 2: Check the anti-diagonal is uniform (all same) and store that letter as d.\n      But wait, we can use the same letter for both? \n\n  Alternatively, we can check that all the diagonal elements (both diagonals) are the same letter. \n\n  Steps:\n\n      Let d = grid[0][0]\n      For i in range(n):\n          # Check main diagonal: (i,i)\n          if grid[i][i] != d:\n              d = None\n              break\n      If d is None: then NO (for main diagonal)\n      Else, set d = grid[0][0] (we have the correct d) and then check anti-diagonal:\n\n      For i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n              d = None\n              break\n\n      Then if d is None: NO, else YES? \n\n  But wait, the anti-diagonal must be uniform and equal to d (the main diagonal letter). \n\n  However, what if the main diagonal is uniform with letter d, but the anti-diagonal is uniform with letter e (different) and the center is d (from main) and e (from anti) -> conflict. \n\n  But note: the center is (n//2, n//2) and must be d (from main) and also must be e (from anti). So d must equal e.\n\n  Therefore, we can check the anti-diagonal against the main diagonal's letter d.\n\n  So:\n\n      Step 1: Check main diagonal is uniform (all same) and record that letter as d.\n      Step 2: Check anti-diagonal is uniform and that the letter is d.\n\n      But wait, the anti-diagonal might be uniform but with a different letter? Then we break.\n\n  Alternatively, we can check the entire diagonal set (both diagonals) is the same letter.\n\n  But note: the problem requires each diagonal individually. \n\n  However, the above two steps are sufficient.\n\n  Now, after the diagonals are checked, we need to check the non-diagonal elements.\n\n  Step 4: Check that all non-diagonal elements are the same letter, say `e`, and `e` != `d`.\n\n  How to check non-diagonal?\n\n      We need to traverse all cells (i,j) that are not on the main diagonal and not on the anti-diagonal.\n\n      Conditions for a cell (i,j) to be non-diagonal:\n          (i == j) or (i+j == n-1) -> then it's diagonal (either main or anti).\n\n      So we want to check that for every cell (i,j) that is not (i==j or i+j==n-1), the letter is the same, and that letter is different from d.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"all other squares\" (non-diagonals) contain the same letter and that letter is different.\n\n  We can:\n\n      Let e = None\n      For i in range(n):\n          for j in range(n):\n              if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                  continue\n              if e is None:\n                  e = grid[i][j]\n              else:\n                  if grid[i][j] != e:\n                      e = None\n                      break\n          if e is None:\n              break\n\n      Then if e is None -> \"NO\", else if e != d -> \"YES\", else \"NO\"? \n\n  But wait, what if the non-diagonal elements are not the same? Then we set e to None and break. Then we output \"NO\".\n\n  However, we must also ensure that the non-diagonal letter is different from d.\n\n  So:\n\n      If the diagonals are good (step1 and step2) and the non-diagonals are good (same letter and that letter != d), then \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n  But note: the non-diagonal check must be done only after the diagonals are verified? \n\n  However, if the diagonals are not uniform, we already output \"NO\". \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      Step 1: Check main diagonal is uniform -> if not, print \"NO\" and exit.\n      Step 2: Check anti-diagonal is uniform and the same as the main diagonal's letter -> if not, print \"NO\" and exit.\n      Step 3: Check non-diagonal elements are all the same and that same letter is different from the diagonal letter.\n\n  But wait: what if the non-diagonal elements are not the same? Then we output \"NO\".\n\n  However, note: the problem does not require that the non-diagonal letter is the same as the diagonal letter? It says: \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals\".\n\n  So:\n\n      Step 1: Check main diagonal is uniform (all same) and anti-diagonal is uniform and same letter (d).\n      Step 2: Check non-diagonal elements: \n          - They are all the same (say e)\n          - e != d\n\n      If both conditions hold, \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n  But note: what if the non-diagonal elements are not the same? Then we output \"NO\".\n\n  However, there is an edge: what if the grid has no non-diagonal elements? But n>=3 and odd, so there are non-diagonal elements.\n\n  Example: n=3, there are 9-6=3 non-diagonal elements? Actually, the two diagonals together have 3+3-1=5 elements (since center is shared). So non-diagonal: 9-5=4.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      grid = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          grid.append(input().strip())\n\n      # Step 1: Check main diagonal is uniform.\n      d = grid[0][0]\n      for i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][i] != d:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n      # Step 2: Check anti-diagonal is uniform and same letter d.\n      for i in range(n):\n          if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              exit(0)\n\n      # Step 3: Check non-diagonal elements.\n      # We'll collect the non-diagonal letter.

    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (non-diagonal elements) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Main Diagonal Uniformity**: The main diagonal consists of elements where the row index equals the column index (i.e., `(i, i)` for each `i`). All elements in this diagonal must be identical.\n2. **Check Anti-Diagonal Uniformity**: The anti-diagonal consists of elements where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1` (i.e., `(i, n-1-i)` for each `i`). All elements in this diagonal must also be identical and the same as those on the main diagonal.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: All elements not on either diagonal must be identical and different from the diagonal elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input().strip())\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    grid.append(input().strip())\n\nd = grid[0][0]\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][n-1-i] != d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit(0)\n\ne = None\nfound = False\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        if not found:\n            e = grid[i][j]\n            found = True\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != e:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit(0)\n\nif not found:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if e == d:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check**: The first loop checks if all elements on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are the same. If any element differs, it immediately prints \"NO\" and exits.\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: The second loop checks if all elements on the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same as those on the main diagonal. Again, if any element differs, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n4. **Non-Diagonal Elements Check**: The third loop scans all elements not on either diagonal. It checks if all these elements are identical and different from the diagonal elements. If any non-diagonal element differs or is the same as the diagonal elements, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n5. **Final Check**: If all checks pass, it prints \"YES\", confirming the grid forms an \"X\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies all conditions required to determine if the grid forms an \"X\" by leveraging systematic checks for uniformity and equality across specified elements.",
