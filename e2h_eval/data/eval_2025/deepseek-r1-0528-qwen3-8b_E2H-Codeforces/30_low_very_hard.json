Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (1 <= n <= 18) and a string A of exactly 2n digits.\n We have two players, Homer (H) and Marge (M). Each makes exactly n moves.\n In each move, the current player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their own number.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"On its turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A.\"\n\n But wait: there is a catch. The problem does not specify who starts. However, note that the output example for input \"2\\n1234\" is \"HHMM\", meaning the first two moves are by Homer and then two by Marge? Actually, the example input \"2\\n9911\" gives \"HMHM\". \n\n But note: the problem says \"They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize.\"\n\n What is the total prize? It's the sum of the two numbers (interpreted as integers) S1 and S2.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.\" and then we are to maximize the total prize (which is S1 + S2).\n\n How do we assign moves to the two players? We can choose the order (who goes first, second, etc.) arbitrarily, but the entire sequence must be of length 2n (each player n moves). And we must assign the digits in the order they appear (from left to right) to either Homer or Marge.\n\n But note: the process is fixed: at each step, the leftmost digit is taken and appended to the current player's number. However, the assignment of which player is taking the digit is under our control (we can decide the sequence of H and M as long as each appears n times). But the digit is always taken from the front.\n\n So the entire sequence is determined by the order of H and M: the first n moves (in the sequence) will take the first n digits (but not necessarily consecutively because we are interleaving) and the second n moves will take the next n digits? Actually, no: the entire A is 2n digits. The moves are in the order of the sequence (which is a string of n 'H' and n 'M'). Then:\n\n For move i (0-indexed) in the sequence:\n   Let d_i be the digit at the beginning of the current A (which initially is the i-th digit of the original A).\n   Then if the i-th character in the sequence is 'H', we take d_i and put it at the front of Homer's number (so effectively, the number grows from left to right? Actually, note: when we append the digit to the number, the digit becomes the least significant digit? But wait, the problem says \"append\", so if we have an empty string and we append '1' then '2', we get \"12\", not \"21\".\n\n However, note: the process is: \n   Initially: A = \"1234\", S1 = \"\", S2 = \"\"\n   If the first move is by Homer (H): then Homer's number becomes \"1\", and A becomes \"234\".\n   Then the next move (say M): then Marge's number becomes \"2\", and A becomes \"34\".\n   Then H: Homer's number becomes \"13\", and A becomes \"4\".\n   Then M: Marge's number becomes \"24\", and A becomes \"\".\n\n But wait, that doesn't match the example output \"HHMM\" for input \"2\\n1234\". Actually, the example output is just a string of moves.\n\n However, the problem says: \"output the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge\"\n\n So we are to output a string of length 2n with n H's and n M's, and the digits of A are assigned to the players in the order of the sequence (the first digit to the first player in the sequence, the second digit to the second player, and so on).\n\n But note: the example input \"2\\n9911\" gives output \"HMHM\". \n\n How does that work?\n   Sequence: H -> M -> H -> M\n   Step0: Take first digit '9' for Homer -> S1 = \"9\", A becomes \"911\"\n   Step1: Take next digit '9' for Marge -> S2 = \"9\", A becomes \"11\"\n   Step2: Take next digit '1' for Homer -> S1 =",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns picking digits from a given 2n-digit number. The total prize is the sum of the two numbers formed by each player's digits. The challenge is to determine the optimal sequence of moves (alternating between 'H' and 'M') such that each player picks exactly n digits, and the sum of their numbers is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires interleaving the digits of the given number into two sequences (one for each player) such that the sum of the two resulting numbers is maximized. Each player must pick exactly n digits, and the digits are taken from the left end of the remaining number in each turn.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal strategy involves making decisions at each step based on which digit (from the remaining number) contributes more to the total sum when assigned to a particular player. Specifically, if the current digit is greater than the next digit, it should be assigned to the player who can benefit more from its value (either Homer or Marge). Conversely, if the current digit is smaller, it should be assigned to the other player.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a greedy approach where, at each step, we compare the current digit with the next digit. If they are equal, we assign the current digit to the player who has fewer digits so far to balance their numbers and potentially increase the sum. This ensures that both players' numbers grow in a way that maximizes their combined value.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each digit exactly once, making it linear in time complexity, O(2n), which is efficient given the constraint n ≤ 18.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    s = []\n    count_H = 0\n    count_M = 0\n    \n    for i in range(2 * n):\n        if i < len(A_str) - 1:\n            if A_str[i] > A_str[i + 1]:\n                s.append('H')\n                count_H += 1\n            elif A_str[i] < A_str[i + 1]:\n                s.append('M')\n                count_M += 1\n            else:\n                if count_H < n:\n                    s.append('H')\n                    count_H += 1\n                else:\n                    s.append('M')\n                    count_M += 1\n        else:\n            if count_H >= n:\n                s.append('M')\n            else:\n                s.append('H')\n                \n    print(''.join(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A_str` of 2n digits.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `s` to build the sequence of moves, and counters `count_H` and `count_M` to track the number of digits each player has picked.\n3. **Greedy Decision Making**: For each digit in the string (except the last one), we compare it with the next digit:\n   - If the current digit is greater, assign it to the first player (Homer) to maximize the immediate gain.\n   - If the current digit is smaller, assign it to the second player (Marge).\n   - If digits are equal, assign to the player with fewer digits to balance their numbers.\n4. **Final Digit Handling**: The last digit is assigned to the player who hasn't yet reached n digits.\n5. **Output**: The constructed sequence of moves is printed as a string of 'H' and 'M' characters.\n\nThis approach ensures that the total prize is maximized by strategically assigning each digit to the player who can derive the most benefit from its value, leveraging a greedy strategy for efficiency.",
