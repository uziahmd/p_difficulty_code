There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n We are given n, h, m and then m lines of l, r, x.\n Since n, m <= 50, we can use dynamic programming with state compression or try to use constraints.\n\n However, note that the restrictions might overlap. The key is that in each spot i, the height must be at most the minimum of:\n   - h (the overall maximum)\n   - the maximum allowed by any restriction that covers i.\n\n But note: it's not just the minimum of all restrictions covering i, because a restriction says \"the tallest house from [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i\".\n However, if we set a house to a value too high, it might break a restriction that requires the entire range to have maximum <= x_i.\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Step 1: Precompute for each spot i, the maximum allowed height by the restrictions. However, note that a single restriction may cover multiple spots and the restriction condition is that the maximum in the entire range is <= x_i. So for a particular spot i, the maximum height we can assign is the minimum x_i among ALL restrictions that cover i? \n\n Actually, no. Because if we set a house at i to a value higher than some x_i, then the restriction which requires the entire interval [l_j, r_j] (that includes i) to have max <= x_j would be violated. Therefore, for each spot i, the height cannot exceed the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include i.\n\n But wait, what if two restrictions overlap? For example, one restriction says [1,3] <= 2, and another says [2,4] <= 3. Then for spot 2, we must satisfy both: the first restriction requires the entire [1,3] to be <=2, so spot2 must be <=2; the second requires the entire [2,4] to be <=3, so spot2 can be up to 3. The limiting factor is the minimum of the x_i from the restrictions that cover i.\n\n However, note: the first restriction says the entire [1,3] must be <=2. So even if the second restriction allows up to 3 for spot2, the first one forces spot2 to be <=2.\n\n Therefore, for each spot i, we can define:\n   base[i] = min{ x_j | for every restriction j such that l_j <= i <= r_j }\n\n But wait, is that sufficient? Consider: if we set each house to base[i], then for a restriction j: [l_j, r_j] must have maximum <= x_j. Since base[i] for each i in [l_j, r_j] is at most x_j (because x_j is one of the values we take the min over, and the min is <= x_j), then the maximum in [l_j, r_j] would be <= x_j. So yes, setting each house to base[i] satisfies all restrictions.\n\n However, is base[i] computed correctly? We take the minimum x_j for every restriction j that covers i. Then the house at i is set to base[i]. But note: we are allowed to set a house lower than base[i] as well. And sometimes we might want to set a house lower to allow adjacent houses to be higher? Actually, no: because the profit function is increasing (since a^2 is increasing) and we want to maximize the total sum. Therefore, we would set each house to the maximum allowed by the base (which is base[i]) because if we set it lower, we lose profit. However, wait: what if a house being too high causes a restriction to be broken? But we set the house to base[i] which is the minimal constraint from all restrictions that cover it, so it's safe.\n\n But wait again: consider two consecutive houses. Suppose we have two restrictions: \n   Restriction1: [1,2] <= 2\n   Restriction2: [2,3] <= 3\n\n For house1: base[1] = 2 (from Restriction1)\n For house2: base[2] = min(2,3) = 2 (from both restrictions)\n For house3: base[3] = 3 (from Restriction2)\n\n Then we set house1=2, house2=2, house3=3 -> profit = 4+4+9 = 17.\n\n But what if we set house2 to 3? Then house1 must be <=2 (because of Restriction1) and house3 must be <=3 (Restriction2). Also, for Restriction1: the maximum in [1,2] is max(2,3)=3 which violates Restriction1 (which requires <=2). Therefore, we cannot set house2 to 3.\n\n So the base[i] we computed is correct: we cannot set house2 to more than 2.\n\n However, note",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to certain zoning restrictions. The profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses built on each spot. The constraints specify that within certain ranges, the tallest house must not exceed a given height.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the optimal height for each house such that all zoning restrictions are satisfied. Each restriction imposes a maximum height on any house within a specified range. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the squares of the house heights.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For each house at position `i`, the maximum allowable height is the minimum value among all the restrictions that include this position. This is because any restriction covering the position `i` requires that no house in its range exceeds its specified height. Therefore, the most restrictive (smallest) height limit from all applicable restrictions must be respected for each house.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Preprocessing Restrictions**: For each position `i` (from 1 to `n`), compute the minimum height constraint (`base[i]`) by checking all restrictions that include `i`.\n   - **Maximizing Profit**: Once the constraints are established, the optimal height for each house is simply `base[i]` because the profit function (square of the height) is maximized when the height is as large as possible without violating any constraints.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm involves iterating over each position and each restriction to determine the minimal constraint, resulting in a time complexity of O(n*m), where `n` is the number of spots and `m` is the number of restrictions. Given the constraints (both `n` and `m` are up to 50), this approach is efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    m = int(data[2])\n    \n    base = [h] * (n + 1)\n    \n    index = 3\n    for _ in range(m):\n        l = int(data[index])\n        r = int(data[index + 1])\n        x_val = int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        for i in range(l, r + 1):\n            if x_val < base[i]:\n                base[i] = x_val\n    \n    total_profit = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total_profit += base[i] ** 2\n    \n    print(total_profit)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of spots (`n`), the maximum height (`h`), the number of restrictions (`m`), and the details of each restriction.\n2. **Base Array Initialization**: An array `base` is initialized with the maximum height `h` for each spot. This array will store the minimal height constraint for each spot after processing all restrictions.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, the algorithm checks all spots within the specified range and updates their minimal height constraint to the smallest value found among all applicable restrictions.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: The total profit is computed by summing the squares of the heights specified in the `base` array for each spot.\n5. **Output**: The computed total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all zoning restrictions are satisfied while maximizing the profit by leveraging the properties of the profit function and careful preprocessing of constraints.",
