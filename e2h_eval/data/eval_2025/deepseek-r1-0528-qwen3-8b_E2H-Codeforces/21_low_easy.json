The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and m, then a list of n integers (a_i) and a list of m integers (b_j).\n Condition: The j-th key can open the i-th chest if and only if (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1.\n\n Note: \n   (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1  <=> (a_i % 2) != (b_j % 2)\n\n So, we can categorize the chests and keys by their parity.\n\n Let:\n   Chests: \n        even_chests = number of chests with a_i % 2 == 0\n        odd_chests = number of chests with a_i % 2 == 1\n\n   Keys:\n        even_keys = number of keys with b_j % 2 == 0\n        odd_keys = number of keys with b_j % 2 == 1\n\n Then, an even key can open only odd-chests, and an odd key can open only even-chests.\n\n However, note that one key can be used at most once and one chest can be opened at most once.\n\n Therefore, we have two independent bipartite matching problems:\n\n  1. Between even_keys and odd_chests.\n  2. Between odd_keys and even_chests.\n\n But note: we cannot use an even key on an odd chest? Actually, wait: condition is (a_i + b_j) % 2 == 1.\n\n   If a_i is even, then we require b_j to be odd (because even + odd = odd).\n   If a_i is odd, then we require b_j to be even (because odd + even = odd).\n\n So actually:\n\n   - Even chests (a_i even) can be opened by odd keys.\n   - Odd chests (a_i odd) can be opened by even keys.\n\n Therefore, we have two sets:\n\n   Set A: even_chests (which need odd keys)\n   Set B: odd_chests (which need even keys)\n\n And we have two sets of keys:\n\n   odd_keys: these can open even_chests.\n   even_keys: these can open odd_chests.\n\n Now, we want to maximize the total number of chests opened.\n\n Since the two sets are independent (because the keys required for each type of chest are different and the keys are distinct), we can solve each separately as a bipartite graph with maximum matching. However, note that the matching in each bipartite graph is just the minimum between the count of available keys and chests for that set?\n\n Actually, because we don't have any further constraints (like one chest requiring multiple keys or vice versa) and we can assign arbitrarily, the maximum matching for the first set (even_chests and odd_keys) is the minimum of even_chests and odd_keys? Not exactly.\n\n But wait: the condition is that we have two independent sets. In fact, the problem reduces to:\n\n   We have two independent bipartite graphs:\n\n     Graph1: Left nodes = odd_keys, Right nodes = even_chests.\n     Graph2: Left nodes = even_keys, Right nodes = odd_chests.\n\n However, note: there is no edge between the two graphs. So the total matching is the sum of the two matchings.\n\n But in a complete bipartite graph (with all edges present) where the left side has L nodes and the right side has R nodes, the maximum matching is min(L, R). \n\n However, we don't have complete bipartite? Actually, the condition for an edge is fixed: every odd key can connect to every even chest (because the condition is satisfied regardless of the specific numbers, only the parity matters). Similarly, every even key can connect to every odd chest.\n\n Therefore, the maximum matching for Graph1 is min(even_chests, odd_keys) and for Graph2 is min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\n But wait: is that correct? Actually, no: because the keys are distinct and the chests are distinct, but the condition is purely by parity. Since every odd key can open every even chest and every even key can open every odd chest, then indeed the maximum matching for Graph1 is the minimum between the number of odd keys and the number of even chests, and similarly for Graph2.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to use each key only once, so the total matching from odd_keys to even_chests cannot exceed min(odd_keys, even_chests). Similarly for the other.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   answer = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n\n Let me test with the example:\n\n Example 1: \n   Input: \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\"\n\n   Chests: [9, 14, 6, 2, 11] -> \n        even_chests: 1",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the available keys. The key observation here is that a chest can only be opened by a key if the sum of their respective numbers is odd. This translates to checking the parity (even or odd) of the numbers on the chests and keys.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Chests and Keys by Parity**: \n   - **Even Chests**: Chests with even numbers (a_i % 2 == 0).\n   - **Odd Chests**: Chests with odd numbers (a_i % 2 == 1).\n   - **Even Keys**: Keys with even numbers (b_j % 2 == 0).\n   - **Odd Keys**: Keys with odd numbers (b_j % 2 == 1).\n\n2. **Matching Principle**:\n   - An even chest can only be opened by an odd key (since even + odd = odd).\n   - An odd chest can only be opened by an even key (since odd + even = odd).\n\n3. **Calculate Maximum Openings**:\n   - The maximum number of even chests that can be opened is the minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys.\n   - Similarly, the maximum number of odd chests that can be opened is the minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys.\n   - The total maximum chests Neko can open is the sum of these two minima.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    n = int(data[0])\n    m = int(data[1])\n    \n    chests = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    keys = list(map(int, data[2+n:2+n+m]))\n    \n    even_chests = 0\n    for num in chests:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chests += 1\n            \n    odd_chests = n - even_chests\n    \n    even_keys = 0\n    for num in keys:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_keys += 1\n            \n    odd_keys = m - even_keys\n    \n    result = min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests (n) and keys (m), followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Categorizing Chests**: The code counts how many chests have even numbers (even_chests) and how many have odd numbers (odd_chests).\n3. **Categorizing Keys**: Similarly, the code counts the number of even keys (even_keys) and odd keys (odd_keys).\n4. **Calculating Maximum Openings**: The solution calculates the maximum chests that can be opened by matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The result is the sum of these two matches.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed, which is the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages parity checks to simplify the problem into basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
