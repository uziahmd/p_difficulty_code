            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles as a string in one line. Each tile is two characters: a digit and a letter (m, p, or s). We need to compute the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that we have at least one mentsu (which can be either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Since we start with 3 tiles, and we can draw any number of tiles (any tile, including duplicates), we are allowed to have more than three. However, we only need one mentsu (a triplet or a sequence) in the entire hand.\n\n We can consider:\n 1. Already having a mentsu: then we output 0.\n 2. Otherwise, we consider drawing 1, 2, or 3 tiles (and possibly more, but we want the minimum).\n\n However, note that we are allowed to draw any tiles arbitrarily. But note: we don't necessarily have to use all the drawn tiles. We just need at least one mentsu.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Conditions for a koutsu (triplet):\n   - Three identical tiles (same digit and same suit). Example: ['1m','1m','1m'].\n\n Conditions for a shuntsu (sequence):\n   - Three consecutive digits (with wrap-around? Note: the problem says [9m,1m,2m] is not valid, so no wrap-around) in the same suit. So the numbers must be consecutive and in the same suit.\n\n We start with three tiles. We can consider:\n\n Case 0: Check if the current hand has a mentsu (either koutsu or shuntsu). Then answer 0.\n\n Case 1: Consider drawing 1 tile.\n\n   After drawing one tile, we have four tiles. We need to check if we can form a mentsu (using some three of the four). However, note that we can choose which three to form the mentsu.\n\n   Possibilities for a koutsu:\n     - If there is a tile that already appears at least twice, then drawing one more of that tile would complete a triplet. For example, if we have [1m, 1m, 2m], then we can draw another 1m to get a triplet (so 1 draw).\n     - Similarly, if we have two different tiles that appear twice, then we cannot form a triplet by drawing one because we can only complete one of them (but we are allowed to draw any tile, so if we have two pairs, we can complete one pair by drawing one, but we don't know which one we are going to use). However, we are looking for the minimum, so we consider the possibility of completing a triplet.\n\n   Possibilities for a shuntsu:\n     - The hand might have two tiles of the same suit that are adjacent and we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one. For example, [1m, 2m, 4m] -> we can draw 3m to get [1m,2m,3m]. But also, we might have two tiles that are not adjacent and we can complete the sequence by drawing the middle one? Actually, for a sequence we need three consecutive. So if we have two tiles, we can complete the sequence by drawing the third. But note: we have four tiles, and we are using three for the sequence. However, we are allowed to have the fourth tile being anything. So we can check: for each suit, group by suit, then for each group, if we have two or more tiles, we can check for sequences.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think: what is the minimum draws (0,1,2,3) needed?\n\n However, note: we are allowed to draw as many as we want, but we want the minimum.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Parse the input: one line with three strings (each string is two characters: digit and suit).\n\n 2. We will represent the hand as a list of two-character strings.\n\n 3. Check for existing mentsu (0 draws):\n\n    Check for koutsu: \n        Count frequency of each tile. If any tile appears 3 times, then we have a koutsu.\n\n    Check for shuntsu:\n        Group by suit. For each suit, extract the numbers (convert the first char to int) and sort them.\n        Then, for each distinct set of numbers in the same suit, check if there's a consecutive triplet (with step 1). But note: we have only three tiles initially. So we can have at most three numbers per suit.\n\n        Example: In a suit, we have [1,2,3] -> shuntsu.\n                 [1,2,4] -> we can form [1,2,3] if we draw 3, but wait, we are checking without drawing. Without drawing, we can look for a consecutive triplet",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that her hand contains at least one mentsu (either a koutsu or a shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Koutsu (Triplet)**: Three identical tiles (same number and suit).\n   - **Shuntsu (Sequence)**: Three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n   - The solution involves checking if the current hand already contains a mentsu (0 draws needed). If not, we check for scenarios where drawing 1, 2, or 3 tiles can form a mentsu.\n\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Check for Existing Mentsu**: Examine the hand for any triplet or sequence.\n   - **Triplet Completion**: If any tile appears at least twice, drawing one more of that tile completes a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Completion**: For each suit, check if two tiles can form part of a sequence. The missing tile can be drawn to complete the sequence.\n   - **Edge Cases**: Consider hands with fewer than three tiles of the same suit or non-consecutive numbers.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Frequency Check**: For triplets, count occurrences of each tile.\n   - **Sequence Check**: For sequences, group tiles by suit and check for consecutive numbers.\n   - **Minimum Draws Calculation**: Determine the minimal draws required by evaluating all possible completion scenarios for both triplets and sequences.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - The solution efficiently checks all possible combinations in linear time relative to the number of tiles (here, fixed at three initially, then considering up to six tiles after drawing).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    tiles = [tile for tile in data if tile]\n    \n    n = len(tiles)\n    if n != 3:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for existing mentsu (koutsu or shuntsu)\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    suits = defaultdict(list)\n    for tile in tiles:\n        num = int(tile[0])\n        s = tile[1]\n        freq[tile] += 1\n        suits[s].append(num)\n\n    # Check koutsu (triplet)\n    if any(count >= 3 for count in freq.values()):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check shuntsu (sequence)\n    for s in suits:\n        nums = sorted(set(suits[s]))\n        if len(nums) < 3:\n            continue\n        for i in range(len(nums) - 2):\n            if nums[i+1] == nums[i] + 1 and nums[i+2] == nums[i] + 2:\n                print(0)\n                return\n\n    # Now, consider drawing 1, 2, or 3 tiles\n\n    # Case 1: Drawing 1 tile\n    # Possibility 1: Complete a triplet by drawing one more tile of a duplicated tile.\n    if any(count == 2 for count in freq.values()):\n        print(1)\n        return\n\n    # Possibility 2: Complete a sequence by drawing one tile.\n    for s, nums_list in suits.items():\n        nums_set = set(nums_list)\n        if len(nums_set) < 2:\n            continue\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            if num - 1 not in nums_set and num - 2 not in nums_set:\n                continue\n            if (num - 1 in nums_set and num - 2 in nums_set):\n                print(1)\n                return\n\n    # Case 2: Drawing 2 tiles\n    # Possibility 1: Complete a triplet by drawing two more tiles of a duplicated tile.\n    if any(count == 2 for count in freq.values()):\n        print(2)\n        return\n\n    # Possibility 2: Complete a sequence by drawing two tiles.\n    for s, nums_list in suits.items():\n        nums_set = set(nums_list)\n        if len(nums_set) < 2:\n            continue\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n            if (num - 1 in nums_set and num - 2 not in nums_set) or (num - 1 not in nums_set and num - 2 in nums_set):\n                print(2)\n                return\n\n    # Case 3: Drawing 3 tiles\n    # Possibility: Complete a triplet by drawing three tiles of a single tile (if none duplicated).\n    if all(count <= 1 for count in freq.values()):\n        print(3)\n    else:\n        print(2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the input has exactly three tiles. If not, it outputs 0 (though the problem guarantees three tiles).\n2. **Frequency and Suit Analysis**: It uses dictionaries to count tile frequencies and group tiles by suit.\n3. **Existing Mentsu Check**: It checks for triplets (any tile appearing three times) or sequences (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n4. **Drawing Scenarios**:\n   - **One Draw**: Checks if drawing one tile can complete a triplet (if any tile appears twice) or a sequence (if two tiles are part of a potential sequence).\n   - **Two Draws**: Checks if drawing two tiles can complete a triplet or a sequence.\n   - **Three Draws**: If no duplicates exist, three draws are needed to form a triplet by adding three identical tiles.\n5. **Output**: The solution prints the minimum number of draws required based on the above checks.",
