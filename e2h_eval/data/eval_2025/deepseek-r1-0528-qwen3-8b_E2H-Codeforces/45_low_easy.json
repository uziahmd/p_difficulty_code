There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n (number of players) and we need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n Observation:\n In a knockout tournament with n players, there are n-1 games in total. However, the winner must win all his/her games.\n\n But note: the tournament structure is constrained by the rule: two players can play only if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n We are to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n\n Let's think about how the tournament can be structured to allow the winner to play as many games as possible.\n\n The key idea is that the tournament can be broken down into two halves (or more) but the constraint on the difference of games played might force us to balance the bracket.\n\n Alternatively, we can model the problem by considering that the entire tournament is a complete binary tree (if n is a power of two) and then the winner would have to go through log2(n) rounds. However, the examples:\n\n  Input: 2 -> Output: 1\n          3 -> Output: 2\n          4 -> Output: 2\n\n Why for n=3, the answer is 2? Because we can have two games: \n   First game: Player1 vs Player2, then the winner (Player1) plays Player3.\n\n But wait, the rule says: two players can play only if the number of games they have played differs by at most one.\n\n In the case n=3:\n   After the first game (Player1 vs Player2): \n      Player1 has 1 game, Player2 has 0 -> then they meet again? Actually, the rule says \"already played\" meaning prior to this game. So when Player1 and Player3 are going to play, Player1 has 1 game and Player3 has 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed.\n\n However, if we consider n=4:\n   One way: \n        Round1: (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4)\n        Then the winner of round1 (say 1) vs winner of round2 (say 3). \n        Then the winner (say 1) has 2 games.\n\n   But is there a way for the winner to have 3 games? \n        Total games: 3 would require 4 wins (because the winner must win 3 games) but we only have 4 players. \n        Actually, the total wins needed for the winner to have 3 wins is 3, but then the other three players each lose one game (so 3 losses) and the total games would be 3 (since each game produces one loss) but we have 4 players: the winner must have won 3 games, so the other 3 players must have lost one game each, and the tournament must have 3 games. However, the structure:\n\n        Game1: 1 vs 2 -> 1 wins\n        Game2: 1 vs 3 -> 1 wins\n        Game3: 1 vs 4 -> 1 wins\n\n        But wait, can the winner play three consecutive games? \n            - Before the second game, player1 has 1 game, and player3 has 0. Difference is 1 -> allowed.\n            - Before the third game, player1 has 2 games, and player4 has 0. Difference is 2 -> not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot have three consecutive games for the winner.\n\n        Alternatively, we could try a different structure:\n\n        Game1: 1 vs 2 -> 1 wins\n        Game2: 1 vs 3 -> 1 wins (now player1 has 2 games, player3 has 0 and left)\n        Now, we have two remaining players: 1 and 4. But 1 has 2 games and 4 has 0 -> difference 2, so they cannot play.\n\n        How about:\n\n        Game1: 1 vs 2 -> 1 wins\n        Game2: 3 vs 4 -> 3 wins\n        Game3: 1 vs 3 -> 1 wins\n\n        This gives the winner 2 games, which is the same as above.\n\n        So for n=4, the maximum is 2.\n\n        For n=10, the example output is 4.\n\n        What is happening?\n\n        We can model the problem by building a bracket that allows the winner to have as many games as possible without violating the rule.\n\n        Another approach: we can use recursion or dynamic programming, but n can be up to 10^18.\n\n        Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required to have a tournament where the winner can have k games.\n\n        Consider: to have k games, the winner must defeat k opponents. But the rule restricts that the winner's previous games and the new opponent must not differ by more than one",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament follows a knockout format, meaning each player must win all their games to continue. The key constraint is that when two players compete, the difference in their previous game counts must not exceed one. The goal is to maximize the number of games the winner plays.\n2. **Insight**: The solution involves recognizing a pattern where the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by finding the largest integer \\( k \\) such that the sum of a series \\( 2^0 + 2^1 + \\ldots + 2^{k-1} \\) is less than or equal to \\( n \\). This series represents the total number of players needed to structure the tournament in a way that allows the winner to play up to \\( k \\) games without violating the game-playing rule.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the largest \\( k \\) (denoted as `max_games`) such that the sum of the geometric series \\( \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i \\leq n \\). The binary search operates over possible values of \\( k \\) from 0 to \\( \\log_2(n) + 1 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    low, high = 0, 1\n    while high < n:\n        high *= 2\n    high += 1\n    max_games = 0\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        total_players = (1 << mid) - 1\n        if total_players <= n:\n            max_games = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    print(max_games)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is initialized with `low` set to 0 and `high` initially set to 1. The loop doubles `high` until it exceeds \\( n \\), ensuring the search space covers all possible values of \\( k \\).\n2. **Finding Maximum Games**: For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, the total number of players required to allow the winner to play `mid` games is calculated as \\( 2^{mid} - 1 \\). If this value is less than or equal to \\( n \\), it means the winner can play up to `mid` games, so `max_games` is updated and the search continues for higher values. Otherwise, the search continues in the lower half.\n3. **Output Result**: After the binary search completes, `max_games` holds the maximum number of games the winner can play, which is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( k \\) using binary search, leveraging the properties of geometric series to ensure optimal performance even for very large \\( n \\) (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)).",
