Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position, and zero otherwise.For example, if n = 4 and x = 11 (11 = 20 + 21 + 23), then f(x) = a0 + a1 + a3.Help Valera find the maximum of function f(x) among all x, for which an inequality holds: 0 ≤ x ≤ m.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of array elements.

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given:\n   n: the number of array elements\n   a list of n integers a0, a1, ..., an-1\n   a string s of length n (the binary representation of m, from most significant to least significant? Note: the problem says \"s0s1...sn-1\" and then m equals the sum of s_i * 2^(n-1-i) for i=0 to n-1? Actually, note the example: \n        Input: '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010'\n        Here, n=5, m is given by binary string \"11010\". \n\n But note: the example input format is provided as three lines. The third line is a string without spaces.\n\n However, the problem states: \n        \"The third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1... sn - 1 — the binary representation of number m.\"\n\n And then: m = s0*2^(n-1) + s1*2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1}*2^0.\n\n But wait: in the example, n=4 and x=11 (which is 1011) but the example input for m is \"10\", meaning n=2 and m=2 (binary \"10\" -> 2). Then in the second sample, n=5 and m is \"11010\".\n\n Let me clarify the example: \n        Example 1: \n          Input: \n            2\n            3 8\n            10\n\n          Here, the binary representation of m is \"10\", so m = 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2.\n\n        Example 2:\n          Input:\n            5\n            17 0 10 2 1\n            11010\n\n          Here, the binary representation of m is \"11010\", so m = 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 16+8+0+2+0 = 26.\n\n However, note the sample output for the second example is 27.\n\n Why? Because the function f(x) is defined by the bits set in x. The array a has indices 0 to n-1 (so 5 elements). Then:\n\n   f(0) = 0\n   f(1) = a0 (because the least significant bit is the 0th index? Actually, note: the problem says \"bit(i)\" is the i-th position. How is the binary representation aligned?\n\n The problem says: \n      \"Value f(x) is calculated by formula , where value bit(i) equals one if the binary representation of number x contains a 1 on the i-th position\"\n\n And the array a has n elements. The example: n=4 and x=11 (binary 1011) then f(x)=a0+a1+a3.\n\n This implies that the i-th bit (from the lowest power) is associated with a_i? Or the other way around?\n\n Let me read the problem again: the binary representation of x. The example says for x=11 (which is 1011) we have bits at positions 0,1, and 3 (if we consider the least significant bit as position 0). Then the array a has indices from 0 to n-1. \n\n But note: the example input for the array has two numbers: [3,8] for the first sample. Then f(0)=0, f(1)=a0=3. So when we set the 0-th bit (LSB) then we use a0. \n\n Now, what about the binary representation of m? The problem says: m is given by the binary string s0 s1 ... s_{n-1}. And m = s0*2^(n-1) + s1*2^(n-2) + ... + s_{n-1}*2^0.\n\n In the example with n=2, the binary string \"10\" means:\n        s0 = '1', s1 = '0'\n        m = 1*2^(1) + 0*2^(0) = 2.\n\n But note: the example says x can be from 0 to m (inclusive). So x from 0 to 2.\n\n Now, how does x relate to the bits? The problem does not specify the bit order. However, the example x=11 (in the second sample explanation) is 1011. Since n=4, we consider up to",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) \\) for all integers \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq x \\leq m \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as the sum of elements from array \\( a \\) corresponding to the positions where the binary representation of \\( x \\) has a 1. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that \\( f(x) \\) is maximized when we include as many positive elements from the array \\( a \\) as possible in the sum. However, the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\) limits which bits (positions) we can set in \\( x \\). The binary representation of \\( m \\) tells us which bits are allowed (up to the highest set bit) and which bits are restricted.\n\n2. **Bitwise Comparison**: We compare each bit of \\( x \\) (from least significant to most significant) with the corresponding bit in \\( m \\). If a bit in \\( x \\) is 0 and the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is 1, we can potentially set that bit in \\( x \\) to 1 if it increases the sum \\( f(x) \\). However, if a bit in \\( m \\) is 0, setting the corresponding bit in \\( x \\) to 1 would make \\( x \\) exceed \\( m \\), which is not allowed.\n\n3. **Greedy Strategy**: Starting from the least significant bit to the most significant bit, we decide whether to set each bit in \\( x \\) to 1 or 0. If setting a bit to 1 does not violate the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\) and the corresponding element in \\( a \\) is positive, we set it to 1. Otherwise, we leave it as 0.\n\n4. **Handling Constraints**: For each bit position, if the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is 1, we can freely choose to set it in \\( x \\) based on the benefit (positive \\( a[i] \\)). If the bit in \\( m \\) is 0, we must not set it in \\( x \\).\n\n5. **Sum Calculation**: The sum \\( f(x) \\) is accumulated by including \\( a[i] \\) whenever the i-th bit is set in \\( x \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    \n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    a_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    m_bin_str = data[2].strip()\n    \n    total_sum = sum(a_list)\n    current_sum = 0\n    x = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(m_bin_str)-1, -1, -1):\n        bit_val = int(m_bin_str[i])\n        if bit_val == 1:\n            if a_list[i] > 0:\n                current_sum += a_list[i]\n                x |= (1 << i)\n        else:\n            if a_list[i] > 0:\n                current_sum -= a_list[i]\n    \n    print(current_sum)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three parts: the number of elements \\( n \\), the array \\( a \\), and the binary string representation of \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Initial Setup**: The total sum of all elements in \\( a \\) is computed. This helps in adjusting the sum when bits are toggled.\n\n3. **Bitwise Processing**: The algorithm processes each bit from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit:\n   - If the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is 1, the bit can be set in \\( x \\) if the associated element in \\( a \\) is positive, thereby increasing the sum.\n   - If the corresponding bit in \\( m \\) is 0, the bit cannot be set in \\( x \\), so any positive contribution from that bit is subtracted from the total sum.\n\n4. **Output**: The final sum, which is the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) under the constraint \\( x \\leq m \\), is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the constraints by leveraging bitwise operations and a greedy strategy to maximize the sum while respecting the upper bound \\( m \\). The solution handles edge cases, such as all negative elements or zeros, by ensuring that only beneficial bits are set.",
