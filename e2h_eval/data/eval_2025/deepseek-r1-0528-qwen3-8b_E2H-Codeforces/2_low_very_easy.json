Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n  1. The two diagonals must have the same letter (say, 'X').\n  2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter (say, '.') and that letter is different from the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the example input includes:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox   -> Output \"NO\"\n\n   Why? Because in the third row (index 2, which is the middle) the third character (index 2) is 's' but it should be part of the diagonal? \n   Actually, let's break down:\n\n   The diagonals:\n      Main diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) -> all should be 'x'\n      Other diagonal: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0) -> all should be 'x'\n\n   But wait: in the third row (index 2) the center is (2,2). So the center must be the same for both diagonals? Yes, because (2,2) is on both.\n\n   Now, the non-diagonal positions: \n        In the first row: positions (0,1) and (0,2) and (0,3) must not be 'x'. They are 'o', 'o', 'o' -> okay.\n        Second row: (1,0), (1,2), (1,4): 'o','o','o' -> okay.\n        Third row: (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4): \n            (2,0): 's' -> this is not the diagonal? Actually, (2,0) is not on the main diagonal (which requires i=j) nor the anti-diagonal (which requires i+j=4). \n            So (2,0) is not a diagonal element. Therefore, we require that (2,0) is the same as the background letter and different from 'x'. But the background letter is supposed to be the same for all non-diagonals.\n\n   However, the example third row has two issues:\n        - The third row: the third character is 's' (at (2,2)) but (2,2) is diagonal, so that must be 'x'. However, the input has 's' at (2,2). So already the diagonals are broken.\n\n   But wait: the example input third row is \"soxoo\", meaning:\n        index0: 's'\n        index1: 'o'\n        index2: 'x'\n        index3: 'o'\n        index4: 'o'\n\n   So the center is 'x' which is correct. Then why NO?\n\n   Let me check the example input: \n        Input: ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox']\n\n   The diagonals are:\n        Main: [x, o, x, o, x] -> not all the same! Because the second element (from top left) is 'o' (from the second row, second column) but should be the same as the diagonal letter.\n\n   Actually, the main diagonal is: \n        row0: 'x'\n        row1: 'o' (from \"oxoxo\" -> second character)\n        row2: 'x'\n        row3: 'o'\n        row4: 'x'\n\n   So the main diagonal has alternating letters? That breaks condition 1.\n\n   Condition 1: on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same.\n\n   Therefore, the main diagonal must be all the same letter, say 'x'. Similarly, the anti-diagonal must be all the same letter, and that letter is also 'x'. \n\n   In the example, the main diagonal has two 'x's and three 'o's? Actually, no: \n        The main diagonal: \n            (0,0): 'x'\n            (1,1): from the second row (index1) and second character (index1) -> the second row is \"oxoxo\", so index1 is 'o'\n            (2,2): 'x'\n            (3,3): from fourth row (index3) and fourth character (index3): the fourth row is \"oxoxo\", so index3 is 'o'\n            (4,4): 'x'\n\n   So the main diagonal is \"x\", \"o\", \"x\", \"o\", \"x\" -> not all same.\n\n   Similarly, the anti",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: The main diagonal consists of cells where the row index equals the column index (i.e., (0,0), (1,1), ..., (n-1,n-1)). The anti-diagonal consists of cells where the row index plus the column index equals n-1 (i.e., (0,n-1), (1,n-2), ..., (n-1,0)).\n2. **Uniform Diagonal Letters**: All letters on both diagonals must be identical. This means every cell in the main diagonal and every cell in the anti-diagonal should have the same letter.\n3. **Uniform Non-Diagonal Letters**: All letters not on either diagonal must be identical and different from the diagonal letters. This requires checking that every cell not on the diagonals has the same letter, which is distinct from the diagonal letter.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    # Collect all letters from the two diagonals\n    diag_letter1 = set()\n    diag_letter2 = set()\n    center = None\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        diag_letter1.add(grid[i][i])\n        diag_letter2.add(grid[i][n-1-i])\n        \n    if len(diag_letter1) != 1 or len(diag_letter2) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    diag_char = next(iter(diag_letter1))\n    anti_diag_char = next(iter(diag_letter2))\n    \n    if diag_char != anti_diag_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check non-diagonal cells\n    background_char = None\n    valid = True\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            if background_char is None:\n                background_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != background_char:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n            \n    if not valid or background_char is None or background_char == diag_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the size of the grid `n` and then reads each line of the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: It checks all letters on both diagonals. If the diagonals do not consist of the same letter, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: For cells not on the diagonals, it ensures all these cells have the same letter and that this letter is different from the diagonal letter. If any cell on the non-diagonal does not meet this condition, it outputs \"NO\".\n4. **Output Result**: If all conditions are satisfied, it outputs \"YES\"; otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming an \"X\" by systematically checking each required part of the grid. The solution handles edge cases, such as different letters on the diagonals or non-uniform non-diagonal letters, by early termination and validation checks.",
