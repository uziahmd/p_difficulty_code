Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given two integers n and l, then a list of n integers (lantern positions)\n Steps:\n 1. Sort the lantern positions.\n 2. The street must be from 0 to l.\n 3. We need to cover the entire street [0, l] with intervals centered at each lantern with radius d.\n\n Observation:\n The entire street is covered if:\n   - The leftmost point (0) is covered by some lantern or the first lantern's light covers from 0 to (a0 + d).\n   - Similarly, the rightmost point (l) must be covered.\n\n We can break the problem into segments:\n\n  a) From the start (0) to the first lantern: \n        The first lantern must cover from 0 to a0. So the required d for this part is at least (a0 - 0) / 2.\n\n  b) Between consecutive lanterns (from i-th to (i+1)-th, where i from 0 to n-2):\n        The gap between two consecutive lanterns is (a[i+1] - a[i]). To cover the entire gap, we need to have the light from both sides meet in the middle.\n        The required d for this gap is (gap) / 2. But note: if the two lanterns are too far apart, then d must be at least (gap)/2.\n\n  c) From the last lantern to the end (l):\n        The last lantern must cover from a_last to l. So d must be at least (l - a_last) / 2.\n\n However, note that the lanterns can be located at the same point, so we have to consider the gaps.\n\n But wait: the entire street must be covered. The idea is to find the minimum d such that:\n\n   d >= (a0 - 0) / 2\n   d >= (l - a_last) / 2\n\n   For every gap between consecutive lanterns (after sorting): d >= (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2\n\n Then the answer is the maximum of these values? \n\n Why maximum? Because the light must cover the entire street, so we require that d is at least as big as the maximum requirement from any segment.\n\n However, let's test with the example: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n\n   n=2, l=5, lanterns at [2,5]\n\n   a0 = 2 -> (2-0)/2 = 1.0\n   a_last = 5 -> (5-5)/2 = 0.0\n   gap between 2 and 5: (5-2)/2 = 1.5\n\n   Then the maximum is 1.5? But the example output is 2.0.\n\n Let me reexamine: \n\n The sample says: \"At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] and the second lantern will light [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street [0,5] is lit.\"\n\n But note: the example uses d=2, which is greater than 1.5. However, wait: why is 2 the answer?\n\n Let's think about the coverage:\n\n   First lantern at 2 with d=2: covers [0,4]\n   Second lantern at 5 with d=2: covers [3,7] (but the street ends at 5, so [3,5])\n\n   The entire street is [0,5]. The coverage from 0 to 4 is by the first lantern, and from 3 to 5 is by the second. The point 4.5 is covered by both, but what about the point between 4 and 5? Actually, the first lantern only goes up to 4, and the second lantern starts at 3. So from 4 to 5 is covered by the second lantern? Actually, the second lantern's coverage starts at 5-d = 3, so yes, it covers from 3 to 7, so from 3 to 5 is covered.\n\n However, note that the gap between the two lanterns is from 2 to 5. The midpoint is (2+5)/2 = 3.5. The distance from the first lantern to the midpoint is 1.5, so d must be at least 1.5 to cover the midpoint from the first lantern OR from the second lantern? \n\n Actually, the condition for covering the gap between two lanterns is that the two lights must overlap. The condition is: \n   a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d   =>   d >= (a_{i+1] - a_i) / 2\n\n But wait, that is exactly what we did. Then the maximum of (a0/2, (last-l)/2, and max_gap/2) should be the answer.\n\n In the example, the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, so (5-2)/2 = 1.5, but the answer is 2.0.\n\n Alternatively, maybe we don't need to cover the entire gap with one lantern? Actually, the condition is that the entire street must be covered. The way we break down the problem is:\n\n   The entire street is covered if:\n      1. The first lantern (at position a0) must cover from 0 to a0+d. Therefore, 0 must be within [a0-d, a0+d] or we extend the coverage from the left. Actually, the requirement for the left end is that the first lantern must cover 0: so a0 - d <= 0 is not necessary because we can use the right side of the first lantern. Actually, the light extends to the left from a0. So the leftmost point 0 must be <= a0 + d. But also, the light extends to the right from a0. Similarly, for the right end.\n\n Actually, let me correct the conditions:\n\n   - The left end (0) must be within [a0 - d, a0 + d]? Actually, no. The light from the first lantern must cover 0. The condition for 0 is: there exists a lantern such that |x - ai| <= d. But if the first lantern is the closest to 0, then we require 0 <= a0 + d (because the light goes from a0-d to a0+d). But also, the light from the first lantern must extend at least to 0. So the condition for the first lantern is: d >= a0 (if we consider that the lantern is at a0 and the left end is 0). Similarly, for the last lantern: d >= l - a_last.\n\n   However, for the middle gaps: between two lanterns at positions a_i and a_{i+1}, the entire segment [a_i, a_{i+1}] must be covered. But note: the light from the left lantern (a_i) goes to a_i + d, and the light from the right lantern (a_{i+1}) goes to a_{i+1} - d. The condition for the gap is that a_i + d >= a_{i+1} - d, which again gives d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2.\n\n But wait, the example input \"2 5\\n2 5\" has two lanterns at 2 and 5. The left end condition: d >= 2 (to cover 0 from the first lantern) and the right end condition: d >= 0 (because 5 is at the end). And the gap condition: d >= (5-2)/2 = 1.5.\n\n So the maximum of 2, 0, and 1.5 is 2.\n\n Correction: The condition for the left end is actually that the first lantern must cover from 0 to a0+d. So the left end 0 must be <= a0+d. Therefore, d must be at least a0 (if a0>0). Similarly, the right end: the last lantern must cover from a_last-d to l, so d must be at least (l - a_last).\n\n However, note: the street is from 0 to l. The first lantern is at a0. To cover 0, we require that 0 >= a0 - d, which means d >= a0. Similarly, for the last lantern: d >= l - a_last.\n\n But wait, what if there are multiple lanterns? Actually, the entire street must be covered. The coverage from the first lantern must extend from 0 to a0+d. Then the next lantern must cover from a0+d (or beyond) to ... but wait, we don't require each lantern to cover the entire street. The condition is that the union of all intervals [ai-d, ai+d] must cover [0, l].\n\n So the conditions are:\n\n   Condition 1: The leftmost point 0 must be covered. The first lantern's interval is [a0-d, a0+d]. Since the lanterns are sorted, the first lantern is the closest to 0. So we require that 0 is in [a0-d, a0+d] OR if the first lantern is not at 0, then the interval must extend to 0. This is equivalent to: d >= a0 (because the left edge of the first lantern's light is a0-d, and we require a0-d <= 0 -> d>=a0). But wait, actually: the condition is that 0 >= a0-d -> d>=a0. Similarly, for the right end: d >= l - a_last.\n\n   Condition 2: For the gaps between lanterns, we require that the entire gap is covered. Specifically, for two consecutive lanterns at positions a_i and a_{i+1}, the gap between them is [a_i, a_{i+1}]. The light from the left lantern extends to a_i+d, and the light from the right lantern extends to a_{i+1}-d. For the gap to be covered, we require that a_i+d >= a_{i+1}-d, i.e., d >= (a_{i+1} - a_i) / 2.\n\n However, note: the entire street is [0, l]. The lanterns might be placed arbitrarily.\n\n But wait, the above two conditions (left end and right end) are already included in the gap conditions if we consider the entire street as having gaps from 0 to the first lantern and from the last lantern to l. \n\n Alternatively, we can consider:\n\n   The entire street is broken into segments:\n\n     Segment 0: from 0 to a0 (the first lantern)\n     Segment i: from a_i to a_{i+1} (for i from 0 to n-2)\n     Segment n-1: from a_last to l\n\n   For the first segment, the required d is a0/2 (if we require the first lantern to cover 0, then the distance from the lantern to 0 is a0, so the radius must be at least a0). But wait, no: the lantern at a0 covers from a0-d to a0+d. To cover 0, we require that a0-d <= 0, so d>=a0. Similarly, to cover the right end, d>=l - a_last.\n\n   For the gaps between lanterns, the gap is (a_{i+1}-a_i) and we require that the two adjacent lanterns together cover the entire gap. The light from the left lantern must reach at least the midpoint, and the light from the right lantern must reach the midpoint. So the minimal d for the gap is (a_{i+1]-a_i)/2.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal d must be at least the maximum of:\n        a0, \n        (a_{i+1}-a_i)/2 for all i from 0 to n-2,\n        l - a_last.\n\n But wait: in the example, \n        a0 = 2, so condition1: d>=2\n        gap condition: (5-2)/2 = 1.5 -> so d>=1.5\n        condition2: l - a_last = 5-5=0 -> d>=0\n\n   Then the maximum is 2.\n\n However, let me test with the first sample: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n\n   Sort the lanterns: [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n\n   Condition1: d >= 0 (since the first lantern is at 0, so no requirement from the left)\n   Condition2: d >= 15-15 = 0 (right end)\n   Condition3: gaps:\n        3-0 = 3 -> d>= 1.5\n        5-3 = 2 -> d>=1\n        7-5 = 2 -> d>=1\n        9-7 = 2 -> d>=1\n        14-9 =5 -> d>=2.5\n        15-14=1 -> d>=0.5\n\n   Then the maximum is 2.5.\n\n   The sample output is 2.5.\n\n Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n   Step 1: Read n, l and the list of lantern positions.\n   Step 2: Sort the list.\n   Step 3: Consider three parts:\n\n        d1 = 0 if the first lantern is at 0, otherwise the first lantern is at a0, so d1 = a0 (because we need to cover from 0 to a0: the distance is a0, so d must be at least a0)\n\n        Actually, note: the first lantern is at a0. The distance from 0 to a0 is a0. The light from the first lantern must cover 0. The condition is: a0 - d <= 0 -> d >= a0. But wait, if the lantern is at 0, then d>=0 is the condition. So we can write: d1 = a0\n\n        Similarly, for the last lantern: d2 = l - a_last\n\n        Then for the gaps: for i in range(n-1): gap = a[i+1] - a[i], then candidate = gap / 2.0\n\n        Then answer = max(d1, d2, max_gap/2) ?\n\n        But wait: the left end condition is d>=a0, the right end condition is d>=l-a_last, and the gaps condition is d>= (a[i+1]-a[i])/2.\n\n        However, note: the gaps condition is independent. We take the maximum of all these.\n\n   But wait: what if the first lantern is at 0? Then d1 = 0, and the gaps condition for the first gap (from 0 to next) is (a1-0)/2. But the condition for the left end is 0, and the condition for the gap is (a1)/2. Which one is more restrictive? It depends.\n\n   Example: n=1, l=10, and the lantern is at 0. Then we require d>=0 (from left) and d>=10 (from right). Also, no gaps. So answer=10.\n\n   However, if we do:\n\n        d1 = 0\n        d2 = 10 - 0 = 10\n        gaps: none -> so max(0,10)=10.\n\n   Another example: n=1, l=10, lantern at 5. Then:\n\n        d1 = 5 (to cover 0)\n        d2 = 10-5 = 5\n        gaps: none.\n\n        So answer=5.\n\n   Now, consider two lanterns: [0,10] and l=10.\n\n        d1 = 0\n        d2 = 0\n        gaps: 10-0=10 -> candidate=5.\n\n        Then the answer would be 5.\n\n        Check: With d=5, the first lantern (at0) covers [-5,5] -> so 0 to 5 is covered. The second lantern (at10) covers [5,15] -> so 5 to 10 is covered. The entire street [0,10] is covered.\n\n   So the formula holds.\n\n   However, wait: the condition for the left end is d>=a0 (which is 0) and for the right end is d>=10-10=0, and the gap condition is (10-0)/2=5.\n\n   Therefore, we must consider:\n\n        candidate1 = a[0]   # for the left end: to cover from 0 to a[0] we need at least a[0] (because the light must extend from a[0] to 0, so d>=a[0])\n        candidate2 = l - a[-1]   # for the right end\n        candidate3 = 0.0\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            candidate = gap / 2.0\n            if candidate > candidate3:\n                candidate3 = candidate\n\n        Then answer = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n   But wait: what if there is only one lantern? Then we don't have any gap, but we have candidate1 and candidate2.\n\n   However, note: the above candidate1 and candidate2 are computed from the first and last lantern.\n\n   But wait, is candidate1 always the left end? Actually, the left end is 0, and the first lantern is at a[0]. The condition is that the first lantern must cover 0. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. So the light must extend at least a[0] to the left. Therefore, d must be at least a[0]. Similarly, the last lantern must extend at least (l - a[-1]) to the right.\n\n   However, what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then we require d>=a[0] to cover 0. But if the first lantern is at 0, then we require d>=0 (which is trivial). Similarly, if the last lantern is at l, then d>=0.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require the lanterns to be at integer coordinates, and the inputs are integers. The answer must be a float.\n\n   However, consider the example: two lanterns at [0,5] for a street of length 5.\n\n        candidate1 = 0\n        candidate2 = 5-5 = 0\n        gap: (5-0)/2 = 2.5\n\n        Then the answer is 2.5.\n\n        Check: With d=2.5, the first lantern (at0) covers [-2.5,2.5] -> so [0,2.5] is covered. The second lantern (at5) covers [2.5,7.5] -> so [2.5,5] is covered. The entire street [0,5] is covered.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But wait, in the example with two lanterns at [0,5] and l=5, note that the street is from 0 to 5. The entire street is [0,5]. The coverage from the first lantern goes to 2.5, and the second lantern starts at 2.5. So the point 2.5 is covered by both.\n\n   However, note the condition for the gap: the gap is 5 (from 0 to 5). The condition for the gap is d>= (5-0)/2 = 2.5.\n\n   So the algorithm is:\n\n        Read n and l.\n        Read the list of n integers and sort it.\n\n        candidates = []\n\n        # Left end: from 0 to the first lantern\n        if n == 0:\n            # But n>=1 per the problem, so skip\n            pass\n        else:\n            candidates.append(a[0])   # to cover 0, we need at least a[0] from the first lantern\n\n        # Right end: from the last lantern to l\n        candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n\n        # Gaps between consecutive lanterns\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n        Then answer = max(candidates) if candidates is not empty.\n\n   However, wait: what if there are no lanterns? The problem states n>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n   But wait: the condition for the left end: we said d>=a[0]. Is that correct? \n\n        The first lantern is at a0. The light from the first lantern must cover 0. The condition is: 0 must be in [a0-d, a0+d]. \n        => a0-d <= 0 <= a0+d.\n        The right inequality (0<=a0+d) is always true if a0>=0 and d>=0, because a0>=0 and d>=0.\n        The left inequality: a0-d <= 0  => d>=a0.\n\n        Similarly, for the last lantern: d>=l - a_last.\n\n   Therefore, the above holds.\n\n   However, let me test with a different example: three lanterns at [1,2,3] for a street of length 3.\n\n        Left end: d>=1\n        Right end: d>=0\n        Gaps: \n           gap1: 2-1=1 -> candidate 0.5\n           gap2: 3-2=1 -> candidate 0.5\n\n        Then the maximum is 1.\n\n        Check: With d=1, the first lantern (at1) covers [0,2]. The second lantern (at2) covers [1,3]. The third lantern (at3) covers [2,4]. The entire street [0,3] is covered.\n\n   It works.\n\n   But wait, the gap condition: for the gap between 1 and 2: we require d>=0.5, which is satisfied by d=1.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the entire street is the maximum of the three requirements: \n        left end: 1\n        right end: 0\n        gaps: max(0.5,0.5)=0.5\n\n        So the maximum is 1.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        candidates = []\n\n        # If there is at least one lantern\n        candidates.append(a[0])   # left end\n\n        candidates.append(l - a[-1])   # right end\n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            # The gap between a[i-1] and a[i] is a[i] - a[i-1]\n            # But wait, we are iterating from index1 to n-1. Alternatively, we can do for i in range(n-1): gap = a[i+1]-a[i]\n            # Let me change the loop to use the previous method.\n\n        # Let me rewrite the gaps loop separately:\n\n        # We'll do:\n        #   for i in range(n-1):\n        #       gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        #       candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n        # But note: the above left end and right end are independent. The gaps are between consecutive lanterns.\n\n   Code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))\n\n        candidates = [a[0]]   # left end\n        candidates.append(l - a[-1])   # right end\n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            # The gap between a[i-1] and a[i] is a[i] - a[i-1]\n            # But wait, our list is sorted, and we are at index i, so the gap from the previous lantern (a[i-1]) to the current (a[i]) is a[i]-a[i-1]\n            # However, we can also iterate from i=0 to n-2: gap = a[i+1]-a[i]\n            # Let me change to a simpler loop.\n\n        # Actually, let me use a separate loop for gaps:\n\n        # But note: the above two conditions (left and right) are for the entire street boundaries, and the gaps are for the gaps between lanterns.\n\n        # However, the gaps condition applies to every two consecutive lanterns.\n\n        # We can do:\n\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n        ans = max(candidates)\n\n        Print ans with 10 decimal places.\n\n   However, wait: what if there is only one lantern? Then the gaps loop runs from 0 to n-2, i.e., from 0 to -1 (if n=1, then n-1=0, so range(0) is empty). So no gap added. Then candidates = [a0, l-a0] and we take the max of these two.\n\n   Example: one lantern at 5, street length 10.\n\n        candidates = [5, 10-5=5] -> max=5.0.\n\n   This is correct: the lantern must cover from 0 to 5 and from 5 to 10. So d must be at least 5.\n\n   But wait, is 5 enough? \n        The lantern at 5 with d=5: covers [0,10]. Perfect.\n\n   One more example: one lantern at 0, street length 10.\n\n        candidates = [0, 10] -> max=10.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left end is d>=a0, which is 0. And the condition for the right end is d>=10. So the maximum is 10.\n\n   But wait: the lantern is at 0, and we require d>=10 to cover the right end? Yes, because the street goes to 10, and the lantern at 0 can only cover up to 0+d. So d must be at least 10.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))\n\n        candidates = []\n        if n > 0:\n            candidates.append(a[0])\n            candidates.append(l - a[-1])\n            for i in range(1, len(a)):\n                # The gap between a[i-1] and a[i] is a[i] - a[i-1]\n                # But we can also use the gap from the previous element, but note: the gaps condition is for consecutive lanterns.\n                # However, we are iterating from i=1 to n-1, so we are using the gap between a[i-1] and a[i] for i from 1 to n-1.\n                # Alternatively, we can iterate over the gaps directly.\n\n            # Alternatively, we can do:\n            for i in range(len(a)-1):\n                gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n                candidates.append(gap/2.0)\n\n            ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   But wait: what if there are duplicate lanterns? For example, two lanterns at the same point.\n\n   Example: n=2, l=10, a=[5,5]\n\n        Then sorted a=[5,5]\n\n        candidates = [5, 10-5=5]\n\n        gaps: i=0: gap=0 -> 0/2=0.\n\n        Then the answer is 5.\n\n        Check: d=5, the first lantern (at5) covers [0,10] and the second lantern (at5) covers [0,10]. So the entire street is covered.\n\n   It works.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the gaps is the same even if the lanterns are at the same point. The gap is 0, so no additional constraint.\n\n   So the code is ready.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the lanterns may be located at the same point, and we are sorting, so duplicates are handled.\n\n   Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\"\n            n=7, l=15, a = [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\n            candidates from left: 0\n            candidates from right: 15-15=0\n            gaps: \n                3-0=3 -> 1.5\n                5-3=2 -> 1.0\n                7-5=2 -> 1.0\n                9-7=2 -> 1.0\n                14-9=5 -> 2.5\n                15-14=1 -> 0.5\n\n            max(candidates) = max(0,0,1.5,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,0.5) = 2.5 -> correct.\n\n        Example 2: \"2 5\\n2 5\"\n            n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]\n\n            candidates from left: 2\n            candidates from right: 5-5=0\n            gaps: 5-2=3 -> 1.5\n\n            max(2,0,1.5) = 2.0 -> correct.\n\n   However, wait: the example input was given as two separate strings? Actually, the example input format:\n\n        Input: \n            ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n        But in the problem, the input is read from stdin. We are reading the first line for n and l, then the next line for the n integers.\n\n   So the code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n   This reads two lines.\n\n   But note: the example input is given as a list of two strings? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        The first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l).\n\n   So we read two lines.\n\n   Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem constraints say n>=1, so we don't handle n=0.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        a.sort()\n\n        # If there are no lanterns, but the problem says n>=1, so we assume at least one.\n        candidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]\n\n        # If there is at least two lanterns, then we consider gaps.\n        for i in range(1, len(a)):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            # But wait, in the loop above we considered consecutive gaps. However, in the previous reasoning, we considered gaps between consecutive lanterns. But note: the gaps are between a[i-1] and a[i]. However, we are iterating from i=1 to n-1, so we are considering the gap from a[i-1] to a[i] for each i from 1 to n-1. But wait, when i=1, we consider a[1]-a[0]; i=2: a[2]-a[1]; ... until i=n-1: a[n-1]-a[n-2]. This is correct.\n\n            candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n\n        # However, wait: in the example above we did a loop from 0 to n-2 (using i+1) but here we are doing from i=1 to n-1 (using a[i]-a[i-1]). Both are the same.\n\n        ans = max(candidates)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\n   But wait, I just noticed: in the gap calculation above, I used a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1. But in the example we did for i in range(n-1): a[i+1]-a[i] is the same as a[i+1]-a[i] for i from 0 to n-2. \n\n   Actually, if we have n elements, the gaps are between consecutive pairs: (0,1), (1,2), ... , (n-2, n-1). \n\n   In the first method (using i from 0 to n-2) we do:\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n   In the second method (using i from 1 to n-1) we do:\n        for i in range(1, n):   # i from 1 to n-1\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n   These are the same gaps.\n\n   But wait, the example with two lanterns: [2,5] -> \n        First method: i=0: gap = a[1]-a[0]=5-2=3 -> candidate 1.5\n        Second method: i=1: gap = a[1]-a[0]=5-2=3 -> candidate 1.5\n\n   So both methods are correct.\n\n   However, the problem is that the above code for the gaps is using a[i]-a[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1, which is correct. But note: the first element is a[0] and the last is a[-1] (or a[n-1]).\n\n   But wait, the problem says the list a has n elements. So the gaps are from index0 to index1, index1 to index2, ... index(n-2) to index(n-1). \n\n   The above code for gaps (using i from 1 to n-1) will give n-1 gaps, which is correct.\n\n   However, we can also use:\n\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            candidates.append(gap/2.0)\n\n   That's the same.\n\n   I'll choose the first method (from 0 to n-2) for clarity.\n\n   Revised code:\n\n        n, l = map(int, input().split())\n        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        candidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]\n\n        # If there is more than one lantern, then we have gaps.\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            candidates.append(gap/2.0)\n\n        print(\"{:.10f}\".format(max(candidates)))\n\n   But wait: what if there is only one lantern? Then the for loop runs from 0 to 0 (if n=1, then len(a)=1, so range(0) is empty). Then we don't add any gap. Then we take max([a0, l-a0]).\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note: the above code for the gaps is appending the gaps for every consecutive pair. But the condition for the gaps is independent of the boundaries. \n\n   But wait: the boundaries are already taken care of by the two initial conditions (left and right). The gaps condition is about the coverage between two lanterns.\n\n   Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the lanterns may be located at the same point. Our gap calculation for two identical consecutive lanterns: gap=0 -> candidate 0.0, which is okay.\n\n   Let me test with two identical consecutive lanterns: [0,0,5] for l=5.\n\n        n=3, l=5, a=[0,0,5]\n\n        candidates from left: 0\n        candidates from right: 5-5=0\n        gaps: \n            i=0: gap = a[1]-a[0]=0-0=0 -> 0.0\n            i=1: gap = a[2]-a[1]=5-0=5 -> 2.5\n\n        Then max(0,0,0,2.5)=2.5\n\n        Check: With d=2.5, the first lantern (at0) covers [-2.5,2.5] -> so [0,2.5] is covered by the first two lanterns (both at0). The third lantern at5 covers [2.5,7.5] -> so [2.5,5] is covered. The entire street [0,5] is covered.\n\n   Correct.\n\n   However, note: the condition for the left end is 0, and the condition for the gap from the first two lanterns (which are at the same point) is 0, and the gap from the second lantern (at0) to the third (at5) is 5, so 2.5.\n\n   So the answer is 2.5.\n\n   But wait, is there a possibility that the entire street can be covered with d=2.5? \n\n        The first lantern (at0) with d=2.5: covers [0-2.5, 0+2.5] = [-2.5,2.5] -> so from 0 to 2.5 is covered by the first lantern (and the second lantern at0 also covers the same). Then the third lantern at5",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum light radius `d` such that all points on a street of length `l` are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are placed at specific positions along the street, and each lantern lights all points within a distance `d` from its position. The goal is to find the smallest `d` that ensures the entire street is covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The street is represented as a line segment from 0 to `l`. The lanterns are positioned at points `a_i` (sorted in ascending order). The solution involves ensuring that every point on the street is within `d` units of at least one lantern.\n2. **Key Insights**:\n   - **Left End Coverage**: The first lantern must cover the start of the street (0). The minimal `d` required here is the distance from the first lantern to 0, i.e., `a[0]`.\n   - **Right End Coverage**: The last lantern must cover the end of the street (`l`). The minimal `d` required here is the distance from the last lantern to `l`, i.e., `l - a[-1]`.\n   - **Gaps Between Lanterns**: For any two consecutive lanterns, the gap between them must be covered by their combined light. The minimal `d` required for a gap between two lanterns at positions `a[i]` and `a[i+1]` is `(a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves calculating the minimal `d` required for the left end, right end, and all gaps between consecutive lanterns. The maximum of these values gives the minimal `d` needed to cover the entire street.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: Sorting the lantern positions takes O(n log n) time. Calculating the required `d` values involves a linear scan through the sorted list, which is O(n). Thus, the overall complexity is O(n log n), which is efficient given the constraints (n ≤ 1000).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    l = int(data[1])\n    a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    candidates = [a[0], l - a[-1]]\n    \n    if n > 1:\n        for i in range(len(a)-1):\n            gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n            candidates.append(gap / 2.0)\n            \n    ans = max(candidates) if candidates else 0.0\n    print(\"{:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the street length `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to process them in ascending order.\n3. **Initial Candidates**: The initial candidates for the minimal `d` are derived from the left end (distance from the first lantern to 0) and the right end (distance from the last lantern to `l`).\n4. **Gap Processing**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the gap between them is calculated, and the required `d` to cover this gap is added to the candidates list.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The maximum value among all candidates is the minimal `d` needed to illuminate the entire street. This result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all parts of the street are covered by considering the critical points (ends and gaps between lanterns) and selecting the largest required `d` to meet all coverage conditions.",
