Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given an odd integer n, then n lines of n letters.\n Conditions for \"X\":\n  1. The two diagonals must have the same letter (say, 'X').\n  2. All the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter (say, '.') and that letter is different from the one on the diagonal.\n\n However, note: the example input includes:\n   Example 1: \n        5\n        xooox\n        oxoxo\n        soxoo\n        oxoxo\n        xooox   -> Output \"NO\"\n\n   Why? Because in the third row, the middle element is 's' but the diagonals are 'x'. The non-diagonal elements should be the same and different from the diagonal. In this case, the non-diagonal elements are not all the same (there's an 's' and many 'o').\n\n Steps:\n  Let the main diagonal be the set of positions (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n  The anti-diagonal is (i, n-1-i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n  Condition 1: All characters on the main diagonal must be the same, say `d1`.\n  Condition 2: All characters on the anti-diagonal must be the same, say `d2`.\n  Condition 3: `d1` must equal `d2`.\n  Condition 4: For every cell not on either diagonal, the character must be the same (say `other`) and `other` must not be equal to `d1`.\n\n However, note: what if the diagonals have different letters? Then condition 3 fails.\n\n But wait, the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\" and then \"all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different\".\n\n So we must check:\n  - The entire main diagonal is one letter (say A).\n  - The entire anti-diagonal is the same letter (must be A as well, because condition 3 requires they are the same and condition 4 requires the other letter is different from A).\n\n Actually, condition 3 is that the diagonals are the same (so both are A). Then condition 4: the rest must be a single letter (B) and B != A.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  Step 1: Read n and the grid.\n\n  Step 2: Check the two diagonals for being constant and then check if they are the same.\n\n    Let d1 = set of characters at (i, i) for all i in range(n)\n    Let d2 = set of characters at (i, n-1-i) for all i in range(n)\n\n    If d1 has more than one letter OR d2 has more than one letter, then condition fails.\n\n    Also, if d1 != {d} and d2 != {d} for the same d, then it fails.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n    diag1_letter = grid[i][i] for the first occurrence, then check all i: grid[i][i] == diag1_letter\n    diag2_letter = grid[i][n-1-i] for the first occurrence, then check all i: grid[i][n-1-i] == diag2_letter\n\n    Then check if diag1_letter == diag2_letter.\n\n  Step 3: Check the rest of the grid (non-diagonal cells) for having the same letter (say B) and that B != diag1_letter.\n\n    We can iterate over every cell (i, j):\n        if (i == j) or (i+j == n-1): skip (because these are the diagonals)\n        else: \n            if we haven't seen a candidate for the other letter, set candidate = grid[i][j]\n            else if grid[i][j] != candidate: then break (or mark invalid)\n\n    But note: there might be no non-diagonal cell? When n=1, but n>=3.\n\n  However, we must also ensure that the non-diagonal cells are all the same. And that same letter is not the diagonal letter.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n    non_diag_letters = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i+j == n-1:\n                continue\n            non_diag_letters.append(grid[i][j])\n\n    Then, if non_diag_letters is empty -> but n>=3, so there will be non-diagonal cells. Actually, the diagonals each have n elements, so total 2*n-1 (if no overlap) but actually the center is shared. So the number of non-diagonal cells is n*n - (2*n - 1) = n*(n-2) which for n>=3 is positive.\n\n    Then, if len(set(non_diag_letters)) > 1: condition fails.\n\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given grid of letters forms an \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - The main diagonal consists of cells where the row index equals the column index (i.e., `grid[i][i]` for all `i`).\n   - The anti-diagonal consists of cells where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1` (i.e., `grid[i][n-1-i]` for all `i`).\n   - Both diagonals must have the same letter repeated throughout. If either diagonal has more than one distinct letter, the answer is \"NO\".\n\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**:\n   - All cells not on either diagonal must contain the same letter.\n   - This letter must be different from the letter found on the diagonals.\n   - If any non-diagonal cell contains a different letter or if there are multiple different letters in the non-diagonal cells, the answer is \"NO\".\n\n3. **Final Check**:\n   - After verifying the diagonals and non-diagonal cells, if all conditions are met, output \"YES\"; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        line = input().strip()\n        grid.append(line)\n    \n    diag1_set = set()\n    diag2_set = set()\n    center_diag_letter = None\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        diag1_set.add(grid[i][i])\n        diag2_set.add(grid[i][n-1-i])\n    \n    if len(diag1_set) != 1 or len(diag2_set) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    diag_letter = next(iter(diag1_set))\n    if diag1_set != diag2_set:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    non_diag_letters = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n                continue\n            non_diag_letters.append(grid[i][j])\n            \n    if not non_diag_letters:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    if len(set(non_diag_letters)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    other_letter = non_diag_letters[0]\n    if other_letter == diag_letter:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the integer `n` (the size of the grid) and then reads `n` lines of input to form the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: It checks both diagonals (main and anti) to ensure all characters are the same. If either diagonal has more than one distinct character, it immediately outputs \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: It collects all characters not on the diagonals into a list. If these characters are not all the same or if they match the diagonal characters, it outputs \"NO\".\n4. **Output Result**: If all checks pass, it prints \"YES\", indicating the grid forms an \"X\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the conditions for forming an \"X\" by systematically checking each required part of the grid.",
