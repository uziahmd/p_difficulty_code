In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given three tiles as a string in one line. Each tile is two characters: a digit and a letter (m, p, or s). We need to compute the minimum number of extra tiles to draw so that we have at least one mentsu (which can be either a koutsu or a shuntsu).\n\n Since we start with 3 tiles, and we can draw any number of tiles (any tile, including duplicates), we are allowed to have more than three. However, we only need one mentsu (a triplet or a sequence) in the hand.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that we can draw tiles arbitrarily, so we can consider forming a mentsu from a subset of the existing tiles and then drawing the remaining ones.\n\n But note: the problem says \"minimum number of extra suited tiles\", so we are allowed to form a mentsu by possibly having more than three tiles? Actually, no: we only require that there is at least one mentsu (three tiles) in the hand. However, we might have to use some of the drawn tiles to complete the mentsu.\n\n However, note that the initial hand is three tiles. We can also leave some of the original tiles and use the drawn ones to complete the mentsu. But note: the mentsu must be exactly three tiles.\n\n There are two types of mentsu: \n   - Koutsu: three identical tiles (same number and same suit).\n   - Shuntsu: three consecutive numbers (with step 1) in the same suit.\n\n Since we can draw any tile, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Use all three tiles to form a mentsu.\n   - Check if the three tiles form a koutsu or a shuntsu.\n\n Option 2: Use two tiles and draw one tile to form a mentsu.\n Option 3: Use one tile and draw two tiles to form a mentsu.\n\n However, note: we don't necessarily need to use all the tiles. But wait: the problem says \"she must have at least one mentsu in her hand\". So even if we have more than three, we just need one set of three that forms a mentsu.\n\n But note: the hand after drawing will include the original three and the drawn ones. The mentsu must be three tiles that are present (at least one copy for each). However, the original hand may have duplicates.\n\n Let me clarify: the input gives three tiles. We can have duplicates? For example, the second example: ['9m', '9m', '9m'].\n\n So we need to consider the multiset of the three tiles.\n\n Approach:\n\n We can break the problem into two parts: checking for koutsu and shuntsu.\n\n However, note that we are allowed to draw tiles arbitrarily. We want the minimum number of draws.\n\n Let's consider:\n\n Case 0: Already have a mentsu -> 0 draws.\n\n Otherwise, we consider:\n\n Case 1: 0 draws: already have a mentsu? (check for koutsu or shuntsu)\n\n Case 2: 1 draw: can we form a mentsu by drawing one tile?\n\n   For koutsu: if we have two of the same tile, then drawing one more of that tile gives a triplet.\n\n   For shuntsu: if we have two tiles that are consecutive in the same suit, then we might need to draw the missing tile to complete the sequence.\n\n     Example: [1m, 2m] -> we need 3m to complete the shuntsu.\n\n     But note: sometimes we have two non-consecutive but we can form a sequence by drawing two? No, because we are considering one draw.\n\n     However, what if we have [1m, 3m]? Then we cannot form a shuntsu by drawing one tile (we need either 2m to make [1m,2m,3m] or 4m to make [3m,4m,5m] but wait, [1m,3m] doesn't allow a sequence with one draw because the sequence requires consecutive numbers. \n\n     Actually, we can form a sequence by drawing one tile only if we have two consecutive numbers (then we can complete the third). Or if we have one tile, we might be able to form a sequence by drawing two adjacent tiles? But we are only drawing one.\n\n     Therefore, for shuntsu with one draw: we must have two tiles that are consecutive and in the same suit, and then we can complete the sequence by drawing the missing one.\n\n Case 3: 2 draws: we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n   This could be:\n     - Two draws for a triplet: if we have one tile of a kind, we can draw two more to make a triplet. But wait, we can also form a sequence by drawing two. However, note that we might have multiple possibilities.\n\n   However, note: we can also use two tiles from the hand and draw two more to form a triplet (if we have two same, then we don't need two draws for triplet, we only need one). Similarly, for sequence, we might have one tile and we need to draw two adjacent ones.\n\n   But note: we might not be limited to using a contiguous set of two. We can also form a triplet from one tile (draw two) or a sequence from one tile (draw two adjacent ones). \n\n   However, let me think: \n\n   For triplet: if we have one tile, we can draw two more to make a triplet.\n\n   For sequence: if we have one tile, say 1m, then we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m]. But wait, that is two draws. Alternatively, we can form a sequence from three consecutive numbers by drawing two tiles? Actually, we can have two tiles that are not consecutive and then draw two to complete two different sequences? But note: we are only required to have one mentsu.\n\n   However, note: we can also use two tiles that are the same in a different way? Actually, no, because koutsu requires three identical, so if we have two same, then one more makes a triplet (so that would be one draw). \n\n   So two draws can be used for:\n\n     Option A: Forming a triplet from one tile (draw two of the same).\n\n     Option B: Forming a sequence from one tile: \n        Example: we have [1m]. Then we can draw [2m, 3m] to form [1m,2m,3m].\n\n     Option C: Forming a sequence from two tiles that are not consecutive: \n        Example: we have [1m, 4m]. Then we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (but wait, then we have two sets: [1m,2m,3m] and [1m,4m] is part of it. Actually, we are drawing two tiles to complete a sequence from [1m,4m] doesn't work. Alternatively, we might form a sequence from [4m] by drawing 5m and 6m? Then we have [4m,5m,6m].\n\n        Actually, we can also form a sequence from two tiles that are separated by one or two? \n\n        Let me reexamine: In one draw we can complete a sequence if we have two consecutive. With two draws, we can complete a sequence from one tile (by drawing two consecutive) or from two tiles that are two apart (like [1m,3m])? \n\n        Consider [1m,3m]: \n          We can draw 2m to complete [1m,2m,3m] -> that's one draw, which we already considered.\n\n        What about [1m,4m]? \n          We can form a sequence [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m (two draws) OR [4m,5m,6m] by drawing 5m and 6m (two draws). \n\n        But wait, can we form two different sequences from [1m,4m] by drawing two tiles? Yes, but note: we are only required to have one mentsu. So two draws are needed.\n\n        However, what if we have two tiles that are the same? Then we don't need two draws for sequence, we can use one draw for triplet.\n\n   But note: we might also form a sequence from three tiles that are not initially consecutive? Actually, the two draws might be used to complete a sequence from two tiles that are consecutive? No, consecutive needs one draw.\n\n   So the two-draw case covers:\n\n        - One tile: we can form a triplet (draw two) or a sequence (draw two consecutive, but note: we can also choose which consecutive set? Actually, we can choose the sequence that minimizes the required draws, but since we are computing minimum, we are going to check if 0,1,2,... draws are possible.\n\n   However, note: we might have a possibility of zero or one draw, so we don't need to go to two draws until we've ruled out 0 and 1.\n\n   But wait: what if we have three tiles that are all different and not forming a sequence? Then we might be able to form a mentsu by drawing two tiles.\n\n   Actually, the problem is to find the minimum draws. So we can check:\n\n   Step 1: Check if the hand already has a mentsu (0 draws).\n\n   Step 2: Check if by drawing one tile we can form a mentsu (1 draw).\n\n   Step 3: Check if by drawing two tiles we can form a mentsu (2 draws).\n\n   Then the answer is 0, 1, or 2.\n\n   But wait: is it always at most two? Because we have three tiles. \n\n   Consider: \n      We have three distinct tiles, no two same and no two consecutive in the same suit.\n\n      Example: [1m, 2p, 3s]\n\n      How many draws? \n        We can try to form a triplet: we can change two of them to the same tile (say 1m) then we have [1m, 1m, 1m] (but we changed two, so two draws). Alternatively, we can form a sequence in one suit. We have one tile per suit. In manzu, we have [1m] so we can draw two more to form a sequence (2 draws). Similarly, in pinzu: [2p] -> draw two to form a sequence (2 draws). In souzu: [3s] -> draw two to form a sequence (2 draws). \n\n      But wait, can we do better? Actually, we cannot form a triplet by drawing one because we don't have two of any. And we cannot form a sequence by drawing one because we don't have two consecutive in the same suit.\n\n      So two draws.\n\n      However, is there a way to form a mentsu in fewer than two draws? \n\n      Another example: [1m, 1m, 1m] -> already a triplet (0 draws).\n\n      Example: [1m, 1m, 2m] -> we can draw one 1m to make [1m,1m,1m] (koutsu) OR we can draw 3m to make [1m,2m,3m] (shuntsu). So one draw.\n\n      Example: [1m, 1m, 3m] -> we can draw 2m to complete the sequence [1m,2m,3m] (one draw) OR draw two more 1m to make a triplet (two draws). So the minimum is one.\n\n      Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> \n          Check for koutsu: none.\n          Check for shuntsu: \n            [1m,2m,3m] is missing 3m -> one draw (then we have [1m,2m,3m,4m] and the mentsu is [1m,2m,3m]).\n            [2m,3m,4m] is missing 3m -> one draw (same).\n\n          So one draw.\n\n      Example: [1m, 4m, 7m] -> no koutsu and no immediate sequence. \n          We can form a triplet by drawing two of one of these? But we have only one of each. So we would need two draws to make a triplet (for example, draw two 1m: then we have [1m,1m,1m] and the other two are 4m and 7m). But we can also form a sequence? \n\n          However, we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles: \n            For 1m: we can draw 2m and 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (but then we have [1m,2m,3m,4m,7m] -> that uses 1m and then 2m,3m are drawn, but we already have 1m and then 2m,3m are drawn so that's two draws.\n            Similarly, for 4m: draw 5m and 6m -> two draws.\n            Similarly, for 7m: draw 8m and 9m -> two draws.\n\n          So two draws.\n\n      But wait, is there a way to form a mentsu with one draw? \n          For koutsu: no, because we don't have two of the same.\n          For shuntsu: we need three consecutive. The existing tiles are 1,4,7. \n            We can try to complete a sequence with one draw: \n                For 1m: we can draw 2m to get [1m,2m] but then we don't have 3m, so we need to draw 3m as well. Similarly, we can't complete a sequence by one draw.\n\n          So no one-draw solution.\n\n      Therefore, the answer for [1m,4m,7m] is 2.\n\n   However, wait: what if we consider the possibility of forming a mentsu that doesn't use all the tiles? \n\n   Actually, the rules don't say we have to use all tiles. So we can ignore two of the tiles and form a mentsu from one or two tiles and the drawn ones.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to draw any tiles. So we can draw two tiles that form a mentsu with one of the existing ones, without using the other two.\n\n   Now, is it possible that we need more than two draws? \n\n   Consider: [1m, 2p, 3s] (three tiles, all different and in different suits). \n\n   We can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles: \n        We can draw two 1m to form a triplet [1m,1m,1m] (using the original 1m and two drawn 1m) -> two draws.\n\n   But wait, we can also form a sequence in any suit? We have one tile in each suit. \n\n   However, we can choose to form a triplet in manzu: draw two 1m (two draws). \n        Or form a sequence in manzu: from 1m, we can draw 2m and 3m (two draws). \n        Similarly for pinzu: from 2p, draw 1p and 3p (two draws) OR from 2p, we can also form [0p,1p,2p] but 0p is not allowed. So we can only form [1p,2p,3p] (if we have 2p, then we need 1p and 3p). \n        Similarly for souzu: from 3s, we can form [1s,2s,3s] (draw 1s,2s) OR [2s,3s,4s] (draw 2s,4s) but wait, we don't have 2s, so [1s,2s,3s] is the only possibility.\n\n   So two draws.\n\n   But note: we can also form a triplet from any of the existing tiles by drawing two of the same, so that's always two draws.\n\n   Therefore, the worst-case scenario (if the hand doesn't have any duplicates and no two consecutive in the same suit) requires two draws.\n\n   However, wait: what if we have two tiles that are the same? Then we don't need two draws for triplet, we can use one draw for triplet. But if they are same, then we might have a chance for one draw.\n\n   But what if we have two tiles that are the same and in the same suit, then we can form a triplet by drawing one more (so one draw). Also, if we have two tiles that are consecutive in the same suit, then we can form a sequence by drawing one.\n\n   Now, is it possible that we need three draws? \n\n   Let me think: \n\n   Example: [1m, 2m, 3p] -> \n        Already: no koutsu, no shuntsu (because shuntsu must be same suit). \n        One draw: \n            For koutsu: we can draw one 1m to have two 1m and then we need one more 1m for triplet? But we have two 1m and then we need one more? Actually, we have [1m,1m] (if we draw one 1m) then we can use the two 1m and the drawn 1m to form a triplet. So one draw.\n\n        But wait, we have two 1m? Actually, we have [1m, 2m, 3p] and we draw 1m: then we have [1m,1m,2m,3p]. Then we can form a triplet [1m,1m,1m] (but wait, we only drew one 1m, so we have two 1m and one 1m from the original? Actually, we started with one 1m. After drawing one 1m, we have two 1m. Then we don't have three 1m. \n\n        Correction: We have three tiles: [1m,2m,3p]. We draw one 1m -> now we have four tiles: [1m,1m,2m,3p]. Then we can form a triplet [1m,1m,1m] if we had drawn two 1m? \n\n        Actually, we only drew one. So we have two 1m. That is not a triplet. \n\n        Alternatively, we can form a sequence: we have [1m,2m] and then we can draw 3m to form [1m,2m,3m] (but wait, we have 3p, so we can ignore it). So we draw 3m and then we have [1m,2m,3m,3p] and we have a shuntsu [1m,2m,3m]. \n\n        But note: we are allowed to draw any tile. So to form a shuntsu, we can draw 3m. \n\n        So one draw.\n\n        Therefore, [1m,2m,3p] requires one draw.\n\n   Another example: [1m, 1m, 4m] (two 1m and one 4m). \n        One draw: \n            Triplet: we have two 1m, so we can draw one 1m to make three 1m -> that's a triplet (0 draws for the rest). So one draw.\n\n        Also, we can form a shuntsu: [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m and 3m (but that would be two draws) but we can also use the triplet.\n\n   So the minimal is one.\n\n   Now, what if we have [1m, 4m, 7m] (all different and not consecutive)? We saw that we need two draws.\n\n   But wait, is there a possibility to form a mentsu with three draws? \n\n   Actually, we don't need to consider more than two because:\n\n   - 0, 1, or 2 draws are the possibilities.\n\n   Why? Because we can always form a triplet by drawing two tiles (if we have at least one tile of a kind) or even if we have zero, we can draw three of the same (but that would be three draws). However, we can also form a triplet by drawing two if we have one. But if we have no tile, then we have to draw three to form a triplet? \n\n   However, note: we start with three tiles. We can break down the hand:\n\n   Let's count the frequency of each tile (each tile is represented by a string of two characters: e.g., '1m').\n\n   Possibilities:\n\n   - If we have three identical: 0 draws.\n\n   - Else, if we have two identical: then we can draw one more to complete the triplet (1 draw).\n\n   - Else, if we have two tiles that are consecutive and same suit: then we can complete the sequence with one draw (1 draw).\n\n   - Else, if we have one tile repeated twice? We already handled two identical. \n\n   But wait, what if we have three distinct tiles? Then we don't have two identical and no consecutive in the same suit.\n\n   Then we can consider:\n\n        Option: Draw two tiles to form a triplet: we can take any one tile and draw two of the same -> 2 draws.\n\n        Option: Draw two tiles to form a sequence: we can take one tile and draw two consecutive ones (for example, if we have tile X, then we can draw X-1 and X+1 to form [X-1, X, X+1] but note: we must have the same suit. So we can only do this if the tile is in a suit that allows consecutive numbers (from 1 to 9). \n\n        But note: we might have two different suits. However, we can choose one suit and then form a sequence in that suit.\n\n        However, we can also form a sequence from two tiles that are consecutive in the same suit (but we don't have any) so we don't have that. \n\n        But wait, we have three distinct tiles. They might be in the same suit? \n\n        Example: [1m, 2m, 4m] -> we have two consecutive (1m,2m) so that was handled by the consecutive condition (one draw). \n\n        So the case we are considering is when we have three distinct tiles and no two consecutive in the same suit.\n\n        Example: [1m, 3m, 5m] -> same suit, but no consecutive. Then we can form a sequence by drawing two tiles: \n            For the 1m: we can draw 2m and 3m? But wait, we already have 3m. Actually, we can form [1m,2m,3m] by drawing 2m (but then we have 1m,2m,3m and we ignore 5m). But wait, we have 3m already, so if we draw 2m, then we have [1m,2m,3m,5m] and the mentsu is [1m,2m,3m]. So actually, we don't need two draws, we need one draw.\n\n        But wait, the condition for consecutive was: we have two consecutive and same suit. In [1m,3m,5m], we don't have two consecutive. But we have 1m and 3m, which are not consecutive. \n\n        However, note: we can use the existing 3m to help form a sequence with 1m by drawing 2m. So the consecutive condition is not just having two consecutive, but also we can use one of the existing tiles to complete the sequence? \n\n        Actually, our previous condition for one draw for shuntsu was: we must have two tiles that are consecutive. But in [1m,3m,5m], we don't have two consecutive. \n\n        But we can form a sequence from 1m by drawing 2m (and then we have 1m,2m,3m) but wait, we already have 3m. So we don't need to draw 3m. So the condition for shuntsu by one draw is: having two consecutive numbers in the same suit, OR having one tile and the next one in the sequence (with a gap of one) and the next one is already present? \n\n        Actually, the definition of shuntsu is three consecutive. So to form a shuntsu with one draw, we must have two of the three consecutive. \n\n        In [1m,3m,5m]: \n            We have 1m and 3m: that's two numbers that are two apart. We can complete the sequence by drawing 2m (to make [1m,2m,3m]). So that's one draw.\n\n        But wait, we have 3m already. So we don't need to draw 3m, we just need to draw 2m. \n\n        Therefore, the condition for one draw for shuntsu is: \n            In the same suit, we have two tiles that are separated by one (like 1 and 3, or 2 and 4, etc.) and then we can draw the middle one. \n\n        But note: we must have the two tiles in the same suit and the two tiles must be such that they are consecutive in the sequence when the missing one is inserted.\n\n        Actually, the condition is: \n            We have two tiles (x, y) in the same suit such that |x-y| = 2, and then we can draw the tile (min(x,y)+1) to complete the sequence.\n\n        Similarly, we can have two tiles that are consecutive (difference 1) and then we can draw the next one (so the sequence becomes [x, x+1, x+2]) or the previous one (so the sequence becomes [x-1, x, x+1]). \n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify the order. The sequence [1m,2m,3m] is valid, but [3m,2m,1m] is the same set. \n\n        So to cover all cases for one draw for shuntsu:\n\n            Condition 1: There exists a suit and three numbers a, b, c (with a<b<c) such that {a, b, c} are consecutive and two of them are in the hand, and the third is missing. But note, we can draw the missing one.\n\n            However, we have three tiles. So we can have at most three tiles in one suit.\n\n            Actually, we can break down:\n\n            Let the hand be represented as a multiset. We are allowed to use any two tiles and then draw one.\n\n            But note: we might have two tiles in the same suit that are consecutive, then we can complete the sequence by drawing the next one. \n\n            Example: [1m,2m] -> draw 3m.\n\n            But also: [2m,3m] -> draw 1m or 4m? \n                Actually, [1m,2m,3m] is the standard sequence. But wait, [2m,3m,4m] is also a sequence. So we can complete by drawing 1m to form [1m,2m,3m] OR by drawing 4m to form [2m,3m,4m]. \n\n            Similarly, for [1m,3m] (same suit): we can draw 2m to form [1m,2m,3m]. \n\n            And for [2m,4m] (same suit): we can draw 3m to form [2m,3m,4m].\n\n            So the condition for one draw for shuntsu is: \n                There exists a suit and two tiles (a,b) (a<=b) in that suit such that the numbers are in the range [1,9] and the gap between the two is at most 2 (so that we can fill one gap to complete a consecutive triple). \n\n            More precisely: \n                Let the two numbers be x and y (x<=y) in the same suit. Then we require that y - x <= 2.\n\n            Why? \n                If y-x==0: then they are the same tile, but we already handled duplicates (for triplet) so we assume distinct.\n                If y-x==1: then we can complete the sequence by drawing either x-1 or y+1 (so two possibilities) but we only need one of them to be available (actually, we can draw either, so one draw suffices).\n                If y-x==2: then we can complete by drawing the middle one.\n\n            But note: if the two tiles are the same, we already considered triplet. So we are in the shuntsu part only when they are distinct.\n\n            However, wait: what if the two tiles are the same? Then we don't need to consider shuntsu. So we assume distinct.\n\n        So algorithm for one draw for shuntsu:\n\n            Group the tiles by suit.\n\n            For each suit, consider the set of distinct numbers (or maybe we should consider duplicates? Actually, we have three tiles, so duplicates are handled by triplet. Here we are looking for distinct numbers to form a sequence? \n\n            Actually, we can have duplicates, but if we have two same numbers in the same suit, then we can use one draw for triplet (if we have two) or if we have three, then we already have a triplet. But wait, if we have two same numbers, then we don't need to form a shuntsu by drawing one, because we can form a triplet. \n\n            So in the one-draw condition for shuntsu, we consider only the hands that do not have two identical tiles (because if they did, we would have chosen the triplet option). \n\n            However, note: we might have two identical tiles and also two consecutive in a different suit? \n\n            Actually, the conditions for koutsu and shuntsu are independent. \n\n            But the problem: we are trying to see if we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile. So if we have two identical tiles, then we can draw one more of that tile to complete the triplet (so koutsu). \n\n            So the one-draw condition for shuntsu must be checked only when there is no koutsu possibility (i.e., no two identical tiles) and also no koutsu (three identical) is already covered by two identical? \n\n            Actually, we have two identical tiles: then we can complete the triplet by drawing one. So the shuntsu condition is not needed if we have two identical.\n\n            Therefore, the one-draw conditions are:\n\n                Condition A: There exists a tile that appears at least two times (so we can draw one more to complete a triplet). \n                Condition B: There exists two tiles (distinct) in the same suit such that the absolute difference of their numbers is 1 (consecutive) OR 2 (with one gap). \n\n            But note: Condition B: the absolute difference being 1 or 2 is enough to complete a sequence by drawing one tile.\n\n            However, we must ensure that the two tiles are in the same suit.\n\n        Now, what about the boundaries? \n\n            Example: [9m,8m] -> difference 1, then we can draw 7m to form [7m,8m,9m] OR draw 10m? But 10m is not allowed. However, we can also form [8m,9m,10m] but 10m is invalid. \n\n            Actually, the rule: the tile numbers are from 1 to 9.\n\n            So for [9m,8m]: \n                We can form [7m,8m,9m] by drawing 7m (since 7 is between 8 and 9 and 7 is in the range [1,9]). \n                We cannot form [8m,9m,10m] because 10 is invalid.\n\n            Similarly, [1m,2m]: we can form [0m,1m,2m] (invalid) or [1m,2m,3m] (valid). So we can only form the latter.\n\n            Therefore, for two tiles (x,y) (x<y) in the same suit:\n\n                We can complete the sequence if:\n                    Option 1: Draw x-1 to form (x-1, x, y) but only if x-1 >= 1 and x+1 == y (so consecutive) then we can form (x-1,x,y) if x-1>=1, OR if y-x==2 then we can form (x,y,(x+1)) but wait, if y-x==2, then the sequence is (x, x+1, y) = (x, x+1, x+2). \n\n                Actually, we can complete the sequence in two ways:\n\n                    If we have (a, b) and we want to form a consecutive triple, we can try to extend to the left or to the right.\n\n                    Left extension: if a-1 == b-2? Not exactly.\n\n                    Let me define: \n                        We have two tiles: (a, b) with a <= b.\n\n                    Possibilities:\n\n                        1. The sequence is (a-2, a-1, a) if we have a and a-1 is missing and a-2 is missing? But we only draw one.\n\n                    Actually, we can only draw one tile. So the sequence must be one of:\n\n                        (a-1, a, b) if b == a+1 -> then we draw a-1, and we require a-1>=1.\n                        (a, b, b+1) if b == a+1 -> then we draw b+1, and we require b+1<=9.\n                        (a-1, a, a+1) if we have a and a+1, then we draw a-1 (if a-1>=1) OR (a, a+1, a+2) if we have a and a+1, then we draw a+2 (if a+2<=9). But wait, if we have (a, a+2) then we draw a+1.\n\n                    So for two tiles (a, b) (a<=b) in the same suit:\n\n                        Case 1: b == a+1 -> then we can complete the sequence by drawing a-1 (if a-1>=1) OR by drawing b+1 (if b+1<=9). So at least one of these is valid.\n\n                        Case 2: b == a+2 -> then we can complete the sequence by drawing a+1.\n\n                    But note: what if the two tiles are not consecutive and not with gap 2? Then we cannot complete with one draw.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for one draw for shuntsu is:\n\n                There exists a suit and two distinct numbers a, b (a<=b) such that:\n\n                    (b == a+1) OR (b == a+2)\n\n                and the drawn tile (the missing one) is in the range [1,9].\n\n            However, note: we might have more than two tiles in the same suit. \n\n            Example: [1m,2m,3m] -> already a shuntsu (0 draws). \n\n            Example: [1m,2m,4m] -> two consecutive (1m,2m) and then we can complete by drawing 3m (so one draw) OR we can complete by drawing 0m (invalid) or 5m (but that would be [2m,4m,5m] is not consecutive). So the condition above holds because (1,2) are consecutive.\n\n            Example: [1m,3m,4m] -> \n                In manzu: we have [1,3,4]. \n                We can look for two tiles: \n                    (1,3): gap 2 -> then we can complete by drawing 2 -> valid (2 is in [1,9])\n                    (1,4): gap 3 -> not allowed.\n                    (3,4): gap 1 -> then we can complete by drawing 2 (to form [2,3,4]) or 5 (to form [3,4,5]). Both are valid.\n\n            So the condition is satisfied.\n\n        Now, putting it all together:\n\n            Step 0: Parse the input.\n\n            Step 1: Check if we already have a mentsu (0 draws). \n                - Koutsu: any tile appears three times? (But we have only three tiles, so if there's a tile that appears three times, then yes). \n                - Shuntsu: any three tiles in the same suit that are consecutive (with step 1). \n\n            Step 2: Check if we can form a mentsu by drawing one tile (1 draw).\n\n                Condition A: There exists a tile that appears at least two times (so we can draw one more to complete a triplet).\n\n                Condition B: There exists a suit and two distinct numbers (a, b) (a<=b) such that:\n                    (b == a+1) OR (b == a+2)\n                    and the drawn tile (the missing one) is in the range [1,9].\n\n                However, note: Condition B must be applied only to the same suit and the two tiles must be in the same hand.\n\n            Step 3: If not, then check if we can form a mentsu by drawing two tiles (2 draws).\n\n                Then the answer is 2.\n\n            But wait, is 2 always the answer if we don't have 0 or 1? \n\n            However, we must consider: \n\n                We might form a triplet by drawing two of a tile",
