Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two integers n and x, then a list of n integers (the found cards)\n We can assume that there are infinitely many cards with any integer from -x to x (inclusive).\n\n The goal: find the minimum number of additional cards needed so that the total sum is zero.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Let S be the current sum of the found cards.\n 2. We need to add some cards (each card's value between -x and x) such that the total sum becomes 0.\n    So we need to achieve a total sum of -S (if the current sum is S, then we need to add numbers that sum to -S).\n\n 3. However, note that we can use any numbers in the range [-x, x] for the additional cards.\n\n 4. We are to minimize the number of additional cards.\n\n Observation:\n   We are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. Therefore, the maximum absolute value we can cancel per card is x.\n\n 5. We can think greedily:\n\n   Let target = -S (the amount we need to add)\n\n   Case 1: If target is 0, then we don't need to add any card -> answer 0.\n\n   Case 2: Otherwise, we need to cover the absolute value of the target by adding cards, but note that we can use both positive and negative.\n\n   However, note: we are not limited to just positive or negative. But observe:\n\n     We can use multiple cards. Each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value). But note: the sign matters.\n\n   Actually, we are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. So the problem reduces to: what is the minimum number of integers (each between -x and x) such that their sum is target (which could be positive or negative)?\n\n   But wait: we are free to choose any integers in [-x, x]. So we can also use negative numbers to reduce a positive target, etc.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not require that we use distinct cards, so we can use the same number multiple times.\n\n   Alternate approach:\n\n   Since each card can be at most x (in absolute value), the best way to cancel a large deficit is to use as many cards as possible with the maximum magnitude.\n\n   But note: if target is positive, we can only use positive cards? Not necessarily: we can use negative cards to cancel a positive target? Actually no: if target is positive, then we want to add positive numbers to get closer to zero (if our current sum is negative, then target is positive) but wait:\n\n   Let me clarify:\n\n     Current sum = S.\n     We need to add cards with total sum = -S.\n\n     If S is negative, then -S is positive -> we need to add positive numbers (or maybe a mix? but actually, we can also use negative numbers to cancel a positive target? No, because if we have a positive target (i.e., we need to add positive numbers) then using negative numbers would make the total even more negative. Similarly, if we have a negative target, we need negative numbers.\n\n   Actually, wait: the target is -S. So if S is negative, then -S is positive, meaning we need to add a positive total. Similarly, if S is positive, then -S is negative, meaning we need to add a negative total.\n\n   So we can only use positive cards to cover a positive deficit? Or negative cards for a negative deficit.\n\n   However, note: we can also use a combination. But observe: the problem is symmetric. So we can consider the absolute value of the target. Let T = abs(target) = abs(S).\n\n   Now, we need to cover T (positive) by adding cards that are either all positive (if T is positive) or all negative (if T is negative). But note: we can also use both? Actually, if we are trying to cover a positive T, we cannot use negative numbers because that would reduce the positive T we are trying to achieve. Similarly, for negative T, we cannot use positive.\n\n   However, wait: what if we use a mix? For example, if we need to cover a positive T, we can use some positive and some negative? Then the net positive must be T. But that doesn't help because we are constrained by the absolute value of each card. In fact, we can use negative numbers to adjust, but then we have to compensate with more positive numbers. This might not be minimal.\n\n   Actually, let's think:\n\n   We are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. We wish to minimize the number of cards.\n\n   The key is: the maximum absolute value we can add per card is x. Therefore, the minimum number of cards required to achieve a total of T (if T is positive) is at least ceil(T / x). Similarly, if T is negative, we use ceil(|T|/x).\n\n   However, wait: is it always ceil(T/x)? Consider:\n\n     Example: T = 10, x = 3.\n        With 4 cards: 3+3+3+1 -> but wait, we can use 1? Yes, because 1 is in [-3,3]. But wait, we are allowed to use any integer. So we can use 3,3,3,1 -> 10, but we used 4 cards.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use 3,3,3,3, -2? That would be 3*4 -2 = 12-2=10, but that uses 5 cards which is worse.\n\n        How about 3,3,4? Wait, 4 is not allowed because x=3. So we can only use integers from -3 to 3.\n\n        So we can use: 3,3,3,1 -> 4 cards.\n\n        But note: we can also use negative numbers in the middle? Actually, no, because we are trying to achieve a positive total of 10. Using a negative number would require even more positive numbers to compensate.\n\n        However, there is a better way: we can use as many 3's as possible and then adjust with one or two numbers.\n\n        The minimal number of cards for T=10 and x=3 is indeed ceil(10/3) = ceil(3.33) = 4.\n\n        But wait: 10/3 is about 3.33, so we need at least 4 cards.\n\n        Similarly, for T=9: 9/3=3, so 3 cards: three 3's.\n\n        What if T is not divisible by x? Then we need to use one extra card to adjust the remainder.\n\n        However, note: we can use negative numbers? Actually, we are only concerned with the absolute value. The problem is: we need to achieve exactly T (if T is positive) or -T (if negative) with the minimum number of cards, each card in [-x, x].\n\n        Actually, we can use negative cards to adjust the sum? Let me see:\n\n          Suppose we need to achieve T=7 with x=3.\n\n          Option 1: Use two cards: 3 and 4 -> but 4 is not allowed. So we can only use 3,3,1 -> 3+3+1=7 -> 3 cards. But ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3.\n\n          Option 2: Use three cards: 3,3,1 -> 7.\n\n          Is there a way with two cards? The maximum we can get from two cards is 6 (3+3). So no.\n\n        But wait, what if we use negative? For example, 3,3,1 is the best. \n\n        However, consider: what if T=8 with x=3?\n\n          Without negatives: 3+3+3 = 9 -> too big. Then we cannot use 3,3,2 because 2 is allowed? Then 3+3+2=8 -> 3 cards. ceil(8/3)=ceil(2.66)=3.\n\n        Now, what if T=2 with x=3? Then ceil(2/3)=1. And we can use one card: 2.\n\n        But wait, what if T=0? Then 0 cards.\n\n        However, there is a catch: sometimes we might be able to use fewer cards by mixing positive and negative? \n\n        Example: We have a current sum S = 5, so target T = -5 (negative). Then we need to add cards that sum to -5.\n\n        We can use one card: -5, if -5 is in [-x, x]? Only if x>=5. If x=3, then we cannot use -5. Then we have to use more cards.\n\n        How to compute the minimal number of cards for a given T (absolute value)?\n\n        We are allowed to use any integer in [-x, x]. We need to achieve a sum of T (if T is positive) or -T (if negative). But note: we can break T into a linear combination of numbers in [-x, x]. However, we are minimizing the number of terms.\n\n        Since we can use negative numbers, we can also overshoot and then correct? But that might not help because the absolute value constraint limits the overshoot.\n\n        Actually, we can use the following:\n\n        Let k be the number of cards. Then the maximum positive sum we can get with k cards is k*x (if we use all positive). The minimum is -k*x.\n\n        We need to achieve |T| (because the sign is taken care of by the requirement: if T is negative, we use negative cards, but note: we can also use a mix? Actually, wait: we are allowed to use both positive and negative arbitrarily. However, we are constrained by the fact that the total must be T.\n\n        But note: we can use both positive and negative to achieve a total of T. However, the minimal number of cards is still determined by the absolute value.\n\n        However, consider: if we are allowed to use both positive and negative, then we can also represent T as:\n\n          T = a1 + a2 + ... + ak, where each ai is in [-x, x]\n\n        We want to minimize k.\n\n        We know that the maximum absolute value we can represent with k cards is k*x. So we must have k*x >= |T|.\n\n        But is that sufficient? Not exactly, because we are constrained by the integers. However, note that we can choose any integers in [-x,x]. \n\n        Claim: The minimal k is the smallest integer such that k*x >= |T|.\n\n        Why? Because if we set k = ceil(|T| / x), then we can form T (if T is positive) by using:\n\n          Let k = ceil(|T|/x). Then we can use at most k*x (positive) or at least -k*x (negative). But we need exactly T.\n\n          How to form T? \n\n          We can use floor division: Let q = floor(|T| / x) and r = |T| % x.\n\n          Then we can use q cards of value x and then one card of value r (if r !=0). But wait, if T is positive, then we use positive numbers. But what if T is negative? Then we use negative numbers.\n\n          However, note: we can also use negative numbers to adjust? Actually, no: because if T is positive, we need positive adjustments. Similarly, for negative.\n\n        But wait, what if we are allowed to use negative numbers even for a positive T? Then we could use a mix. However, that would require more cards. For example, if T=5 and x=3, we can use:\n\n          Option 1: two cards: 3 and 2 -> 5 (if we use positive) -> but wait, 2 is allowed. Then k=2.\n\n          However, 5 = 3 + 2, so k=2, and 2*x=6 >=5 -> yes.\n\n          But ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2.\n\n        However, note: the above formula k = ceil(|T|/x) works because:\n\n          With k cards, the maximum absolute sum we can represent is k*x. Since we need to represent |T|, we must have k*x >= |T|. The minimal k is the smallest integer satisfying that.\n\n        But wait: is it always true that we can represent |T| with k cards if k*x >= |T|?\n\n          Actually, no: consider T=1, x=2. Then k=ceil(1/2)=1. Then we can represent 1 (using the card 1). So yes.\n\n          Consider T=2, x=2 -> k=ceil(2/2)=1. Then we can represent 2.\n\n          Consider T=3, x=2 -> ceil(3/2)=2. Then we can represent 3: 2+1=3.\n\n          Consider T=4, x=2 -> ceil(4/2)=2. Then 2+2=4.\n\n          Consider T=5, x=2 -> ceil(5/2)=3. Then 2+2+1=5.\n\n        So it seems we can always form T (with positive T) by using:\n\n          Let k = ceil(|T|/x). Then we can write:\n\n            Let base = x * (k-1)   [if we use k-1 cards of x, then the remaining T - base must be between -x and x? Actually, we need to form T.]\n\n          Actually, we can use k-1 cards of value x and then one card of value (T - x*(k-1)), provided that this last card is in [-x, x]. But note: T is positive and we are using k = ceil(T/x), so:\n\n            (k-1)*x < T <= k*x\n\n          Then T - (k-1)*x is at least 1 and at most x. So it is in [1, x] which is within [-x, x].\n\n        Similarly, for negative T, we can use k-1 cards of -x and then one card of value (-T - (-x)*(k-1)) = -T + (k-1)*x, and since k = ceil(|T|/x) = ceil(-T/x) (because T negative, so |T|=-T), we have:\n\n            (k-1)*x < -T <= k*x   => then -T - (k-1)*x is in [1, x] (positive) so the last card is negative? Actually, we want the total to be T (negative). \n\n          We can use k-1 cards of -x, then the total so far is -(k-1)*x, and we need to get to T. The remaining amount is T - (-(k-1)*x) = T + (k-1)*x.\n\n          Since T is negative, and k = ceil(|T|/x) = ceil(-T/x), we have:\n\n            (k-1)*x < -T <= k*x   => then T + (k-1)*x = (k-1)*x + T > (k-1)*x - (k*x) = -x   and <= (k-1)*x + (-x) + something? \n\n          Actually, let me check with an example: T=-5, x=3, then k=ceil(5/3)=2. Then the remaining amount is -5 + (2-1)*3 = -5+3 = -2. Then we use two cards: first card -3, second card -2 -> total -5.\n\n          So the formula holds.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of cards needed to achieve a total of T (in absolute value) is k = ceil(|T| / x).\n\n        But wait: what if T=0? Then k=ceil(0/x)=0.\n\n        However, note: we have two cases:\n\n          Case 1: T = 0 -> 0 cards.\n          Case 2: T != 0 -> k = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n        But wait: what if we are allowed to use negative numbers even when the target is positive? Then we can sometimes use fewer cards? \n\n        Example: Let T=1, x=2. Then k=ceil(1/2)=1. We can do 1.\n\n        Example: Let T=3, x=2. Then k=ceil(3/2)=2. We can do 2+1=3.\n\n        Example: Let T=4, x=2. Then k=ceil(4/2)=2. We can do 2+2=4.\n\n        Example: Let T=5, x=2. Then k=ceil(5/2)=3. We can do 2+2+1=5.\n\n        Example: Let T=6, x=2. Then k=ceil(6/2)=3. We can do 2+2+2=6.\n\n        Example: Let T=7, x=2. Then k=ceil(7/2)=4. We can do 2+2+2+1=7.\n\n        Now, consider: what if we are allowed to use negative numbers? Can we ever use fewer than ceil(|T|/x) cards? \n\n        Let's try: T=5, x=3. Then ceil(5/3)=2. But can we do 5 with two cards? The maximum we can get from two cards is 3+3=6, which is greater than 5. But we can also use negative? \n\n          Two cards: 3 and 2 -> 5, which is positive. But wait, 2 is allowed (<=3). So we don't need negative. \n\n        What if T=1, x=2? Then ceil(1/2)=1. One card: 1.\n\n        What if T=4, x=3? ceil(4/3)=2. Then we can do 3+1=4.\n\n        Now, consider T=2, x=3: ceil(2/3)=1. Then one card: 2.\n\n        But wait, what if T=3, x=3: ceil(3/3)=1. Then one card: 3.\n\n        However, consider T=2, x=1: ceil(2/1)=2. Then two cards: 1+1=2.\n\n        Now, consider a tricky one: T=0, x=any -> 0 cards.\n\n        But wait, the problem states: we can use any integer from -x to x. So we can also use zeros? \n\n        However, note: we are trying to achieve a specific total. Zeros don't change the total. So they are not useful unless we need to adjust the sign? Actually, if T is positive, then zeros don't help. Similarly, negative T.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of cards is indeed ceil(|T|/x).\n\n        However, wait: what if T is negative? We already said we can use negative cards. But note: the absolute value is the same.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: Read n and x.\n          Step 2: Read the list of n integers.\n          Step 3: Compute S = sum(list)\n          Step 4: Let T = -S   (we need to add cards that sum to T)\n          Step 5: Let abs_T = abs(T)\n\n          But wait: what if T is very large? However, note that the found cards are n cards, each with absolute value at most x, so the total sum S is at most n*x (if all positive) and at least -n*x (if all negative). Then T = -S is at most n*x and at least -n*x.\n\n          However, note: we are going to use ceil(|T| / x). But what if T is 0? Then 0.\n\n          But wait: what if T is not an integer? Actually, T is the negative of the sum of integers, so it is an integer.\n\n          Step 6: k = ceil(|T| / x)\n\n          However, note: if T is 0, then k=0.\n\n        But wait: let me test with the examples:\n\n          Example 1: Input \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\"\n            n=3, x=2, list=[-1,1,2]\n            S = -1+1+2 = 2\n            T = -2\n            abs_T = 2\n            k = ceil(2/2) = ceil(1) = 1 -> output 1. Matches.\n\n          Example 2: Input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\"\n            n=2, x=3, list=[-2,-2]\n            S = -4\n            T = 4\n            abs_T = 4\n            k = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.33) = 2 -> output 2. Matches.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is already zero? Then T=0, so k=0.\n\n        But wait: what if we are allowed to use negative numbers to cancel a positive T? We have shown that the minimal k is ceil(|T|/x). \n\n        However, there is a catch: sometimes we can use a combination of positive and negative to achieve a total that is closer to zero with fewer cards? \n\n        Let me reconsider: \n\n          We are trying to achieve a total of T (which is the amount we need to add). But note: the cards we add can be any integers in [-x, x]. \n\n          The key is: we are allowed to use any integers. So the problem is: represent T as a sum of integers each in [-x, x] with the minimum number of terms.\n\n          This is a classic problem. The minimal number of terms to represent T is:\n\n            If T==0: 0.\n            Else: \n              Let k_min = ceil(|T| / x)   [as above]\n\n          Why is that? Because the maximum absolute value per card is x, so we cannot do better than k_min. \n\n        Therefore, the answer is k_min.\n\n        But wait: what if T is negative? The same applies because we take absolute value.\n\n        However, wait: what if T is positive and we use a negative card? Then we have to compensate with more positive cards. That would require more cards, not less. So the minimal k is indeed ceil(|T|/x).\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          cards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          total_sum = sum(cards)\n          T = -total_sum\n          abs_T = abs(T)\n\n          # If T is 0, then we need 0 cards.\n          if abs_T == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              # k = ceil(|T| / x)\n              # How to compute ceil(a/b) for positive integers a and b?\n              # We can do: (abs_T + x - 1) // x   if we are doing integer ceiling division.\n\n              # But note: if abs_T is divisible by x, then ceil(abs_T/x) = abs_T//x, else abs_T//x + 1.\n\n              # Alternatively, we can use: (abs_T - 1) // x + 1\n\n              k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x   # This is integer ceiling division for positive numbers.\n\n              # However, note: abs_T and x are positive.\n\n              print(k)\n\n        Let me test with the examples:\n\n          Example 1: abs_T=2, x=2 -> (2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 (since 3//2 in integer division is 1) -> correct.\n\n          Example 2: abs_T=4, x=3 -> (4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3 = 2 -> correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if T is negative? We took absolute value, so it's the same.\n\n        But wait: what if T is negative and we use the same formula? It's the absolute value, so yes.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is positive, then T is negative. But we use |T|, so that's okay.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is negative? Then T is positive, and we use |T|, so that's okay.\n\n        However, there is a catch: what if the current sum is 0? Then T=0, and we print 0.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is 0, but we have to consider that we might be able to use negative or positive cards? No, because 0 is already achieved.\n\n        However, wait: what if the current sum is 0, but we are forced to use at least one card? No, the problem says \"minimum number of cards\", and if already 0 then 0.\n\n        But wait, consider: the problem says \"Vanya wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero\". He has found n cards. Then he can add more. So if the current sum is 0, then he doesn't need to add any.\n\n        Therefore, the above solution is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          t = -s\n          if t == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              # We need to represent t (which is non-zero) with cards in [-x, x]\n              # But note: t can be negative? We use absolute value.\n\n              # However, wait: what if t is negative? Then we need to represent a negative number. But the formula uses absolute value.\n\n              # The minimal number of cards is ceil(|t| / x)\n\n              # But note: the above integer ceiling division works for positive numbers.\n\n              # Since |t| is positive, we can do:\n\n              k = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x\n              print(k)\n\n        Let me test with an example from the problem: \n          Input: \"3 2\\n-1 1 2\" -> n=3, x=2, arr=[-1,1,2], s=2, t=-2, then |t|=2, k=(2+2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1 -> correct.\n\n        Another example: \n          Input: \"2 3\\n-2 -2\" -> n=2, x=3, arr=[-2,-2], s=-4, t=4, |t|=4, k=(4+3-1)//3 = (6)//3=2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait, consider a different example: \n          Example: n=1, x=10, card=[5] -> s=5, t=-5, |t|=5, k=(5+10-1)//10 = (14)//10=1 (since 14//10=1 in integer division). Correct.\n\n        However, wait: what if we have a negative current sum? \n          Example: n=1, x=10, card=[-5] -> s=-5, t=5, same as above.\n\n        But wait: what if the current sum is 7, and x=3. Then t=-7, |t|=7, k=(7+3-1)//3 = (9)//3=3. \n          Check: 3 cards: each at most 3. Maximum positive we can get is 9. We need 7. We can do 3+3+1=7 -> 3 cards. Correct.\n\n        However, wait: there is a known issue. \n\n        Alternate known approach from similar problems (like CodeForces): \n\n          The answer is the minimal k such that there exists integers a1, a2, ..., ak in [-x, x] and a1+a2+...+ak = T.\n\n          Conditions: k*x >= |T|\n\n          But is that sufficient? \n\n          Actually, the necessary and sufficient condition is that k*x >= |T| and k>= ceil(|T|/x). \n\n          However, we have shown that k = ceil(|T|/x) is sufficient.\n\n        But wait: what if T is 1, x=2? Then k=ceil(1/2)=1, and 1*2>=1 -> holds.\n\n        However, consider T=1, x=1: then k=ceil(1/1)=1, and 1>=1 -> holds.\n\n        But consider T=1, x=2: we can use 1 (which is <=2) so yes.\n\n        But wait: what if T=1, x=1? Then we can use 1.\n\n        Now, consider T=3, x=2: ceil(3/2)=2, and 2*2=4>=3 -> holds.\n\n        However, note that we are representing T with k cards. The representation is:\n\n          We can use at most k*x and at least -k*x.\n\n          But we need to represent T. The condition k*x>=|T| is necessary. \n\n          But is it sufficient? \n\n          We can use the following greedy algorithm:\n\n            Let k = ceil(|T|/x)\n\n            Then, we can use floor(|T|/x) cards of x (if T positive) and then one card of (|T| mod x) if the remainder is non-zero, but wait: if the remainder is non-zero, then we use one more card. But note: we are using k cards.\n\n          Actually, we can use:\n\n            Let k = ceil(|T|/x)\n\n            Then, we can represent T as:\n\n              If T is positive: \n                Use (k-1) cards of x and one card of (T - (k-1)*x). Since (k-1)*x < T <= k*x, then T - (k-1)*x is between 1 and x (inclusive). So the last card is in [1, x] which is allowed.\n\n              Similarly, for negative T: \n                Use (k-1) cards of -x and one card of (T + (k-1)*x). Again, T + (k-1)*x is between -x and x (because (k-1)*x < |T| <= k*x, so T + (k-1)*x is between -x and x).\n\n          Therefore, the representation is always possible.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is k = ceil(|T|/x).\n\n        However, wait: what if T is negative and we are using positive cards? \n\n          Actually, we use negative cards for negative T.\n\n        But wait: the representation for negative T: we use negative numbers. The above reasoning for negative T is:\n\n          T is negative, so we use negative cards. We use k-1 cards of -x and then one card of (T + (k-1)*x). \n\n          Example: T=-5, x=3, k=ceil(5/3)=2.\n\n          Then we use 1 card of -3, and the last card is -5 + (1)*3 = -2. Then total = -3 + (-2) = -5.\n\n        So the representation is valid.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          t = -s\n          if t == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              # Calculate k = ceil(|t| / x)\n              # Since |t| is positive, we can do:\n              abs_t = abs(t)\n              # Ceiling division: (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n              k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n              print(k)\n\n        However, wait: what if t is negative? We took absolute value, so it's the same.\n\n        But wait: there's an alternative representation for negative t? Actually, we can use positive cards to cancel a negative t? \n\n          Example: t = -5, then we need to add cards that sum to -5. We cannot use positive cards because that would make the total even more negative? Actually, no: we need to add -5. \n\n          But wait: the problem is: we are allowed to use any card from -x to x. So we can use negative cards to get -5. \n\n          However, what if we use positive cards? Then we are increasing the total (from the found cards) by positive numbers, which would require even more negative cards to cancel. \n\n          Actually, the goal is to make the entire set (found + added) sum to zero. \n\n          Initially, the found cards sum to s. Then we add cards that sum to t (which is -s). \n\n          We are free to choose the added cards arbitrarily (any integers in [-x, x]). \n\n          But note: the problem does not require that the added cards are all positive or all negative. However, we are trying to minimize the number of cards.\n\n          We can use a mix? \n\n          Example: s=3, so t=-3. We can use one card: -3. Or we can use two cards: -2 and -1. But that's two cards, which is worse. \n\n          But wait: what if we use a mix for a larger T? \n\n          Example: T=5, x=3. We can use two cards: 3 and 2 (positive) -> total 5. Or we can use two cards: 3 and 2 (same). \n\n          Now, consider T=4, x=3. We can use two cards: 3 and 1 (positive) -> 4. Or we can use one card: 4? But 4 is not allowed (since x=3). \n\n          Now, consider T=-4, x=3. We can use two cards: -3 and -1 -> total -4. Or one card: -4? Not allowed.\n\n          Now, consider T=1, x=2. One card: 1.\n\n          Now, consider T=0, x=anything -> 0.\n\n          Now, consider T=3, x=2. Then ceil(3/2)=2. We can do 2+1=3.\n\n          But wait: can we do 3 in one card? No, because 3>2 (if x=2, then maximum is 2). \n\n          Now, consider T=2, x=3: ceil(2/3)=1. One card: 2.\n\n          Now, consider T=2, x=2: ceil(2/2)=1. One card: 2.\n\n          Now, consider T=3, x=3: ceil(3/3)=1. One card: 3.\n\n          Now, consider T=4, x=3: ceil(4/3)=2. Two cards: 3+1=4.\n\n          Now, consider T=5, x=3: ceil(5/3)=2. But wait, two cards: maximum is 3+3=6, which is >=5. Then we can do 3+2=5. So two cards.\n\n          But wait: 5//3=1, so ceil(5/3)=2. Correct.\n\n          Now, consider T=6, x=3: ceil(6/3)=2. Two cards: 3+3=6.\n\n          Now, consider T=7, x=3: ceil(7/3)=ceil(2.33)=3. Three cards: 3+3+1=7.\n\n          Now, consider T=8, x=3: ceil(8/3)=ceil(2.66)=3. Three cards: 3+3+2=8.\n\n          Now, consider T=9, x=3: ceil(9/3)=3. Three cards: 3+3+3=9.\n\n          Now, consider T=10, x=3: ceil(10/3)=4. Four cards: 3+3+3+1=10.\n\n        So the formula holds.\n\n        However, wait: what if T is negative and we use positive cards? \n\n          Example: T=-5, x=3. We need to add cards that sum to -5. \n\n          We cannot use positive cards because that would increase the total (which is already 5 too high, i.e., we have a deficit of -5). \n\n          But wait: the current sum is s, and we need to add t = -s. If s=5, then t=-5.\n\n          We are allowed to use any card. We can use positive cards? Then we are making the total even more positive? Then we would have to add even more negative cards. \n\n          Actually, the goal is to make the total zero. So if the current total is 5, we need to add -5. \n\n          We can use negative cards. \n\n          But note: the problem does not restrict the sign of the added cards. \n\n          However, the minimal number of cards is still ceil(|T|/x). \n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n          n, x = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          s = sum(arr)\n          t = -s\n          if t == 0:\n              print(0)\n          else:\n              abs_t = abs(t)\n              k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n              print(k)\n\n        But wait: wait, wait, wait!\n\n        There is a flaw: \n\n          In the example: Input \"2 3\\n-2 -2\", we computed k=2. \n\n          But what if we use two cards: one positive and one negative? \n\n          We need to add two cards that sum to 4 (because t=4). \n\n          We can use two cards",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all the numbers on his found cards equals zero. Each card can have any integer value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key observation here is that the sum of the found cards must be zero after adding the new cards. The sum of the new cards should therefore be the negation of the current sum of the found cards. The challenge is to find the smallest number of cards (each with a value between -x and x) that sum up to this required value.\n\n2. **Insight**: The minimal number of cards needed is determined by the ceiling of the absolute value of the required sum divided by the maximum absolute value of a card (x). This is because each card can contribute at most x (in absolute value) towards reducing the deficit. \n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Calculate the total sum of the found cards.\n   - Determine the target sum (T) which is the negative of this total.\n   - If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n   - Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards as the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by x. This is efficiently calculated using integer arithmetic: `(abs(T) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    s = sum(arr)\n    t = -s\n    if t == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        abs_t = abs(t)\n        k = (abs_t + x - 1) // x\n        print(k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of a card). The second line reads the list of integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum (`t`) is the negative of this sum, which needs to be achieved by adding new cards.\n3. **Target Sum Check**: If the target sum is zero, it means no additional cards are needed, so the answer is zero.\n4. **Card Count Calculation**: For a non-zero target sum, the minimal number of cards required is calculated by taking the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by `x`. This is done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.\n5. **Output Result**: The result is printed, which is the minimal number of cards needed to make the total sum zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging mathematical insight and integer arithmetic to minimize the number of operations and ensure correctness.",
