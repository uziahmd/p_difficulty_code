He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S of length between 1 and 5000, consisting of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (because A appended some 'b' and B is guaranteed to have at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n 2. The string must be split into three parts: \n    - First part: only 'a's (from A)\n    - Second part: only 'b's (from B)\n    - Third part: only 'c's (from C) but note that the entire string might not have all three? Actually, the problem says:\n        - A gives a string of some 'a's.\n        - Then B appends some 'b's (so now the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n        - Then C appends some 'c's (so the string must end with 'c's). However, note that it is possible that there are no 'c's? But wait: the problem says \"some number\" meaning at least one? Actually, the problem says \"appends some number\", which can be zero? But note: condition for C: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. If there are no 'c's, then we require 0 == count('a') or 0 == count('b'). Since we already have at least one 'a' and one 'b', then if there are no 'c's, then 0 != count('a') and 0 != count('b'), so that fails. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'? Not necessarily: the problem says C appends some number (which can be zero). But wait, the condition says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\". Note: the string at the moment C gets it includes the original 'a's and the appended 'b's. So the total counts of 'a' and 'b' are fixed when C appends. However, if C appends 0 'c's, then we require 0 == count('a') or 0 == count('b') -> which is impossible because we have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So indeed, the string must have at least one 'c' if C appends at least one, but wait: what if C appends 0? Then the condition fails because 0 is not equal to the count of 'a' (which is at least 1) nor the count of 'b' (which is at least 1). Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"C appends some number of letters 'c'\", and the condition is about the number of 'c' being equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b' in the string at the time of appending. But wait, the string at the time of appending by C is the string after B's operation. In that string, the counts of 'a' and 'b' are fixed. Then C appends n 'c's where n is either the total 'a' (which was originally from A) or the total 'b' (from B). But note: the entire string after B's operation is the initial 'a's (say x) and the appended 'b's (say y). Then C appends n 'c's where n is either x or y.\n\n However, note: the entire string after C's operation is the original string (from A and B) plus the 'c's. The condition does not say that the entire string must have the counts as specified, but the number of 'c's appended is equal to x or y. And the entire string must be in the order: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's? Actually, the problem states:\n\n   - A gives a string of 'a's.\n   - B appends 'b's to the end.\n   - C appends 'c's to the end.\n\n So the final string must be non-decreasing in the sense: all 'a's (if any) then all 'b's (if any) then all 'c's (if any). \n\n Therefore, the string must be such that:\n   - It starts with some 'a's (at least one), then some 'b's (at least one), then some 'c's (at least one) [because if there were no 'c's, the condition would fail as explained].\n\n But wait: what if the string does not have the three parts in order? For example, if we see an 'a' after a 'b', that breaks the condition. Similarly, if we see a 'b' after a 'c', that's invalid.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check the order: the string must be in the form of a sequence of 'a's (possibly empty? but we know at least one 'a' from A and one 'b' from B, so we have at least one 'a' and one 'b'), then sequence of 'b's, then sequence of 'c's. There should be no other characters.\n\n 2. Let:\n     count_a = number of 'a' in the entire string (but wait: the entire string? Actually, the initial part is all 'a's, so the entire string's 'a' is the initial part. Similarly for 'b' and 'c'.)\n\n 3. Conditions on counts:\n     - The number of 'c's must be either the total number of 'a's (i.e., the initial part's 'a') OR the total number of 'b's (i.e., the part appended by B).\n\n 4. However, note: the total number of 'b's is the entire string's 'b's because B appends only 'b's and then C appends 'c's. Similarly, the entire string's 'a' is the initial part.\n\n But wait: what if there are no 'c's? Then we already said the condition fails. So the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the string is given and we have to check if it is possible. So we assume the string is built by the described process.\n\n But note: the example input includes strings that might not be in order, like 'bbacc' -> which is NO.\n\n So algorithm:\n\n Step 1: Check the order. We traverse the string and make sure that once we leave 'a's, we never see an 'a' again. Similarly for 'b's: once we leave 'b's, we never see a 'b' again.\n\n Example: \n   'aaabccc': valid order (a's then b's then c's)\n   'bbacc': \n        starts with 'b' -> but we are supposed to have at least one 'a' at the beginning? Actually, the process requires that A gives a string of 'a's, then B appends 'b's. So the string must start with at least one 'a'. Therefore, if the first character is 'b', then we break the condition.\n\n But wait: the problem states that A has a string of 'a's, then B appends 'b's. So the first character must be 'a'. Therefore, the string must start with 'a'. Then we can have a block of 'a's, then a block of 'b's, then a block of 'c's.\n\n However, consider: what if the string is \"abc\"? \n   - Count_a = 1, count_b = 1, count_c = 1 -> then the condition for C: the number of 'c' (which is 1) must be equal to the number of 'a' (1) OR the number of 'b' (1). Both hold. So \"abc\" is valid.\n\n But wait: the example input also includes 'aabc' (which is \"aab\" then 'c')? Actually, the example input is ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'].\n\n Let me break down the example 'aabc':\n\n   Original string from A: \"aa\" (two 'a's)\n   Then B appends one 'b' -> becomes \"aab\"\n   Then C appends some 'c's: the number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a' (which is 2) OR the number of 'b' (which is 1). Since 1 is one of them, he appends 1 'c'. So the string becomes \"aabc\".\n\n However, note the entire string has two 'a's, one 'b', one 'c'. But the condition for C is checked on the string before appending: that string is \"aab\", so the number of 'a' is 2, the number of 'b' is 1. Then C appends 1 'c' (because 1 is the number of 'b').\n\n So the condition is: \n   Let n = count of 'a' in the string (before C appends) is the initial part, and m = count of 'b' in the string (before C appends) is the part from B.\n\n   Then the number of 'c' appended is either n or m.\n\n   But note: the entire string after C's appending is the original string (with counts n and m) and then k 'c's, so the total 'c' is k.\n\n   And k must be either n or m.\n\n However, in the example \"aabc\": \n   Before C appends, the string is \"aab\": \n        n = count('a') = 2, m = count('b') = 1.\n   Then k = 1 (the number of 'c' in the final string) must be either 2 or 1 -> yes.\n\n But note: the entire string has two 'a's, one 'b', one 'c'. The condition is defined on the state when C receives the string (which is \"aab\") so the counts of 'a' and 'b' are taken from that.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" \n\n The string at the time of C's operation is the one without the 'c's. So the condition is based on the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the current string (which is the string after B).\n\n Therefore, we can break the string into three segments:\n\n   Segment1: all consecutive 'a's at the beginning (must exist, and then no more 'a' later)\n   Segment2: all consecutive 'b's (must exist, and then no more 'b' later)\n   Segment3: all consecutive 'c's (if there are any)\n\n But note: the problem does not say that the string must have all three. However, from the condition on the counts, we must have at least one 'c' (since the number of 'c' must be either the number of 'a' (>=1) or the number of 'b' (>=1)), so the segment3 must exist (unless the number of 'a' or 'b' is zero, but we are guaranteed at least one 'a' and one 'b' from the problem statement). Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\n However, wait: what if the string does not have any 'c'? Then the condition fails. So we can check:\n\n   - The string must start with at least one 'a'\n   - Then at least one 'b'\n   - Then at least one 'c'\n\n But note: the problem states that C appends some number of 'c's, and that number must be equal to the number of 'a' or 'b' in the string (which has at least one 'a' and one 'b'). So the number of 'c' is at least 1 (if the number of 'a' is 1 then one 'c'; if the number of 'b' is 1 then one 'c').\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check the order: \n      We can traverse and ensure that the string is divided into three contiguous blocks: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\n 2. Count the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the entire string? Actually, we need the counts of 'a' and 'b' from the string before C appends. But note: the entire string is built by A, B, and C. However, the condition for C is applied on the string that is the result of A and B. So the counts of 'a' and 'b' in the entire string (after C) are the same as the counts in the string from A and B, because C only appends 'c's.\n\n 3. Let:\n        total_a = count of 'a' in the entire string (which is the same as the initial part)\n        total_b = count of 'b' in the entire string (which is the same as the part appended by B)\n        total_c = count of 'c' in the entire string\n\n 4. Condition: total_c must be either total_a or total_b.\n\n However, wait: the condition says that the number of 'c' appended is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b' in the string (at the time of C's operation). The string at the time of C's operation is the string without the 'c's. So the number of 'a' in that string is total_a, and the number of 'b' in that string is total_b. Therefore, we require:\n\n        total_c == total_a   OR   total_c == total_b\n\n 5. But note: the entire string must be in the form of three contiguous blocks.\n\n Example: \n   Input: \"aaabccc\" -> \n        total_a = 3, total_b = 1, total_c = 3 -> 3==3 OR 3==1 -> YES.\n\n   Input: \"bbacc\" -> \n        This string does not have the correct order: \n            It starts with 'b', then 'b', then 'a' -> which breaks the order (we should not have an 'a' after 'b' and then a 'c').\n\n        So we output NO.\n\n   Input: \"aabc\" -> \n        total_a = 2, total_b = 1, total_c = 1 -> 1==2? no, 1==1? yes -> YES.\n\n 6. However, what if the string is \"aaccc\"? \n        This is: two 'a's, then one 'b'? Wait, no: the string is \"aaccc\". \n        According to the process, the string should be: \n          Start with 'a's (here \"aa\"), then 'b's (here none? but the problem says B appends some number of 'b's, so at least one). Therefore, we must have at least one 'b'. So this string is invalid because there is no 'b'. \n\n        But wait, our condition step 1: check the order. The string \"aaccc\" is: \n          It starts with 'a's, then we have no 'b's? Then we go to 'c's. However, the problem says that B appends some number of 'b's (meaning at least one). So the string must have at least one 'b'. Therefore, we must also check that the block of 'b's exists (i.e., total_b >= 1). \n\n        Similarly, the problem says that A gives at least one 'a', so total_a>=1.\n\n 7. Therefore, we must check:\n\n        - The string must start with one or more 'a's (so total_a>=1)\n        - Then one or more 'b's (so total_b>=1)\n        - Then one or more 'c's (so total_c>=1)\n\n        And the entire string must be composed of these three blocks.\n\n        And the condition: total_c == total_a or total_c == total_b.\n\n 8. How to check the order?\n\n        We can do:\n\n        i = 0\n        # Count consecutive 'a's\n        while i < len(S) and S[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n        # Now from i to next change: we expect only 'b's\n        j = i\n        while j < len(S) and S[j]=='b':\n            j += 1\n        # Then from j to end: we expect only 'c's\n        k = j\n        while k < len(S) and S[k]=='c':\n            k += 1\n\n        If we reached the end (k==len(S)) and the counts are as above, then the order is correct.\n\n        But note: we must have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. \n\n        Alternatively, we can check:\n\n        if S contains any character other than 'a','b','c': but the input guarantees only those.\n\n        Then, we can check that the string does not contain the pattern: \n          - Any 'a' after a non-'a' (which means after a 'b' or 'c')\n          - Any 'b' after a non-'b' (after an 'a' or 'c')? But wait, the process doesn't allow mixing.\n\n        However, the above loop method is straightforward.\n\n 9. But note: what if the string does not have a 'b' block? Then the second while loop will break immediately, and then we'll have a third while loop that goes from the current position (which is the end of the first block) to the end, and then we check if we consumed the whole string? \n\n        Example: \"aac\" -> \n            First block: \"aa\" -> i=2\n            Second block: from index2: 'c' -> so the second while loop doesn't run (because 'c' != 'b') -> so j=2\n            Then third block: from index2: 'c' -> so k becomes 3 (end) -> so the entire string is processed.\n\n        However, we must have at least one 'b'. So we can check:\n\n            if the first block ends at i, then the next block must be non-empty and consist of 'b's, and then the last block must be non-empty and consist of 'c's.\n\n        Actually, the problem states that B appends some number of 'b's (at least one) and C appends some number of 'c's (at least one, because the condition requires that the number of 'c' is either the count of 'a' (>=1) or the count of 'b' (>=1)). \n\n        Therefore, we must have:\n\n            total_b >= 1 and total_c >= 1.\n\n        Also, the entire string must be split as above.\n\n 10. Algorithm:\n\n        Read S.\n\n        Step 1: Check that the string has at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. (But note: the condition for the counts of 'c' being either the count of 'a' or 'b' implies that if the string has no 'c', then the condition fails. But we are also going to check the order.)\n\n        However, we can do:\n\n        Let:\n            a_count = 0\n            b_count = 0\n            c_count = 0\n\n        But we don't need to count the entire string, we just need to check the order and then the counts.\n\n        Step 2: Traverse to split the string.\n\n        Let:\n            i = 0\n            n = len(S)\n\n            # Count consecutive 'a's\n            while i < n and S[i]=='a':\n                i += 1\n\n            # Now, from i to j: consecutive 'b's\n            j = i\n            while j < n and S[j]=='b':\n                j += 1\n\n            # Now, from j to k: consecutive 'c's\n            k = j\n            while k < n and S[k]=='c':\n                k += 1\n\n            # Now, if k != n, then there are invalid characters.\n\n        Step 3: If k != n, then the string has invalid characters (like an 'a' after a 'b' or a 'b' after a 'c', etc.) -> then NO.\n\n        Step 4: Check that we have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. \n\n            If i (the count of 'a') is 0 -> no 'a' -> invalid (but the problem says A has at least one 'a')\n            If j-i (the count of 'b') is 0 -> no 'b' -> invalid (B appends at least one 'b')\n            If k-j (the count of 'c') is 0 -> no 'c' -> invalid (then the condition for C fails because the number of 'c' would be 0, which is not equal to the count of 'a' (>=1) or the count of 'b' (>=1))\n\n        Step 5: Then, the total number of 'c' is k-j, and we require that (k-j) == (i) or (k-j) == (j-i). \n\n        However, note: the counts for the condition of C are taken from the string before appending 'c's. That string is the substring S[0:k] (without the trailing 'c's). But wait, the counts of 'a' and 'b' in that string are the same as the entire string's 'a' and 'b' because the 'c's are appended at the end. So:\n\n            total_a = i   (number of 'a' in the entire string)\n            total_b = j - i   (number of 'b' in the entire string)\n\n        Then the condition is: (k-j) == i or (k-j) == (j-i)\n\n        Example: \"aabc\": \n            i=2 (because two 'a's: indices0 and 1)\n            j=3 (because at index2 we have 'b', then index3 is 'c' so we break the 'b' loop)\n            k=4 (entire string)\n\n            total_a = 2, total_b = 1, total_c = 1.\n\n            Condition: 1==2 -> False, 1==1 -> True -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaabccc\":\n            i=3 (three 'a's)\n            j=4 (one 'b')\n            k=7 (three 'c's)\n            total_a=3, total_b=1, total_c=3 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"abc\": \n            i=1, j=2, k=3 -> total_a=1, total_b=1, total_c=1 -> 1==1 -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"abbccc\": \n            i=1, j=3 (because two 'b's: indices1 and 2), k=6 (three 'c's)\n            total_a=1, total_b=2, total_c=3 -> 3==1? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n        But wait: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' (which is 1) OR the number of 'b' (which is 2). Here, 3 is neither 1 nor 2 -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"abbcc\": \n            i=1, j=3, k=5 -> total_a=1, total_b=2, total_c=2 -> 2==1? no, 2==2? yes -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aabbcc\": \n            i=2, j=4 (two 'b's), k=6 (two 'c's)\n            Condition: 2==2 (for 'a')? no, 2==2 (for 'b')? yes -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aabbccc\": \n            i=2, j=4, k=7 -> total_c=3\n            Condition: 3==2? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n        Example: \"aabbcc\": YES, \"aabbccc\": NO.\n\n 11. Edge cases:\n\n        - String length 1: \"a\" -> but then we must have at least one 'b' and one 'c'? -> fails the order and the counts. So \"a\" -> NO.\n\n        - String length 2: \"ab\": \n            i=1, j=2, k=2 -> no 'c' (k-j=0) -> fails the condition that there must be at least one 'c' (because the condition requires the number of 'c' to be either the number of 'a' (which is 1) or the number of 'b' (which is 1) -> so we need 1 'c'. But here we have 0 -> NO.\n\n        - String length 3: \"abc\" -> YES.\n\n        - String with no 'c' at all: then k-j=0 -> then we check: 0 == i (which is >=1) or 0 == (j-i) (which is >=1) -> false -> NO.\n\n        - String with no 'b' at all: then j-i=0 -> then we break the condition (B appends at least one 'b') -> NO.\n\n        - String with no 'a' at all: then i=0 -> NO.\n\n        But note: the problem states that A gives a string of 'a's (so at least one) and B appends some 'b's (at least one). So the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Then C appends at least one 'c' (because the condition requires the number of 'c' to be at least one). So the minimal string is \"abc\".\n\n 12. Code structure:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # If the string is empty, then no, but n>=1.\n\n        i = 0\n        # Count 'a's\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n\n        j = i\n        # Count 'b's\n        while j < n and s[j]=='b':\n            j += 1\n\n        k = j\n        # Count 'c's\n        while k < n and s[k]=='c':\n            k += 1\n\n        # Now, if we haven't traversed the entire string, then there's an invalid character or transition.\n        if k != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Check that we have at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'\n        if i == 0 or j-i == 0 or k-j == 0:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        total_a = i\n        total_b = j - i\n        total_c = k - j\n\n        if total_c == total_a or total_c == total_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n 13. Let's test with provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"aaabccc\" -> \n            i=3, j=4, k=7 -> \n            total_a=3, total_b=1, total_c=3 -> 3==3 -> YES.\n\n        Example 2: \"bbacc\" -> \n            This string: \n                First char is 'b' -> so i=0 (no 'a') -> then we break the first while. Then j=0, then we look for 'b's: we have \"bb\" -> j becomes 2. Then we look for 'c's: at index2: 'a' -> so the third while breaks at k=2. Then k != n (n=5) -> invalid order -> NO.\n\n        Example 3: \"aabc\" -> \n            i=2, j=3, k=4 -> \n            total_a=2, total_b=1, total_c=1 -> 1==2? no, 1==1? yes -> YES.\n\n        Example 4: \"abc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example 5: \"aabbcc\" -> \n            i=2, j=4, k=6 -> total_a=2, total_b=2, total_c=2 -> 2==2 (for a) -> YES.\n\n        Example 6: \"abbccc\" -> \n            i=1, j=3, k=6 -> total_a=1, total_b=2, total_c=3 -> 3!=1 and 3!=2 -> NO.\n\n        Example 7: \"aabbcc\" is YES, but note: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' (which is 2) OR the number of 'b' (which is 2). 2==2 -> YES.\n\n        Example 8: \"aabbc\" -> \n            i=2, j=4, k=5 -> total_a=2, total_b=2, total_c=1 -> 1==2? no, 1==2? no -> NO.\n\n        Example 9: \"aaaccc\" -> \n            i=3, j=3 (no 'b') -> then j-i=0 -> invalid (we require at least one 'b') -> NO.\n\n        Example 10: \"cc\" -> \n            i=0, j=0, k=2 -> then k != n? Actually, the entire string is 'cc', so k becomes 2 and n=2 -> k==n. Then we check: i=0 -> invalid (no 'a') -> NO.\n\n        Example 11: \"aab\" -> \n            i=2, j=3 (because the string is \"aab\", so two 'a's and one 'b') -> then k=3 (no 'c') -> then k-j=0 -> invalid (no 'c') -> NO.\n\n        Example 12: \"aba\" -> \n            This string: \n                First while: i=1 (because first char 'a', then next is 'b')\n                Then j: from index1, we see 'b', then next is 'a' -> so j stops at index1 (so j-i=1)\n                Then k: from index1, we try to read 'c's? but the next is 'a' -> so k remains 1 -> then k != n (n=3) -> NO.\n\n        Example 13: \"acb\" -> \n            First while: i=1 (only one 'a')\n            Then j: from index1: 'c' -> so j remains 1 -> then k: from index1: 'c' -> then k becomes 2, then at index2: 'b' -> break. Then k=2, n=3 -> not the entire string -> NO.\n\n        This matches.\n\n 14. However, note: what if the string has no 'c' block? Then k-j=0, and we already check that (k-j==0) and also that the entire string is processed (k==n). So if k==n, then we processed the whole string. But if k-j==0, then the string ends without any 'c's? Actually, no: if k==n, then we processed the entire string as three blocks, but the third block is empty (if k==j, then no 'c').\n\n        We have:\n\n            if k != n: then invalid.\n\n            Then we check if i==0 or j-i==0 or k-j==0 -> then NO.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n 15. But wait: what if the string is \"abbbc\" (one 'a', three 'b's, one 'c')?\n\n        total_a=1, total_b=3, total_c=1 -> 1==1 (for 'a') -> YES.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n 16. Another example: \"aabbccc\" (already done) -> NO.\n\n 17. One more: \"aabbcc\" (already done) -> YES.\n\n 18. Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" (four 'a's, three 'b's, four 'c's) -> \n        Condition: 4==4 (for 'a') -> YES.\n\n 19. Example: \"aaaabbbcc\" (four 'a's, three 'b's, two 'c's) -> \n        Condition: 2==4? no, 2==3? no -> NO.\n\n 20. Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" (four 'a's, three 'b's, three 'c's) -> \n        Condition: 3==4? no, 3==3? yes -> YES.\n\n 21. Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" (four 'a's, three 'b's, four 'c's) -> \n        Condition: 4==4 -> YES.\n\n 22. Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" (four 'a's, three 'b's, three 'c's) -> YES.\n\n 23. Example: \"aaaabbbcc\" (four 'a's, three 'b's, two 'c's) -> NO.\n\n 24. Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" (four 'a's, three 'b's, four 'c's) -> YES.\n\n 25. Example: \"aaaabbbcc\" (four 'a's, three 'b's, two 'c's) -> NO.\n\n 26. Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" (four 'a's, three 'b's, three 'c's) -> YES.\n\n 27. Example: \"aaaabbbcccc\" (four 'a's, three 'b's, four 'c's) -> YES.\n\n 28. Example: \"aaaabbbccc\" is YES, and \"aaaabbbcccc\" is YES.\n\n 29. Example: \"aaaabbbcc\" is NO.\n\n 30. Example: \"aaaabbbc\" (four 'a's, three 'b's, one 'c') -> \n        Condition: 1==4? no, 1==3? no -> NO.\n\n 31. Example: \"aaaabbcc\" (four 'a's, two 'b's, two 'c's) -> \n        Condition: 2==4? no, 2==2? yes -> YES.\n\n 32. Example: \"aaaabbccc\" (four 'a's, two 'b's, three 'c's) -> \n        Condition: 3==4? no, 3==2? no -> NO.\n\n 33. All seems to be working.\n\n Let me code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the condition for the order must be strictly three contiguous blocks. Our traversal ensures that.\n\n But wait: what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\" (all three blocks) but then the condition on counts is satisfied? \n\n        total_a=3, total_b=3, total_c=3 -> YES.\n\n But wait: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' (3) OR the number of 'b' (3). Since 3==3, it satisfies both. So YES.\n\n However, what if the string is \"aaabbbccc\" but the counts are different? \n\n        Example: \"aaabbbccc\" -> YES.\n\n        Example: \"aaabbbcc\" -> NO.\n\n 34. Code:\n\n        s = input().strip()\n        n = len(s)\n\n        # Traverse for 'a's\n        i = 0\n        while i < n and s[i]=='a':\n            i += 1\n\n        # Traverse for 'b's\n        j = i\n        while j < n and s[j]=='b':\n            j += 1\n\n        # Traverse for 'c's\n        k = j\n        while k < n and s[k]=='c':\n            k += 1\n\n        # If we haven't traversed the whole string, then there's an invalid character.\n        if k != n:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        # Check that each block has at least one character.\n        if i == 0 or (j - i == 0) or (k - j == 0):\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit(0)\n\n        total_a = i\n        total_b = j - i\n        total_c = k - j\n\n        if total_c == total_a or total_c == total_b:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n However, note: the problem does not require that the entire string is processed by the three blocks? Actually, the three while loops process the entire string if the string is composed only of 'a','b','c' and in the correct order. But if there's an invalid character, we catch it by k != n.\n\n But wait: what if the string has a mix? For example, \"aabbcc\" is processed correctly, but if we have \"aabbxyz\", then k != n and we output NO.\n\n 35. But the problem says the string only consists of 'a','b','c'. So we don't have to worry about other characters. However, the problem states: \"It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\"\n\n 36. Therefore, we can rely on the input having only 'a','b','c'. But our method still works.\n\n 37. However, note: the problem says the string is built by the process, but we are checking the order. Our method is correct.\n\n 38. Let me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example: \"aaabccc\" -> YES (correct)\n        Example: \"bbacc\" -> NO (correct)\n        Example: \"aabc\" -> YES (correct)\n\n 39. Submit.\n\n But wait, I just thought",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by the specific process described. The process involves three friends: A, B, and C. Friend A starts with a string of 'a's, friend B appends some 'b's to it, and friend C appends some 'c's such that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before appending the 'c's. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the string must be in the correct order (all 'a's followed by all 'b's followed by all 'c's), and the count of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check String Order**: The string must start with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and end with one or more 'c's. Any deviation from this order means the string is invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Calculate the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Additionally, there must be at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\n\ni = 0\nwhile i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n    i += 1\n\nj = i\nwhile j < n and s[j] == 'b':\n    j += 1\n\nk = j\nwhile k < n and s[k] == 'c':\n    k += 1\n\nif k != n:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\nif i == 0 or (j - i) == 0 or (k - j) == 0:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit(0)\n\ntotal_a = i\ntotal_b = j - i\ntotal_c = k - j\n\nif total_c == total_a or total_c == total_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **String Order Check**: The code first checks if the string starts with 'a's, followed by 'b's, and ends with 'c's. This is done by traversing the string in three segments: counting consecutive 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's. If the entire string is not processed in this manner, the answer is \"NO\".\n2. **Minimum Character Check**: The code ensures there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' in the string. If any of these counts is zero, the string is invalid.\n3. **Count Validation**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. If this condition is met, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies both the structural and numerical conditions required for the string to be valid according to the problem's specifications.",
