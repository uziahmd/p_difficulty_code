He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b. One of them might be 'R' (Roman numerals) or both integers.\n Then a string c which is a non-negative integer in base a (might have leading zeros, but length <= 1000).\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the number from base a to decimal (base 10) first, and then convert that decimal number to Roman numerals.\n    However, note: the input c is given in base a. So we must first convert c (which is a string in base a) to a decimal integer.\n\n 2. But if b is not 'R', then we have two integers a and b (both between 2 and 25). We have to convert the number from base a to base b.\n\n 3. Important: The input c can be up to 1000 digits long, so converting to base 10 (if necessary) might require handling big integers? \n    But note: when b is not 'R', the problem says the number won't be greater than 10^15^10 (which is huge, but wait: actually the input c has at most 1000 digits, and base a is at least 2, so the maximum value is (a^1000 - 1). \n    However, the problem states: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — but that seems to be a typo. Actually, the problem says: \"the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — but that is extremely large. \n    But wait, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10.\"\n\n    However, note: the input representation in base a (with at most 1000 digits) might be too big for standard integers. But the problem says that in the non-Roman case the number (meaning the decimal value) is at most 10^15^10? \n    Actually, 10^15^10 is 10^(15*10) = 10^150, which is a very big number. We cannot convert that directly by first converting to base 10 because the base a representation with 1000 digits in base 25 is about 25^1000, which is way beyond what Python can handle as an integer? \n\n    Let me re-read: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — actually, the problem says the input c (in base a) has at most 1000 digits, and the guarantee for non-Roman is that the number (the value) is <= 10^15^10. \n\n    However, note: the problem says \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\" and \"its length doesn't exceed 1000\". The value of c in base a is given by the digits. The guarantee for non-Roman is that the value is at most 10^15^10 (which is 10^150). \n\n    But wait, 10^150 is still a manageable integer in Python because Python integers are arbitrary precision, but converting from base a to base b without going through base 10 might be tricky because the base conversion from base a to base 10 would require calculating a^k * digit for k from 0 to 999, and then converting to base b. \n\n    However, there's an alternative: we can convert from base a to base b without going through base 10, by repeatedly dividing by b and using the digits in base a? But note: the number is represented in base a, and we are to convert to base b. \n\n    Alternatively, we can convert the base a string to a base 10 integer (if the base 10 integer is within the limits of Python, which for numbers up to 10^150 is not directly storable as an int because 10^150 has 151 digits and Python can handle integers with hundreds of digits, but wait: 10^150 is a 1 followed by 150 zeros, which is a string of 151 characters. The base a representation with 1000 digits in base 25: the maximum value is (25^1000 - 1) which is astronomically larger than 10^150. \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", meaning the decimal value is <= 10^15^10. So even though the base a representation is 1000 digits, the actual value is bounded by 10^150. This means we can convert the base a string to a decimal integer (using base conversion) and then convert that decimal integer to base b.\n\n    However, 10^150 is a very big number (about 500 bits) and Python can handle integers that big, but we must do the conversion from base a string to decimal carefully.\n\n    Steps for non-Roman:\n      Step 1: Convert the string c (which is in base a) to a decimal integer.\n        Example: \"16 R\\n5\" -> wait, no, that example is for Roman. Let me take the example: \"2 2\\n1111001\"\n\n      Step 2: Convert the decimal integer to base b.\n\n    But wait: the example \"2 2\\n1111001\": \n        Input: base a=2, base b=2, and the number is \"1111001\" (which is 121 in base 10). Then output is the same: \"1111001\".\n\n    How to convert from base a to decimal?\n        We can use: \n            num = 0\n            for each digit in c (from left to right? actually, the leftmost is the most significant):\n                num = num * a + int(digit)\n\n        But note: the input c may contain letters for bases above 10? The problem says: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n        So the input c in base a (if a>10) uses letters from 'A' onwards. But note: the base a is at most 25, so we'll have digits from '0' to '9' and then 'A' to the digit representing a-1 (which is up to 'Y' for base 25? Actually, base 25: digits are 0-9 and then A=10, B=11, ..., O=14, P=15, Q=16, R=17, S=18, T=19, U=20, V=21, W=22, X=23, Y=24).\n\n        However, note: the input c is given in base a, and the digits are provided in the usual way for base a (using digits 0-9 and then letters for values 10 and above). But the problem says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\", and we are told that the base a is between 2 and 25.\n\n    Steps for base a to decimal conversion:\n        We map each character to a digit value. For digits '0' to '9', the value is the integer value. For letters, if the character is uppercase and between 'A' and the letter corresponding to (a-1), then the value is 10 + (letter - 'A'). But note: the base a is at most 25, so the highest digit is base a-1, which is 24. The letter 'O' is the 15th letter (0-indexed) but we need to map:\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n            value = 0\n            for char in c:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n                value = value * a + d\n\n        But wait, if the base a is 11, then the digit 'A' is allowed (which is 10) and that is valid. However, if base a is 11, then the digits go from 0 to 10, and 'A' is 10. Similarly, base 12: digits 0-11, so we need to map 'A'=10, 'B'=11.\n\n        However, note: the input c might contain digits beyond the base a? The problem says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a\", so we assume the digits are valid.\n\n    Steps for converting decimal to base b (non-Roman):\n        We have the decimal integer n. Then we convert n to base b by repeatedly dividing by b and collecting remainders.\n\n        But note: the problem says to omit leading zeros.\n\n        Example: n=0 -> then output \"0\", but the input c is non-negative. However, the problem says the number in Roman case is not 0, but in non-Roman the number can be 0? Actually, the problem says \"non-negative integer\", and the Roman case is guaranteed not to be 0, but non-Roman can be 0? Let's check the problem statement: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0.\" So if there's no Roman, then c can be 0.\n\n        But note: the input c has at most 1000 digits, and if c is 0, then the string might be \"0\" or \"00...0\". We must output \"0\".\n\n        Steps for conversion from decimal to base b (for non-Roman):\n            if n == 0:\n                return \"0\"\n            digits = []\n            while n:\n                n, r = divmod(n, b)\n                digits.append(r)\n\n            Then we have to map each remainder to a digit. The remainders are from 0 to b-1.\n\n            For remainders 0-9: use the digit as string.\n            For remainders 10 to 24: use the corresponding letter, i.e., chr(ord('A') + r - 10)\n\n            Then reverse the digits list.\n\n        However, note: the base b is between 2 and 25, so we don't have to worry about base greater than 25.\n\n    But wait: what if the input c is very large (like 10^150)? Then converting to decimal (base 10) might be slow and memory intensive? But the problem guarantees that in non-Roman case the decimal value is <= 10^150, so we are storing a number that is at most 151-digit decimal number. The base a representation is 1000 digits, but base a is at most 25, so the decimal value is at most (25^1000) which is way bigger than 10^150, but the problem says the number (decimal value) is at most 10^150. So we are safe because the input is bounded by 10^150.\n\n    However, note: the input c is given as a string in base a. The problem says the number (meaning the decimal value) is <= 10^150. So we can safely convert the entire string to a decimal integer.\n\n    But wait: 10^150 is a 151-digit number. Converting a 1000-digit base-25 number to a decimal integer: the base-25 number with 1000 digits is about 25^1000, which is (25^10)^100 = (2.32e+17)^100, which is way beyond 10^150. But the problem says the number (the decimal value) is at most 10^150. So the input c must represent a decimal number <= 10^150. Therefore, the base a representation must be such that the value is <= 10^150.\n\n    This means that we can do the conversion from base a to base 10 (decimal) because the decimal value is bounded by 10^150, which is a fixed limit. However, the base a representation is 1000 digits, but the base a is at least 2. The maximum value for a base a representation of 1000 digits is (a^1000 - 1). Since a>=2, the smallest base is 2 and the largest base is 25. But note: the problem also says that the input c is non-negative and the decimal value is <= 10^150.\n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\" — wait, I think the problem statement had a typo. The example input \"12 13\\nA\" is small. And the example \"5 R\\n4\" is small. The problem says: \"It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\".\n\n    But 10^15^10 is 10^(15*10)=10^150, so that's the bound. So the decimal value is at most 10^150.\n\n    Now, how to convert from base a to base 10 (decimal) without exceeding memory? The base a representation is a string of up to 1000 digits. The decimal value is at most 10^150, so the decimal representation will have at most 151 digits. But the intermediate representation (the integer) is a big integer, and Python can handle integers with thousands of digits? Actually, 10^150 has 151 digits, so we are storing an integer with up to 151 digits, which is manageable.\n\n    However, the base a representation has 1000 digits, and base a can be up to 25. The maximum value we can get from a base 25 number with 1000 digits is 25^1000, which is about 10^(1000*log10(25)) ~ 10^(1000*1.4) = 10^1400, which is much larger than 10^150. But the problem says the decimal value is at most 10^150. So the input c is not an arbitrary base a string of 1000 digits, but only those whose decimal value is <= 10^150.\n\n    Therefore, we can safely convert the base a string to a decimal integer.\n\n    Steps for Roman case:\n        Step 1: Convert the base a string to a decimal integer (same as above).\n        Step 2: Convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n\n    How to convert decimal to Roman numerals?\n        We know the decimal value is at most 300010 (guaranteed for Roman case). We can use the standard method:\n\n        Define the Roman numeral mapping for the basic symbols and subtractive cases.\n\n        We can break the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\n        Standard mapping:\n          M: 1000, CM: 900, D: 500, CD: 400, C: 100, XC: 90, L: 50, XL: 40, X: 10, IX: 9, V: 5, IV: 4, I: 1.\n\n        Algorithm:\n          def decimal_to_roman(n):\n            roman_map = [\n                ('M', 1000),\n                ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n                ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n                ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n            ]\n            res = ''\n            for numeral, value in roman_map:\n                count = n // value\n                res += numeral * count\n                n -= value * count\n            return res\n\n        But note: the problem says the number is at least 1 (since in Roman case it's not zero and <=300010).\n\n    However, wait: what if the decimal number is 0? In the Roman case, the problem says it won't be 0. So we don't have to handle 0.\n\n    But note: the input c is given in base a. We must first convert that to decimal. Then if b is 'R', we use the Roman conversion.\n\n    Summary of the plan:\n\n    Read the first line and split to get tokens for a and b.\n    Read the next line as the string c.\n\n    Step 1: If b is 'R', then we need to convert the string c (base a) to decimal, then to Roman.\n\n    Step 2: Else (b is an integer), convert the string c (base a) to decimal, then from decimal to base b.\n\n    However, note: what if a is 'R'? The problem says: \"The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R.\" So a is always an integer. The second part (b) may be replaced by an R.\n\n    Therefore, we have:\n\n        tokens = first_line.split()\n        a_str = tokens[0]\n        b_str = tokens[1]\n\n        Then, if b_str is 'R', then base_b = 'R'\n        else: base_b = int(b_str)\n\n    But note: the first token is always an integer? Yes, because the first part is an integer a.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"The first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R\"\n\n    So we read a as an integer, and b as either an integer or the string 'R'.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        import sys\n\n        data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n        if not data: \n            # nothing to do\n            pass\n        else:\n            first_line = data[0].split()\n            a = int(first_line[0])\n            b_str = first_line[1]\n            c_str = data[1].strip()\n\n        Then, if b_str == 'R':\n            # Convert c_str (base a) to decimal\n            n = 0\n            for char in c_str:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n                n = n * a + d\n\n            # Now n is the decimal representation. Then convert n to Roman.\n            # We know 1 <= n <= 300010\n\n            roman_map = [\n                ('M', 1000),\n                ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n                ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n                ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n            ]\n\n            roman_digits = []\n            for numeral, value in roman_map:\n                count = n // value\n                roman_digits.append(numeral * count)\n                n -= value * count\n                if n == 0:\n                    break\n\n            roman_numeral = ''.join(roman_digits)\n            print(roman_numeral)\n\n        Else:\n            b = int(b_str)\n            # Convert c_str (base a) to decimal\n            n = 0\n            for char in c_str:\n                if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n                else:\n                    d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n                n = n * a + d\n\n            # Now convert n to base b (if n==0, then output \"0\")\n            if n == 0:\n                print(\"0\")\n            else:\n                digits = []\n                num = n\n                while num:\n                    num, r = divmod(num, b)\n                    if r < 10:\n                        digits.append(str(r))\n                    else:\n                        digits.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n\n                # Since we were building from least significant digit, we reverse\n                base_b_str = ''.join(digits[::-1])\n                print(base_b_str)\n\n    But wait: what if the base b is 1? The problem says b is at least 2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n    However, note: the input c might be \"0\" (or multiple zeros). Our conversion from base a to decimal: \n        For example, if c_str is \"0\" or \"00\", then n=0.\n\n    We handled n==0 in the non-Roman case.\n\n    But what if the base a is 1? The problem says a is at least 2.\n\n    However, there is a catch: the input c might have leading zeros. Our conversion from base a string to decimal should ignore leading zeros? Actually, no: the representation \"0\" or \"00\" is 0. But our conversion algorithm:\n\n        n = 0\n        for char in c_str:\n            ... update n\n\n        This works for leading zeros: \n            Example: base a=2, c_str=\"00\" -> \n                first char: '0' -> d=0, then n = 0*2+0 = 0.\n                second char: '0' -> d=0, then n = 0*2+0 = 0.\n\n        So that's correct.\n\n    However, there is a problem: the base a conversion might be inefficient for very long strings (up to 1000 digits) but 1000 is acceptable.\n\n    But note: the problem says the decimal value is at most 10^150, so the number of digits in base 10 is at most 151. However, the base a representation is 1000 digits, so the conversion from base a to decimal might require a loop of 1000 iterations, which is acceptable.\n\n    But wait: what if the base a is 2 and the string is 1000 digits? Then the decimal value is 2^999, which is about 10^300, but the problem says that in non-Roman case the decimal value is at most 10^150. So actually, the input c is bounded by 10^150, so even if the base a is 2, the string c cannot be 1000 digits? Because 2^1000 is way bigger than 10^150.\n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15^10\", meaning the decimal value is <= 10^150. Therefore, the input string c (base a) must represent a number <= 10^150.\n\n    This implies that the base a representation is limited in length and digits. For example, if base a=2, then the maximum length of the string c is floor(log2(10^150))+1, which is about 150*log2(10) ~ 150*3.32 = 498 digits. But the problem says the length doesn't exceed 1000. So we must be cautious: the input might have up to 1000 digits, but the decimal value is bounded by 10^150. \n\n    However, the conversion from base a to decimal might be done without converting the entire string at once if we use a smarter algorithm? But 1000 digits is acceptable.\n\n    But wait: 10^150 is a very big integer, and we are doing 1000 multiplications and additions. Each multiplication is with a base a (at most 25) and we are adding a digit (at most 24). The intermediate value n might become very big (like 25^1000) but the problem says the final value is <= 10^150. So we are not storing a number beyond 10^150. However, note that during the conversion, the intermediate values might be as big as (a^k) for k from 0 to len(c_str)-1, and the last one is the entire number (<=10^150). But the intermediate steps might be larger? \n\n    Example: base a=25, and the string is 1000 digits, but the decimal value is <=10^150. Then the intermediate value after processing the first k digits is at most (25^k - 1) * (a^k) ? Actually, no: the conversion is:\n\n        n = 0\n        for each digit d_i (from left to right, the first digit is the most significant):\n            n = n * a + d_i\n\n        So after the first digit, n = d0 (max 24)\n        after the second: n = d0*a + d1 (max 24*25+24 = 624)\n\n        The maximum intermediate value is the entire number (which is <=10^150). But wait, the entire number is the result, and the intermediate steps are the partial results. However, the partial result after k digits is the number formed by the first k digits, which is at most (a^k - 1) (if all digits are the maximum). But the entire number is <=10^150, so the partial results are also <=10^150. \n\n        But note: the entire number is <=10^150, so the intermediate results (partial numbers) are also <=10^150. Therefore, we can store these without exceeding memory.\n\n    However, there is a potential issue: the base a conversion loop runs 1000 times, and in each step we do:\n\n        n = n * a + d\n\n        where n can be as big as 10^150, and a is at most 25, so the next n becomes up to 25*(10^150) + 24, which is about 2.5e151, which is still a number with 152 digits. But the problem says the entire number is <=10^150, so the intermediate n might be temporarily larger than 10^150? \n\n    Actually, the problem does not guarantee that the intermediate values are <=10^150. The guarantee is that the final value (the entire number) is <=10^150. But the intermediate value is the value of the prefix, which is the entire number divided by (a^(remaining_length))? Not exactly. The entire number is the prefix (of k digits) multiplied by (a^(len(c_str)-k)) plus the suffix. But the prefix itself is a k-digit number in base a, and its value is at most (a^k - 1). \n\n    However, the entire number is <=10^150, but the prefix might be larger than 10^150 if k is large enough? \n\n    Example: base a=2, and the entire number is 10^150 (which is a 151-digit decimal). But if we have a string of 500 digits in base 2, the entire number is 2^499 (if the first digit is 1) which is about 10^150 (because 2^10 is about 10^3, so 2^499 is (2^10)^49 * 2^9 ~ (10^3)^49 * 512 ~ 10^147 * 512, which is about 5.12e149, which is less than 10^150). But if we take more digits, then the entire number might exceed 10^150. However, the problem says the entire number is <=10^150, so the input string c is chosen such that the entire number is <=10^150.\n\n    But note: the conversion algorithm does:\n\n        n = 0\n        for each digit d in c_str:\n            n = n * a + d\n\n        This computes the entire number. The intermediate n is the value of the prefix (the part processed so far). The entire number is the last n. The intermediate n's are the values of the prefixes, which are the entire number without the suffix. However, the entire number is <=10^150, but the prefixes (without the suffix) might be as large as the entire number (if the suffix is zeros) or even larger? \n\n    Actually, no: the entire number is the full prefix. The intermediate n after k digits is the value of the first k digits, and the entire number is the value of the first k digits * (a^(n-k)) + the rest. But the entire number is <=10^150, so the intermediate n (the prefix) is at most 10^150 (if the rest is zero). However, if the rest is non-zero, then the entire number is the prefix * (a^(n-k)) plus the rest, so the prefix must be less than or equal to (10^150) / (a^(n-k)) (if we consider the rest positive). But we don't know the rest.\n\n    However, the problem does not require us to worry about the intermediate values being too big because the entire number is <=10^150, and we are using Python integers which can handle up to 10^150 (which is 151-digit numbers). The intermediate n is the entire number without the trailing part, so it is at most 10^150 (if the trailing part is zero) or even if the trailing part is non-zero, then the entire number is the sum of the prefix and the trailing part (but in base a). Actually, the entire number is built by the formula, and the intermediate n is the value of the prefix. The entire number is the prefix * (a^(len(c_str)-k)) + the suffix, so the prefix is the entire number divided by (a^(len(c_str)-k)) (integer division). But the entire number is <=10^150, so the prefix is at most 10^150 (if the exponent is 0) or less. \n\n    Actually, the entire number is the full string, so the intermediate n (after k digits) is the value of the first k digits, and the entire number is the value of the first k digits * (a^(len(c_str)-k)) + the value of the remaining (len(c_str)-k) digits. Therefore, the intermediate n (prefix) is the entire number without the suffix, so it is at most the entire number (if the suffix is zero). But the entire number is <=10^150, so the intermediate n is <=10^150.\n\n    Therefore, we are safe.\n\n    But wait: what if the base a is 2 and the entire number is 10^150, and we are processing the first half of the digits? Then the intermediate n might be around (10^150)^(1/2) which is 10^75, which is still a 76-digit number. That is manageable.\n\n    However, the problem says the entire number is <=10^150, so the intermediate n is the entire number without the trailing part, but the entire number is built by the formula, so the intermediate n is the entire number divided by (a^(len(c_str)-k)) (integer division). The entire number is <=10^150, and the divisor is at least 2^(len(c_str)-k). The length of c_str is at most 1000, so the divisor can be as small as 2^0=1 (if k=len(c_str)) and as large as 2^1000 (if k=0). \n\n    But note: the entire number is <=10^150, so the intermediate n (which is the entire number without the suffix) must be at most (10^150) / (a^(len(c_str)-k)) (if we consider the suffix as the minimal value) or even the entire number without the suffix is the entire number, then the intermediate n is the entire number. But wait, the entire number is built by the formula, and the intermediate n is the entire number without the suffix? Actually, no: the entire number is the full string, and the intermediate n is the value of the prefix (the first k digits). The entire number is the prefix * (a^(len(c_str)-k)) + the value of the remaining (len(c_str)-k) digits. \n\n    Since the entire number is <=10^150, then the prefix * (a^(len(c_str)-k)) + (the value of the remaining) <=10^150. Therefore, the prefix is at most (10^150 - (the value of the remaining)) / (a^(len(c_str)-k)). But the value of the remaining is at most (a^(len(c_str)-k) - 1). So the prefix is at most (10^150) / (a^(len(c_str)-k)) (approximately). \n\n    This means that the intermediate n (the prefix) is bounded by 10^150 / (a^(len(c_str)-k)), which is much smaller than 10^150 if k is small. \n\n    But note: the entire number is <=10^150, so the intermediate n (prefix) is at most 10^150 (if k is the last digit) and then as k decreases, the intermediate n increases, but the divisor (a^(len(c_str)-k)) becomes larger, so the prefix (intermediate n) must be smaller. \n\n    Therefore, the intermediate n is bounded by 10^150, so we are safe.\n\n    However, let me test with an example: base a=10, and the entire number is 10^150. Then the string c is \"1\" followed by 150 zeros. Then the conversion:\n\n        n = 0\n        for the first digit '1': n = 0*10+1 = 1\n        then 149 zeros: each step: n = n*10 + 0 -> n remains 1 until the last digit.\n\n        Then the entire number is 10^150, which is the last n.\n\n    But wait, the entire number is built by the entire string, so the intermediate n is 1 until the last digit. Then the last digit: n = 1 * 10^150 + 0 = 10^150.\n\n    The problem is that the intermediate n (before the last digit) is 1, which is safe, and then we do 1 * 10 + 0 -> but wait, the entire string is 151 digits: \n        The first digit: n=1\n        The second digit: n = 1*10+0 = 10\n        ...\n        The 151st digit: n = 10^150\n\n    But note: the base a is 10, so we are building the number from left to right. The entire number is 10^150, which is a 151-digit decimal number. The intermediate n after the first digit is 1, then after the second is 10, then 100, ... then 10^150.\n\n    The issue is that 10^150 is stored as an integer, which is 151 digits. But 10^150 is the final result. The problem says the entire number is <=10^",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, possibly including Roman numerals. The solution involves reading input values, converting the number from its given base to a decimal (base 10) if necessary, and then converting it to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to get the base `a` and the target base `b` (which could be 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number `c` represented in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion**:\n   - **Non-Roman Target Base**: Convert the number from base `a` to decimal, then from decimal to the target base `b`. Handle digits beyond 9 by using letters (A for 10, B for 11, etc.).\n   - **Roman Numerals Target**: Convert the number from base `a` to decimal first. Then, convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to Roman symbols.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the input number is zero (output \"0\") or when the target base is Roman (ensuring the number is within the valid range).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    \n    parts = data[0].split()\n    a = int(parts[0])\n    b_str = parts[1]\n    c_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        n = 0\n        for char in c_str:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            n = n * a + d\n            \n        roman_map = [\n            ('M', 1000),\n            ('CM', 900), ('D', 500), ('CD', 400),\n            ('C', 100), ('XC', 90), ('L', 50), ('XL', 40),\n            ('X', 10), ('IX', 9), ('V', 5), ('IV', 4), ('I', 1)\n        ]\n        res = []\n        for numeral, value in roman_map:\n            count = n // value\n            res.append(numeral * count)\n            n -= value * count\n            if n == 0:\n                break\n        roman_numeral = ''.join(res)\n        print(roman_numeral)\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\n        n = 0\n        for char in c_str:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                d = ord(char) - ord('0')\n            else:\n                d = ord(char) - ord('A') + 10\n            n = n * a + d\n            \n        if n == 0:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            num_val = n\n            while num_val:\n                num_val, r = divmod(num_val, b)\n                if r < 10:\n                    digits.append(str(r))\n                else:\n                    digits.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n            base_b_str = ''.join(digits[::-1])\n            print(base_b_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The program reads two lines from standard input. The first line contains the source base `a` and the target base `b` (either an integer or 'R'). The second line is the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R', the number `c` is first converted from base `a` to a decimal integer. This decimal number is then converted to Roman numerals by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols to the result.\n3. **Base Conversion (Non-Roman)**: For a non-Roman target base, the number `c` is converted from base `a` to a decimal integer. This decimal number is then converted to the target base `b` by repeatedly dividing the number by `b` and collecting remainders, which are then mapped to digits (using letters for values greater than 9).\n4. **Edge Handling**: If the converted number is zero, the output is \"0\". The conversion processes digits from least significant to most significant, hence the result is reversed before printing.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
