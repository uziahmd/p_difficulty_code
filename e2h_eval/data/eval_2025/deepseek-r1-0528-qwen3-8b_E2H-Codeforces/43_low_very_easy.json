He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n We are given a string S of length between 1 and 5000, consisting of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n Conditions:\n 1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (because A appended some 'b' and B is guaranteed to have at least one 'a' and one 'b').\n 2. The string must be split into three parts: \n    - First part: only 'a's (from the original A's part)\n    - Second part: only 'b's (from B's appending)\n    - Third part: only 'c's (from C's appending)\n\n However, note that the problem does not require that the entire string is divided by contiguous segments? Actually, from the problem statement:\n\n   - A gives a string of some number of 'a's.\n   - Then B appends some number of 'b's (so the string becomes [a...a][b...b]).\n   - Then C appends some number of 'c's (so the string becomes [a...a][b...b][c...c]).\n\n But note: the example input \"aabc\" is accepted. Let's break down \"aabc\":\n   Original A: \"aa\", then B appends one 'b', so we get \"aab\", then C appends one 'c' (which equals the number of 'b') -> \"aabc\".\n\n However, note the example \"bbacc\" is rejected because of the order. So the conditions for the order are:\n\n   - All the 'a's must come first, then all the 'b's, then all the 'c's.\n\n Why is \"bbacc\" invalid?\n   The string \"bbacc\": \n     It starts with two 'b's, but there should be no 'b' before the first 'a'. \n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Check if the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'. If not, return \"NO\".\n\n 2. Check the order: the string must be non-decreasing in the sense that once a letter that is not 'a' appears, we cannot have an 'a' again. Similarly, once a 'b' appears, we cannot have an 'a' again, and once a 'c' appears, we cannot have 'a' or 'b' again.\n\n    Therefore, we can traverse the string and check that:\n      - The string must start with zero or more 'a's, then zero or more 'b's, then zero or more 'c's.\n\n    However, note that the problem states that A gives a string of 'a's (so at least one 'a') and B appends at least one 'b'. So the string must have at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'. Also, C appends at least one 'c'? Not necessarily: the problem says \"some number\", which could be zero. But wait: the condition for C is that the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' or the number of 'b'. \n\n    However, note: the problem says \"B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string\". The word \"some\" usually implies at least one. But the problem also says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" \n\n    Let's read carefully: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a' OR the number of 'b'. \n\n    But note: the string after B's step has counts of 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends a number of 'c' that is either the count of 'a' (which is the original count of 'a') or the count of 'b' (which is the count of 'b' from B's appending). \n\n    However, after C appends, the total count of 'a' remains the same, but the count of 'b' remains the same, and the count of 'c' is set to either the initial count of 'a' (from A) or the initial count of 'b' (from B). \n\n    But note: the string after B's step has:\n        count_a = (original from A)\n        count_b = (appended by B)\n\n    Then C appends n_c = count_a or n_c = count_b.\n\n    However, the problem does not specify whether the counts are taken before or after C appends. But the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string\".\n\n    The key is: when does C look at the string? The problem says: \"B now gives this string to C\".",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed by following a specific sequence of operations. The operations involve appending 'b's and 'c's to a string of 'a's under certain conditions. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Presence of 'a' and 'b':** The string must contain at least one 'a' and one 'b'. If either is missing, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n2. **Validate Character Order:** The string should consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's and then 'c's. Any deviation from this order (like 'a's after 'b's or 'c's before 'b's) makes the string invalid.\n3. **Check Count Condition for 'c's:** The number of 'c's appended must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the entire string. This count check is performed only if the order condition is satisfied.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # If the string doesn't contain at least one 'a' and one 'b', return NO.\n    if 'a' not in s or 'b' not in s:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Check the order: must be non-decreasing in terms of characters, i.e., 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n    n = len(s)\n    i = 0\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n        \n    j = i\n    while j < n and s[j] == 'b':\n        j += 1\n        \n    k = j\n    while k < n and s[k] == 'c':\n        k += 1\n        \n    if k != n:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n        \n    # Now, check the counts of 'c' must be either equal to count of 'a' or count of 'b'\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks:** The code first checks if the string contains both 'a' and 'b'. If not, it prints \"NO\" and exits.\n2. **Order Validation:** The code verifies that all 'a's come before 'b's and all 'b's come before 'c's. This is done by traversing the string and ensuring no out-of-order characters are present.\n3. **Count Validation:** After confirming the correct order, the code checks if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string. If so, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural and numerical conditions required for the string to be valid according to the problem's specifications.",
