    "thought": "\n We are guaranteed the string length is at most 100, so we can use a straightforward approach.\n Steps:\n 1. Read the input string.\n 2. We are to find the longest substring that appears at least twice (possibly overlapping).\n 3. We can consider all possible substrings and check for duplicates, but since the string length is small (<=100),\n    we can do the following:\n\n Approach:\n - We can iterate over all possible substring lengths (from 1 up to half the string length, but actually we can go from 1 to n//2)\n   because if we are looking for two occurrences, then the maximum length of such substring is floor(n/2) or even more?\n   Actually, note: the problem says \"at least twice\", and they can overlap. But the entire string cannot be repeated twice (unless it's two same halves, but even then, if the string is \"aaa\", then the substring \"a\" (length 1) appears three times, but also \"aa\" (length 2) appears twice? Actually, in \"aaa\", the substring \"aa\" appears twice (overlapping) as [0:2] and [1:3]. \n\n However, note: the problem does not require non-overlapping. So we can have two overlapping occurrences.\n\n Alternate approach:\n - We can consider every substring and record the frequency of each substring (by starting index and by the substring itself?).\n   But note: we are only interested in the length of the substring that appears at least twice.\n\n Since the string length is at most 100, we can generate all substrings and store them in a dictionary with their starting index (or just count, but we don't need the exact indices) but wait: two occurrences must be distinct? Actually, the problem says \"can be met in the string at least twice\", and they can overlap. So we don't care about the distinctness of the occurrences beyond the fact that they appear at least twice.\n\n However, note: two different starting positions that form the same substring.\n\n Steps for a simple solution:\n 1. Let s be the input string, n = len(s)\n 2. We'll create a dictionary to map substring -> list of starting indices (or just the count, but then we might get false positives for the same occurrence? Actually, no, because we are considering contiguous substring. But if we just count the number of occurrences, we can do that.\n\n But note: the problem doesn't require counting beyond two, and we are to find the maximum length for which there is at least two occurrences.\n\n We can do:\n   For length L from 1 to n//2 (but actually, the maximum length of a substring that can appear at least twice is floor(n/2) because if we have two non-overlapping occurrences of length L, then 2*L <= n. However, note: overlapping is allowed. Then the condition for two occurrences (even overlapping) is that the substring must appear at least twice. The maximum L can be as long as the string has two occurrences (which might be overlapping). Actually, the maximum L can be such that the total number of starting positions for a substring of length L is at least 2, but the starting positions must be distinct (because if we use the same starting position twice, that would be the same occurrence). So we are counting distinct starting indices.\n\n Example: \"aaa\" -> \n   substring \"a\" (L=1): appears at indices 0,1,2 -> count=3 -> valid.\n   substring \"aa\" (L=2): appears at indices 0,1 -> count=2 -> valid.\n\n But what is the maximum L? In \"aaa\", the maximum L is 2.\n\n However, note: if we have \"abcabc\", then the substring \"abc\" (L=3) appears at index0 and index3 -> valid. Then we can have L=3.\n\n So we can iterate L from 1 to n (but note: if we take L too large, then the substring might not appear twice. Actually, the maximum L for which a substring can appear twice is n-1? But if the string is \"abcde\", then no substring of length 3 appears twice? Actually, the maximum L is the maximum integer such that there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice.\n\n How about iterating from L_max = n down to 1, and check for any substring of length L that appears at least twice? Then the first L we find (the largest) is our answer.\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate L from 1 to n//2 (if we consider non-overlapping, but overlapping is allowed) so we can have up to n-L+1 starting positions. But actually, we don't know the maximum L, so we can iterate from L=1 to L=n//2 (since two occurrences of length L must start at different positions,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, and the string consists of lowercase Latin letters with a maximum length of 100. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters that repeats at least once within the string. Since the string length is small (up to 100 characters), a straightforward approach is feasible without worrying about excessive computational complexity.\n2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking all possible substrings of the string and determining their frequencies. For each substring length, we check if any substring of that length appears at least twice. The largest such length is our answer.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate over all possible substring lengths from 1 to half the string length (since a substring longer than half the string cannot repeat). For each length, we generate all unique substrings of that length and count their occurrences. If any substring occurs at least twice, we note its length as a candidate for the solution.\n4. **Optimization**: By processing substrings from the longest to the shortest, we can immediately return the first encountered length that meets the criteria, ensuring efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Check for substring lengths from 1 to n//2 (inclusive)\n    for L in range(n // 2, 0, -1):\n        seen = {}\n        found = False\n        for start in range(0, n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[start:start+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                found = True\n                break\n            else:\n                seen[substr] = True\n        if found:\n            max_length = L\n            break\n            \n    print(max_length)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n2. **Initial Setup**: The length of the string is determined, and `max_length` is initialized to 0.\n3. **Iterating Substring Lengths**: The loop runs from the maximum possible substring length (half the string length) down to 1. This ensures we check the longest substrings first.\n4. **Tracking Substrings**: For each substring length `L`, we use a dictionary to track all unique substrings encountered. If a substring is found more than once, we set `max_length` to `L` and break out of the loop.\n5. **Output**: The largest valid substring length found is printed. If no such substring exists, the output will be 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for repeating substrings by leveraging early termination upon finding the longest valid substring, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.",
