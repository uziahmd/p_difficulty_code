Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and a string A of 2n digits.\n\n The game: two players take turns (each exactly n moves) by removing the leftmost digit and appending it to their own number.\n\n We want to output a string of length 2n consisting of 'H' and 'M' (for Homer and Marge) that indicates the sequence of moves.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the first player gets S1 dollars and the second gets S2 dollars. The total prize is S1 + S2.\n\n But note: the two numbers S1 and S2 are built from the digits in order. The catch is: the players choose the order of moves? Actually, the problem states that \"before each turn players determine who will make the next move\", meaning they can choose the assignment of moves arbitrarily (as long as each makes exactly n moves). However, the digits are removed from the left one by one.\n\n Important: the entire process must use all the digits. The moves are fixed: in each move, the leftmost digit is taken. But the players can decide the pattern of taking (who goes first, second, third, etc.)?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize.\"\n\n So, we can assign the moves arbitrarily (meaning we can choose which player takes which digit). However, the digits are removed from the left, so the order of digits is fixed. The only choice is which player gets which digit (with the constraint that each gets exactly n digits).\n\n How do we assign? We have to assign the 2n digits into two sequences (S1 and S2) of n digits each. The assignment must be such that the digits are taken in the order they appear (the i-th digit of S1 must be the j-th digit of A for some j, but the relative order in each sequence must be the same as in A? Actually, no: because we remove from the left, and we are going to assign each digit to either Homer or Marge, but the removal order is fixed: the first digit must be assigned to someone, then the second, etc.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to: split the sequence A (which has 2n digits) into two subsequences (each of length n) that preserve the original order, and we wish to maximize the sum of the two numbers (where each subsequence is interpreted as a base-10 number).\n\n But note: the entire sequence is removed from left to right. So the two subsequences are interleaved. However, the digits are taken in the given order and we decide at each step which player takes it.\n\n Let's denote:\n   Let H_digits = list of digits assigned to Homer (in order of removal, so the first digit Homer takes is the first time he moves, but note: the removal order is fixed, so the digits are taken in increasing index order, but the assignment is arbitrary as long as we pick n digits for Homer and n for Marge.\n\n However, the two numbers S1 and S2 are formed by the digits in the order they were removed. But since the removal is from the left, the first digit taken is the very first, and if Homer takes the first digit, then the first digit of S1 is that digit. Then if Marge takes the second, then the first digit of S2 is the second digit of A.\n\n But note: the subsequent digits are removed from the remaining string. The key point: the assignment must be such that the two sets of digits (for Homer and Marge) are two disjoint sets of indices of size n, and the indices must be increasing (since we remove from left to right). And the two subsequences are the digits at the chosen indices for each player, in increasing index order.\n\n However, wait: the problem does not require that the two subsequences are contiguous? Actually, the moves are sequential: at move i, the leftmost digit is taken and appended to the player's number. Then the next move takes the next leftmost, etc. So the assignment is just: we assign each digit (by its position) to either H or M, and then the number for H is the digits assigned to H in the order of the positions (from smallest to largest index). Similarly for M.\n\n So, we are to assign each of the 2n digits (at positions 0 to 2n-1) to either H or M, with exactly n for each, and then form two numbers:\n\n   S1 = the digits assigned to H, read in increasing order of index (i.e., the digit at the smallest index assigned to H is the most significant, then the next, etc.)\n   S2 = similarly for M.\n\n And we wish to maximize S1 + S2.\n\n However, note: the two numbers are independent. We can think of it as: the entire set of digits is fixed, and we are splitting them arbitrarily (without changing the order) between two players. The value of a player's number is determined by the digits and the order (which is the original order). \n\n But note: the problem also requires to output the sequence of moves (a string of length 2n, with 'H' and 'M') that corresponds to the assignment. The first character is the first move (which takes the first digit), the second character is the second move (second digit), etc.\n\n So, we have to decide for each position i (from 0 to 2n-1) whether the digit at that position goes to Homer or Marge.\n\n However, we cannot independently assign because the two numbers are built from the assigned digits in the order of the positions.\n\n How to solve?\n\n Since n is at most 18, the total length is 36. We cannot iterate over all subsets (which would be C(36,18) ~ 9e9, too many).\n\n Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming.\n\n Let dp[i][j] be the maximum difference (or the maximum total value) we can achieve after processing the first i+j digits, having assigned j digits to Homer (and hence i digits to Marge). But wait, we have two numbers, and the total value is the sum of two numbers. However, the digits we assign now will be placed at specific positions (which are fixed by the index). \n\n Alternatively, consider: the entire assignment is a sequence of 2n digits, and we are going to assign each to H or M. The value of the number for Homer is the digits assigned to H, but the significance of a digit depends on when it was assigned. Specifically, the first digit assigned to H (which is the earliest index) is the most significant, then the next, etc.\n\n We can think of building the two numbers from left to right. At each step, we have two choices: assign the current digit to H or to M. Then, the contribution of the digit d at the current step is:\n\n   If assigned to H, then it will be placed at the k-th position (0-indexed from the left) in Homer's number, where k is the number of digits already assigned to H (because the earlier ones are more significant). Similarly for M.\n\n But note: the entire assignment is fixed by the order. However, the catch is that the two numbers are built simultaneously: the assignment at step i (the i-th digit, counting from 0) will be the (count_H)-th digit of Homer's number (if assigned to H) and similarly for M.\n\n However, the problem is that the total value is the sum of the two numbers, and we want to maximize that.\n\n We can use DP that keeps track of:\n   - the number of digits assigned to H so far (let h)\n   - the number of digits assigned to M so far (m = i+j - h, but actually we are at step i, and we have processed i+1 digits)\n\n But then the value contributed by a digit depends on the position (the power of 10). For example, the first digit (index0) if assigned to H will be multiplied by 10^(n-1) (if it's the first digit of Homer's number and Homer has n digits) but wait: we don't know the future. \n\n Alternatively, we can build the numbers from left to right and use state (h, m) meaning we have assigned h digits to H and m digits to M (so we are at step h+m). Then, the next digit (if assigned to H) will be the (h)-th digit of H's number (so its place value is 10^(n-h-1)). Similarly for M.\n\n However, the total value of the two numbers is the sum of the two, and we are making decisions for each digit.\n\n Let dp[h][m] = the maximum total value (S1+S2) we can get from the remaining part (from digit index h+m to the end) given that we have already assigned h digits to H and m digits to M.\n\n But note: the entire assignment is fixed from the beginning to the end. We have to account for the fact that the digits we assign now will be placed at specific positions (depending on how many digits we assign to each in the future).\n\n Alternatively, we can precompute the entire number for each player if we knew the complete assignment. But we don't.\n\n Another idea: we can consider the entire assignment and compute the value of S1 and S2.\n\n The value of S1 is: \n   Let the digits assigned to H be d0, d1, ..., d_{n-1} (in the order of removal, so d0 is the first digit assigned to H, then d1, etc.). Then S1 = d0 * 10^(n-1) + d1 * 10^(n-2) + ... + d_{n-1} * 10^0.\n\n Similarly for S2.\n\n Then the total prize is S1 + S2.\n\n Now, if we let x_i be the digit at the i-th position (0-indexed) and we assign it to H or M, then the contribution of x_i is:\n\n   If assigned to H, then it will be placed at a position that depends on how many digits of H have been assigned so far (including this one). Specifically, if at step i we assign to H, then the current count of H is h (starting from 0), and this digit will be the h-th digit in H's number (so its weight is 10^(n - h - 1)).\n\n   Similarly, if assigned to M, then the weight is 10^(n - m - 1) (but note: we are at step i, and the total digits assigned so far is h+m, but for M we are tracking separately: if we assign to M, then the current count of M is m, and the weight is 10^(n - m - 1)).\n\n However, the complication is that the assignment of future digits may change the weights? Actually, no: the weight of a digit in a player's number is determined by the total number of digits that player will eventually have (which is n) and the position at which the digit is inserted (which is the count of digits already assigned to that player). \n\n But note: the entire assignment is fixed: we know that each player gets exactly n digits. Therefore, the digit we assign now to H, regardless of what happens later, will be placed at a position that depends on the total number of digits we assign to H in the entire string (which is n). However, we don't know the exact position until we know the entire assignment.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider that the entire string of 2n digits is fixed. We are going to assign each digit to one of the two players. Then, the value of Homer's number is:\n\n   Let H_digits be the list of digits assigned to H (in the order of increasing index). Then S1 = H_digits[0] * 10^(n-1) + H_digits[1] * 10^(n-2) + ... + H_digits[n-1] * 10^0.\n\n Similarly for M.\n\n Now, we can also think: the entire set of digits is fixed, and we are going to assign each digit to one of the two numbers, and the number's value is determined by the digit's value and its rank (position) in the number (which is determined by the order of appearance in the original string).\n\n However, note: the two numbers are built by taking the digits in the original order, but the two numbers are independent. We wish to maximize S1 + S2.\n\n We can use DP with state (i, h) where i is the current index (from 0 to 2n) and h is the number of digits assigned to H so far (then the number assigned to M is i - h). Then the remaining digits are from index i to 2n-1.\n\n The total value from the remaining part depends on the assignment of the remaining digits. But the value we can add from the current digit (at index i) is:\n\n   If we assign to H: then this digit will be the h-th digit of Homer's number (so its weight is 10^(n - h - 1)), and then the remaining part for H will have n - h - 1 digits, so the base for the rest of H's digits will be 10^(n - h - 1) for the next one? Actually, no: the entire number is fixed by the assignment.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the total value as:\n\n   Let F(i, h) = maximum total value (S1+S2) from the substring starting at index i, given that we have already assigned h digits to H (and hence i - h digits to M) and we must assign exactly n - h to H and n - (i - h) to M from the remaining (2n - i) digits.\n\n But note: the remaining digits must be assigned so that H gets n - h and M gets n - (i - h) = n - i + h.\n\n However, the value contributed by a digit at position i is:\n\n   If we assign it to H, then the value added is: digit_value * (10^(n - h - 1)) + [the value of the rest of the digits for H and the entire M part]?\n   But wait, the rest of the digits for H (which are n - h - 1) will be assigned from the remaining digits, and they will be less significant than the current one. Similarly for M.\n\n But note: the entire assignment is independent for the two players, but the catch is that the same digit cannot be assigned twice. And the two players' numbers are built from the digits in the order of the original string.\n\n However, there is a simpler way: the entire set of digits is fixed, and the two numbers are built from disjoint sets of digits (each set of size n) and the digits in each number are arranged in increasing index order (so the original order). The value of S1 is the number formed by the digits assigned to H in the order of occurrence. Similarly for S2.\n\n Then the total value is independent of the interleaving? Actually, no: because the digits are fixed and the assignment is just a partition. However, the two numbers are built from the same set of digits, but the catch is that the two numbers are built from the entire set of digits, and the assignment is fixed by the order: the digit at index i is available at step i, and if we assign it to H, then it becomes the next digit in H's number (so its position is determined by the count of H's digits so far).\n\n But note: the two numbers are built from the same set of digits, but the order of the digits in each number is fixed by the original order (so we cannot rearrange). Therefore, the problem is equivalent to: partition the 2n digits (which are fixed) into two subsequences (each of length n) and the value of each subsequence is the number formed by the digits in the order of the original sequence.\n\n Then, the total prize is the sum of these two numbers.\n\n Now, we wish to maximize the sum.\n\n This is a classic partitioning problem. We can use DP with state (i, h) where i is the index we are at (from 0 to 2n) and h is the number of digits we have assigned to H so far. Then:\n\n   dp[i][h] = maximum total value (S1+S2) from the digits from i to the end, given that we have already assigned h digits to H (and hence i - h digits to M) from the first i digits.\n\n Then, we consider the two options for the current digit A[i]:\n\n   Option 1: assign A[i] to H.\n        Then, the current digit contributes: int(A[i]) * (10^(n - h - 1))   [because it will be the (h)-th digit of H, and there will be n - h - 1 digits left to assign to H, so the base is 10^(n - h - 1)]\n        And then we need to assign the remaining n - h - 1 digits to H and n - (i - h) digits to M from the next (2n - i - 1) digits.\n\n        But note: the rest of the digits (from i+1 to the end) must be assigned so that H gets n - h - 1 and M gets n - (i - h) = n - i + h.\n\n        However, the value from the rest of the digits is independent of the current assignment? Actually, no: because the rest of the digits will be assigned and they will have their own place values.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break the total value into two parts: the part that comes from the current digit and the part from the rest.\n\n        But note: the rest of the digits for H (if any) will be assigned from the remaining digits and they will be less significant. Similarly for M.\n\n        However, the entire assignment is independent. We can precompute the value for the rest of the digits if we know how many digits we assign to H and M.\n\n        Let F(i, h, m) be the maximum total value from the substring starting at index i, given that we have to assign h more digits to H and m more digits to M (so h+m = (2n - i) and h<=n, m<=n).\n\n        Then, the recurrence is:\n\n          F(i, h, m) = \n            if h==0 and m==0: 0\n            else:\n                option1: if h>0, then assign A[i] to H: \n                    value1 = int(A[i]) * (10**(m_total - h - 1))   ? Wait, no: the exponent for H's digit depends on the total number of H's digits (which is n) and the current count (h). Actually, the current digit is the next one for H, so its place value is 10^(n - h - 1). But note: we are not at the beginning, we are at the current state (h, m) and we are about to assign. The rest of the digits for H will be (n - h) in total? Actually, we are tracking the remaining counts: we need to assign h more to H and m more to M. Then, the current digit if assigned to H becomes the (n - h - 1)-th digit from the least significant? Actually, no: we are building from left to right, so the first digit we assign to H (among the remaining) is the most significant for the remaining part.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Let total_remaining = 2n - i\n          Then, the current digit is the first of the remaining, so if we assign it to H, then the remaining part must assign h-1 to H and m to M, and the current digit will be the (total_remaining - (h-1+m) - 1)th digit? \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the entire value without breaking the DP by the exponent, because the exponents are fixed by the position in the entire number.\n\n        But note: the entire number for H has n digits. The current digit, if assigned to H, will be placed at a position that depends on how many H digits we have already assigned (in the entire game). However, in our DP state we don't know the entire assignment from the beginning, only the remaining.\n\n        Actually, we can compute the exponent for the current digit if we know the total number of digits that will be assigned to H (including this one) is h_total (which is fixed: n). Then the current digit's position in the final H's number is (current_count) from the left, so its exponent is 10^(n - current_count - 1). But we don't know the current_count until we know the entire assignment.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          We know that the entire assignment is fixed, and the two numbers are built from the digits in the original order. Then, the entire value can be computed by:\n\n            S1 = 0\n            S2 = 0\n            multiplier = 1\n            for i in range(2n-1, -1, -1):\n                if assignment[i] == 'H':\n                    S1 += int(A[i]) * multiplier\n                else:\n                    S2 += int(A[i]) * multiplier\n                multiplier *= 10\n\n          But wait, the digits are assigned in the order of the original string. However, the above builds the numbers from right to left (least significant first). Actually, no: the last digit assigned is the least significant. But the first digit assigned is the most significant.\n\n          Actually, we should build from left to right:\n\n            S1 = 0\n            S2 = 0\n            for i in range(2n):\n                if assignment[i] == 'H':\n                    S1 = S1 * 10 + int(A[i])\n                else:\n                    S2 = S2 * 10 + int(A[i])\n\n        But note: the assignment is for the entire string. We don't know the assignment until the end.\n\n        How can we do DP without knowing the entire assignment? \n\n        We can use DP that considers the entire assignment and the current state (i, h) and the value from the rest. But the value from the rest depends on the assignment of the remaining digits and the exponents.\n\n        However, the exponents for a digit depend on the total number of digits that will be assigned to the same player after it. \n\n        Example: \n          Consider two digits: \"12\", n=1. Then two moves. Suppose we assign the first digit to H and the second to M. Then:\n            H: 1, M: 2 -> total 1+2 = 3.\n          But if we assign the first to M and the second to H: then M:1, H:2 -> total 1+2=3.\n\n          Now, consider three-digit example? Actually, the problem states 2n digits, and each player gets n digits.\n\n        Another idea: since n is at most 18, we can iterate over all possible assignments? There are C(36,18) which is about 9e9, which is too many.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use DP that goes over the 36 digits and at each step we decide to assign to H or M, and we keep track of the counts and the current value.\n\n        But the current value: if we assign a digit to H, then we add int(digit)* (10^(n - h - 1)) and then for the rest of the digits for H, they will be shifted by one (so we multiply the current H value by 10 for each future H digit). Similarly for M.\n\n        However, we don't know the future. We can use DP that stores the entire value of H and M so far? But the numbers are up to 18 digits, so the maximum value is 10^18, which is too big for DP state.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use DP that stores the state as (i, h) and the current value of H and M? Then the state space is too large.\n\n        We need to find the maximum total value, but note: the total value is the sum of two numbers. We can separate the contributions.\n\n        Let's define:\n\n          dp[i][h] = maximum total value (S1+S2) from the first i digits (0-indexed, so i from 0 to 2n) and h digits assigned to H so far.\n\n        Then, for the i-th digit (0-indexed), we have two choices:\n\n          If we assign to H:\n            Then, the current digit is the h-th digit of H (so its value is int(A[i]) * (10^(n - h - 1))? \n\n            However, wait: the entire H number has n digits, and we are going to assign n - h - 1 more digits to H. Then the current digit's value is int(A[i]) * (10^(n - h - 1)), and then the remaining part (from i+1 to the end) must be assigned so that H gets n - h - 1 more digits and M gets n - (i+1 - h) digits.\n\n            But note: the remaining part's value depends on the assignment and the exponents. However, the exponents for the remaining digits are fixed by the entire assignment. \n\n            Actually, the entire value of H is built by:\n\n              H_value_so_far = (previous H_value_so_far) * 10 + int(A[i])\n              then we continue with the rest.\n\n            Similarly, we can update the state by storing the entire H_value_so_far and M_value_so_far? But the numbers are too big.\n\n        Another idea: we can use DP that doesn't store the entire number but the difference in the exponents? Or use meet-in-the-middle? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use iterative deepening and backtracking, but 36 is too high.\n\n        Let me reframe: we are going to assign each digit to H or M. The total value is:\n\n          S1 = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} (digit at the k-th H assignment) * 10^(n-1-k)\n          S2 = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} (digit at the k-th M assignment) * 10^(n-1-k)\n\n        And note: the k-th H assignment is the (i_k)-th digit (with i_0 < i_1 < ... < i_{n-1}) and similarly for M.\n\n        Then, the total value is:\n\n          total = Σ_{all digits} [if assigned to H: digit * (10^(n-1 - (position_in_H))] \n\n        But the position_in_H for a digit assigned to H is the index of that digit among the H-assigned digits (0-indexed from the left). Similarly for M.\n\n        How to compute the position_in_H for a digit? It is the count of H digits that have been assigned before it (in the original order). Similarly for M.\n\n        Then, we can use DP with state (i, h, m) but then the exponent for the next digit depends on h and m. However, the state space is (2n+1) * (n+1) * (n+1) which is 37*19*19 ~ 13000 states, which is acceptable.\n\n        But then, what is the value we add for assigning a digit to H or M?\n\n        The digit at position i, if assigned to H, will be the (h)-th digit of H (because we have already assigned h digits to H from the previous i-1 digits, and we are at the i-th digit). Then, the exponent for this digit is 10^(n - h - 1). Similarly, if assigned to M, the exponent is 10^(n - m - 1).\n\n        However, note: we are going to assign the remaining digits. The entire assignment is fixed, so the total value for H is:\n\n          H_value = 0\n          for each digit assigned to H (in increasing index order) at position i, we add: digit * (10^(n - (rank_in_H) - 1))\n\n        But the rank_in_H is the count of H digits from the start until this digit (including this one). \n\n        In our DP, we are processing the digits in order. So at state (i, h, m), we have processed i digits (from 0 to i-1) and have assigned h to H and m to M. Then, the next digit (at index i) if assigned to H will be the (h)-th digit (0-indexed) of H, so its exponent is 10^(n - h - 1). \n\n        Similarly, if we assign to M, its exponent is 10^(n - m - 1).\n\n        Then, the recurrence is:\n\n          dp[i][h][m] = maximum total value from the first i digits and having h for H and m for M.\n\n          Then, for the i-th digit (which is the (i)-th digit, 0-indexed, so we are at state (i, h, m)), we consider:\n\n            Option1: assign to H -> then new state (i+1, h+1, m) and we add: int(A[i]) * (10**(n - h - 1))\n            Option2: assign to M -> then new state (i+1, h, m+1) and we add: int(A[i]) * (10**(n - m - 1))\n\n        But wait: the exponent for a digit assigned to H depends on the current count of H (h) at the time of assignment. However, note: the total number of H digits is fixed to n, and the current count is h (meaning we have assigned h digits to H so far, and we are going to assign n-h-1 more). But the exponent for the current digit is 10^(n - h - 1) because it will be the (h)-th digit (so there will be n-h-1 digits after it) and hence the place is 10^(n-h-1).\n\n        However, we must ensure that we do not exceed n for H and M. Conditions: h < n and m < n.\n\n        Base case: \n          dp[0][0][0] = 0\n\n        Then, we iterate i from 0 to 2n-1, and for each state (h, m) at step i, we update the next state.\n\n        The total state space is (2n+1) * (n+1) * (n+1) which is 37 * 19 * 19 = 13000 states, and for each state we do 2 transitions. So about 26000 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n        Then, we want to find the maximum dp[2n][n][n] (we've processed all digits, and we have assigned n to H and n to M).\n\n        But wait: we are building the entire value. However, note: the exponents are fixed by the position in the number. But the catch: the same digit might appear in different contexts (if we assign differently) and the exponent depends on the total number of digits assigned to the same player that are going to be after it? \n\n        Actually, no: the exponent for a digit assigned to H is 10^(n - h - 1) because there will be exactly n - h - 1 digits assigned to H after this one (in the entire game) but wait, no: the entire game will have exactly n digits for H, and we are at a state where we have assigned h digits to H so far, so the current digit is the (h)-th, and there will be n - h - 1 digits left to assign to H. Then, the current digit is at position (n - 1 - (n - h - 1)) = h? Actually, no: the most significant digit is the first one, so the first digit has exponent 10^(n-1), the second 10^(n-2), ..., the last (n-th) is 10^0.\n\n        And the current digit (if assigned to H) is the h-th digit (0-indexed) in the entire H number, so its exponent is 10^(n-1-h).\n\n        Similarly, for M: 10^(n-1-m).\n\n        Therefore, we should use exponent = n-1-h for H and n-1-m for M.\n\n        Then, the recurrence:\n\n          dp[i][h][m] = max(\n             dp[i+1][h+1][m] + (int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h)))   if h < n,\n             dp[i+1][h][m+1] + (int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-m)))   if m < n\n          )\n\n        But wait, we are processing the digits from left to right, and the exponent for a digit depends on the current count (how many digits have been assigned to that player so far). However, this is correct because the current digit is the next one for the player, so its place value is the highest available for that player (since we haven't assigned the remaining digits). \n\n        However, note: the remaining digits for H are n-h-1, so the current digit is the h-th (0-indexed) and will be multiplied by 10^(n-1-h). \n\n        But consider: if we assign a digit to H at state (i, h, m) and then later assign more digits to H, those digits will be multiplied by lower exponents (because they are more to the right). This matches the usual number formation.\n\n        However, there is a problem: the entire value of H is the sum of (digit * 10^(exponent)) for all digits assigned to H, and the exponents are determined by the entire assignment. But in our DP, we are computing the value as if the current digit is placed at the current exponent and the future digits will be assigned to lower exponents. \n\n        But note: the assignment of future digits does not affect the exponent of the current digit. The current digit's exponent is fixed by the count of H digits so far (h) and the total n. \n\n        Therefore, the recurrence is correct.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          A = input().strip()   # string of 2n digits\n\n          dp = 3D array: dimensions [2n+1][n+1][n+1] (initialize to -infinity or a very small number)\n          dp[0][0][0] = 0\n\n          for i in range(2*n):\n            for h in range(0, n+1):\n              for m in range(0, n+1):\n                if dp[i][h][m] is not set, skip.\n                Then, consider two options.\n\n          Then, we want to find the maximum value in dp[2*n][n][n] and then backtrack to find the assignment.\n\n        However, note: we are asked to output the sequence of moves (a string of length 2n, with 'H' and 'M').\n\n        We can store the decision at each state. Alternatively, we can do a backward DP and store the path.\n\n        But note: the state (i, h, m) and we go forward. We can store parent pointers.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          After computing dp[i][h][m] for all i, h, m, we backtrack from state (2n, n, n) to (0,0,0).\n\n        However, we need to remember which decision was taken.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          dp[i][h][m] = best value, and we also store:\n\n            from_H[i][h][m] = True/False if the best way to reach (i,h,m) came from an H assignment.\n            from_M[i][h][m] = similarly.\n\n        Then, we backtrack:\n\n          i = 2n, h = n, m = n\n          res = []   # to record the moves from last to first\n\n          while i > 0:\n            if from_H[i][h][m]:\n                res.append('H')\n                i -= 1\n                h -= 1\n            elif from_M[i][h][m]:\n                res.append('M')\n                i -= 1\n                m -= 1\n\n          Then reverse res.\n\n        But note: we are processing from i=0 to i=2n. In the DP, we update from i to i+1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store the DP table and then backtrack from the final state backwards.\n\n        However, we have to design the DP to store the source.\n\n        Let's do:\n\n          dp[i][h][m] = maximum total value from the first i digits with h assigned to H and m to M.\n\n          We'll also have two 3D arrays: from_H and from_M, which are booleans (or we can store the previous state).\n\n        Steps for DP:\n\n          Initialize dp[0][0][0] = 0, and from_H[0][0][0] = False, from_M[0][0][0] = False.\n\n          For i from 0 to 2n-1:\n            for h from 0 to n:\n              for m from 0 to n:\n                if dp[i][h][m] is set (or we can initialize all to -inf and check):\n\n                  Option1: assign the i-th digit to H, if h < n.\n                    new_value = dp[i][h][m] + int(A[i]) * (10**(n-1-h))\n                    Compare with dp[i+1][h+1][m]: if new_value > dp[i+1][h+1][m], then update dp[i+1][h+1][m] = new_value and set from_H[i+1][h+1][m] = True, and remember the previous",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total prize for two players, Homer and Marge, who take turns removing digits from the left end of a given number A. Each player must make exactly n moves, and the goal is to assign each digit to one of the players such that the sum of their respective numbers (formed by the digits they've collected) is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves partitioning the 2n-digit number A into two subsequences (each of length n) such that the sum of the numbers formed by these subsequences is maximized. The key insight is that the value of each digit in a player's number depends on its position (most significant digit contributes more). \n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where the state `dp[i][h][m]` represents the maximum total value achievable after processing the first `i` digits, having assigned `h` digits to Homer and `m` digits to Marge. The transitions involve deciding whether to assign the current digit to Homer or Marge, updating the state accordingly.\n\n3. **State Transitions**: For each digit at position `i`, if assigned to Homer, its contribution to the total value is `digit * 10^(n-1-h)`, where `h` is the current count of digits assigned to Homer. Similarly, if assigned to Marge, the contribution is `digit * 10^(n-1-m)`.\n\n4. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the state `(2n, n, n)` to determine the sequence of assignments (Homer or Marge) for each digit, ensuring the maximum total prize.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    n = int(data[0].strip())\n    A_str = data[1].strip()\n    \n    total_digits = 2 * n\n    dp = [[[None for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)] for ___ in range(total_digits+1)]\n    from_H = [[[False for _ in range(n+1)] for __ in range(n+1)] for ___ in range(total_digits+1)]\n    dp[0][0][0] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(total_digits):\n        for h in range(n+1):\n            for m in range(n+1):\n                if dp[i][h][m] is None:\n                    continue\n                current_digit = int(A_str[i])\n                if h < n:\n                    new_value = dp[i][h][m] + current_digit * (10 ** (n-1-h))\n                    if dp[i+1][h+1][m] is None or new_value > dp[i+1][h+1][m]:\n                        dp[i+1][h+1][m] = new_value\n                        from_H[i+1][h+1][m] = True\n                if m < n:\n                    new_value = dp[i][h][m] + current_digit * (10 ** (n-1-m))\n                    if dp[i+1][h][m+1] is None or new_value > dp[i+1][h][m+1]:\n                        dp[i+1][h][m+1] = new_value\n                        from_H[i+1][h][m+1] = False\n    \n    seq = []\n    i_val, h_val, m_val = total_digits, n, n\n    while i_val > 0:\n        if from_H[i_val][h_val][m_val]:\n            seq.append('H')\n            i_val -= 1\n            h_val -= 1\n        else:\n            seq.append('M')\n            i_val -= 1\n            m_val -= 1\n    seq.reverse()\n    print(''.join(seq))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The code reads the input values for `n` and the 2n-digit number `A_str`. It initializes a 3D DP array to store the maximum values for each state `(i, h, m)` and a 3D boolean array `from_H` to track whether a state was reached by assigning the previous digit to Homer.\n\n2. **DP Table Filling**: The nested loops iterate over each digit position `i`, and for each possible count of digits assigned to Homer (`h`) and Marge (`m`). For each valid state, it checks if assigning the current digit to either player yields a higher total value, updating the DP table and tracking the assignment choice.\n\n3. **Backtracking**: After processing all digits, the solution backtracks from the final state `(2n, n, n)` to construct the sequence of moves. The sequence is built by checking the `from_H` array to determine if each move was made by Homer or Marge, then reversed to present the correct order.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal assignment sequence using dynamic programming, leveraging state transitions and backtracking to ensure the maximum total prize for both players.",
