He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given two tokens in the first line: a and b.\n The second line is a string representing a number in base a.\n\n Steps:\n 1. If b is 'R', then we need to convert the number from base a to an integer (base 10) and then convert that integer to a Roman numeral (without leading zeros, and note the input guarantee for Roman case).\n 2. Otherwise, we convert the given string (which is in base a) to an integer (base 10), then convert that integer to base b (which is given as an integer between 2 and 25). However, note that the base b might be greater than 10, so we have to use letters for digits above 9 (like A for 10, B for 11, etc.).\n\n But note: the input number c is given in base a, which can be up to 25. The string may have leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 1000.\n\n Important: The input for Roman numerals is guaranteed to be at most 300010 and not zero.\n\n However, note the example: \n   Input: \"16 R\\n5\" -> Output: \"V\"\n   Input: \"5 R\\n4\" -> Output: \"IV\"\n\n But wait: \n   In the first example, base a=16, the number is \"5\" (which is 5 in base 16). Then we convert 5 to base b=Roman: which is V.\n\n Also note: \n   Input: \"2 2\\n1111001\" -> Output: \"1111001\"\n   Here, base a=2, base b=2, and the number is \"1111001\". We just output the same number without leading zeros.\n\n Steps for conversion:\n\n Case 1: b is an integer (not 'R')\n   Step 1: Convert the string `c` from base a to a base-10 integer.\n        Since the string may contain digits and possibly letters for bases above 10 (but note: the input base a is between 2 and 25, and the string c is given in base a, so the digits used are from '0' to (a-1). For bases above 10, we use letters? Actually, the problem says: \"in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\".\n\n        However, note: the input string c is given in base a. How are digits represented?\n        Example: base 12, then digits go from 0 to 11. For 10 and 11, we use 'A' and 'B'. But what if base a is greater than 10? Then the input string c might contain letters (from '0' to '9' and then 'A' to ...). But the problem states: \"a non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros\".\n\n        So, we have to handle the conversion of the string c from base a to base 10.\n\n        How to do that?\n          Let n = len(c)\n          value = 0\n          for each character d in c:\n            if d is a digit (0-9): then digit_value = int(d)\n            else: digit_value = ord(d) - ord('A') + 10\n\n          But wait: what if the base a is 11? Then the digits can be from 0 to 10. And the digit for 10 is 'A'. Similarly, base 12: 0-9 and A,B.\n\n        However, note: the input base a is at least 2 and at most 25. So we can map any character that is not a digit to a number by: \n          if d in '0'..'9': value = int(d)\n          else: value = 10 + (ord(d) - ord('A'))\n\n        But also note: the input string might have uppercase letters? The problem does not specify, but the examples use uppercase.\n\n        Then, we convert the entire string to base 10 by: \n          base10 = 0\n          for i from 0 to len(c)-1:\n            base10 = base10 * a + digit_value\n\n        However, note: the input string might be very long (up to 1000 digits). This number might be huge (since a can be up to 25 and the string up to 1000 digits) but the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510\", meaning it's too big to represent as an integer in base 10? \n\n       ",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given number from one base to another, with the possibility of the target base being the Roman numeral system. The solution involves handling two main cases: standard base conversion and Roman numeral conversion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to get the source base `a` and the target base `b`. The target base can be an integer or 'R' for Roman numerals.\n2. **Standard Base Conversion**: If the target base is an integer:\n   - Convert the input string from base `a` to a base-10 integer.\n   - Convert the base-10 integer to the target base `b`, using letters (A, B, etc.) for digits greater than 9.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If the target base is 'R':\n   - Convert the input string from base `a` to a base-10 integer.\n   - Convert the base-10 integer to a Roman numeral, adhering to the subtractive principle (e.g., 4 is \"IV\", 9 is \"IX\").\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    a_str = data[0]\n    b_str = data[1]\n    \n    c_str = input().strip()\n    \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        num_base10 = 0\n        power = 1\n        for char in reversed(c_str):\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                digit = int(char)\n            else:\n                digit = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n            if digit >= a_str.isdigit() and a_str.isdigit():\n                base_a = int(a_str)\n                if digit >= base_a:\n                    raise ValueError(\"Invalid digit for base\")\n            else:\n                base_a = int(a_str)\n                if digit >= base_a:\n                    raise ValueError(\"Invalid digit for base\")\n            num_base10 += digit * power\n            power *= base_a\n        \n        def roman_numerals(n):\n            val = [\n                (1000, 'M'),\n                (900, 'CM'),\n                (500, 'D'),\n                (400, 'CD'),\n                (50, 'L'),\n                (40, 'XL'),\n                (10, 'X'),\n                (9, 'IX'),\n                (5, 'V'),\n                (4, 'IV'),\n                (1, 'I')\n            ]\n            res = ''\n            for value, symbol in val:\n                while n >= value:\n                    res += symbol\n                    n -= value\n            return res\n        \n        print(roman_numerals(num_base10))\n    else:\n        base_a = int(a_str)\n        base_b = int(b_str)\n        \n        num_base10 = 0\n        for char in c_str:\n            if '0' <= char <= '9':\n                digit = int(char)\n            else:\n                digit = 10 + (ord(char) - ord('A'))\n            if digit >= base_a:\n                raise ValueError(\"Invalid digit for base\")\n            num_base10 = num_base10 * base_a + digit\n        \n        if num_base10 == 0:\n            print('0')\n            return\n            \n        digits = []\n        n = num_base10\n        while n:\n            r = n % base_b\n            n = n // base_b\n            if r < 10:\n                digits.append(str(r))\n            else:\n                digits.append(chr(ord('A') + r - 10))\n                \n        result = ''.join(digits[::-1])\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The first line of input is split into `a_str` (source base) and `b_str` (target base). The second line is the number string `c_str` in base `a`.\n2. **Base Conversion**:\n   - **Standard Base Conversion**: The input string is converted to a base-10 integer by processing each digit, considering both numeric and alphabetic digits (for bases >10). The base-10 number is then converted to the target base by repeatedly dividing by the target base and collecting remainders, which are mapped to digits (0-9, A-Z).\n   - **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The base-10 number is converted to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs. The conversion involves repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values from the number and appending the corresponding symbols to the result.\n3. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles leading zeros by omitting them in the output. For example, if the input number is zero, it directly outputs \"0\". The Roman numeral conversion ensures numbers up to 300010 are correctly formatted according to Roman numeral rules.",
