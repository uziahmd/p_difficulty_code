    "thought": "\n We are given one line with three integers: w, h, k.\n The plate is w x h. We are to add k rings. The first ring goes along the edge of the plate (width 1 cell) and each subsequent ring is 2 cells away from the edge.\n\n Observation:\n For the i-th ring (starting at i=1), the inner rectangle has dimensions:\n   width = w - 4*(i-1)\n   height = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n However, note that the ring is the border of this inner rectangle (which has a width of 1 cell). But wait, the problem says:\n   \"the i-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) x (h - 4(i-1))\"\n\n The border (ring) of a rectangle of size a x b has how many cells?\n   If the rectangle is a x b (with a>=3 and b>=3, because we have borders), then the border consists of:\n     top row: a cells\n     bottom row: a cells\n     left and right columns, but without the corners (already counted) so (b-2) for left and (b-2) for right, for the middle rows.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: \n   total cells in the border = 2*a + 2*b - 4   [because the four corners are counted twice if we do 2a+2b]\n\n But wait, actually: \n   The border of an a x b grid (with a,b >= 2) is 2*(a+b) - 4? Actually, let's check for a=3, b=3: \n      Without using the formula: 8 cells (which is the entire 3x3 grid). \n      Using the formula: 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4 = 8 -> correct.\n\n However, note: when the inner rectangle becomes too small, we might not be able to form a full ring? But the problem states that k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n Steps:\n 1. We know k rings. For the i-th ring (i from 0 to k-1, but we'll index from 1 as per problem), we consider:\n      a_i = w - 4*i   [but note: the problem says the first ring uses the original plate, so i=1: w - 4*(1-1)=w, then second ring: w-4*1, etc.]\n\n 2. But note: the problem says the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge. This means the first ring (i=1) is the outermost, then second ring (i=2) is two steps inward.\n\n Actually, the problem says: the i-th ring (with i starting at 1) is defined on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\n 3. However, we must ensure that the inner rectangle is at least 3x3 to have a border? Actually, the condition for k is: \n        k <= floor( (min(w, h) + 1) / 4 )\n    So, the inner rectangle for the k-th ring would be:\n        w' = w - 4*(k-1)\n        h' = h - 4*(k-1)\n    and we require that w' >= 3 and h' >= 3? Actually, the condition ensures that the k-th ring is defined (because the minimal dimension after subtracting 4*(k-1) must be at least 3?).\n\n    Let me check: \n        k_max = floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n        Then for k = k_max, we have:\n            min_dimension_after = min(w, h) - 4*(k_max-1) \n        But note: k_max is chosen such that the next ring (if we tried k_max+1) would break the condition. \n\n    Actually, the problem says: k is at most floor((min(n, m)+1)/4). \n\n    Example: w=3, h=3 -> min=3, then floor((3+1)/4)=floor(4/4)=1 -> k=1.\n        Then the ring is defined on 3x3: which gives 8 cells.\n\n    Example: w=7, h=9 -> min=7, then floor((7+1)/4)=floor(8/4)=2 -> k can be up to 2.\n\n    For k=1: \n        ring1: 7x9 -> border: 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4 = 32-4=28 -> matches example.\n\n    For k=2:\n        ring2: inner rectangle is (7-4*(2-1)) x (9-4*(2-1)) = 3x5 -> border: 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4 = 16-4=12.\n        Then total gilded cells = 28 (from ring1) + 12 (from ring2) = 40 -> matches example.\n\n 4. Therefore, the approach is:\n\n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(k):   # i from 0 to k-1, representing the i-th ring (0-indexed)\n        a = w - 4*i\n        b = h - 4*i\n\n        But note: the i-th ring (0-indexed) corresponds to the ring that is (i+1)-th in the problem's description.\n\n        However, we must check: the problem says the first ring (i=1) uses the original plate, so for i=0 we use the original plate? Actually, no.\n\n        Let me reindex: \n          In the problem, the first ring is defined on the rectangle of size w x h (with i=1, so subtract 4*(1-1)=0).\n          The second ring (i=2) is defined on (w-4*(2-1)) x (h-4*(2-1)).\n\n        So in our loop, for the i-th ring (0-indexed) we are actually at ring number i+1. Therefore, we subtract 4*i.\n\n        However, note: the condition for k: we are only going to compute k rings.\n\n        But wait: what if the inner rectangle becomes too small? The problem condition on k ensures that we don't have to worry about negative dimensions or zero. \n\n        However, we must also note: the border formula requires that both a and b are at least 2? Actually, for the border to exist, the rectangle must be at least 3x3? \n\n        Let me check: \n          For a rectangle of size 1x1: border doesn't exist (and the formula 2*(1+1)-4 = 0, which is correct).\n          For a rectangle of size 2x2: border is the entire 2x2? But wait, the problem says \"bordering cells\", but the definition of the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. \n\n        However, the problem states that the first ring is along the edge of the plate (so the original plate is at least 3x3). And k is bounded by floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n        Example: w=3, h=3, k=1: \n            a = 3, b = 3 -> 2*(3+3)-4 = 8.\n\n        Example: w=4, h=4, then min(w,h)=4 -> k_max = floor((4+1)/4)=floor(5/4)=1.\n            Then for k=1: \n                a=4, b=4 -> 2*(4+4)-4 = 12.\n\n        Example: w=5, h=5, then k_max=floor((5+1)/4)=floor(6/4)=1 (since 6//4=1). But wait, we could have two rings? Let's see:\n\n            First ring (k=1): inner rectangle 5x5 -> border = 2*(5+5)-4 = 16.\n            Second ring (k=2): inner rectangle 5-4*1=1x5-4*1=1 -> which is invalid (negative? no, but 1x1). The problem condition says k<=floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) -> for w=5, min=5, (5+1)/4=1.5 -> floor=1, so k=2 is not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, we don't have to worry about negative dimensions because k is bounded.\n\n        But note: when we subtract 4*i, we might get a dimension less than 3, but the condition on k ensures that the last ring (k-th) has at least 3x3.\n\n        Actually, the condition: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4) implies that for the k-th ring (i=k-1):\n            w' = w - 4*(k-1) >= 3? Not exactly: \n            Let m = min(w, h)\n            Then k <= floor((m+1)/4) => k <= (m+1)//4   (using integer floor division)\n\n            Then for the k-th ring, the inner rectangle has dimension m' = m - 4*(k-1) >= ?\n\n            We know that k <= (m+1)//4, so 4*k <= m+1  => 4*k-4 <= m-3   [because subtract 4*k-4 from both sides?]\n\n            Actually, let me write:\n                k <= (m+1)//4  => 4*k <= m+1   (since floor division, but actually (m+1)//4 is the floor, so 4*k <= m+1)\n\n            Then for the k-th ring: \n                m' = m - 4*(k-1) >= m - 4*((m+1)//4 - 1)   [but k can be any value up to (m+1)//4]\n\n            However, we don't need to worry because the condition on k is such that the k-th ring is valid (at least 3x3). \n\n        But note: the problem says the i-th ring is defined for the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1))x(h-4*(i-1)), and the condition on k is given by the input. \n\n        Therefore, we can compute the border for each ring as long as the dimensions are positive. However, the problem condition on k ensures that we don't go beyond the plate.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n\n            # The border of a rectangle of a x b is: 2*(a+b) - 4, but only if a>=2 and b>=2? Actually, the formula holds even if a or b is 1? \n            # However, if a==1 or b==1, then the rectangle is a single row or column, and the border is just the entire rectangle (which is a*b) but wait:\n\n            # Let's test: \n            #   a=1, b=5: then the border should be the entire 1x5? But the border of a 1x5 is 5 (the whole thing). \n            #   Using the formula: 2*(1+5)-4 = 10-4=6 -> which is wrong.\n\n            # So the formula 2*(a+b)-4 is only valid for rectangles that have at least 2 rows and 2 columns? \n\n            # Actually, the problem states that the rings are drawn on the inner rectangle. The drawing of a ring requires that the inner rectangle has at least one border (so the inner rectangle must be at least 3x3 for the first ring? but wait the first ring is the edge of the plate, and the plate is at least 3x3). \n\n            # However, note: the problem says \"each ring has a width of 1 cell\". This implies that the ring is drawn on the border of the inner rectangle. The inner rectangle must have at least one layer of cells. \n\n            # How is the border defined for an a x b grid?\n            #   The border is the set of cells that are either in the first row, last row, first column, or last column.\n\n            # For a grid of a x b, the border has:\n            #   top row: b cells\n            #   bottom row: b cells\n            #   left column: a-2 cells (excluding the two corners already counted)\n            #   right column: a-2 cells\n            #   Total = 2*b + 2*(a-2) = 2*a + 2*b - 4.\n\n            # But this formula breaks when a<2 or b<2.\n\n            # Conditions for the formula to hold (without negative counts): \n            #   a>=2 and b>=2.\n\n            # However, in our problem, the plate has at least 3x3, and we are subtracting 4*i. The condition on k ensures that for the k-th ring, we have a>=3 and b>=3? \n\n            # Actually, the condition is: k <= floor((min(w,h)+1)/4). \n\n            # Let's check for the k-th ring (i = k-1):\n            #   a = w - 4*(k-1)\n            #   b = h - 4*(k-1)\n            #   We need a>=3 and b>=3? Actually, the problem doesn't explicitly say, but the condition on k is chosen so that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 3x3?\n\n            #   Because: \n            #       k <= (min(w,h)+1)//4   (in integer floor division)\n            #       => 4*k <= min(w,h)+1\n            #       => 4*(k-1) <= min(w,h) - 3   [by rearranging: 4*k <= min(w,h)+1 => 4*k-4 <= min(w,h)-3]\n            #       => w - 4*(k-1) >= w - (min(w,h)-3) \n            #       But note: w might be the larger one. Actually, we know that the inner rectangle must have at least 3 in the smallest dimension.\n\n            #   Actually, the condition is: \n            #       min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= 3   => 4*(k-1) <= min(w, h)-3   => k-1 <= (min(w, h)-3)/4\n            #       Then k <= (min(w, h)-3)/4 + 1 = (min(w, h)+1)/4, which is the same condition.\n\n            #   Therefore, the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has minimum dimension at least 3.\n\n            # But note: the condition in the problem for k is floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n            # However, the formula for the border requires that the rectangle has at least 3 in both dimensions? Actually, no: the border formula works for any a>=2 and b>=2. \n\n            # But wait: if one dimension is 2, then the border is still defined. For example, 2x5: \n            #   The border: \n            #       top row: 5\n            #       bottom row: 5\n            #       left column: 2-2 = 0 (because we already counted the two corners in the top and bottom rows)\n            #       right column: 0\n            #       Total = 10, but using formula: 2*(2+5)-4 = 10-4=6 -> wait, that doesn't match.\n\n            # Let me count manually for 2x5:\n            #   We have two rows and five columns. The border is the entire grid (because there is no inner part). But wait, the problem says the ring is the border of the inner rectangle. \n            #   The inner rectangle of 2x5: \n            #       The border is the set of cells that are on the edge. Since there are only two rows, the entire grid is the border? \n            #       Actually, the problem says the ring has a width of 1 cell. But the entire grid is just one cell thick? \n\n            #   However, the problem says the first ring is along the edge. In a 2x5, the entire grid is the edge. \n\n            #   So the border of a 2x5 is the entire 2*5=10 cells.\n\n            #   The formula 2*(a+b)-4 for 2x5: 2*(2+5)-4 = 14-4=10 -> correct.\n\n            #   Now, for a 1x5: \n            #       Using the formula: 2*(1+5)-4 = 10-4=6, but the entire grid is 5 cells. \n            #       Why? The formula doesn't work for a=1 because we cannot remove the corners from the sides (there are no corners). \n\n            #   Actually, the formula 2*(a+b)-4 is derived for a>=2 and b>=2. \n\n            #   We must ensure that a>=2 and b>=2 for the formula to hold.\n\n            # But note: the condition on k ensures that for the k-th ring, the inner rectangle has minimum dimension at least 3 (both a and b are at least 3). \n\n            # However, what if the original plate is 3x3 and k=1: then a=3, b=3 -> formula works.\n\n            # What if the original plate is 4x4 and k=1: then a=4, b=4 -> formula: 2*(4+4)-4=12, which is correct (the entire 4x4 minus the inner 2x2? Actually, the border of 4x4 is 4*4 - 2*2 = 16-4=12).\n\n            # Therefore, we can use the formula as long as a>=2 and b>=2. \n\n            # But note: the problem condition on k ensures that we never get a dimension below 3 for the k-th ring. However, in intermediate rings (if k>=2) we might have a dimension between 2 and 3? \n\n            # Example: w=7, h=9, k=2: \n            #   First ring: 7x9 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 28.\n            #   Second ring: 3x5 -> 2*(3+5)-4 = 12.\n\n            #   Both 3 and 5 are >=2, so the formula holds.\n\n            # Another example: w=5, h=5, k=1: \n            #   5x5 -> 2*(5+5)-4=16.\n\n            #   Now, if we try k=2 for w=5, h=5: \n            #       Condition: floor((5+1)/4)=1, so k=2 is not allowed. \n\n            # Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        However, to be absolutely safe, we can use the following:\n\n        If a < 2 or b < 2, then the border is simply a*b (because the entire rectangle is the border). But wait, the problem condition on k ensures that we don't get such small dimensions until we have finished the rings? \n\n        Actually, the problem condition on k is designed so that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring has at least 3 in the smallest dimension. But for intermediate rings, we might have a dimension of 2? \n\n        Example: w=6, h=6, then k_max = floor((6+1)/4)=floor(7/4)=1 -> so k=1 only. \n\n        But wait, let me recalc: \n            k_max = floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) -> for w=6, h=6: min=6, then (6+1)//4 = 1 (since 7//4=1). \n            Then for k=1: \n                a=6, b=6 -> border=2*(6+6)-4=20.\n\n            However, we could have two rings? \n                First ring: 6x6 -> 20 cells.\n                Second ring: 6-4=2x6-4=2 -> 2x2: which is 4 cells (using the entire 2x2 as border). \n            But the condition says k<=1, so we don't consider k=2.\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to handle the case where a or b is 1 because the problem condition on k prevents us from having a ring that would lead to a dimension less than 3 in the k-th ring. However, note that the condition is for the k-th ring, but intermediate rings (for i from 0 to k-1) might have a dimension of 2? \n\n        Let me check: \n            k_max = floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) is the maximum k allowed.\n\n            We are iterating for i from 0 to k-1 (inclusive). \n\n            The smallest dimension of the inner rectangle for the i-th ring (0-indexed) is: \n                d_i = min(w, h) - 4*i\n\n            We require d_i >= 3 for the last ring (i=k-1). But for an intermediate ring, we might have d_i >= 3, but actually we require that for all rings the inner rectangle is at least 3x3? \n\n            Actually, the problem does not specify that the ring must be drawn only if the inner rectangle is at least 3x3. It defines the ring for the inner rectangle of size (w-4*i)x(h-4*i). \n\n            However, the problem says the first ring goes along the edge (which requires the plate to be at least 3x3). \n\n            And the condition on k is given by the input, so we assume that the input k satisfies that the inner rectangle for the k-th ring is at least 3x3.\n\n            But what if k=1 and the plate is 3x3? Then the inner rectangle is 3x3, which is okay.\n\n            However, what if k=1 and the plate is 2x2? Then the condition on k: \n                k_max = floor((min(2,2)+1)/4) = floor(3/4)=0. But the input constraint says k>=1, so we don't have to consider.\n\n            Therefore, we can safely use the formula 2*(a+b)-4 for each ring as long as a>=2 and b>=2. \n\n            But note: the problem states that the plate has at least 3 rows and 3 columns, so the initial dimensions are at least 3x3. \n\n            However, the problem says: \"3 <= w, h <= 100\", so the initial plate is at least 3x3.\n\n            Also, the condition on k: k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n            We must check for the intermediate rings: \n                The smallest dimension for the i-th ring is: d_i = min(w, h) - 4*i.\n\n            Since we are only iterating for i from 0 to k-1, and k is at most (min(w,h)+1)//4, then the smallest dimension for the i-th ring is at least:\n                d_i >= min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= min(w, h) - 4*((min(w, h)+1)//4 - 1) \n\n            But note: we don't know the exact relation. However, the problem condition ensures that the k-th ring (the last one) has minimum dimension at least 3. \n\n            But what about the first ring? \n                i=0: d_0 = min(w, h) >= 3 (given w,h>=3) -> so a>=3 and b>=3, which is >=2.\n\n            The second ring (if exists): \n                i=1: d_1 = min(w, h) - 4. \n                Condition: k>=2 -> then min(w, h) must be at least 4*1 + 3 = 7? Actually, no: \n                    k>=2: then k<=floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) -> so min(w,h) must be at least 4*(k-1)+1? \n\n            Actually, the condition for k=2: \n                k<=floor((min(w,h)+1)/4) -> 2 <= (min(w,h)+1)//4 -> min(w,h)+1 >= 8 -> min(w,h)>=7.\n\n            Then for the second ring: d_1 = min(w, h)-4 >= 7-4=3, so still >=3.\n\n            Similarly, for k=3: \n                min(w,h) >= 4*2+1 = 9? Actually: 3 <= (min(w,h)+1)//4 -> min(w,h)+1>=12 -> min(w,h)>=11.\n\n            So the condition on k ensures that for the i-th ring (0-indexed), the inner rectangle has minimum dimension at least 3? \n\n            Actually, for the i-th ring (0-indexed, so the ring number is i+1), we have:\n                d_i = min(w, h) - 4*i >= min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= 3   (from the condition that the k-th ring is defined)\n\n            But wait, the condition is for the k-th ring (i=k-1) to be valid, but for i<k-1, we might have more than 3? \n\n            However, note: the condition is on the entire k, meaning that the k rings are to be drawn. The condition ensures that the k-th ring is valid (minimum dimension 3). \n\n            But the problem does not require that the rings are drawn only if the inner rectangle is at least 3x3? It defines the ring for the inner rectangle of size (w-4*i)x(h-4*i). \n\n            However, the problem states: \"the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — 2 cells away from the edge and so on.\" \n\n            This implies that we stop when the inner rectangle becomes too small to draw a ring? But the input k is given and bounded by floor((min(w, h)+1)/4). \n\n            Therefore, we are guaranteed that for each ring (from 0 to k-1) the inner rectangle has dimensions at least 3x3? \n\n            Actually, the condition for the i-th ring (0-indexed) is that the inner rectangle has dimensions (w-4*i) x (h-4*i). The minimal dimension is min(w, h)-4*i. \n\n            We know that for the last ring (i=k-1): min(w, h)-4*(k-1) >= 3.\n\n            But what if k=1: then min(w, h)-0>=3 -> true because w,h>=3.\n\n            For k=2: then min(w, h)-4>=3 -> min(w, h)>=7, which is given by the condition.\n\n            For k=3: then min(w, h)-8>=3 -> min(w, h)>=11.\n\n            So the condition on k (which is provided in the input) ensures that for every ring i (from 0 to k-1) the inner rectangle has minimum dimension at least 3.\n\n            Therefore, for every ring, we have a>=3 and b>=3, so we can use the formula 2*(a+b)-4.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the border as:\n\n            border = 0\n            if a == 1 or b == 1:\n                # Actually, we know a>=3 and b>=3, so we skip this.\n                pass\n            else:\n                border = 2*(a+b) - 4\n\n        But since we know a>=3 and b>=3, we can simply use:\n\n            total += 2*(a+b) - 4\n\n        However, note: the formula 2*(a+b)-4 works for a>=2 and b>=2. And we have a>=3 and b>=3, so it's safe.\n\n 5. Code:\n\n        Read w, h, k from stdin.\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            # Since the problem condition ensures that a>=3 and b>=3 (actually the minimal dimension is at least 3) for all rings from 0 to k-1, we can use:\n            total += 2*(a+b) - 4\n\n        Print(total)\n\n 6. Let's test with examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 3 1\"\n            w=3, h=3, k=1\n            i=0: a=3, b=3 -> 2*(3+3)-4 = 12-4=8 -> output 8.\n\n        Example 2: \"7 9 1\"\n            w=7, h=9, k=1\n            i=0: a=7, b=9 -> 2*(7+9)-4 = 2*16-4=32-4=28.\n\n        Example 3: \"7 9 2\"\n            i=0: 7,9 -> 28\n            i=1: a=7-4=3, b=9-4=5 -> 2*(3+5)-4=16-4=12\n            total=28+12=40.\n\n        Example 4: \"4 4 1\"\n            w=4, h=4, k=1 -> 2*(4+4)-4=12.\n\n        Example 5: \"5 5 1\" -> 2*(5+5)-4=16.\n\n        Example 6: \"10 10 2\" -> \n            k_max = floor((10+1)/4)=floor(11/4)=2 -> valid.\n            i=0: 10,10 -> 2*(10+10)-4=36.\n            i=1: 10-4=6, 10-4=6 -> 2*(6+6)-4=20.\n            total=36+20=56.\n\n        Example 7: \"10 10 3\" -> \n            k_max = floor((10+1)/4)=2, so k=3 is not allowed. But the input condition says k is bounded by that, so we don't need to handle.\n\n        But note: the problem input constraint: \n            k <= floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)\n\n        So we assume the input k satisfies that.\n\n 7. However, wait: the problem says the input k is in the range [1, floor((min(w, h)+1)/4)].\n\n        Therefore, we can rely on the input.\n\n 8. Final code:\n\n        data = input().split()\n        if not data:\n            # but there should be one line with three integers\n            print(0)\n            exit(0)\n\n        w = int(data[0])\n        h = int(data[1])\n        k = int(data[2])\n\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(k):\n            a = w - 4*i\n            b = h - 4*i\n            total += 2*(a+b) - 4\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, let me test with the example from the problem: \n        Input: \"7 9 2\" -> Output: 40 -> correct.\n\nHowever, note that the example input is given as a list of strings: ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2'] but we are reading one line.\n\nBut the problem says: The only line contains three integers.\n\nSo we read one line.\n\nLet me run the provided examples:\n\n        Example 1: \"3 3 1\" -> 8\n        Example 2: \"7 9 1\" -> 28\n        Example 3: \"7 9 2\" -> 40\n\nAll match.\n\nHowever, wait: the example input format in the problem statement is given as a list of strings, but the actual input is one line.\n\nTherefore, we are good.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"The following is a competitive programming problem\", and the example input is shown as:\n\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\nBut in reality, the input will be one line. The example output is:\n\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nBut note: the example input is three separate inputs? Or is it one input containing three examples? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"The only line contains three integers\"\n\nSo we assume one line.\n\nWe'll write the code accordingly.\n\nHowever, if we are to run multiple test cases, the problem says \"The only line\", so we read one line.\n\nBut the example input is provided as a list of strings. That is just for illustration.\n\nCode:\n",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate by adding multiple concentric rings. Each ring is placed 2 cells away from the edge of the previous ring, starting from the outer edge of the plate. The solution involves determining the dimensions of each ring and computing the number of cells in its border.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The plate is divided into a grid of `w x h` cells. The first ring is the border of the entire grid. Each subsequent ring is 2 cells inward from the previous ring. The key observation is that for the i-th ring (0-indexed), the inner rectangle dimensions are `(w - 4*i) x (h - 4*i)`. The number of cells in the border of a rectangle of size `a x b` is given by `2*(a + b) - 4`, provided both dimensions are at least 2.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: For each ring from 0 to k-1, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle. Use the formula `2*(a + b) - 4` to find the number of cells in the border of each rectangle and sum these values across all rings.\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each of the k rings once, performing constant-time operations for each. Thus, the time complexity is O(k), which is efficient given the constraints (k ≤ floor((min(w, h) + 1)/4)).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    data = input().split()\n    w = int(data[0])\n    h = int(data[1])\n    k = int(data[2])\n    \n    total_cells = 0\n    for i in range(k):\n        a = w - 4 * i\n        b = h - 4 * i\n        if a >= 2 and b >= 2:\n            total_cells += 2 * (a + b) - 4\n    print(total_cells)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Initialization**: `total_cells` is initialized to accumulate the sum of cells in all rings.\n3. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 0 to k-1:\n   - **Compute Dimensions**: The dimensions of the inner rectangle for the current ring are `w - 4*i` and `h - 4*i`.\n   - **Check Validity**: Ensure both dimensions are at least 2 to use the border formula.\n   - **Calculate Border Cells**: The number of cells in the border is `2*(a + b) - 4`, which accounts for all cells along the edges of the rectangle.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all rings, the total number of gilded cells is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result by leveraging simple arithmetic operations and iterating through each ring once, adhering to the problem constraints.",
