Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\n Okay, we are given an integer n and two strings l and r of length n.\n We need to form as many pairs (one left and one right) as possible such that:\n   - The pair is compatible: \n        * If both are letters, they must be the same.\n        * If one or both are '?', then they are compatible (unless both are letters and different? Actually, note: '?' is indefinite and compatible with any. So:\n          ('?', 'a') -> compatible, ('a', '?') -> compatible, ('?', '?') -> compatible, but ('a','b') -> not.\n\n However, note: the problem says an indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite). So the conditions are:\n   - If l[i] is a letter and r[j] is a letter: then they must be equal.\n   - If l[i] is '?' OR r[j] is '?', then they are compatible.\n\n But note: the problem does not require to use all boots, and each boot can be used at most once.\n\n Approach:\n Since n can be up to 150000, we cannot try all pairs (n^2).\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We are going to count the maximum number of pairs. Then we have to output the pairs.\n\n 2. We can break down the problem:\n\n    We have two types of boots: specific and wildcard (represented by '?').\n\n    We can consider:\n\n    - Matching two specific boots (both letters) of the same color.\n    - Matching a specific boot with a wildcard (either side).\n    - Matching two wildcards.\n\n    However, note: a wildcard can be matched with any, so we want to use them in a way that maximizes the total.\n\n    Observation:\n\n    We can first match as many specific boots as possible, then use wildcards to match the rest.\n\n    But note: sometimes it might be beneficial to use a specific boot with a wildcard if there are too many of one color and few wildcards? Actually, no: because a specific boot should be matched with a boot of the same color, and if we have a specific boot and a wildcard, we can also use the specific boot with another specific boot of the same color if available. So we should use the wildcards only when necessary.\n\n    However, we are allowed to assign arbitrarily (any pairing as long as the colors are compatible). The goal is maximum pairs.\n\n    Let's think greedily:\n\n    We can separate the boots:\n\n        Left string: \n            - Specific colors: all non '?' characters.\n            - Wildcards: the '?' \n\n        Similarly for right.\n\n    But note: we cannot simply match all the wildcards with the leftover specific boots because the specific boots might have been already matched.\n\n    Actually, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Match as many specific boots as possible without using wildcards.\n\n        However, how to do that efficiently?\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a two-step approach:\n\n        Step 1: Count the frequency of each color (letter) in the left and right strings (ignoring '?').\n\n        Step 2: Then, the maximum matching from specific boots is the sum over each color c of min(freq_left[c], freq_right[c]). But wait: is that always true? Yes, because we can match two boots of the same color.\n\n        Then, the remaining boots (the ones that couldn't be matched by the same color) and the wildcards can be matched arbitrarily.\n\n        But note: the wildcards can be matched with any remaining boot (whether specific or wildcard). However, the remaining boots (after matching same-color) are:\n\n            For left: \n                - The specific boots that were not matched (because there were more in one side) and the wildcards.\n\n            Similarly for right.\n\n        Then the total pairs would be: \n            base = sum_{c} min(freq_left[c], freq_right[c])\n            Then we can use wildcards to match the remaining. The remaining boots (both left and right) are:\n\n            Let L_rem = n - base   [for left]\n            Let R_rem = n - base   [for right]\n\n            Then we can form at most min(L_rem, R_rem) additional pairs using wildcards (or even mixed: but note, the wildcards are part of the remaining). However, wait: the base calculation doesn't account for the fact that some wildcards might have been used in the base? No, because we ignored wildcards.\n\n        Actually, we did ignore wildcards. So:\n\n            We have:\n                left_string: [letters and '?']\n                right_string: [letters and '?']\n\n            Let:\n                base_left = { letter counts for left }\n                base_right = { letter counts for right }\n\n            base_pairs = 0\n            for each letter in base_left:\n                base_pairs += min(base_left[letter], base_right.get(letter,0))\n\n            Then, the remaining boots are:\n\n                left_remaining_letters = { letter: base_left[letter] - min(base_left[letter], base_right.get(letter,0)) } for each letter\n                right_remaining_letters = { letter: base_right[letter] - min(base_left.get(letter,0), base_right[letter]) } for each letter\n\n            Then, the total remaining boots (that are not wildcards) are the sum of the counts in left_remaining_letters and right_remaining_letters, and then we have the wildcards separately.\n\n            But note: the wildcards are not included in base_left and base_right. So we must account for the wildcards separately.\n\n        Actually, let's split the boots:\n\n            Left: \n                Let L_specific = [ch for ch in l if ch != '?']\n                Let L_wildcard = [ch for ch in l if ch == '?']   -> count of wildcards on left\n\n            Similarly for right.\n\n            Then, the base pairs from specific boots is base_pairs (as above, considering only letters).\n\n            Then, the remaining boots (that are either unmatched specific or wildcards) are:\n\n                Left: \n                    total_left_remaining = n - base_pairs   (because base_pairs used some specific boots, but note: base_pairs is the total pairs from specific boots, and each pair uses one left boot)\n\n                But wait, base_pairs is the total number of pairs from specific boots. Then the number of left boots used in base_pairs is base_pairs, so remaining left boots are n - base_pairs.\n\n                Similarly, remaining right boots are n - base_pairs.\n\n            Now, in the remaining, we have:\n\n                Left: \n                    specific_remaining = (total specific boots on left) - (number of specific boots used in base_pairs) \n                    But note: base_pairs doesn't tell us which specific boots were used. However, we can compute:\n\n                    total_left_specific = len([ch for ch in l if ch != '?'])\n                    used_left_specific = 0\n                    for letter in base_left:\n                        used_left_specific += min(base_left[letter], base_right.get(letter,0))\n                    Then, the remaining specific boots on left are total_left_specific - used_left_specific.\n\n                    And the wildcards on left are L_wildcard.\n\n                    Then, the remaining left boots are: (total_left_specific - used_left_specific) + L_wildcard = n - base_pairs   (since base_pairs is the total pairs from specific boots, and each pair uses one left boot, so base_pairs left boots are used, so n - base_pairs left boots remain).\n\n            Then, the total pairs we can form from the remaining is min(remaining_left, remaining_right) = n - base_pairs (because both sides have the same remaining). But wait, is that true? Actually, the remaining boots are n - base_pairs on both sides, so we can form up to n - base_pairs pairs? \n\n            However, note: the remaining boots are of two types: specific and wildcard. And the condition for compatibility is satisfied if at least one of the two is wildcard, or if they are the same letter? But wait, we already matched the same letter pairs. Now, in the remaining, we have:\n\n                Left: some specific boots (that didn't find a match in the base because the same color wasn't available) and wildcards.\n                Right: similarly.\n\n            The catch: two specific boots (from the remaining) of the same color? Actually, we already matched all the same-color pairs we could (base_pairs). So in the remaining, for each color, the counts are zero? \n\n            Actually, no: for a color c, we matched min(left_specific_count[c], right_specific_count[c]), so the remaining specific boots for color c is max(0, left_specific_count[c] - min(left_specific_count[c], right_specific_count[c]), right_specific_count[c] - min(left_specific_count[c], right_specific_count[c])).\n\n            But note: we cannot match two specific boots of the same color now because we've already taken the maximum possible. So the remaining specific boots must be of colors that don't have a match. And they are incompatible with each other (unless by chance we have two different colors that are the same? no, because we matched same color). Actually, two specific boots of the same color in the remaining would imply that we didn't match them because the other side had fewer? But then they are still the same color and we should have matched them all.\n\n            Correction: The base matching for a color c is min(left_specific_count[c], right_specific_count[c]). Then the leftover for color c is left_specific_count[c] - min(...) and right_specific_count[c] - min(...). These leftovers are not matched. But note: these leftovers are of the same color? Then why didn't we match them? Because the other side didn't have enough. However, these leftovers are still the same color. But wait, we are not allowed to match two left boots of color c with two right boots of color c if the right side only has one? Then we can only form one pair. \n\n            Actually, the base matching is the maximum for each color. So the remaining specific boots of the same color are just leftovers. They cannot be matched with each other because they are the same color and we have already taken the minimum. But note: they are the same color and we have more on the left than the right, then we cannot match them with anything else (except wildcards). \n\n            Therefore, the remaining specific boots (non-wildcard) are all of distinct colors (or at least, we don't care about their colors because they don't match the right's specific boots) and they are incompatible with each other and with the opposite side's specific boots (because the opposite side's specific boots of the same color have been exhausted). \n\n            So the remaining specific boots must be matched with wildcards.\n\n        Then, the problem reduces to:\n\n            We have a bipartite graph with two sets:\n\n                Left: \n                    - Some specific boots (each with a color) and some wildcards.\n                Right:\n                    - Some specific boots (each with a color) and some wildcards.\n\n            We know that:\n\n                - A specific boot (left) can be matched with a right boot if:\n                    * The right boot is of the same color (specific) OR\n                    * The right boot is a wildcard.\n\n                Similarly for the other way.\n\n            But note: we are allowed to use a wildcard on the left and a specific boot on the right (or vice versa) or two wildcards.\n\n            However, we are only concerned with maximum matching.\n\n            But note: we are going to form exactly base_pairs + (additional pairs) = ?\n\n            The total pairs we can form is at most n (if we can form a perfect matching). But note: we cannot exceed n.\n\n            How to compute the maximum?\n\n            We already have base_pairs from the specific boots.\n\n            Then, the remaining graph is:\n\n                Left nodes: \n                    Type A: specific boots (with color, say from set S)\n                    Type B: wildcard boots (we can denote as '*')\n\n                Right nodes:\n                    Type A: specific boots (with color)\n                    Type B: wildcard boots\n\n            And edges:\n\n                - Every specific left node is connected to:\n                    * All right nodes that are specific and have the same color, and\n                    * All right wildcard nodes.\n\n                - Every wildcard left node is connected to all right nodes (both specific and wildcard).\n\n            Similarly for right.\n\n            Now, we want to form as many pairs as possible from the remaining n - base_pairs left boots and n - base_pairs right boots.\n\n            However, we are constrained by the fact that we cannot use a boot twice.\n\n            This is a bipartite graph with two types of nodes. We can use a greedy matching:\n\n                Step 1: We have base_pairs already.\n\n                Step 2: We are going to form the remaining pairs. Note that the remaining graph has:\n\n                    Left: \n                        Let L1 = list of indices for left specific boots (remaining) -> we don't know the color, but we know the color for each.\n                        Let L2 = list of indices for left wildcards.\n\n                    Right:\n                        Let R1 = list of indices for right specific boots (remaining)\n                        Let R2 = list of indices for right wildcards.\n\n                The edges:\n\n                    For a left specific boot with color c, it can connect to:\n                        - All right specific boots with color c (but wait, we already took the base_pairs, so these are the leftovers of color c) and to all right wildcards.\n\n                    But note: the base_pairs already used up the same-color pairs. The remaining same-color pairs are the leftovers (so for color c, we have left_remaining_specific[c] and right_remaining_specific[c] from the same color). However, these leftover same-color boots are not connected by the base matching? Actually, we didn't use them, but they are not matched with each other because we already matched the maximum.\n\n                    But wait: we cannot match two same-color boots from the remaining because we don't have an edge between two left boots? We are in a bipartite graph: left and right. So the left specific boot of color c can only be matched with a right specific boot of color c or a wildcard. However, the right specific boot of color c in the remaining is the one that was not matched (from the base_pairs). \n\n                    But note: we might have multiple colors. However, the problem is that the same-color matching in the base_pairs already exhausted the possibility for same-color pairs. Therefore, the remaining same-color boots are not connected to each other (they are on the same side? no, they are on opposite sides). Actually, we have:\n\n                    In the remaining, for a color c, we have:\n                        left_side: x_c specific boots (leftover from left)\n                        right_side: y_c specific boots (leftover from right)\n\n                    Then, these x_c and y_c are the same color, but we cannot match them because we already matched as many as min(total_left[c], total_right[c]). So the leftover x_c and y_c are such that x_c = max(0, total_left[c] - min(total_left[c], total_right[c])) and y_c = max(0, total_right[c] - min(total_left[c], total_right[c])). \n\n                    Then, we can match the leftover same-color boots? Actually, no: because the base_pairs used the minimum, so the leftover same-color boots are the excess. But then, we can match a left specific boot of color c with a right specific boot of color c? But wait, we already did the maximum matching for that color. So we cannot form a new same-color pair because we have already matched as many as possible.\n\n                    Therefore, the remaining same-color boots (on left and right) cannot be matched with each other (because we are in a bipartite graph, and we are only allowed to match left with right). But note: we can use wildcards to match them. However, the wildcard can match any.\n\n            So the remaining graph is:\n\n                Left: \n                    - Specific boots (each with a color, and these colors are from the set of letters that are in excess on the left) and wildcards (which are flexible).\n\n                Right:\n                    - Specific boots (each with a color, and these colors are from the set of letters that are in excess on the right) and wildcards.\n\n            Now, we can form a pair if:\n\n                - A specific left boot (color c) can be matched with:\n                    * A right specific boot of color c? -> But wait, we said we cannot because we already matched the maximum. However, note: the base_pairs did not necessarily use all the same-color boots that exist? Actually, the base_pairs used the maximum for each color, so there is no same-color opportunity left. But wait: what if the base_pairs did not use a particular same-color pair because the color c was not considered? Actually, no: we considered every color.\n\n                Let me clarify: the base_pairs was computed by:\n                    base_pairs = 0\n                    for each letter c in the alphabet (or in the set of letters that appear in l or r):\n                        base_pairs += min(count_left[c], count_right[c])\n\n                Then, the leftover specific boots are:\n\n                    For left: for each color c, the count is max(0, count_left[c] - min(count_left[c], count_right[c]))\n                    For right: for each color c, the count is max(0, count_right[c] - min(count_left[c], count_right[c]))\n\n                And these leftovers cannot form a same-color pair because we have already taken the minimum. So they are unmatched.\n\n            Then, the remaining graph is:\n\n                Left: \n                    - The leftover specific boots (each with a color, and these colors are the ones that are in excess on the left) and the wildcards (which are just '*')\n                Right:\n                    - The leftover specific boots (each with a color, and these colors are the ones that are in excess on the right) and the wildcards.\n\n            Now, we can match:\n\n                - A specific left boot (color c) can be matched with:\n                    * Any right boot that is either a wildcard OR a specific boot of color c? -> Wait, but we already know that the same-color matching for c has been exhausted (so there is no right specific boot of color c available? Actually, the base_pairs already used all the right specific boots of color c that were available. The leftover right specific boots of color c are the ones that were in excess on the right, so they are still present. However, the base_pairs for color c is min(count_left[c], count_right[c]). Then the leftover right specific boots of color c are count_right[c] - min(count_left[c], count_right[c]]). \n\n                But note: the base_pairs for color c used min(count_left[c], count_right[c]) left boots and the same number of right boots. Therefore, the leftover left specific boots of color c are count_left[c] - min(count_left[c], count_right[c]] and the leftover right specific boots of color c are count_right[c] - min(count_left[c], count_right[c]].\n\n                Then, we can still use the specific left boot of color c to match with a right boot that is either:\n                    - A wildcard, OR\n                    - A specific boot of color c (but wait, we have leftover right specific boots of color c). However, we cannot match two left boots of color c with two right boots of color c? Actually, we are allowed to match a left boot of color c with a right boot of color c even if it is leftover? \n\n                Let me reexamine: \n\n                The base_pairs matching for color c: we matched as many as the minimum of the two. Then the remaining left specific boots of color c cannot be matched with any right specific boot of color c (because we have already matched all the right ones that are available). Actually, no: the base_pairs used min(count_left[c], count_right[c]) pairs, so the remaining left specific boots of color c (count_left[c] - min(...)) cannot be matched with the remaining right specific boots of color c (count_right[c] - min(...)) because we have already used the entire set of right specific boots of color c? \n\n                Actually, no: the base_pairs for color c used min(count_left[c], count_right[c]) left boots and min(count_left[c], count_right[c]) right boots. Then, the remaining right specific boots of color c are count_right[c] - min(count_left[c], count_right[c]]). But note: if count_left[c] >= count_right[c], then the remaining left specific boots of color c are count_left[c] - count_right[c] and the remaining right specific boots of color c are 0. Then, we cannot match the remaining left specific boots of color c with a right specific boot of color c.\n\n                Similarly, if count_left[c] < count_right[c], then the remaining left specific boots of color c are 0 and the remaining right specific boots of color c are count_right[c] - count_left[c]. Then, we cannot match the remaining right specific boots of color c with a left specific boot of color c.\n\n                Therefore, the same-color matching for the remaining is zero.\n\n            So the edges for the remaining graph are:\n\n                - A left specific boot (color c) can be matched with:\n                    * Any right boot that is a wildcard, OR\n                    * A right specific boot of a color d that is not c? -> NO, because the base_pairs already considered every color, and the same-color matching is exhausted. But wait, we haven't considered cross-color matching? \n\n                However, the problem states that two specific boots must be the same color. So cross-color matching (like 'a' and 'b') is not allowed. Therefore, the only possibilities for a specific left boot (color c) are:\n\n                    - Right boots that are either color c (but we don't have any available) OR wildcards.\n\n                Similarly, a left wildcard can be matched with any right boot (even if they are specific or wildcard).\n\n            Then, the problem becomes: \n\n                We have two sets:\n\n                    Left_set = \n                        Set1: specific boots (each with a color, and these colors are from the set of letters that are in excess on the left) and \n                        Set2: wildcards (each with no color)\n\n                    Right_set =\n                        Set1: specific boots (each with a color, from the set of letters that are in excess on the right) and \n                        Set2: wildcards.\n\n                We want to match as many as possible.\n\n                The constraints:\n\n                    - Each left node must be matched to a distinct right node.\n\n                How to maximize? \n\n                We can use the following:\n\n                    Let L = n - base_pairs   (remaining left boots)\n                    Let R = n - base_pairs   (remaining right boots)\n\n                Then, the maximum pairs we can form from the remaining is min(L, R) = n - base_pairs? \n\n                But wait: we have two types of edges. However, note that:\n\n                    - The specific left boots (Set1) can only be matched with wildcards (from Right_set2) and cannot be matched with specific right boots (Set1) because the same-color matching is exhausted and cross-color is not allowed.\n\n                    - Similarly, the specific right boots (Set1) can only be matched with wildcards (from Left_set2) and cannot be matched with specific left boots (Set1).\n\n                    - The wildcards (Left_set2) can be matched with anything (including specific right boots and other wildcards).\n\n                Therefore, the matching in the remaining graph is constrained.\n\n                We can model this as:\n\n                    We have:\n\n                        Left_specific: A (size a)\n                        Left_wildcard: W (size w)\n\n                        Right_specific: B (size b)\n                        Right_wildcard: X (size x)\n\n                    And the edges:\n\n                        Left_specific -> only Right_wildcard (X)\n                        Left_wildcard -> everything (Right_specific and Right_wildcard)\n                        Right_specific -> only Left_wildcard (W)\n\n                Then, the maximum matching we can get from the remaining is:\n\n                    We can use the wildcards to bridge the gap.\n\n                Let T = min(a + w, b + x)  [but actually, we are limited by the total remaining, which is n-base_pairs]\n\n                But note: we are only allowed to use each boot once.\n\n                We can break down:\n\n                    - The Left_specific (a) can only be matched with Right_wildcard (x). So we can form at most min(a, x) pairs from Left_specific.\n\n                    - The Left_wildcard (w) can be used in two ways:\n                        * To match with Right_specific (b): we can form min(w, b) pairs from Right_specific?\n                        * Or to match with Right_wildcard (x): but note, the Right_wildcard are already being used by Left_specific.\n\n                Actually, we have to consider:\n\n                    Total pairs from the remaining = ?\n\n                We can use:\n\n                    Let Y = min(a, x)   [pairs from Left_specific and Right_wildcard]\n\n                    Then, after using Y wildcards (from Right) for Left_specific, the remaining wildcards on the right are x - Y.\n\n                    Then, the Left_wildcard (w) can be used to:\n\n                        1. Match with Right_specific (b): we can form min(w, b) pairs, but wait: the Left_wildcard can also match with the remaining Right_wildcard (x - Y). So we should use the Left_wildcard first for Right_specific, then for Right_wildcard? Actually, no: we want maximum pairs.\n\n                    Actually, the Left_wildcard can match with any. So we can use them to match the Right_specific (which cannot be matched otherwise) and then the remaining Left_wildcard can match with the remaining Right_wildcard.\n\n                    However, we can also use the Left_wildcard to match with the Right_specific, but then we leave the Right_wildcard to match with Left_specific? But wait, Left_specific can only match with Right_wildcard.\n\n                    So the order:\n\n                        Step 1: Use Right_wildcard to match Left_specific as much as possible: Y = min(a, x)\n\n                        Step 2: Then, use Left_wildcard to match Right_specific as much as possible: Z = min(w, b)\n\n                        Step 3: Then, the remaining Left_wildcard (w - Z) and Right_wildcard (x - Y) can be matched arbitrarily: U = min(w - Z, x - Y)\n\n                    Then, total additional pairs = Y + Z + U.\n\n                And note: the total remaining boots is a + w = b + x = n - base_pairs.\n\n                Then, the total pairs is base_pairs + Y + Z + U.\n\n                And we must have: base_pairs + Y + Z + U <= n.\n\n                Also, note: the entire set of remaining boots is:\n\n                    Left: a + w = n - base_pairs\n                    Right: b + x = n - base_pairs\n\n                And the total pairs we form from the remaining is Y + Z + U, and we must have Y+Z+U <= n - base_pairs.\n\n                But note: the total pairs we form from the remaining is also the number of edges we use. And we are using:\n\n                    Y: from Left_specific and Right_wildcard\n                    Z: from Left_wildcard and Right_specific\n                    U: from Left_wildcard and Right_wildcard\n\n                Then, the total used boots from left: Y (from Left_specific) + Z (from Left_wildcard) + U (from Left_wildcard) = Y + Z + U (but wait, the Left_wildcard are used in Z and U, so total left used is Y (from specific) + (Z+U) (from wildcards) = Y + Z + U.\n\n                Similarly, from right: Y (from wildcards) + Z (from specific) + U (from wildcards) = Y+Z+U.\n\n                Therefore, we are using exactly Y+Z+U boots from the remaining, and we cannot use more than n-base_pairs (the total remaining boots).\n\n                And indeed, Y+Z+U = min(a, x) + min(w, b) + min(w - min(w, b), x - min(a, x))\n\n                But note: the entire remaining boots must be matched? Actually, no: we are forming a matching, but we are not forced to use all. However, we want the maximum.\n\n                However, we are constrained by the edges. The above process uses as many as we can.\n\n                But note: we cannot exceed the total remaining boots. And we are using exactly min(a,x)+min(w,b)+min(w-min(w,b), x-min(a,x)) pairs, and the total remaining boots is a+w and b+x, and we use Y+Z+U boots from left and the same from right.\n\n                However, is this the maximum? \n\n                Consider: we are matching:\n\n                    - Left_specific: only with Right_wildcard (which is safe)\n                    - Then, we use Left_wildcard to match Right_specific (which is the only way for Right_specific to be matched) and then Left_wildcard to match the leftover Right_wildcard.\n\n                This is optimal.\n\n            Therefore, the total pairs is:\n\n                base_pairs + min(a, x) + min(w, b) + min(w - min(w, b), x - min(a, x))\n\n            But note: we must account for the actual counts:\n\n                a = number of left specific boots remaining = total_left_specific - base_pairs   [but wait, base_pairs is the sum over all colors, so the specific boots used from left is base_pairs? Actually, no: base_pairs is the total pairs from specific boots, and each pair uses one left boot. Therefore, the left specific boots used is base_pairs? \n\n                Actually, the base_pairs is the total pairs from specific boots. Each specific pair uses one left specific boot and one right specific boot. Therefore, the number of left specific boots used is base_pairs, and the number of left specific boots remaining is (total_left_specific - base_pairs_used_from_left). But wait, base_pairs_used_from_left is base_pairs (because each pair uses one left boot). Similarly, the right specific boots used is base_pairs.\n\n                Then, the remaining specific boots on the left is: total_left_specific_initial - base_pairs, and similarly for the right.\n\n                But note: the total_left_specific_initial is the count of non '?' in l.\n\n                However, we defined:\n\n                    base_pairs = sum_{c} min(count_left_specific[c], count_right_specific[c])\n\n                Then, the left specific boots used is base_pairs, so the remaining left specific boots is (total_left_specific_initial - base_pairs) ??? \n\n                But wait: what if a color c has count_left_specific[c] = 5 and count_right_specific[c] = 3, then base_pairs for c is 3, and the left specific boots of color c used is 3, so remaining left specific boots of color c is 2. Then the total left specific boots remaining is the sum over c of max(0, count_left_specific[c] - min(count_left_specific[c], count_right_specific[c])).\n\n                And note: base_pairs is the total pairs from specific boots, but the total left specific boots used is base_pairs (because each pair uses one left boot). Therefore, the remaining left specific boots is (total_left_specific_initial - base_pairs).\n\n                Similarly, the remaining right specific boots is (total_right_specific_initial - base_pairs).\n\n                Then, the wildcards:\n\n                    left_wildcard = count of '?' in l = w_l\n                    right_wildcard = count of '?' in r = w_r\n\n                Then, the remaining left boots (both specific and wildcard) is: (total_left_specific_initial - base_pairs) + w_l = n - base_pairs   [because n = total_left_specific_initial + w_l]\n\n                Similarly, the remaining right boots is: (total_right_specific_initial - base_pairs) + w_r = n - base_pairs.\n\n                Now, the breakdown for the remaining graph:\n\n                    Left_specific = total_left_specific_initial - base_pairs   (let this be a)\n                    Left_wildcard = w_l   (let this be w)\n\n                    Right_specific = total_right_specific_initial - base_pairs   (b)\n                    Right_wildcard = w_r   (x)\n\n                Then, we can form:\n\n                    Y = min(a, x)   [matching Left_specific with Right_wildcard]\n                    Then, the remaining Right_wildcard is x1 = x - Y.\n\n                    Then, Z = min(w, b)   [matching Left_wildcard with Right_specific]\n                    Then, the remaining Left_wildcard is w1 = w - Z.\n\n                    Then, U = min(w1, x1)   [matching Left_wildcard with Right_wildcard]\n\n                Then, total additional pairs = Y + Z + U.\n\n                Then, the overall pairs is base_pairs + Y + Z + U.\n\n            However, note: we must also ensure that we don't use the same boot twice. And the above breakdown uses:\n\n                From left: \n                    Left_specific: Y boots\n                    Left_wildcard: Z + U boots\n\n                From right:\n                    Right_wildcard: Y + U boots\n                    Right_specific: Z boots\n\n            And we are not exceeding the available boots.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            Step 1: Read n, then two strings l and r.\n\n            Step 2: Precompute:\n\n                base_pairs = 0\n                count_left = dictionary for l (only for letters, ignore '?')\n                count_right = dictionary for r (only for letters)\n\n                For each color in the union of keys from count_left and count_right:\n                    base_pairs += min(count_left.get(color,0), count_right.get(color,0))\n\n            Step 3: Compute:\n\n                total_left_specific = n - l.count('?')\n                total_right_specific = n - r.count('?')\n\n                # The remaining specific boots on left: \n                a = total_left_specific - base_pairs   # because base_pairs is the number of left-specific boots used (each pair uses one left boot)\n                b = total_right_specific - base_pairs   # remaining specific boots on right\n\n                w_l = l.count('?')\n                w_r = r.count('?')\n\n                x = w_r   # remaining wildcards on right\n\n            Step 4: Compute:\n\n                Y = min(a, x)\n                Then, x_remaining = x - Y\n\n                Z = min(w_l, b)\n                Then, w_remaining = w_l - Z\n\n                U = min(w_remaining, x_remaining)\n\n                total_additional = Y + Z + U\n\n            Step 5: Then, the total pairs is base_pairs + total_additional.\n\n            But wait: is this the maximum? \n\n            However, note: we are not asked to compute the maximum pairs only, but also to output the pairs.\n\n            The problem requires to output:\n\n                Print k â€” the maximum number of compatible pairs.\n                Then k lines: for each pair, the index of the left boot and the index of the right boot.\n\n            How to output the pairs?\n\n            We must record the indices, not just the counts.\n\n            Therefore, we cannot just use counts; we need to know which boots to match.\n\n            Revised plan:\n\n            We are going to form two types of pairs:\n\n                Type 1: Same-color pairs (base_pairs) -> we can use a greedy matching for each color.\n\n                Type 2: Additional pairs (using wildcards) as described.\n\n            Steps for output:\n\n                We need to know the indices of the boots.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                Step 1: For the base_pairs, we want to match as many same-color pairs as possible.\n\n                We can iterate over the colors (from 'a' to 'z' and also include '?')? But note: '?' is wildcard and handled separately.\n\n                Actually, we should handle the base_pairs (same-color) first, and then the wildcards.\n\n            Let me design:\n\n                We are going to:\n\n                    - First, form the base_pairs (same-color) for each color (letter). For each color, we have:\n\n                        left_list[color] = list of indices i where l[i]==color and we haven't used this boot.\n                        right_list[color] = list of indices i where r[i]==color and we haven't used this boot.\n\n                    Then, for each color, we match min(len(left_list[color]), len(right_list[color])) pairs.\n\n                Then, for the remaining boots (both the specific and the wildcards), we have to form the additional pairs.\n\n            However, the problem is that the base_pairs matching is independent per color. Then, we can do:\n\n                Step 1: Initialize an array \"used_left\" of booleans (size n) and \"used_right\" of booleans (size n) to False.\n\n                Step 2: For each color in the set of letters (from 'a' to 'z'), do:\n\n                    Let lefts = all indices i (from 0 to n-1) such that l[i]==color and not used_left[i]\n                    Let rights = all indices j (from 0 to n-1) such that r[j]==color and not used_right[j]\n\n                    Then, take the minimum of the two lists, and mark those boots as used.\n\n                Step 3: Then, we have the remaining boots (both the specific and the wildcards). Now, we need to form the additional pairs.\n\n            Now, for the additional pairs, we have:\n\n                Left boots that are not used and are either '?' or a letter (but note: the letters that are not matched in the base_pairs are still there, but they are specific and cannot be matched by the base method).\n\n                We can use a bipartite graph for the remaining:\n\n                    Left: \n                        - The unused left boots (each has an index and a color: if it's a letter, then we have a specific color; if it's '?' then wildcard)\n                    Right:\n                        - The unused right boots (each has an index and a color)\n\n                And edges:\n\n                    - A left boot (whether specific or wildcard) can be matched with a right boot if:\n                         * If the left boot is a letter, then the right boot must be either the same letter or a wildcard.\n                         * If the left boot is wildcard, then any.\n\n                    But wait, the condition for specific boots is: same letter (and the right boot can be the same letter or wildcard). However, we are not allowed to use the same-color matching again (because we already did the maximum for each color). \n\n                Actually, note: the base_pairs already used the same-color pairs. Now,",
    "response": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) where each pair consists of boots with matching colors. The colors can be specific letters or wildcards ('?'), which can match any color. The solution involves efficiently matching as many boots as possible while respecting the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Matching of Specific Colors**: First, we match boots of the same specific color (non '?') on both left and right sides. This is done by counting occurrences of each color in both strings and forming pairs for each color up to the minimum count on either side.\n2. **Handling Wildcards**: After matching all possible specific color pairs, we handle the remaining boots, which include unmatched specific boots and wildcards. Wildcards can match any boot, so we use them to maximize additional pairs:\n   - **Left Specific Boots with Right Wildcards**: Match any remaining left-specific boots with right wildcards.\n   - **Left Wildcards with Right Specific Boots**: Then, use any remaining left wildcards to match with right-specific boots.\n   - **Left and Right Wildcards**: Finally, match any remaining left and right wildcards together.\n3. **Output the Results**: The total number of pairs is the sum of initial specific pairs and the additional pairs formed using wildcards. Each pair is recorded with the indices of the left and right boots involved.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n =

strings. It then forms pairs for each color up to the minimum count on either side.\n2. **Wildcard Handling**: After processing all specific color pairs, the code matches remaining left-specific boots with right wildcards, then uses any leftover left wildcards to match with right-specific boots. Finally, it matches any remaining wildcards together.\n3. **Output**: The total number of pairs is printed, followed by each pair's indices (left and right boot positions). The pairs are sorted by their indices for consistent output.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the number of compatible pairs by leveraging specific color matching first and then utilizing wildcards to cover any remaining boots, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
